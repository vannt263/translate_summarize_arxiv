    "spin - dependent transverse transport  the spin - hall effect ( she )  of classical waves and quantum particles is currently attracting growing attention in condensed - matter  @xcite , high - energy  @xcite , and optical  @xcite physics .",
    "this effect appears under bending of the wave trajectory in an external potential and is closely related to such fundamental phenomena as the berry phase , conservation of the total angular momentum ( am ) of the wave , and spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the optical she deals with evolution of gaussian - type wave beams bearing intrinsic _ spin _ am .",

    "orbital _ am  @xcite , an orbital - hall effect ( ohe ) appears under the bending of their trajectories .    extensive studies over the past several years mostly considered the semiclassical trajectory equations tracing evolution of the _ center of gravity _ of a wave beam rather than the propagation of real _ extended _ beams . at the same time , the typical transverse shift of the beam s center of gravity due to the she or ohe is proportional to the wavelength and is rather small as compared to the characteristic scale of the beam deformations in an inhomogeneous medium .",
    "therefore , it is important to give a picture of the evolution of realistic beams in a gradient - index medium , which includes she , ohe , and the diffraction processes .",
    "below we provide such a description of paraxial optical beams carrying spin and orbital am and evolving in a smooth gradient - index medium .",
    "although we consider maxwell equations , our analysis can readily be extended to quantum wave equations describing evolution of quantum particles in external potentials . in particular , the ohe arises from the laplace operator in curvilinear coordinates and is universal for any beams with vortices .",

    "( [ 15 ] ) is independent on the _ sign _ of the vortex , @xmath78 .    to conclude , we have derived a parabolic - type equation which describes propagation and diffraction of paraxial beams in a gradient - index medium and accounts for she and ohe . equations ( [ 13 ] ) and ( [ 14 ] ) enable one to separate the hall effects , which lift the degeneracy of states with opposite helicities @xmath47 and vorticities @xmath79 , and the diffraction effects described by eq .",
