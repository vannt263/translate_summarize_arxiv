    "massive stars have a strong influence on the surrounding interstellar space via their stellar winds and ultraviolet radiation .",
    "moreover , they end their lives in catastrophic supernova ( sn ) explosions , thus providing more energetic impact on the interstellar medium .",
    "wd2 is a rich star cluster of age @xmath5 myrs @xcite .",
    "co observations have allowed a distance estimate to the source of @xmath6 kpc ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the total stellar mass in wd2 is of the order of @xmath7 , including 12 o stars and 2 wr stars @xcite .",
    "it is also associated with a hii region rcw49 , a remarkable infrared nebula as revealed by @xmath8 @xcite , and perhaps with the extended tev gamma - ray source hess j1023 - 575 , discovered with the hess telescope array in the direction of the cluster @xcite .",
    "recently , low energy ( mev / gev ) gamma - rays have been reported from the same direction by the @xmath4 collaboration @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we describe the discovery of a spectacular jet and arc of molecular gas detected with the nanten telescope in the @xmath9co(@xmath10 ) mm - wave emission line survey @xcite , and discuss their possible links to the mev / gev and tev gamma - ray sources .",
    "we show the two new co features toward wd2 in figure 1 , where the co distribution in the velocity range @xmath11 km s@xmath12 is presented in galactic coordinates .",
    "one is a straight feature in the east at @xmath13 ( hereafter , the jet ) and the other an arc - like feature in the west at @xmath14 ( hereafter , the arc ) .",
    "we note that the arc has an intensity peak and a protrusion to the west of hess j1023 - 575 at @xmath15 , both of which lie along the jet axis , suggesting the existence of the diametrically opposite part of the jet .",
    "these two features show a remarkable correlation with wd2 / hess j1023 - 575 .",
    "the jet is extended over @xmath16 to the east of wd2 / hess j1023 - 575 , tilted at an angle of @xmath17 to the galactic plane , and is very well aligned with wd2 / hess j1023 - 575 as well as a ridge of the radio continuum corresponding to the hii region , rcw 49@xcite . a least - squares fitting to the jet in figure 1 yields a regression ,    @xmath18    where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are in degrees .",
    "this line passes through the @xmath21 error box of the peak position of hess j1023 - 575 , which is shifted from the center of the cluster by @xmath22 arcmin .",
    "the arc is apparently symmetric with respect to the jet axis and is well centered on hess j1023 - 575 .",
    "it appears somewhat rim - brightened along the outer boundary and shows a marked crescent shape , suggesting part of a swept - up shell . for convenience",
    "we define an axis @xmath23 , which runs along the direction of the jet and passes through the peak position of hess j1023 - 0575 , and an axis @xmath24 which is perpendicular to @xmath23 . here the origin of both @xmath24 and @xmath23 is @xmath25 .",
    "the velocity distributions of the two features are shown in two overlaid velocity channel maps ( figure 2a ) and in a position - velocity map along @xmath23 ( figure 2b ) .",
    "the jet is generally quiescent , having a velocity width of a few km s@xmath12 between @xmath26 but show fairly large widths of 10 km s@xmath12 at @xmath27 and @xmath28 , if all the features are assumed to be physically associated .",
    "we tentatively divide the molecular gas towards the jet into the following four components ;    j1 : a narrow component at @xmath29 located at @xmath30 km s@xmath12 with a linewidth of 1 @xmath31 2 km s@xmath12 , with little velocity gradient .",
    "this component has three local peaks at @xmath32 , and @xmath33 with a winding shape towards @xmath34 .",
    "j2 : a broad component at @xmath35 located over a velocity range of 19 @xmath31 30 km s@xmath12 .",
    "j3 : a fairly broad and localized feature at @xmath27 and @xmath36 km s@xmath12 , towards one of the peaks of j1 .",
    "j4 : the western component partially overlapping with the arc at @xmath37 and @xmath38 km s@xmath12 .    although it is not conclusive , we suggest that the four components of the jet are physically related as discussed later .",
    "the @xmath9co linewidth of the arc is @xmath39 km s@xmath12 centered at 26 km s@xmath12 , and we infer that the possible expansion velocity of the arc is not large .",
    "we shall here assume that the jet and arc are at @xmath40 kpc with a 30% error limit , and estimate the mass of each as follows , where an x factor of @xmath41 @xmath42 ( k km s@xmath12 ) is used to convert the @xmath9co intensity to molecular mass @xcite : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "the accuracy in mass is limited to @xmath48 because of the uncertainty in distance .",
    "we show the hi distribution at @xmath49 km s@xmath12 with a width of 0.82 km s@xmath12 in figure 3 @xcite .",
    "the hi shows a clear sign of a hole towards wd2 and hess j1023 - 575 .",
    "hereafter we shall call the hi feature surrounding the hole the hi shell .",
    "this shell is seen over a velocity range of 18 @xmath31 32 km s@xmath12 .",
    "we note that the velocity width of the hole is rather small , a few km s@xmath12 , suggesting that the possible expansion velocity is small at present .",
    "the hi hole has an elliptical shape with dimensions of @xmath30 pc by @xmath50 pc , elongated along the direction of s. it is noteworthy that the hi shell exhibits an intensity depression in its northern part , coincident with the molecular arc , suggesting that the arc and shell are physically related .",
    "this hi intensity depression is likely due to the conversion of hi into h@xmath51 .",
    "the jet is coincident with an elongated spur of hi extended to the east over @xmath52 , from @xmath53 to @xmath54 , while on the west there is little hi beyond the arc .",
    "the hi mass of the cloud shown in figure 3 amounts to @xmath55 in the velocity range 18 @xmath31 32 km s@xmath12 for a conversion factor of @xmath56 @xmath42 ( k km s@xmath57 @xcite .",
    "( 70mm,70mm)figure1.eps    ( 60mm,0mm)figure2.eps",
    "the co arc and hi shell suggest a spherical shock either due to a sn or stellar winds of wr stars .",
    "the secure lower limit for the kinetic energy involved in the arc is estimated to be @xmath58 ergs for a molecular mass of @xmath59 and an expansion velocity of 1 km s@xmath12 .",
    "a more likely estimate is perhaps @xmath60 ergs or more if we add the expansion energy of the hi gas to the expansion energy of the gas traced in co. a sn with mechanical energy @xmath61 ergs is more than sufficient to account for the energetics of the observed molecular and atomic gas , even when taking into account the conversion efficiency into kinetic energy of @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "there are many o stars in wd2 , whose collective mechanical wind energy may be large . for example 10 o - stars each with stellar - wind kinetic energy luminosities of @xmath63 erg s@xmath12 yield @xmath64 erg s@xmath12 . over a timescale of @xmath65 years",
    "the total kinetic power could reach @xmath66 ergs . with the same conversion efficiency , 0.1",
    ", a kinetic energy of @xmath67 ergs is available .",
    "the one - sided molecular jet can be explained in terms of in - situ conversion of hi into molecular gas by shock compression as a result of the jet propagating through the atomic medium over a projected length of @xmath0 pc .",
    "this is consistent with the huge mass of the molecular jet @xmath68 several times @xmath69 @xmath68 and the considerable amount of hi gas ( @xmath70 ) seen towards it .",
    "a lower limit for the time scale of the molecular jet is estimated to be @xmath71 yrs from the timescale of shocked co formation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "there are presently two other known candidates for molecular jets driven by high - energy jets @xmath68 ss433 and mjg348.5 @xcite .",
    "the physical parameters of the two molecular jets are estimated as follows ; full length @xmath72 pc , molecular mass @xmath3 , and minimum kinetic energy @xmath73 ergs . for the wd2 clouds",
    ", we roughly estimate such kinetic energy to be @xmath74 ergs from the mass , @xmath75 , and the velocity span , @xmath1 km s@xmath12 , of the dominant component j2 , which is somewhat larger than the above two cases .",
    "we note that an increased velocity dispersion at the far tip of the jet , as seen in j2 , is also observed in ss433 and mjg348.5 .",
    "this is interpreted as a result of the stronger dynamical interaction towards the tip of the jet , where the deceleration of the high - energy jet becomes most significant @xcite .",
    "we now consider the origin of the jet and arc . presently , there are two scenarios in which highly collimated flows of sufficient energy and length may be formed : ( i ) a highly anisotropic supernova explosion ; ( ii ) a high - energy accretion - powered jet from a compact object such as in a microquasar .",
    "anisotropic energy output is thought to have occurred in several known sne including cas a and w49b ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the expected speed of the jets is @xmath76 km s@xmath12 , suggesting a travel time of @xmath77 yrs over @xmath0 pc if the jet axis is nearly perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "theoretical calculations indicate that a strongly magnetized and rotating neutron star formed in a sne results in highly collimated jet @xcite .",
    "such explosions are able to release @xmath78 ergs in energy ( @xcite ) , and the compact remnant is expected to be observable as a magnetar .",
    "the frequency of known magnetars is low , with only 12 magnetars @xcite amongst the 1500 or so known pulsars @xcite , while jet - like features in historical snrs such as cas a suggest that the anisotropic sne may not be very rare . to summarize",
    ", the anisotropic sne scenario may well explain the jet and arc as caused by a single collimated sne .",
    "an alternative is that a conventional , isotropic sne occurred in a binary system , leading to the formation of an accretion - powered jet .",
    "for example , the microquasar ss433 , exhibits an x - ray jet of 150 pc and molecular jet of 400 pc in length ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in wd2 the arc and shell might be formed by the sn explosion , and the molecular jet by a long - lived microquasar jet .",
    "the ss433 jet has a momentum flow rate of @xmath79 yr@xmath12 and can supply @xmath80 ergs in kinetic energy in @xmath81 yrs ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , sufficiently large to supply the kinetic energy above .",
    "concerning the origin of the gamma - ray emission , the intriguing alignment of the gravity centers of both the @xmath4 and hess source positions with the molecular jet and arc suggests a common ( initial ) event , e.g. , a supernova explosion . the link could be direct , via radiation of relic particles produced at the sn explosion , or via on - going acceleration of particles by a relativistic object such as a remnant of the explosion , e.g. supernova remnant shell , a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) or a microquasar jet",
    "the first scenario favors a hadronic origin for the gamma - ray emission . because of severe radiative ( synchrotron and inverse compton ) losses , the relic ultrarelativistic electrons hardly could survive to the present epoch .",
    "indeed , for any reasonable parameters characterizing the ambient medium , the lifetime of multi - tev electrons is significantly shorter than the age of the system . on the other hand ,",
    "inverse compton radiation of gamma - rays by continuously accelerated electrons , e.g. , by a pwn , is a viable option .",
    "the gamma - ray luminosity is about @xmath82 erg s@xmath12 .",
    "if the main target for ic gamma - rays is the 2.7 k cmbr , this mechanism would require acceleration of tev electrons at a rate of @xmath83 erg s@xmath12 , or an order of magnitude less , if the optical radiation of stars plays a dominant role .",
    "the latter case can be realized when acceleration and radiation of electrons take place not far from the stars .",
    "the extended character of the gamma - ray emission excludes a single star origin for the observed tev emission . in this case",
    "the extension of the gamma - ray source is effectively determined by the volume occupied by stars , and consequently the size of the source is expected to be energy - independent .",
    "in contrast to this scenario , for a single pwn we expect an energy - dependent morphology caused by radiative energy losses which do not allow the highest energy electrons to propagate to large distances .",
    "such an effect is observed in the pwn hess j1825 - 137 @xcite . in the case of a hadronic scenario",
    "we expect just the opposite dependence .",
    "since generally the higher energy protons propagate faster than low energy protons , we might expect an increase of the angular size of the source with energy @xcite .",
    "another test to distinguish between the hadronic and electronic models is the ratio of gev and tev gamma - ray fluxes . in the case of the ic mechanism ,",
    "we expect suppression of low energy gamma - rays and a rather low gev / tev ratio .",
    "it is expected that future higher quality gev and tev data should allow us to conduct detailed a quantitative study of the morphological and spectral characteristics of the radiation in different energy bands , which could lead to definite conclusions .",
    "here we would prefer to limit the discussion by noting that the total energy required to explain the tev gamma - ray data reported by the hess collaboration for a source located at a distance of 5 kpc is about @xmath84@xmath85 erg .",
    "the co observations indicate a rather low density of gas in the region that coincides with the location of the tev gamma - ray source ( see above ) , most likely , @xmath86 @xmath87 .",
    "then the total budget in relativistic protons is required as large as @xmath88 erg .",
    "this can be considered as an argument in favor of a very strong sn explosion with total energy exceeding @xmath80 erg .",
    "in summary , our observations conducted with the nanten telescope in the @xmath9co(@xmath10 ) mm - wave emission led to the discovery of a spectacular jet and arc of molecular gas toward the young star cluster westerlund 2 which may be the result of a powerful supernova explosion .",
    "another consequence of this explosion could be the gev and tev gamma - ray sources located in the same region as reported recently by the @xmath4 and hess collaborations .",
    "further detailed studies of spectral and morphological features of gamma - ray emission are requited to explore the links between these two phenomena .",
    "the original nanten telescope was operated based on a mutual agreement between nagoya university and the carnegie institution of washington .",
    "this work is financially supported in part by a grant - in - aid for scientific research ( kakenhi ) from the mext and from jsps , in part , through the core - to - core program and by the donation from individuals and private companies ."
