    "in the last few decades , a great deal of experimental and theoretical research efforts have been devoted to perovskite manganites with chemical formulas of @xmath6mno@xmath5 ( @xmath7 = rare earth ions , @xmath8 = alkaline - earth ions ) because they show a rich variety of fascinating electromagnetic properties , such as the colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) , charge and orbital ordering ( coo ) and metal - insulator transition .",

    "another striking feature of our data is the large inhomogeneous broadening of the magnetic transition which is discussed below .",
    "one third of the initial asymmetry in the magnetically ordered state represents the signal from muons polarized along the direction of the internal field in a powder sample . since in our case",
    "this value corresponds to one third of the total asymmetry in the paramagnetic state , our data show that the volume fraction of magnetic phase is almost 100% .",

    "the solid curves indicate the best fit by the stretched exponential model for respective temperatures.,width=283 ]    the temperature dependence of @xmath45 reveals a peak at 280 k , somewhat below @xmath27 , and a broad maximum at 125 k. the peak at 280 k may be associated to a critical slowing down of mn magnetic moments usually accompanying the onset of ferromagnetic order , although the peak temperature is slightly lower than @xmath27 .",
    "we note , however , that this scenario has a difficulty .",
    "namely , here the transition region is very broad and in such case it is not clear that one can detect critical slowing down .",

    "namely , between 250 and 300 k , part of the fast relaxing ( at low temperatures ) component may be in fact observed in the @xmath2sr time signal . the inferred relaxation rate then may be the result of an interplay between the increase in the fast ( transversal ) relaxation rate and the gradual decrease in its weight .",
    "the very broad signal centered around 125 k , ranging from 50 k to 200 k , may be due to the change in a magnetic structure associated with the appearance of afi(ce ) phase in the fm phase below @xmath36 200 k.    at and below @xmath27 , the relaxation curve changes from an exponential ( @xmath82 ) form in the paramagnetic metal phase to a stretched exponential ( @xmath83 ) in the fm phase , suggesting a large distribution of the relaxation rates .",

    "la@xmath112ca@xmath113mno@xmath5 @xmath106 decreases ( @xmath105 increases ) upon cooling below @xmath27 , while @xmath106 is almost independent of temperature below around 170 k for the insulating ferromagnet la@xmath114ca@xmath115mno@xmath5 that shows a transition to a co state below around 60 k.@xcite the temperature independent @xmath106 below around 250 k for labamn@xmath0o@xmath1 , which is qualitatively similar to that for la@xmath114ca@xmath115mno@xmath5 , indicates that the relatively insulating region survives even in the fm phase .",
    "the weak metallic nature of the fm phase in labamn@xmath0o@xmath1 may be consistent with the appearance of afi(ce ) phase inside the fm phase at low temperature .",
    "in conclusion , our zero - field @xmath2sr data reveal striking differences in the magnetically ordered phases of ybamn@xmath0o@xmath1 and labamn@xmath0o@xmath1 . for the former ,",
    "a homogeneous state is observed , as expected for an a - site ordered manganite . for the latter ,",
    "unexpectedly one finds inhomogeneous magnetic phases below room temperature .",
    "it is not clear what triggers these important differences in our two materials . on the other hand ,",
    "the a - site order triggers important changes in the thermal and transport properties of the y compound , but not in the la - compound .",
    "the inhomogeneous magnetic phase of the la compound is reminiscent of the findings in ( la@xmath91pr@xmath92)@xmath93sr@xmath94mn@xmath0o@xmath95 , where an inhomogeneous magnetic phase is thought to be triggered by peculiar stacking faults leading to inter - growth of different magnetic layers . but this mechanism does not seem to apply for the y - compound .",
    "we consider a possible muon site in ybamn@xmath0o@xmath1 on the basis of previous works in lamno@xmath5 .",
    "the crystal structure of lamno@xmath5 has an orthorhombic cell with space group @xmath116 , where the mn ions are located at the ( 0 , 0.5 , 0 ) positions.@xcite cestelli guidi _",
    "_  have proposed two muon sites ; ( 0.389 , 0.937 , 0.25 ) and ( 0.5 , 0.5 , 0 ) for lamno@xmath5.@xcite the first site , close to the holzschuh site found for orthoferrites,@xcite is about 1.1  distant from an apical oxygen and farthest away from positive la ions in the lao plane .",
    "the second site is located in the large empty space at the center of the mno@xmath0 plane .",
    "independently , heffner _",
    "et al . _ have reported similar muon sites.@xcite    the crystal structure of ybamn@xmath0o@xmath1 has a monoclinic cell with space group @xmath117 .",
    "there are two mn sites , trivalent mn(1 ) at ( 0.018 , 0.005 , 0.242 ) and tetravalent mn(2 ) at ( 0.481 , 0.518 , 0.244 ) , and eight oxygen sites , o(1 ) @xmath36 o(8 ) in the unit cell at 350 k.@xcite muons bound to apical oxygens , o(1 ) and o(2 ) in the yo plane and o(7 ) and o(8 ) in the bao plane of ybamn@xmath0o@xmath1 , may be closely related to the first muon site in lamno@xmath5 , while muons bound to planar oxygens o(3 ) @xmath36 o(6 ) in the mno@xmath0 plane may be closely related to the second muon site .",
    "considering that dipolar fields dominate the local field at the muon site in lamno@xmath5,@xcite we have estimated the fields at about 1   apart from the eight oxygens and in the large empty space around ( 0 , 0.5 , 0.25 ) in the mno@xmath0 plane of ybamn@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "for this purpose we adopted ( i ) the structural parameters at 350 k proposed by x - ray and neutron powder diffractions,@xcite ( ii ) the ce - type magnetic structure in the mno@xmath0 plane with the @xmath34-type stacking along the @xmath11 axis@xcite and ( iii ) 2.65@xmath118 for mn@xmath72 ion and 3.89@xmath118 for mn@xmath32 ion as reported for camno@xmath5 and for lamno@xmath5 from neutron diffraction , respectively.@xcite although this assumption changes slightly the estimated values of dipolar fields with respect to a preliminary report,@xcite it does not affect the conclusion respect to the muon site .",
    "we found a possible muon site at @xmath71 , being in rough agreement with the observed local fields of 0.15 , 0.18 and 0.66 t. this position is about 1.2   away from o(7 ) in the bao plane and indicated by blue stars in the inset of fig .",
    "4(c ) , where all the plotted stars are crystallographically equivalent .",
    "it is close to the first muon site proposed in lamno@xmath5 , but not exactly the same .",
    "one may not expect to have exactly the same muon sites , because the o - ion displacements from their ideal positions are much smaller in ybamn@xmath0o@xmath1 than those in lamno@xmath5 .",
    "in addition , the spatial distribution of electrostatic potential are expected to be different each other , because mn@xmath32 and mn@xmath72 have the checker board type ordering in the mno@xmath0 plane of ybamn@xmath0o@xmath1 , while the valence of mn ion is uniform for lamno@xmath5 . for this muon site , we find four magnetically inequivalent muon sites with the dipolar fields of 0.208 , 0.232 , 0.235 , and 0.580 t along the @xmath90-axis .",
    "the multiple magnetically inequivalent sites arise from the ce - type magnetic structure in the mno@xmath0 plane with the large magnetic unit cell .",
    "the transferred hyperfine field may account for the small difference between the estimated dipolar fields and the experiments as mentioned in the section iii.a .",
    "our estimates are also consistent with the observed intensity in the fourier transformed spectrum where intensity at @xmath64 is twice as large as those at @xmath63 and @xmath65 .",
    "regarding our chosen muon site , it seems very likely that positive muons stop in the bao plane by two reasons ; ( i ) ba@xmath10 has smaller positive charge than y@xmath32 , ( ii ) the average distance between bao and mno@xmath0 planes is larger by 25% than that between yo and mno@xmath0 planes due to the distortion of mno@xmath1 octahedra.@xcite in addition , muons may favor a position near o(7 ) rather than a position near o(8 ) in the bao plane , because the nearest mn ion to o(7 ) is trivalent mn(1 ) while that to o(8 ) is tetravalent mn(2 ) .",
    "regarding labamn@xmath0o@xmath1 , it seems reasonable to assume its muon site to be the position related to holzschuh site or its symmetric replica for orthoferrites.@xcite in the tetragonal cell of labamn@xmath0o@xmath1 , there are three oxygen sites ; o(1 ) at ( 1/2 , 1/2 , 0 ) in the lao plane , o(2 ) at ( 1/2 , 0 , 0.2373 ) in the mno@xmath0 plane and o(3 ) at ( 1/2 , 1/2 , 1/2 ) in the bao plane at 400 k.@xcite there are no o - ion deviations from the ideal positions in bao plane of labamn@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "we propose that the muon lies at ( 0.755 , 1/2 , 1/2 ) in the bao plane , 1   away from o(3 ) towards the midpoint between two adjacent ba ions .",
    "we estimated the dipolar sums over a large spherical domain centered at the proposed muon site in the fm phase , assuming a uniform ferromagnetic state . in the estimation",
    ", we used the structural parameters at 400 k and the mn magnetic moment 3.0 @xmath119 from the magnetization in 5 t , where the afi(ce ) phase is suppressed by the magnetic field.@xcite the estimated dipolar field is 0.38 t , corresponding to the muon frequency of 51.5 mhz .",
