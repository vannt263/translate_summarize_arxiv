    "consider the bell - state analyzer ( bsa ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bs - bsa]a , such as the one used in the experimental demonstration of dense coding @xcite .",
    "this bsa is capable of separating the four bell states into 3 classes , resulting in a  trit \" ( @xmath10 bits ) of transmitted information .",
    "a 50 - 50 beam splitter is used to separate @xmath1 from @xmath2 , @xmath3 : bosonic symmetry requires that photons in @xmath1 end up in different outputs while photons in @xmath2 , @xmath3 end up in the same output @xcite . with the polarizing beam splitters ( pbs ) separating @xmath4 and @xmath5 polarizations , coincidences at @xmath11 or @xmath12 are the signature of @xmath1 . the pbs separate @xmath2 from @xmath3 : coincidences at @xmath13 or @xmath14 are characteristic of @xmath2 . for @xmath3 , we have two photons at @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "thus , detection of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 requires detectors capable of distinguishing between one and two photons .",
    "such detectors are presently available , however they suffer from low efficiencies and/or high dark counts @xcite . as mentioned in refs .",
    "@xcite , this problem can be partially solved by replacing each detector with two detectors and an additional 50 - 50 beam splitter .",
    "this enables one to detect only half of the two - photon occurrences and increases the complexity of the detection system , since an eight detector system is necessary .",
    "we could avoid this requirement on the detectors if we could invert the interference behavior : photons in the triplet ( singlet ) states go to different ( the same ) detectors and can then be further discriminated by the pbs .",
    "this can be achieved by generating polarization - entangled photons using an antisymmetric pump beam , such as the first - order hermite - gaussian beam @xmath19 , as we will show below .",
    "then , pumping with @xmath19 , @xmath1 results in two photons in either output port .",
    "since the two photons are orthogonally polarized , coincidences at detectors @xmath13 or @xmath14 are the signature of @xmath1 .",
    "the states @xmath2 and @xmath3 give one photon in each output port .",
    "since the photon pairs of @xmath2 are orthogonally polarized , @xmath2 gives coincidence counts at detectors @xmath11 or @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath3 results in coincidence counts at @xmath21 or @xmath22 .",
    "all detector combinations identifying the three cases @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath3 correspond to coincidences at different detectors .",
    "let us now discuss multimode interference and show how an antisymmetric pump beam inverts the interference behavior . a two - mode bell - state , as given by eq .",

    "[ fig : bs - bsa]b , must preserve its overall bosonic character . thus if the polarization component of the state is symmetric ( antisymmetric ) , then the spatial component must also be symmetric ( antisymmetric ) @xcite .",
    "however , if we consider multimode fields , we must also take into account the transverse spatial properties of the two - photon state as additional degrees of freedom .",
    "the combined transverse - spatial and polarization symmetry of the two - photon wave packet determines whether the fields will interfere constructively or destructively . here",
    "we consider photon pairs created by spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) incident on opposite inputs of a beam splitter @xcite . a field reflected by the beam splitter undergoes a reflection in the horizontal ( @xmath23 ) direction , while a transmitted field does not suffer any reflection , as illustrated in fig .",

    "we are working in the paraxial and monochromatic approximations , and have assumed that the beam splitter is @xmath38-@xmath38 and symmetric .",
    "furthermore , we disregard any entanglement between the momentum and polarization degrees of freedom .",
    "the @xmath39 term in the @xmath40 functions are a consequence of the reflection of both fields at the beam splitter .    a quick look at ( [ eq : psi ] ) and ( [ eq : phi ] ) shows that when the pump beam profile is an even function of @xmath23 , only @xmath1 gives coincidence counts at the outputs of the bs ( fig .",

    "if the pump beam profile is an odd function of @xmath23 , then @xmath3 and @xmath2 give coincidence counts , while @xmath1 results in two photons in the same output of the beam splitter .",
    "thus , using a pump beam profile that is an odd function of @xmath23 gives the desired interference effects for our bsm scheme mentioned above .",
    "a well known class of beams with cartesian parity are the hermite - gaussian ( hg ) beams , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a normalization constant .",

    "a uv mirror is used to reflect the pump beam . a half - wave plate ( hwp ) and quarter - wave plate ( qwp )",
    "are used to select between the four bell states @xcite .",
    "trombone mirror assemblies are used to direct the down - converted beams onto a @xmath38-@xmath38 beam splitter ( bs ) .",
    "the relative path length is adjusted by moving mirror assembly @xmath56 with a motorized translation stage .",
    "the bs is mounted on a translation stage and can be moved in and out of the down - converted beams .",

    "polarization analysis ( bs and pbs removed ) of the four bell states generated with a @xmath19 pump beam gave interference curves ( not shown ) with visibilities @xmath60 , which were comparable to results when a gaussian pump beam was used .",

    "[ fig : hom - psi ] shows the hom interference for the states @xmath28 and @xmath63 when the @xmath19 beam is used and the pbs were removed .",
    "visibilities of @xmath66 were achieved with the @xmath19 mode , which were slightly lower than with a gaussian pump beam ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "this was most likely due to misalignment of the wire in the laser cavity , as well as an increased sensitivity to alignment of the interferometer with the @xmath19 pump beam .",

    "we wish to show how the use of an antisymmetric pump beam can improve on these results .",
    "using an antisymmetric pump beam such as the first - order hermite gaussian beam @xmath78 , it is easy to show that after the first set of beam splitters ( bs ) , the states ( [ eq : hpsi ] ) , ( [ eq : hphi ] ) are @xmath79 after the polarizing beam splitters ( pbs ) at @xmath80 and @xmath81 , these states become @xmath82 each of these states has its own signature of detectors firing _ in coincidence_.",

    "we have shown how that this simplifies the standard methods for incomplete bell - state analysis of down - converted photon pairs , removing the necessity for detectors sensitive to photon number .",
    "in addition , we have shown that we can improve on a previous scheme for complete bell - state analysis of down - converted photon pairs using hyperentanglement @xcite , enabling complete bell - state analysis in the coincidence basis .",
    "these results illustrate the use of additional degrees of freedom of the two - photon state as a control parameter in quantum state engineering .",
