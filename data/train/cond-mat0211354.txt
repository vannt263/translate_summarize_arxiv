    "the double - exchange ( de ) model @xcite is one of the basic ones in the theory of magnetism .",
    "magnetic ordering appears in this model due to hund exchange coupling between the core spins and the mobile carriers .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the electrons annihilation and creation operators , @xmath3 is the operator of core spin , @xmath4 is the electron hopping , @xmath5 is hund exchange coupling between a core spin and a conduction electron , @xmath6 is the vector of the pauli matrices , and @xmath7 are spin indices .",
    "the model ( the core spins being treated as classical vectors ) was thoroughly studied already in the papers @xcite . during the last years , because of a general interest in manganites , the model was brought in the focus of attention , and a lot more was achieved ( see reviews @xcite and references therein ) . however , some basic properties of the model are still known only partially . for example , most of the papers dealing with the de model , starting from classical paper by de gennes @xcite , considered the de hamiltonian with infinite exchange ( and with the addition of the antiferromagnetic superexchange , which is crucial for the explanation of magnetic properties of manganites ) .",
    "the other extremity which was studied is the particular case of weak exchange ( much less than the electron bandwidth ) , when the de hamiltonian can be reduced to ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) hamiltonian ( see review @xcite and references therein ) .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the temperature of a ferromagnet - paramagnet transition @xmath8 in a double - exchange model for arbitrary relation between hund exchange coupling and electron band width by solving the dynamical mean field approximation equations .",
    "note that we treat the core spins as classical vectors .",
    "( when the quantum nature of the core spins is taken into account , the hamiltonian ( [ hamdxm ] ) , which in this case is often called the periodic kondo model , becomes much more complicated ; only scanty results were obtained for the model up to now . ) the problem of classical spins , as we shall see , combines tractability with rich and interesting physics .",
    "like it was said above , we consider spins as classical vectors @xmath9 with the normalization @xmath10 , thus the de hamiltonian in a single electron representation can be presented as @xmath11 we have a problem of electron scattered by core spins , the probability of any given core spin configuration depending upon the energy of electron subsystem . to solve the problem",
    "we will use the dynamical mean field approximation ( dmfa ) ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    in this approach , first we calculate an averaged , with respect to random orientation of core spins , density of states of electron in a random core spins configuration , treating electron scattering in a single site approximation , and considering the probability of any configuration as given .",
    "we introduce green s function @xmath12 in this approximation the averaged locator @xmath13 is expressed through the the local self - energy @xmath14 by the equation @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the bare ( in the absence of the exchange interaction ) locator .",
    "the self - energy satisfies equation @xmath17 where @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is a probability of a given spin orientation ( one - site probability ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath20 and @xmath14 are @xmath21 matrices in spin space .    in pm phase @xmath22 , the averaging in eq .",
    "( [ cpa ] ) can be performed explicitly , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a unity matrix , and we obtain @xmath26    to first approximation of the dmfa , leading to eq .",
    "( [ cpa ] ) , has a simple physical meaning .",
    "we reduce the problem of electron scattering due to many spins , each with the scattering potential @xmath27 , to a problem of a scattering due to a single spin with the effective scattering potential @xmath28 , embedded in an effective medium , described by the hamiltonian @xmath29 , and , hence , by locator @xmath30 .    the same mf approach leads to the second dmfa approximation - the approximation for the one - site probability @xmath19 , which allows to perform averaging in fm phase .",
    "consider again a single spin with the effective scattering potential in an effective medium .",
    "the change in the number of states of the electron gas due to such spin is @xcite @xmath31,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 .",
    "so the change in thermodynamic potential is @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the fermi function , the chemical potential is found from the equation @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the number of electrons per site .",
    "the result for the one - site probability reads : @xmath37.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    eqs .",
    "( [ cpa ] ) and ( [ prob2 ] ) are the system of two non - linear ( integral ) equations for @xmath38 and @xmath19 , which one should solve to find thermodynamic properties of the model .",
    "however , in linear approximation with respect to macroscopic magnetization @xmath39 , we can reduce this complicated system to a traditional mf equation for @xmath39 @xcite : @xmath40 the parameter @xmath8 is formally introduced as a coefficient in the linear term of the expansion of @xmath41 with respect to @xmath39 ( the reason for the notation we have chosen and for the numerical coefficient 3 will be clear immediately ) ; it is determined by the properties of the system in paramagnetic phase .",
    "non - trivial solution of the mf equation @xmath42 can exist only for @xmath43 , hence @xmath8 the curie temperature .",
    "for simplicity consider the semi - circular ( sc ) bare density of states ( dos ) @xmath44 , the bandwidth being @xmath45",

    "formally speaking because the integral in eq .",
    "( [ theta ] ) contains fermi function critical temperature enters also into the r.h.s . of the equation .",
    "but in all cases @xmath8 turns out to be much less the chemical potential , so we can consider electron gas as degenerate , and eq .",
    "( [ theta ] ) is an explicit formula for calculation of @xmath8 .",
    "( [ theta ] ) is the main result of our paper .",
    "the analysis of this equation let us start from the limiting case @xmath51 . in this case integral can be calculated explicitly and we obtain @xcite @xmath52,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is an implicit function of concentration , given by equation @xmath54 .",
    "the result coincides with that known previously @xcite .    for arbitrary exchange",
    "the integral can be calculated only numerically , but before we present the results of calculations we should state that in part of the @xmath55 plane eq .",
    "( [ theta ] ) gives @xmath56 .",
    "in fact , like in any mf theory of a second order phase transition , in our calculation of the critical temperature we started from a high temperature paramagnetic phase and decreasing the temperature were looking for an instability of a model with respect to appearance of small spontaneous magnetic moment that is for the appearance of a nontrivial solution of the mf equation .",
    "negative @xmath8 in some part of the @xmath55 plane means , that at any temperature , including @xmath57 , the paramagnetic phase here is stable with respect to the appearance of small spontaneous magnetic moment even at @xmath57 , and excludes ferromagnetism in that region of the plane .",
    "the part of the critical surface corresponding to the region of the parameters plane where @xmath58 is presented on fig . 1 .",
    "= 3truein    [ fig.1 ]",
    "let us finally discuss , whether the pm - fm transition observed with decreasing temperature can be preceded by the transition from the the pm phase to some magnetic phase other than fm ( say , antiferromagnetic ) ?",
    "we would like to present some heuristic arguments that this is not the case .",
    "first , consider the case of weak exchange @xmath59 . in this case eq .",
    "( [ theta ] ) takes the form @xmath60 in fact , this equation is the mf approximation @xcite for the rkky hamiltonian @xcite , to which the original hamiltonian ( [ hamdxm ] ) can be reduced to in the case @xmath59 .",
    "so eq . ( [ rkky2 ] )",
    "does not involve either the coherent potential approximation ( eq . ( [ cpa ] ) ) , or the sc density of states .",
    "anyhow , for the sc density of states we use , eq . ( [ rkky2 ] ) gives ferromagnetic ground state for @xmath61 , which qualitatively agrees with the result of numerical calculations , giving fm ground state for @xmath62 for the three principal cubic lattices @xcite .",
    "to formulate the second argument , let us compare the energies of the pm state @xmath63 and of the saturated fm state @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the appropriate fermi energy . on fig .",
    "2 we plotted simultaneously the curve given by by equation @xmath66 and by equation @xmath67 , where @xmath8 is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ theta ] ) .",
    "the close vicinity of the abovementioned curves supports the belief that the curve @xmath67 is the quantum critical line ( see @xcite and references therein ) , which bounds _ ferromagnetic _ phase . also , the boundary of ferromagnetic phase on fig .",
    "2 agrees with those obtained on the basis of numerical calculations @xcite and from qualitative reasoning @xcite .",
    "the destruction of ferromagnetic ground state occurs because finite double exchange between the itinerant electrons and core spins , unlike an infinite one , by itself generates effective antiferromagnetic exchange between the core spins ( which was absent in original hamiltonian ) . due to the fact that our main result ( equation for the transition temperature ) indicates it s own limits of validity",
    ", we can find the boundaries of ferromagnetic phase without analyzing what phases are beyond the boundaries .",
    "finally , we would like to mention , that in the dmfa , as one can easily see from eq .",
    "( [ cpa ] ) , density of electron states in paramagnetic phase does not depend upon electron concentration . in this case , the derivative of chemical potential with respect to number of electrons is just the inverse density of states at the fermi level ( for the degenerate electron gas ) , and is always positive .",
    "hence , there is no phase separation in paramagnetic phase .    in conclusion",
    ", we explicitly formulated the dynamical mean field approximation equations for the double exchange model with classical spins for arbitrary relation between hund exchange and the electron bandwidth .",
    "near paramagnetic - ferromagnetic transition critical point , these equations were reduced to a mf equation , describing a single spin in an effective field , proportional to the macroscopic magnetization .",
    "the effective exchange interaction , entering into the mf equation was found for the semicircular electron density of states .",
    "we thus calculated the transition temperature @xmath8 as a function of hund exchange interaction and electron density in the whole parameters plane .",
    "the results obtained also allow to plot the boundaries of the ferromagnetic region on the model phase diagram ."
