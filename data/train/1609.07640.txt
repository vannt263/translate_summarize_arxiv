    "the hybrid quantum systems have a potential to exhibit new emergent phenomena through merging the strength of different media @xcite .",
    "a quantum dot ( qd ) embedded between normal ( n ) and s - wave superconducting ( s ) leads ( n - qd - s ) is one of such devices , which has received considerable attentions from both the theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite communities in the past two decades .",
    "in such a hybrid system , two important phenomena may arise : one is the andreev tunneling ( at ) @xcite and the other is the screening of the localized spin in the qd by conduction electrons in the leads . while the former induces the andreev bound states ( abss ) located in the supreconducting gap , the latter is the famous kondo effect @xcite . the competition between these two processes results in a profound influence on the ground state properties @xcite as well as the transport behaviors of the devices @xcite .    for a molecular qd",
    ", it was found that vibrational degrees of freedom are easily excited when electronic tunneling takes place @xcite , which has a dramatic influence on the transport of the system due to the presence of inelastic tunneling processes mediated by emission or absorption of phonons @xcite . in recent years",
    ", phonon - assisted inelastic at in an n - qd - s system also leads to interesting physics on , for example , the electronic transport @xcite , the heat generation @xcite , the ground - state cooling @xcite , the steady - state shot noise @xcite , as well as the transient dynamics under a step bias @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , the phonon - assisted at can lead to resonant peaks every time the bias voltage changes by one phonon energy or the gate voltage changes by half a phonon energy @xcite , which has been unambiguously observed in a recent experiment @xcite .",
    "this is somewhat reminiscent of normal systems where phonon sidebands of kondo cotunnelings @xcite and single - electron tunnelings @xcite are also separated by one phonon energy in the bias voltage .",
    "since the n - qd - s setup fabricated in the experiment @xcite is indeed an ideal platform to explore the kondo physics , it is our aim in this paper to provide a theoretical study of the kondo transport in such a device .",
    "our investigation reveals that the interplay of the kondo correlations , the superconductivity , and the mechanical vibrations of the qd gives rise to distinct transport characteristics , as compared with those arising from the conventional phonon - assisted ats @xcite .",
    "the main physical scenario is illustrated in fig.[fig1 ] , where elastic and inelastic at with and without the kondo effect are schematically shown .",
    "we set the chemical potentials of the n ( @xmath0 ) and s ( @xmath1 ) leads as @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and the superconducting gap @xmath4 is taken as the largest energy scale in the problem .",
    "we consider the parameter regime where the qd - s tunnel coupling is much larger than the n - qd coupling and both are several times smaller than the onsite coulomb repulsion , such that the kondo effect and the onsite pairing coexist @xcite . in this case , two andreev bound states ( abss ) separated roughly by the coulomb energy form at @xmath5 and their widths are determined by the n - qd coupling @xcite . at zero bias @xmath6 , a spin-@xmath7 localized electron and",
    "a spin-@xmath8 lead electron at @xmath0 can convert to a cooper pair in s , while another spin-@xmath8 lead electron at @xmath0 transits into the qd simultaneously [ fig.[fig1](a ) ] .",
    "this spin - flip cotunneling process , to which we refer as the kondo - andreev tunneling , is elastic and accounts for the zero - bias conductance peak previously observed in this system @xcite .",
    "when the bias increases to @xmath9 ( @xmath10 the phonon energy ) , besides the elastic kondo - andreev tunneling process , additional inelastic kondo - andreev tunneling emitting one phonon can also take place [ fig.[fig1](b ) ] .",
    "here , the emission of a phonon fulfills the energy conservation of the transition that two n - lead electrons each with energy @xmath11 in the initial state are annihilated and a cooper pair with zero energy is created in the final state , while the qd energy under the spin flipping remains the same . at negative bias @xmath12 , similar inelastic kondo - andreev tunneling can occur from the s lead to the n lead [ fig.[fig1](c ) ] .",
    "the opening of these additional tunneling channels would give rise to additional conductance peaks at @xmath13 .",
    "when multiple - phonon processes are involved , a series of sidebands separated by half a phonon energy are thus expected at @xmath14 with @xmath15 .     and",
    "inelastic [ ( b ) , ( c ) , ( e ) , ( f ) ] electronic tunnelings in an n - qd - s system .",
    "( a)-(c ) represent the kondo - andreev tunnelings through an interacting qd with the numbers @xmath16 denoting the tunneling sequences .",
    "( d)-(f ) show the conventional at through a noninteracting qd .",
    "the wavy arrows represent the emission of phonons during the inelastic tunnelings . ]    for comparison , we also give a general scenario of the conventional phonon - assisted ats for a noninteracting n - qd - s , where the qd without the onsite coulomb interaction favors even electron occupation . in this system , there are two interleaved sets of phonon sidebands , each separated by @xmath10 , in the differential conductance , since additional phonon - emitted inelastic at can be triggered at @xmath17 . for @xmath18 ,",
    "the at is elastic [ see fig.1(d ) for @xmath19 . for @xmath20 , an n - lead electron at @xmath0 can transfer to the s lead through the lower [ fig.1(e ) , @xmath21 or upper [ fig.1(f ) , @xmath22 abs by emitting @xmath23 phonons , while another electron passes directly through the other abs .",
    "similar inelastic ats take place from the s lead to the n lead for @xmath24 .",
    "when the two abss are indistinguishable ( e.g. , their widths being larger than their interval ) or separated by multiples of @xmath10 , the two sets of phonon sidebands merge into a single set of sidebands separated by one phonon energy .",
    "this is exactly the special case discussed in ref.@xcite . in the following ,",
    "we perform a model calculation to demonstrate these transport scenarios .",

    "the last term @xmath33 describes the electronic tunneling between the dot and the leads . from the tunneling matrix elements @xmath34 , the dot level @xmath35 acquires an intrinsic broadening @xmath36 with @xmath37 the density of state of lead n and lead s in normal state . by the standard keldysh nonequilibrium green s function",

    "we focus on the strong epi regime .",
    "it is thus appropriate to make the non - perturbative lang - firsov transformation @xcite @xmath42 with @xmath43 to eliminate the linear epi .",
    "this gives us @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 , with @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 $ ] . here a dimensionless measure of epi @xmath51 is introduced .",
    "as in dealing with the localized polarons , we adopt the approximation replacing the operator @xmath52 with its expectation value @xmath53 $ ] , where the average is taken over the independent phonon bath @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is the bose distribution .",

    "in the numerical results presented below , we take all the renormalized parameters to be freely tunable .",
    "@xmath94 is taken as the energy unit and the temperature is always set at zero .",
    "we consider first the phonon - assisted inelastic at in the kondo regime . to this end",
    ", we adopt the parameters @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 such that the kondo effect and the on - dot paring coexist . in fig.[fig2](a ) , it is shown that remarkable differential conductance peaks , in addition to the zero - bias kondo peak , develop whenever the bias voltage varies by half a phonon energy .",
    "these kondo sidebands are consistent with the scenarios previously discussed in figs.[fig1](a)-(c ) , and are very different from those occurring in n - qd - n systems that are separated by one phonon energy @xcite .",
    "note also that the kondo sidebands at positive bias are much weaker than those at negative bias , which can be ascribed to that the kondo effect is suppressed ( enhanced ) at positive ( negative ) bias since the dot energy level gets away from ( closer to ) the fermi level of lead n. furthermore , as compared with the kondo resonance at zero epi [ see the red dashed curve in fig.[fig2](a ) ] , the zero - bias peak at finite epi is significantly reduced and narrowed .    , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 .",

    "inset shows the corresponding differential conductance . ]    the underlying physics about why the conductance peaks are separated by @xmath11 can be acquired by examining the ldos , since the conductance from the kondo - andreev tunneling processes is roughly proportional to the convolution of electron and hole density of states @xcite .",
    "fig.[fig2](b ) presents the ldos for several bias voltages decreasing in a step of @xmath108 . in equilibrium , multiple kondo satellites ( @xmath109 ) exhibit on each side of the main kondo resonance ( @xmath110 ) due to the epi . in the following ,",
    "we will focus on the nearest two satellites around the main resonance . in nonequilibrium ,",
    "the main resonance and the two kondo satellites all split into two subpeaks , resulting in totally six kondo peaks in the ldos as indicated by @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) , @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) , @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) , @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) , @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) , and @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) in fig.[fig2](b ) .",
    "when the bias is tuned to @xmath12 , the two peaks @xmath111 and @xmath119 , as well as @xmath115 and @xmath117 , merge into a single pronounced resonance ( marked by red circles ) , respectively .",
    "clearly , the convolution of these two merged kondo resonances is larger than the convolution of @xmath111 and @xmath117 at @xmath123 , thereby cooperatively giving rise to a conductance peak at @xmath12 .",
    "similarly , at @xmath124 , the two kondo satellites @xmath115 and @xmath119 get merged at @xmath110 and thus results in a conductance peak . in short words ,",
    "the kondo sidebands always appear in the conductance at the bias voltage @xmath106 under which the ldos exhibits kondo - peak cooperative enhancement within the bias window @xmath125 $ ] .",
    "the cotunneling processes associated with some kondo peaks in the ldos are illustrated in fig.[fig2](c ) .",
    "it is shown that the cotunneling processes of the @xmath126 and @xmath127 kondo peaks are of the second and fourth order , respectively .",
    "this explains why the @xmath128 kondo resonances are stronger than the @xmath127 resonances .",
    "specifically , in the kondo process of @xmath111 , a localized spin-@xmath7 electron tunnels out to lead n , followed closely by a spin-@xmath8 electron at @xmath0 tunneling into the qd . at low temperatures , a coherent superposition of such second - order spin - flip cotunneling events",
    "yields a many - body spin singlet comprising of the localized and n - lead electrons , which manifests itself as the sharp kondo resonance @xmath111 in the ldos .",
    "when @xmath129 as in our case , the at can also take part in the kondo cotunneling process .",
    "for example , in the kondo - andreev process of @xmath117 , the localized spin-@xmath7 electron first tunnels out to @xmath0 and a cooper pair in the s lead splits into two electrons with opposite spins . the split",
    "spin-@xmath8 electron then tunnels into the qd while the other electron transfer through the qd to the empty state with energy @xmath130 in lead n. the coherent superposition of such fourth - order spin - flip cotunneling events leads to the weak kondo resonance @xmath117 in the ldos @xcite .",
    "other kondo peaks such as @xmath113 , @xmath115 , @xmath119 , and @xmath121 are produced by similar kondo and kondo - andreev cotunneling processes but with one phonon being emitted .",
    "the current and conductance as a function of the dot level @xmath105 are further investigated [ fig.[fig2](d ) ] .",
    "as we can see , both quantities change monotonously with @xmath105 .",
    "this is different from those in conventional at regime where characteristic peaks show up whenever the the dot level @xmath105 changes by @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the featureless nature of our @xmath91 vs @xmath105 and @xmath131 vs @xmath105 curves can be readily understood .",
    "as long as @xmath105 is always restricted in the kondo regime , the resulting kondo resonances are robust and no additional phonon - assisted channel could be opened or closed when @xmath105 is varied .    for comparison , we now turn to investigate the conventional inelastic at in a noninteracting ( @xmath132 ) n - qd - s with the qd level @xmath133 fixed at the fermi energy . in this parameter regime , the two abss appear at @xmath5 with @xmath134 . in figs.[fig3](a)-3(c ) , the conductance is displayed for three values of @xmath135 .",
    "different from the conductance behaviors in the kondo regime , there are indeed two sets of phonon sidebands at @xmath136 , each separated by one phonon energy , in agreement with our previous discussions of figs.[fig1](d)-1(f ) . generally , the two sets of sidebands are interleaved [ figs.3(a ) and 3(b ) ] . for @xmath137 [ fig.3(c ) ] , the two sets of sidebands merge with each others .",
    "this corresponds to the @xmath91-@xmath106 staircases addressed previously @xcite .",
    "these conductance behaviors displayed can also be traced back to the ldoss at different bias voltages , as shown in figs.[fig3](d)-3(f ) . at zero bias , only hole - type ( electron - type ) sidebands of the upper ( lower ) abs appear at @xmath138 ( @xmath139 ) , with @xmath20 , which can be attributed to the fact that the upper ( lower ) abs is fully empty ( occupied ) and the phonon absorption is unavailable at zero temperature @xcite . for finite bias larger than @xmath140 ,",
    "the upper abs becomes occupied , therefore phonon sidebands develop on both sides of each abs . upon adjusting @xmath135 such that @xmath141 the sidebands associated with the two abss merge together [ see fig.[fig3](f ) ] .    )",

    "<S> phonon - assisted electronic tunnelings through a vibrating quantum dot embedded between normal and superconducting leads are studied in the kondo regime . </S>",
    "<S> in such a hybrid device , with the bias applied to the normal lead , we find a series of kondo sidebands separated by half a phonon energy in the differential conductance , which are distinct from the phonon - assisted sidebands previously observed in the conventional andreev tunnelings and in systems with only normal leads . </S>",
    "<S> these kondo sidebands originate from the kondo - andreev cooperative cotunneling mediated by phonons , which exhibit a novel kondo transport behavior due to the interplay of the kondo effect , the andreev tunnelings , and the mechanical vibrations . </S>",
