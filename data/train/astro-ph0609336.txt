    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are divided into two broad classes of short / hard and long / soft bursts @xcite , which appear to have different progenitor populations .",
    "observations of type ic supernovae in association with long grbs provide a direct confirmation that they arise from the death of massive stars @xcite .",
    "short grbs , on the other hand , have long been suspected to arise from the merger of neutron star and/or black hole binaries ( ns - ns , ns - bh ; e.g. , @xcite ) . during the last year , follow - up observations of  and  short grbs have provided initial confirmation to this idea , based in particular on the localization of some short grbs to elliptical galaxies @xcite , their lack of association with bright supernovae @xcite , and their lower energy release and wider beaming angles compared to long grbs @xcite .    despite this observational progress",
    "we are still missing a clear understanding of the progenitor population , due to the lack of direct observations ( circumburst chemical abundances , gravitational waves , or a sub - relativistic , radioactive component : @xcite ) .",
    "thus , statistical studies of the burst properties can be highly effective in understanding their progenitor population(s ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite investigated the ratio of short grbs in early- and late - type galaxies as a constraint on the age distribution of the progenitors .",
    "their analysis combines the global star formation rate in each galaxy type with a local galaxy stellar mass function , assuming the formation process of short grb progenitors does not depend on any other physical parameters .",
    "since each galaxy type has experienced a globally different star formation history , the ratio of bursts in each type is predicted to vary as a function of the progenitor age distribution .",
    "a complementary way to constrain the progenitor age distribution is to use the rates of short grbs in clusters and the field ( @xcite ; hereafter paper i ) .",
    "this approach takes advantage of the following differences between cluster and field environment .",
    "first , the galaxy stellar mass function of clusters is more heavily dominated by massive galaxies than in the field @xcite . since the star formation history is mainly determined by galaxy mass ,",
    "the overall growth of stellar mass is in turn affected by the large - scale environment .",
    "second , the fraction of early - type galaxies is larger in clusters than in the field @xcite .",
    "finally , there appears to be a systematic offset in the star formation histories of cluster and field early - type galaxies of @xmath8 gyr ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these effects lead to an overall difference in cluster and field star formation histories , which combined with the progenitor age distribution , is expected to affect the relative fraction of short grbs in each environment .    in this paper",
    "we quantify these effects and show how the ratio of short grbs in cluster and field early - type galaxies can be used to understand the age distribution of the progenitors .",
    "this is part of our on - going systematic study of galaxy clusters hosting short grbs , using multi - slit optical spectroscopy and x - ray observations ( paper i ) .",
    "we find that the current observations , albeit with a small number of events , favor @xmath0 with @xmath6 . finally , we provide a comparison of the systematic effects in this approach and the approach of @xcite .",
    "the approach used by @xcite can be generalized to formulate the short grb rate per unit volume in cluster and field early - type galaxies at @xmath9 , using the star formation history function , @xmath10 instead of a star formation rate function : @xmath11 here @xmath12 is both the look - back time and the time delay of a short grb progenitor , and @xmath13 designates a cluster or field environment .",
    "@xmath14 represents the time delay probability distribution of the progenitors with a normalization constant @xmath15 . in the context of ns - ns or ns - bh mergers",
    "we adopt the standard power - law form , @xmath16 .",
    "we note that ns - ns binaries in the milky way appear to follow @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "it is thus the convolution of @xmath14 with @xmath18 that determines the relative rate of short grbs in cluster and field early - type galaxies .",
    "since the star formation history of early - type galaxies is determined by both the mass and environment of a galaxy , the total star formation history of each environment can be described in the following manner : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the galaxy number density function , @xmath21 is the star formation history function of a single galaxy that has a stellar mass , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the appropriate upper and lower mass integration limits ( see  [ sec : apply ] ) .    from sdss observations , it has been determined that the galaxy number density is well described by a double schechter function @xcite : @xmath25\\frac{dm}{m^ * } , \\label{eqn : phi}\\ ] ] where the parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 for a cluster environment ( @xmath31 ) are 11.06 , 0.74 , @xmath32 , 0.07 , and @xmath33 , and for a field environment ( @xmath34 ) they are 10.44 , 2.7 , @xmath35 , 0.8 , and @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath36 is the projected density of neighboring galaxies , and the specific values are determined from a sample of @xmath37 galaxies in the redshift range @xmath38 in the sdss data release four @xcite .",
    "we are here only interested in the rates of short grbs in early - type galaxies , whose star formation history is better understood than those of late - type galaxies , and in order to avoid any systematic differences between progenitors in late- and early - type host galaxies .",
    "we therefore need to modify @xmath39 by the fraction of early - type galaxies in each environment @xcite : @xmath40\\ } , \\label{eqn : fri}\\ ] ] where the values of the parameters @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are @xmath45 mpc@xmath46 , 0.69 , @xmath47 m@xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "thus , @xmath50 . in a cluster environment , with a higher @xmath36 and systematically larger masses , the early - type fraction is larger than in the field .",
    "a plot of @xmath51 for cluster and field environments is shown in figure  [ fig : panels]a .",
    "clearly , the most massive galaxies reside preferentially in clusters , while the bulk of the mass in galaxies with @xmath52 is in the field .",
    "finally , we turn to the star formation history function , @xmath53 .",
    "early - type galaxies in different environments show different star formation histories for a given galaxy mass @xcite .",
    "moreover , the star formation history is also determined by the galaxy mass .",
    "following @xcite , we use a gaussian form for the star formation history : @xmath54 , \\label{eqn : sfhgal}\\ ] ] where the peak of the star formation history function , @xmath55 , is determined by both the mass of a galaxy and its environment ( equations 2 and 3 of @xcite ) , and @xmath56 is determined by the mass of a galaxy . here",
    ", we assume that the low - density environment of @xcite corresponds to the field , while clusters correspond to the high - density environment .",
    "the overall trend is that less massive galaxies form their stars later ( i.e. , smaller @xmath55 ) and over a wider timescale ( i.e. , larger @xmath56 ) .",
    "in addition , @xmath55 in clusters is systematically larger than in the field .",
    "these effects are shown in figure  [ fig : panels]b , where we plot the star formation histories of galaxies with @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 m@xmath48 in both environments .",
    "the final ingredient is the overall normalization of equation  [ eqn : phi ] . in its current form",
    "this equation was normalized to a total mass of @xmath59 m@xmath48 for each environment by @xcite .",
    "since we are interested in the overall rate per unit volume , we therefore need to know what fraction of the stellar mass is in clusters versus the field at @xmath9 . from the study of @xcite , as well as @xcite and @xcite",
    ", it appears that about @xmath61 of the total stellar mass is included in cluster environments , which we adopt here .",
    "to illustrate the combined effect of the trends discussed in the previous section we begin by making the simplified assumption that there is a single typical galaxy mass , @xmath62 , for each environment .",
    "this typical mass in turn determines the typical star formation history of each environment . in this scenario ,",
    "equation  [ eqn : sfh ] can be simplified as : @xmath63 while @xmath62 is determined by @xcite : @xmath64 therefore , @xmath62 is @xmath65 m@xmath48 and @xmath66 m@xmath48 for field and cluster environments , respectively .",
    "we are now in a position to use equations  [ eqn : rate ] , [ eqn : phi ] , [ eqn : fri ] , [ eqn : sfhgal ] , and [ eqn : sfhsimple ] to predict the relative rate of short grbs in cluster and field early - type galaxies .",
    "the result as a function of the power law index @xmath67 is shown in figure  [ fig : simple ] .",
    "we note that the absolute scale in this plot is irrelevant since we did not integrate over the full mass function , but it provides insight into the overall trend .",
    "namely , as @xmath67 increases , i.e. , as the distribution is more heavily weighted to older progenitors , the fraction of short grbs in clusters increases .",
    "this can be understood as the combined effect of a systematically earlier star formation episode and a higher typical mass in clusters .",
    "a quantitative determination of the relative rates requires a full integration of equation  [ eqn : sfh ] .",
    "the results of this integration are shown in figure  [ fig : full ] .",
    "overall , the dependence of the ratio of short grbs in clusters and the field on @xmath67 is similar to the one found in the simple case .",
    "however , the integration over the full mass function of each environment brings out additional trends . for a low mass cutoff smaller than @xmath59 m@xmath48",
    ", there is sharp downturn in the ratio for @xmath68 .",
    "this can be understood from the plots of @xmath69 shown in figures  [ fig : panels]c and [ fig : panels]d .",
    "in particular , for @xmath2 the short grb rate in the field is larger than in clusters since the field has a higher abundance of low mass ( @xmath70 m@xmath48 ) early - type galaxies ( figure  [ fig : panels]a ) , which have young or intermediate stellar populations . for such low values of @xmath67",
    "the ratio is sensitive primarily to recent star formation .",
    "we note that the same effect is seen in the analysis of @xcite for the ratio of early- to late - type hosts .    in this context ( @xmath68 )",
    "the lower mass cutoff in equation  [ eqn : sfh ] plays an important role . in figure",
    "[ fig : full ] we show the effect of setting @xmath71 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 m@xmath48 .",
    "as noted above , for @xmath72 m@xmath48 we do not see an obvious downturn because galaxies above this limit do not exhibit any obvious recent star formation activity . for the lower values of @xmath24",
    ", we find that the largest downturn is for @xmath73 m@xmath48 .",
    "the reason for this is evident in figure  [ fig : panels]a , which shows that the largest difference between the field and cluster mass functions is at @xmath74 m@xmath48 . at lower masses",
    "the mass functions converge , leading to a ratio that is @xmath75 .    for @xmath76 ,",
    "on the other hand , the rate is dominated by the oldest , and hence most massive galaxies ( figure  [ fig : panels]d ) . in this case the ratio does not depend on @xmath24 , and the predominance of massive galaxies in clusters , along with the systematically earlier star formation episodes , results in an increased fraction of short grbs in clusters for larger @xmath67 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath4 , we find that there are three times as many short grbs in cluster early - type galaxies as there are in field early - type galaxies .",
    "we now turn to a comparison of our model with observation of short grbs . to date two short bursts",
    "have been localized to clusters at @xmath77 : grb050509b @xcite and grb050911 ( paper1 ) .",
    "we note that in the latter case the large error circle prevents an association with a specific cluster galaxy , but the large early - type fraction of @xmath78 @xcite suggests that the burst was likely hosted by an early - type galaxy . on the other hand",
    ", only one short grb has been localized to a field early - type galaxy , grb050724 @xcite .",
    "we do not consider grb050813 , which was hosted by a cluster at a much higher redshift ( @xmath79 ; @xcite ) , and grb060502b , which may be hosted by an early - type galaxy @xcite , but whose large - scale environment has not been fully explored yet .",
    "thus , the current ratio of short grbs in cluster versus field early - type galaxies is about @xmath80 , with a large uncertainty due to the small number of events . from figure",
    "[ fig : full ] , we find that this ratio corresponds to @xmath81 .",
    "this value is lower than @xmath82 claimed by @xcite , but is in rough agreement with @xmath83 found by @xcite based on their revised redshift distribution with @xmath84 of all short grbs at @xmath85 .    clearly , in both methods of estimating the age of short grb progenitors the uncertainty in the inferred value of @xmath67 is currently dominated by the small number of bursts with a known redshift , host galaxy , and large - scale environment type . since this uncertainty will eventually diminish with a larger sample of events , it is interesting to consider systematic uncertainties in both theoretical approaches .",
    "our analysis suffers from the somewhat poor definition of cluster and field environments .",
    "we have used an overall cluster mass fraction of @xmath61 , as indicated by several researchers , but this number may range from @xmath86 to @xmath87 .",
    "second , we have used the simplified bimodal star formation history model of @xcite , but these authors do not use the same quantitative definition of galaxy environment that was used for the mass functions by @xcite . since we have used representative mass functions , and then scaled the results by the overall mass fraction in clusters and the field , this effect should not be significant .",
    "third , the uncertainty in the definition of field galaxy environment leads to an overall uncertainty of about @xmath61 in our calculated ratio . finally , since for @xmath68 the ratio depends on @xmath24 , it is essential to understand the appropriate low mass limit for early - type galaxies . with the current inferred value of @xmath6 ,",
    "however , this may not be a relevant issue for short grbs .",
    "similarly , the analysis of the short grb rate in early- and late - type galaxies performed by @xcite also suffers from systematic effects .",
    "first , the ratio is affected by the uncertain star formation history at high redshift when early - type galaxies formed most of their stars .",
    "second , their estimation of star formation rate does not consider environmental effects that appear to be important in current observations from sdss and 2df , and which we have accounted for here . finally ,",
    "as noted by @xcite , it is possible that late - type galaxies have an altogether different age distribution of short grb progenitors than early - type galaxies .",
    "this problem is overcome by our method since it considers only early - type host galaxies .",
    "we note that if both derivations are in fact correct , then the estimated values of @xmath67 can be used to assess any systematic differences of short grb progenitors in early- and late - type galaxies , as suspected to exist for type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "future applications of our approach will include the effect of globular clusters , which are thought to provide an efficient environment for the production of ns - ns binaries , and may account for a substantial fraction of all short grb progenitors @xcite .",
    "we expect that since the specific frequency of globular clusters increases significantly with galaxy mass @xcite , an association with globular clusters will increase the fraction of short grbs in galaxy clusters compared to the trend shown in figure  [ fig : full ] .",
    "similarly , our approach can be extended to higher redshift to investigate the evolution in the fraction of short grbs in clusters .",
    "we expect that the lack of strong evolution in the last several gyr likely makes our analysis applicable out to @xmath88 .",
    "however , if some short grbs are in fact associated with clusters at @xmath89 , this presents an opportunity to assess any systematic changes in the value of @xmath67 with redshift .",
    "we end with the following conclusion .",
    "if our current estimate of @xmath90 continues to be supported by future observations , then this implies that the majority of short grbs in early - type galaxies will occur in clusters .",
    "this therefore suggests that short grbs can provide an efficient tool for finding forming galaxy clusters at high redshift , as already appears to be the case for grb050813 @xcite .",
    "continued near - ir imaging and optical spectroscopic observations of short grb fields may therefore provide an efficient method for finding the highest redshift clusters .",
