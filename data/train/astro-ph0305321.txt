    "the discovery in a relatively nearby galaxy of a type  ia supernova ( sn  ia ) , more than a week before its time of maximum brightness , presents an observational opportunity that should not be missed . a few days after the discovery of sn 1998aq in ngc 3982 on 1998 april 13 by the u.k . supernova / nova patrol ( hurst , armstrong , & arbour 1998 ) , photometric and spectroscopic observations undertaken at the f.  l.  whipple observatory ( flwo ) revealed that the supernova was a type  ia whose brightness was on the rise ( garnavich et  al .",
    "subsequent observations resulted in sn  1998aq becoming one of the best observed sne  ia at optical wavelengths .",
    "the _ hubble space telescope _ has been used by saha et  al ( 2001 ; see also stetson & gibson 2001 ) to make a cepheid  based determination of the distance to ngc  3982 , so that sn  1998aq can be added to the list of sne  ia that are used to calibrate the extragalactic distance scale .    a preliminary report of the photometric observations of sn  1998aq has been given by boffi & riess ( 2003 ) , and the final results will appear elsewhere ( a.  g.  riess et  al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "sn  1998aq reached a maximum brightness of @xmath0=12.39 on 1998 april  27 .",
    "the value of @xmath1 , the decline of the blue  band magnitude during the first 15 days after maximum ( phillips 1993 ) , was 1.14 , a typical value for a normal sn  ia .",
    "sn  1998aq was photometrically normal , except that some of its broad  band colors were unusually blue , e.g. , @xmath2=@xmath30.18 at the time of @xmath0 maximum .",
    "low  dispersion spectra of sn  1998aq were obtained with the fast spectrograph ( fabricant et  al .",
    "1998 ) on the 1.5-m tillinghast telescope at flwo .",
    "the fast spectrograph uses a 2688@xmath4512 loral ccd with a spatial scale of 1.@xmath51 per pixel in the binning mode used for these observations .",
    "details of the exposures are given in table  1 .",
    "the data were reduced in the standard manner with iraf and our own routines .",
    "the spectra were optimally extracted ( horne 1986 ) .",
    "wavelength calibration was accomplished with henear lamps taken immediately after each sn exposure .",
    "small  scale adjustments derived from night  sky lines in the sn frames were also applied .",
    "spectrophotometric standards are listed in table  1 .",
    "we attempted to remove telluric lines using the well  exposed continua of the spectrophotometric standards ( wade & horne 1988 ; matheson et  al .",
    "the spectra were , in general , not taken at the parallactic angle ( filippenko 1982 ) .",
    "for the spectra modeled in this paper , though , the airmass was low ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the spectra , labelled by the epoch in days with respect to the date of maximum brightness in the @xmath0 band ( 1998 april  27 ) , are displayed in figs . 1 - 3 .",
    "the spectra are those of a normal sn  ia .",
    "the early spectra , from @xmath7 to 7 days ( fig .  1 ) , contain the characteristic deep si  ii absorption near 6100    and the distinctive s  ii w  shaped feature from about 5200 to 5500   .",
    "the spectra between 19 and 91 days ( figs .  2 and 3 ) are those of a sn  ia making the transformation from the photospheric to the nebular phase .",

    "the similarity of the spectra at @xmath8 days ( fig .",
    "4 ) is impressive , considering that pre ",
    "maximum spectra of sne  ia exhibit considerable diversity ( e.g. , hatano et  al . 2000 ; li et  al .",
    "2001 ) . at @xmath8 days",
    "the main difference is that sn  1998aq has a peak near 4600    that is not present in sn  1994d ; otherwise practically all of the features , including the weak ones , are quite similar . at 4 , 19 , and 54/55 days the spectra also are similar , although they are distinguishable , e.g. , near 4100    at 4 days and near 5400    at 19 and 54/55 days .    in fig .",
    "6 the blueshifts , expressed in , of the absorption near 6100    produced by si  ii 6355 in the early spectra of sne  1998aq and 1994d are compared .",
    "except at the earliest times , when the blueshift is changing rapidly with time and that of sn  1994d is mildly higher than that of sn  1998aq , the differences are within the measurement errors of about 250 .",

    "the blueshifts of the deep ca  ii and si  ii absorptions remain near 10,000  even at 35 days , but those of the weaker si  iii and s  ii features decrease more rapidly .    from fig .",

    "our measured values put sn  1998aq in the most heavily populated part of their plot , near , e.g. , sne  1994d , 1996x , 1998bu , and 1990n .",
    "garnavich et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) have shown that there is a tight relation between @xmath10 [ referred to as @xmath14 by garnavich et  al . ] and @xmath1 .",

    "obtained within three days of maximum light , but for sn  1998aq their adopted date of maximum differed from the date later reported by boffi & riess ( 2003 ) . with our recommended value of @xmath10 , based on specta",
    "obtained within three days of the revised date of maximum , sn  1998aq fits the garnavich et  al .",
    "relation between @xmath10 and @xmath15 even better .",
    "the analysis of supernova spectra begins with the often difficult process of making line identifications .",
    "only a limited number of good sn  ia spectra have been obtained well before the time of maximum light , so we are especially interested in exploring line identifications in the earliest spectrum of sn  1998aq , at @xmath7 days . for comparison",
    "we also will look at the 0 and 7  day spectra .",
    "these three spectra are compared in fig .",
    "the overall appearance of these spectra is rather similar , although some significant changes do occur during this time interval :",
    "the si  ii , s  ii , and ca  ii absorptions become deeper with time ; the absorption trough from 4800 to 5000  in the @xmath7  day spectrum breaks up in the 7  day spectrum ; and the absorption trough from 4200 to 4500    in the 7  day spectrum is more broken up in the @xmath7  day spectrum .",
    "we have studied line identifications by comparing the three spectra of fig .",
    "8 with numerous synthetic spectra generated with the parameterized supernova synthetic  spectrum code * synow*. this code has been used and described in several recent papers , e.g. , branch et  al .",
    "the basic assumptions are spherical symmetry , a sharp photosphere , velocity proportional to radius , and resonance scattering in the sobolev approximation .",
    "the shape of the underlying continuum is that of a blackbody at temperature @xmath16 .",
    "line optical depths are taken to vary as @xmath17 , with @xmath18=1000  for all synthetic spectra shown in this paper .",
    "for each ion whose lines are introduced , the maximum sobolev optical depth of a reference line is a fitting parameter . ordinarily , the maximum line optical depth is at the photosphere , but for a `` detached '' ion the line optical depth is zero at the photosphere and rises discontinuously to its maximum value at some higher detachment velocity .",
    "the optical depths of the other lines of an ion , relative to that of the reference line , are calculated for boltzmann excitation at temperature @xmath19 . in this paper , instead of adopting a common value of the excitation temperature @xmath19 as the default value , the default value for each ion is the temperature at which the ion s reference  line optical depth reaches a maximum in plots of optical depth versus temperature ( hatano et  al . 1999b ) .",
    "this is a reasonable default since , e.g. , if lines of high excitation are present they are likely to be formed in high temperature layers .",
    "the default excitation temperatures are used throughout this paper except in one instance that is mentioned below .      the @xmath7 day spectrum is shown in fig .",

    "all subsequent figures of this paper , instead of plotting @xmath20 on the vertical axis we plot @xmath21 , to make the spectrum approximately flat .",
    "this provides a better view of features at the longer wavelengths where the underlying continuum is low , which is helpful because the diagnostic value of a spectral feature is not proportional to the level of the underlying continuum .",
    "note also that in order to show as much detail as possible , in this and subsequent figures the flux axis does not go to zero .    in fig .",

    "the contributions of each ion to the synthetic spectrum of fig .  10 are shown in figs .",

    "the identification of lines of si  ii , s  ii , ca  ii , fe  iii , and si  iii in early spectra of sne  ia is not new , but the figures of this paper clearly illustrate the extent to which lines of these ions can account , with simple assumptions , for the observed spectral features in sn  1998aq .",
