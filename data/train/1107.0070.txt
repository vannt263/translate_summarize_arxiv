    "mcg2 - 58 - 22  is an x - ray bright seyfert 1.5 active galactic nucleus ( agn ) located at a redshift of @xmath10 = 0.04686 .",
    "past x - ray observations of this source performed with _ exosat _ , _ asca _ , _ xmm - newton_and _ bepposax_have revealed the following spectral components in addition to the primary x - ray power law : a soft excess , fe emission lines , and a compton reflection hump .",
    "importantly , there has been no evidence for x - ray absorption by gas along the line of sight in excess of the galactic column , indicating that in the x - ray band this agn is a `` bare nucleus '' .",
    "this combination makes mcg2 - 58 - 22  an interesting target of study , since the lack of significant x - ray absorption provides a clean view of the nucleus with a relatively simple spectum to model , while the presence of strong reflection components allows us to place constraints on the physical geometry of the circumnuclear material surrounding the agn .",
    "ghosh & soundararajaperumal ( 1992 ) analyzed _ exosat _ data obtained in 1984 that revealed the highly variable soft excess below about 2 kev .",
    "they modeled this component with a steep power law in addition to their continuum power law .",
    "_ asca _ data covering 2.510 kev with good ccd resolution were analyzed by weaver et al.(1995 ) .",
    "they modeled the spectrum using a hard x - ray power law ( @xmath11 ) with galactic absorption and confirmed the need for a soft excess , as well as an fe k@xmath12  emission line which was unresolved .",
    "weaver , gelbord & yaqoob ( 2001 ) analyzed two additional _ asca _ observations of mcg2 - 58 - 22 , tracking the fe line flux over a time scale of years and showing large variation in the flux of the underlying continuum .",
    "however large uncertainties precluded definitive conclusions about the variation of the fe line parameters .    a more recent analysis by bianchi et al.(2004 ) using simultaneous data from _ xmm - newton_and _ bepposax _ covered a much broader energy range than previous observations ( 0.5200 kev ) .",
    "unfortunately only 7 ks of good epic - pn data were obtained for the source , providing only loose constraints in the fe k bandpass ( the fe k@xmath12  line was unresolved with @xmath13 ev and an equivalent width , ew , of 45@xmath14 ev ) .",
    "they were able to loosely constrain the compton reflection hump with @xmath15 and @xmath16@xmath17 .",
    "in this paper we present an in - depth analysis of a single 140 ks long - look _ suzaku_observation of mcg2 - 58 - 22 .",
    "_ suzaku_is a japanese observatory that provides broadband x - ray spectra from @xmath180.5 kev to above 500 kev with good energy resolution and effective area around 57 kev for detailed analysis of the fe k complex ( mitsuda et al.2007 ) .",
    "our goals for this observation were to study the fe k emission , constrain the compton hump , confirm the bare nucleus , and study the soft excess , all of which _",
    "suzaku_is capable of doing well .",
    "this information can then be used to explore possibilities for the geometry of the circumnuclear material including the fe line emitting gas and we improve upon parameter values in the literature for the compton hump and fe k emission lines .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : section 2 details data reduction , section 3 describes spectral fitting and analysis , and section 4 contains a discussion of the results .",
    "_ suzaku _ observed mcg2 - 58 - 22  with the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ; koyama et al.2007 ) and the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ; takahashi et al.2007 ) on 2009 november 27 beginning at 22:49 ut ( observation i d 704032010 ) .",
    "data were processed with version 2.4.12.27 of the _ suzaku _ pipeline and typical screening criteria were applied ( as per the _ suzaku _ data reduction guide ) .",
    "all extractions were done using heasoft v.6.9 .",
    "the xis is comprised of 3 ccd cameras each placed in the focal plan of an x - ray telescope module .",
    "two of these ( xis0 and xis3 ) are front - illuminated ( fi ) , maximizing the effective area of the detectors in the fe k bandpass , while the third ( xis1 ) is back - illuminated ( bi ) , increasing its effective area in the soft x - ray band ( @xmath192 kev ) .",
    "two corners of each xis ccd are illuminated by an @xmath20fe calibration source , which can be used to calibrate the gain and test the spectral resolution of data taken using this instrument ( see the _ suzaku _ data reduction guide for details ) .    after screening ,",
    "the good exposure time per xis was 138.9  ks .",
    "the xis events data were in 3@xmath213 and 5@xmath215 editing modes which were cleaned and summed to create image files for each xis . from these we extracted source and background lightcurves and spectra , using xisrmfgen and xissimarfgen to create the response matrix ( rmf ) and ancillary response ( arf ) files .",
    "data from the two front - illuminated ccds were summed to create a single co - added fi spectrum after it was confirmed that the two spectra were consistent .",
    "data were ignored above 12 kev ( 10 kev for bi ) where the effective area of the xis begins to drop dramatically .",
    "data were ignored below 1.0 kev ( 0.7 for bi which has a larger effective area at low energies ) due to time - dependent calibration issues of the instumental o k edge at 0.5 kev , and between 1.5 and 2.4 kev due to large calibration uncertainties for the si k complex and au m edge arising from the detector mirror system .",
    "these issues are not fully understood at the time of this writing .",
    "average 210 kev rates were 1.410@xmath22 and 1.521@xmath23 countss@xmath5 per xis for fi and bi respectively .",

    "fitting the @xmath20fe calibration source spectra in xspec v.12.6.0 ( arnaud et al.1996 ) with a model comprised of three gaussian components ( mn k@xmath24 , k@xmath25 and k@xmath26 ) yielded the following results for the mn k@xmath24 line energy ( expected value of 5.899 kev ) : 5.886 kev ( fi ) and 5.890 ( bi ) , showing that the energy calibration has a systematic untertainty of @xmath1810 ev for both the fi the bi . additionally , these lines had an average width of 30 ev , which we will take as instrumental broadening in excess of that modeled by the response matrix , and have subtracted this value in quadrature from all measured line widths .",
    "the hxd gathered data with both its detectors , the pin diodes and the gso scintillators , however we did not use the gso data because of the faintness of the source relative to the non - x - ray background in the gso band .",
    "the hxd / pin is a non - imaging instrument with a 34@xmath27 square ( fwhm ) field of view .",
    "the hxd instrument team provides non - x - ray background model event files using the calibrated gso data for the particle background monitor ( `` background d '' or `` tuned background '' with method = lcfitdt ) .",

    "we used data from 4.58.5 kev from the fi spectrum only because of its excellent response and effective area in this energy range .",
    "we analyzed the fe k complex , including the fe k@xmath12  and k@xmath26  lines and the fe k edge , and investigated the possiblity of emission from ionized fe , namely fe xxv or xxvi ( the latter was reported by bianchi et al.2004 with a 2@xmath28 detection ) .",
    "as a first step we fit a simple power law with galactic absorption . model ",
    "data residuals for the simple power law are shown in figure [ figfek ] .",
    "this yielded a poor fit with @xmath59dof= 322/100 and obvious residuals around 6.4 kev ( rest frame energy ) , the location of the fe k@xmath12  line . fitting",
    "the line with a gaussian component provided a much better fit with @xmath59dof= 117/97 .",
    "visual inspection then revealed additional residuals around 7.1 kev ( the location of the k@xmath26  line and fe k edge ) .",
    "we then added an edge component to model additional fe k shell absorption in excess of the galactic column and/or the fe k edge associated with compton reflection .",
    "we fixed the edge energy at 7.11 kev and left the optical depth ( @xmath34 ) free . @xmath59dofdropped to 108/96 , indicating a significant detection of the edge at a confidence level of @xmath1899.4% according to an @xmath60-test .- test is inappropriate to perform in this case ( see protassov et al.2002 ) , however it can give a rough approximation of the significance . ]",
    "assuming an origin in neutral or lowly - ionized gas , an fe k@xmath26  line should be present in addition to the fe k@xmath12  line .",
    "we added a gaussian emission line with its energy centroid frozen at 7.056 kev ( degeneracy with the fe k edge at 7.11 kev and lack of sufficient line strength to provide good constraints led to our freezing the parameter at its expected value ) , its width tied to that of the k@xmath12  line and its normalization left free .",
    "the fit improved , with @xmath59dofdropping to 103/95 with a normalization of 15@xmath112% of the k@xmath12  normalization , consistent with that expected for cold / neutral gas .",
    "an @xmath60-test@xmath61 indicates that this is a 2@xmath28 detection at the @xmath1896.4% confidence level .    in some agn , contributions to the total observed fe",
    "k emission profile can arise from material which is ionized , either by collisional- or photo - ionization . using _",
    "xmm - newton_-epic data , bianchi et al.(2004 ) found a degeneracy between the parameters of the k@xmath26  line and those from a possible fe xxvi emission line .",
    "they reported a 2@xmath28 detection of the fe xxvi line when the k@xmath26  line was not included and with all the parameters of the line left free . when we allowed the energy of the k@xmath26  line to be free to vary we found an energy centroid of 7.0@xmath62 , consistent with both the k@xmath26  and fe xxvi line energies .",
    "@xmath59dofwas 102/95 ( not a significant improvement ) and the normalization was 18@xmath114% of the k@xmath12  normalization .",
    "freezing the line energy at 6.966 kev , the weighted average of the fe xxvi doublet , provided a fit virtually identical to the one presented above . fitting both lines simultaneously with energies frozen at their expected values and widths tied to that of the k@xmath12  line gave @xmath59dof=102/94 with a normalization of 13@xmath63% for fe xxvi and an upper limit of 26% for k@xmath26  ( both percentages are with respect to the k@xmath12  normalization ) .",
    "we therefore can not rule out the that the source may contain both emission lines and that we are simply unable to deblend them . for simplicity ,",
    "in all further models described in this paper we have included only the k@xmath26  line with frozen or tied parameters .",
    "we also tested for the presence of fe xxv ( using a gaussian component with energy centroid fixed at 6.70 kev ) , however @xmath59dofdid not improve and only an upper limit to the normalization was obtained ( @xmath196@xmath64 ph@xmath9s@xmath5 ) .",
    "final parameters for the fe k complex model fit including the k@xmath12  line , fe k edge and k@xmath26  line are listed in table 1 as the `` fe k band '' model , including the fe k@xmath12  energy centroid ( @xmath3 ) , intensity ( @xmath33 ) , width ( @xmath28 ) , and ew .",
    "we also tested the `` diskline '' model for the emission lines in place of the more phenomenological gaussian model .",
    "diskline models the doppler broadening of an emission line associated with the inner region of an accretion disk ( fabian et al.1989 ) .",
    "the diskline parameters were not well constrained , giving a very large inner radius ( r@xmath6520 @xmath66 , where @xmath66 is the schwarzchild radius ) and a narrow profile .",
    "it did not improve the fit over a simple gaussian .",
    "next we tried the addition of a broad diskline ( r@xmath67 constrained to around 3 @xmath66 and energy fixed at 6.4 kev ) to a narrow gaussian line with energy and width fixed at the values found with the gaussian fit ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we obtained an upper limit to the diskline normalization of @xmath192@xmath68 ph@xmath9s@xmath5 and an ew of @xmath1935 ev .",
    "it is thus possible that a weak broad line exists in this source and that we are simply unable to detect it ; however combining the weakness of this feature with the lack of ionized emission indicates that most if not all of the fe line flux comes from material that is not close in to the central black hole .",
    "it is possible that such a weak broad line would be degenerate with the compton shoulder , a feature which could arise if there is a significant amount of compton - thick material .",
    "additionally , by visual inspection we see a shallow shelf - like shape in the residuals on the low - energy side of the emission line when @xmath28 is set to @xmath1930 ev .",
    "we tested this by modeling a moderately broad gaussian in addition to the narrow fe k@xmath12  line in the `` fe k band 2 '' model with an energy centroid fixed at 6.34 kev ( matt 2002 ) .",
    "this resulted in an improvement in @xmath59dof of only 2/1 , which is not a significant detection but indicates that the compton shoulder should be tested for in future observations .",
    "next we fit the broadband spectrum of mcg2 - 58 - 22  covering the range from 0.760 kev .",
    "we used the xis fi , xis bi , and pin spectra .",
    "we included an instrumental cross - normalization constant in our fits with the pin constant set to 1.16 ( this is the expected value for xis - nominal pointing and leaving the parameter free caused degeneracy with the compton reflection component in our models ) and the bi constant left free relative to the fi spectrum ( values were typically around @xmath181.05 ) .",
    "the broadband data are shown in figure [ figspec]a .",
    "figure [ figspec]b shows residuals to a simple power law fit in which we can clearly see the need for modeling the fe k complex , compton reflection peaking around 2030 kev , and a soft excess below @xmath181 kev .",
    "we began by modeling the soft excess with a simple power law in addition to the continuum power law and modeling the compton reflection hump using pexrav(magdziarz & zdziarski , 1995 ) which assumes a disk - like geometry for the reflecting material and where the value of @xmath2 is the proportion of the primary power law that is reflected off compton - thick material .",
    "best fit parameters for this model are listed under `` broadband 1 '' in table 1 and data  model residuals are shown in figure [ figspec]c .",
    "we did not find the need for additional cold absorption with an upper limit to the column density of 2.5@xmath30 @xmath9 in excess of the galactic .",
    "we also tested for the presence of warm absorption using an xstar table but found it unnecessary for a good fit .",
    "the compton reflection hump and fe k edge were well fit by the pexravmodel and fe line parameters were very similar to those found from narrow band fitting , including the upper limit to a relativistically broadened diskline component . the observed 210 kev flux was f@xmath69=5.0 @xmath70 ergs@xmath9s@xmath5 and the intrinsic luminosity , calculated using the cosmology - corrected luminosity distance given by the nasa / ipac extragalactic database , and correcting for galactic absorption was l@xmath69=2.30@xmath71 ergss@xmath5 .",
    "figure [ figltlc ] shows historical values of the flux of this source in the 210 kev range .",
    "we also tried a ( phenomenological ) blackbody emission component to model the soft excess .",
    "parameters are listed in table 1 under `` broadband 2 '' .",
    "both the blackbody and power law models fit the data reasonably well , but in both cases parameters were difficult to constrain due to calibration issues with the o k edge below about 1 kev . for simplicity",
    "we adopt broadband 1 as our best - fit model for the discussion in section 4 .",
    "bianchi et al.(2004 ) tested for high energy cut offs in their sample finding model - dependent values of @xmath72 200 kev with error bars of 50800 kev . extending up to only 60 kev , our data are not highly sensitive to a high energy cut off or rollover . utilizing the `` cutoffpl '' model in xspec we found a lower limit to the rollover energy of 500 kev .",

    "self - consistent models should be able to simultaneously model absorption and reflection by circumnuclear material , combining the fe line , compton reflection hump and column density along the line of sight .",
    "we have applied the model `` mytorus '' ( murphy & yaqoob 2009 ) to our spectrum of mcg2 - 58 - 22  which assumes the circumnuclear material is a donut shape of uniform density and includes all three of the components listed above .",
    "the mytorusmodel was derived from monte carlo simulations of a dusty torus of uniform density surrounding an illuminating supermassive black hole .",
    "relevant parameters to the model include the following : @xmath74 , the column density of the material in the torus ( not necessarily in the line of sight ) ; @xmath82 , the inclination angle of the torus , with 0@xmath83 corresponding to a face - on view , 90@xmath83 corresponding to edge - on , and with the torus intersecting the line of sight for angles larger than 60@xmath83 ( the assumed half - opening angle ) ; the photon index ( @xmath0 ) and the normalization ( @xmath73 ) of the illuminating power law ; the width ( @xmath28 ) of the fe k@xmath12  line ( the material is assumed to be cold and the energy is not a free parameter ) ; and with additional parameters @xmath84 and @xmath75 , the normalization factors of the compton hump and fe line respectively , to be used when the amount observed for either is significantly different from that expected by the model due to differences in covering factors , abundances , etc .",
    ", from those assumed .",
    "we also included an additional power law for the soft excess .",
    "we found a reasonably good fit ( @xmath59dof= 623/465 , very similar to the broadband fit @xmath85 values given in table 1 ) with @xmath86 fixed at 30@xmath83 ( there was no significant improvement in fit with this parameter free ) . since there is no extra absorption in mcg2 - 58 - 22 , the value obtained for @xmath74  is driven primarily by the strength of the compton reflection hump and fe line . when @xmath75 was free to vary there was an improvement in @xmath85 of 9 for 1 less degree of freedom .",
    "we obtained a value for @xmath75 0f 0.75@xmath78 , that is the amount of material creating the fe line was about 75% of that creating the compton hump , possibly due to an underabundance of fe or geometrical effects not taken into account by the model ( it should also be noted that the upper uncertainty on @xmath75 is consistent with the lower uncertainty on @xmath74 ) . testing for an additional relativistically broadened fe line yielded an upper limit to the normalization of @xmath191.5@xmath68 ph@xmath9s@xmath5 and an ew of @xmath1930 ev .",
    "our best fit parameters are listed in table [ tabmyt ] and data  model residuals are shown in figure [ figspec]d .",
    "focusing on the fe k band we found the need for both fe k@xmath12  and k@xmath26  emission lines as well as an fe k shell absorption edge ( in broadband fits this edge was modeled sufficiently by the edge associated with the compton reflection hump in both pexravand mytorus ) . from the value of the emission line width found in our best - fit broadband model we calculated the velocity full width at half maximum ( @xmath87 ) of the emitting material to be @xmath797100 kms@xmath5 .",

    "we also tested for a broad line and compton shoulder . according to de la calle prez et al.(2010 ) ,",
    "roughly @xmath901.5@xmath91 counts in the 210 kev band at ccd resolution provide good enough statistical quality to significantly detect a broad line . in the combined fi xis we have @xmath184@xmath91 counts , and",
    "our upper limit on the ew of a broad line places us in the lower part of the ew range of detected broad lines in the fero sample of seyferts observed with _",
    "xmm - newton _ , wherein significant detections of broad lines with ew s in the range of 50250 ev were reported .",
    "we conclude that a very strong broad line ( @xmath9050 ev ) does not exist in mcg2 - 58 - 22 or else our observation would have been sufficient to significantly detect it ; if there does exist a broad line in this source , then it must be very weak .",
    "we would expect to see a compton shoulder given the presence of compton - thick material , however we did not obtain a significant detection .",
    "it should also be noted that the compton shoulder is included in the mytorusmodel automatically , based on the strength of the fe line and the column density of the torus .",
    "this source also shows a very prominent compton hump around 2030 kev ( see figure [ figspec]b ) .",
    "this feature , arising from compton scattering of high energy photons off compton thick material in the vicinity of the black hole , is often associated with the fe line emission seen in agn , since the same compton thick material that produces the compton hump also produces fe k emission . by knowing the ( model - dependent ) relationship between the strength of the compton hump ( @xmath2 ) and the expected fe line ew",
    ", we can test if compton thick gas is capable of accounting for the entire observed fe line flux .",
    "based on calculations done by george and fabian ( 1991 ) for a disk geometry , we found that the expected fe line ew for our value of @xmath2 ( assuming an inclination of 30@xmath83 and solar abundances ) is @xmath1880@xmath92 ev . in our broadband fits we see a considerably milder fe line flux with an ew closer to 40 ev , about half of the expected value .",
    "we found a similar , though less robust result using mytorus , with @xmath93 0.75@xmath94 and ew = 47@xmath92 ev ( calculated from the flux of the line ) which assumes a `` donut - like '' geometry , in this case a compton - thick torus out of the line of sight to the nucleus . in both cases",
    "we have found a lower than expected fe line ew , possibly due to an underabundance of fe .",
    "this makes it unlikely that there is significant contribution to the fe line flux from compton thin material in the vicinity of the black hole .",
    "this is in contrast to many seyferts ; for example the sample of rivers et al.(2011 ) , which utilized the pexrav disk reflection model , found that on average only @xmath1830% of the fe line flux in seyferts is associated with the compton reflection component , implying the presence of substantial amounts of compton - thin material and/or supersolar abundances of fe .",
    "however other samples of seyferts observed with _",
    "bepposax_and _ xmm - newton_(perola et al.2002 ; bianchi et al.2004 ) were shown to have values of ew and @xmath2 consistent with the fe line and reflection hump arising in the same material assuming a slab ( disk ) geometry and a torus geometry respectively . in all cases uncertainties",
    "have been quite large and further investigation is warranted .",
    "we have confirmed that mcg2 - 58 - 22  is unabsorbed in the x - ray band , a fact which is interesting considering its optical classification as a seyfert 1.5 ( winkler 1992 ; winter et al.2010 ) .",
    "standard unification schemes would suggest that it should have less obscuration in the x - ray band than a typical seyfert 2 but _ more _ than a typical seyfert 1 .",
    "however this is not the case , as we have obtained a very low upper limit on column density in excess of the galactic .",
    "the question then , is whether there is material in the line of sight to the optical emission from this agn that is _ not _ in the line of sight to the x - ray emitting region .",
    "optical reddening from dust can be characterized by the visual extinction ( @xmath95 ) , which we calculated from the flux ratio of h@xmath12 to h@xmath26 , using the observed values of winkler ( 1992 ) and assuming the intrinsic value of the balmer decrement to be 2.87 ( osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "we found @xmath95@xmath181.97  mag . from this value we calculated the inferred column density of gas using the relation of predehl & schmitt ( 1995 ) ,   @xmath6=@xmath96 @xmath97@xmath95 , and assuming the galactic gas / dust ratio holds .",
    "we inferred a column density of @xmath183.55@xmath98 @xmath9 , an order of magnitude higher than our upper limit on the observed x - ray absorption column ( in excess of the galactic ) of 2.5@xmath30 @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , assuming the x - ray absorbing gas and optical absorbing dust track each other , the dust obscuring the optical broad line region is most likely _ not _ in the line of sight to the x - ray emitting regions .",
    "the inferred column density is also far too low to be associated with the dusty torus out of the line of sight which must be compton - thick in order to produce the strong reflection component that we see ( mytorusgives a column density of 3.6@xmath99@xmath8 @xmath9 ) .",
    "since the x - ray emitting region is theorized to be very close in to the central black hole , it seems unlikely that this dust is in the form of an extended cloud in the host galaxy lying far ( kiloparsecs ) from the black hole that just happens to have a hole in the right place to produce a bare nucleus in the x - rays .",
    "the dust must be distinct , however , from the compton - thick torus , given the low inferred column density and evidence that we are viewing the agn more or less face on .",
    "one possible explanation for this set of constraints is that there is clumpy material in the line of sight and it happens that none of the clumps are obscuring the x - ray emitting region ( see , e.g. , nenkova et al.2008 ) , only the optical broad line region .",
    "if future x - ray monitoring discovers a sudden , short - term increase in @xmath6 , this scenario may be supported .",
    "another explanation is that the material is commensurate with the broad line region , thus obscuring only this region .      _",
    "suzaku_is an ideal tool for studying agn , providing us with a detailed look at many crucial components of agn spectra .",
    "we confirmed that mcg2 - 58 - 22  is extremely unabsorbed in the x - ray band ( an upper limit of 2.5@xmath30 @xmath9 in excess of the galactic column ) , despite significant reddening seen in the optical band .",
    "these results led us to conclude that while no absorbers are in the line of sight to the central region of the agn , it is possible that clumps of material may be obscuring lines of sight to the region(s ) where the optical line emission is produced .    with the excellent resolution of the xis ccds around @xmath1857 kev we were able to accurately study the fe k complex .",
    "we found a narrow ( @xmath47100 kms@xmath5 ) fe k@xmath12  emission line and were able to constrain the location of the emitting material to much farther out than has been done with previous observations .",
    "we detected no significant broad fe line as we would expect to see from the inner portions of a radiatively efficient accretion disk .",
    "since we have such a clean line of sight to the nucleus , this region can not be simply obscured or out of our line of sight , implying that the inner disk may be truncated or radiatively inefficient . from our limits on the fe line @xmath87",
    "we have calculated a minimum inner radius of @xmath901200 @xmath66 .",
    "we were also able to associate the fe emission complex with the compton reflection component in our models .",
    "our results indicate that both components likely arise in the same compton - thick material without any contribution from additional compton - thin circumnuclear material . assuming a disk / slab geometry ( the pexravmodel in xspec ) for the compton - thick material gave a reflection strength @xmath2=0.69@xmath10.05 with a photon index of @xmath0=1.80@xmath10.02 .",
    "we successfully applied the new mytorusmodel for compton reflection , which assumes that the reflecting material is in the form of a torus of uniform density rather than in the form of a flat disk , as has typically been done with more established models such as pexrav .",
    "our results gave a photon index of @xmath0=1.70@xmath10.01 with a column density of @xmath6=3.6@xmath7@xmath8 @xmath9 for the torus .",
    "additionally we found a lower than expected normalization for the fe line , possibly due to subsolar abundances of fe with z@xmath100=0.75@xmath10.14 .",
