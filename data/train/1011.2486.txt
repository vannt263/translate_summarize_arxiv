    "a very interesting class of heusler compounds that has received considerable theoretical , but only few experimental attention to date , are the half - metallic ferrimagnets mn@xmath0_yz _ , where _ y _ = v , cr , mn , fe , co , ni , cu and _ z _ is a group iii , iv , or v element @xcite .",
    "half - metallic compounds are characterized by a gap for either the spin - down or the spin - up density of states ( dos ) at the fermi energy , so that an electric current has purely up or down electrons .",
    "this property makes them highly interesting for applications in spintronics .",
    "a half - metallic ferrimagnet has advantages over the well - known half - metallic ferromagnets : due to the internal spin compensation it has rather low magnetic moment , while the curie temperature remains fairly high .",
    "a low magnetic moment gives rise to low stray fields , which is desired for spintronics , as is a high curie temperature and thus a good thermal stability of the compound @xcite .",
    "the most prominent compound out of this class is mn@xmath0val , which has been studied thoroughly by experiment and theory @xcite .",
    "together with numerous other compounds in the mn@xmath0v__z _ _ series it has been predicted to be a half - metallic ferrimagnet @xcite . its low magnetic moment of about @xmath2 per formula unit ( f.u . ) and the high curie temperature of 760k make it a promising compound for spintronics @xcite .",
    "several other materials classes have been proposed to be half - metallic ferrimagnets , e.g. , cr@xmath3mn@xmath4se and cr@xmath3mn@xmath4te in the zinc blende structure @xcite , or cr antisites in cras , crsb , crse , and crte , having the zinc blende structure @xcite .",
    "ideally , an electrode material for spintronics would be a half - metal with zero net moment .",
    "this can not be achieved with antiferromagnets because of the spin - rotational symmetry ( resulting in zero polarization ) , but well chosen half - metallic ferrimagnets can be tuned to zero moment .",
    "this property is also known as half - metallic antiferromagnetism , and has been first predicted for mn and in doped fevsb @xcite . among others ,",
    "la@xmath0vmno@xmath5 and related double perovskites @xcite and certain diluted magnetic semiconductors have been later predicted to be half - metallic antiferromagnets as well @xcite .",
    "finally , the ferrimagnetic heusler compounds mn@xmath0val and mn@xmath0vsi have been proposed as a starting point for doping with co to achieve the full compensation @xcite .",
    "however , it should be noted that the half - metallic antiferromagnetism is limited to zero temperature and a small macroscopic net moment is expected at elevated temperature  in particular near the curie temperature  because of the inequivalent magnetic sublattices @xcite .    following the slater - pauling rule connecting the magnetic moment @xmath6 and the number of valence electrons @xmath7 via @xmath1 in the half - metallic heusler compounds @xcite , it is expected to find another series of ferrimagnetic half - metals in the mn@xmath0ti__z _ _ system with @xmath8 to @xmath9/f.u .",
    "the negative moment indicates that the half - metallic gap would appear for the majority states .",
    "these compounds could  if they are half - metals  provide another series of potential electrodes for spin - dependent applications and could also become a starting point for half - metallic antiferromagnetism .    in this paper , we discuss _ ab initio _ calculations of the properties of the ( hypothetical ) mn@xmath0ti__z _ _ compounds , crystallized in the l2@xmath10 structure .",
    "no experimental data are available for this system , and only mn@xmath0tial has been studied theoretically before @xcite . however , it is expected that parts of this series will exist in the l2@xmath10 structure , seeing that mn@xmath0val and mn@xmath0vga , as well as parts of the co@xmath0ti__z _ _ series have been prepared @xcite .",
    "the calculations presented in this study were performed within two different density functional theory - based band structure codes : the full - potential linearized augmented plane waves ( flapw ) package elk @xcite and the full - potential korringa - kohn - rostoker _ munich _ sprkkr @xcite package .",
    "although both methods are in principle equivalent for crystalline systems , there are subtle differences associated with their numerical implementations , and thus it is worth to compare both methods on the rather complex intermetallic system mn@xmath0tiz .",
    "elk was used to determine the theoretical lattice parameters and the total energy differences between ferrimagnetic and nonmagnetic states .",
    "these calculations were carried out on a @xmath11 @xmath12 point mesh ( 72 points in the irreducible wedge of the brillouin zone ) .",
    "the muffin - tin radii of all atoms were set to 2.0 a.u . to avoid overlaps at small lattice parameters .",
    "the equilibrium lattice parameters @xmath13 were determined using a third - degree polynomial fit to the total energies . to obtain accurate magnetic moments and densities of states ,",
    "the calculations were performed at the equilibrium lattice parameter using a @xmath14 @xmath12-mesh ( 145 points in the irreducible wedge ) and nearly touching muffin - tin spheres .",
    "the sprkkr calculations were performed on the theoretical equilibrium lattice parameters determined with elk .",
    "the calculations were carried out in the full - potential mode with an angular momentum cutoff of @xmath15 on a @xmath16 @xmath12 point mesh ( 289 points in the irreducible wedge of the brillouin zone ) . both the full potential as well as the increased angular momentum cutoff are necessary to ensure accurate results .",
    "the dos were calculated on a denser mesh of 1145 @xmath12 points with 0.5mry added as the imaginary part to the energy .",
    "the exchange - correlation potential was modeled within the generalized gradient approximation of perdew , burke , and ernzerhof in both schemes @xcite .",
    "the calculations were converged to about 0.1 mev .",
    "all calculations were carried out in the scalar - relativistic representation of the valence states , thus neglecting the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "sprkkr allows to calculate the heisenberg exchange coupling parameters @xmath17 within a real - space approach using an expression proposed by liechtenstein _",
    "_ @xcite . using the @xmath17",
    "the curie temperatures were calculated within the mean field approximation ( mfa ) . for a single - lattice system",
    "the curie temperature is given within the mfa by @xmath18 in a multi - sublattice system  as , e.g. , the heusler compounds with four sublattices ",
    "one has to solve the coupled equations @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the average @xmath21 component of the unit vector @xmath22 pointing in the direction of the magnetic moment at site ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) .",
    "the coupled equations can be rewritten as an eigenvalue problem : @xmath25 with a unit matrix @xmath26 and the vector @xmath27 .",
    "the largest eigenvalue of the @xmath28 matrix gives the curie temperature @xcite . in order to separate the two mn lattices ,",
    "the calculations were run in f@xmath29 m space group , in which the mn atoms are not equivalent by symmetry .",
    "the @xmath24-summation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : multi ] ) was taken to a radius of @xmath30 , which has been shown to be sufficient for half - metallic heusler compounds @xcite .",
    "three types of magnetic configurations were tested : ferro- , ferri- , and nonmagnetic .",
    "it was found for all compounds that the ferromagnetic configurations were unstable and converged into the ferrimagnetic state .",
    "[ fig1 ] displays the total energies of the ferrimagnetic and the nonmagnetic configurations in dependence on the lattice parameters @xmath13 .",
    "we find that the ferrimagnetic state has always lower energy than the non - magnetic state ; the difference in total energy reduces with increasing number of valence electrons , but it increases within the groups with the atomic number .",
    "the lattice parameters follow roughly a linear dependence on the atomic radius of the _ z _ element with the correlation coefficient of @xmath31 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) ) .",
    "some compounds show a strong asymmetry of the total energy curve in the ferrimagnetic configuration and even kinks in the curves for very large @xmath13 .",
    "this is caused by a steep increase of the magnetic moments for increasing @xmath13 which causes a stronger binding .",
    "however , this effect is never strong enough to shift the equilibrium lattice parameter to such a high-@xmath6 state .",

    "[ fig3 ] .      from the rule",
    "@xmath1 we expect to find a magnetic moment of @xmath35 for these compounds .",
    "the flapw calculations show small deviations from this rule , indicating that the compounds are not perfect half - metals .",
    "this is confirmed by the dos , which show spin polarizations at the fermi level below 50% , and in particular only 7% for mn@xmath0tiin , where the magnetic moment is enhanced to @xmath36 .",
    "this arises from the large lattice parameter and the fact that all three compounds do not form a gap in the dos .",
    "the fermi level for mn@xmath0tial and mn@xmath0tiga is in a region with low dos for both spin channels ( see insets in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , but both of them have a very large empty spin - down dos right above @xmath37 .",
    "small variations of the lattice parameter would thus lead to strong variations of the spin polarization .",
    "( a ) : dependence of the lattice parameter @xmath13 on the atomic radius of the _ z _ element .",
    "( b ) : normalized magnetic moments of mn and ti in dependence of the lattice parameter . ]",
    "the calculations performed with sprkkr reproduce the magnetic moments obtained in elk very well .",
    "although the total moments are practically equal , a larger deviation is found for the atom - resolved moments .",
    "the fermi energy is found at slightly different positions in the dos , and the detailed structures observed in elk around @xmath37 are less pronounced , especially the dip in the spin - down states at @xmath37 .",
    "this leads to significantly higher spin polarization values in sprkkr .",
    "however , the trend that mn@xmath0tiin has the lowest polarization within this group is reproduced .          according to the `` rule of 24 '' a total magnetic moment of @xmath38",
    "is expected .",
    "again , small deviations from this rule are observed ; all moments are lower by about 1.5% . in elk ,",
    "the three compounds are found to form a half - metallic gap in the spin - up states slightly above @xmath37 .",
    "the gap onset above @xmath37 ( width ) is 0.16ev ( 0.49ev ) for si , 0.24ev ( 0.25ev ) for ge , and 0.19ev ( 0.01ev ) for sn . nevertheless , the spin polarization is above 90% in these calculations .",
    "the structure of the dos around @xmath37 leads to a stable spin polarization and magnetic moment upon isotropic lattice compression or expansion . for this series ,",
    "having the same valence electron counts and nearly half - metallic dos , one can observe clearly a narrowing of the bands , i.e. , the dos are contracted towards @xmath37 , while the fermi level itself moves upwards .",
    "this is directly associated with the gradually increasing lattice parameter in this series , which reduces the overlap of the 3d orbitals and thereby reduces the itinerancy of the system .",
    "an increased localization of the electrons provides also an explanation for the increasing atomic magnetic moments along this series .",
    "similar behavior has been observed earlier for co@xmath0mn__z _ _ , with _ _",
    "z__=si , ge , sn @xcite and ni@xmath0mnsn @xcite . in the first case",
    "the mn moment is increased and the co moment is lowered along the series , keeping the total moment integer .",
    "calculations on co@xmath0mnsi with increased lattice parameter reproduced this behavior . in the second case , the pressure dependence of the moments was studied . under increasing pressure ,",
    "i.e. , with reduced lattice parameter , both the ni and the mn moment decrease , and thus the total moment decreases .",
    "however , ni@xmath0mnsn is not a half - metal , hence the total moment is not restricted to an integer value .",
    "consequently , both observations on quite different ferromagnetic heusler compounds are in accord with our case of ( nearly ) half - metallic ferrimagnetic heusler compounds .",
    "we note , that the magnetic moments and dos from sprkkr are in very good agreement with the ones obtained from elk .",
    "however , the fermi level is found at a lower position , giving rise to the slightly reduced polarization values .      in these cases a total magnetic moment of only @xmath39 is expected . because of the very small lattice parameter of mn@xmath0tip , its spin - splitting is small with only @xmath40 in the elk calculation .",
    "the situation of mn@xmath0tias and mn@xmath0tisb is similar to that of mn@xmath0tisi and mn@xmath0tige .",
    "a spin - up gap is formed above the fermi level with onset ( width ) of 0.29ev ( 0.53ev ) for as and 0.19ev ( 0.44ev ) for sb . though not being half - metallic , both compounds have spin polarizations of more than 80% .    finally , the magnetic moments of mn@xmath0tisb in sprkkr agree very well with those obtained with elk . but again , the fermi level is lower and the spin polarization is reduced . for mn@xmath0tip and mn@xmath0tias",
    "the situation is quite different .",
    "they can not be converged into ferrimagnetic states at the equilibrium lattice parameters determined by elk ; instead , they are found to be nonmagnetic .",
    "this is caused by the tiny energy difference between the ferrimagnetic and the nonmagnetic configuration , which leads to a numerical instability of the ferrimagnetic state . by increasing the lattice parameter of mn@xmath0tias by about 2% to 5.95 ,",
    "the separation is increased artificially to about 30mev / f.u .",
    "and the calculation converges into the ferrimagnetic state .",
    "because of this , the properties obtained with sprkkr for this compound have to be taken with care : in all other cases the individual atomic moments are slightly lower in sprkkr than those from elk ; here instead , larger moments are found .",
    "however , the same procedure can not be applied to mn@xmath0tip , within a reasonable range of lattice parameters .",
    "it is worth to note that the magnetic moments of the @xmath41 component are always below 0.06@xmath42 and that they are always parallel to the ti moment . in detail , the values are al 0.044@xmath42 , ga 0.052@xmath42 , in 0.058@xmath42 , si 0.034@xmath42 , ge 0.035@xmath42 , sn 0.034@xmath42 , p 0.0062@xmath42 , as 0.018@xmath42 , and sb 0.017@xmath42 .",
    "another property worth noting is the fact that the ratios @xmath43 and @xmath44 follow a linear dependence ( with correlation coefficients of @xmath45 in both cases for the elk data ) on the lattice parameter ( and hence the interatomic distances ) independently on the @xmath41 type , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) .",
    "as mentioned above , with increasing lattice parameter the itinerant character of the system is reduced and localizes the moments gradually on the atoms .",
    "therefore , the influence of the _ z _ component in mn@xmath0ti__z _ _ is twofold .",
    "first , it determines the lattice parameter of the compound and following from that , the degree of electron localization . and",
    "second , the total magnetic moment is determined via the number of electrons supplied , if the lattice parameter does not exceed a certain range ( which is not the case for p and in ) .",
    "the exchange interactions are investigated here for mn@xmath0tiga , mn@xmath0tige , and mn@xmath0tisb , which are representative compounds for their respective _ z _ group .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( a ) displays the @xmath17 calculated for the intra - sublattice interaction mn@xmath46-mn@xmath46 and the inter - sublattice interactions mn@xmath46-mn@xmath47 and mn - ti of the three compounds .",
    "all other interactions are very small and can be neglected for the following discussion .    in all three cases",
    "it is clear that the mn@xmath46-mn@xmath47 inter - sublattice interaction provides the largest contribution to the exchange .",
    "further , the nearest neighbor interaction of mn - ti is always negative , hence all compounds are ferrimagnets .",
    "all interactions are mostly confined within a radius of @xmath48 .",
    "apart from these similarities , there are many interesting differences .",
    "first , we discuss the details of the dominating inter - sublattice interaction mn@xmath46-mn@xmath47 .",
    "the first and second nearest neighbors provide a large , positive exchange .",
    "the second nearest neighbors have two different values of @xmath17 .",
    "this is a feature that is not observed in frozen - magnon calculations ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , because the fourier transform that is necessary to obtain the exchange parameters involves a spherical averaging . instead ,",
    "with the real - space approach used here we observe a difference for mn atoms with a ti atom or a _ z _ atom in between .",
    "we found larger values on the mn atoms mediated via ti and lower values on the _ z _ mediated ones .",
    "the nearest mn neighbors have a distance of about 2.95 , and the exchange is apparently indirect . for direct exchange , one would expect a scaling with the magnetic moments , which is not observed here",
    ". it rather oscillates with the sp electron number .",
    "a similar result has been obtained earlier on other half and full heusler compounds @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the nearest and second nearest neighbor coupling is significantly reduced with increasing electron concentration , and the nearest neighbor interaction dominates in mn@xmath0tisb .",
    "heisenberg exchange parameters @xmath17 in dependence on the normalized distance @xmath49 .",
    "( a ) : @xmath17 for mn@xmath0tiga , mn@xmath0tige , mn@xmath0tisb for their respective equilibrium lattice parameters .",
    "( b ) : @xmath17 for mn@xmath0tige with different lattice parameters .",
    "note the different scales of the vertical axes in the top row . ]",
    "the antiferromagnetic mn - ti interaction is only significant for the nearest neighbors .",
    "accordingly , the interaction between mn and ti , which have a distance of about 2.55 is essentially given by direct exchange coupling and the scaling with the ti moment corroborates this assumption .",
    "the intra - sublattice interaction of mn@xmath46-mn@xmath46 exhibits a notable oscillatory behavior .",
    "in the two cases with odd valence electron number it is positive for the nearest neighbors , negative for the second , and again positive for the third nearest neighbors .",
    "for mn@xmath0tige with its even electron count the first two neighbors have negative and the third neighbor has positive interaction .",
    "so in the latter case , the total mn - mn intra - sublattice interaction is effectively antiferromagnetic .",
    "in order to study the dependence of @xmath17 on the lattice parameter as a possible explanation for the differences discussed above , additional calculations on mn@xmath0tige have been performed with lattice parameters of @xmath50 .",
    "this compound was chosen because of the wide ( pseudo-)gap for the spin - up states , which warrants a stable total magnetic moment and minimal band structure effects over the range of @xmath13 used here .",
    "the results from these calculations are given in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( b ) . obviously , the changes here are rather subtle and can not account for the the large differences discussed above . however , we note a reduction of the nearest neighbor mn@xmath46-mn@xmath47 interaction and of the ti mediated second nearest mn@xmath46-mn@xmath47 neighbor . meanwhile , the mn - ti interaction increases , in agreement with increased mn and ti moments .",
    "the strong confinement of the exchange interactions to a sphere with a radius of about @xmath48 is reflected in the curie temperature calculated as a function of the cluster radius which is nearly converged at @xmath51 , see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( a ) . at larger",
    "radii a weak oscillation of @xmath52 is observed , indicating long - ranged rkky - like behaviour .",
    "a deeper discussion of the exchange interaction is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , it was recently shown for numerous half and full heusler compounds that various exchange mechanisms  such as rkky , superexchange and anderson s - d mixing ",
    "contribute to the indirect exchange interactions @xcite .",
    "the relevant contributions to the @xmath53 matrix in eq .",
    "( [ eq : multi ] ) are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( b ) . in agreement with the previous discussion",
    "it is found that the inter - sublattice interaction mn@xmath46-mn@xmath47 provides the largest contribution , followed by the mn - ti interaction , which can become as large as the mn@xmath46-mn@xmath47 interaction in mn@xmath0tiin .",
    "the intra - sublattice interaction mn@xmath46-mn@xmath46 is generally weak , positive for al , ga , in , and negative for si , ge , sn .",
    "all other inter- and intra - sublattice contributions are below 1mev .",
    "a negative intra - sublattice contribution means that the interaction acts against the ferromagnetic order on this lattice and thus reduces the curie temperature .    to estimate the accuracy of our method for the curie temperature determination , we calculated the curie temperatures of some heusler compounds at their respective experimental lattice parameters .",
    "the calculated ( experimental ) values are : co@xmath0mnsi 1049k ( 985k)@xcite , co@xmath0tisn 383k ( 355k)@xcite , mn@xmath0val 605k ( 760k)@xcite and mn@xmath0vga 560k ( 783k)@xcite .",

    "the significantly lower curie temperature of mn@xmath0tias with respect to mn@xmath0tisb can be attributed to the artificially increased lattice parameter used in the calculation .",

    "the origin of this behavior is attributed to the mn - mn distance and the indirect exchange between the mn atoms , which fully carry the magnetism of the compounds .",

    "experimentally this dependence on the lattice parameter was even observed for the co@xmath0ti__z _ _ series ( with _ z _ = si , ge , sn ) , where the ti atoms have nearly vanishing magnetic moment @xcite .",

    "most of the compounds have large spin polarization and a spin - up gap forms above the fermi energy .",
    "the curie temperatures calculated within the mean - field approximation indicate that the compounds with 21 and 22 valence electrons will be ferrimagnetic at room temperature . a thorough understanding of the influence of the _ z _ component on the properties of the compounds has been established on the basis of _ ab initio _ band structure and exchange coupling calculations .",
    "it was found that the pressure dependence of @xmath56 is positive , in agreement with ferromagentic full heusler compounds . because of their large and stable spin polarizations and their high curie temperatures we propose in particular mn@xmath0tisi , mn@xmath0tige , and mn@xmath0tisn as candidates for spintronic applications .",
