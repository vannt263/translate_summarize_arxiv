    "one of the most remarkable phenomena arising in superconducting systems is the josephson effect .",
    "josephson@xcite showed that a condensate current @xmath22can flow in an s / i / s junction being a periodic function of the gauge - invariant phase difference between superconductors @xmath23 , where the limits of the integration @xmath24 and @xmath25 mean respectively the right and left superconductors s separated by an insulating layer i , and @xmath26 is the josephson critical current .    in the case of a magnetic ordering  ferromagnetic  ( f ) or antiferromagnetic  ( af)the order parameter is the magnetization  @xmath27 ( in the antiferromagnets the vector  @xmath28 is the magnetization in one of the sublattices ) .",

    "the absence of the dissipation for the spin current and the possibility to use this dissipationless current in spintronics has been discussed in many papers@xcite ( see also reviews  ) .",
    "unfortunately , using the spin currents in spintronics does not seem to be straightforward because the analogy between the spin and charge currents is not complete , namely , the spin current is not a conserved quantity.@xcite we will demonstrate the validity of this statement considering the proximity effect in af / f structures . in particular , we will calculate the spin current through a josephson - like af / f / af junction .",

    "this expression for  @xmath47 is valid if the condition @xmath48 is fulfilled , where @xmath49 is the momentum relaxation time .",
    "usually , the exchange field  @xmath7 is much larger than the critical temperature of the superconducting transition  @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , the cooper pairs wave function oscillates in space .",
    "it consists of the singlet component  @xmath50 , and the triplet component  @xmath51 with zero projection of the total spin on the direction of the magnetization  @xmath28 .",
    "such oscillations lead to a change of the sign of the josephson critical current  @xmath26 , and the so called @xmath52-state is realized in the junction .    another interesting effect predicted in ref .",
    "( see also the reviews  ) and observed in several experiments klapwijk , sosnin , birge , chan , blamirescience , westerholt , aarts , deutscher in s / f structures , is related to a new type of superconducting correlations .",
    "this type of correlations called `` odd triplet superconductivity '' can arise due to the proximity effect in the f - layer with a nonhomogeneous magnetization . in the case of a uniform magnetization in the f - layer , the pair wave function there has both the singlet component @xmath53 and the triplet component @xmath54 with zero projection of the total spin of the cooper pair on the direction of the magnetization .",
    "both components oscillate in space and decay on a short length of the order of  @xmath55 . in the ballistic case",

    "the situation changes drastically if the magnetization in f is not uniform in the nearest vicinity of the s / f interface.@xcite in this case , not only the components  @xmath57 and  @xmath51 arise in the f - layer , but also the triplet component  @xmath58 with nonzero projection of the total spin on  @xmath28 is generated .",
    "this component is insensitive to the exchange field and penetrates the f - layer over a long ( compared to  @xmath59 ) distance .",
    "the penetration length does not depend on the exchange field  @xmath60 and is much larger than  @xmath61 . in absence of the spin - orbit interaction and scattering by magnetic impurities",
    "this length may become comparable with the penetration length of the superconducting condensate into the diffusive normal  ( nonmagnetic ) metal @xmath62 .",
    "the component  @xmath63 can be called the long - range triplet component  ( lrtc ) .",
    "it is symmetric in the momentum space and is therefore also insensitive to the scattering by ordinary  ( nonmagnetic ) impurities . in this respect",
    "the lrtc differs drastically from the usual triplet component  @xmath64 that describes superconductivity in  @xmath65.@xcite the latter is an antisymmetric function of the momentum  @xmath66 and is therefore destroyed by ordinary impurities .",
    "the correlator  @xmath63 changes sign by permutation of the operators  @xmath67 and  @xmath68 , as it should be according to the pauli principle , which follows from the fact that the fermi operators  @xmath67 and  @xmath68 anticommute at equal times .",
    "this means that @xmath69 , i.e. , the function  @xmath70 is an odd function of time  @xmath71 or , in other words , it is an odd function of the frequency  @xmath72 in the fourier representation .",
    "that is why this component is called `` odd triplet component '' .",
    "recent experiments unambiguously confirmed the existence of the lrtc in the s / f structures with a nonhomogeneous magnetization.klapwijk,sosnin,birge,chan,blamirescience,westerholt,aarts,deutscher    in this paper we show that the analogy between the superconducting and magnetic order parameters in josephson - like junctions is deeper than it was indicated previously .",
    "it turns out that in the sdw / f / sdw junction with a ballistic f - layer the `` short''- and long - range af order parameters are induced in the f - layer in an af / f structure ( we use the quotation marks for `` short''-range , to indicate that in the considered ballistic case this component does not decay on a short range , but rather oscillates with a short period ) .",
    "the component of the af order parameter with the @xmath28  vector ( in each sublattice ) being parallel to the magnetization vector in the f - layer  @xmath73 , which is supposed to be oriented along the @xmath30-axis , penetrates into the f - layer and oscillates with a short period of the order of  @xmath74 . on the other hand ,",
    "the sdw with the @xmath28  vector perpendicular to  @xmath73 penetrates the f - layer over a long distance of the order of  @xmath75 and decays monotonously .",
    "this part of the sdw order parameter may be called the long - range component induced in the ferromagnetic layer .    at the same time , in spite of the long - range penetration of the af correlations into the ferromagnet  f , the spin current that arises at the af / f interface is not constant in space .",
    "it oscillates in the f region with a short period .",
