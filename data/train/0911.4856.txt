    "characterizing many - body systems by understanding their different phases is a key issue in physics .",
    "however , it is only in a few cases that exact analytical techniques can be applied @xcite .",
    "it is therefore crucial to have approximate methods to deal with such systems to predict their different physical properties @xcite .",
    "a very useful method is to use mean field theory ( mft ) @xcite , which renders the many - body physical system into one with a single particle .",
    "mft allows one to predict the single - body physical properties , like magnetization , susceptibility , of the system .",
    "its importance lies in the fact that these mft - reduced one - body properties can correctly predict the thermal fluctuation- and quantum fluctuation- driven phase transitions of the system , as well as the critical exponents of the such single - body physical quantities @xcite .",
    "useful as it is , there are important limitations of a mean field theory @xcite , a first being that it is not possible to predict the multi - party physical properties , like entanglement , of the system by using this theory .    in this paper ,",
    "we propose an `` entanglement mean field theory '' ( emft ) , which transforms an interacting many - body physical system into a two - body one , while still retaining certain footprints of the interactions in the many - body parent , using which it is possible to calculate the two - body properties , like two - point entanglement and two - point correlations , of the system , and predict the critical phenomena in it .",
    "moreover , it is possible to calculate the critical exponents of two - body properties .",
    "the theory can be applied for detecting phase transitions driven by thermal fluctuations as well as quantum fluctuations . at the same time , both quantum as well as classical models can be treated by emft , where in the classical case , this will be only until the level of correlations . in this paper",
    ", we will only consider the applications of emft to quantum systems .",
    "we will consider three paradigmatic classes of interacting spin models , viz .",
    "the transverse anisotropic quantum xy ( which includes the transverse quantum ising ) , the transverse quantum xx , and the quantum heisenberg models .",
    "the phase transitions of these models , both temperature - induced phase transitions as well as zero temperature quantum phase transitions , are faithfully signaled by the corresponding emft entanglements .",
    "the curie - weiss law of susceptibility is an important prediction of the mean field - reduced heisenberg model in the paramagnetic regime @xcite .",
    "we indicate the corresponding law for emft - reduced correlations by using the emft - reduced heisenberg model .",
    "the entanglement mean field theory opens up the possibility of investigating the behavior of entanglement and other two - body properties of many - body systems , particularly for the ones which does not lend themselves to an analytical treatment . at the fundamental level , this forms , potentially , an important link between many - body physics and quantum information science @xcite .",
    "before presenting the entanglement mean field theory , let us briefly remind ourselves the mean field theory . consider the transverse quantum anisotropic xy model with nearest - neighbor interactions , described by the hamiltonian @xmath0                                                                         - h \\sum_{\\vec{i } } \\sigma_z^{\\vec{i } } , \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which represents a system of interacting spin-1/2 particles on a @xmath1-dimensional cubic lattice . the coupling strength @xmath2 is positive , the anisotropy @xmath3 $ ] , and the transverse field strength @xmath4 is also positive .",
    "@xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are the pauli matrices for the spin degree of freedom of a spin-1/2 particle .",
    "@xmath8 indicates that the corresponding sum runs over nearest neighbor lattice sites only .",
    "the mean field theory consists in assuming that a particular spin , say @xmath9 , is special , and replacing all other spin operators by their mean values . denoting the mean values of the spin operators @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 as @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , respectively ,",
    "this leads to an mft hamiltonian @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "we then solve the self - consistency equations ( mean field equations ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the mean field canonical equilibrium state @xmath16 , for @xmath10 and @xmath11 , substitute them in @xmath17 and @xmath15 , and we are then ready to find the single - body physical properties of the system in the mean field limit . here",
    "@xmath18 , with @xmath19 denoting temperature on the absolute scale , and @xmath20 denoting the boltzmann constant .    the entanglement mean field theory begins by replacing an identity , on a site that is neighboring the interacting spins of a two - spin interaction term , by a square of the pauli matrix that is involved in the interaction , for all the two - spin interaction terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "[ an averaging needs to be done for two - spin interactions involving two pauli matrices . ] therefore , the term @xmath21 in a hamiltonian on a two - dimensional square lattice can be replaced by @xmath22 .",
    "the latter can be re - written as @xmath23 , with @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "we then assume that a certain pair of two neighboring spins are `` special '' .",
    "we then replace the non - special two - spin interactions ( with nearby spins ) in all the interaction terms by their mean values . in a @xmath1-dimensional cubic lattice",
    ", there will be @xmath26 terms ( with @xmath27 being the coordination number of the lattice ) , that will have the special pair , along with two other spins in two other lattice sites .",
    "the emft - reduced hamiltonian , for the transverse quantum ferromagnetic xy model on a @xmath1-dimensional cubic lattice , will therefore be @xmath28 \\nonumber \\\\                             - h\\left [ \\sigma_z^{\\vec{i } } + \\sigma_z^{\\vec{j } } \\right)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have ignored the terms in the hamiltonian which will not contribute to the emft equations below , and where we have assumed that the neighboring lattice sites @xmath29 and @xmath30 are special .",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 are respectively the @xmath33 and @xmath34 correlators , and the self - consistency equations ( emft equations ) are @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the canonical equilibrium state @xmath37 .",
    "the emft equations are to be solved for @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and substituted in @xmath38 and @xmath36 .",
    "we can then calculate the two - particle physical properties of the physical system described by @xmath39 in the emft limit , and look for possible phase transitions of the system .    a similar formalism works , with slight modifications , for classical spins , higher quantum spins , more complex lattices , etc .",
    "also , both the mean field theory as well as the emft has been described for the ferromagnetic cases .",
    "the antiferromagnetic case requires some modifications in the mean field theory , and correspondingly some changes in the emft .",
    "these will not be discussed in this paper .      for simplicity ,",
    "let us consider the transverse quantum ising model ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "this is the simplest model which exhibits a quantum phase transition ( at zero temperature ) @xcite , that has been experimentally observed @xcite . for which the emft equation reads @xmath41,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the corresponding emft ising partition function is given by @xmath42 , with @xmath43 .",
    "we are now ready to present the emft phase diagram , where we use the @xmath33 correlator , @xmath31 , as the order parameter of the many - body system .",
    "let us first look at the @xmath44 picture , where transitions are driven by quantum fluctuations only .",
    "the zero temperature emft @xmath31 is given by @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "it is vanishing otherwise .",
    "let us now fix our attention on the other extreme : the behavior of the system with respect to temperature for zero field , in which case the emft equation reduces to @xmath47 whereby a temperature - driven phase transition is obtained at @xmath48 .",
    "the complete phase diagram can be seen in fig .",

    "[ fig - chhobi - ek ]    it is possible to calculate the critical exponents in the emft limit .",
    "the critical exponent for the emft @xmath33 correlator can be calculated as follows , which we find for both the temperature - driven phase transition on the @xmath49 axis , and for the quantum phase transition on the @xmath44 axis .",
    "in the zero temperature scenario , the critical exponent is @xmath50 , as can be found by using eq .",
    "( [ snajh - ghurte - jabe - bolchhe ] ) . in the zero field case",
    ", we can perform an expansion of the equation , @xmath51 around @xmath52 , and the critical exponent is again @xmath50 . in a similar fashion , one can obtain the critical exponent for the emft energy gap to be @xmath50 . note that the same exponent is obtained for the gap in the mft limit @xcite .",
    "the entanglement mean field theory can not only predict the correlations of the system , but one can also study the behavior of its entanglement . apart from its fundamental importance , entanglement is known to be the basic ingredient in quantum information tasks @xcite . we will quantify the entanglement of a two - party quantum state @xmath53 , by its logarithmic negativity @xcite , defined as @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes the trace norm of its argument , and",
    "@xmath56 denotes the partial transpose of @xmath53 with respect to one of the two parties forming the state @xmath53 .",

    "the physical importance of the hamiltonian includes that it can be obtained from the bose hubbard hamiltonian for hard - core boson limit , by suitably associating the bosonic creation and annihilation operators with the pauli matrices @xcite .",

    "it is also possible to write an emft equation for the ground state of the emft - reduced xx hamiltonian , solving which we find @xmath63 it is interesting to compare this result with the fact that the physical system represented by the hamiltonian @xmath64 , in the one - dimensional case , undergoes a mott insulator to superfluid transition at @xmath65 @xcite .",
