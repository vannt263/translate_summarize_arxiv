    "often the smallest eigenvalue distribution plays a crucial role in investigating the behavior of the system under study .",
    "for instance , in the context of multiple input multiple output ( mimo ) communication , the smallest eigenvalue of wishart - laguerre ensemble determines the minimum distance between the received vectors  @xcite , and also the lower bound on the channel capacity that eventually is used in antenna selection techniques  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the smallest eigenvalue density of fixed trace wishart - laguerre ensemble serves as an important metric for characterizing the entanglement in bipartite systems  @xcite .",
    "matrices governed by wishart distribution are parametrized by their size ( @xmath0 ) and the degree of freedom ( @xmath1 )  @xcite ; see section [ sec2 ] . in this paper",
    "we use the term _ regular _ to mean unrestricted trace wishart matrices with @xmath2 .",

    "for complex matrices , the result for the cumulative distribution of the smallest eigenvalue goes back to khatri , who worked out a determinant - based expression  @xcite .",
    "forrester and hughes have given closed expressions for the density of the smallest and second - smallest eigenvalues in terms of wronskian and toeplitz determinants  @xcite .",

    "even with the availability of modern computational packages , the former becomes impractical as @xmath0 increases , while the latter becomes inadequate as @xmath4 increase .",
    "we should remark that the smallest eigenvalue density has also been worked out for correlated wishart - laguerre ensembles , both for real and complex cases  @xcite .",

    "forrester and hughes have worked out an iterative scheme for the cumulative distribution of the smallest eigenvalue . however , to the best of our knowledge , an iterative scheme analogous to that of edelman s , for direct evaluation of the probability density of the smallest eigenvalue has hitherto remained unavailable . in the present work , we derive the recurrence scheme that applies to the complex wishart - laguerre ensemble .",
    "these results involve an ` exponential times polynomial ' structure .",
    "since the fixed trace ensemble is related to the regular wishart - laguerre ensemble via a laplace transform , the structure of the smallest eigenvalue density in the latter leads to a very convenient calculation of density in the former case as well  @xcite .",
