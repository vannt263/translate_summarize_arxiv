    "a historically important extension of bose and fermi statistics has been known for 50 years , namely the para - bose and para - fermi statistics as developed by green  @xcite . in para - statistics , the usual bilinear commutators or anti - commutators for bosons and fermions",
    "are replaced by certain trilinear or triple relations .",
    "for example , for @xmath8 pairs of para - bose creation and annihilation operators @xmath9 ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) , the defining relations are : @xmath12= ( \\epsilon -\\xi ) \\delta_{jl } b_{k}^{\\eta } +   ( \\epsilon -\\eta ) \\delta_{kl}b_{j}^{\\xi } , \\label{para - bose } \\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad \\xi , \\eta , \\epsilon = \\pm\\hbox { or } \\pm 1;\\quad j , k , l=1,\\ldots , n . \\nn \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] similar triple relations hold for the para - fermi operators @xmath13  @xcite , see ( 1.1 ) in  @xcite . both for para - bose and para - fermi statistics , there is a group theoretical setting .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that the lie algebra generated by the @xmath14 elements @xmath15 , with @xmath10 and @xmath11 , subject to the para - fermi relations is @xmath0 ( as a lie algebra defined by means of generators and relations ) .",
    "twenty years after the connection between para - fermi statistics and the lie algebra @xmath16 , a new connection , between para - bose statistics and the orthosymplectic lie superalgebra @xmath1  @xcite was discovered  @xcite .",
    "the lie superalgebra generated by @xmath14 odd elements @xmath17 , with @xmath10 and @xmath11 , subject to the triple relations  ( [ para - bose ] ) , is @xmath18 ( as a lie superalgebra defined by means of generators and relations ) .",
    "moreover , there is a certain representation of @xmath18 , the so - called bose representation @xmath19 , that yields the classical bose relations , i.e. where the representatives @xmath20 satisfy the relations of classical bose statistics . for more general para - bose statistics",
    ", a class of infinite dimensional @xmath18 representations needs to be investigated .",
    "these examples show that para - statistics , as introduced by green  @xcite and further developed by others ( see  @xcite and the references therein ) , can be associated with representations of the lie ( super)algebras of class @xmath21 ( namely @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) .",
    "whether alternative types of generalized quantum statistics can be found in the framework of other classes of simple lie algebras or superalgebras has been considered in particular by palev  @xcite- .",
    "building upon his examples and inspired by the definition of creation and annihilation operators in  @xcite , a mathematical definition of `` generalized quantum statistics '' was given in  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a complete classification was given of all the classes of generalized quantum statistics for the classical lie algebras @xmath24 , @xmath22 , @xmath25 and @xmath26  @xcite , by means of their algebraic relations .",
    "in the present paper we make a similar classification for the basic classical lie superalgebras .    for certain examples of quantum statistics associated with lie superalgebras , see  -",
    ". however , a complete classification was never made .",
    "a particular interesting example was described for the lie superalgebra @xmath27  . for this superalgebra , a set of odd creation and annihilation operators",
    "was given  @xcite , and it was shown that these @xmath8 pairs of operators @xmath28 , with @xmath10 and @xmath11 , subject to the defining relations @xmath29= \\delta_{jk } a^+_i - \\delta_{ij } a^+_k , \\nn\\\\ & & [ \\ { a^+_i , a^-_j\\},a^-_k]= -\\delta_{ik } a^-_j + \\delta_{ij } a^-_k , \\label{sl1n - relations}\\\\ & & \\{a^+_i , a^+_j\\}=\\{a^-_i , a^-_j\\}=0 , \\nn\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( @xmath30 ) , generate the special linear lie superalgebra @xmath31 ( as a lie superalgebra defined by means of generators and relations ) . just as in the case of para - bose relations , ( [ sl1n - relations ] ) has two interpretations . on the one hand",
    ", it describes the algebraic relations of a new kind of generalized statistics , in this case @xmath32-superstatistics or a statistics related to the lie superalgebra @xmath33 . on the other hand , ( [ sl1n - relations ] )",
    "yields a set of defining relations for the lie superalgebra @xmath33 in terms of generators and relations .",
    "observe that certain microscopic and macroscopic properties of this statistics have already been studied  .",
    "a description similar to ( [ sl1n - relations ] ) for the lie algebra @xmath24 was given for the first time by n.  jacobson  @xcite in the context of `` lie triple systems '' .",
    "therefore , this type of generators is often referred to as the `` jacobson generators '' . in this context",
    ", we shall mainly use the terminology `` creation and annihilation operators ( caos ) for @xmath31 '' .",
    "following the mathematical definition of `` generalized quantum statistics associated with a lie algebra '' , given in  @xcite , this notion will be extended to lie superalgebras @xmath2 .",
    "this definition , and the corresponding classification method , are described in section  [ sec2 ] . just as for the case of lie algebras",
    ", the method leads to a classification of certain gradings of @xmath2 , and to regular subalgebras of @xmath2 . in this process",
    ", dynkin diagram techniques play a crucial role . for the basic classical lie superalgebras",
    "however , the description by means of a dynkin diagram is not unique : besides the so - called distinguished dynkin diagram , other non - equivalent dynkin diagrams exist  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this feature will make it harder to obtain a complete classification of all generalized quantum systems . in the remaining sections ,",
    "the classification results are presented for all basic classical lie superalgebras .",
    "a final section discusses some possible applications .    for the basic classical lie superalgebras  @xcite",
    ", we use the notation @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the algebra @xmath1 has a different structure and is usually considered separately ( also here ) . for the classical simple lie algebras",
    ", we use the notation @xmath38 , @xmath0 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 ; note the difference between @xmath25 and @xmath6 .",
    "note also that for trivial values of @xmath41 or @xmath8 , a lie superalgebra coincides with a lie algebra : @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "let @xmath2 be a basic classical lie superalgebra .",
    "@xmath2 has a @xmath46-grading @xmath47 ; an element @xmath48 of @xmath49 is an even element ( @xmath50 ) , an element @xmath51 of @xmath52 is an odd element ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the elements which are purely even or odd are called homogeneous elements .",
    "the lie superalgebra bracket is denoted by @xmath54 . in the universal enveloping algebra of @xmath2",
    ", this stands for @xmath55 if @xmath48 and @xmath51 are homogeneous .",
    "so the bracket can be a commutator or an anti - commutator .",
    "just as for a lie algebra  @xcite , a generalized quantum statistics associated with @xmath2 is determined by a set of @xmath56 creation operators @xmath57 and @xmath56 annihilation operators @xmath58 . following the ideas of para - bose statistics and those of  @xcite",
    ", these @xmath59 operators should generate the lie superalgebra @xmath2 , subject to certain triple relations .",
    "let @xmath60 and @xmath61 be the subspaces of @xmath2 spanned by these elements : @xmath62 we do not require that these subspaces are homogeneous .",
    "the space @xmath63 can be zero ( in which case the creation operators mutually supercommute , as in  ( [ sl1n - relations ] ) ) or non - zero ( as in  ( [ para - bose ] ) ) .",
    "a similar statement holds for the annihilation operators and @xmath64 . putting @xmath65 and @xmath66",
    ", the condition that @xmath2 is generated by the @xmath59 elements subject to triple relations only , leads  @xcite to the requirement that @xmath67 , and this must be a @xmath3-grading of @xmath2 . since these subspaces are not necessarily homogeneous , this @xmath3-grading is in general not consistent with the @xmath46-grading .    just as in  @xcite",
    ", we shall impose two further requirements : first of all , the generating elements @xmath68 must be root vectors of @xmath2 .",
    "secondly , @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the standard antilinear anti - involutive mapping of @xmath2 ( in terms of root vectors @xmath71 , @xmath70 satisfies @xmath72 ) .",
    "this leads to the following definition , completely analogous as in  @xcite :    let @xmath2 be a basic classical lie superalgebra , with antilinear anti - involutive mapping @xmath70 .",
    "a set of @xmath59 root vectors @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) is called a set of creation and annihilation operators for @xmath2 if :    * @xmath75 , * @xmath67 is a @xmath3-grading of @xmath2 , with @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the algebraic relations @xmath78 satisfied by the operators @xmath68 are the relations of a generalized quantum statistics ( gqs ) associated with @xmath2 .",
    "this is a _ mathematical _ generalization of quantum statistics .",
    "whether all such gqs actually lead to physically acceptable quantum statistics remains to be seen ; in this sense one should interpret our gqs as `` candidates for generalizations of quantum statistics '' .",
    "a gqs is characterized by a set @xmath79 of caos and the set of algebraic relations @xmath78 they satisfy .",
    "a consequence of this definition is that @xmath2 is generated by @xmath61 and @xmath60 , i.e.  by the set of caos , and since @xmath77 , it follows that @xmath80 this implies that it is necessary and sufficient to give all relations of the following type :    * the set of all linear relations between the elements @xmath81 ( @xmath82 , @xmath83 ) .",
    "* the set of all triple relations of the form @xmath84 .",
    "so @xmath78 consists of a set of quadratic relations and a set of triple relations .",
    "also , as a lie superalgebra defined by generators and relations , @xmath2 is uniquely characterized by the set of generators @xmath68 subject to the relations @xmath78 .",
    "a consequence of this definition is that @xmath85 itself is a subalgebra of @xmath2 spanned by root vectors of @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "it follows that @xmath85 is a regular subalgebra containing the cartan subalgebra @xmath86 of @xmath2 . by the adjoint action ,",
    "the remaining @xmath87 s are @xmath85-modules .",
    "thus the technique of  @xcite can be used in order to obtain a complete classification of all gqs associated with @xmath2 :    1 .   determine all regular subalgebras @xmath85 of @xmath2 .",
    "if not yet contained in @xmath85 , replace @xmath85 by @xmath88 .",
    "2 .   for each regular subalgebra @xmath85 , determine the decomposition of @xmath2 into simple @xmath85-modules @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "3 .   investigate whether there exists a @xmath3-grading of @xmath2 of the form @xmath91 where each @xmath87 is either directly a module @xmath89 or else a sum of such modules @xmath92 , such that @xmath93 .",
    "if the @xmath3-grading is of the form  ( [ 5grading ] ) with @xmath94 , we shall say that it has _ length _  5 ; if @xmath95 ( then @xmath96 , but @xmath97 ) , then the @xmath3-grading is of length  3 .    to find regular subalgebras",
    "one can use the method of ( extended ) dynkin diagrams  @xcite .",
    "the second stage is straightforward by means of representation theoretical techniques .",
    "the third stage requires most of the work : one must try out all possible combinations of the @xmath85-modules @xmath89 , and see whether it is possible to obtain a grading of the type  ( [ 5grading ] ) . in this process , if one of the simple @xmath85-modules @xmath89 is such that @xmath98 , then it follows that this module should be part of @xmath85 .",
    "in other words , such a case reduces essentially to another case with a larger regular subalgebra .    in the following sections we shall give a summary of the classification process for the basic classical lie superalgebras @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath99 , @xmath7 and @xmath6 .",
    "note that , in order to identify a gqs associated with @xmath2 , it is sufficient to give only the set of caos , or alternatively , to give the subspace @xmath61 ( then the @xmath58 are the root vectors of @xmath61 , and @xmath100 ) .",
    "the set @xmath78 then consist of all quadratic relations ( i.e. the linear relations between the elements @xmath81 ) and all triple relations , and all of these relations follow from the known supercommutation relations in @xmath2 . because , in principle , @xmath78 can be determined from the set @xmath101 , we will not always give it explicitly .",
    "finally , observe that two different sets of caos @xmath102 and @xmath103 ( same @xmath56 ) are said to be isomorphic if , for a certain permutation @xmath104 of @xmath105 , the relations between the elements @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the same . in that case , the regular subalgebra @xmath85 spanned by @xmath108 is isomorphic ( as a lie superalgebra ) to the regular subalgebra spanned by @xmath109 .",
    "let @xmath2 be the special linear lie superalgebra @xmath110 , consisting of traceless @xmath111 matrices .",
    "the cartan subalgebra @xmath86 of @xmath2 is the subspace of diagonal matrices .",
    "the root vectors of @xmath2 are known to be the elements @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) , where @xmath112 is a matrix with zeros everywhere except a 1 on the intersection of row  @xmath114 and column  @xmath115 .",
    "the @xmath46-grading is such that @xmath116 , where @xmath117 the root corresponding to @xmath112 ( @xmath118 ) is given by @xmath119 ; for @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) it is @xmath122 ; and for @xmath123 , resp .",
    "@xmath124 , ( @xmath125 , @xmath126 ) it is @xmath127 , resp .",
    "the anti - involution is such that @xmath129 .",
    "the distinguished set of simple roots and the distinguished dynkin diagram of @xmath4 are given in table  1 , and so is the extended distinguished dynkin diagram .    to find regular subalgebras of @xmath130 , one should delete nodes from the dynkin diagrams of @xmath4 ( first the ordinary , and then the extended ) .",
    "this goes in systematic steps . for each step",
    ", we shall investigate whether it leads to a grading of type  ( [ 5grading ] )",
    ".    * step 1 . *",
    "delete node @xmath131 from the distinguished dynkin diagram .",
    "then the corresponding diagram is the dynkin diagram of @xmath132 for @xmath133 and of @xmath134 for @xmath135 .",

    "* step 11 . * upon deleting three or more nodes from the extended distinguished dynkin diagram of @xmath6 , the corresponding @xmath3-gradings have no longer the required property ( there are non - zero @xmath87 with @xmath192 ) .",
    "the other non - distinguished choices for the simple root systems give no new results .",
    "our analysis has led to a complete classification of all gqs associated with the basic classical lie superalgebras .",
    "some cases in our classification have appeared earlier as examples , e.g.  para - bose statistics  ( [ b021 ] ) , @xmath32-superstatistics  ( [ a1 ] ) in  @xcite , , and the combined para - bose / para - fermi case  ( [ gb3 ] ) in  @xcite .",
    "some other examples are also rather simple , e.g.  the alternatives to @xmath32-superstatistics in  ( [ a2 ] ) , a statistics with two kind of particles in  ( [ adouble ] ) , and the statistics related to @xmath6 superalgebras  ( [ cs1 ] ) and  ( [ cs2 ] ) .    although the detailed analysis in the previous sections was necessary to present the complete solution , it is convenient to summarize the final results in a table",
    ". table  2 recapitulates the classification of all gqs . from this table",
    ", it follows that many of the earlier cases can be somewhat unified in a simple form , provided one makes use of the common isomorphisms for lie algebras and lie superalgebras ( such as @xmath498 , @xmath499 , @xmath43 , @xmath500 etc . ) . for @xmath4 , there are essentially two distinct cases .",
    "either @xmath172 , in which case the grading has length  3 and @xmath501 is fixed by @xmath85 . or else @xmath502 , in which case the grading has length  5 .",
    "in this second case , there are always three ways of combining the @xmath85-modules in order to give some @xmath61 . for @xmath5",
    ", all the cases are characterized by a @xmath85 of the form @xmath503 .",
    "this includes cases such as @xmath504 , @xmath505 ( step  1 ) , @xmath506 ( step  4 ) and @xmath507 ( step  5 ) .",
    "also the results for the remaining lie superalgebras can be neatly summarized .",
    "note that for @xmath7 ( and for @xmath508 ) there is one @xmath85 which gives rise not only to different possibilities for @xmath61 but even for @xmath56 .    a striking property ,",
    "see table  2 , is that all basic classical lie superalgebras , except @xmath99 , allow a gqs with a grading of length  3 ; in other words , a gqs with supercommuting creation and annihilation operators .",
    "note that a set of caos together with a complete set of relations @xmath78 unambiguously describes the lie superalgebra .",
    "so each case of our classification also gives the description of a lie superalgebra in terms of a number of generators subject to certain relations .",
    "this can also be reformulated in terms of the notion of lie supertriple systems  @xcite .",
    "in fact , in our case the subspace @xmath509 ( i.e.  the subspace spanned by all caos ) is a lie supertriple system for the universal enveloping algebra @xmath510 .    just as in  @xcite , we have dealt only with a mathematical definition of generalized quantum statistics . in order to talk about a quantum statistics in the physical sense",
    ", one should take into account additional requirements for the caos , related to certain quantization postulates  @xcite .",
    "these conditions are related to the existence of state spaces ( fock spaces ) , in which the caos act in such a way that the corresponding observables are hermitian operators .",
    "we refer to section  vii of  @xcite for a discussion on this .",
    "we hope that some cases of our classification will yield interesting gqs also from this point of view .    as a second application",
    ", we mention the possible solutions of wigner quantum systems  @xcite . roughly speaking ,",
    "the compatibility conditions ( ccs ) to be satisfied by a wigner quantum oscillator system ( see formula ( 3.7 ) in  @xcite ) are written in terms of certain odd operators @xmath511 ; furthermore , these ccs are special triple relations .",
    "so it is of importance to investigate which triple relations @xmath78 of our current classification of gqs could provide special solutions of these ccs .",
    "it is known , for instance , that there is a @xmath31 solution  @xcite-@xcite or a @xmath512 solution  @xcite . obviously , for a possible candidate solution all the caos of @xmath78 should be odd operators .",
    "let us briefly describe the gqss of the current classification which have only odd caos . then @xmath61 and @xmath60 are odd subspaces , and by the grading condition it follows automatically that the gqs grading  ( [ 5grading ] ) is _ consistent _ with the @xmath46-grading .",
    "so our problem reduces to selecting those gqs from our classification with a consistent @xmath3-grading .",
    "this is not too difficult .    for @xmath4",
    ", one can consider @xmath513 in step  1 .",
    "then all elements of @xmath61 in  ( [ exa1 ] ) are odd ; @xmath514 , and the grading has length  3 ( the case @xmath146 corresponds to  @xcite , @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , one can consider the cases @xmath515 or @xmath516 ( @xmath169 ) of step  2 . in the case",
    "@xmath515 , the elements of @xmath61 given by  ( [ a23 ] ) are all odd , and @xmath517 . in the case",
    "@xmath516 , the elements of @xmath61 given by  ( [ a22 ] ) are all odd , and @xmath518 with @xmath519 . for @xmath5 ,",
    "the case @xmath267 in step  1 leads to a @xmath61 with only odd elements in  ( [ b21 ] ) .",
    "note that in this case @xmath520 . for @xmath99 , this corresponds to taking @xmath267 in step  1 , so that @xmath61 in  ( [ b021 ] ) has odd elements only and @xmath521 ( this is the para - bose case ) .",
    "for @xmath7 , the case @xmath267 in step  1 leads to a @xmath61 in  ( [ d21 ] ) with odd elements only , and with @xmath348 .",
    "there is a second solution here , namely the case @xmath267 in step  11 ; then @xmath61 , given by  ( [ d11 ] ) , has odd elements only , and @xmath522 .",
    "finally , for @xmath6 the solution provided in step  1 has only odd elements for @xmath61 , see  ( [ c1 ] ) , with @xmath523 . also here",
    "there is a second solution , given in step  5 with @xmath61 of the form  ( [ c5.2 ] ) and @xmath464 . to conclude",
    ", all the basic classical lie superalgebras have gqss with odd caos only . whether all these cases provide special solutions to the ccs of the wigner quantum oscillator",
    "will be treated elsewhere .",
