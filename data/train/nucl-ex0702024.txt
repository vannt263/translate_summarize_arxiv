    "a nonzero permanent electric dipole moment ( edm ) of a nondegenerate state of a system with spin @xmath0 violates the invariance under time reversal as well as the invariance under parity operation .",
    "the violation of time reversal invariance implies a violation of invariance under @xmath1 operation ( combined operations of parity and charge conjugation ) through the @xmath2 theorem .    within the standard model ( sm ) , in the electroweak sector @xmath1 symmetry is broken by the complex phase ( @xmath3 ) in the ckm quark mixing matrix ( the km mechanism ) . to date , in laboratory measurements @xmath1 violation has only been observed in @xmath4 and @xmath5 meson decays and the sm description of the @xmath1 violation agrees with all the laboratory measurements to date .",
    "however , the question remains whether or not there are additional sources of @xmath1 violation from new physics .",
    "indeed , almost all extensions of the sm imply that there are such additional sources .",
    "moreover , @xmath1 violation is one of the necessary conditions for the matter - antimatter asymmetry observed in the universe , and the sm and its description of @xmath1 violation fail to accommodate the observed asymmetry .",
    "this discrepancy suggests that there are additional sources of @xmath1 violation beyond that in the sm .",
    "the current efforts to search for an electric dipole moment ( edm ) of the neutron are motivated by the following two observations , which make the neutron edm ( as well as the edm of other particles ) an ideal place to search for new sources of @xmath1 violation :    1 .   in the km mechanism ,",
    "@xmath1 violation only occurs in quark flavor changing processes to the lowest order .",
    "therefore , the edm due to this sm source of @xmath1 violation is small ; calculations predict it to be @xmath6  @xmath7 cm , several orders of magnitude smaller than the sensitivity possible with any experiment being considered at present .",
    "2 .   most extensions of the sm naturally produce larger edms because of additional @xmath1 violating phases associated with additional particles introduced in the model .",
    "furthermore , the sm has another source of @xmath1 violation .",
    "this is a term in the qcd lagrangian , the so - called @xmath8 term , @xmath9 which explicitly violates @xmath1 symmetry because of the appearance of the product of the gluonic field operator @xmath10 and its dual @xmath11 . since @xmath10 couples to quarks but does not induce flavor change , @xmath12 is much more sensitive to @xmath8 than it is to @xmath13 .",
    "thus measurement of @xmath12 determines an important parameter of the sm .",
    "calculations have shown that @xmath14  @xmath7 cm  @xcite . the observed limit on @xmath12  @xcite provide a limit @xmath15 .",
    "a similar limit can be obtained from the observed limit on the edm of the @xmath16hg atom  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the natural scale suggests rather that @xmath17 .",
    "the puzzle of why the value for @xmath8 is so small is called the strong @xmath1 problem .",
    "peccei and quinn proposed a solution to this problem , in which the strong @xmath1 is a conserved quantity .",
    "this solution , however , predicts the existence of a light pseudoscalar , called the axion .",
    "no axions have yet been observed despite extensive searches .",
    "it is important to establish experimentally if @xmath8 has a very small but finite value or @xmath8 is zero in order to shed light on this problem .",
    "the current upper limit on the neutron edm @xmath12 comes from a measurement performed at institut laue langevin ( ill )  @xcite and is @xmath18  @xmath19  cm ( 90% c.l . ) . with many theories predicting values lying within the six orders - of - magnitude window between the current limit and the value allowed by the sm , neutron edm experiments that explore",
    "the next two orders of magnitude would make a significant contribution to the search for new physics that complements the information to be gained from the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "we are currently developing a new neutron edm experiment ( the nedm experiment )  @xcite .",
    "this experiment , which will be run at the 8.9    neutron line at the fundamental neutron physics beamline ( fnpb ) at the spallation neutron source ( sns ) at the oak ridge national laboratory , will search for the neutron edm with a sensitivity two orders of magnitude better than the present limit .",
    "a non - zero edm will be a clear signal of physics beyond the sm , while a two - order - of - magnitude improvement on the limit will provide a significant challenge to many of the models of extensions of the sm .",
    "in the presence of a nonzero edm , there is an interaction between the edm and a static electric field that is analogous to the interaction between the magnetic moment and a static magnetic field .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the applied static magnetic and electric fields , @xmath23 is the magnetic moment , and @xmath24 is the edm of the neutron .",
    "the @xmath25 interaction causes the neutron spin to precess when a neutron is placed in a static electric field , just like the @xmath26 interaction does when the neutron is subject to a static magnetic field .",
    "therefore , the edm can be measured by looking for the change in spin precession frequency of the neutron associated with a reversal of @xmath22 relative to @xmath21 .",
    "more specifically , the value of the edm is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the planck constant , @xmath29 is the change in the precession frequency associated with a reversal of @xmath22 relative to @xmath21 , and @xmath30 is the strength of the applied static electric field .    in a typical experimental arrangement ,",
    "a sample of polarized neutrons is introduced into a volume where uniform magnetic and electric fields are applied , and the neutrons are let precess for a certain amount of time . in such experiments based on spin precession measurements , the statistical uncertainty ( @xmath31 )",
    "is ultimately given by the uncertainty principle and is  @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the time for which the neutron spin is let precess , and @xmath34 represents the number of separate complete measurements of the @xmath35 neutrons .    for experiments in which stored ultracold neutrons ( ucns ) presented by a material boundary .",
    "these neutrons , therefore , can be confined in a material bottle .",
    "typically @xmath36  nev , which corresponds to velocities of order 5  m / s , wavelengths of order 500   and an effective temperature of order 2  mk .",
    "see , for example ref .",
    "@xcite ] are used , where @xmath35 neutrons are stored for a time @xmath37 , in a given total time @xmath38 the number of measurements @xmath34 is inversely proportional to the storage time @xmath37 ( @xmath39 ) . therefore , @xmath40 it is therefore obvious that in designing an edm experiment , it is important to maximize @xmath30 , @xmath35,and @xmath37 . in the most recent ill experiment  @xcite , @xmath41",
    "kv / cm , @xmath42  s , and @xmath43 .    in the nedm experiment",
    "we intend to achieve a two orders of magnitude in sensitivity by adopting the method proposed by golub and lamoreaux  @xcite , which is qualitatively different from the methods adopted in previous experiments ( for the history of neutron edm experiments , see for example ref .",
    "the overall strategy can be summarized as follows :    * the experiment is performed in a bath of superfluid @xmath44he .",
    "* ucns are produced locally in the measurement cells via the downscattering of 8.9    cold neutrons in the superfluid helium ( superthermal process ) . * a dilute admixture of polarized @xmath45he atoms is introduced in the bath of superfluid @xmath44he and is used as the co - magnetometer . *",
    "the polarized @xmath45he atoms are also used as the neutron spin analyzer ; by observing the spin - dependent @xmath46 reaction , the difference between the neutron and @xmath45he precession frequencies can be measured . * the @xmath45he precession frequency",
    "is determined by directly measuring the change in the magnetic field caused by the rotating magnetization of the @xmath45he atoms using squid magnetometers .    with this strategy",
    ", we expect to achieve @xmath47  kv / cm , @xmath48  s , and @xmath49 , resulting in a two - orders - of - magnitude improvement in sensitivity .",
    "some of the important features of this strategy will be described in more details below .      in previous edm experiments with stored ucns ,",
    "ucns produced elsewhere were transported to the experimental apparatus and were stored in the measurement cells .",
    "the number of ucns suffer from the loss in the extraction of ucns from the ucn source and during the transport from the source to the experiment .",
    "these problems can be overcome if ucns can be generated directly in the edm measurement cell .",
    "it is in fact possible using the superthermal process  @xcite in superfluid liquid @xmath44he with 8.9    neutrons delivered to the measurement cell .",
    "this mechanism is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : superthermal ] . shown in the figure",
    "are the dispersion curve of the elementary excitation in superfluid @xmath44he and that of the free neutron , which cross at @xmath50 and @xmath51 , which corresponds to a neutron wavelength of 8.9    or an energy of 12  k. therefore , neutrons with a wavelength of 8.9    can give all their energy and momentum to the elementary excitations in superfluid helium and become ultracold neutrons .",
    "this process is called `` downscattering . ''",
    "the reverse process `` upscattering '' is highly suppressed , because there are hardly any elementary excitations with energy of @xmath52  k ( @xmath51 ) when the temperature of the liquid helium is @xmath53  k ( suppressed by @xmath54 ) . the production of ucns using this method has been experimentally demonstrated  @xcite .    he ( blue ) and the dispersion curve for the free neutron ( red ) .",
    "the two curves cross at @xmath50 and @xmath51 , which corresponds to a neutron wavelength of 8.9    or an energy of 12 k.,width=226 ]    since @xmath44he has zero neutron absorption , ucn can be store in the bath of superfluid @xmath44he until @xmath55 decay , wall absorption , or upscattering occurs .",
    "our goal is to achieve a 500  s lifetime for the stored ucns . with this and the expected neutron flux at the 8.9  line at fnpb ( see sec  [ sec : fnpb ] ) , we expect to have @xmath49 per measurement .",
    "we plan to use a beam of polarized neutrons to generate ucns polarized .",
    "there are other advantages to performing an edm experiment directly in a bath of liquid helium .",
    "a dilute admixture of polarized @xmath45he atoms can be introduced into the bath , and can serve as a comagnetometer and neutron spin analyzer as we will see below .",
    "in addition , because of the excellent dielectric properties of liquid helium , it is expected that a higher electric field can be applied in liquid helium than in vacuum .",
    "an edm of @xmath56  @xmath57 cm would produce a relative change of @xmath58  hz in precession frequency on reversal of @xmath22 with respect to @xmath21 for @xmath59  kv / cm .",
    "this frequency shift corresponds to a change in magnetic field of about @xmath60  gauss .",
    "obviously extreme care needs to be taken to ensure and monitor the temporal stability and spatial uniformity of the magnetic field in order to minimize any possible systematic effects .",
    "we will use polarized @xmath45he atoms as comagnetometer as a means to address this issue .. a comagnetometer is a polarized atomic species within the same storage volume as the neutrons , which provides a nearly exact spatial and temporal average of the magnetic field affecting the neutrons over the storage period .",
    "the effectiveness and importance of the use of comagnetometer have recently been demonstrated experimentally in the ill experiment  @xcite .",
    "we will introduce a dilute admixture of polarized @xmath45he atoms into the superfluid @xmath44he .",
    "the fractional density of @xmath45he will be @xmath61 ( this is determined from the neutron lifetime in the helium bath , as discussed below ) .",
    "@xmath45he is a diamagnetic atom and the edm of @xmath45he is negligible due to the shielding from the two bound electrons .",
    "the precession of @xmath45he atoms will be determined by directly measuring the change in the magnetic field caused by the rotating magnetization of the @xmath45he atoms using squid magnetometers .",
    "the @xmath45he atoms also serves as an analyzer of the neutron precession frequency .",
    "the cross section for neutron absorption by @xmath45he is strongly spin dependent : 59  b for spins aligned and 11  kb for spins opposite at thermal neutron energy ( 25.3  mev ) . the cross sections for both scale",
    "inversely with neutron velocity .",
    "thus if the @xmath45he concentration is adjusted to @xmath62  atoms / cc ( @xmath63 ) , then the neutrons are only absorbed when the neutron spin is opposite to the @xmath45he spin .",
    "therefore the rate of neutron absorption on @xmath45he is proportional to @xmath64,\\ ] ] where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the polarizations of the @xmath45he and the neutrons respectively , and @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the gyromagnetic ratios of the @xmath45he and the neutrons respectively .",
    "when a neutron is absorbed on a @xmath45he atom , the reaction products are a proton and a triton that share 764  kev of energy . when the reaction products travel in liquid helium , they produce scintillation light in the hard ultraviolet ( @xmath69  nm ) .",
    "if the measurement cells are coated with a wavelength shifter , the scintillation light is converted to the blue which may be detected by photomultiplier tubes ( pmt ) .    by measuring the rate of scintillation light",
    ", the difference between the neutron precession frequency and the @xmath45he precession frequency can be determined .",
    "note that the @xmath45he precession frequency is measured using the squid magnetometer .",
    "the signature of a neutron edm would appear as shift in the neutron@xmath70he precession frequency difference corresponding to the reversal of the @xmath22 relative to @xmath21 with no corresponding change in @xmath45he precession .",
    "in addition to the use of squid magnetometer to monitor the polarized @xmath45he , the so - called `` dressed - spin technique '' can be used to look for the signature of the neutron edm .",
    "this is based on the fact that in the presense of a strong oscillating magnetic field , the magnetic moment of a particle is modified or `` dressed '' , yielding an effective gyromagnetic ratio given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the unperturbed gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the amplitude and frequency of the applied oscillating magnetic rf field , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 is the zero - th order bessel function .",
    "thus by applying an rf field perpendicular to the static @xmath77 field that satisfies @xmath78 the neutrons and @xmath45he atoms can be made to precess at the same frequency ( the subscripts @xmath79 and @xmath80 refer to the neutrons and the @xmath45he atoms respectively ) .",
    "this condition is called `` critical dressing . '' in practice , one adjusts the dressing rf field parameter @xmath81 by eliminating the oscillating component of the scintillation light .",
    "the signature of a neutron edm would appear as the change in @xmath81 for critical dressing corresponding to the reversal of the @xmath22 relative to @xmath21 .",
    "an edm experiment insensitive to background magnetic field can thus be performed .      to summarize the method described above , a proposed measurement cycle",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : measurementcycle ] .",
    "note that the duration of each step remains to be optimized to achieve maximal sensitivity once the ucn storage and @xmath45he relaxation times in the measurement cell are known .",
    "he relaxation times in the measurement cell is known.,width=415 ]",
    "the experiment will be performed at the fundamental neutron physics beamline ( fnpb ) at the spallation neutron source ( sns ) at the oak ridge national laboratory .",
    "the spallation neutron source ( sns ) , currently under construction at the oak ridge national laboratory , is an accelerator - based neutron source , and will provide the world s most intense pulsed neutron beams for scientific research and industrial development  @xcite .",
    "the fundamental neutron physics beamline ( fnpb ) , one of the 24 neutron beamlines in the sns target hall , is dedicated to fundamental physics using cold and ultracold neutrons .",

    "the 8.9    line is dedicated to experiments that will uses the superthermal process in superfluid liquid helium to produce ultra - cold neutrons .",
    "the 8.9    neutrons will be selected by a double crystal monochromator and will be sent to an external building located about 30  m downstream , where the nedm experiment will be mounted .",

    "the cells are made of acrylic , and the inner walls are coated with deuterated polystyrene to minimize neutron absorption by hydrogen . the deuterated polystyrene is loaded with deuterated tetraphenyl butadinene ( dtpb ) which serve as the wavelength shifter for the hard ultraviolet scintillation light from the neutron absorption on @xmath45he .",
    "the converted light is guided through the light guides and is detected by pmts .",
