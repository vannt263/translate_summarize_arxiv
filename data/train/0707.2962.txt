    "optical and near - ir imaging has revealed that most luminous and ultra - luminous infrared galaxies , as well as many lower luminosity dusty galaxies ( e.g. starbursts and agns ) , are interacting systems which have recently merged or are in the process of merging @xcite .",
    "large quantities of gas and dust driven into the nascent nuclei of these systems catalyze massive bursts of star formation and/or fuel accretion onto supermassive black holes @xcite .",
    "ultraviolet and optical emission from many of these dusty galaxies is significantly obscured by the same gas and dust providing their infrared power  a fact which greatly complicates the process of diagnosing the star - formation and accretion contributions to their bolometric luminosities .",
    "lirgs and ulirgs are believed to be the largest contributors to the far - ir background and star - formation energy density at @xmath2@xmath3 @xcite , and local ulirgs are frequently used as analogues for the luminous sub - mm galaxy population .",
    "the development of a proper understanding of the histories of star - formation and galaxy evolution in the universe therefore requires the construction of robust and reliable methods for use in diagnosing the dominant luminosity source in obscured dusty galactic nuclei .",
    "great progress towards this goal was made using data from the _ infrared space observatory_(_iso _ ) .",
    "diagnostic diagrams based upon high - ionization mid - ir lines ( e.g. [ ] and [ ] ) , the slope of the mid - ir continuum , as well as the strengths of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 pah emission features were constructed to quantify the relative contributions from accretion and starburst activity in many sources .",
    "these observations provided evidence that ulirgs are powered primarily by star - formation , with the fraction of agn activity increasing with bolometric luminosity . however , due to the limited wavelength coverage and sensitivity of the _ iso _  spectrometers , this analysis was limited to a relatively small number of bright nearby sources .",
    "these observational challenges have largely been abated with the improved wavelength baseline and sensitivity of the infrared spectrograph ( irs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the _ spitzer space telescope_@xcite .",
    "large samples of starburst galaxies @xcite , agns @xcite , local ulirgs @xcite , and their high - redshift counterparts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been observed with the irs . as with the previous generation of studies with _ iso _ , diagnostic diagrams have been constructed using the properties of high - ionization lines ( with much improved sensitivity to place strict limits on [ ] emission ) , mid - ir spectral slopes ( with a much broader mid - ir wavelength baseline ) , and pah feature emission ( now detected to @xmath6 ) .",
    "in addition to these observational diagnostics , many tools have been developed to model the seds of emission from dusty galaxies .",
    "models containing a variety of grains - sizes and chemical compositions have been used to calculate the spectrum of emission from astronomical dust embedded in single and multiple ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) incident radiation fields .",
    "additionally , numerous radiative - transfer models have been published , including several to calculate the emission from an agn and its obscuring torus .",
    "finally , methods intended to decompose the seds of galaxies into a number of components have also been developed .",
    "for example , present such a method and use it to decompose the far - ir seds of a sample of ulirgs into contributions from several dust - modified blackbodies at different characteristic temperatures .",
    "we present in this work a new method used to decompose the seds of galaxies into emission from populations of stars , an agn accretion disk , pah molecules , atomic and molecular lines , and distributions of thermally heated graphite and silicate grains at different fitted characteristic temperatures . given the many observational and theoretical techniques to study dusty galactic nuclei described above , it is fair to question our decision to introduce yet another .",
    "we are motivated to do so for two principal reasons .",
    "first , while the radiative - transfer methods incorporating realistic dust models described above provide the most physically complete method of calculating the seds of dusty galaxies , these methods are also the most dependent on the assumed geometry of the source .",
    "unfortunately , detailed spatial information to constrain these assumptions is available for only a handful of nearby galaxies , so the parameter space in which to search for best - fitting models in agreement with observations is both sizable and degenerate .",
    "second , the methods for calculating the emission from dusty galaxies described above are primarily intended to model starburst galaxies _ or _ agns .",
    "none of them , however , is particularly well - suited to calculating the emission from sources containing a starburst _ and _ an agn , each of which may be extinguished by different levels of obscuration ( see  [ sec : comparisonwithothermethods ] for an expanded discussion ) .",
    "our goal for this paper is therefore to convince the reader that our decomposition method is well - suited to analyzing the seds of composite sources , and is motivated by the desire to address : ( 1 ) what energy source is primarily responsible for powering the emission from dusty galaxies ? ( 2 ) how homogeneous are the seds of dusty galaxies which have similar agn and starburst fractions ? and ( 3 ) what geometries can explain any inhomogeneities in the seds of similarly powered dusty galaxies ? to meet this goal we apply our decomposition method to a small sample of well - studied galaxies , including the relatively unextinguished starburst ngc7714 , the obscured starburst ngc2623 , the quasar pg0804 + 761 , and the seyfert 2 mrk463 .",
    "these fits provide templates by which to understand the properties of pure starburst galaxies and agns  the constituents of composite sources such as many ulirgs . additionally , as examples of such composite sources , we present fits to the lirg ngc6240 ( believed to be powered primarily by star - formation ) and the ulirg mrk1014 ( believed to be powered primarily by accretion ) .",
    "we begin in  [ sec : spectraldecomposition ] with an overview of the spectral decomposition method . in  [ sec : sourceemission ] we detail the method used to calculate the spectrum of emission from the various source components . in ",
    "[ sec : dustmodel ] and  [ sec : dustemission ] we describe the adopted dust model and the method used to calculate the thermal emission from dust . in ",
    "[ sec : pahemission ] and  [ sec : lineemission ] we describe pah feature and atomic and molecular line emission , respectively . in  [ sec : constructingdustyseds ] we describe the sample of galaxies analyzed in this work , in  [ sec : decomposingdustygalaxies ] we present their decompositions , and in  [ sec : discussion ] we present detailed analysis of the results .",
    "the breadth of our conclusions are clearly limited by the size of our sample . in a subsequent paper",
    "our method will be applied to a much larger sample of starburst galaxies , agns , lirgs , and ulirgs obtained as part of the _ spitzer _  gto program .",
    "[ sec : spectraldecomposition ]      the principal assumption in our decomposition method is that the ultraviolet to millimeter wavelength ( @xmath7@xmath8 ) sed of a dusty galaxy may be completely described in terms of emission from evolved stars in the disk of the host galaxy ( _ isrf _ ) , populations of young stars in starbursts ( _ sb _ ) , an agn accretion disk ( _ agn _ ) , pah molecules ( _ pahs _ ) , atomic and molecular lines ( _ lines _ ) , and several distributions of thermally heated graphite and silicate grains ( _ hot _ , _ warm _ , _ cool _ , and _ cold _ ) . in this paper",
    "the _ isrf _ , _ sb _ , and _ agn _",
    "components are collectively referred to as ` source ' emission components since they represent the primary illuminating sources heating dust within a galaxy .",
    "the _ hot _ , _ warm _ , _ cool _ , and _ cold _  components are collectively referred to as ` dust ' emission components . assuming these components form a complete basis describing the emission from dusty galaxies , the observed flux density may be expressed as units may be substituted for @xmath9 units throughout this work and that variables accented with tildes are free parameters in the fitting . ]",
    "@xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the total apparent luminosities of the source and dust components derived from the fit , @xmath13 is the luminosity distance to the galaxy , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the fitted contributions to the total source and dust luminosities from each component , the @xmath16 are the normalized flux densities of each source or dust component , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the fitted pah and emission line flux densities .",
    "we include a maximum of four dust components which are typically heated to characteristic temperatures of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "the actual temperature of each dust component is determined from the fitted magnitude of its illuminating radiation field energy density .",
    "figure  [ fig : galaxymodel ] presents an illustration of one possible geometric structure of a dusty galaxy within which to interpret the roles played by each decomposition component in equation  ( [ eq : totalflux ] ) .",
    "panel ( a ) depicts the optically - thin ( at mid - ir wavelengths ) disk of the host galaxy from which evolved photospheric ( _ isrf _ ) and _ cold _  dust emission emerges .",
    "panel ( b ) shows an enlarged view of the central region of the galaxy consisting of an agn and a starburst surrounded by screens of _ cool_and _ cold _  dust .",
    "panel ( c ) depicts the composite nucleus of the dusty galaxy , while the details of each nuclear component are shown in panel ( d ) .",
    "the starburst is composed of _ sb _  emission from young stars , _ warm_dust in the shells surrounding the young stars , and possibly _ cool _  and/or _ cold _  dust in spherical screens around each individual star - forming cloud .",
    "the agn consists of emission from the _ agn _  accretion disk , _ hot _  and _ warm_dust on the illuminated and shaded sides of the dust clouds creating the obscuring torus ( or dust in illuminated and shielded regions of a ` classic ' torus with a smooth dust distribution ",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : sourcemodel ] ) , and _ warm _  and _ cool",
    "_  dust in narrow - line - region clouds ( again from dust in illuminated and shaded regions ) .",
    "we emphasize that our method does not require the definition of _ any _ specific geometry ( i.e. we derive the contributions from each emission component without the need to define its proximity to any other component ) , and the actual geometry of a dusty galaxy may look quite different from the one presented .",
    "the illustration in figure  [ fig : galaxymodel ] should therefore not be taken as a literal description of the geometry of a particular galaxy ( since our method requires none ) , but instead is intended to provide a structure within which to visualize the multiple roles potentially played by each decomposition component .",
    "we note that star - formation in the disk of the host galaxy and in starburst regions are both explicitly accounted for via the _ isrf _  and _ sb_components . furthermore , while figure  [ fig : galaxymodel ] depicts the specific case of a nuclear starburst , the actual location of the star - formation ( e.g. nuclear versus off - center ) has no effect on the decomposition ( assuming that any off - center emission is contained within the spectroscopic slits and photometric apertures used to construct the seds ) .",
    "for example , in the decomposition of an off - center starburst , the _ cool _  and _ cold _  decomposition components ( or portions thereof ) could be interpreted as belonging to off - center obscuring clouds .",
    "note , however , that if a galaxy contains both a highly - enshrouded nuclear starburst and a less - enshrouded off - center starburst , our decomposition method can not explicitly fit both components simultaneously .",
    "instead , a mean optical depth somewhere between the optical depths of the two individual components is obtained .",
    "thus , care must be taken when interpreting the optical depths inferred from a globally integrated sed ( this admonishment is not unique to our analysis , but is a general statement about the nature of spatially integrated data ) .      once assembled , the ultraviolet to millimeter wavelength seds of the galaxies in our sample are fit to the model of the total flux density from equation  ( [ eq : totalflux ] ) .",
    "the best - fit parameters are determined using a levenberg - marquardt least - squares routine to minimize @xmath23 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where the @xmath24 are the weights applied at each wavelength @xmath25 ( see  [ sec : dataweighting ] ) , @xmath26 is the observed flux density , and @xmath27 is the modeled flux density from equation  ( [ eq : totalflux ] ) . for photometric data , we integrate the modeled flux density over the filter transmission curve ( if available ) to properly calculate the broadband flux density .",
    "this is important for photometric bands containing emission and absorption features ( e.g. l - band photometry containing the @xmath28 pah , @xmath29 water - ice , and @xmath30 hac features  see  [ sec : iceopacity ] and  [ sec : pahemission ] ) , as well as those bands covering spectral regions that change rapidly with wavelength ( e.g. j - band photometry sampling extinguished photospheric emission  see the near - ir fit to ngc6240 in  [ sec : spectraldecompositions ] ) .",
    "experience has taught us that the greater the number of free parameters in a fitting model , the less likely the resulting ` best - fit ' will converge to the desired global minimum in the @xmath31 function .",
    "correspondingly , it becomes increasingly likely that the fit will converge to a local minimum , often with very unsatisfactory results .",
    "this is a practical matter and not a mathematical one since a fit with any number of parameters will reach the global minimum given sufficiently well - chosen initial conditions . in practice , however , it is desirable to have a more robust fitting method such that any _ reasonably _ chosen initial conditions will converge to the global minimum . to meet this goal ,",
    "we have developed an algorithm which separates the processes of fitting the continuum  defined as the sum of the source and dust components  and the individual pah features and atomic and molecular emission lines .",
    "such a division into two separate least - squares processes greatly reduces the total number of free parameters in each fit .",
    "parameter errors are calculated after the first step of the fitting procedure and propagated through to the following fit ( see  [ sec : dataweighting ] ) , so that the net accumulated uncertainty is reliably calculated .",
    "after an sed has been fit , we perform a series of tests to ensure that all components are well - constrained ( i.e. that the parameter errors are smaller than their values ) . first , if the _ isrf _",
    "luminosity is @xmath32% the sum of the luminosities of all source components , then the fit is repeated without the _ isrf _  component .",
    "similarly , if any of the observed dust component luminosities are @xmath32% the sum of the apparent luminosities of all dust components , the fit is repeated without those components .",
    "all three source components and the _ hot _  dust component emit strongly at ultraviolet to near - ir wavelengths . for some galaxies these overlapping emission components are degenerate and result in unconstrained parameters .",
    "our second check is therefore to test if either the _ sb _  or _ agn _  components are unconstrained ( i.e. if their luminosity uncertainties exceed their luminosities ) .",
    "if the _ sb _",
    "component is unconstrained , we fix the _",
    "sb_-to-_pahs _  luminosity ratio ( i.e. the ratio of the unextinguished _ sb _  luminosity to the _ pahs _  luminosity  see  [ sec : decompositionparametersandconstraints ] ) to the value derived from fits to the template starbursts ngc7714 and ngc2623 , and restart the fit .",
    "similarly , if the _ agn _  component is unconstrained , we fix the _ agn_-to-_hot _  dust luminosity ratio ( i.e. the ratio of the unextinguished _ agn _  luminosity to the unextinguished _ hot _",
    "dust luminosity ",
    "see  [ sec : decompositionparametersandconstraints ] ) to the value derived from fits to the template agns pg0804 + 761 and mrk463 , and restart the fit . as our final test ,",
    "if any of the fitted optical depths are unconstrained , we fix the most unconstrained to zero and restart the fit .",
    "this sequence provides a well - defined method by which to sequentially impose constraints until a successful fit is obtained .",
    "the steps in the fitting method are therefore : ( 1 ) input the observed sed and the initial estimates of the _ pahs _  and _ lines _  components ( see  [ sec : pahemission ] and  [ sec : lineemission ] ) ; ( 2 ) subtract the initial _ pahs _  and _ lines _",
    "components from the observed sed to create an observed continuum emission spectrum ; ( 3 ) fit this spectrum to obtain the model continuum ; ( 4 ) subtract the model continuum from the observed sed to create an observed pah feature and line emission spectrum ; ( 5 ) fit the individual features in this spectrum ; ( 6 ) perform the sequence of tests to ensure that the fit is well - constrained ; and ( 7 ) if necessary , repeat the fitting process with the constrained components .",
    "the success or failure of a fitting algorithm and the reliability of the results is largely dependent upon the chosen method of weighting the data in equation  ( [ eq : chi2 ] ) .",
    "we adopt the function @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the total @xmath35@xmath36 uncertainty in the flux density at wavelength @xmath25 , and @xmath37 is a term which compensates for non - uniform wavelength sampling ( i.e. ensuring that a region of the sed does not dominate the fit simply because it is sampled more finely ",
    "see appendix  [ app : dataweighting ] ) . the total uncertainty in any observed data is given by the quadratic sum of the statistical and calibration ( i.e. systematic ) uncertainties .",
    "for irs  spectroscopic data , we use the difference of two spectra obtained at different nod positions ( as produced during a typical irs  observation ) to calculate the statistical uncertainties ( see appendix  [ app : irsuncertainties ] for details ) .",
    "carefully extracted low - resolution irs  spectra may still exhibit some residual calibration uncertainties ( e.g. fringes in the long - low modules ) , which we estimate to be @xmath12% of the flux density at any given wavelength .",
    "for photometric data , the total uncertainty is taken to be equal to the quadratic sum of the uncertainties provided in the literature and an absolute calibration uncertainty ( e.g. from scaling to the irs  apertures ) taken to be 5% .",
    "the actual systematic uncertainties in the photometric data are difficult to estimate , although we note that the adopted uncertainties yield reasonable reduced @xmath31 values , so are likely good estimates .    as described in ",
    "[ sec : decompositionalgorithm ] , each decomposition consists of two separate least - squares fits . in the first ( step 3 above ) , the flux density to fit is obtained by subtracting the _ pahs _  and _ lines_components from the observed sed , i.e. @xmath38 .",
    "when a component is subtracted from observed data to create an sed to be fitted , the uncertainty of the subtracted component must be propagated through the analysis .",
    "thus , the total uncertainty input into the least - squares routine for this first fit is @xmath39 . here , @xmath40 is the uncertainty in the observed flux density , while @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the uncertainties in the estimated _ pahs _  and _ lines _  components , respectively . since the estimated strengths of the _ pahs _  and _ lines_components are derived from the observed spectrum , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are dominated by the irs  uncertainties .",
    "we therefore adopt @xmath43 , since the uncertainties in the irsdata on which they depend are already included through @xmath40 . in the second fit ( step 5 above ) , the flux density to fit",
    "is obtained by subtracting the fitted continuum from the observed sed , i.e. @xmath44 , so that the total uncertainty input into the least - squares routine is @xmath45 . here",
    ", @xmath46 is the formal uncertainty in the continuum calculated using the full covariance matrix from the first fit .",
    "we adopt the model of the average interstellar radiation field presented in and @xcite to represent the sed of emission from stars in the disk of a galaxy . in this model , the mean energy density in the solar neighborhood , @xmath47 , is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the planck function per unit frequency and the @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 $ ] are weighting factors for each blackbody component of temperature @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "this model spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig : sourceseds ] , normalized to have unit integrated energy density .",
    "emission from the _ isrf _  decomposition component is assumed to emerge nearly unobscured from a galaxy disk , so that the line - of - sight extinction to the emitting stars is small in the infrared ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the flux density per unit frequency interval of emission from the _ isrf _  component for use in equation  ( [ eq : totalflux ] ) is therefore @xmath57 an example _ isrf _  component sed , @xmath58 , is shown in figure  [ fig : sourceemission ] . displayed alongside the _ isrf _  component is the emission from a @xmath59 blackbody ( characteristic of evolved stars ) scaled to match at @xmath60 .",
    "the two curves are nearly identical at @xmath61 , so that fitting near - ir data with the _ isrf _  component is very similar to fitting it with a @xmath59 blackbody .",
    "in contrast to the modest @xmath11@xmath62 star - formation rate characteristic of emission from the _ isrf _  component , the rates in starbursts are often much higher ( e.g. @xmath63@xmath64 ) , resulting in significantly different stellar populations . in order to properly characterize the spectral properties and bolometric luminosities of these populations , we use starburst99 @xcite to generate seds of instantaneous bursts at different epochs .",
    "we assume a kroupa imf having a @xmath65 power - law in the @xmath66@xmath67 range and a @xmath68 power - law in the @xmath69@xmath70 range .",
    "we further assume padova agb tracks with solar metallicity .",
    "populations of stars in starbursts evolve dramatically during the first 10  myr after a burst . at 4  myr the most massive stars still exist on the main sequence , but by 10  myr all of the photoionizing stars have evolved into supergiants . as shown in figure  [ fig : sourceseds ] , the emission from a starburst 2  myr after a burst emerges almost exclusively at ultraviolet wavelengths .",
    "since we have very little data in this wavelength range for the sources in our sample , we are unable to explicitly constrain the presence or absence of such a population .",
    "in contrast to this , the 10 and 100  myr populations emit a large fraction of their luminosity at optical and longer wavelengths , where our seds are better constrained .",
    "therefore , in order to adequately sample the evolutionary stages in a starburst that we are sensitive to , and to smoothly transition into the evolved population modeled with the _ isrf_component , we create a composite starburst spectrum containing equal contributions from the 10 and 100  myr populations  i.e .",
    "@xmath71 . we note , however , that the omission of an ultraviolet - luminous young stellar population from @xmath72 may result in an underprediction of the total _",
    "sb_luminosity for some sources , perhaps by up to @xmath1@xmath73 if the 2  myr population contributes at the same level as each of the older populations .    unlike emission from the _ isrf _  component",
    ", we assume that _ sb_component emission emerges from regions that may be obscured by screens of dust out to infrared wavelengths .",
    "if the obscuration to the _ sb_component is dominated by dust in the cocoons of material surrounding each star - forming knot , and not by extinction between the various knots , then the majority of the obscuration occurs via a screened geometry .",
    "@xcite use radiative transfer models to show that such a screened geometry is actually required to reproduce the deep @xmath74 silicate features observed in many ulirgs , suggesting that the assumption of a screened geometry is reasonable for highly obscured sources . at lower optical depths ( i.e. @xmath75 ) ,",
    "mixed and screened geometries both give rise to extinctions scaling approximately as @xmath76 , so that the choice between the form of extinction is less critical .",
    "we therefore model the flux density per unit frequency interval of emission from the _ sb _  component as @xmath77 where the optical depth through the obscuring screen to the _ sb_component is given by @xmath78 here , @xmath79 is the screen optical depth to the _ sb _  component at @xmath80 , and @xmath81 is the total dust absorption opacity obtained by subtracting the scattering opacity from the total extinction opacity ( see  [ sec : dustopacity ] ) .",
    "we use the absorption and not the extinction opacity in equation  ( [ eq : starbursttau ] ) since scattering tends to cancel itself out in sufficiently spherical geometries , such as depicted in figure  [ fig : galaxymodel ] ( i.e. light scattered out of the beam along the direct path to the observer is offset by light scattered into the beam along another path ) .",
    "furthermore , the extinction and absorption opacities of dust in our model have similar slopes between @xmath82 and @xmath83 , where the _ sb _  component emits strongly .",
    "since the derived optical depth depends only on the opacity slope and not its absolute value , the omission of scattering has very little effect .",
    "we note , however , that this omission may introduce some uncertainties at @xmath84 , where the scattering opacity is largest .",
    "example 10 and 100  myr seds , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , used to construct the composite _ sb _  model , @xmath87 , are shown in figure  [ fig : sourceemission ] . also shown are example seds obscured by screens of dust with @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .",
    "the spectral properties of radiation emerging from an agn accretion disk depend sensitively upon the assumed geometry of the surrounding obscuring structure  i.e .",
    "the putative torus of agn unification models .",
    "important geometrical factors include the height of the inner edge of the torus , its proximity to the nucleus , the clumpy versus smooth structure of the obscuring medium , and the orientation of the torus with respect to the observer .",
    "radiative - transfer calculations incorporating these geometric properties have been used to construct models of the emission from an agn accretion disk and its obscuring torus . since",
    "our intent in this work is to characterize the general properties of the emergent seds of large samples of galaxies , and not to discern the detailed properties of the obscuring torus in individual sources , such modeling is unnecessary for our purposes .",
    "instead , we adopt an empirical model of the emission from an agn accretion disk and assume that this sed may be extinguished by a foreground screen of dust .",
    "we use the accretion disk model from in which the emergent energy density , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sourceseds ] , is modeled by @xmath91 the flux density per unit frequency interval of emission from the _",
    "agn_component , including an obscuring screen with a non - uniform covering factor , is modeled as @xmath92,\\ ] ] where @xmath93 is the fraction of the accretion disk obscured by a screen of optical depth @xmath94 , with @xmath95 here , @xmath96 is the screen optical depth to the _ agn_component at @xmath80 .",
    "an example unobscured _ agn _  component sed , @xmath97 , is shown in figure  [ fig : sourceemission ] .",
    "also shown are the seds of _ agn _  component emission obscured by a @xmath98 screen , for several values of the screen covering factor @xmath99 .",
    "note that significant ultraviolet and optical emission may still emerge from a highly extinguished accretion disk if the covering factor is less than unity .    in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : galaxymodel ] ,",
    "the agn accretion disk is depicted as being surrounded by an obscuring structure composed of discrete clouds and/or a smooth dusty component .",
    "the covering factor , @xmath99 , may therefore be interpreted as the fraction of the accretion disk covered by this obscuring material ( from the point - of - view of the observer ) , which has an approximate visual band optical depth equal to @xmath96 .",
    "note that the same qualifications regarding the relative importance of scattering and the subsequent uncertainties in the emergent flux density for @xmath84 that were made for the _ sb _  component apply here as well .",
    "since the clumpy torus is by definition not spherically symmetric , we use the full extinction opacity ( including scattering ) in equation  ( [ eq : agntau ] ) . as described for the _ sb _  component , this choice has very little effect on the results since the extinction and absorption opacities have similar slopes from the ultraviolet to the near - ir , where the _ agn _  component emits strongly .",
    "we adopt the grain - size distribution function from ( * ? ? ?",

    "the modified distribution function for graphite and silicate grains takes the form @xmath100_{{\\rm wd01}}\\left(1 - \\exp{\\left[-\\left (            \\frac{a}{a_{-}^i}\\right)^{\\beta_{-}}\\right]}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath101_{{\\rm wd01}}$ ] is the wd01  distribution function for grains with radii satisfying @xmath102 , @xmath103 is the minimum surviving grain - size in a distribution embedded in a radiation field with an energy density of magnitude @xmath104 ( see  [ sec : grainsublimation ] and eq .

    "[ eq : thermalheating ] ] ) , and @xmath105 determines the exponential cutoff rate . in the limit of @xmath106 ,",
    "the exponential provides a sharp cutoff at @xmath107 .",
    "we choose @xmath108 , the same value adopted for the large grain - size exponential cutoff in wd01 .",
    "absorption and extinction efficiencies , @xmath109 and @xmath110 , have been tabulated for graphite and silicate spheres as described in @xcite for wavelengths @xmath111 .",
    "absorption cross sections are calculated using @xmath112 and @xmath113 , with similar expressions for the extinction cross sections @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "graphite and silicate grains sublimate when heated to temperatures above @xmath116 and @xmath117 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the minimum surviving grain - size in a distribution , @xmath118 , is determined by the size of the smallest grain which does not sublimate in the radiation field in which the distribution is embedded .",
    "as the magnitude of the radiation field energy density increases , the grain distribution becomes increasingly depleted of small grains .",
    "a stronger radiation field therefore changes the sed of emission from a distribution of grains both by increasing the temperature of the grains , and by weighing the grain - size distribution function to larger grains .",
    "additionally , due to their lower sublimation temperatures , silicate grains become depleted before graphite grains .",
    "sublimation is one of many physical processes which can set the minimum grain - size within a distribution .",
    "shock waves , sputtering @xcite , and grain - grain collisions @xcite can also influence the minimum grain - size",
    ". however , these other effects are more difficult to model than sublimation , since they require a dynamic model of the region where the grains are located .",
    "we do not consider them further .",

    "if the clouds in each galaxy are similar in size , this suggests that @xmath660 ( i.e. the _ warm _  dust shell from fig .",

    "thus , the different values of @xmath669 are directly related to the higher _ warm _  dust temperature in ngc2623 , which itself is likely directly related to the higher optical depth through the star - forming clouds in that galaxy .",
    "the apparent _ pahs_-to - dust luminosity ratio is a factor @xmath12.5 times lower in ngc2623 than ngc7714 .",
    "we estimate that extinction to the _ pahs_component in ngc2623 reduces its luminosity by a factor 1.4 ( see  [ sec : detaileddescriptions ] ) , so that the unextinguished _ pahs_-to - dust luminosity ratios for the two galaxies differ by a factor 1.8 . with this correction",

    "the _ pahs_-to - dust luminosity ratio of ngc2623 differs by only @xmath130% from that of ngc7714 . recalling",
    "that the the dust luminosity of ngc7714 would increase by @xmath140% if its _ warm _  dust were at the same temperature of the dust in ngc2623 , the _ pahs_-to - dust luminosity ratios of the two galaxies differ by less than 10% .",
    "the differences in the apparent pah emission from our two starburst templates may therefore be understood as resulting from a combination of : ( 1 ) extinction to the pahs , ( 2 ) the geometry of the pah emitting regions , and ( 3 ) the method of normalizing the _ pahs _  component luminosity .",
    "we suggest that the ratio @xmath670 is a somewhat better tracer of the true strength of pah emission than @xmath672 , since it is less affected by temperature effects .",
    "this latter ratio , or a related quantity such as @xmath673 , is often used to quantify the amount of star - formation in galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "given that both our template starbursts are believed to be entirely powered by star - formation , it is clear that there is significant variation in the relative strength of pah emission in pure starbursts .",
    "we therefore caution that great care must be taken when using any of these metrics to derive absolute quantities of star - formation , since both extinction and geometrical effects may result in different ratios for pure starburst galaxies .",
    "if the obscuring dust surrounding an agn accretion disk is arranged in a smooth ( i.e. non - clumpy ) toroidal distribution , then the @xmath13@xmath674 seds of type-1 sources should be dominated by emission from relatively unobscured _ hot _  dust ( since this _ hot _",
    "dust is viewed directly by the observer , with no intervening material from the torus along the line - of - sight to obscure it ) .",
    "if , however , the obscuring structure is instead composed of discrete clouds distributed in a roughly toroidal shape ( i.e. a clumpy torus ) , then _ hot _  dust emission is not expected to emerge unobscured .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : torusmodel ] , the directly illuminated ( and therefore hotter ) faces of clouds in a clumpy torus always point radially towards the nucleus , and therefore away from the observer .",
    "thus , emission from these hot cloud faces , and therefore _ hot _",
    "component emission from such sources , is obscured by cooler dust on the shaded sides of clouds .",

    "while this model with non - uniform coverage does not exactly reproduce the sed from the fully covered model ( in particular at shorter wavelengths ) , it nonetheless produces a very similar spectrum which would also provide an adequate fit to the pg0804 + 761 sed ( with suitable small adjustments to the _ agn _  and _ warm _",
    "components ) .",
    "thus , the sed of _ hot _  component emission from a highly obscured geometry with a few clear lines - of - sight may appear similar to the emission from a fully covered but less obscured geometry .",
    "for a traditional torus made from a smooth dust distribution , _ hot _  dust emission from a face - on source would emerge unobscured with strong silicate emission features ( since there are no shaded sides of clouds to obscure the _ hot _  emission ) .",
    "our decomposition of pg0804 + 761 does not show such strong features from the _ hot _",
    "component , suggesting that its _ hot _  dust , and possibly that of most type-1 sources , may therefore be significantly obscured by the shadowed sides of clumpy torus clouds .",
    "the lower - left panel of figure  [ fig : torusmodel ] depicts the fitted ngc6240 _ hot _",
    "dust component sed ( unobscured in the decomposition ) , along with a model in which @xmath599% of its _ hot _  dust is covered by a screen with @xmath676 and the remainder emerges unobscured . as with pg0804 + 761 , this partially covered model does not precisely reproduce the fitted _ hot_dust component .",
    "it is , however , similar enough to the fitted component to provide a reasonably good fit ( i.e. since the _ hot _  component of ngc6240 contributes in a region with strong contributions from several other components , the small deviations between the two models would not affect the decomposition greatly ) .",
    "the near equivalence of these two models demonstrates that emission from a highly obscured , but only partially covered , geometry may appear quite similar to emission from a fully covered geometry at much lower levels of obscuration .",
    "therefore , despite the small apparent optical depth derived from the fit to ngc6240 , it is possible that the _ hot _",
    "component in this source is actually much more significantly obscured ( i.e. we may only see direct emission from a few clear lines - of - sight , while the majority of the _ hot _  dust is completely obscured ) .",
    "since emission from dust at far - ir ( @xmath677 ) wavelengths is likely to emerge unobscured from galaxies , the average properties of the far - ir seds of agns ( e.g. their relative cold dust luminosities and masses ) should be similar for all sources ( assuming their nuclei are similarly structured ) , independent of their orientation - based ( i.e. type-1 versus type-2 ) classification . as described in ",

    "@xcite use a two - component ( starburst+agn ) template decomposition to conclude that some optically classified agns with strong far - ir emission likely have significant contributions from starbursts .",
    "while this is likely true for many agns with cool far - ir seds , it does not appear to hold for mrk463 ( see  [ sec : detaileddescriptions ] ) .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : agnorientation ] , we instead suggest that the far - ir emission from _ some _ agns ( including mrk463 ) is powered by the agn itself and originates from cool dust in the disk of the host galaxy .",
    "we note here that this suggestion is based upon the seds of only two agns , so further study using a much larger sample ( to be presented in a subsequent paper ) is needed before conclusions are drawn about the origin of far - ir emission from the class of agns .    while it is often assumed that an agn accretion disk and the disk of the galaxy hosting the agn are co - planar ( as in the top of fig .",

    "we therefore perform one final step , smoothing our estimated @xmath36 array with a window of width @xmath709 , and scaling the entire array until it has the expected behavior that the @xmath35@xmath36 error contour envelops 68% of the @xmath713 .          , l. , bernard - salas , j. , spoon , h.  w.  w. , marshall , j.  a. , charmandaris , v. , higdon , s.  j.  u. , desai , v. , hao , l. , teplitz , h.  i. , devost , d. , brandl , b.  r. , soifer , b.  t. , & houck , j.  r. 2006 , , 640 , 204    , l. , charmandaris , v. , bernard - salas , j. , spoon , h.  w.  w. , marshall , j.  a. , higdon , s.  j.  u. , desai , v. , teplitz , h.  i. , hao , l. , devost , d. , brandl , b.  r. , wu , y. , sloan , g.  c. , soifer , b.  t. , houck , j.  r. , & herter , t.  l. 2007 , , 656 , 148    , l. , charmandaris , v. , spoon , h.  w.  w. , houck , j.  r. , soifer , b.  t. , brandl , b.  r. , appleton , p.  n. , teplitz , h.  i. , higdon , s.  j.  u. , weedman , d.  w. , devost , d. , morris , p.  w. , uchida , k.  i. , van cleve , j. , barry , d.  j. , sloan , g.  c. , grillmair , c.  j. , burgdorf , m.  j. , fajardo - acosta , s.  b. , ingalls , j.  g. , higdon , j. , hao , l. , bernard - salas , j. , herter , t. , troeltzsch , j. , unruh , b. , & winghart , m. 2004 , , 154 , 178                , b.  r. , bernard - salas , j. , spoon , h.  w.  w. , devost , d. , sloan , g.  c. , guilles , s. , wu , y. , houck , j.  r. , weedman , d.  w. , armus , l. , appleton , p.  n. , soifer , b.  t. , charmandaris , v. , hao , l. , higdon , j.  a.  m.  s.  j. , & herter , t.  l. 2006 , , 653 , 1129    , b.  r. , devost , d. , higdon , s.  j.  u. , charmandaris , v. , weedman , d. , spoon , h.  w.  w. , herter , t.  l. , hao , l. , bernard - salas , j. , houck , j.  r. , armus , l. , soifer , b.  t. , grillmair , c.  j. , & appleton , p.  n. 2004 , , 154 , 188    , d. , kennicutt , jr .",

    "<S> we present a new multi - component spectral energy distribution ( sed ) decomposition method and use it to analyze the ultraviolet to millimeter wavelength seds of a sample of dusty infrared - luminous galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> seds are constructed from spectroscopic and photometric data obtained with the _ </S>",
    "<S> spitzer space telescope _  in conjunction with photometry from the literature . </S>",
    "<S> each sed is decomposed into emission from populations of stars , an agn accretion disk , pahs , atomic and molecular lines , and distributions of graphite and silicate grains . </S>",
    "<S> decompositions of the seds of the template starburst galaxies ngc7714 and ngc2623 and the template agns pg0804 + 761 and mrk463 provide baseline properties to aid in quantifying the strength of star - formation and accretion in the composite systems ngc6240 and mrk1014 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that obscured radiation from stars is capable of powering the total dust emission from ngc6240 . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a small quantity of @xmath0 dust in this source suggests a @xmath12% agn contribution , although we can not rule out a larger contribution from a deeply embedded agn visible only in x - rays . </S>",
    "<S> the decomposition of mrk1014 is consistent with @xmath165% of its power emerging from an agn and @xmath135% from star - formation . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that many of the variations in our template starburst seds may be explained in terms of the different mean optical depths through the clouds of dust surrounding the young stars within each galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> prompted by the divergent far - ir properties of our template agns , we suggest that variations in the relative orientation of their agn accretion disks with respect to the disks of the galaxies hosting them may result in different amounts of agn - heated cold dust emission emerging from their host galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that 3050% of the far - ir and pah emission from mrk1014 may originate from such agn - heated material in its host galaxy disk . in a subsequent paper </S>",
    "<S> , this decomposition method will be applied to a large sample of dusty galaxy seds to further test the validity of these suggestions . </S>"
