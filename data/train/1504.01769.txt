    "the corresponding reproducing kernels , together with the cardinal sine , are ubiquitous in random matrix theory .",
    "a reason is that the determinantal random point processes given by these kernels ( see below for a definition ) describe the possible asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues from large hermitian matrices , see , for instance , @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "instead of considering determinantal processes , we investigate random point processes whose relation to the cardinal sine , bessel and airy functions is slightly different .",
    "namely , translates of these functions essentially appear as orthonormal bases of reproducing kernels of certain de branges spaces .",
    "we study the point processes obtained by considering the random linear combinations obtained from each of these bases .",
    "these are examples of gaussian analytic functions ( gafs ) .",

    ".    we remark that kolmogorov s inequality shows that , for a fixed @xmath51 , the series ( [ de branges gaf ] ) is almost surely pointwise convergent .",
    "in fact , since @xmath52 converges uniformly for @xmath53 on compact subsets of @xmath54 , it can be proved that the series in almost surely converges uniformly on compact subsets of @xmath54 .",
    "thus , the de branges gaf is an entire function with probability one .    more generally , for a sequence of analytic function @xmath55 defined in a certain region @xmath56 if @xmath57 converges uniformly on compact sets of @xmath58 and @xmath49 are real i.i.d.standard random variables , the series @xmath59 defines an analytic function with probability one .",

    "recall that the covariance kernel , as @xmath62 has mean zero , completely defines the behavior of the process .    by remark [ relationmodel ] above , the random function @xmath66",

    "the de branges reproducing kernels provide some well known examples of determinantal point processes .",
    "these processes have been studied specially in connection to random matrix theory .",
    "more specifically , the cardinal sine kernel describes the distribution of neighbouring eigenvalues in the bulk for the gaussian unitary ensemble , gue @xcite , the airy kernel ( [ airykernel ] ) describes the soft edge of the spectrum for the gue @xcite , while the bessel kernel ( [ besselkernel ] ) represents the hard edge of the spectrum of the jacobi and laguerre ensembles , @xcite .    in the determinantal case , the first intensity function is just given by the diagonal of the kernel , namely @xmath85 . for gafs defined as in with the @xmath49 being complex i.i.d.standard normal variables ,",

    "as we consider real random coefficients , and not complex , the first intensity can not be computed using the expression .",
    "instead , the situation is more similar to the case of real zeroes of random polynomials with real coefficients , studied in @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the case of real random coefficients , the de branges gafs have zeroes which are symmetric with respect to the real line ( recall that the kernel functions are symmetric with respect to the real line ) , and one expects to find a certain proportion of them on the real line . for this reason , with respect to the complex plane , the intensity functions should have a singular part that is supported on the real line .",
    "indeed , this is a consequence of the following formula which was proved in @xcite .",
    "it says that in the distributional sense , the first intensity function satisfies @xmath90      in the following theorem , we give a formula for the first intensity function of de branges gafs in terms of the schwarzian derivative of the phase function @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath91    [ first intensity ] let @xmath4 be a de branges space with phase function @xmath33 . for any choice of orthonormal basis of reproducing kernels , then the first intensity function of the corresponding de branges",

    "we found the appearance of the schwarzian derivative , which is an infinitesimal version of the coss - ratio ( see @xcite ) quite intriguing .",

    ". some properties of this process where studied in @xcite .",
    "below , in section [ example section ] , we will consider examples of de branges spaces given by the airy and bessel functions . here , we state the following lemma which will be used to transfer information of the derivative of the phase function @xmath100 to the first intensity function @xmath93 .",

    "an interesting feature of gafs is that the distribution of the zero set depends just on the first intensity function , as was shown by sodin in @xcite ( see also ( * ? ? ?",

    "the idea is that from ( [ rho1gaf ] ) , it can be shown that the difference between the logarithms of the covariance kernel of two gafs with the same first intensity is an harmonic function .",
    "this implies that the covariance kernels are equal on the complex diagonal , up to a multiplication by a non - vanishing harmonic function . from this , one is able to argue that the kernel functions are essentially equal even off the diagonals , which leads to the desired result . as sodin",

    "a version in the setting of model subspaces was proved by nikolskii , @xcite . in our case , as we are working in a real context , the formula is no longer valid . however , as we show in the following theorem , the first intensity still determines the distribution .",
