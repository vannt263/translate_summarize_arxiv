    "the simplest compactification of a ten - dimensional superstring on a product of an ads space with a five - dimensional spherical manifold leads to an @xmath6 @xmath7 supersymmetric gauge theory , well known to be conformally invariant @xcite . by replacing the manifold @xmath8 by an orbifold @xmath9 one arrives at a theory with less supersymmetries corresponding to @xmath10 , @xmath11 or @xmath12 depending @xcite on whether : ( i ) @xmath13 , ( ii ) @xmath14 but not in @xmath15 , or ( iii ) @xmath16 but not in @xmath17 respectively , where @xmath2 is in all cases a subgroup of @xmath18 , the isometry of the @xmath8 manifold ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "it was conjectured in @xcite that such @xmath7 gauge theories are conformal in the @xmath19 limit . in @xcite",
    "it was conjectured that at least a subset of the resultant nonsupersymmetric @xmath20 theories are conformal even for finite @xmath21 and that one of this subset may provide the correct extension of the standard model .",
    "recently , all @xmath4 and @xmath22 susy models have been classified @xcite that come from orbifolding @xmath23 with an abelian group @xmath2 of order less than @xmath24 , where @xmath2 embeds irreducibly in the @xmath25 isometry or in an @xmath17 subgroup of the @xmath25 isometry , respectively .",
    "this means that , to achieve @xmath4 , @xmath26 of @xmath25 must be embedded as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a nontrivial four dimensional representation of @xmath2 ; for @xmath29 , @xmath26 of @xmath25 must be embedded as @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the trivial singlet of @xmath2 and @xmath28 is nontrivial .",
    "we want to focus on non - supersymmetric pati - salam ( ps ) type models ( for a susy version see @xcite ) .",
    "one motivation for studying the nonsusy case is that the need for supersymmetry is less clear in cft as : ( 1 ) the hierarchy problem is absent or ameliorated , ( 2 ) the difficulties involved in breaking the remaining @xmath29 susy can be avoided if the orbifolding already results in @xmath20 susy , and ( 3 ) many of the positive effects of susy are still present in the theory , although just hidden .",
    "for @xmath4 the fermions are given by @xmath32 and the scalars by @xmath33 where the set @xmath34 runs over all the irreps of @xmath2 .",
    "for @xmath2 abelian , for example @xmath35 , the irreps are all one dimensional and as a consequence of the choice of @xmath21 in the 1/n expansion , the gauge group is @xmath36 @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "starting from the classification of kephart and pas ( 2004 ) , we have searched for a minimal ( respect to the order of @xmath35 ) nonsusy model that have sm particles as a subset of its particle content . to do this",
    "we have used symmetry breaking paths that contain the pati - salam ( ps ) group as a subgroup before reaching the sm .",
    "the minimal model of this type has symmetry group @xmath37 , hence orbifolding group is @xmath38 , as we will discuss .",
    "the running of the coupling constants predicted by the model depends strongly on the scalar content .",
    "in fact , since there are scalars in addition to the usual sm higgs sector , they can contribute to the running of the beta functions .",
    "after a presentation of the model and of the ssb chain that leads to the sm particle content , we show that , with the use of a judicious choice of the scalar sector , unification can be achieved at the scale @xmath39 gev .",
    "we then conclude with a few comments on the phenomenology of the model including proton decay constraints and dark matter .",
    "we have systematically gone through all chiral models with @xmath35 . all fail to have a ps type intermediate stage until @xmath40 hence after considerable exploration , we are lead to choose @xmath41 and @xmath42 with orbifold group embedding @xmath43 .",
    "this yield an @xmath4 susy model based on the gauge group @xmath44 .",
    "the particle spectrum of the unbroken theory at the string scale is given by the fermion states @xmath45   + [ ( 41\\bar{4}1111)_f +    \\cdots ]   + [ ( 411\\bar{4}111)_f     + \\cdots ]    \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and scalars @xmath46   + 4\\left[(411\\bar{4}111)_s +   \\cdots \\;\\right ]   + 4\\left[(4111\\bar{4}11)_s +    \\cdots \\;\\right ]   + 2[(41111\\bar{4}1)_s + \\cdots ]    \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] of @xmath44 , where the dots mean cyclic permutations .",

    "this breaks the symmetry to @xmath56 ( see @xcite for a detailed study of the phenomenology of this model without @xmath57 charge ) and gives three @xmath57 neutral @xmath58 scalars . finally , giving a vev of the form @xmath59 to one of these @xmath58s",

    "this can be accomplished by giving a vev to a scalar in the @xmath76 representation , which leads to the group @xmath77 and three @xmath78 factors .",
    "more precisely this would result in four @xmath78 factors , but one linear combination is broken due to the non - zero @xmath78 charges of @xmath76 .",
    "nevertheless we write these four charge as superscripts in order to fix the normalization later .",
    "+ under the group structure @xmath79 , the scalar state @xmath76 decomposes to @xmath80 , while the scalar state @xmath81 decomposes to @xmath82 .",
    "therefore giving a vev to @xmath83 , @xmath84 and the additional scalar @xmath85 , can break @xmath86 down to @xmath87 , along with a single @xmath78 formed by a linear combination of four @xmath78 factors .",
    "since we are breaking three combinations of four @xmath78 charges we must ensure that there exists a normalization pattern that will result in the remaining @xmath78 being the usual hypercharge of the standard model .",
    "starting from the well know gell mann - nishima relation @xmath88 , with @xmath89 being the electric charge , @xmath90 the third isospin component and @xmath91 the hypercharge , we can choose a suitable normalization of the charges @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 of the form @xmath96 this completes the chain of symmetry breaking reaching the standard model gauge group @xmath97 .",

    "in the previous section , the symmetry breaking of the initial @xmath44 towards to @xmath107 gauge group was performed by allowing the states @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 to obtain vevs .",
