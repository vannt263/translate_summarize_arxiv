    "polymer translocation  passage of a polymer through a pore in a membrane  is a very ubiquitous and vital process in biological environments . in the past decade",
    "it has also been used as a tool for single - molecule studies @xcite .",
    "better understanding of related biological processes , dna sequencing @xcite , examining the existing theories on the statics and dynamics of confined polymers @xcite , direct study of nucleic acid - protein interactions @xcite and nucleic acids secondary structure @xcite are examples of present and potential applications .",
    "as a polymer passes through a pore , the number of its possible conformations and hence its entropy decreases . to overcome this entropic barrier ,",
    "a voltage difference is often applied in the case of charged polymers . during the polymer passage ,",
    "the ion current through the channel is blocked showing that the polymer is inside the channel @xcite .",
    "time length of polymer passage through the pore @xcite , ion current during the polymer passage @xcite and the time interval between consecutive passages ( entry time ) @xcite are three measurable quantities in polymer translocation experiments .",
    "these quantities contain information about the polymer and its interaction with the channel @xcite . despite the two first quantities ,",
    "the polymer entry time into the channel is less investigated .",
    "the entry process of the polymer into the channel may be diffusion- or barrier - limited .",
    "it has been observed in the experiments that the entry time as a function of the inverse of the applied voltage is linear ( exponential ) in diffusion - limited ( barrier - limited ) regime @xcite .",
    "fluorescence microscopy has revealed that in the diffusion - limited regime , there is a region of very low polymer concentration around the channel entrance . in this region ,",
    "the electric field drift dominates over the diffusion and the polymer is carried to the pore in a very short time .",
    "this is continued with immediate passage of the polymer through the pore @xcite . in this regime",
    ", diffusion - convection ( smoluchowski ) equation can explain the behavior of the polymer outside the channel and its flux through the pore very well @xcite .    in the barrier - limited regime ,",
    "the entry process of the polymer into the channel is very time consuming .",
    "the free - energy barrier against the polymer entry into the channel @xcite and the polymer attempt frequency for passing this barrier @xcite are believed as two main quantities determining the entry time @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that in this regime the entry time depends on the polymer length in contrast to the diffusion - limited regime @xcite .",
    "positional distribution of charges on the channel surface , electro - osmotic flow of counterions , interaction of the charges on the polymer with the channel medium which is of low dielectric constant and compression of the cloud of the polymer counterions in the course of polymer passage through the channel have been mentioned as other possible relevant factors @xcite .",
    "enhancement of the frequency of polymer entry is of great interest in polymer translocation experiments .",
    "it provides the possibility of polymer translocation studies in lower salt concentrations @xcite , lower applied voltages @xcite and smaller sample amounts @xcite . for this purpose ,",
    "numerous procedures such as applying a salt gradient across the channel @xcite , charge manipulation of the protein channels by site - directed mutagenesis @xcite and layer deposition on solid state channels @xcite have been used .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the polymer entry time in the barrier - limited regime for two different geometries of the channel entrance .",
    "a simple scaling theory as well as the results of coarse - grained molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations are presented .",
    "we show that the electric field compresses the polymer on the wall before its entry to the channel .",
    "we calculate the free - energy of the polymer in the compressed state and then find the dependence of the height of the free - energy barrier on the polymer length and strength of the electric field for the two geometries of the channel entrance .",
    "results of the theory and the simulation are in good agreement and their correspondence with experimental results is investigated and discussed .",
    "we also study the polymer attempt frequency for crossing the barrier .",
    "our studies show that the squeezing effect of the electric field and the lateral confinement of the polymer prior to its entry to the channel are very important factors in the height of the free - energy barrier and the dynamics of the polymer translocation .",
    "these effects were not taken into account in the previous works .",
    "we also study the polymer entry into an asymmetric channel of @xmath0-hemolysin dimensions and discuss important factors in the entry time and compare our results with related experiments . here , in addition to extension of ref .",
    "@xcite , new results on the polymer entry into an asymmetric channel of the same dimensions as the @xmath0-hemolysin channel and the polymer attempt time for passing the channel are presented .",

    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model and the method of the simulation of polymer entry into an asymmetric channel is discussed in sec .",

    "finally , a brief review of the paper and some final notes are given in sec .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "the @xmath0-hemolysin protein channel has a completely known crystallographic structure .",
    "it is very stable under the effect of the applied voltages and different chemicals .",
    "thanks to such characteristics , this protein channel has been used in many polymer translocation experiments . in these experiments",
    ", it has been observed that the polymer entry time from the trans side of the channel is considerably longer than that of the cis side . for this difference",
    ", three main reasons have been suggested : difference between channel vestibules size and so different entropic barriers against the polymer entry from the two sides , asymmetric distribution of charges on the channel which leads to polymer attraction or repulsion from the bulk @xcite and different projections of the channel relative to the membrane and so entropically easier approach of the polymer to the cis side of the channel @xcite .    to investigate the effect of the difference between the size of channel vestibules , we perform md simulations of electric - field - driven polymer entry into an asymmetric channel of a simple geometry as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in our simulations ,",
    "surfaces of the flat wall containing the channel and the channel itself are constructed by spherical fixed particles of diameter @xmath1 .",
    "the walls are constructed by particles arranged on concentric circles of different radii and the two cylinders forming the channel ( which are of diameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) are made by particles arranged on consecutive circles .",
    "3d shape of the channel in our simulations can be imagined by rotating the schematic shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] around its symmetry axis .",
    "the polymer is modeled as a bead - spring chain .",
    "the beads are of diameter @xmath1 and excluded volume interactions of the monomers with each other and with the walls and the channel are modeled by the shifted and truncated lennard - jones potential , @xmath4 @xmath5 is the distance between the particles . @xmath6 and @xmath1 represent the strength and the length scale of the interaction , respectively and the range of interaction is @xmath7 .",
    "the monomers are connected by the finite extensible nonlinear elastic ( fene ) potential , @xmath8 we set the spring constant and the maximum bond length as @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the equations of motion are integrated with the velocity verlet algorithm with the step size @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the md time scale .",
    "the system is kept at the constant temperature @xmath13 using the langevin thermostat with the damping constant @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "so , hydrodynamic interactions are not included in our model .",
    "it has been shown that consideration of the hydrodynamic interactions in simulation do not change the polymer equilibrium properties considerably . as the entry time is very long in the barrier - limited regime , this system is in a quasi - equilibrium state .",
    "the polymer translocation experiments are often done in @xmath15 concentration of monovalent salt @xcite .",
    "the debye screening length corresponding to such a salt concentration is @xmath16 , which is smaller than the diameter of ssdna , @xmath17 .",
    "accordingly , we assume here that there is no electrostatic interaction between the monomers and they only interact with the applied electric field .",
    "also no counterions or coions are considered in our model .    the electric field effect on the monomers",
    "is modeled by applying the force @xmath18 to all of the monomers .",
    "this force is uniform in space and it is the same for all the monomers .",
    "all the simulations are performed with espresso @xcite .        to measure the polymer entry time into a channel in a wall",
    ", we fix the middle monomer of a polymer consisting of 25 monomer at a close distance from the wall and leave the polymer to equilibrate without any applied electric field .",
    "then we release the fixed monomer and turn on the electric field at the same time , @xmath19 .",
    "the polymer entry time , @xmath20 , is defined as the time at which one of the monomers completely passes the channel . in these simulations , a cylindrical constraint of diameter @xmath21 ( coaxial with the two cylinders forming the channel )",
    "is set around the channel to keep the polymer from diffusing away .",
    "the diameter of this constraint is larger than the radius of gyration of the polymer to avoid any confinement effects .",
    "excluded volume interaction of monomers with this constraint is also given by eq .",
    "[ lj ] .    presence of this constraint is justified by the fact that we are interested in the barrier - limited regime . in this regime ,",
    "the time it takes the polymer to diffuse from the bulk to the channel is much shorter than the time it takes the polymer to enter into the channel .",
    "in fact , we assume that keeping a fluctuating polymer close to the pore by a constraint is equivalent to continuous diffusion of polymers of different configurations from the bulk to the channel vicinity . as a result , to compare entry times obtained from our simulations to experimental ones ,",
    "they should be multiplied by the ratio of diffusion time of the polymers from the bulk to the characteristic time of the polymer reconfiguration .",
    "one can obtain an estimation for this conversion factor .",
    "the characteristic time of polymer reconfiguration in our simulations is given with the rouse time @xmath22 @xcite , in which @xmath23 is equal to the md time scale .",
    "for a polymer with @xmath24 , this time is @xmath25 . for a ssdna with several tens of bases ,",
    "the diffusion coefficient of the polymer is @xmath26 . considering the typical polymer concentrations in the experiments ( @xmath27 ) , the diffusion time of the polymers to the channel is around @xmath28 .",
    "so the factor for converting the simulation times to experimental ones becomes @xmath29 .    to obtain the entry time for",
    "each given set of parameters , averages over 100 - 150 realizations are calculated .",
    "each realization for narrower channels typically takes several hours with our machines .",

    "[ fig2 ] , md simulation result for the entry time of a polymer into a simple cylindrical channel in a wall versus the channel diameter is shown .",
    "region 1 in this figure corresponds to the situation in which the polymer can enter the channel only by one of its ends .",
    "region 2 however , corresponds to the other situation in which entry of the polymer in folded state is also possible .",
    "note that there is a two orders of magnitude difference between polymer entry times in regions 1 and 2 of this figure .",
    "entry in the folded state is impossible when the diameter of the channel is so small that two monomers can not pass the channel simultaneously or the energy barrier for entry in this state is extremely high . in rest of the paper",
    "we only consider channels that their narrow part corresponds to region 1 of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    the polymer entry time , @xmath20 , from cis and trans sides of an asymmetric channel",

    "channel parameters are taken as @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . in the trans side ,",
    "the polymer feels no lateral confinement before its entry to the channel . in the cis side however , the polymer is confined in a wider cylinder before its entry to the channel narrow part . using this geometry of the channel",
    "we can probe how the presence of a wider region before the narrow part of the channel affects the polymer entry time . as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , existence of the wide part in the cis side reduces the polymer entry time relative to the trans side dramatically .",
    "simulation results for a channel of dimensions very close to those of the @xmath0-hemolysin channel , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , are shown in fig . [ fig3](b ) .",
    "order of magnitude of the entry times and the ratio of entry times from the cis and the trans sides are very close to the experiment @xcite . it should be noted that a polymer containing 25 monomers in our simulations is equivalent to a 75-nucleotide ssdna in the experiment . for more details",
    "[ exp - entry ] .",
    "our simulations show that the time - limiting stage in the process of polymer entry from the cis side is the entry from the wide part of the channel ( the part of diameter @xmath2 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) into the narrow part . as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the time needed for entry in the wide part can be ignored .",
    "entry time from both cis and trans sides can be considered as the time it takes one of the polymer ends to come in front of the channel narrow part by thermal fluctuations , @xmath23 , multiplied by inverse of the probability to overcome the free - energy barrier of height @xmath38 .",
    "this is the well known vant hoff - arrhenius law @xcite ,    @xmath39    in situations that the polymer can enter into the channel in folded state , @xmath23 is the characteristic time of polymer fluctuations in front of the channel @xcite . in our case",
    "that only entry of the polymer by one end is possible , @xmath23 is the characteristic time it takes one of the polymer ends to reach the channel entrance .    in our simulations , @xmath23 and @xmath38",
    "are measured separately . to calculate @xmath23 , we block the channel narrow part and let the polymer to equilibrate under the electric field in front of the channel",
    ". then we measure the average of the time interval between consecutive reachings of the polymer ends to the channel .",
    "when one of the end monomers of the polymer falls in a range of distance from the entrance of the channel narrow part , one time for reaching of the polymer ends to the channel is counted .",
    "for the same end of the polymer another reaching is counted only if it leaves the mentioned range and returns back again .",
    "the amount of the equilibration time depends on the polymer length and the electric field strength .",
    "it is longer for longer polymers and weaker electric fields .",
    "we take the equilibration time when the radius of gyration of the polymer gets constant and shows only small fluctuations around the equilibrium value . for every value of @xmath23",
    ", 100 - 150 simulations are performed .    to measure @xmath38 , we fix one of the end monomers of the polymer at the entry of the channel and let the rest of the monomers to equilibrate under the electric field",
    ". then we release the end monomer and probe whether it enters the channel narrow part or returns back .",
    "the logarithm of the probability of successful entry ( ratio of the number of successful entries to the total number of simulations ) equals to @xmath40 .",
    "number of realizations to obtain this quantity is typically @xmath41-@xmath42 in our simulations , depending on the barrier height .    as it is shown in fig .",

    "such large error bars are resulted from the exponential distribution of these quantities ( see the inset of fig . [ fig3](b ) ) . for any variable of exponential distribution",
    ", it is known that the mean and the standard deviation are of the same value .",
    "actually , exponential distribution of entry time originates from the fact that consecutive polymer entries into the channel are independent events @xcite .",
    "in this section , we present a simple scaling theory for the model system introduced in the previous section which will be tested with the simulation results in the next section .",
    "an important point in this theory is that the electric field compresses the polymer to the wall before its entry to the channel .",

    "the electric field tends to move the polymer toward the wall and decrease its electric energy . on the other hand",
    ", entropy resists the polymer confinement in a small volume near the wall .",
    "competition between these two effects determines the polymer layer thickness , @xmath46 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( a ) ) .",
    "actually , the electric field effect on the polymer is similar to the polymer adsorption to the wall , which is modeled with the polymer confinement between two walls @xcite . here , one can introduce the blob size , a length scale in the system smaller than which the polymer has its unperturbed statistics and beyond it , the confinement by the wall dominates .",
    "so , the polymer can be modeled as a 2d chain of blobs of size @xmath46 .",

    "[ fig4 ] ( b ) ) . in this case also , the effect of the electric field is equivalent to confining the polymer between two parallel walls . because of the simultaneous confining effects of the electric field and the cylinder , this situation is similar to a polymer confined in a closed cavity . in this case",
    ", blobs can be defined that inside them the flory statistic governs , @xmath58 .",
    "these blobs are closely packed inside the cavity , @xmath59 . here",
    "@xmath60 and @xmath61 are the blob size and the number of monomers in each blob , respectively , and @xmath62 is the cavity volume @xcite .",
    "these two relations give the number of monomers in each blob @xmath63 , and the polymer free - energy is obtained as @xmath64 .",
    "we obtain the electric energy of the polymer layer , @xmath65 , in both cases with a mean field approximation .",
    "a uniform distribution is assumed for monomers in the layer of thickness @xmath66 @xmath67 .",
    "taking zero of the electric energy on the wall , we obtain @xmath68 .",
    "because of the long entry time , polymer reaches to an equilibrium state before its entry to the channel .",
    "so we can find the thickness of the polymer layer in both cases by minimizing the sum of electric and entropic energies of the polymer , @xmath69 , with respect to @xmath66 : @xmath70    free - energy per monomer before entry to the channel is @xmath71 and the number of monomers in each blob is obtained as @xmath72    consider a polymer in each one of cases @xmath49 and @xmath57 that enters a channel of diameter @xmath3 on the wall .",
    "inside the channel , we take the polymer as a chain of blobs of diameter @xmath3 ( see fig .",

    "entropic energy of each monomer inside the channel is @xmath75 , where @xmath76 .",
    "a chain of @xmath77 monomers has a length @xmath78 inside the channel .",
    "hence , total change in the polymer free - energy after entry of @xmath77 monomers into the channel is @xmath79 . in this relation ,",
    "the term linear in @xmath77 comes from the entropic energy and the quadratic term is the electric energy .",
    "maximum of @xmath80 with respect to @xmath77 gives the height of the free - energy barrier , @xmath81 , which determines the rate of the polymer entry into the channel : @xmath82    the main dependence of @xmath81 on @xmath83 comes from the @xmath84 term .",
    "the prefactor which contains @xmath85 has a weak dependence on the electric field and over small intervals of the field strength this term is almost constant .",
    "such linear behavior of the energy barrier with @xmath84 can be seen in the inset of fig . [ fig3](a ) . but over large electric field intervals , the changes coming from @xmath85-dependent prefactor is considerable and @xmath38 versus @xmath84 would show deviations from the linear behavior .",

    "[ fig3](a ) , the slope of the fitted line for case @xmath49 is larger than that of case @xmath57 .",

    "the mobility of the charged polymer under electric field is measured in a channel with alternative wide and narrow regions .",
    "this mobility depends on the polymer trap time at the entrance of the narrow regions .",
    "trap times are determined by the free - energy barrier against the entry of the polymer from the wide parts into the narrow parts of the channel .",

    "it has been shown that in the experiment conditions , the free - energy barrier does not depend on the polymer length , @xmath50 , and dependence of the trap time on @xmath50 comes only from the dependence of the polymer attempt time for passing the barrier on the polymer length .",

    "thus by tuning the channel parameters the situation for the polymer before its entry to the channel narrow part could be similar to case @xmath57 . in this way , dependence of the trap time on the polymer length would get stronger and may lead to more optimized polymer separation .",
    "the number of monomers in each blob , @xmath86 , can not be smaller than @xmath87 or larger than the total number of the monomers , @xmath50 . in weaker fields ( or shorter polymer lengths ) , the field is not strong enough to confine the polymer in a layer close to the wall and @xmath88 . as a result , the polymer takes its unperturbed conformation and the radius of gyration is @xmath89 . in the other limit , @xmath90 means that the polymer has lost all of its entropy under the electric field and it enters the channel without feeling a free - energy barrier .",
    "these two limits have also been observed in experiments . a crossover voltage below which no entry happens and another voltage limit above which the entry time changes linearly with the applied voltage",

    "in simulations for checking the theoretical results on the polymer statics before its entry to the channel in both cases @xmath49 and @xmath57 , we block the channel entrance and let the polymer to equilibrate under the electric field . then we measure the radius of gyration of the polymer parallel and perpendicular to the wall and find their scaling exponents with the polymer length and the electric field strength .    in case @xmath49",
    ", the polymer feels no lateral confinement on the wall . in this case , the blobs can be considered as the effective monomers of a 2d polymer .",
    "the blobs have a self - avoiding random walk on the wall and the radius of gyration of the polymer parallel to the wall is @xmath91 in this relation , @xmath54 is substituted from eq .",
    "[ g ] and @xmath92 is the flory exponent in 2d . if the diameter of the confining cylinder is larger than this radius of gyration , @xmath93 , it has no confining effect on the polymer and the situation is similar to case @xmath49 .",
    "but if the cross section of the cylinder is smaller than the monomers total area , @xmath94 , the monomers pile on each other and case @xmath57 is relevant .",

    "this case is not studied in our theory . in this situation ,",
    "the polymer is divided into two parts : one is compressed inside the cylinder and the other is free on the wall . the part outside the channel may act like a spring which drags the inner part out of the channel @xcite .    in",
    "many of the polymer translocation experiments , double stranded dna which its bending rigidity is considerably larger than ssdna has been used .",
