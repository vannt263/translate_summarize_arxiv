    "the distribution of the rest - frame ( u - v ) colour for the agn sample and the average of 1000 realizations of the control sample is shown in the top row of figure [ agnstats ] .",
    "both distributions show comparable shapes , with a peak in the red sequence at ( u - v)@xmath48@xmath42 ( albeit the distribution for the xagn peaks at slightly bluer ( u - v)@xmath48 ) and an exponential tail towards the blue cloud .",
    "the cumulative distribution for the xagn is contained within the 2-@xmath3 dispersion of the mean distribution for inactive galaxies , and the ks - tests finds the two distributions are not significantly different .",
    "while our sample spans a large redshift range , the use of comparison samples matched in stellar mass and redshift ensures that a potential difference in the colour distribution of xagn and inactive galaxies is not obfuscated by redshift and luminosity evolution . to prove this point ,",
    "we calculate for every galaxy its distance to the green valley d@xmath57 = ( u - v)@xmath48 - ( u - v)@xmath57 , with the rest - frame colour of the green valley at the corresponding stellar mass and redshift , ( u - v)@xmath57 , calculated from eq",
    ". 1 . the second row in figure [ agnstats ] shows the distribution of distances to the green valley for the xagn and inactive samples .",
    "their shapes are very similar to the distributions for ( u - v)@xmath48 , because ( u - v)@xmath57 varies by only 0.2 magnitudes for a 10-fold increase in the stellar mass , and the redshift evolution is also small .",
    "about 2/3 of the sources in the xagn and the comparison samples of inactive galaxies are in the red sequence ( d@xmath57@xmath90 ) .",
    "the mean d@xmath57 for red sequence galaxies is slightly lower for the xagn compared to the inactive galaxies ( 0.27 vs 0.32 magnitudes ) .",
    "however , this difference is not significant , and the ks - test finds the two distributions are compatible with being drawn from the same parent population .",
    "this is in agreement with recent results obtained in similar samples ( e.g. : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which found no significant differences between the rest - frame u - v colour of agn hosts and inactive galaxies .",
    "the similarity of the observed u - v colours in mass and redshift matched samples is striking given the widespread observation of a low prevalence of agn among quiescent galaxies ( e.g. : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and higher average sfr in agn hosts compared to inactive galaxies @xcite .",
    "these facts can be reconciled if agn are more likely to be hosted in star - forming galaxies with significant extinction ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . since extinction reddens the u - v colour , it can push some dusty star - forming galaxies into the red sequence",
    ". these galaxies would show u - v colours similar to those of quiescent galaxies , but higher star formation rates .",
    "evidence favouring higher extinction in the agn hosts comes from the uvj restframe color - color diagram ( figure [ uvj - plot ] , left panel ) . in this diagram ,",
    "quiescent galaxies occupy the region with red ( u - v)@xmath48 and blue ( v - j)@xmath48 delimited by the dashed line @xcite . at the same ( u - v)@xmath48 , reddened star - forming galaxies are about 0.7 magnitudes redder in the ( v - j)@xmath48 colour compared to quiescent galaxies .",
    "only 21% of the xagn sources are found in the locus of the quiescent galaxies , while the same region contains 44% of the inactive galaxies in the random comparison samples .",

    "there is a clear ( @xmath93@xmath3 ) excess of agn in galaxies with @xmath41.4 , and also a strong deficit of agn at @xmath91.5 .",
    "the ks - test confirms that the xagn and control samples are different at the @xmath59=0.05 significance level in 70% of realizations .",
    "this is incompatible with the null hypothesis of the xagn and control samples originating from the same population .",
    "the small fraction of xagn sources with @xmath91.5 indicates a low prevalence of agn among passively evolving galaxies .",
    "we note that the peak in the agn number counts at @xmath41.4 is also apparent in m@xmath8@xmath910@xmath60m@xmath11 galaxies at comparable redshifts from zcosmos ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; their figure 11 ) , although it is more prominent in our data .",
    "the ( u - v)@xmath48 versus @xmath29 diagram ( figure [ uvj - plot ] , right panel ) shows that there is a tight correlation between ( u - v)@xmath48 and that applies to both xagn and inactive galaxies .",
    "however , about 1/3 of xagn with intermediate values and ( u - v)@xmath48@xmath42 show ( u - v)@xmath48 excesses of 0.20.4 magnitudes relative to inactive galaxies with the same .",
    "also , very few of the xagn with ( u - v)@xmath48@xmath42 have @xmath29@xmath40.2 , as is the case for the inactive galaxies .",
    "instead , they have lower @xmath29 values which imply the red ( u - v)@xmath48 is due to higher extinction . since ( v - j)@xmath48 and are obtained with independent techniques using different data sets ( broad - band versus intermediate band photometry ) , we are confident that the observed trends are real .",
    "it is enlightening to test whether extinction estimates and extinction - corrected u - v colours have different distributions for the agn hosts and inactive galaxies that support a lower prevalence of agn among intrinsic red galaxies .",
    "one difficulty with sed - fitting based extinction corrections is the degeneracy between metallicity , extinction , and stellar age . while this degeneracy can be partly broken with the help of rest - frame nir photometry",
    ", this implies that the extinction determination is affected by the entire uv to nir sed of the galaxy , not just the population that dominates the emission in the rest - frame @xmath45 and @xmath46 bands . to overcome this issue",
    "we obtain an extinction correction for ( u - v)@xmath48 and using the method of projection down to the dust - free sequence presented in hc13 .",
    "this method has the advantages of relying only on the sed between the rest - frame @xmath45 and @xmath46 bands and not depending on assumptions about the metallicity or sfh of the galaxies .",
    "the first row in figure [ agnstats2 ] shows the distribution of extinction in the rest - frame @xmath46-band calculated with this method for xagn and inactive galaxies . while the uncertainties in a@xmath61 are large ( @xmath40.30.4 magnitudes ) there is a clear trend towards higher extinction in the xagn , with a median value of 1.25 compared to 1.0 in the inactive galaxies .",
    "the second row in figure [ agnstats2 ] shows the distribution of the extinction - corrected rest - frame u - v colour , ( u - v)@xmath50 . there is a strong excess of agn at ( u - v)@xmath50@xmath41.2",
    ", whose significance ( @xmath94@xmath3 ) is boosted by a slight decrease in the number counts of inactive galaxies at the same ( u - v)@xmath50 .",
    "there is also a significant deficit of intrinsic red galaxies ( extinction - corrected ( u - v)@xmath50@xmath91.3 ) among the xagn .",
    "the cumulative distributions for and the extinction - corrected ( u - v)@xmath50 have similar shapes .",
    "this is hardly surprising , since the two magnitudes are not independent .",
    "however , the significance of the difference between the xagn and inactive galaxy distributions is even higher for the extinction - corrected colour ( 80% of realizations with p - value@xmath00.05 ) , probably due to the residual effect that extinction has on values .",
    "while the correspondence between the extinction - corrected values of ( u - v)@xmath48 and is independent of metallicity or sfh , to translate any of them to stellar ages requires to assume a metallicity and sfh . for simplicity",
    ", we define the light weighted average age of the stellar population , @xmath54 , as the age of an instantaneous burst with solar metallicity that produces the observed extinction - corrected and ( u - v)@xmath50 . the bottom row in figure [ agnstats2 ] represents the distributions of @xmath54 for the xagn and inactive galaxies .",
    "since there is a functional relation between the extinction - corrected ( u - v)@xmath50 and @xmath54 , it provides no new information .",
    "the small differences in the number counts , cumulative distributions and frequency distribution of p - values are due to differences in binning , the non - linear nature of the colour-@xmath54 relationship and the randomness of comparison samples .",
    "the and ( u - v)@xmath50 of the peak of the xagn distribution translates to @xmath54@xmath4300500 myr . in hc13 we estimated from stellar population models that a galaxy with a constant sfr has a light - weighted average stellar age that converges towards @xmath54 = 300 myr .",
    "this implies that galaxies with @xmath54@xmath0300 myr must have experienced a recent increase in their sfr , while those with @xmath54@xmath9300 myr have recent sfr below their long - term average .",
    "the observed peak in the frequency of x - ray detected agn at 300@xmath0@xmath54@xmath0500 myr would then imply that the probability of observing agn activity peaks when the last star formation episode is already in decline .",
    "this is in agreement with the detection of significant post - starburst stellar populations in the hosts galaxies of luminous local agn @xcite and results from detailed analysis of the stellar populations in local agn hosts , which find that the average accretion rate rises steeply @xmath4250 myr after the onset of the starburst @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "the distribution of restframe ( u - v ) colours and distances to the green valley of xagn sources are not significantly different from those of inactive galaxies , in agreement with previous results .",
    "however , once the effects of extinction are removed ( either by using the index or the extinction corrected ( u - v ) colour ) there is a clear excess of agn at values that correspond to intermediate stellar ages ( @xmath54=300500 myr ) as well as a deficit of agn in quiescent galaxies .      we have shown evidence that the frequency of agn detections depends mainly on the stellar mass of the host galaxy . once the stellar mass selection effects are taken into account , a clear dependence on stellar",
    "age appears that favours intermediate age hosts .",
    "we wish to address now the question of whether there is a mass dependence on the distribution of the agn fraction as a function of stellar age .",
    "other studies have found evidence for such a dependence . in a larger sample of x - ray",
    "selected agn , @xcite found that for the most massive galaxies ( @xmath910@xmath55 m@xmath11 ) the agn fraction is highest in the blue cloud , while at lower masses it peaks in the green valley . using the index",
    ", @xcite obtained an equivalent result : while at m@xmath8@xmath910@xmath62 m@xmath11 the agn fraction is higher among the galaxies with a weaker 4000  break , the peak shifts to @xmath41.5 if galaxies in the 10@xmath60@xmath0m@xmath8/m@xmath11@xmath010@xmath62 m@xmath11 range are also included .    for comparison ,",
    "we show in table [ xagn - freq - table ] the agn fraction as a function of ( u - v)@xmath48 , , ( u - v)@xmath50 , and @xmath54 for three mass bins .",
    "percentages indicate the agn fraction among galaxies within a given interval of stellar mass and one of the age indicators .",
    "the values in parenthesis represent the number of xagn sources and the total number of galaxies in each group .",
    "we find that for the mass bins 10.5@xmath63m@xmath8/m@xmath6411.0 and 11.0@xmath63m@xmath8/m@xmath6411.5 all four indicators are consistent with comparable agn fractions for young and intermediate age stellar populations , and much lower fractions ( a factor 35 lower ) in galaxies with old populations .",
    "although the agn fraction seems to increase slightly faster with stellar mass for the galaxies with the youngest stellar populations , we find the difference not to be significant due to the limited sample size .",
    "therefore , we can not confirm a mass dependence of the relative frequency of agn as a function of stellar age .      , width=321 ]    the luminosity and accretion rate of powerful agn ( l@xmath5@xmath910@xmath6 erg s@xmath7 ) is found to correlate with the sfr in the host galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "however , there is no clear correlation between global star formation and nuclear activity in low and moderate luminosity agn @xcite . in star - forming galaxies , a recent burst of star formation",
    "can easily dominate the uv output of the galaxy , making stellar ages based on the u - v colour or appear younger even if young stars only represent a small fraction of the total stellar mass in the galaxy . as a consequence",

    "the fisher exact test gives a p - value of 0.099 , which implies the difference is significant only at the @xmath490% confidence level .",
    "if confirmed in larger agn samples , this would be consistent with the picture of agn reaching peak luminosity a few hundred myr after the onset of the starburst @xcite .",
    "the main result of this work is the existence of a significant excess of x - ray selected agn in galaxies with intermediate stellar ages ( 0.3@xmath0@xmath54@xmath00.5 gyr ) , which correspond to @xmath41.4 , after the stellar mass and redshift dependences of the agn fraction have been accounted for .",
    "this excess at intermediate ages is in contrast to previous results that suggested either an increased agn fraction among the galaxies with younger populations @xcite , in red ones @xcite or no dependence at all @xcite .",
    "while our agn sample is small , the excess is statistically significant mostly because the procedure used to estimate stellar ages allows us to break the age - extinction degeneracy , therefore eliminating the dispersion that extinction introduces in rest - frame colours such as ( u - v)@xmath48 .",
    "a source of uncertainty for the analysis presented here is conceivably the impact of agn emission in the measurement of stellar ages and stellar masses .",
    "while in  [ sample - selection - sec ] we argued that the impact of agn emission in optical colours and derived stellar masses is negligible for galaxies with a clear 1.6 m stellar bump , it is reassuring to test whether our results can be interpreted as a consequence of contamination from the agn emission .",
    "the observed distribution of for the xagn sources can be accurately reproduced in the comparison sample of inactive galaxies by decreasing by 10% the value of all galaxies with @xmath91.45 . to check whether emission from a type 1 agn in a quiescent galaxy could decrease the index by the required amount while avoiding being identified in the acs images ,",
    "we calculate the fractional agn contribution to the rest - frame @xmath45 band luminosity required to reduce by 10% .",
    "we use the sdss quasar composite template from @xcite as the type 1 agn template , and the elliptical template from @xcite as the quiescent galaxy template .",
    "we obtain that a 10% reduction in from agn contamination alone requires the agn to contribute @xmath450% of the integrated luminosity in the rest - frame @xmath45 band .",
    "if the agn sed is redder or the galaxy sed is bluer than our assumption , then the required agn contribution to the rest - frame @xmath45 band emission is even higher .",
    "we obtain conservative upper limits on the agn contribution to the restframe @xmath45 band emission using acs photometry in the @xmath65 band from the version r2.0z of the goods acs multi - band source catalogs @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we calculate the ratio between the flux contained in circular apertures with radii 0.088 `` and 1 '' .",
    "the former contains 50% of the flux for an unresolved point source , while the later matches the aperture used for our shards photometry .",
    "we find that the median flux ratio is 4% , which implies the agn contributes less than 8% to the restframe @xmath45 band emission in the shards photometry for 50% of the xagn sources .",
    "the flux ratio is below 10% for 90% of the sample , and the highest value is 14.5% , which represents a maximum agn contribution @xmath030% .",
    "agn emission can also bias the distribution of ( u - v)@xmath48 and via overestimation of stellar masses . the additional emission in the nir arising from the agn boosts stellar mass estimates , and as a consequence agn hosts are compared to inactive galaxies that are actually slightly more massive .",
    "the stellar mass - age correlation then makes agn hosts seem younger .",
    "we use observed irac colours to estimate the fraction of nir emission that arises from the agn in the xagn sample .",
    "we define the colour excess @xmath44([3.6]-[5.8 ] ) of a source as the difference between its observed [ 3.6]-[5.8 ] colour index and the average value for inactive galaxies at the same redshift .",
    "the mean @xmath44([3.6]-[5.8 ] ) for xagn sources is 0.1 magnitudes .",
    "this implies the agn contributes between @xmath415% and @xmath425% of the observed 5.8 m flux density , depending on the redshift , and less than 10% at the peak of the stellar emission .",
    "such a small contribution is unlikely to have any noticeable impact in stellar mass estimates .",
    "finally , we note that while the strongest discrepancy between distributions for the xagn and comparison samples is found in the extinction corrected parameters ( ( u - v)@xmath50 , @xmath54 ) the signal is sufficiently strong in the index to rule out the extinction correction procedure as a probable cause for the observed trends .",
    "furthermore , the lower fractions of xagn in the quiescent locus of figure [ uvj - plot ] compared to inactive galaxies confirms that agn are more likely to be hosted in star - forming galaxies .",
    "we analyse the stellar populations in the host galaxies of 53 x - ray selected moderate luminosity ( l@xmath5@xmath010@xmath6 erg s@xmath7 ) optically faint agn at 0.34@xmath0@xmath13@xmath01.07 in the area of the goods - n field covered by the shards survey .",
    "the ultra - deep ( @xmath66@xmath026.5 ) optical medium - band ( r@xmath450 ) photometry from shards allows us to consistently measure the strength of the 4000  break .",
    "this , in conjunction with the rest - frame ( u - v ) colour , provides a robust measurement of the extinction that is independent of assumptions on the metallicity and sfh of the galaxies .",
    "this allows us to obtain extinction - corrected ( u - v ) colours and light - weighted average stellar ages ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "we confirm a steep increase in the frequency of agn with the stellar mass of an order of magnitude between 10@xmath53 and 10@xmath55 m@xmath11 .",
    "50% of our x - ray selected agn are in hosts more massive than 10@xmath55 m@xmath11 and @xmath495% have m@xmath8@xmath910@xmath53 m@xmath11 .",
    "a careful selection of random control samples of inactive galaxies allows us to remove the stellar mass and redshift dependences of the agn fraction to explore trends with stellar age .",
    "we confirm that x - ray selected agn hosts have rest - frame u - v colours comparable to those of inactive galaxies at the same mass and redshift . in particular , 2/3 of the agn hosts in our sample and a comparable fraction of inactive galaxies are in the red sequence . however , we find that the fraction of agn hosts with uvj colours in the quiescent locus is only half the fraction found in inactive galaxies .",
    "the other half are instead dusty star - forming galaxies with bluer extinction - corrected colours .",
    "measurements and extinction - corrected u - v colours both support significantly younger stellar populations in the agn hosts , with a strong deficit of agn among galaxies with older ( @xmath54@xmath91 gyr ) stellar populations .",
    "we find that x - ray detected moderate luminosity agn ( @xmath29(l@xmath5/erg s@xmath7)@xmath441.544.0 ) are more prevalent in galaxies with intermediate stellar ages ( 0.3@xmath0@xmath54@xmath00.5 gyr ) compared to younger or older galaxies , consistent with a delayed onset of agn activity after a star formation episode .",

    "<S> we analyse the stellar populations in the host galaxies of 53 x - ray selected optically dull active galactic nuclei ( agn ) at 0.34@xmath0z@xmath01.07 with ultra - deep ( m@xmath1@xmath226.5 , 3@xmath3 ) optical medium - band ( r@xmath450 ) photometry from the survey for high - z absorption red and dead sources ( shards ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral resolution of shards allows us to consistently measure the strength of the 4000  break , , a reliable age indicator for stellar populations . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that most x - ray selected moderate - luminosity agn ( l@xmath5@xmath010@xmath6 erg s@xmath7 ) are hosted by massive galaxies ( typically m@xmath8 @xmath910@xmath10 m@xmath11 ) and that the observed fraction of galaxies hosting an agn increases with the stellar mass </S>",
    "<S> . a careful selection of random control samples of inactive galaxies allows us to remove the stellar mass and redshift dependences of the agn fraction to explore trends with several stellar age indicators . </S>",
    "<S> we find no significant differences in the distribution of the rest - frame u - v colour for agn hosts and inactive galaxies , in agreement with previous results . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find significantly shallower 4000 breaks in agn hosts , indicative of younger stellar populations . with the help of a model - independent determination of the extinction , we obtain extinction - corrected u - v colours and light - weighted average stellar ages . </S>",
    "<S> we find that agn hosts have younger stellar populations and higher extinction compared to inactive galaxies with the same stellar mass and at the same redshift . </S>",
    "<S> we find a highly significant excess of agn hosts with @xmath41.4 and light weighted average stellar ages of 300500 myr , as well as a deficit of agn in intrinsic red galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret failure in recognizing these trends in previous studies as a consequence of the balancing effect in observed colours of the age - extinction degeneracy .    </S>",
