    "as an example , we discuss how to create an artificial benzene molecule and compute the orbital wave functions . in real benzene , the molecular structure is formed by a ring of six carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]c ) .",
    "thereby , the molecular symmetry is essential for the formation of molecular orbitals , where benzene belongs to the point group @xmath3 . in our case ,",
    "the idea is to simulate the electrons in a molecular structure via ultracold atoms in a tailored optical dipole potential that mimics the coulomb interaction with the nuclei .",
    "the optical potential is imposed by the ac stark shift of a laser field and can be created for the example of benzene by superposing a hexagonal optical lattice @xmath4 @xcite with a tight dipole trap @xmath5 as shown in fig .  [ fig1]a ( see appendix ) .",
    "a similar potential can , e.g. , also be created by adding a triangular superlattice to the honeycomb lattice ( a `` benzene lattice '' @xcite ) or by using a spatial light modulator , which renders the possibility of almost arbitrary two - dimensional potentials @xcite . in the orthogonal direction",
    "a one - dimensional lattice @xmath6 with depth @xmath7 or a light sheet is applied .",
    "a controlled number of fermionic atoms ( e.g. @xmath8li atoms with spin states @xmath9 ) can be loaded into this optical potential @xcite ( see appendix ) .",
    "the molecular orbitals of the artificial molecule are computed using the plane - wave expansion method for vanishing interaction ( see appendix for technical details and parameters ) .",
    "the resulting single - particle orbitals are shown in fig .",
    "the six lowest @xmath10 orbitals represent an energetically separated shell within the inner `` c '' ring , whereas the higher orbitals ( 7 - 18 , 25 - 30 ) are @xmath11-hybridized .",
    "the orbitals ( 7 - 11 ) and the antibonding orbital ( 13 ) form @xmath12 orbitals pointing along the c ring .",
    "the outward - pointing @xmath12 orbitals ( 12 ) and ( 14 - 18 ) lower their energy by maximizing the overlap to the @xmath10 orbitals of the h atoms .",
    "the hybridized orbitals ( 25 - 30 ) show a nodal plane between h and c ring and thus have a higher energy . energetically in between lie the delocalized @xmath13 orbitals ( 19 - 24 ) with a nodal plane at @xmath14 .",
    "benzene is one of the prime examples for this type of delocalized conjugation of a @xmath0 electron system stabilizing the planar ring structure .",
    "this property is commonly referred to as aromaticity .",
    "accounting for in total 42 electrons , in benzene three of the six @xmath13 orbitals are occupied .",
    "we can tune the energetic order of the orbitals , by tuning the parameters of the potential , e.g. strength and width of the dipole trap as well as the lattice depths @xmath15 and @xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) .",
    "quantum gas microscopes have demonstrated optical imaging with single - site resolution in an optical lattice @xcite .",
    "however , the imaging of molecular wave functions of artificially created molecules requires an optical resolution several times better than the optical lattice spacing .",
    "the idea is to overcome the limited spatial resolution by imaging the particles in momentum space . in ultracold atom experiments ,",
    "this can be achieved by turning off the optical potential , letting the particles freely expand and imaging the particle density @xmath16 after a certain time of flight . in the language of molecular physics",
    ", this would be equivalent to a sudden removal of all nuclei . during the expansion",
    ", the interactions quickly become negligible , because there are only few particles with high momenta .",
    "this allows for a free expansion in two dimensions with an unaltered lattice in the @xmath17 direction avoiding problems with a limited depth of focus of the imaging system .",
    "in addition , the interaction among the particles can be tuned to zero via a feshbach resonance during the expansion . for suitably long expansion times @xmath18 ( see supplemental material @xcite )",
    ", the momentum density can be expressed as @xmath19 with momenta @xmath20 , @xmath21 the lattice constant of the honeycomb lattice , and @xmath22 the planck constant .    in the example shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b , we assume that we can image the momentum density after the time of flight with @xmath23 discrete momenta using a so - called pinning lattice for imaging ( see appendix ) . initially preparing",
    "one particle ( or two with opposite spin without interaction ) only the lowest orbital @xmath24 is occupied and per experimental sequence only @xmath25-@xmath26 momenta are recorded . to show the feasibility of the proposed imaging method",
    ", we use a random number generator with an accumulated number of @xmath27 momenta . note that in principle satisfying results with fewer observed momenta are possible ( see supplemental material @xcite , fig .",
    "figure [ fig2]b ( first row ) shows that the statics is clearly sufficient to map out the momentum distribution of the orbitals .",
    "the phase of the distribution can be retrieved by identifying the nodal lines of the momentum density ( @xmath28 ) and mapping it piecewise to the momentum wave function with @xmath29 ( second row ) .",
    "since the potential is symmetric , @xmath30 can be assumed to be real .",
    "the components of @xmath30 are the fourier coefficients of the wave function and therefore allow the direct transformation to orbital wave functions in real space via @xmath31 with plane waves @xmath32 lattice constant @xmath21 and the number of grid points @xmath33 per reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "the resulting density is plotted in the third row of fig .",
    "the figure demonstrates that the effective resolution of the imaging method is very high . in principle , the resolution is given by the diameter in momentum space .",
    "however , since the momentum wave function drops exponentially to zero for higher values of @xmath34 , we can assume @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",
    "since the diameter in momentum space is not limiting , the spatial resolution in the experiment is mainly influenced by the statistics of the momentum density ( see supplemental material @xcite , fig .",

    "experimentally , we can probe the energies of the interacting problem ( benzene has 42 electrons ) by exciting a particle to a reference orbital using a microwave transition , which also changes the internal state .",
    "this avoids problems with postinteraction , assuming that the particles in the two different internal atomic states do not interact .",
    "furthermore , the population in this internal atomic state serves as an observable measuring the transfer rate as a function of excitation energy .    to demonstrate how interactions change the electronic configuration ,",

    "for the interaction strength @xmath75 , the ratio @xmath76 is in the vicinity of the proposed values for aromatic hydrocarbons which are still under debate @xcite .",
    "the tunability of interaction strength and potential depth allows an independent control of the ratios @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( or the next - neighbor interaction for long - rage interactions @xcite ) .",
    "one of the outstanding advantages of ultracold atomic systems is that the dynamical time scale is on the order of milli- or microseconds .",
    "therefore , artificial molecules would allow monitoring of dynamical processes taking place on femto- or attoseconds time scales in real molecules .",

    "switching on the ( repulsive ) interaction among the particles ( fig .",

    "the antiferromagnetic order is apparent in the spin - down component causing the almost vanishing total density on site @xmath80 .",
