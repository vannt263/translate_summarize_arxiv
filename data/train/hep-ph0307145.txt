    "the approximation simplifies the usual feynman rules for the quark propagator and quark - gluon vertex as follows : ( p ) ( -i ^ ) ( p ) ^ = |u(p ) with @xmath1 the gluon momentum , @xmath2 the quark momentum after emission of the gluon , @xmath3 a dimensionless vector @xmath4 , and i have omitted overall factors of @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 the generators of su(3 ) in the fundamental representation .",
    "the eikonal approximation has numerous phenomenological applications in qcd , including threshold resummations for a variety of qcd processes @xcite . in these applications we are mainly interested in the ultraviolet ( uv ) pole structure ( in dimensional regularization ) of one - loop , two - loop , and higher - loop eikonal vertex corrections . in this talk ,",
