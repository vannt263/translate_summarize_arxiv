    "the xenon dark matter search experiment  @xcite uses time projection chamber ( tpc ) to search for the hypothetical wimp dark matter particles .",
    "the detector ( see the most recent status at @xcite ) consists a bulk of liquid xenon ( lxe ) as the target for wimp interactions .",
    "the target is also self - shielded from the external background events , mostly gamma rays .",
    "the external gamma rays have more chance to interact near the edge and surface of the lxe target",
    ". a fiducial volume cut of the edge and surface events will dramatically reduce the background rate and improve the detector s sensitivity for dark matter search .",
    "a fiducial volume cut will also help to remove events from the regions ( edge or surface ) with irregular or non - uniform electric fields .",
    "the signals of events from these regions can be similar to the wimp signals and make them difficult to be rejected without 3d position sensitivity .",
    "a position sensitive detector will also have the capability to distinguish neutron interactions by their multiple scatters in the target , while a wimp is very unlikely to make more than one scatter due to its tiny interaction cross - section .",
    "the xenon experiment uses a two - phase ( liquid / gas ) xenon detector .",
    "an event in the detector produces two signals : a prompt direct scintillation light ( s1 ) and a delayed proportional scintillation light ( s2 ) .",
    "the delayed s2 signal is from the ionization electrons that are drifted from the event site in the liquid to the gas phase .",
    "the event @xmath0 position is calculated from the electron drift velocity ( about 2  @xmath1 at 1 kv / cm drift field ) times the drift time .",
    "the diffusion of the drifted electrons in lxe is very small , which gives a very localized @xmath2 positions for the s2 signal .",
    "using an array of photon - detectors on top of the s2 signal , the @xmath2 positions can be reconstructed from the s2 signal distributions in these photon - detectors . during the r&d phase of xenon experiment , a detector ( called xenon3 )",
    "was constructed with 21 hamamatsu r9288 pmts ( 1-inch - square each ) installed in the gas phase , right on top of the structure where proportional scintillation occurs .",
    "[ xenon3 ] shows the structure of the 21-pmt array .",
    "the array covers the 5-cm - radius surface area of the lxe target .        to reconstruct the @xmath2 positions ,",
    "a simulated s2 map is produced for comparing with the actual s2 distributions from the detector .",
    "the simulated s2 distributions on the 21 pmts are produced for each @xmath3 pixel in the 5-cm - radius sensitive area , where proportional scintillation light occurs .",
    "a minimum-@xmath4 method is used for the comparing .",
    "the minimum-@xmath4 method calculates the @xmath4 value as in equation [ eq : mchi ] .",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 are the measured and expected ( from simulation ) s2 signals ( in number of photoelectrons ) for the @xmath7th pmt .",
    "@xmath8 is the total number of pmts in the top pmt array ( for xenon3 detector , @xmath8 = 21 ) .",
    "@xmath9 ^ 2}{\\sigma_i^2 }    \\label{eq : mchi}\\ ] ]    here @xmath10 is the uncertainties from both the measured signal @xmath5 and simulated expectation signal @xmath6 .",
    "if the simulation has enough statistics , the major contribution to @xmath10 is the measured signal fluctuation , which includes the statistical fluctuations of photoelectron emission ( @xmath11 ) from the pmt s photocathode and its gain fluctuation ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "it can be approximately written as in equation [ eq : sigma_xy ] .",
    "@xmath11 is simply equal to @xmath13 , providing @xmath5 is sufficiently large .",
    "@xmath12 was measured for each pmt based on its single photoelectron spectrum , where @xmath14 is the gain of that pmt .",
    "@xmath15=s_i\\left[1 + ( \\sigma_{g_i}/g_i)^2\\right]\\ ] ]    the @xmath4 value is computed for all possible @xmath2 positions , in 1  mm@xmath16 pixels . the minimum value , @xmath17 , corresponds to the reconstructed event @xmath2 positions .",
    "the @xmath0 position , calculated from the electron drift time , is quite precise . the resolution is better than 1 mm . due to the solid - angle effect of light collection and the electron - negative impurities in liquid xenon , both s1 and s2 signals are dependent on @xmath0-position .",
    "the precise @xmath0 positions thus can be used to correct the signals .",
    "the sub - mm resolution also allows a very precise fiducial volume cut based on @xmath0 .    with a localized 5.3  mev @xmath18 source in the detector ,",
    "the @xmath2 position resolutions were measured to be around 3 mm ( @xmath19 ) ( see fig . [ alpha ] ) .",
    "the @xmath2 position resolutions are not as good as that for @xmath0 .",
    "but they are sufficient for making fiducial volume cut in @xmath2 .",
    "positions of a @xmath18 source located at ( x = -24 mm , y = -10 mm ) in the xenon3 detector .",
    "the reconstructed @xmath20 position has a small offset .",
    "the position resolutions for both @xmath20 and @xmath21 are less than 3 mm ( @xmath19).,height=226 ]    to verify the position sensitivity for events near the edge , an external low energy @xmath22-ray source ( @xmath23 ) was used .",
    "@xmath23 emits mainly 122 kev @xmath22 rays . with its small attenuation length in liquid xenon ,",
    "most of the 122 kev @xmath22 rays interact near the detector s edge .",
    "[ co57 ] shows the reconstructed radial position distribution of the 122 kev @xmath22-ray events , compared with expected distribution from a geant4 simulation .",
    "the distributions from experiment and simulation match quite well , while the reconstructed positions have a tendency to the edge .",
    "this is very possibly due to the less coverage of pmts near the edge .",

    "reconstructed positions from experiment are compared with simulations.,height=226 ]    the two - phase xenon detectors have a good gamma background rejection efficiency , based on the ratio of s2 and s1 signals , as demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "the s2/s1 value for nuclear recoils ( from wimps ) are much smaller than that from electron recoils ( background gammas ) .",
    "the s2 signal is proportional to the number of electrons extracted from the liquid to the gas . in a realistic detector",
    ", the non - uniformity of the electric field near the edge usually gives an insufficient electron extraction (  edge effect \" ) , resulted a smaller s2/s1 value , which makes the electron recoils leaking into the nuclear recoil region , as reported in @xcite .",
    "the xenon3 detector was exposed to a neutron source and the  edge effect \" was also observed , as in fig .",
    "[ s2s1_n ] ( top ) .",
    "the neutron elastic recoil events are clearly separated from the electron recoils .",
    "neutrons also interact inelastically and produce meta - stable states from @xmath24xe and @xmath25xe in the liquid xenon target .",
    "the @xmath26xe and @xmath27xe emit 40 kev and 80 kev gammas .",
    "neutrons also make inelastic scattering on @xmath28f in the ptfe material , surrounding the liquid xenon target .",
    "the ptfe is used to improve the scintillation light collection .",
    "the @xmath29f produces 110 kev gammas , mostly interacting near the edge .",
    "it s clear from fig .  [ s2s1_n ] ( top ) that a portion of these edge events have smaller s2/s1 value , due to the  edge effect \" .",
    "a fiducial volume cut out of 5 mm from the edge significantly reduces the number of edge events and makes a better electron / nuclear recoil discrimination , as shown in fig .",
    "[ s2s1_n ] ( bottom ) .",
    "+     in a larger scale detector ( e.g. 100 kg of lxe ) , the capability of rejecting neutron background becomes more necessary .",
    "neutrons , unlike @xmath22-ray background , will make elastic scattering on the target and produce nuclear recoils , the same as those from wimps .",
    "it s not possible to reject those neutron events based on s2/s1 ratio . but neutrons have a much larger interaction cross - section than the wimps and they can make multiple scatters in the target . a 3d position sensitive detector , such as the one described in the current work , will be able to reject those background neutron events with multiple scatters .",
    "a larger scale detector ( xenon10 ) has been constructed and deployed underground for dark matter search @xcite .",
    "the same technique discussed here for the 3d position realization will be applied to xenon10 .",
