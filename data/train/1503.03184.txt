    "deconvolution is a challenging open problem in signal processing that manifests itself in a host of applications like image de - blurring , blind system identification , and blind equalization .",
    "the difficulty of blind deconvolution stems from its ill - posedness in the sense of hadamard  @xcite as well as non - linearity of the problem . in practice ,",
    "additional application specific prior information on the unknown signals is necessary to render this inverse problem better behaved .",
    "_ sparsity _ based models have been used extensively in the past decade to capture hidden signal structures in many applications of interest .",
    "while there have been a few attempts at exploiting sparsity based priors for blind deconvolution type of problems  @xcite , strong theoretical guarantees on signal identifiability for such sparse models are largely missing with the exception of @xcite ( which proves an interesting positive result under idealized assumptions ) . exploring more realistic sparsity assumptions pertaining to multi - hop channel estimation , we prove some surprising negative results for signal identifiability in the present article .",
    "i of this paper  @xcite was devoted to the characterization of the ambiguity space associated with blind deconvolution and the proof of a strong unidentifiability result .",
    "ii of the paper utilizes the results in  i to characterize the ambiguity space for sparsity constrained blind deconvolution problems .",
    "in particular , canonical - sparse blind deconvolution is considered and a trade - off is derived between the level of sparsity in the unknown signals and the dimension of the ambiguity space . unfortunately , the derived scaling laws turn out to be unfavorable when compared to analogous results in compressed sensing  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , an application of the methodology to a theoretical abstraction of the second - hop channel estimation problem , yields an unfavorable sparsity - ambiguity trade - off for a family of subspace coded signals that include repetition coding and geometrically decaying signals .",
    "we briefly reviewed prior research on the multi - channel version of blind deconvolution  @xcite in  i ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "we briefly recap prior art discussed in  i of the paper that pertains specifically to blind deconvolution in single - input - single - output ( siso ) systems , before mentioning more related research .    for siso blind deconvolution (  blind channel estimation )",
    ",  @xcite showed that input signal realizations with no inter - symbol - interference ( isi ) could be uniquely recovered up to scalar multiplicative ambiguities .",
    "in contrast , we showed in  i of the paper that if isi were allowed , blind deconvolution is ill - posed to the point of almost every input signal pair being unidentifiable . in the papers",
    "@xcite , blind deconvolution was cast as a rank one matrix recovery problem for the development of convex programming based computational heuristics and a proof of correctness was provided assuming a random subspace precoding with sufficient redundancy .",
    "we adopted this framework in our earlier works  @xcite on an information theoretic characterization of identifiability of the solution to general bilinear inverse problems and showed good predictive performance of the theory for blind deconvolution with gaussian / rademacher inputs . whereas  @xcite derived conditions for identifiability ( analogous to achievability results in information theory ) and developed an abstract theory of regularized bilinear inverse problems ,",
    "making assumptions no more specific than non - convex cone constrained priors , the present paper makes a significant departure in the sense that more explicit sparsity and subspace priors are considered that are motivated by applications in multi - hop channel estimation  @xcite and the focus is on characterizing the inherent _ unidentifiability _ of blind deconvolution ( akin to converse / impossibility results in information theory ) . we point out that beside multi - hop communications , convolution with sparse vectors is an intuitive modeling assumption in other applications as well ,  high resolution astronomical imaging  @xcite , modeling echoing audio signals  @xcite , ultrasound imaging  @xcite , and sporadic communications in 5 g systems  @xcite .",
    "a promising identifiability analysis was proposed in  @xcite , leveraging results from  @xcite on matrix factorization for sparse dictionary learning using the and @xmath0 quasi - norm for @xmath1 .",
    "their approach and formulation differ from ours in two important aspects .",
    "firstly , we are interested in single - in - single - out ( siso ) systems whereas  @xcite deals with single - in - multiple - out ( simo ) systems .",
    "secondly ,  @xcite analyzes identifiability as a _ local _ optimum to a _ non - convex _ @xmath2 ( or @xmath0 for @xmath1 ) optimization and hence is heavily dependent on the algorithmic formulation , whereas we consider the solution as the local / global optimum to the @xmath3 optimization problem and our impossibility results are information theoretic in nature , implying that they hold regardless of algorithmic formulation .",
    "we emphasize that the constrained @xmath4 optimization formulation in @xcite is non - convex and therefore does not imply existence of provably correct and efficient recovery algorithms , despite identifiability of the channel . although it would be interesting to try and extend their approach to siso systems and compare with our results , this is non - trivial and beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "an inverse problem closely related to blind deconvolution is the fourier phase retrieval problem  @xcite where a signal has to be reconstructed from its autocorrelation function .",
    "this is clearly a special case of the blind deconvolution problem with much fewer degrees of freedom and allows identifiability and tractable recovery with a sparsity prior on the signal  @xcite .",
    "a second important difference is that after _ lifting _",
    "@xcite , the fourier phase retrieval problem has one linear constraint involving a positive semidefinite matrix .",
    "this characteristic is known to be helpful in the conditioning of the inverse problem and in the development of recovery algorithms  @xcite .",
    "while the blind deconvolution problem does not enjoy the same advantage , this approach seems to be a good avenue to explore if additional constraints are allowed .",
    "this is a future direction of research .    as in  i , we rely on the _ parameter counting _",
    "heuristic to quantify ` dimension ' of a set / space .",
    "the parameter counting heuristic can be made rigorous using the framework of _ hausdorff dimension _",
    "@xcite , but we shall not bridge this gap in the present paper owing to space limitations .      in this work ,",
    "we quantify unidentifiability for certain families of noiseless sparse blind deconvolution problems under a _ non - asymptotic _ and _ non - statistical _ setup .",
    "specifically , given model orders @xmath5 , we investigate the trade - off between the level of sparsity in the unknown signal pair @xmath6 and the dimension of the unidentifiable subset of signals in @xmath7 . while  i of the paper focused on developing a description of the ambiguity space ,  ii studies the interaction of this ambiguity space with canonical - sparse vectors and further extends the techniques to consider repetition coded and geometrically decaying vectors . to motivate our signal choices ,",
    "the specific application we consider is multi - hop sparse channel estimation for relay assisted communication described in  [ sec : results with coding ] .",
    "like  i , our focus is on an _ algorithm independent _ identifiability analysis and hence we shall _ not _ examine efficient / polynomial - time algorithms , but rather show information theoretic impossibility results .",
    "our approach leads to the following novelties for  ii ( refer to  @xcite for contributions of  i of the paper ) .    1 .",
    "we show that sparsity in the canonical basis is not sufficient to ensure identifiability , even in the presence of perfect model order information , and we construct non - zero dimensional unidentifiable subsets of the domain @xmath7 for any given support set of @xmath8 ( or @xmath9 ) as evidence to quantify the sparsity - ambiguity trade - off .",
    "this is the content of  [ thm : sparse unident moderate ] in  [ sec : sparse deconv ] .",
    "we consider a theoretical abstraction to a multi - hop channel estimation problem and extend our unidentifiability results to this setting .",
    "specifically , we show that other types of side information like repetition coding or geometric decay for the unknown vectors are still insufficient for identifiability , and exhibit an ambiguity trade - off analogous to the case of canonical - sparsity .",
    "this is the content of  [ thm : sparse cooperative coding unident ] and  [ cor : repetition coding unident ] and  [ cor : sparse geometric unident ] in  [ sec : results with coding ] .",

    "their meanings are allowed to differ _ across _ theorems and proofs ( and even across disjoint subparts of the same proof when there is no risk of confusion ) , thus facilitating the reuse of variable names across different theorems and avoiding heavy notation .",
    "in this section , we review the system model from  i of the paper and overview a new result from  ii of the paper with a numerical example .",
    "the results in  ii of the paper continue to use the same system model , but with a different feasible set of signals .",

    "this leads us to the definition of identifiability in  i that we restate below .",

    "let @xmath51 denote the set of equivalence classes of @xmath7 induced by @xmath50 , and for any @xmath37 let @xmath52 denote the equivalence class containing @xmath53 .",
