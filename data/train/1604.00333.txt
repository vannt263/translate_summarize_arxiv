    "precise knowledge of the mass of the higgs boson will be important for precision tests of the standard model - some higgs decay rates depend on it quite sensitively - but is also crucial for understanding the stability of the electroweak vacuum  @xcite , as discussed later .",
    "one of the most basic questions about the higgs boson is whether it is elementary or composite . in the former case ,",
    "the large sizes of loop corrections pose the problem of the naturalness ( fine - tuning ) of the electroweak scale .",

    "early versions of this idea tended to fail electroweak precision tests and predicted a relatively heavy higgs - like scalar boson .",

    "specifically , assuming that the cosmological dark matter is provided by the lightest neutralino , in the cmssm the dark matter density constraint provides an upper limit on the supposedly universal fermion mass @xmath26 for fixed scalar mass @xmath27 , whereas at low values of @xmath27 and @xmath26 there is tension between the lhc searches for missing - energy events and the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , @xmath28 .",
