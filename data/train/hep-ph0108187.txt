    "@xmath3 and @xmath2 physics together with polarised deep inelastic scattering provide complementary windows on the role of gluons in dynamical chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "gluonic degrees of freedom play an important role in the physics of the flavour - singlet @xmath4 channel @xcite through the qcd axial anomaly @xcite .",
    "the most famous example is the @xmath5 problem : the masses of the @xmath3 and @xmath2 mesons are much greater than the values they would have if these mesons were pure goldstone bosons associated with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "this extra mass is induced by non - perturbative gluon dynamics @xcite and the axial anomaly @xcite .",
    "for the first time since the discovery of qcd ( and the u(1 ) problem ) precise data are emerging on processes involving @xmath2 production and decays .",
    "there is presently a vigorous experimental programme to study the @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions close to threshold in low - energy proton - nucleon collisions at celsius @xcite and cosy @xcite .",
    "new data on @xmath2 photoproduction , @xmath6 , are expected soon from jefferson laboratory @xcite following earlier measurements at elsa @xcite .",
    "the light - mass `` exotic '' meson states with quantum numbers @xmath7 observed at bnl @xcite and cern @xcite in @xmath8 and @xmath9 scattering were discovered in decays to @xmath10 and @xmath11 suggesting a possible connection with axial u(1 ) dynamics .",
    "further `` exotic '' studies are proposed in photoproduction experiments at jefferson laboratory . at higher energies anomalously large branching ratios",
    "have been observed by cleo for @xmath12-meson decays to an @xmath2 plus additional hadrons @xcite and for the @xmath13 @xcite process .",
    "the @xmath12 decay measurements have recently been confirmed in new , more precise , data from babar @xcite and belle @xcite .",
    "the lep data on @xmath2 production in hadronic jets is about 40% short of the predictions of the string fragmentation models employed in the jetset and ariadne monte - carlos without an additional @xmath2 `` suppression factor '' @xcite .",
    "first measurements of @xmath14 decays have been performed at cleo @xcite .",
    "the new wasa 4@xmath15 detector @xcite at celsius will enable precision studies of @xmath3 and @xmath2 decays .",
    "data expected in the next few years provides an exciting new opportunity to study axial u(1 ) dynamics and to investigate the role of gluonic degrees of freedom in @xmath3 and @xmath2 physics .    in this lecture",
    "we focus primarily on @xmath2 production in proton - proton collisions together with a brief review of the axial u(1 ) problem in qcd .    the role of gluonic degrees of freedom and ozi violation in the @xmath2nucleon system has been investigated through the flavour - singlet goldberger - treiman relation @xcite , the low - energy @xmath1 reaction @xcite and @xmath2 photoproduction @xcite .",
    "the flavour - singlet goldberger - treiman relation connects the flavour - singlet axial - charge @xmath16 measured in polarised deep inelastic scattering with the @xmath2nucleon coupling constant @xmath17 . working in the chiral limit it reads @xmath18 where @xmath17 is the @xmath2nucleon coupling constant and @xmath19 is an ozi violating coupling which measures the one particle irreducible coupling of the topological charge density @xmath20 to the nucleon . in eq.(1 ) @xmath21 is the nucleon mass and @xmath22 ( @xmath23gev ) renormalises @xcite the flavour - singlet decay constant .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath19 is , in part , related @xcite to the amount of spin carried by polarised gluons in a polarised proton .",
    "the large mass of the @xmath2 and the small value of @xmath16 @xmath24 extracted from deep inelastic scattering @xcite ( about a @xmath25 ozi suppression ) point to substantial violations of the ozi rule in the flavour - singlet @xmath26 channel @xcite .",
    "a large positive @xmath27 is one possible explanation of the small value of @xmath28 .",
    "it is important to look for other observables which are sensitive to @xmath19 .",
    "ozi violation in the @xmath2nucleon system is a probe of the role of gluons in dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in low - energy qcd .    working with the @xmath5extended chiral lagrangian for low - energy qcd @xcite",

    "this gluonic contribution to the cross - section for @xmath1 is extra to the contributions associated with meson exchange models @xcite .",
    "there is no reason , a priori , to expect it to be small .",
    "what is the phenomenology of this gluonic interaction ?    since glue is flavour - blind the contact interaction ( 3 ) has the same size in both the @xmath1 and @xmath35 reactions .",
    "celsius @xcite have measured the ratio @xmath36 for quasifree @xmath3 production from a deuteron target up to 100 mev above threshold .",
    "they observed that @xmath37 is approximately energy - independent @xmath38 over the whole energy range  see fig.1 .",
    "the value of this ratio signifies a strong isovector exchange contribution to the @xmath3 production mechanism @xcite .",
    "this experiment should be repeated for @xmath2 production .",
    "the cross - section for @xmath1 close to threshold has been measured at cosy @xcite .",
    "following the suggestion in @xcite a new cosy-11 , uppsala university collaboration @xcite has been initiated to carry out the @xmath35 measurement . the more important that the gluon - induced process ( 3 ) is in the @xmath1 reaction the more one would expect @xmath39 to approach unity near threshold after we correct for the final state interaction between the two outgoing nucleons .",
    "( after we turn on the quark masses , the small @xmath40 mixing angle @xmath41 degrees means that the gluonic effect ( 3 ) should be considerably bigger in @xmath2 production than @xmath3 production . )",
    "@xmath2 phenomenology is characterised by large ozi violations .",
    "it is natural to expect large gluonic effects in the @xmath1 process .    in section 2",
    "we give a brief introduction to the u(1 ) problem .",
    "section 3 introduces the chiral lagrangian approach and section 4 makes contact with the experimental data from celsius and cosy .",
    "in classical field theory noether s theorem tells us that there is a conserved current associated with each global symmetry of the lagrangian",
    ". the qcd lagrangian @xmath42 exhibits chiral symmetry for massless quarks : when the quark mass term is turned off the left- and right - handed quark fields do not couple in the lagrangian and transform independently under chiral rotations .",
    "chiral @xmath43 @xmath44 is associated with the isotriplet axial - vector current @xmath45 @xmath46\\ ] ] which is partially conserved @xmath47 the absence of parity doublets in the hadron spectrum tells us that the near - chiral symmetry for light @xmath48 and @xmath49 quarks is spontaneously broken . spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is associated with a non - vanishing chiral condensate @xmath50 the light - mass pion is identified as the corresponding goldstone boson and the current @xmath45 is associated with the pion through pcac @xmath51 taking the divergence equation @xmath52 the pion mass - squared vanishes in the chiral limit as @xmath53 .",
    "this and pcac @xcite are the starting points for chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the non - vanishing chiral condensate also spontaneously breaks the axial u(1 ) symmetry so , naively , one might expect an isosinglet pseudoscalar degenerate with the pion .",
    "the lightest mass isosinglet pseudoscalar is the @xmath3 meson which has a mass of 547 mev .",
    "the puzzle deepens when one considers su(3 ) .",
    "spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking suggests an octet of goldstone bosons associated with chiral @xmath54 plus a singlet boson associated with axial u(1 )  each with mass @xmath55 .",
    "if the @xmath3 is associated with the octet boson then the gell - mann okubo relation @xmath56 is satisfied to within a few percent . extending the theory from @xmath57 to @xmath58 the large strange quark mass induces considerable @xmath3-@xmath2 mixing .",
    "taking @xmath55 the @xmath3 would be approximately an isosinglet light - quark state ( @xmath59 ) degenerate with the pion and the @xmath2 would be approximately a strange quark state @xmath60 with mass about @xmath61 .",
    "that is , the masses for the @xmath3 and @xmath2 mesons with @xmath3-@xmath2 mixing and without extra physical input come out about 300 - 400 mev too small !",
    "this is the axial u(1 ) problem .",
    "the extra physics which is needed to understand the u(1 ) problem are gluon topology and the qcd axial anomaly .",

    "the exact dynamical mechanism how ( non - perturbative ) gluonic degrees of freedom contribute to axial u(1 ) symmetry breaking through the anomaly is still hotly debated @xcite : suggestions include instantons @xcite and possible connections with confinement @xcite .",
    "independent of the detailed qcd dynamics one can construct low - energy effective chiral lagrangians which include the effect of the anomaly and axial u(1 ) symmetry , and use these lagrangians to study low - energy processes involving the @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",

    "the pion decay constant @xmath77mev and @xmath22 renormalises the flavour - singlet decay constant .    when we expand out the lagrangian ( 14 ) the first term contains the kinetic energy term for the pseudoscalar mesons ; the second term contains the meson mass terms before coupling to gluonic degrees of freedom .",
    "the @xmath5 gluonic potential involving the topological charge density is constructed to reproduce the axial anomaly ( 12 ) in the divergence of the gauge - invariantly renormalised axial - vector current and to generate the gluonic contribution to the @xmath3 and @xmath2 masses .",
