    "in this work we wish to study the orbit and spin magnetic dipole strength distribution , both energy - independent and energy - weighted in a deformed nucleus .",
    "our interests are slanted more towards the orbital distribution because of the intense work in recent years on scissors mode excitations @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the best milieux for scissors mode excitations are strongly deformed nuclei .",
    "we pick for our study the nucleus @xmath0 .",
    "the reasons for this choice are two - fold : it is known to be strongly deformed and we can perform a large shell model calculation which includes not only the basic configuration @xmath3@xmath4 but also all @xmath1=@xmath2 excitations . thus we can get a low energy and a high energy strength distribution .",
    "there are of course some atypical properties of @xmath0 .",
    "this nucleus is not stable and therefore is not amenable to the most direct way of reaching scissors modes -inelastic electron or photon scattering .",
    "secondly , being an @xmath5=@xmath6 nucleus , the scissors modes will have isospin @xmath7=@xmath8 , whereas the ground state has isospin zero .",
    "the scissors modes will be at a much higher energy than in a typical heavy deformed nucleus where , despite the fact that the scissors modes are isovector excitations , the @xmath9=@xmath10 states that have been observed have the same isospin as the ground state .",
    "theoretical studies of scissors mode excitations of @xmath5=@xmath6 have been carried out before , e.g. by chaves and poves @xcite for @xmath11 .",
    "they show that the @xmath10 @xmath7=@xmath8 states at rather high excitation energies have all the right properties to be called scissors mode excitations .",
    "we emphasize again that if we were to carry out the shell model calculation in the small model space @xmath3@xmath4 we would not be adding much new to the subject . but by performing a calculation in a larger space we are able to settle some questions about the strength distribution .",
    "another point we wish to pursue is how sensitive are the energies and strength distributions to various parts of the nucleon - nucleon interaction , in particular the spin - orbit and tensor interactions . to this end , we use an interaction which we have used before for other purposes -the schematic interaction of the form    @xmath12    where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 stand for central , spin - orbit and tensor respectively .",
    "the parameters of @xmath16 , for @xmath17=@xmath8 and @xmath18=@xmath8 , were loosely fitted to the matrix elements of the bonn a interaction .",
    "we can vary the strength of the spin - orbit and tensor interactions by varying @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we perform oxbash @xcite calculations for the @xmath9=@xmath19 @xmath7=@xmath20 ground state and @xmath9=@xmath10 @xmath7=@xmath8 states of @xmath0 .",
    "we calculate the b(m1 ) s from the ground state to the @xmath10 states for three cases :    \\(1 ) spin + orbit : = @xmath21=@xmath8 = @xmath22=@xmath20 = @xmath23=@xmath24 = @xmath25=@xmath26 + ( 2 ) spin only : @xmath21=@xmath20 @xmath22=@xmath20 @xmath23=@xmath24 @xmath25=@xmath26 + ( 3 ) orbit only : @xmath21=@xmath8 @xmath22=@xmath20 @xmath23=@xmath20 @xmath25=@xmath20 +    * 2 ( a ) the first @xmath27 states *    in table @xmath28 we present results for energies and b(m1 ) for the first @xmath27 states .",
    "we consider the three different sets of @xmath29 operators as above and various choices of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the spin - orbit and tensor strength .",
    "what emerges from table @xmath28 is that there is a well defined scissors mode in @xmath0 .",
    "if we focus on the orbital column , we see that for a pure central interaction ( @xmath17=@xmath20 , @xmath18=@xmath20 ) , the dominant state is the second one at @xmath30 @xmath31 with a strength @xmath32 .",
    "it can be seen from table @xmath33 that the total orbital strength is @xmath34 so that one gets @xmath35 of the strength concentrated in one state when a central interaction is used .",
    "the orbital @xmath36 of the @xmath30 @xmath31 state has nearly the same value as @xmath36 with the full operator i.e. spin + orbit .",
    "this shows that the mode is dominantly orbital .",
    "when the spin - orbit and tensor interactions are turned on ( @xmath17=@xmath8 , @xmath18=@xmath8 ) , there is some fragmentation of the orbital strength .",
    "the lowest @xmath10 state , at @xmath37 @xmath31 , gets a strength of @xmath38 and the next one , at @xmath39 @xmath31 gets @xmath40 .",
    "the summed strengths of these two states is about the same as in the @xmath17=@xmath20 , @xmath18=@xmath20 ( central only ) case .",
    "further examination shows that this fragmentation is mainly due to the spin - orbit interaction -the tensor interaction is much less important .",
    "note that the other states listed carry negligible strength .    * 2 ( b ) the total strength and energy - weighted strength *    there has been considerable interest in magnetic dipole strength @xmath41 and energy weighted strength @xmath42 distributions . first the interest was more on the spin strength related to quenching of both isovector magnetic dipole strength and the closely related gamow - teller strength .",
    "more recently , there has been a focus on orbital strength and energy weighted strength .",
    "this is related to the experimental observation by w. ziegker @xcite et .",
    "c. rangacharyulu et .",
    "@xcite that there is a close relation between summed magnetic dipole orbital scissors mode strength and electric quadrupole strength @xmath43 from the @xmath9=@xmath19 ground state to the first @xmath44 state in even - even deformed nuclei .",
    "this observation has lead to much theoretical work on energy weighted sum rules , including works of heyde and de coster @xcite , zamick and zheng @xcite , de guerra and zamick @xcite , nojarov @xcite and hamamoto and nazarewicz @xcite .",
    "the above works relate to heavy deformed nuclei where complete @xmath1=@xmath2 shell model calculations are not possible . by here considering a light strongly deformed system @xmath0 , we hope to cast some light on the theoretical works in heavier systems .    in tables",
    "@xmath33 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 we present the total strength and energy - weighted strength .",
    "we do this for the total @xmath29 operator , the spin part , and the orbital part and for various @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "there are many interesting comments to be made about this table .",
    "first of all , both the summed and energy - weighted summed orbital strength is remarkably insensitive to @xmath17 and @xmath18 -that is whether the spin - orbit interaction and/or tensor interaction are present or not present .",
    "the values of the summed strenghts for @xmath47=@xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 are respectively @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 @xmath56 while the corresponding energy weighted numbers are @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xmath61 .",
    "it is especially surprising that when a spin - orbit splitting is introduced within the @xmath62 shell , it has very little effect .",
    "this is undoubtedly due to the fact that @xmath0 is strongly deformed , so the asymptotic wave functions are approximately valid in all cases .    for the spin strength , there is much more sensitivity to the interaction .",
    "it was noted by kurath @xcite that the spin - orbit interaction is very important for magnetic dipole spin interactions -his energy weighted sum rule uses the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "it was noted by zamick , abbas and halemane @xcite that the tensor interaction can also have a large effect provided one allows for ground state correlations in the nucleus .    the results in table @xmath45 support the claims of these authors .",
    "when the tensor interaction is turned off @xmath63 then the summed spin strength @xmath41 without a spin - orbit interaction is @xmath64 @xmath56 . when the spin - orbit interaction is turned on @xmath41 more than triples to @xmath65 @xmath56 .",
    "the corresponding energy - wighted numbers @xmath42 are @xmath66 @xmath61 and @xmath67 @xmath61 .    on the other hand , with the spin - orbit interaction turned off , the value os @xmath41 changes from @xmath64 @xmath56 to @xmath68 @xmath56 when the tensor interaction is turned on and @xmath42 increases by about a factor of four , from @xmath66 @xmath61 to @xmath69 @xmath61 .",
    "as compared with the isovector orbital transition , the isovector spin transition has a factor @xmath70 , which in general makes spin transitions much larger than orbital ones .",
    "however , we see here that the summed orbital strength is comparable -indeed somewhat larger than the summed spin strength .",
    "this is a manifestation of the strong deformation in @xmath0 . in the @xmath71 limit",
    ", the spin transition rates will be zero .",
    "the asymptotic wave functions in the @xmath62 shell become @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 where    @xmath75    the occupied orbits have the quanta in the @xmath76 direction . a transition from @xmath76 to @xmath17 or @xmath18",
    "can not be induced by the spin operator @xmath77 .",
    "* 2 ( c ) the energy - weighted distribution *    we now switch from tables to figures .",
    "we show the cumulative sum of @xmath78 for the total , the spin and the orbital magnetic dipole operators in figures 1 , 2 and 3 , where we consider only the full interaction @xmath17=@xmath8 , @xmath18=@xmath8 .",
    "the curves for other values of @xmath47 are qualitatively similar .",
    "let us first focus on the orbital excitations .",
    "the energy weighted sum shoots up to about @xmath79 @xmath61 , then there is a wide plateau from about @xmath80 @xmath31 to @xmath81 @xmath31 and then a rapid rise to @xmath82 @xmath61 and another plateau .",
    "indeed there is no further change .",
    "we can clearly identify the low - lying strength and the high - lying strength .",
    "the low - lying energy weighted value is about @xmath79 @xmath61 and the total strength is @xmath60 @xmath61 .",
    "there had been a prediction using a simple nilsson model by de guerra and zamick @xcite , @xcite that the high - lying energy weighted strength should equal the low - lying energy weighted strength .",
    "a similar result was obtained by nojarov @xcite with a somewhat different approach .",
    "our shell model calculation gives the high - lying energy weighted strength to be @xmath35 of the low - lying strength , in fair agreement with the previous predictions .",
    "one possible reason for a deviation is that our single - particle splittings are not @xmath83 but rather are implicitly calculated in oxbash with the schematic interaction described in the introduction .",
    "our single - particle splittings are larger than @xmath83 .",
    "our shell model results with a @xmath1=@xmath2 truncation do not support the claim of hamamoto and nazarewicz @xcite that the high lying energy weighted orbital strength should be much larger than the corresponding low lying strength .",
    "our results go somewaht in the other direction .",
    "we end by saying what we feel are the main points of interest in this work .",
    "firstly , from table @xmath46 we see the surprising insensitivity of the orbital scissors mode summed strength @xmath41 or @xmath42 to the presence or absence of the tensor and spin - orbit interactions .",
    "secondly , there are the shapes of the figures of cumulative @xmath42 strength versus excitation energy , with a wide plateau , especially in the orbital case , separating the low lying from the high lying strength .",
