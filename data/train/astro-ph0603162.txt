    "although more than 75 years have passed since hubble s discovery of the expanding universe , there is still some confusion about how the expansion is to be interpreted.@xcite peacock@xcite and whiting@xcite have recently discussed radial motion through space of a free particle in friedmann universe models .",
    "whiting deduced the newtonian equation of motion for a free particle and its relativistic generalization , the geodesic equation , but gave only the general solution of the newtonian equation .",
    "the solutions show that a particle that is initially at rest relative to an observer will move inward and pass the position of the observer before moving outward . whiting and peacock",
    "conclude that this behavior is not in accordance with the usual interpretation that space expands .",
    "several papers ( see for example , refs .   and ) have pointed out that even though the standard newtonian derivation of the friedmann equations ( which govern the expansion of the universe ) gives the correct form of the equations , it rests on shaky foundations .",
    "for example , using the newtonian gravitational force law is not warranted in an infinite , homogeneous universe .",
    "thus we should be wary of using newtonian physics when interpreting the expansion of the universe .",
    "the question whether it is possible to distinguish by observation between the two possibilities : galaxies moving apart or the space between them expanding has been discussed by morgan with emphasis on the observations of the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation.@xcite    the concept of space as used in the general theory of relativity is defined as a relation between reference particles and is different from the concept of space as used in newtonian physics and in the special theory of relativity , where space is not influenced by matter and exists independently of it .",

    "we now consider radial motion .",
    "the only non - vanishing christoffel symbols that are needed are @xmath10 where the dots denote derivatives with respect to coordinate time @xmath11 .",

    "hence @xmath20 is a positive constant . inserting @xmath21 in eq",

    "p. 334 ) @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the present value of the cosmic time .",
    "hence , if we measure the time in units of @xmath28 , and normalize the scale factor to unity at @xmath29 , eq .",

    "hence , regions outside the hubble sphere are receding faster than the speed of light , which makes @xmath34 impossible in this region , if we accept the relativistic requirement of subluminal velocities for material particles .    a plot of the proper distance @xmath48 for a particle starting at @xmath49 for a dust - dominated universe with @xmath50 ( the einstein - de sitter model ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] . the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] show qualitatively the same behavior as found by whiting@xcite by solving the newtonian equation of motion .",
    "the particle is not dragged along with the hubble flow , but falls toward and past the origin , approaching asymptotically the velocity of the hubble flow . as pointed out by whiting@xcite the position of the particle does not go asymptotically to @xmath51 and in that ( somewhat arbitrary ) sense it never rejoins the hubble flow .",
    "the fact that the particle never rejoins the hubble flow is part of the reason why peacock@xcite and whiting@xcite reject the notion of expanding space .",
    "they claim that the notion of expanding space leads us to think that a particle dropped into the hubble flow should , like a particle dropped into a river , start following the local flow",
    ". clearly , a free particle in a friedmann universe does not behave like a particle dropped into a river .    in ref .",
    "the solutions of the geodesic equation are discussed with the following comment : `` the free particle accelerates toward the origin away from the hubble flow , passes through the origin , and continues out the other side .",
    "this behavior of a free particle is not what one would expect , if the ` expansion of space ' acts like a newtonian force pushing the galaxies apart .",
    "it is qualitatively different , the initial velocity being in the opposite direction . ''",
    "note that whiting must be referring to the initial _ acceleration _ , because the particle starts from rest .",
    "we can offer an explanation for this behavior in the context of an expanding space .",
    "differentiating @xmath32 twice and using eq .",
    "( 9 ) leads to @xmath52 and from eq .",
    "( 17 ) we then obtain @xmath53 equation   shows that the particles initial acceleration @xmath54 can be directed inward , even if the overall acceleration of the universe , @xmath55 , is outward .",
    "a free particle will accelerate inward if @xmath56    from eq .",
    "( 24 ) we see that if the expansion of the universe is decelerating , the particle will accelerate toward the observer for every value of @xmath35 , even outside the hubble radius .",
    "however , outside the hubble radius it will first be dragged outward by the superluminal expansion of the universe .",
    "the motion of the particle slows down because of the inward directed acceleration , and the free particle eventually moves toward the observer .",
    "the inequality ( 25 ) can be rewritten so that it shows how the behavior of the test particle depends on the type of cosmic fluid dominating the universe . if we differentiate eq .",
    "( 14 ) , we find @xmath57 we substitute eq .   into eq .",
    "( 25 ) and find that the condition for acceleration toward the observer takes the form @xmath58 for a dust dominated ( @xmath50 ) or radiation dominated ( @xmath59 ) universe , the right - hand side is negative , and eq .",
    "( [ eq : new4 ] ) is satisfied for every value of @xmath35 .",
    "the milne universe has @xmath60 and hence @xmath61 . from eq .",
    "( 24 ) it is seen that a free particle in the milne universe accelerates toward the observer for any value of @xmath35 , although the hubble flow is unaccelerated",
    ".    an accelerating universe has @xmath62 . in this case",
    "the hubble flow accelerates , @xmath63 .",
    "let @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "the condition for acceleration of the free particle toward the observer is then @xmath66 where @xmath35 is less than the hubble radius because @xmath67 . even in this case",
    "the particle will accelerate inward for sufficiently large initial distance , although it may be dragged outward with a velocity after release directed away from the observer because of the cosmic expansion .",
    "the inward directed acceleration of a free particle in a universe with accelerated hubble flow and repulsive gravitation is somewhat surprising and needs explanation .",
    "the general relativistic explanation of this behavior is the following . consider a particle that is not moving freely , but is initially kept at a fixed physical distance from the origin . at the position of the particle space expands so that reference points with fixed values of @xmath2 move outward .",
    "hence , new reference points with smaller values of @xmath2 pass the particle as time proceeds .",
    "the velocity of the reference points is @xmath68 which decreases as @xmath2 decreases .",
    "this decrease means that at a fixed distance from an arbitrarily chosen origin the expansion of space slows down .",
    "this slowing down has nothing to do with the dynamics of the hubble flow , but is due to its inhomogeneity as observed from the origin .",
    "regions with lower expansion velocity move outward .",
    "the particle has an initial peculiar velocity directed inward that is adjusted to a larger velocity of the hubble flow than its later value .",
    "hence , it starts moving inward because of a retarded expansion of space at its position .",
    "davis et al.@xcite have also treated this problem . however , their expression for @xmath69 ( eq .",
    "( 14 ) in ref .  ) lacks the last term of our eq .",
    "the reason is that they have not used the geodesic equation to deduce the equation of motion , but a scaling argument for the momentum . from their equation",
    "they conclude that whether the particle approaches us or recedes from us depends only on the sign of the acceleration of the hubble flow @xmath55 .",
    "as we have shown , this conclusion is not correct .    when discussing the meaning of an expanding universe",
    ", we should bear in mind that physical arguments , like the ones we have given , are usually framed within the homogeneous friedmann - robertson - walker model . to reject the concept of expanding space based on the common - sense observation that space locally , for example , in my room , shows no sign of expanding is not relevant , because the assumption of homogeneity breaks down on small scales . in some idealized models",
    "there is , in principle , an effect of the expansion of space on small scales .",
    "one case that has been studied is a spherical mass distribution embedded in an einstein - de sitter universe@xcite .",
    "it is found that circular orbits around the spherical mass will expand , although at a modest rate ( roughly @xmath70m / year for an orbit of radius of 1 astronomical unit around a solar - mass star ) .",
    "the milne universe is the minkowski spacetime described from an expanding reference frame.@xcite the coordinate transformation between the minkowski coordinates , ( @xmath71 ) and the milne coordinates ( @xmath72 ) is @xmath73 which leads to the line element @xmath74 .",

    "the time @xmath76 is the private time of p. the time @xmath11 is measured on clocks following all of the reference particles . as seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : trafo2 ] ) the space @xmath77 has a finite extent , @xmath78 .",
    "this space is the _ private space _ of an observer following the particle p. the space @xmath79 is represented by a hyperbola in the minkowski diagram of the p observer ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig3 ] ) .",
    "it is defined by simultaneity of the clocks carried by all the reference particles and is called the _ public space _ or only _ the space _ of the universe model .",
    "it has infinite extension in spite of the fact that the big bang has the character of a point event in the milne universe model .    in the inertial and rigid minkowski coordinate system",
    "the velocity of a reference particle with comoving coordinate @xmath2 is @xmath80 which is less than @xmath81 for all values of @xmath2 .",
    "however , in the expanding cosmic frame it is different . here",
    "the velocity of the reference particle as defined by an observer at the origin is given by hubble s law @xmath82 hence the reference particles have superluminal velocity at sufficiently great distances from the observer .",
    "according to special relativistic kinematics superluminal velocity is problematic because the particles can not move through space with a velocity greater than @xmath81 .",
    "however , according to the general relativistic interpretation , the reference particles define the public space of the universe model , and there is no limit to how fast space itself can expand .    in the milne universe model",
    "there exists a global inertial frame that we have called a minkowski frame .",
    "in such a frame the finite extension of the infinite cosmic space is due to the lorentz contraction .",
    "the distances between the reference particles are lorentz contracted relative to the corresponding distances in the milne frame .",
    "the lorentz contraction makes the infinite public space look like a finite private space in the minkowski frame , and makes the velocities of the reference particles less than the velocity of light .",
    "however , in universe models that are not empty , no global minkowski frame exists .",
    "globally , minkowski coordinates , or cartesian coordinates , can describe only the flat tangent space of a curved space .",
    "such coordinates are often called local inertial coordinates and can be defined only in limited neighborhoods of points or world lines.@xcite in curved spacetime there is only the cosmic frame .",
    "the only real space is the public space .",
    "although we have considered homogeneous universe models and the special theory is valid locally , we can not apply a special relativistic kinematics to define the cosmic kinematics globally , which is the main reason that the special relativistic conception of particles moving through space can not be applied to define the expansion of the universe .",
    "the hubble flow has a global cosmic character , and the general theory of relativity is needed to define it properly , which leads to the concept of an expanding space .",
    "in ref .   it is argued that the cosmic redshift should not be interpreted as an expansion effect , but as a curvature effect .",
    "the general formula for the cosmic redshift is @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the emission time of a light signal , and the scale factor has been normalized so that @xmath85 today .",
    "in this section we shall accept the general relativistic interpretation of eq .   according to which",
    "the wavelength of the emitted radiation has been stretched during its travel from the object to the observer by a factor equal to the ratio of the distance between two galaxy clusters at the time of observation and the time of emission .",
    "if , for example , @xmath86 , the distances have been doubled during the time the radiation moved from the source to the observer .",
    "we shall show that the cosmic redshift can be separated into a doppler shift and a gravitational frequency shift if the object is close to the observer , cosmically speaking , that is , if @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the present value of the hubble parameter .",
    "this result was first derived by herman bondi.@xcite alternative derivations can be found in refs .   and .",

    "( 34 ) and making a taylor expansion of @xmath1 to second order in @xmath89 one obtains ( see ref .",

    "if gravity is repulsive and the cosmic expansion accelerates , the gravitational frequency shift is a redshift . in both cases",

    "we now assume that the universe is dominated by dust .",

    "this derivation shows that it is not correct to invoke the doppler effect as an explanation for the cosmic redshift .",
    "it is already contained in the redshift interpreted as an expansion effect .",

    "this velocity is that of the emitter relative to an observer at the position of the emitter , comoving with the hubble flow .",

    "hence , the redshift is in general given by @xmath123 an emitter at rest relative to the observer has a peculiar velocity @xmath124 .",
    "thus the redshift of this emitter is @xmath125 which in general does not vanish .",
    "it has hence been shown that the radiation from an object at a cosmological distance at rest relative to the observer has a non - vanishing redshift , which shows that it is not natural to interpret the redshift as a doppler effect .",
    "a similar result was obtained in ref .  .",
    "einstein once said to heisenberg , `` it is the theory that tells what we observe . ''",
    "@xcite heisenberg said that this idea helped him in arriving at the uncertainty relation when he struggled to find the physical significance of quantum mechanics ( see ref .  ) .",
    "it is no less true in cosmology . to be able to construct a picture of the world that can be expressed by our ordinary language",
    ", we must interpret the observational data within a theory that gives us the concepts to be used in forming this picture .",
    "describing the expansion of the universe we have either a newtonian or special relativistic picture with an absolute space or a general relativistic picture with a dynamical space . according to the newtonian picture the galaxies move through space , but according to the general theory of relativity space expands and the galaxies follow the expanding space .",
    "which picture is most natural  the special relativistic or the general relativistic ?",
    "let us consider hubble s law , which says that the velocity of the galaxies away from us is proportional to their distance from us .",
    "it implies that at sufficiently great distances the velocities become superluminal .",

    "it seems that there is an inconsistency here .",
    "the solution is that hubble s law refers to the general relativistic space defined by simultaneity on the clocks following the reference particles .",

    "we have shown , however , that the general relativistic conception of an expanding space does in fact offer a natural , although not immediately obvious , explanation of the motion of a free particle . introducing an observer into the homogeneous universe breaks the homogeneity .",
    "there is an inhomogeneous hubble flow relative to the observer , where the velocity increases with the distance from the observer .",
    "also the region with a given velocity expands , implying that the velocity of the hubble flow decreases with time at a fixed distance from the observer .",
    "hence , the peculiar velocity towards the observer of a particle initially at rest relative to the observer , is adjusted to a larger expansion velocity of space than the expansion velocity at later times . in other words ,",
    "the acceleration of the particle is directed towards the observer because of the retarded expansion of space at its position .",
    "observational data should be interpreted in as unified a way as possible .",
    "if we interpret the cosmic redshift as a doppler effect , then the emitters are thought of as moving through space .",
    "however , the doppler effect interpretation of the cosmic redshift is valid only in flat spacetime , that is , in the empty milne universe model .",
    "generally , it does not give the full frequency shift . in universe models with matter and energy , spacetime is curved , and there is a cosmic gravitational field .",
    "the effect of this field on the observed frequency of light from distant sources is not included in the doppler effect . as we have shown , both the doppler effect and the gravitational frequency shift are included in the interpretation of the redshift due to the expansion of space during the time the light from a galaxy travels toward us .",
