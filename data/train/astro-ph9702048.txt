    "the x  ray source grs  1915 + 105 was the first galactic object to show superluminal expansion in radio observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "the standard interpretation of this phenomenon in terms of relativistic jets ( @xcite ) unambiguously places the source at a distance @xmath3 kpc , with the jet axis at an angle @xmath4 to the line of sight ( @xcite ) .",
    "grs  1915 + 105 was discovered as an x - ray transient in 1992 ( @xcite ) .",
    "it was found to be in a bright state with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) in april 1996 , and has been bright in x rays since . during this period",
    "it has shown a remarkable richness in its variability behavior .",
    "it showed quasi - periodic oscillations , with frequencies ranging from @xmath5 hz to 67 hz ( @xcite ) . on several occasions",
    "its light curve showed a complicated pattern of dips and rapid transitions between high and low intensity , which repeated on a time scale between 30 and 400 minutes ( @xcite ) .",
    "the source is suspected to be a black hole binary because of its similarities to the other galactic superluminal source gro  j1655 - 40 ( @xcite ) , which has a dynamical mass estimate implying a black hole ( @xcite ) , and because it has often been well above the eddington luminosity for a neutron star . here",
    "we show that the complicated light curve of grs  1915 + 105 can be described by the rapid ( @xmath61 s ) appearance and disappearance of emission from an optically thick inner accretion disk , probably caused by a thermal - viscous instability analogous to that operating in dwarf novae .",
    "the observations discussed here were carried out with the pca on the rossi xte , on 1996 june 19 , september 27 and october 1 to 29 . during these observations",
    "the source was both very luminous ( @xmath7  @xmath8 erg s@xmath2 at @xmath3 kpc in the 250 kev band ) and very variable ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , similar to the observations reported by greiner , morgan , & remillard ( 1996 ) and morgan , remillard , & greiner ( 1997 ) .",
    "the variability is highly complex , but quite structured .",
    "we identify three types of variability ( `` states '' ) from the light curves ( see fig .",
    "1 ) : a _ quiescent _ state at a relatively low count rate and with little variability , an _ outburst _ state at high count rate with strong red - noise variability , and a _ flare _ state where the flux shows rapid alternations between two flux levels which can be extremely complex in shape .",
    "when more than one state is observed within the same observation ( a typical observation spans a few hours ) , the sequence is always the same : quiescent - outburst - flare - quiescent etc . , sometimes with a highly repetitive pattern . in some observations ,",
    "the source is observed in only the quiescent or flaring state , but never only in the outburst state .",
    "these states are similar to the lull , flare and sputter state described in greiner , morgan & remillard ( 1996 ) on the basis of previous observations of the source .    in this letter",
    "we take the observation of 1996 october 7th ( 6:36 to 7:36 ut ; fig .",
    "1 ) as a prototype containing all three states . the highly  organized complex variability also shows up in a plot of hardness ratio versus time ( fig .",
    "1 , bottom panel ) . the count rate and hardness ratio histories can be combined in a hardness - intensity diagram ( fig .",
    "the approximately hyperbolic shape of this plot suggests that to a first approximation , the source can be understood as the superposition of a constant and a varying source , each with nearly constant hardness ratio .",
    "an explicit example of this is seen in the data of fig .",
    "1 ( bottom panel ) , where the hardness ratio varies in a near square  wave pattern as the count rate alternates between a low and high value .",
    "the spectra in these two brightness levels are strikingly different ( inset frame in fig .",
    "2 ) , mainly because of a large excess of emission below 20 kev at high count rate . this would appear to be the varying component invoked above .",
    "we confirmed this idea by the following procedure .",
    "we accumulated x - ray spectra for the quiescent and outburst intervals for the observation of 1996 october 7th ( fig .",
    "2 , inset )",
    ". fits with simple single - component models did not give acceptable results .",
    "we obtained good fits ( reduced @xmath9=1.2 and 0.8 respectively ) with a `` standard '' model for black - hole candidates , consisting of a multi - temperature disk - blackbody plus a power law ( @xcite ) .",
    "the addition of an iron line plus absorption edge was necessary to fit the data around 6 kev .",
    "all fits were performed in the range 2  50  kev , and a 1% systematic uncertainty was added to the data to account for the uncertainties in the response matrix calibration ( @xcite ) .",
    "the best fit parameters , using the known distance and inclination ( we assume that the latter is the same as the inclination of the radio jets to the line of sight ) , are shown in table 1 .",
    "for the outburst state we find a column density n@xmath10 = 8.0@xmath11 @xmath12 , somewhat higher than the rosat value ( 6@xmath11 @xmath12 , see greiner , morgan , & remillard 1996 ) . for the quiescent state we have fixed n@xmath10 to the outburst value .",
    "the marked spectral changes between quiescence and outburst are due to a steepening of the power law component and a large change in temperature of the disk - blackbody . from additional fits to other parts of the light curve and to other observations we find that while the power law index can assume values anywhere in the range 2.33.9 , the inner temperature of the disk - blackbody component switches between two values : @xmath60.5 kev , which corresponds to an inner radius of several hundred kilometers , and @xmath62.2 kev , with an inner radius of @xmath620 km .",
    "this hot disk component switches on at count rates larger than 20000 c / s ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , even during the brief peaks of the oscillating events in the flaring state . below 20000",
    "c / s , the hardness ratio changes in fig .",
    "2 are due primarily to changes in the power - law index .    by looking at the light curve in figure 1 at high time resolution",
    ", one sees that the fastest rise and fall times for the flare state remain constant .",
    "the shortest doubling rise times are @xmath62 s , while the corresponding shortest decay times are significantly less , i.e. 0.5 ",
    "1.0 s. two further characteristic time scales apparent in the x  ray light curve ( cf . fig . 1 )",
    "are the duration of the quiescent state and of a complete quiescent - outburst - flare cycle . for the light curve plotted in fig .  1 ,",
    "these are @xmath6300 s and @xmath13 s , respectively .",
    "if we take the simplest possible interpretation of the multi  temperature blackbodies , i.e. as the emission from optically thick regions of an accretion disk around a compact object of mass @xmath14 , we have @xmath15 km for the brightest state of the varying source , and @xmath16300 km for the constant source . from @xmath17 and @xmath18 we can infer the mass accretion rate according to @xmath19 @xmath20 can not be smaller than the innermost stable orbit around a black hole .",
    "this gives @xmath21 @xmath22 yr@xmath2 in outburst and @xmath23 @xmath22 yr@xmath2 in quiescence for a schwarzschild hole ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "for an extreme kerr hole we have @xmath25 , so @xmath26 , and @xmath27 @xmath22 yr@xmath2 in outburst and @xmath28 @xmath22 yr@xmath2 in quiescence . the fact that the inferred accretion rates anticorrelate with the total luminosity implies that the accretion yield is lower when the accretion rate is high .",
    "this can be accomplished by trapping of the radiation and quasi ",
    "spherical infall ( `` advection '' ) of the accretion energy into a black hole ( cf @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we shall see that the disk interpretation indeed suggests that just this occurs .",
    "we arrive at the following picture .",
    "the `` constant '' source is the emission from the outer parts of the accretion disk .",
    "this component varies only on the long viscous time scales characteristic of the outer disk .",
    "the varying source is the emission from the inner disk region and from a hot comptonizing corona above the disk , whose spectrum varies in response to changes in the disk continuum . as we shall explain below , the inner disk region empties and refills on time scales of seconds , thus causing the rapid flux and spectral changes .",
    "radiation pressure becomes important in the inner region : it exceeds gas pressure for disk radii @xmath29 ( cf @xcite ) . here",
    "@xmath30 is the shakura ",
    "sunyaev viscosity parameter , @xmath31 is the accretion rate in units of @xmath32 g s@xmath2 , and @xmath33 is the black hole mass in units of @xmath34 . in such regions",
    "the disk scale height @xmath35 is almost constant with radius , so that @xmath36 ( cf @xcite ) and the thin disk approximation necessarily breaks down near the inner edge of the disk ( @xmath37 ) . here",
    "@xmath38 is the radial coordinate in units of @xmath39 cm .",
    "thermal balance at a given radius of a disk can be expressed in terms of a relation between the local accretion rate @xmath40 and the surface density @xmath41 .",
    "it is well known that for regions with @xmath42 , the @xmath43 curve has a branch with a negative slope , which is thus thermally and viscously unstable ( @xcite ) . as pointed out by abramowicz et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , lasota & pelat ( 1991 ) and chen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , inward advection of the hot gas in the high @xmath40 state is likely to stabilize the system .",
    "this leads to an s  shaped thermal balance curve in the @xmath44 plane , at typical disk effective temperatures @xmath6 few @xmath45 k on the lower branch .",
    "this is very similar to the familiar thermal balance curve found near the hydrogen ionization temperature @xmath46 k in dwarf nova disks . in the same way as there ,",
    "the disk is locally thermally stable on the branches with positive slope , and locally unstable on the middle branch with negative slope .",
    "we obviously again have the possibility of limit  cycle behavior , this time only in central regions of the disk with temperatures exceeding a few million degrees . cannizzo ( 1996 )",
    "has modeled the variability of the bursting pulsar gro  j174428 ( @xcite ) in these terms . for that source the large assumed value of the inner disk radius ( because of the neutron star magnetic field )",
    "leads to much longer time scales than for grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "we note that the lightman - eardley instability is only expected to operate inside the radius given by eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) , which indeed is close to the inner radius we estimate for the `` constant '' source .    since the upper branch of the s ",
    "curve involves physics which is currently unclear , we confine ourselves to estimating the time scales of the x  ray variation .",
    "after an outburst , the outer disk attempts to refill the central disk via steady inflow on its viscous time scale , initially causing the slow recovery during the quiescent phase .",
    "a brightness rise occurs as a heating wave propagates outwards into the central disk from its inner edge before it has been refilled to a steady  state density profile .",
    "the hot radiating matter is removed by infall into the central black hole on the effective viscous time in the outbursting state .",
    "the latter time is not well known , as the thin disk approximation fails in this state .",
    "heating fronts and infall can alternate many times in the flaring state , before the central disk eventually returns to the quiescent state .",
    "the whole cycle repeats roughly on the viscous time of the outer disk .",
    "we can estimate the expected time scales as follows .",
    "the rise time is the time for the heating wave to pass through the central disk .",
    "assuming that the heating front travels with subsonic velocity , the sound speed @xmath47 being calculated in the cool ( @xmath48 k ) disk state , we get @xmath49 where @xmath50 cm .",
    "the decay time can not be shorter than the free  fall time scale , giving @xmath51 the whole cycle should repeat roughly on the viscous time scale at the outer edge of the central disk , i.e. @xmath52 where we have written the kinematic viscosity as @xmath53 and used ( eqs . [ e2 ] and [ e3 ] ) .",
    "we note that ( eqs .",
    "[ e3 ] and [ e4 ] ) are in rough agreement with the observed rise and decay times @xmath54 s , @xmath55 s , while typical values @xmath56 assumed for quiescent disks imply recurrence times @xmath57 s , quite close to the observed values .",
    "note that the x - ray rise and fall episodes differ from the case considered by cannizzo ( 1996 ) .",
    "there the infall on to the central neutron star is the process which raises the x - ray production rate , whereas here infall causes hot matter to be lost down the black hole , leading eventually to a decay of the x - rays .",
    "we note that the several features of the x - ray light curves strongly resemble the results of dwarf nova disk instability calculations . even though the basic cause of the instability differs here , the general picture of heating and cooling fronts travelling back and forth leads us to expect generic similarities .",
    "in particular , alternating wide and narrow outbursts , and series of narrow outbursts followed by a wide one are common features ( see @xcite , for the outburst width distribution for dwarf novae ) .",
    "these typically result when the heating wave stalls before crossing the entire unstable region .",
    "similarly , a generic prediction of this type of model comes from the fact that the rise and decay episodes are fundamentally asymmetric . when observed with high enough time resolution",
    ", the system should perform a hysteresis loop in an x - ray color - color diagram .",
    "unfortunately , the large variations in the power law component do not currently allow one to draw a conclusion from simple color - color plots .",
    "the accumulation of high time resolution energy spectra , not available in the current data , will allow one to test for the presence of such a hysteresis loop .",
    "a full quantitative discussion will be presented in a future paper .",
    "the extremely high values of the mass accretion rate we infer from the spectral fits in the quiescent state do not lead to a correspondingly high x - ray luminosity generation in the inner disk ( with a canonical efficiency of 0.2 c@xmath58 per gram one would have expected an x - ray luminosity in excess of 10@xmath59 erg / s ) .",
    "this indicates that a major fraction of the gravitational energy released in the inner disk is not emitted as radiation , suggestive of advection into a black hole .",
    "assuming that the accretion rates derived from our spectral model are essentially correct and that ejection is relatively unimportant , a substantial fraction of the inflow disappears into the central object without broadcasting a signal to the outside world .",
    "this supports the idea that it does not have a solid surface , and thus has the most characteristic property of a black hole .",
    "we note that the interpretation proposed in this paper depends on the spectral model we have used .",
    "we emphasize that at this point it is difficult to exclude absolutely the possibility that the compact object in grs  1915 + 105 is a neutron star , as the study of x - ray spectra of neutron stars accreting at a hyper  eddington rate is fairly unexplored .",
    "however , a black hole surrounded by an optically thick accretion disk of variable inner radius provides a natural explanation for the otherwise apparently intractable phenomenology presented by grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "it is improbable that the high inferred accretion rate represents the high state of some much longer - term instability in the outer disk .",
    "it seems more likely that the mass transfer rate is always very high , and that the outbursts of grs  1915 + 105 are not caused by an increase of the mass transfer rate , but quite possibly by a decrease from a value high enough to smother the x - ray emission . in the smothered state ,",
    "the object would then appear only as a bright infrared source .",
    "average mass transfer rates of the required order ( @xmath60@xmath61/yr ) can easily be supplied for example by a donor star crossing the hertzsprung gap , and thus undergoing thermal  timescale radius expansion ( @xcite ) .",
