    "in the last decade advances in the fabrication of nano - devices enabled to connect quantum dots with superconducting ( sc ) leads forming superconducting quantum dot nanostructures generalizing the conventional josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "many experimental realizations of this concept using various bcs materials for the superconducting leads ( _ al _ , _ pb _ , or _ nb _ ) and a great variety of quantum dots formed in semiconducting nanowires@xcite or dots,@xcite carbon nanotubes,@xcite or even single @xmath2 molecules@xcite demonstrate the versatility of such setups .",
    "major advantage of the superconducting quantum dots over conventional microscopic josephson junctions lies in the possibility of a detailed control of their microscopic parameters , e.g. , by tuning the onsite energy by a gate voltage .",
    "such a high tunability is promising for potential applications of these hybrids in the nanoelectronics ( e.g. , as a superconducting single - electron transistor ) or quantum computing as well as for detailed studies of their non - trivial physical properties .",
    "these include josephson supercurrent , andreev subgap transport and the way they are influenced by the zero - dimensional nature of the superconducting quantum dots with finite - size quantized levels and potentially strong effects of the local coulomb interaction leading to strongly correlated phenomena such as the kondo effect.@xcite in many cases the system can be very well described by a simplest single impurity anderson model ( siam ) coupled to bcs leads,@xcite which , depending on particular parameters , may exhibit so called @xmath0 transition signaled by the sign reversal of the supercurrent.@xcite the @xmath0 transition is induced by the underlying impurity quantum phase transition ( qpt ) related to the crossing of the lowest many - body eigenstates of the system from a spin - singlet ground state with positive supercurrent ( @xmath1-phase ) to a spin - doublet state with negative supercurrent ( @xmath3-phase).@xcite in single - particle spectral properties this transition is associated with crossing of the andreev bound states ( abs ) at the fermi energy as has also been observed experimentally.@xcite    a number of theoretical techniques have been used to address the @xmath0 transition and related properties of superconducting quantum dots .",
    "a very good quantitative agreement with the experiments@xcite can be obtained in a wide range of parameters using heavy numerics such as numerical renormalization group ( nrg)@xcite and quantum monte carlo ( qmc).@xcite however , both nrg and qmc are time and computational resources consuming . alternative ( semi)analytical methods based on various , often quite sophisticated , perturbation approaches either around non - interacting limit ( @xmath4 ) such as the mean - field theory,@xcite slave particles,@xcite and functional renormalization group ( frg)@xcite or around the atomic limit ( @xmath5 or @xmath6)@xcite have been used for qualitative and in some limits even a quantitative description of the superconducting quantum dot properties . yet , none of the mentioned methods with the exception of the mean - field / hatree - fock ( hf ) approximation are sufficiently simple and at the same time versatile to serve as a generic ( semi)analytical solver .",
    "hf approximation has the attributes of the generic method,@xcite yet , it suffers from fundamental conceptual problems , namely , it identifies the @xmath0 transition with the point of breaking of the spin - symmetric solution and attributes the @xmath3 phase to the magnetic solution of the self - consistent hf equations .",
    "this unphysical breaking of the spin symmetry together with the ensuing discontinuities of various physical quantities even at non - zero temperatures contradicting the experimental observations disqualify the unrestricted hf approach as a reliable solver for the superconducting siam .",
    "surprisingly , with the exception of a few fragmented precursors,@xcite it has not been noticed until very recently@xcite that the resummed perturbation theory incorporating second - order dynamical corrections to the spin - symmetric hf solution yields at zero temperature a nearly perfect description of the @xmath1 phase for symmetric leads in a wide range of parameters .",
    "the aim of this work is to demonstrate that second - order perturbation theory is an efficient and reliable method not only for the symmetric leads , but also for a more general and realistic case of asymmetric tunnel coupling to different leads ( i.e. , with various values of superconducting gaps ) .",
    "this method is numerically much less expensive than nrg or qmc .",
    "note that in the general case one has to deal with the two - channel anderson model , therefore , the introduced second - order perturbation theory can be 10 or even 100 times faster ( depending on parameters and used cpu cores ) than the fully convergent nrg calculations .",
    "simultaneously , this method gives nearly perfect results for the physical quantities in the @xmath1-phase at zero temperature in a wide range of parameters corresponding to weakly- and intermediately correlated regime , where the conventional deployment of nrg is unnecessary .",
    "as known from previous studies@xcite the ground - state in this regime is the bcs singlet in contrast to the strongly correlated regime where the ground state is the kondo singlet .",
    "we illustrate this in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - diagram - intro ] which depicts the ground state phase diagram in the @xmath7 plane for quantum dots with symmetric leads at half - filling .",
    "the crossover region between the bcs and kondo singlets is approximately plotted as a gray stripe .",
    "the bcs singlet regime covers a broad range of parameters ( note the logarithmic scale on the vertical axis ) where second - order perturbation theory is in a nearly perfect agreement with nrg .",
    "thus , we advocate this method to be the generic first - choice solver for the properties of the @xmath1 phase .",

    "full red line separates the singlet and doublet ground states and the shade region signals the crossover between the two kinds of singlet ground states .",

    "[ fig : phd_u_delta ] and [ fig : one - particle - quantities ] below .",

    "we identified the limits of applicability of our method by direct comparison with nrg data obtained via the nrg ljubljana open source code.@xcite at small enough temperatures , the boundary depends only weakly on temperature@xcite and , therefore , our zero - temperature results are directly applicable to the existing experimental data .",
    "we finally compared our predictions with two experiments with excellent agreement , further justifying our claims .",
