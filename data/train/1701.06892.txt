    "it is noticed that without choosing any specific value of hubble parameter , it is impossible to obtain the explicit form of field potential . for this reason , we consider the hubble parameter for barotropic fluid , the cosmological constant and the chaplygin gas matter contents in separate cases . in literature , the scalar field potentials which usually studied are positive and inverse power laws , exponential and logarithmic potentials @xcite , whereas others are different combinations of these functions .    in de - sitter models , we have found the form of potential by reconstruction in terms of scalar field .",
    "we have found the scale factor in terms of scalar field with negative power in all cases of de - sitter and in case of power law models , we can not get the explicit potential but using barotropic fluid , cosmological constant and chaplygin gas matter content with @xmath207 , we have found the explicit form of scalar field potential .",
