    "design of systems for point - to - point communication of analog data over noisy communication channels has a theoretical basis in shannon s separation theorem .",
    "the theorem gives a bound on the optimal performance theoretically achievable ( opta ) by any communication system .",
    "specifically , it says that the distortion can not be made smaller than @xmath0 , which can be obtained from @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the rate - distortion function , which is given by the source statistics and the distortion measure , and @xmath3 is the channel capacity . under appropriate assumptions",
    ", the separation theorem also shows that it is possible to come arbitrarily close to @xmath0 by the combination of source coding and channel coding .",
    "these codes can , in principle , be independently developed without loss .",
    "this means that the channel code designer does not need to know anything about the source , and vice - versa , which is clearly a practical advantage .",
    "the separation theorem does , however , rely on asymptotic arguments where the delay and the size of the codebook are allowed to increase indefinitely .",
    "consequently , it does not hold in presence of delay or complexity constraints and imposing such constraints generally renders the distortion bound unachievable . since infinitely",
    "large delays or codebooks are not possible in practice , a suboptimal performance may have to be accepted . moreover , to minimize the distortion in the presence of these constraints",
    ", it may be necessary to abandon the separation - based design and consider joint source - channel codes .",
    "this is the subject of the present paper , where we consider transmission of a stationary colored gaussian source over a power - constrained channel with additive colored gaussian noise , under the mean - square error ( mse ) distortion criterion .",
    "the encoder and decoder are constrained to be causal and their combined operations are subject to a delay constraint .",
    "further , we allow for the possibility of a remote ( noisy ) source .",
    "the situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : comm_system ] .     plus",
    "the measurement noise @xmath4 and transmits @xmath5 over the channel .",
    "the decoder receives @xmath5 plus the channel noise @xmath6 and forms @xmath7 , the estimate of @xmath8 .",
    "each source element has to be estimated after a given delay in order to minimize the error @xmath9 . ]",
    "the encoder and decoder will be restricted to the class of linear and time - invariant ( lti ) filters . the linearity assumption and",
    "the additive noise models allow us to formulate the distortion minimization as a transfer function optimization problem .",
    "the main result is that a jointly optimal encoder - decoder pair from the lti class can be found by first minimizing a functional of the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are given transfer functions and @xmath13 is the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , over @xmath14 .",
    "the encoder and decoder are then obtained from a spectral factorization .",
    "a corresponding result is also shown to hold in the case with vector - valued signals and parallel additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channels .",
    "the restriction to linear encoders and decoders may obviously result in suboptimal solutions .",
    "nevertheless , the linear solution to any problem instance will provide an upper bound to the minimum distortion possible for the given snr , delay constraint , and signal spectra .",
    "moreover , the proposed design methods are relatively simple and computationally feasible .",
    "an application where this problem formulation could be relevant is the transmission of speech in mobile communication .",
    "the source signal to be estimated at the receiver is the speech signal .",
    "the delay constraint is based on the acceptable latency and the noise is any background sound present at the microphone .",
    "the rest of this section will present the relevant previous research and alternative interpretations of the problem .",
    "section [ sec : notation ] presents the mathematical notation used in this paper .",
    "the exact problem formulation is given in section [ sec : problemformulation ] .",
    "section [ sec : solution ] is devoted to the solution of the problem , first in the scalar and then in the vector case , followed by a theorem stating that optimal lti encoders and decoders require infinite memory .",
    "section [ sec : numerics ] presents a procedure for numerical solution and a numerical example where the performance of the optimal lti encoders and decoders is compared to the lower bound provided by the separation theorem .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] presents the conclusions and discusses further research .",
    "some technical lemmas have been put in the appendix .",
    "the problem studied in this paper is closely related to that of finding the optimal modulation matrices for linear coding and decoding of a gaussian vector source for transmission over a gaussian vector channel .",
    "optimal modulation matrices were derived in @xcite , where it was also shown that linear modulation is only optimal when the source and channel can be matched .",
    "that is , when their dimensions match and the source and channel noise covariance matrices can be diagonalized into uniform variances . the same problem was considered in @xcite , where the solution was also given for the case when the channel components have individual power constraints .",
    "the performance of optimal linear coding was compared , for a number of cases , to the opta , given by ( [ eq : minimum_distortion ] ) , in @xcite .",
    "the general suboptimality of linear coding arises from the fact that it can not match any colored gaussian source to any colored gaussian channel .",
    "it has recently been shown , however , that such matching can be achieved by the combination of prediction and modulo - lattice operations @xcite .",
    "the problem of coding with a remote source was first considered for the gaussian case with additive noise and mse distortion in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the problem is asymptotically equivalent to , and can thus be reduced to , the fully observed case and that an optimal encoder generally has a structure consisting of an optimal estimator followed by optimal encoding for a noise - free source .",
    "this structural result was generalized to the non - gaussian and finite time horizon cases in @xcite .",
    "the problem was further studied in @xcite , where it was noted that in the case of white source noise , the criterion in the reduced problem is given by the conditional expectation of the original criterion given the encoder input .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite that the equivalence in @xcite actually was proved for the one - shot problem as well .",
    "moreover , it was shown that the reduction to the non - remote problem follows from a general `` disconnection principle '' . in the literature ,",
    "the problem of coding with a remote source often includes the possibility of noise at the receiver as well .",
    "the main motivation for excluding that possibility here is the fact , noted in @xcite , that the optimality of an encoder - decoder design is independent of additive and independent zero - mean noise at the receiver .",
    "coding problems with delay constraints have not received the same level of attention as their classical counterparts .",
    "some structural results have , however , been obtained .",
    "the optimal causal source coder for a white source has been found to be memoryless @xcite . for a markov source of order @xmath15 and delay constraint @xmath16",
    ", an optimal real - time source coder only needs to use the last @xmath17 source symbols plus the current state of the decoder .",
    "no such memory bound is given , however , when the encoder does not have access to the decoder state @xcite .",
    "joint source - channel coding with noiseless feedback was considered for finite alphabet sources in @xcite where it was demonstrated that feedback is useful in general , but that coding is useless for a class of channels with a certain symmetry property .",
    "the results in @xcite have been generalized in @xcite , which also gives a nice overview of the literature on real - time coding .",
    "conditions have also been found for when optimal performance can be achieved without coding ( even when allowing coding systems with arbitrary delay ) @xcite .    since the opta given by ( [ eq : minimum_distortion ] ) can not generally be achieved in the presence of delay constraints ,",
    "a relevant question to ask is of course what the opta is when there are such constraints .",
    "a partial answer in the form of upper bounds on the rate - distortion functions for zero - delay and causal source coding is given in the recent paper @xcite .",
    "interestingly , some of the results in that paper are obtained by solving a problem which is somewhat similar to the one considered in this paper .",
    "the solution of that problem can be applied to solve some particular instances of the problem considered in this paper .",
    "the main difference is that they assume that the encoder has access to noiseless feedback from the channel output .",
    "moreover , only the scalar case with zero delay constraint and no noise at the source is considered . the same problem has previously been considered in @xcite as a means to design optimal scalar feedback quantization schemes .",
    "real - time source coding for a remote source has been considered in @xcite .",
    "the structural results of @xcite were extended to cover remote sources in @xcite , which also presented a separation result for the linear - quadratic gaussian case similar to the one in @xcite .",
    "a method for design of optimal real - time coding systems for noisy channels was presented in @xcite using noisy feedback and in @xcite without feedback .",
    "however , there seems to be no method for efficient numerical application of the solution .",
    "it is possible to make two alternative interpretations of the problem illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : comm_system ] .",
    "the problem of estimating a signal that is measured with additive noise under an mse criterion is solved by the wiener filter @xcite .",
    "the filter is usually obtained by solving the wiener - hopf equations , but can also be expressed in the frequency domain as the stable filter @xmath18 that minimizes @xmath19 where @xmath16 is the allowed time delay and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are transfer functions that represent the frequency characteristics of the signal of interest and the measurement noise , respectively .",
    "it is possible to interpret the problem in fig .",
    "[ fig : comm_system ] as a distributed wiener filtering problem , where the filter is separated into two different locations .",
    "the communication channel is used to model the communication constraint between the two locations .",
    "this interpretation is strengthened by the fact that minimization of ( [ eq : wienercost ] ) is equivalent to minimizing @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the same transfer function as in ( [ eq : mainresultfunctional ] ) , over @xmath14 . comparing ( [ eq : wienercost2 ] ) with ( [ eq : mainresultfunctional ] )",
    "it is seen that the cost in the present problem is equal to the cost in a wiener filtering problem plus an additional term , which is induced by the communication channel . since the coefficient of the new term is the inverse of the channel s snr , the cost is asymptotically equal to that in the wiener filtering problem when the snr tends to infinity .      fig .",
    "[ fig : comm_system ] may be interpreted as follows : the source signal is a disturbance that will affect some system where a controller ( the decoder ) can compensate .",
    "the controller has a remote sensor that measures the disturbance and transmits information to the controller over the channel . in this interpretation",
    "the delay block may also include any dynamics that the disturbance passes through on the way .",
    "a similar interpretation was discussed in @xcite .",
    "a similar problem setup was studied in @xcite , where information theory was used to find a lower bound on the reduction of entropy rate made possible by side information communicated through a general channel with known capacity . under stationarity assumptions ,",
    "this was used to derive a lower bound , which is a generalization of bode s integral equation , on a sensitivity - like function .",
    "the techniques in this paper rely on concepts from functional analysis , such as @xmath24 ( lebesgue ) , @xmath25 ( hardy ) and @xmath26 ( smirnov ) function classes and inner - outer factorizations . to conserve space , only some of the most important facts will be given here .",

    "the arguments of transfer matrices will often be omitted when they are clear from the context .",
    "equalities and inequalities involving functions evaluated on @xmath28 are to be interpreted as holding almost everywhere on @xmath28 .",

    "it will now be shown that a necessary condition for the minimum can not be satisfied by a rational @xmath127 except in some special cases . to begin with ,",
    "two simple observations are made :    1 .",
    "if the solution @xmath127 to ( [ eq : minsum ] ) is a rational function it can be factorized into inner - outer factors as @xmath274 .",
    "the outer factor @xmath275 is then a rational function that solves the optimization problem @xmath276 where @xmath277 is a rational function .",
    "thus , we can assume without loss of generality that the optimal solution @xmath127 is outer .",
    "2 .   due to the orthogonality @xmath278 where @xmath279 is a decomposition of @xmath23 into the analytical and anti - analytical parts , respectively",
    ", we can also assume that @xmath23 is analytical since the anti - analytical part does not affect the optimization .",
    "that is , @xmath280 .",
    "another assumption we make to simplify",
    "the proof is that the function @xmath23 has only simple poles .",
    "note that the poles of @xmath281 are the same as of @xmath282 , so the simplicity of the poles remains true through the two rewritings above .",
    "consider the problem ( [ eq : minsum ] ) with a proper non - constant rational function @xmath283 and assume that the poles of @xmath23 are simple and that the optimal solution @xmath127 is not identically zero .",
    "then @xmath127 is not a rational function .",
    "we split the proof into several steps to underline the structure .",
    "step 1 : calculate the first variation of the functional @xmath284 and state the euler - lagrange equation .",
    "the standard differentiation of @xmath285 with respect to @xmath286 and then setting @xmath287 gives @xmath288 for convex problems the necessary and sufficient condition for the minimum is that @xmath289 for all @xmath290 .",
    "it gives the euler - lagrange equation for the optimal @xmath127 as @xmath291 where @xmath292 is the standard orthogonal projection from @xmath131 to @xmath169 .",
    "note that the constant @xmath293 can be incorporated into @xmath127 and @xmath23 without affecting their rationality .",
    "so in the following we assume without loss of generality that this constant is equal to @xmath294 and analyze the equation @xmath295 since @xmath127 is not identically zero , it is not zero almost everywhere on @xmath28 and the fraction @xmath296 is well defined .",
    "step 2 : we will now assume that the solution @xmath14 to ( [ eq : el ] ) is rational and show that it will lead us to a contradiction .",
    "in this step we prove that rationality of @xmath23 and @xmath127 in ( [ eq : el ] ) implies rationality of @xmath297 .",
    "indeed @xmath298 the second term in the right hand side is anti - analytical , hence @xmath299 clearly @xmath300 is rational due to ( [ eq : el ] ) and thus the right hand side of ( [ eq : projection_of_abs_x ] ) is rational too .",
    "accordingly , @xmath301 is also rational .",
    "furthermore , the function @xmath297 is real and has a symmetric laurent series .",
    "therefore , the function @xmath297 must be rational itself .",
    "factorization as @xmath302 with an outer rational @xmath290 and assuming , as was explained previously , that @xmath127 is outer , gives the only possibility that @xmath303 .",
    "that is , the rational solution @xmath127 must be a square of a rational function .",
    "step 3 : rewrite the euler - lagrange equation in terms of @xmath304 and then in terms of numerators and denominators of @xmath304 and @xmath23 . substituting @xmath303 into ( [ eq : el ] ) gives @xmath305 introduce the notations for the numerators and the denominators @xmath306 where @xmath307 , @xmath308 , @xmath309 and @xmath310 are polynomials .",
    "the polynomials @xmath307 , @xmath309 and @xmath310 are stable by definition , since @xmath283 and @xmath304 is outer in @xmath169 .",
    "introduce the notation for the conjugate polynomial to @xmath309 as @xmath311 where @xmath6 is the degree of @xmath309 .",
    "the conjugate of a stable polynomial has the same degree and is anti - stable . with these notations in mind",
    "the euler - lagrange equation becomes @xmath312 here @xmath6 and @xmath4 are degrees of @xmath309 and @xmath310 respectively .",
    "step 4 : calculate the projection in the left hand side of ( [ eq : elnd ] ) and state the polynomial version of the euler - lagrange equation .",
    "we assume now that @xmath313 and cover the opposite in the next step . perform the partial fraction decomposition @xmath314 where @xmath315 is a polynomial and the degree of @xmath44 is less than @xmath6",
    ". then @xmath316 and the equation ( [ eq : elnd ] ) becomes @xmath317 clearly @xmath318 implies @xmath319 since @xmath309 and @xmath310 are prime , hence @xmath320 where @xmath321 is a polynomial . canceling @xmath310 above we get @xmath322 similarly @xmath318 implies @xmath323 and thus @xmath324 .",
    "canceling again gives @xmath325 now it is clear that @xmath326 since otherwise @xmath327 would give @xmath328 , which is impossible since @xmath307 and @xmath308 are also prime . finally , we have @xmath329 , which contradicts the assumption that zeros of @xmath307 are simple unless @xmath330 . but for a proper non - constant @xmath23",
    "it is impossible .",
    "step 5 : the case @xmath331 is similar .",
    "denote @xmath332 .",
    "the only difference is in the partial fraction decomposition @xmath333 where @xmath315 is a polynomial and the degree of @xmath44 is less than @xmath334 .",
    "the rest is exactly the same as in step  4 with the same conclusion that @xmath329 which contradicts the assumption .",
    "because @xmath335 and @xmath54 are assumed to be rational and @xmath122 it follows that @xmath18 is rational if and only if @xmath127 is rational . clearly ,",
    "if @xmath18 is not rational , it can not be factorized as @xmath82 with rational @xmath56 and @xmath57 . thus , the transfer functions of optimal lti encoders and decoders are not rational .",
    "as explained previously , this means that the filters can not be realized using finite memory .",
    "obviously , approximations have to be done for practical implementation .",
    "for example , impulse responses of the filters may be truncated .",
    "it remains to investigate the impact on the performance of such approximations .    if the channel has noise - free feedback , that is , if @xmath56 has access to the channel output , then @xmath56 can estimate the states of @xmath57 exactly .",
    "it would be interesting to study if the memory of optimal linear encoders and decoders could be bounded in this case .",
    "such a result would also be in line with the structural result for causal coders in @xcite , where the memory was bounded given that the encoder has knowledge of the decoder state .",
    "a procedure for obtaining an approximate numerical solution will now be outlined for the vector version of the problem .    1 .",
    "the first step is to solve the optimization problem ( [ kcost_mimo ] ) or , alternatively , minimize ( [ eq : coding_rho ] ) ( the constant part @xmath121 must then be added to obtain the distortion ) .",
    "an approximate solution can be obtained by using a finite basis representation of @xmath18 and approximating the integrals by sums over a finite number of frequency grid points .",
    "such an approximated problem can be cast as a quadratic program with second - order cone constraints .",
    "2 .   perform a matrix spectral factorization of @xmath336 to obtain @xmath78 with @xmath74 .",
    "3 .   perform an inner - outer factorization of @xmath18 to obtain @xmath337 .",
    "4 .   perform a singular value decomposition of @xmath197 to obtain @xmath338 .",
    "5 .   use a finite basis approximation @xmath339 of @xmath229 , for example using the parametrization @xmath340 and fit @xmath339 to @xmath341 by minimizing the deviation in some suitable norm .",
    "perform a spectral factorization of @xmath339 , choosing @xmath246 as the stable and outer spectral factor .",
    "let @xmath342 and @xmath343 .",
    "if @xmath56 and @xmath57 are of incorrect size , add rows of zeros to @xmath56 and columns of zeros to @xmath57 until they are of correct size .",
    "in the scalar case , the procedure is simplified as follows : step 2 and 6 requires only scalar spectral factorizations , step 3 , 4 and 8 are skipped and step 5 consists of fitting @xmath339 to @xmath344      the numerical solution is illustrated by the following example .",
    "consider the problem with @xmath345 , @xmath346 , @xmath347 and @xmath348 .",
    "the functional @xmath130 , given by ( [ eq : coding_rho ] ) , was approximated by discretization of the integrals over @xmath349 grid points , uniformly placed on the unit circle .",
    "@xmath127 was parametrized as an fir filter with @xmath350 coefficients .",
    "the minimization was then carried out for different snr levels @xmath13 and delays @xmath16 , using matlab , yalmip @xcite and sedumi @xcite .",
    "the resulting mse distortion levels are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : performance ] together with the opta for the case with no delay constraint , obtained from ( [ eq : minimum_distortion ] ) .",
    "it can be seen that for small snr s , the distortion is very close to the lower bound .",
    "this is not surprising since for zero snr , the minimum distortion is @xmath351 over any type of coding system . for medium snr s ,",
    "the distortion is lower for longer delays .",
    "the difference seems , however , to decrease when the snr becomes larger .",
    "the gap to the opta seems to approach about a factor two for high snr s , regardless of delay .",
    "this suggests that for this source , it is the linearity , rather than the delay constraint , that is the performance - limiting factor for high snr levels .    , @xmath346 , @xmath347 , @xmath348 ) ]",
    "this paper has shown how to find optimal lti encoders and decoders for joint source - channel coding for gaussian sources and channels .",
    "it has also been shown that such encoders and decoders in general require infinite memory .",
    "thus , some approximation has to be done for numerical solution of the problem",
    ". it would be interesting to investigate if the performance loss due to such approximations can be somehow bounded .    in the scalar case ,",
    "the solution has been extended to handle channels with feedback @xcite .",
    "this is not presented here to conserve space .",
    "another extension is the problem of feedback control over awgn channels , which will be the topic of an upcoming paper .",
    "possible topics for further research includes extending the solution in the mimo case to channels with colored noise , investigating memory bounds when the channel has feedback and the suboptimality of linear solutions .",

    "@xmath355 by theorem 10 in @xcite .",
