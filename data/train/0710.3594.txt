    ".    however , the preliminary na49 results on the energy dependence of transverse momentum fluctuations over the whole sps energy range manifests an unexpected effect : the @xmath0 measure shows a different behavior for different charge selections ( see @xcite and fig .",
    "[ fipt_urqmd_onlyone ] ) .",
    "the @xmath0 is independent of energy and it is consistent with zero for negatively charged particles , but it significantly increases for lower sps energies for both all charged and positively charged particles .    in this work",
    "it will be shown that the effect observed by the na49 experiment is connected with protons only , and it can be explained by event - by - event impact parameter fluctuations or - more precisely - by a correlation between the number of protons in the forward hemisphere and the number of protons that are closer to the production region .",
    "the final conclusions from this analysis are important for all experiments measuring event - by - event fluctuations , especially for those that are using all charged particles in the analysis .",
    "it is also important for detectors with acceptances extending to the beam / target spectator domain . due to a specific choice of the rapidity region ( midrapidity only ) the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic )",
    "experiments appear to be rather insensitive to the effects of impact parameter fluctuations - even if the analysis is performed by use of all charged particles registered in the detectors .",
    "the analysis presented in this article is based on preliminary na49 results @xcite and on events generated within the urqmd approach @xcite .",
    "following the authors of @xcite one defines a single - particle variable @xmath6 with the overbar denoting averaging over a single - particle inclusive distribution .",

    "there are two most important properties of the @xmath0 measure .",
    "if the system consists of particles that are emitted independently from each other ( no interparticle correlations ) @xmath0 equals zero . on the other hand ,",
    "if a+a is an incoherent superposition of many independent n+n interactions ( superposition model ) , then @xmath0 is independent of centrality and it has the same value for a+a and n+n collisions .    several effects may lead to nonzero value of @xmath0 . among them",
    "are those that occur on an event - by - event basis ( event - by - event fluctuations of the inverse slope parameter , existence of different event classes , i.e. , `` plasma '' and `` normal '' events ) , but there are also interparticle correlations due to bose - einstein statistics , coulomb effects , resonance decays , flow , jet production , etc .",
    "to study the energy dependence of transverse momentum fluctuations the na49 experiment used samples of central pb+pb collisions at 20@xmath14 , 30@xmath14 , 40@xmath14 , 80@xmath14 and 158@xmath14 gev energy , corresponding to @xmath15 = 6.27 , 7.62 , 8.73 , 12.3 , and 17.3 gev , respectively .",

    "range the azimuthal angle acceptance of the na49 detector - ( @xmath20 ) - is not uniform and it is described by the analytical curves given in @xcite . additionally , it was demonstrated @xcite that at lower sps energies , the na49 tpc acceptance extends to the projectile spectator domain and therefore the sample of particles can be contaminated by beam particles . for energies above 80@xmath14 gev the beam region and the region of particles - accepted by the na49 for @xmath4 fluctuations analysis - do not overlap .",

    "the @xmath0 values measured by the na49 experiment are compared to the predictions of the urqmd model @xcite .",
    "the urqmd generator is a microscopic transport model producing hadrons via formation , decay , and rescattering of resonances and strings .",
    "the urqmd approach simulates multiple interactions of both target / beam nucleons and newly produced particles , excitation , and fragmentation of color strings and the formation and decay of hadronic resonances . in this",
    "analysis default parameters of the model have been used ( meson - meson and meson - baryon scattering included ) . for each energy , from the sample of minimum bias pb+pb events , the most central 7.2% interactions have been selected , similarly as in the real na49 events .",
    "such selection corresponds to the impact parameter range @xmath21 fm ( in the generated histogram of impact parameter values the number of entries @xmath22 was set as proportional to @xmath23 [ fm ] ) .    the na49 experiment used all charged particles , originating from the main vertex , to determine the @xmath0 measure .",
    "it means practically that only main vertex pions , protons , and kaons and their antiparticles were used in the analysis , because particles coming from the decays of @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are believed to be rejected by a set of track selection criteria .",
    "therefore the analysis of the urqmd events has been carried out also by use of all charged pions , protons , and kaons and their antiparticles . in the analysis of the urqmd events the same kinematic and acceptance restrictions",
    "have been applied as in the case of the na49 data . in principle , the selected @xmath4 - azimuthal angle acceptance ( @xmath28 ) is common for all five sps energies and it corresponds to the restrictions used in the na49 analysis ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "[ fipt_urqmd_onlyone ] presents the comparison of the @xmath0 versus energy for the preliminary na49 data ( points ) and for the urqmd model ( lines ) .",

    "the urqmd model confirms a significant decrease of transverse momentum fluctuations with increasing energy for positively charged particles . on the other hand , there is no energy dependence of @xmath0 for negatively charged particles . in the previous article of the na49",
    "@xcite the system size dependence of transverse momentum fluctuations was studied and a nonmonotonic structure of @xmath0 appeared , but the shape of this dependence was very similar for all three charge selections .",
    "therefore , the fact that the energy dependence of @xmath0 is qualitatively different for various charge selections seems to be quite surprising . as the @xmath0 value for all charged particles",
    "can be treated as a nontrivial combination of @xmath0 for negatively and positively charged particles ( additional sources of fluctuations , however , are not excluded ) , a main emphasis should be placed on understanding the qualitative difference between positively and negatively charged particles .",
    "it should be also stressed that , - although the same kinematic and acceptance restrictions are used for the preliminary na49 data and for the urqmd events , - the @xmath0 values should not be directly compared in these two cases .",
    "one of the reasons is a fact that the urqmd model does not include effects of short - range correlations ( bose - einstein and coulomb ) .",
    "moreover , it has been already shown by the ceres experiment that the measured values of mean @xmath4 fluctuations , calculated by use of the urqmd model with default parameters , can be underestimated @xcite and that switching off secondary scattering ( in particular meson - baryon rescattering ) results in the values of @xmath4 fluctuations similar to those observed in the data .",
    "it has been also checked that this underestimation ( when rescattering processes are included in the urqmd model ) can be even stronger for lower energies .",
    "the above effect , observed by the ceres experiment , might help in a qualitative explanation of the underestimation of the urqmd @xmath0 values in fig .",
    "[ fipt_urqmd_onlyone ] .",
    "the similar structure of the energy dependence of the @xmath0 measure for the na49 data and for the urqmd model encourages us to search for an explanation of the origin of the increased @xmath0 values for positively charged particles at lower sps energies by analyzing effects incorporated in the model simulations .",
    "although the track - by - track identification is not always possible in the data it is instructive to check - by use of the urqmd model - what is the particle content in the studied forward - rapidity region . the na49 sample of negatively charged particles is composed mainly of negative pions ( 94.4% of all negatives for 20@xmath14 gev and 89.4% of all negatives for 158@xmath14 gev ) and negatively charged kaons ( 5.6% for 20@xmath14 gev and 9.2% for 158@xmath14 gev ) , whereas the number of antiprotons can be treated as negligible ( below 0.1% for 20@xmath14 gev and 1.6% for 158@xmath14 gev ) .",
    "the sample of positively charged particles is less homogeneous , as it contains positive pions ( 42.8% for 20@xmath14 gev and up to 69% for 158@xmath14 gev ) , positive kaons ( from 8.5% for 20@xmath14 gev to 10.4% for 158@xmath14 gev ) and protons ( 48.7% for 20@xmath14 gev and 20.6% for 158@xmath14 gev ) . within the na49 kinematic and acceptance region",
    "the total multiplicity of the final state protons remains nearly constant for all five energies ( 11.1 - 13.2 ) , in contrary to the multiplicities of newly produced ( generated ) particles such as @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , the fraction of protons in a sample of positively charged particles is significantly higher for lower energies and thus one can expect that the increased @xmath0 values for lower energies might be indeed due to protons . the qualitative verification of this hypothesis is presented in fig . [ fipt_urqmd_pi_p_k ] where the @xmath0 values are presented separately for different types of final state particles .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fipt_urqmd_pi_p_k ] shows that the @xmath0 values for protons only ( solid , thick curve ) are very close to those for all positively charged particles ( solid , thin curve ) thus confirming that protons indeed are responsible for the increased @xmath0 values at lower energies .",
    "the @xmath0 measure obtained for newly produced particles such as pions , kaons ( positively and negatively charged ) or antiprotons is consistent with zero for all energies ( in agreement with the hypothesis of weak interparticle correlations ) .",
    "although the precise track - by - track identification in the na49 experiment is much less reliable than the statistical one , the similar analysis with identified particles was prepared also for the na49 data . in order to identify particles",
    "the combined information on the ionization energy loss ( @xmath31 ) and total momentum ( bethe - bloch curves ) was used .",

    "the quantitative comparison of @xmath0 values - for positively charged particles and for protons only - is rather difficult because bethe - bloch identification leads to random losses of particles .",
    "the latter was found @xcite to reduce strongly the magnitude of correlations .",

    "additionally , the @xmath0 values have been evaluated for the so - called ` @xmath33 ' acceptance which means that only transverse momentum cut ( @xmath17 gev / c ) has been used in the analysis ( dotted lines in fig .",

    "it has been shown in @xcite that for lower sps energies the na49 acceptance for @xmath4 fluctuations analysis extends to the beam spectator domain .",
    "therefore a sample of particles used in the analysis can be contaminated by beam particles .",
    "thus one can speculate that the increase of @xmath0 values may be somehow attributed to the presence of beam protons .",
    "then , the measured correlation should be even stronger for the detector with complete ( ` @xmath33 ' ) acceptance because some of the beam particles - spectators or elastically rescattered protons - might hit into the midrapidity region or even into the backward hemisphere .",
    "moreover , also participating neutrons ( as neutral particles are not registered in the detector ) should increase the total @xmath0 value .",

    "within the na49 acceptance ( forward rapidity ) the possible contamination from beam particles is the highest for 20@xmath14 gev interactions and therefore a test was carried out to check how the @xmath0 measure behaves when beam particles region is rejected .",

    "the original magnitude of @xmath0 ( about 130 mev / c ) can be reproduced only when both spectators and `` not spectators '' are used in the analysis .",
    "it simply indicates that there should be some kind of correlation between spectators and `` not spectators '' .",
    "the same observation can be achieved for i d of parent process equal and not equal zero .",
    "the opposite situation takes place when protons originating from decays are considered .",
    "the @xmath0 value evaluated for protons coming from decays is rather low : however , if such protons are rejected from the analysis , - the @xmath0 does not decrease but even increases !",
    "it means that protons from decays ( i.e. newly produced particles ) do not generate the dominant correlation in the analysis .",
    "it is in agreement with intuitive predictions , because also newly produced particles such as pions , kaons , or antiprotons lead to @xmath0 value consistent with zero .",
    "finally , it has been observed that not only protons from decays but also protons created in a list of inelastic processes ( labeled as 1 , 14 , 15 , 27 , 30 ) result in a @xmath0 values consistent with zero .",
    "therefore it can be concluded that the whole effect of the increased transverse momentum fluctuations comes from beam / target particles only ( both real spectators and elastically scattered beam / target protons ) .",
    "those particles can hit different rapidity windows - depending on the centrality of a given event .",
    "consequently , the sample composed by a mixture of events with different impact parameters generates increased event - by - event @xmath4 fluctuations .",
    "the impact parameter range in the 7.2% most central pb+pb interactions is wide enough to produce significantly increased @xmath0 values .",
    "@xmath37 & @xmath38    . [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     & 2.7 @xmath40 1.1 & 14.0 & 4.3",
    "it has been presented how event - by - event impact parameter fluctuations influence transverse momentum fluctuations . in principle , it has been explained that the preliminary na49 results - showing significantly increased @xmath0 values at lower sps energies - are connected with the trivial effects of impact parameter fluctuations .",
    "it suggests that a precise selection of very narrow centrality bins should be crucial not only for the analysis of multiplicity fluctuations @xcite but also for transverse momentum fluctuations and probably for other kinematic characteristics .",
    "it was predicted that either approaching the phase boundary of the qcd phase diagram or hadronization close to the critical point should lead to increased values of transverse momentum fluctuations .",
    "therefore it is very important to distinguish between interesting physical effects and trivial ones as those connected with impact parameter fluctuations .",
    "below , one can find several methods to eliminate the effects of event - by - event impact parameter fluctuations .    1",
    ".   one can perform the analysis for all three charge selections ( all charged , negatively charged , positively charged ) and check whether the same structure ( not necessarily the magnitude ! ) of @xmath0 versus energy or centrality ( system size ) appears for all possible charge selections ( see the na49 results in @xcite ) .",
    "if the previous method is not possible it is safer to restrict the analysis to negatively charged particles only , instead of all charged or positively charged ones .",
    "3 .   the experiments with reliable particle identification can try to reject protons from the sample and measure @xmath0 for newly produced particles only ( pions or a mixture of pions , kaons , etc . ) .",
    "4 .   one can also probe the midrapidity region only ( production domain ) or at least one can check whether the selected acceptance does not extend to the beam / target spectator domain .",
    "the best and the least controversial method relies on a drastic centrality restriction",
    ". however , due to insufficient statistics , this method can not be applied by every experiment .",
    "it has been already mentioned that due to the specific choice of the rapidity region ( midrapidity only ) the rhic experiments are essentially free of the effects of impact parameter fluctuations , even though in most cases the results are obtained by use of all charged particles registered in the detectors .",
    "the same remark concerns also the ceres experiment at cern sps that measured transverse momentum fluctuations in 40@xmath14 , 80@xmath14 , and 158@xmath14 gev pb+au interactions by use of all charged particles - but produced in midrapidity region only @xcite . in contrary , the acceptance of the na49 experiment - selected for the analysis of transverse momentum fluctuations - extends to the beam spectator domain . however , the na49 experiment performs the analysis by use of all three charge selections and therefore it was possible to separate and finally eliminate the trivial effects connected with the impact parameter fluctuations .",
    "i am indebted to the authors of the urqmd model for the permission to use their code in my analysis .",
    "i am very grateful to marek gadzicki for his interesting comments and suggestions concerning this analysis .",
    "i also appreciate the editorial remarks from ewa skrzypczak and staszek mrwczyski .",
    "finally i thank jarek grebieszkow for the software support ."
