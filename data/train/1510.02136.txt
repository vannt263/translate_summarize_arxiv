    "beta - decay rates are an important ingredient in simulations of the astrophysical @xmath1-process . because parts of the @xmath1-process path are still not accessible to experiment , it is up to theoretical models to produce approximate rates for many relevant neutron - rich isotopes .",
    "models could also help resolve the issues raised by ref .",
    "@xcite , which argued that the flux of antineutrinos from nuclear reactors does not agree with the standard model . ref .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the discrepancy could be due to an overly simple treatment of first - forbidden beta decay in fission products .",
    "several schemes / methods for calculating beta - decay rates across almost the entire nuclear chart have been devised .",
    "they include the proton - neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation ( pnqrpa ) with a residual gamow - teller interaction @xcite , gross theory @xcite , semi - gross theory @xcite , the extended thomas - fermi plus strutinsky integral ( etfsi ) method @xcite , and artificial neural networks @xcite , and , very recently , the relativistic spherical pnqrpa @xcite .",
    "full beta - decay tables for neutron - rich isotopes have been only published by mller _",
    "et al _ @xcite and marketin _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "many other authors have applied more sophisticated and/or computationally intensive methods to smaller sets of nuclei , focusing on some of those important for the @xmath1 process .",
    "recent examples of such work include a deformed pnqrpa computation with the bonn - cd interaction of the decay of neutron - rich isotopes with @xmath2 @xcite , of isotopes of zr and mo @xcite , and of isotopes of kr and sr @xcite ; similar calculations with gogny interaction in the @xmath3 isotonic chains @xcite ; relativistic pnqrpa @xcite for @xmath4 ; and relativistic pnqrpa for @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "computational barriers have thus far prevented the production of a beta - decay table for the entire nuclear chart in a fully self - consistent skyrme mean - field approach that allows deformation .",
    "recently , however , we reported @xcite an implementation of the charge - changing finite amplitude method , which sidesteps the qrpa eigenvalue problem .",
    "we obtain beta - decay rates by directly computing the required sums and integrals over allowed final states of the response to charge - changing perturbations .",
    "we will soon make available a code called pnfam that implements the method",
    ".    we could proceed by choosing an existing density functional , interpreting it as a density - dependent effective interaction , and calculating beta - decay rates .",
    "if we were interested in , e.g. , the effects of tensor terms discussed in refs.@xcite and @xcite , we could take them from already - parametrized functionals .",
    "such a procedure would require some parameter fitting because pairing interactions and strengths , especially those associated with isoscalar pairing , are not usually specified alongside skyrme particle - hole effective interactions .",
    "but that approach is still too limiting because not all skyrme functionals can be consistently represented as effective interactions .",
    "in particular , the time - even and time - odd parts of the functional , which are related if the functional is the mean - field expectation value of a hamiltonian , need not be related in more general constructions .",
    "our main goal here is to assess the ability of the skyrme qrpa with deformation to predict @xmath6 decay , and to use existing data ( decay rates and resonance energies ) to constrain the isoscalar - pairing strength and the other time - odd coupling constants , which in the general energy - density functional ( edf ) picture , are not fixed by fits to masses , precisely because they are independent of the time - even functional .",
    "in much of what follows , therefore , we will not assume that the functional results from mean - field theory with an interaction and so will have to fit a significant number of parameters .",
    "after presenting our methods and assessment , we display the ( summarized ) results of a a full table of beta - minus rates , computed with the pnfam , for even - even nuclei in all medium - mass and heavy isotopic chains .",
    "we use a simple but apparently accurate model to quantify and extrapolate theoretical uncertainty .",
    "this article is organized as follows : section  [ sec : theory ] is a brief overview of the theoretical background , and section  [ sec : comp ] details our computational approach and parameter - fitting procedures . in section  [ sec : results ] , we assess the quality of our results , comparing them to earlier work and to experimental data where available .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] contains conclusions .",
    "the finite amplitude method ( fam ) , a formulation of the random - phase approximation that speeds the computation of nuclear response functions , was introduced in nuclear physics in ref .",
    "it was later generalized to the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) in ref .",
    "@xcite and to the relativistic qrpa in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we applied the method to charge - exchange transitions , in particular allowed and first - forbidden beta decay .",
    "the fam solves equations for the amplitude of the linear response to a small but finite perturbation . as a result",
    ", the method does not directly yield the poles and residues of the response , which are the central objects in the matrix version of the qrpa .",
    "but if the goal of the computation is to get transition strength functions in a large model space the fam can yield results in orders of magnitude less cpu time than matrix qrpa .",
    "the fam offers another advantage for beta decay : the weighted sums or integrals of transition strength can be expressed as contour integrals .",
    "this fact was first exploited by hinohara et al .",
    "@xcite , who evaluated the response at a relatively small number of complex frequencies to compute sum rules . in ref .",
    "@xcite we used the idea to evaluate the more complicated beta - decay phase - space - weighted integrals , which are not analytic and contain interference terms between first - forbidden operators . with the fam",
    "we can thus use typical supercomputer resources to calculate many observables in a large number of nuclei .",
    "we are able to extend systematic skyrme parameter fitting from mean - field calculations to deformed qrpa calculations , at least in a preliminary way .",
    "our starting point in the particle - hole channel is a generic skyrme edf : @xmath7 here @xmath8 contains products of time - even local densities only , with coefficients fixed by fitting to masses and perhaps a few other quantities , and @xmath9 is given by @xmath10{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{s}}}_{tt_3}^2 + c_t^{\\delta s}{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{s}}}_{tt_3 } \\cdot \\bm\\nabla^2 { \\ensuremath{\\mathbf{s}}}_{tt_3 } + c_t^{j } { \\ensuremath{\\mathbf{j}}}_{tt_3}^2 \\\\ & +   c_t^t { \\ensuremath{\\mathbf{s}}}_{tt_3 }",
    "\\cdot { \\ensuremath{\\mathbf{t}}}_{tt_3 } +   c_t^{s\\nabla j } { \\ensuremath{\\mathbf{s}}}_{tt_3 } \\cdot \\bm\\nabla \\times { \\ensuremath{\\mathbf{j}}}_{tt_3 } \\\\ & + c_t^f { \\ensuremath{\\mathbf{s}}}_{tt_3 } \\cdot { \\ensuremath{\\mathbf{f}}}_{tt_3 } +   c_t^{\\nabla s } \\left(\\bm\\nabla \\cdot { \\ensuremath{\\mathbf{s}}}_{tt_3}\\right)^2 \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the spin density @xmath11 , the current density @xmath12 , the spin - kinetic density @xmath13 , and the tensor - kinetic density @xmath14 defined e.g.  in ref .  @xcite .",
    "if one requires the functional to be the mean - field expectation value of a skyrme interaction , edf coupling constants are completely determined by the ( fewer ) parameters that specify the interaction , as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite and mentioned above . in this work",
    ", we adopt the view that the effective `` interaction '' comes from the energy - density functional rather than the other way around .",
    "consequently we are free to fit all the time - odd coupling constants without spoiling the mass fits generated the time - even couplings .",
    "we do , however , adopt the values obtained from the skyrme parametrization as our starting point for the fits , unless we note otherwise .",
    "the subset @xmath15 of time - odd coupling constants maps directly to the parameters of landau - migdal interaction for infinite homogeneous nuclear matter with tensor terms @xcite . in that sense , these couplings are intimately related to the bulk properties of the nuclear matter .",
    "the constant @xmath16 is purely tensor in character , and it determines the tensor term in the landau - migdal interaction . the spin - density coupling constant @xmath17 strongly affects the gamow - teller strength distribution and can be fit to the locations of gamow - teller resonances @xcite .",
    "the last term @xmath18 maps to a linear combination of the landau parameters of both the tensor term and a term that depends on the scattering angle of the laundau - migdal quasiparticles .",
    "two other parameters have a large effect in the qrpa : the strengths of the residual particle - particle ( or pairing ) interaction between protons and neutrons , @xmath19 where @xmath20  @xmath21 is the saturation density of nuclear matter and @xmath22 $ ] controls the pairing density - dependence ( throughout this work we use mixed pairing , i.e.  @xmath23 ) .",
    "the isovector ( @xmath24 ) proton - neutron pairing mainly affects fermi beta decay , which plays almost no role in heavy nuclei ; we simply set its strength @xmath25 to be the average of the neutron - neutron and proton - proton pairing strengths ( both fixed in the hfb part of the calculation ) .",
    "the isoscalar ( @xmath26 ) pairing is a different story ; it has a strong effect on gamow - teller decay , and determining a reasonable value for its strength is a common issue in single and double beta decay computations .",
    "the hfb mean field is independent of the @xmath26 pairing term as long as explicit proton - neutron mixing is neglected .",
    "we are thus free to fit @xmath27 in the qrpa .",
    "we include three types of observables in our fitting procedure : gamow - teller resonance energies , spin - dipole resonance energies , and total beta decay rates , all in both spherical and deformed isotopes .",
    "although we pick several sets of target nuclei for fitting the decay half - lives , each set includes a large range of mass values so that our fits can be global . to assess the success of the fits and to compare them to earlier work in very different models , we also compute the following metrics for beta - decay tables , as laid out e.g.  in @xcite : the residual of each computed @xmath28 value ( where @xmath29 is the half - life and the logarithm is 10-based ) , @xmath30 the average of the residuals , @xmath31 ( where we ve used an index @xmath32 to indicate that there is an @xmath1 for every nucleus ) and the standard deviation of the residuals around the average , @xmath33 ^ 2 } .\\ ] ] ref .",
    "@xcite contains an excellent compilation of these quantities .",
    "as theoretical approaches grow more sophisticated , the analysis of theoretical uncertainty is growing in importance . here",
    "we attempt to provide reasonable estimates for the uncertainty in our predicted half - lives , particularly in isotopes that are too short - lived to allow measurement .",
    "the standard prescription for assigning a theoretical ( statistical ) uncertainty @xmath34 to a computed observable @xmath35 is @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the covariance matrix @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the @xmath40 parameters of the model .",
    "the partial derivatives of all the observables @xmath41 with respect to all the parameters evaluated at the result of the fit @xmath42 form the jacobian @xmath43 : @xmath44 when not analytically accessible , the needed partial derivatives can be estimated through finite central differences .",
    "( in general , the theoretical uncertainty related to the jacobian must be supplemented by numerical and experimental uncertainties .",
    "we have assumed that the theoretical uncertainty is much larger than the other two , which we therefore neglect . )    to use eq .   to assign an uncertainty to every beta - decay rate in our table",
    ", we would need to evaluate the jacobian in eq .",
    "for ( the logarithms of ) all the half - lives @xmath29 in our table .",
    "unfortunately , the required @xmath45 full decay - table computations are still not possible in a reasonable amount of computer time , even with the efficiency of the fam .",
    "we therefore attempt to gauge the uncertainties and their @xmath0 dependence in a more nave way .",
    "we construct a simple few - parameter _ model for the uncertainties _ that we can then fit to the observed differences between our numerical results and known experimental values .",
    "the resulting approach is agnostic about how the decay is actually calculated ; it treats the nuclear model as a black box that produces predictions for @xmath0 values and beta - decay rates .",
    "it does , however , make several assumptions about both the calculated and experimental strength distributions that are only approximately correct .",
    "the first assumption is that the final states that contribute significantly to a decay rate lie not too far from the ground state in a relatively small window of excitation energy , so that we can reasonably approximate them , again either in our calculation or in the real world , by one effective state with an effective @xmath0 value @xmath46 ( that is not too different from the ground - state @xmath0 value ) : @xmath47 here @xmath48 is the standard integrated shape function for the transition to the final state @xmath49  for an allowed state decay this is simply the transition strength , and for a non - unique forbidden decay it encapsulates several terms  and @xmath50 is the usual allowed phase - space integral .",
    "the quantity @xmath51 is the @xmath0 value of the decay to the state @xmath49 divided by @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is the charge of the daughter nucleus .    with these definitions",
    ", we can proceed to define an effective shape factor @xmath54 as @xmath55 the @xmath48 depend on the @xmath51 for forbidden transitions , but the dependence is weak compared to that of the corresponding phase - space integral , and so we neglect it in our effective shape factor .",
    "all these definitions can be made independently for the experimental strength distribution and the theoretical one .",
    "the quantity we wish to understand is the ratio @xmath1 of the theoretical and experimental lifetimes : @xmath56 where the meanings of @xmath57 and @xmath58 and the corresponding quantities @xmath59 and @xmath60 should be clear .",
    "we omit the nucleus index @xmath32 in them for brevity .",
    "because the phase space grows quickly with decay energy , the effective @xmath0 values will usually be close to ground - state - to - ground - state @xmath0 value .",
    "we therefore expand both logarithms in eq .   of the phase - space factors about the theoretical ground - state - to - ground - state @xmath0 value @xmath61 to first order in @xmath62 :",
    "@xmath63 this approximation is best when the @xmath0 value is high , because the curvature of @xmath64 is small at high @xmath62 . for @xmath0 values",
    "lower than about 23  mev the first - order approximation is poor , so we exclude such data points from our analysis .    replacing the two logarithms in eq .",
    "by the first - order expressions , we find that several terms cancel in the difference , so that @xmath65",
    "we now make another set of assumptions , this time about the distribution of the errors in the theoretical values : first , we assume that the relative error in the effective shape factor is normally distributed with a slight systematic component . that is , we assume that for each nucleus , we have @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a constant , independent of the nucleus in which the decay occurs , that captures the systematic error and the set of all nucleus - dependent @xmath68 s is normally distributed with standard deviation @xmath69 , which is a measure of statistical error that is independent of decay energy .",
    "similarly , we assume that the errors in the theoretical effective @xmath0 value follow a normal distribution , so that @xmath70 where @xmath62 is now a nucleus - independent systematic error in the effective @xmath0 value and the set of @xmath71 s ( again , one for each nucleus ) is normally distributed around zero with the standard deviation @xmath72 that represents statistical error , again independent of @xmath0 .",
    "( both @xmath62 and @xmath71 are expressed in units of @xmath52 , and the factor @xmath73 is absorbed into @xmath62 and @xmath71 for convenience . ) finally , we assume that the errors @xmath71 and @xmath74 are independent .    with these assumptions , we then have @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a random error , the set of which must be normally distributed at each @xmath77 with width @xmath78 we can now use eqs .   and to determine the values of @xmath67 , @xmath62 , @xmath69 , and @xmath72 .",
    "we obtain the first two through a fit to eq .  , which expresses @xmath79 as a function of @xmath80 ( and thus of @xmath61 ) , with the set of ratios @xmath79 given by our calculations ( and experiment ) and @xmath81 set to zero . finally , we insert the fit values of @xmath67 and @xmath62 into the square of eq .",
    ", which then expresses @xmath82 as a function of @xmath83 , and determine the values of @xmath69 and @xmath72 by requiring that the line for @xmath84 as a function of @xmath83 that expresses eq .",
    "goes through the middle of the data , with as many points below @xmath85 as above it .",
    "a second least squares fit of @xmath69 and @xmath72 in the right hand side of eq . to the set of @xmath86 s accomplishes the task nicely .",
    "the explicitly @xmath0-dependent @xmath87 can then be extrapolated to large @xmath0 values where there are no data .    for both fits , in practice",
    ", we only include data points with @xmath88  mev and exclude any data points with @xmath89 as obvious outliers .",
    "we also adopt the primakoff - rosen approximation @xcite for the phase - space integral in the uncertainty model , making the expression @xmath80 a simple ratio of two polynomials , independent of @xmath53 : @xmath90 once the four parameters of the uncertainty model have been determined , the uncertainties of the theoretical predictions are obtained the inverse relation of @xmath91 with @xmath92",
    "values , with sko ( top ) and with sv - min ( bottom ) .",
    "the insets show the distribution of differences .",
    "the errors in our computed @xmath0 values follow a normal distribution with an average of @xmath93  mev and a standard deviation of @xmath94  mev , with no noticeable bias when moving to higher @xmath0 values . ]",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]         fig .",
    "[ fig : multipole - decomp ] also demonstrates the importance of going beyond the allowed approximation . in many heavy nuclei ,",
    "the computed rates are dominated by the first - forbidden channel . towards the drip line , both allowed and forbidden channels are important for all masses .",
    "the figure also shows that the non - unique @xmath95 channel is usually the most important of the forbidden multipoles .",
    "thus any quenching of the ( unique ) @xmath96 channel and anti - quenching of the ( non - unique ) @xmath97 channel from meson - exchange currents @xcite would not have a significant impact on our overall results . in the @xmath95 channel the contributions of several different operators makes the effects of quenching hard to estimate .    in figure",
    "[ fig : our_vs_moller ] we compare our half - lives to those of mller _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite in all medium and heavy even - even isotopes .",
    "our half - lives tend to be longer then those of ref .  @xcite close to the valley of stability in light nuclei and somewhat shorter in heavy nuclei ( with significant forbidden contributions ) .",
    "approaching the neutron drip line , the two computations yield similar results up to a constant offset in those of ref .",
    "@xcite in even - even nuclei .",
    "all models can expect to do better near the drip line , where a significant fraction of the total @xmath98-decay strength can be below threshold .    because our nave model for uncertainties is based on several assumptions that are only approximately correct or can not easily be verified",
    ", we check its predictions where there are enough data to do so .",
    "figure [ fig : bands ] shows the ratios of our half - lives to those of experiment together with the uncertainty model s mean value and one- and two - standard - deviation bands , all as a function of ground - state @xmath0 value .",
    "we can discount the model at very low @xmath0 but it appears to work well above @xmath99 mev . out of the 72 nuclei , 48 ( 66.7% ) fall within one standard deviation of the mean and 71 ( 98.6% ) within two .",
    "these numbers are consistent with what one would expect from a normal distribution .",
    "the model quantifies our statement above that calculations are more accurate close to the drip line , where @xmath0 is generally large .    a recent ribf measurement @xcite of 110 neutron - rich isotopes , 40 of them previously unknown , allows us to test the reliability of our predictions and especially our model for theoretical uncertainties .",
    "because the data are so recent , we did not include them in any of our fits , and hence we are effectively using older data to predict the results of these new measurements .",
    "we have @xmath100 even - even nuclei with which to compare rates ; for half of these there are earlier data in the ensdf set ( figure  [ fig : ribf ] ) .",
    "our predictions agree with experiment to within our theoretical uncertainty ( though our error bars may be a bit too large here ) .",
    "our uncertainty model thus appears to be reasonable .",
    "half - lives of neutron - rich even - even nuclei measured only recently @xcite and not included in the ensdf data set .",
    "all the measured half - lives fall within our one - sigma error bars , suggesting that our uncertainty estimates are too pessimistic in this particular region . ]",
    "we have explored the ability of the axially - deformed skyrme qrpa to provide a global description of beta - decay rates in even - even neutron - rich nuclei . with experimental rates and charge - exchange resonance energies as fitting targets",
    "we have found that among time - odd couplings , only those multiplying the isoscalar - pairing and the spin - density parts of the functional are well constrained ; attempts to fit more than these two constants lead to overfitting .",
    "the tensor contributions to the energy - density functional are , in particular , not well constrained by this data . to get more accurate skyrme - qrpa predictions",
    ", one can resort to local fits , i.e.  @xmath101-dependent couplings . the recent work of ref .",
    "@xcite , for example , attaches a sensible @xmath101 dependence to the strength of isoscalar pairing .",
