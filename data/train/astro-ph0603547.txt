    "the perseus molecular cloud is a prime example of a low - mass star forming region .",
    "low - mass protostars are found in a number of dense clusters , such as ngc  1333 and ic  348 , looser groups associated with smaller dark clouds , including barnard 1 , barnard 5 , l1448 and l1455 , and a number of dense cores .",

    "@xcite found that the yso candidates were distributed throughout the cloud with higher numbers toward the prominent clusters in ic  348 and ngc  1333 : 87% of the ysos were located within 1  degree of these two clusters , but only 30% within 30 .",
    "subsequent near - infrared studies have focused on the regions around ngc  1333 @xcite and ic  348 @xcite , identifying a large number of infrared excess sources ( about 60 sources in each region  corresponding to 50% and 20% of the total number of cluster members in ngc  1333 and ic  348 , respectively ) .",
    "the exact distance to perseus remains uncertain .",
    "it is not clear whether the cloud is located in the vicinity of the per ob2 association ( at a distance of 320  pc inferred from hipparcos parallax measurements @xcite ) or whether the cloud is closer , in front of the ob association at 200250  pc such as suggested by extinction studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . whether a single distance to the entire cloud is valid or whether the perseus cloud in fact has a distance gradient ( similar to an observed line of sight velocity gradient @xcite ) or is a conglomeration of smaller clouds is another issue . in any case",

    "thereafter extends further south with weaker emission .",
    "the break occurs at the exact position of the b1-d submillimeter core suggesting some interaction between the outflows and the core .",
    "an outflow extending from a source embedded in the b1-d core can of course also not be ruled out : no point source is seen in the irac bands but a faint mips source is seen toward the position of the submillimeter core . previously no outflow had been associated with the b1-b sources , but this may have been due to the confusion in the region .",
    "based on maps of the dust continuum emission from scuba and 3  mm interferometric measurements from the nobeyama millimeter array , b1-b was found to be a binary by @xcite with a separation of @xmath40  20@xmath41 , but it does not show up as two separate sources in the spitzer images .",
    "in addition to these sources the emission line star , lkh@xmath43327 , is clearly the strongest source in the irac bands located northwest of the submillimeter cores .",
    "lkh@xmath43327 is identified as a class ii object by our criteria .",
    "four additional candidate class i ysos are identified southwest of the main concentration of submillimeter cores .",
    "these sources are weak compared to the sources associated with the central cores , but might be associated with faint dust continuum emission .",
    "the region southwest of the main b1 core , the b1-ridge , is also interesting with two strong outflows associated with the two iras sources , iras  03282 + 3035 and iras  03292 + 3039 .",
    "both of these sources are associated with peaks in dust continuum emission in the maps of @xcite and @xcite , but neither is picked up in the high quality catalog above .",
    "a weak irac source is associated with iras  03282 + 3035 which is somewhat extended in a number of the irac bands . iras  03292 + 3039",
    "is not detected in irac band 1 by the source extraction algorithm but recognized as a faint ( 1.2  mjy ) source with an arcshaped nebulosity in the images .",
    "in addition to these two candidate deeply embedded protostars , two other iras sources , iras  03281 + 3039 and iras  03276 + 3042 are found in this region .",
    "the former was previously classified as a candidate galaxy based on its iras colors @xcite , but has colors consistent with a class i yso in our data .",
    "it is located in close proximity to a group of hh filaments , hh  770 , 771 and 772 @xcite and a group of sources classified as class ii objects in our analysis .",
    "it shows strong emission at all irac and mips wavelengths and is detected in 2mass , but is not associated with any dust continuum peaks .",
    "the latter , iras  03276 + 3042 , is likely associated with a candidate class ii source from our catalog also detected at all wavelengths .      as discussed above ,",
    "each of the known class 0 objects discussed above is driving outflows . table  [ embedlist ] lists the mid - infrared measurements of each of the class 0 objects , together with the candidate outflow driving sources discussed above .",
    "this compilation does not include sources in the areas covered by the guaranteed time observations of ngc  1333 and ic  348 discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the detection of mid - infrared counterparts for these deeply embedded protostars nicely demonstrates the high sensitivity of the spitzer observations , since previously only a few deeply embedded protostars had been measured in the mid - infrared .",
    "[ class0cc ] singles these objects out in the @xmath4-[4.5]$ ] vs. @xmath5-[8.0]$ ] diagrams and fig  [ class0sed ] shows the seds of each of them .",
    "each of these objects would easily be picked out as class i objects from this diagram with iras  03292 + 3039 at the bluest end of the distribution .",
    "these objects actually are somewhat separate from the overall population of class i objects with in general the reddest colors .",
    "it is clear from the diagram that the class 0 objects have much redder @xmath4-[4.5]$ ] colors than @xmath5-[8.0]$ ] colors . in the models of @xcite",
    "the explanation is that the 10  @xmath1 m silicate absorption feature overlaps with the irac4 ( 8.0  @xmath1 m ) band .",
    "objects with progressively more massive envelopes will have an increasing silicate absorption feature and therefore less red @xmath5-[8.0]$ ] colors , as the 8.0  @xmath1 m flux is absorbed .",
    "the objects in fig .",
    "[ class0cc ] fall outside the range spanned by the models of embedded ysos by @xcite with even redder @xmath4-[4.5]$ ] colors . judging from the diagrams of @xcite",
    "this could imply larger values of the centrifugal radius ( 300  au ) which would provide less line of sight absorption , similar to the modeling results of the class 0 protostar iras  16293 - 2422 @xcite .",
    "however , we emphasize that this is based on simple 1d models not taking the more detailed source structures into account .",
    "@xcite for example showed that the presence of outflow cavities likewise would lead to bluer colors - although this effect should be important for both [ 5.8]-[8.0 ] and [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] colors according to the models of @xcite .",
    "additional factors important for these colors could also be that the ( proto)stellar photosphere starts dominating at shorter wavelengths : this could cause a double peaked structure of the sed and can explain the seds that have a turnover between the irac2 and irac3 measurements ( fig",
    ".  [ class0sed ] ) .",
    "also the contribution from the shocked h@xmath2 emission to the 4.5  @xmath1 m band or deep absorption due to ice features included in the irac bands will affect the interpretation of these colors .",
    "combinations of all these effects could be the explanation for the scatter seen in the @xmath5-[8.0]$ ] colors of the class 0 objects in fig .",
    "[ class0cc ] .",
    "a more detailed dust radiative transfer treatment of the full sed from mid - infrared through ( sub)millimeter wavelengths for individual objects is needed to shed further light on these issues .",
    "the above discussion also illustrates that some of these potentially very interesting objects may not be singled out directly by the source extraction procedures due to confusion with nearby sources and extended h@xmath2 emission .",
    "of the 13 known protostars listed in table  [ embedlist ] only 5 ( l1448-c(s ) , l1455-irs1 , b1-b , b1-c and iras  03235 + 3004 ) are included in the high quality catalog ( sect .",
    "[ highqualitydef ] ) .",
    "it should also be emphasized that the above discussion is not a complete or an exhaustive discussion of all the information available about the outflows in the irac maps .",
    "for example , information about the shock structure could be obtained by comparing the ratios between the fluxes in different bands .",
    "this is outside the scope of this paper , however .",
