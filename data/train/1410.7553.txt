    "2009a , farnier et al .  2011 ) .",
    "a part of this gev emission shows evidence of modulation with the binary period ( farnier & walter  2011 , reitberger et al .",
    "therefore , it has to be produced not far from the binary system itself .",

    "this emission is transient and appears close to the quenched radio state just before the major radio flares observed from this system .",
    "the gev @xmath0-ray emission has not been identified up to now in the fermi - lat data from the binary system wr 20a within the open cluster westerlund 2 .",
    "two new sources reported by fermi collaboration in this direction have been identified with the @xmath0-ray pulsars ( abdo et al .",
    "2009b , saz parkinson et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "a few scenarios have been considered as possible explanations of the high energy emission from the open clusters .",
    "it has been proposed that strong winds produced by massive stars in open clusters are able to accelerate particles at shock waves formed during collisions of the winds with dense matter of the open cluster ( e.g. vlk & forman  1982 , cesarsky & montmerle  1983 , giovannelli et al .",
    "1996 , torres et al .",
    "2004 , bednarek 2007 ) .",
    "@xmath0-rays and neutrinos can be also produced by particles accelerated at the shocks formed within massive binary systems ( e.g. eichler & usov  1993 , white & chen  1995 , benaglia & romero 2003 , bednarek  2005a , reimer et al .",

    "massive stars within open clusters end their life at a relatively short time producing supernova remnants ( snrs ) and pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) .",
    "interaction of snrs shock waves with dense clouds within the open cluster can also accelerate relativistic particles that are able to produce high energy radiation ( aharonian & atoyan  1996 ) .",
    "a part of @xmath0-ray emission from the open clusters can be also produced within pwne or as a result of the interaction of particles accelerated within pwne with dense matter of an open cluster ( bednarek  2003 , bartko & bednarek  2008 , abramowski et al .",
    "2011 , ohm et al .",
    "2013 , aliu et al .",
    "it is not clear at present which of those scenarios provide a bulk of the high energy @xmath0-ray emission observed from a few open clusters mentioned above .",
    "it is likely that in specific open cluster a few processes can be important since different types of objects ( massive star winds , snrs , pwne ) might inject relativistic particles with comparable power , i.e. of the order of @xmath2 erg .    in the present paper we investigate in detail the high energy radiation expected in hadronic processes within and around the massive binary systems surrounded by the large concentration of matter .",
    "it is assumed that nuclei are accelerated in the region of colliding winds within the binary stars ( e.g. see bednarek  2005b ) .",
    "these nuclei can severely disintegrate , in the interaction with the radiation field of massive stars and with the matter of the stellar winds , injecting neutrons and protons . charged protons diffuse through the open cluster producing @xmath0-rays and neutrinos in collisions with the matter of the stellar wind cavity and dense environment of the open cluster . on the other hand , neutrons move balistically through the wind cavity and decay into protons at some distance from the binary system which can be still within the wind cavity or already within the open cluster .",
    "protons from their decay can also contribute to the high energy @xmath0-ray and neutrino spectrum .",
    "as an example , we perform calculations of the @xmath0-ray and neutrino fluxes produced in the clusters surrounding the eta carina supermassive binary system and wr 20a binary system in westerlund 2 open cluster .",
    "this emission is confronted with the present measurements of the gev - tev @xmath0-ray emission from these clusters , sensitivities of the future cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) and the icecube neutrino telescope .",
    "we consider a massive binary system in which one or both companion stars belongs to the class of the wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars .",
    "wr type star produces fast and dense wind , due to the huge mass loss rate , which can be of the order of @xmath3 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 .",
    "the winds propagate with the characteristic velocities of the order of @xmath6 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the density of the wind drops with the distance from the star according to , @xmath7 where @xmath8 cm is the radius of the star , and @xmath9 is the distance from the star in units of the stellar radius .",
    "note that at the distance of the order of a parsec , density of the wind becomes very low , e.g. for 1 pc the wind density becomes @xmath10 @xmath11 .",
    "so then , the outer regions of the wind cavity are filled with very rare but high velocity gas .",
    "we consider consequences of acceleration of nuclei within the binary system located in the open cluster .",
    "nuclei ( from the stellar winds ) can be accelerated within the collision region of the winds ( e.g. eichler & usov  1992 ) .",
    "the recconnection of the magnetic field and the diffusive shock acceleration process can play important role in this place .",
    "the details of the acceleration process , propagation of hadrons and their subsequent interaction within the binary system and its surrounding are discussed in the next section .",
    "we show that nuclei can efficiently disintegrate in the dense radiation and matter of the winds from massive stars . as a result",
    ", neutrons are injected .",
    "they decay at the distance from the binary system which is determined by their lorentz factors .",
    "protons , extracted from nuclei , lose energy on interaction with the dense wind close to the binary system .",
    "they also suffer adiabatic energy losses in the expanding wind within the wind cavity .",
    "we consider high energy processes in which @xmath0-rays and neutrinos are produced in hadronic collisions in the above described scenario .",
    "the schematic representation of the processes around the binary system is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "note that hadrons might be also accelerated in such scenario at the shock structure formed in the collision of the stellar wind with the circumstellar gas .",
    "we expect that this acceleration process is less efficient than the acceleration process occurring within the binary system .",
    "the product of the magnetic field strength and the characteristic dimension of the shock , determining the maximum energies of accelerated particles , is expected to be lower at the shock produced by the wind in surrounding gas due to the mainly radial of the magnetic field within the binary system and its toroidal structure far away from the binary .",
    "massive stars produce fast and dense winds which can extract significant amount of original mass from the star during its lifetime .",
    "in fact , the intensive mass loss rates of the order of a few @xmath21 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 are characteristic for the wolf - rayet ( wr ) and o type stars . during the main sequence stage ,",
    "the outer parts of stars are completely lost and only inner parts , composed of heavy nuclei , are left .",
    "therefore , the winds of early type stars are expected to be mainly composed from nuclei heavier than hydrogen such as helium to oxygen .",
    "massive stars are frequently found within the massive binary systems in which strong winds collide providing conditions for acceleration of nuclei to large energies .",
    "below , we generally consider the process of acceleration of nuclei at the shocks or the reconnection regions created by these colliding winds .",
    "the propagation and interaction of nuclei with the stellar radiation field results in their photo - disintegration to neutrons , protons and secondary nuclei .",
    "we perform numerical simulations of nuclei in the radiation field of the massive stars in order to determine the rate of injection of different nuclei . note that density of stellar photons in the vicinity of massive star , @xmath22 ph .",
    "@xmath11 ( where @xmath23 k is the surface temperature of the massive star ) , is a few orders of magnitude larger than density of matter in the stellar wind ( see eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] ) . therefore",
    ", it is expected that nuclei with sufficiently large energies interact at first in collisions with stellar photons rather than with the matter of the stellar wind .",
    "after that , nuclei can suffer significant fragmentation in collisions with the matter of the stellar wind .",
    "this second process is independent on energy of nuclei .",
    "therefore , lower energy nuclei can also suffer strong disintegration process in collisions with dense matter of the stellar winds in the case of stars with exceptionally strong winds such as considered in this paper ( i.e. wr and o type stars which mass loss rate is above @xmath24 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 ) .",
    "neutrons released from nuclei in collisions with the matter have the spectrum similar to the spectrum of primary nuclei .",
    "therefore , neutrons with low energies can decay relatively close to the binary system where the density of matter is still high . on the other hand",
    ", high energy neutrons can even reach dense regions outside the wind cavity of the massive binary system . in this paper",
    "we calculate @xmath0-ray and neutrino spectra produced by protons extracted from nuclei and also from protons from neutrons decaying at some distance from the binary system .",
    "these neutrons decay within the wind cavity and also within the dense open cluster in which binary system is immersed .",
    "we estimate the maximum energies of hadrons accelerated in the shock region of colliding winds following the conditions considered e.g. in bednarek & pabich  ( 2011 ) and bednarek  ( 2005b ) .",
    "the maximum energies of hadrons are determined by comparing their acceleration time scale and their escape time scale from the acceleration region or collision time scale with the matter of the stellar wind .",

    "we neglect possible direct production of neutral high energy radiation in the interaction of hadrons with the stellar radiation ( @xmath86 ) since , as we have shown above , nuclei are not accelerated to large enough energies to reach the threshold for this process in the environment of the binary systems .    in order to have an impression about the role of the fragmentation process of nuclei in the radiation field of massive stars we consider a simple case of their injection from a point - like source not far from the stellar surface , e.g. at the distance of two stellar radii .",
    "we calculate the optical depths for fragmentation of nuclei injected at different initial directions , as a function of their energy and two mass numbers corresponding to the helium and the oxygen nuclei ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "the approximation of the cross section for photo - disintegration process of nuclei is applied as described in karakua & tkaczyk  ( 1993 ) .",

    "these neutrinos will be also difficult to observe with the icecube telescope since their fluxes , produced in the wind cavity regions , are comparable to the atmospheric neutrino background .",
    "they are clearly below this background in the case of neutrinos produced in the open cluster itself .",
    "in fact many massive binary systems can be present at the same time in a specific open cluster .",
