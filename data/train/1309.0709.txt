    "a freely evolving gas of inelastically colliding particles behaves differently from a regular gas due to the dissipative nature of collisions . starting with a uniformly distributed granular gas ,",
    "the system first enters a homogeneous cooling state , where the kinetic energy decays as @xmath0 , known as haff s law @xcite .",
    "however , this regime is unstable against spatial fluctuations of collision frequency , leading to a crossover to a regime where the energy decreases as @xmath1 in _ d _ dimensions and eventually dense clusters appear @xcite . in order to maintain the dynamics , energy must be pumped into the system from an external driving source e.g.  by shaking , vibrating , or shearing . as a result ,",
    "the energy input competes against the energy dissipation due to inelastic collisions , and the system is driven into a steady state . since the energy insertion is spatially inhomogeneous in the above mentioned _ boundary heating _ methods , a _ uniformly heating _ approach had been proposed as a paradigm allowing to study a homogeneous stationary state @xcite ; the system is supposed to be in contact with a thermal bath which supplies energy by means of instantaneous random forces acting on all particles .",
    "the resulting dynamics , in two dimensions , is reminiscent of the motion of thin disks on an air table in quasi-2d experiments @xcite .",
    "the uniformly driven granular fluid reaches a _",
    "steady state due to the random nature of energy gain and loss , and exhibits _ long - range _ hydrodynamic correlations .",
    "these spatial correlations decay with distance as @xmath2 and @xmath3 in three and two dimensions , respectively @xcite .",
    "similar long - range spatial correlations emerge in freely cooling @xcite or sheared @xcite systems of slightly inelastic granular fluids , even though the anisotropic couplings between the number density and momentum density fluctuations influences the behavior in the sheared case , leading to a different power - law asymptotic form at large @xmath4 @xcite .    in a thermally fluctuating medium with long - range spatial correlations ,",
    "one expects that the presence of big intruder particles modifies the boundary conditions and , hence , leads to the modification of the hydrodynamic fluctuations spectrum . as a result ,",
    "effective interactions between intruders appear which are long - range , in spite of the short - range nature of hard - core interparticle forces .",
    "such interactions are often considered as classical variants of the casimir force @xcite .",
    "recent experiments @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite confirm that the confinement of fluctuations in fluidized granular media produces spatial hydrodynamic inhomogeneities that are practically strong enough to induce substantial effective interactions between the intruders .",
    "depending on the choice of parameter values , these forces can be either attractive or repulsive and may lead to a variety of collective behaviors @xcite . even a single asymmetric object may experience a self - force in a nonequilibrium state @xcite .",
    "the interactions emerging in equilibrium state had also been studied by considering two bodies immersed in a solution of macromolecules @xcite .",
    "note that we deal with the regime where the interparticle forces are mainly binary collisions .",
    "investigation of the underlying mechanisms when durable frictional contacts dominate the behavior is beyond the scope of the present study .    in this paper",
    "we first recall how the fluctuations of the hydrodynamic fields are spatially correlated in a randomly driven granular fluid .",
    "we derive the explicit form of the static structure factors , which reflect the spatial correlations of the medium .",
    "these quantities are then used to calculate the effective long - range interaction between two immobile big particles immersed in the medium .",
    "the method had been used in ref.@xcite to study the sign change and nonadditivity of the effective force , and to obtain the phase diagram of the transition between repulsive and attractive forces . here , the main goal is to provide a detailed methodology for obtaining the structure factors and the fluctuation - induced force , as a recipe for further applications and extensions .",
    "we also investigate the effect of small changes in the boundary conditions on the effective force , by considering elongated intruders and changing their shape or orientation .",
    "the elongated particles are frequent and play important role in nature and industry",
    ". the interesting question arises whether fluctuation - induced forces may lead to orientational ordering and alignment of such particles .",

    "let us first fix the orientation of the ellipses at @xmath150 and the distance between their centers at @xmath147 .",
    "we modify the shape of intruders by changing the ratio between the ellipse radii , @xmath151 , while its area is constant , i.e.  @xmath152 .",
    "the deviation of the shape from being circular can be characterized with the eccentricity parameter defined as @xmath153 using the same procedure as in sec .",
    "[ effectiveforce - section ] we calculate the effective force between two ellipses as @xmath154 . figure [ fig5 ] shows that the force considerably increases as the shape further deviates from being circular .",
    "the behavior of @xmath104 results from two competing effects : first , increasing @xmath155 causes lower pressure difference because @xmath156 decreases on average ; second , it also increases the integration interval @xmath157 $ ] , which increases the force .",
    "the latter effect seems to be more important so that the force monotonically increases with @xmath155 .",
    "next we investigate the influence of the orientations of the ellipses on the fluctuation - induced force .",
    "one expects that the eccentricity of the elliptical intruders also influences the force behavior when the orientation changes . only in the limit of circular shapes the orientation plays no role anymore .",
    "therefore , we fix the shape by choosing @xmath158 and vary the angles @xmath159 and @xmath149 .",
    "let us first consider two cases @xmath160 and @xmath161 for simplicity , thus , there remains only one rotational degree of freedom .",
    "the force is given by @xmath162 where the interval [ @xmath163 is the range of @xmath97 coordinate covered by both intruders . in the case of @xmath164 , each intruder covers a different range of @xmath97 coordinate , leading to a different value of @xmath165 .",
    "thus , in general , we choose the smaller value of @xmath165 to calculate the integral , i.e.  only the area where two elliptical intruders face each other is taken into account @xmath166 with increasing the angle @xmath159 , on the one hand the average ratio @xmath156 decreases which weakens the pressure difference between the gap and outside regions .",
    "on the other hand , the integration interval @xmath167 $ ] is extended which increases the force .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows that the intruders exert stronger forces on each other in the case @xmath168 ( maximum area , minimum @xmath169 ) compared with @xmath170 ( minimum area , maximum @xmath169 ) .",
    "one can also see that the interaction in the case of @xmath171 is slightly stronger than the case @xmath172 ( except at @xmath173 ) .",
    "the results of the general case of @xmath174 are shown in fig .",
    "the configuration with @xmath175 produces the strongest interaction , while the lowest force is obtained if @xmath176 and @xmath177 ( or @xmath178 .",
    "therefore , the maximum fluctuation - induced force is obtained when the two ellipses are aligned along the @xmath97 axis .",
    "this result , however , can not be trivially extended to more complicated situations , and a comprehensive study is required to elucidate the role of key parameters such as gas density and restitution coefficient , as well as the number , position , and orientation of the intruders in a multi - body configuration .",
    "we reviewed the detailed calculations of the mode coupling method to describe the nonequilibrium steady state of a randomly driven granular system .",
    "when the existence of arising long - range hydrodynamic correlations ( reflected in the structure factors ) is accompanied by geometric constraints , effective long - range forces appear . using the pair correlation functions in the mode coupling calculations",
    "leads to a reasonable estimation of the force between two intruders .",
    "it is notable that the hydrodynamic correlations become stronger in multi - intruder configurations or binary mixtures , which necessitates the usage of triplet or higher order structure factors @xcite .",
    "the validity of the hydrodynamic description is also limited to large restitution coefficients .",
    "the steady state of an inelastic granular fluid is inhomogeneous , resulting in a length scale @xmath179 on which the macroscopic hydrodynamic fields vary . decreasing",
    "the restitution coefficient would increase the gradient of the inhomogeneities , i.e.  decreases the length scale @xmath179 .",
    "the hydrodynamic description of the system holds only when @xmath179 is well separated from the mean - free path @xmath83 of the granular gas , and this happens only for large restitution coefficients .",
    "another point is that the analytical results presented in this work are restricted to two dimensions but the procedure can be extended to three dimensions e.g.  by considering a suitable equation of state for hard sphere systems , and calculating the force exerted on the surface of three - dimensional obstacles .",
    "nevertheless , the behavior of pressure fluctuations is different in two and three dimensions ( it behaves as @xmath180 in 3d while diverges logarithmically as @xmath181 in 2d ) .",
    "thus , the force is independent of ( logarithmically dependent on ) the system size in three ( two ) dimensions @xcite .",
    "indeed , the long - range behavior of the correlations and the dimensional dependence of the effective force originate from the behavior of the inverse of the laplacian in the hydrodynamic equations @xcite .",
    "finally , we have shown that changing the shape or orientation of the intruders influences the effective force in two different ways : ( i ) by modifying the gap length ( along the @xmath98-direction ) , which affects the pressure difference around the intruders , ( ii ) by modifying the gap width ( along the @xmath97-direction ) which changes the force integration interval .",
    "the spatial correlations decay rather slowly , meaning that tiny changes in the boundary conditions can not dramatically influence the pressure difference and , thus , the force .",
    "still , there might be a visible impact on the effective force , since varying the particle elongation in the @xmath97-direction strongly changes the area on which the force is applied .",
