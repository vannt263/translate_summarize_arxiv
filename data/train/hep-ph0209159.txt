    ". a possible source of confusion is that in b - physics the word `` factorization '' is also used to refer to the process of approximating the matrix element of a four quark operator by the product of two non - interacting bilinear currents ( the latter definition is often used even in cases where this is not a justified procedure ) . to distinguish the two meanings i will refer to the latter as `` 4q - factorization '' .",
    "the idea behind scet is to provide a systematic framework for studying inclusive and exclusive processes with energetic particles .",
    "this includes the investigation of power corrections and parameterization of non - perturbative effects by matrix elements of operators . to review the status of scet i have broken the discussion into several categories : fields and power counting , gauge symmetries , spin symmetries , reparameterization invariance , sudakov logarithms , and factorization . as an application i discuss the proof of factorization for @xmath8 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and similar decays in the large energy limit @xmath22 . in this case",
    "the separation of short and long distance scales leads to a type of 4q - factorization which has well defined scheme and scale dependence .",
