    "the upward - pointing arrow in each panel indicates the clump size which is derived from skid , namely @xmath48 .",

    "it is remarkable that some clumps do not have dark matter halos at @xmath5 ( see the first quadrant in the middle row of figure [ fig : skid ] ) .      in order to trace the evolution of clumps , we construct evolution histories of clumps .",
    "time evolution of each clump is tracked in the following way : at first , we prepare two clump catalogs ( catalog @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) at two adjacent time snapshots . if a clump in @xmath54 has more than a half of particles in a clump in @xmath55 , it is regarded as the progenitor of the clump in catalog @xmath55 .",
    "we trace clumps in our result back to @xmath56 , using 235 snapshots ( time interval of @xmath57 yr ) , and we obtain the evolutional tracks of all clumps found at @xmath1 .",
    "figure [ fig : xyzevolution ] shows the trajectories of a clump on @xmath58 and @xmath59 planes .",
    "this is a typical case of a clump being captured by the host halo .",
    "figure [ fig : rhevolution ] shows the distance from the center of mass of the clump to the galactic center @xmath60 ( solid line ) and the virial radius of the host halo @xmath61 ( dashed line ) against time and redshift .",
    "the clump gets into the virial radius of the host galaxy at @xmath62 .",
    "the pericenter - to - apocenter ratio of the elliptical orbit is @xmath63 , which is consistent to the mean value of observed galactic globular clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", we refer to this clump as the reference case .",
    "since clumps in the galactic halo are subjected to a tidal force of the host galaxy , their sizes , @xmath48 , should correlate with a tidal radius which is determined by the tidal force .",
    "assuming isotherm density profiles [ @xmath65 for the host halo and clumps , the tidal radius for a clump at @xmath60 is defined by @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the total mass of the clump and the total mass of the host galaxy within @xmath60 , respectively @xcite .",
    "this equation is derived from the balance between the tidal force due to the host halo and the self - gravity of the clump .",
    "evolution of @xmath48 , @xmath69 of the reference clump , and @xmath60 is shown in figure [ fig : rrrlevolution ] .",
    "the clump is captured by the host galactic halo at @xmath62 .",
    "the size of the clump is independent of the tidal radius before @xmath62 .",
    "however , it follows @xmath69 after @xmath62 .",
    "this suggests that once a clump is captured by the host halo , its radius instantaneously shrinks to the tidal radius .    in figure",
    "[ fig : rhlf ] we display the half mass radii for total ( @xmath70 ) , baryon ( @xmath71 ) , and dark matter ( @xmath72 ) components as representative sizes of the distributions of matters within the clump . from the plot",
    ", we find that ( 1 ) @xmath71 is always smaller than @xmath72 , and ( 2 ) @xmath70 comes close to @xmath71 with time while @xmath70 is almost similar to @xmath72 before the first pericenter passage ( @xmath73 ) . due to the radiative cooling , the gas shrinks towards the center of the clump immediately and",
    "forms a core in there .",
    "this is the reason of the first point . the second point , namely @xmath70 shifts from @xmath72 to @xmath71 ,",
    "is explained as the effect of the tidal stripping .    in figure",
    "[ fig : tidal ] we plot @xmath69 of clumps in the galactic halo against @xmath48 at @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "if the radii of clumps are determined by the tidal field , we should find a correlation ( solid line ) in figure [ fig : tidal ] .",
    "these figures clearly indicate that the sizes of clumps are determined by the local tidal field instantaneously , as we have already shown in figure [ fig : rrrlevolution ] , in spite of the tidal stripping being more efficient at the pericenter .",
    "this is because the matters off from clumps spill their local tidal radii after passing away from the pericenter . indeed , some of the clumps show clear evidence of elongation as the tidal tails ( see the distribution of old stars in model a in figure [ fig : snapshot ] )      since the baryons have more concentrated distribution than the dark matter within a clump , tidal stripping should affect them differently .",
    "we will show this effect more quantitatively below .",
    "figure [ fig : massmbmtevolution ] displays the mass evolution of three components ( gas , star and the dark matter ) of the reference clump . the mass of dark matter decreases with time .",
    "mass loss occurs mainly at each pericenter passage once a clump is captured .",
    "the rapid mass loss , for example at around @xmath76 gyr ( @xmath77 ) , corresponds to the time when the clump is passing the pericenter .",
    "the gas / stellar mass decreases / increases steadily owing to the star formation .",
    "however , the total mass of baryons ( gas + star ) is almost constant .",
    "this is because that the baryonic component tends to reside inside the tidal radius of the clump and is therefore less vulnerable to tidal stripping .",
    "eventually , the total mass of the clump becomes one - tenth of its original mass .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : massmbmtevolution ] , the baryon mass to total mass ratio in the reference clump increases with time , up to 0.5 .",
    "the baryon mass fractions in clumps in the galactic halo are plotted against @xmath60 in figure [ fig : mbmt ] ( a ) for a snapshot at @xmath5 .",
    "many clumps show signs of tidal stripping ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "since tidal force from the host galaxy is effective for clumps with smaller @xmath60 , @xmath79 should be larger for smaller @xmath60 .",
    "however , there is no clear trend between @xmath60 and @xmath79 in figure [ fig : mbmt ] ( a ) .",
    "suppose that the tidal stripping is the most effectively occurs following each pericenter passage , we expect that @xmath79 is proportional to the inverse of @xmath80 .",
    "in fact , figure [ fig : mbmt ] ( b ) shows this trend .",
    ", instead of @xmath80 , if a clump is in the first falling phase . ]",
    "note also that no clump is found within @xmath81 kpc , since the dynamical friction time scales of clumps within 1 kpc ( @xmath82 yr ) are smaller than the age of the system ( @xmath83 yr ) and clumps with small pericenters ( @xmath84 kpc ) fall into the galactic center and are tidally destroyed / disappeared .    another possible effect to determine @xmath79 is the eccentricity of each clump s orbit .",
    "even if @xmath80 is the same , clumps with high eccentricities spend most of their time at apocenter ( @xmath85 ) , as a result they are less severely stripped than those with smaller eccentricities . in figure",
    "[ fig : rperirapombmt ] , we plot @xmath79 as a function of @xmath86 at @xmath5 .",
    "as expected , there is a weak positive correlation between @xmath79 and @xmath86 .",
    "in addition to that , the plot also suggests that the baryon fraction is determined by ( 1 ) how many times the clumps pass the peri - center , represented by the numbers , and ( 2 ) @xmath80 , represented by the color sequences .",
    "figure [ fig : normalizedmbmt ] shows distribution of @xmath79 in clumps at @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the vertical axis shows the number of clumps in each bin ( 0.1 ) normalized by the total number of clumps at each epoch .",
    "the total number of clumps is shown in table [ tab : numbermass ] .",
    "the fractions of baryon dominated systems ( @xmath87 ) increases with time as 30 % ( @xmath45 ) , 32 % ( @xmath46 ) , and 60 % ( z = 2.0 ) .",
    "this is a natural consequence of the effective stripping of the dark matter halos from clumps by the tidal interaction with the host galaxy ( see figure [ fig : massmbmtevolution ] ) .",
    "in order to study the co - evolution of galaxy and its substructure such as gc , we run high - resolution @xmath7-body / sph simulations of galaxy formation . the numerical resolution of our simulation is high enough ( @xmath88 pc and @xmath12 ) to resolve the jeans instability of small clumps whose mass is larger than @xmath89 . with this high resolution , radiative cooling below @xmath90 k",
    "can be taken into account and this low temperature cooling strongly affects evolution of these systems .",
    "what we found on the evolution of clumps is summarized below :    * gravitationally - bound , small clumps with core - halo structure are first formed from cdm perturbations .",
    "after captured by the galactic halo , these clumps lose their dark matter halo due to the tidal field of the host galaxy , and result in baryon - dominated objects , such as gcs .",
    "by @xmath1 , almost half of the clumps ( 57 % ) becomes baryon - dominated systems ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "* the simulation without radiative cooling below @xmath25 k ( the model b ) shows an order of magnitude fewer clumps .",
    "this result implies that treatment of the low temperature cooling as well as heating is extremely important to investigate the formation of low mass objects , such as gcs .",
    "clumps studied here have a mass range similar to that of globular clusters ( gcs ) or dwarf galaxies .",
    "two formation scenarios for gc formation has been proposed in literature .",
    "one is that gcs are formed in dm minihalos before they infall into galactic halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the other is that gcs are formed from baryonic processes , such as hydrodynamical shocks , and thermal instability , in galactic halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "clumps around a host galaxy in our simulation ( see the last panel of figure [ fig : snapshot ] ) originate in hierarchically formed dm minihalos , and therefore our numerical results support the former scenario .",
    "the absence of dm halos around observed gcs @xcite could be the result of tidal stripping by interactions with the host galaxy .",
    "@xcite studied the tidal evolution of primordial gcs with dark matter halos in a static potential of a host galaxy . in their work ,",
    "_ dark matter - less _ gcs form from proto - gcs with dark matter halos via tidal stripping .",
    "our results also suggest that gcs can be formed naturally in the context of the cold dark matter universe .    in taking some heating mechanisms such as sn explosions and/or ultraviolet background heating and/or reionization ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "<S> tidal disruption of dark matter halos around proto - globular clusters in a halo of a small galaxy is studied in the context of the hierarchical clustering scenario by using semi - cosmological n - body / sph simulations assuming the standard cold dark matter model ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis on formation and evolution of the galaxy and its substructures archives until @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> in such a high - redshift universe , the einstein - de sitter universe is still a good approximation for a recently favored @xmath2-dominated universe , and then our results does not depend on the choice of cosmology . in order to resolve small gravitationally - bound clumps around galaxies and consider radiative cooling below @xmath3 , we adopt a fine mass resolution ( @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> because of the cooling , each clump immediately forms a ` core - halo ' structure which consists of a baryonic core and a dark matter halo . </S>",
    "<S> the tidal force from the host galaxy mainly strips the dark matter halo from clumps and , as a result , theses clumps get dominated by baryons . once a clump is captured by the host halo , its mass drastically decreases each pericenter passage . at @xmath5 , </S>",
    "<S> more than half of the clumps become baryon dominated systems ( baryon mass / total mass @xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our results support the tidal evolution scenario of the formation of globular clusters and baryon dominated dwarf galaxies in the context of the cold dark matter universe . </S>"
