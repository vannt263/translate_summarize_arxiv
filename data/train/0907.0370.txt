    "the 17 m diameter magic telescope on the canary island of la palma is the world s largest single imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope .",
    "one of the aims of the magic collaboration is to carry out observations at large zenith angles . under these special conditions and with a good telescope sensitivity a bigger effective area",
    "is given and sources from a large section of the southern sky can be observed with a threshold of a few hundred gev ( @xmath2100gev-500gev , zenith angle dependent ) .    here",
    "we present the results of an analysis of the crab nebula data set taken under large zenith angles ( 60@xmath3 to 66@xmath3 ) .",
    "in addition to the usual image parameters @xcite timing information of the recorded signals was used for reconstruction of the shower origin and for the background suppression .",
    "furthermore we present a reanalysis of a data set recorded at a zenith angle range between 59@xmath3 and 64@xmath3 . the same analysis and cuts are used as for the crab nebula data set .",
    "all the data analysed in this work was taken in wobble mode , i.e. tracking a sky direction , which is 0.4@xmath3 off the source position .",
    "the background is estimated from the same field - of - view , which improves the background estimation and yields a better time coverage because no extra off data have to be taken .",
    "compared to the previous analysis @xcite improvements are obtained because of an updated monte carlo ( mc ) sample at high zenith angles leading to a better agreement . a further improvement is achieved in the image cleaning and in the gamma / hadron separation thanks to the usage of the timing information of the images .    in the new analysis",
    "we use the time image cleaning @xcite : with a sub - nsec timing resolution of the data acquisition system and thanks to the parabolic structure of the telescope mirror a smaller integration window can be chosen .",
    "this reduces the number of pixels with signals due to night sky background , which survive the image cleaning .",
    "this allows reducing the pixel threshold level ( i.e. recorded charge ) of the image cleaning leading to a lower analysis energy threshold .    for the analysis a robust set of dynamical cuts with a small number of free parameters",
    "is used @xcite .",
    "in addition , cuts in time parameters are applied , which describe the time evolution along the major image axis and the rms of the time spread .",
    "these two additional parameters lead to a better background suppression yielding a better sensitivity of the analysis .",
    "the energy estimation is done with the random forest regression method @xcite .",
    "the crab nebula is one of the best studied celestial objects because of the strong persistent emission of the nebula over 21 decades of frequencies .",
    "it was the first object that was detected at tev energies by the whipple collaboration @xcite in the year 1989 and is the strongest steady source of vhe @xmath1-rays . due to the stability and the strength of the @xmath1-ray emission the crab nebula",
    "is generally considered the standard candle of the tev astronomy .",
    "the measured @xmath1-ray spectrum extends from 60gev @xcite up to 80tev @xcite and appears to be constant over the years ( from 1990 to present ) .      in october 2007 ,",
    "the magic telescope took data of the crab nebula with a zenith angle range of 60@xmath3 up to 66@xmath3 .",
    "the data was taken under dark sky conditions and in wobble mode .",
    "after quality cuts an effective on - time of 2.15hrs is obtained . using detection cuts ( i.e. optimized on significance of a different crab nebula sample ) ,",
    "a total of 247 excess events above 187 background events with a scale factor of 0.33 have been detected ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : crab_theta ] ) . according to li&ma formula 17 @xcite",
    "the significance of this signal is 12.8@xmath4 .",
    "this corresponds to an analysis sensitivity of 8.7 @xmath5 . using the same set of cuts we obtain the following sensitivities for integral fluxes ( @xmath6 ) : @xmath7    the on - source and normalized background distribution of @xmath8 .",
    "the on - source is shown in the black crosses and the background is shown in the gray shaded region .",
