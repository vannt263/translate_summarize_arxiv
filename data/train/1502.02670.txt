    "the lack of consensus on gc formation may indicate multiple formation mechanisms .",
    "in fact , the oldest gcs have essentially uniform ages centered at @xmath15 gyr and spread @xmath16 ( comparable to relative age uncertainty ) , but wide range of metallicities : from 1% to @xmath17 the solar value with high metallicity systems preferentially at small galactocentric radii .",
    "in contrast , younger systems show a well defined age - metallicity anti - correlation and higher metallicity at larger galactocentric radii @xcite .    in this _ letter _",
    "we aim at predicting the probability distribution function of ages for the sub - population of `` old '' gcs starting from dm halo assembly and merging , which are fully determined ( in the statistical sense ) by fixing the @xmath4 parameters .",
    "our approach parallels studies of evolution of galaxy properties with redshift , such as luminosity / stellar mass functions and clustering , all linked to halo assembly @xcite .",
    "we propose that old gcs formed via major merging of dm minihalos ( @xmath18 ) that are gas rich ( no previous star formation ) and metal - enriched through outflows originating from nearby ( proto)galaxies .",
    "first generation stars form during the merger - triggered burst , while subsequent gas infall through minor mergers can lead to multiple populations .",
    "since the halo merger rate is approximately constant per unit redshift ( both for major and minor events ; @xcite ) , there is only a short window of opportunity for this mechanism .",

    "we propose that old gcs form when a host galaxy like the mw is in the earliest stages of its assembly and lacks a well defined disk structure .",
    "its lagrangian region is still a moderate linear overdensity at @xmath24 containing hundreds of minihalos that are being hierarchically assembled , form stars , pollute their neighbours with metals , and merge to build up a massive system by @xmath22 ( figure  [ fig : mwinfancy ] ) .",
    "we assume that compact star clusters form during major mergers of two gas - rich and star - poor minihalos , whose gas has been previously enriched by outflows from nearby halos to @xmath25 .",
    "the combined minihalo mass needs to exceed the threshold for @xmath26 cooling ( @xmath27 ) , but if either of the progenitors was above the cooling mass threshold , it must not have started forming stars yet . under these conditions , the merger will shock - heat and concentrate the gas , leading to efficient formation of a star cluster . following the merger - triggered starburst ,",
    "type ii supernovae clear the gas remaining in the minihalo ( escape velocity is a few tens km / s ) , suppressing further star formation after @xmath28 .",
    "subsequently , slow winds from agb stars produce chemically enriched gas @xcite , which is retained in the potential well , and diluted by infall of new pristine gas through minor mergers and/or accretion .",
    "this gas loading triggers one or more bursts of star formation , more centrally concentrated than the first generation , with merger mass ratios and timing after agb pollution imprinting diverse chemical signatures in individual clusters , consistent with observations @xcite .",
    "the gc minihalo is eventually incorporated into the merger - tree main branch , with continued mergers and tidal interactions stripping dm and leaving a `` naked '' gc by @xmath22 .",

    "to evaluate the plausibility of the scenario depicted in section  [ sec : model ] , and compute the gc formation rate , their ages , and spatial distribution at @xmath22 we resort to a dm - only cosmological simulation run with gadget2 @xcite , with setup described in @xcite , and @xcite , but tailored volume / mass resolution and updated cosmology ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ; @xcite ) .",

    "after such time we no longer consider a gc as the outcome of a major minihalo merger .",
    "furthermore , we define the minimum mass ratio between progenitor halos as @xmath60 .",
    "finally , we save ids for all particles involved in gc formation to track halo membership , check for subsequent mergers , and characterize their spatial distribution at @xmath22 through i d re - mapping into the lower resolution run .",
    "our simplified gas treatment from dm - only simulations ignores the relative velocity difference between baryons and cdm imprinted at recombination time , which can significantly impact formation of high-@xmath11 halos with @xmath61 , suppressing the halo mass function @xcite , and the gas fraction @xcite .",
    "quantifying the impact of stream velocity for gc formation is difficult without a hydrodynamic simulation , because of competing effects .",
    "gas - rich minihalo mergers require progenitors where population - iii star formation is suppressed . in our framework",
    "this happens because of @xmath14 photodissociation , but stream velocity works as well .",
    "in addition , the halo bias would be higher @xcite , enhancing the merger probability .",
    "overall , the number of gas - rich minihalo mergers may be only moderately suppressed , or possibly even enhanced , in contrast to the @xmath62 suppression of star formation inferred for the general population of minihalos @xcite .",
    "we expect our estimate on the gc birth - rate to be accurate within a factor two or better compared to a full treatment of stream velocity .",
    "figure  [ fig : rate ] shows predictions for the gc formation rate in the most massive simulated halo ( @xmath63 , selected for best statistics ) . at @xmath44 ( universe age @xmath64 ) ,",
    "there are @xmath65 minihalo - minihalo mergers fulfilling the conditions for gc formation .",
    "the average merger redshift is @xmath46 ( @xmath66 ) with dispersion @xmath67 ( age spread @xmath68 myr ) .",
    "minihalo - minihalo merging is strongly peaked with redshift because of competing processes . at @xmath69 atomic cooling halos",
    "are rare , and there is not sufficient time for chemical pollution by outflows originating in nearby star forming sites .",
    "later , as the redshift decreases so does the merger rate @xcite , and at @xmath70 structure formation starts shifting toward larger scales .",
    "this is qualitatively similar to the circumstances leading to the `` gamov peak '' in nuclear astrophysics .",
    "figure  [ fig : rate ] is representative of the average gc formation rate , albeit with significant halo - to - halo scatter .",
    "its bottom panel illustrates the cumulative gc number for the five most massive halos in the box comprising a mass range @xmath71 , as well as the box average .",
    "the number of gcs is normalised by the comoving volume of each halo in the initial conditions ( proportional to halo mass ) .",
    "the box average normalization is the simulation volume .",
    "figure  [ fig : rate ] depicts halo - to - halo variations of a factor two .",
    "furthermore , it shows that more massive halos ( the five blue and red lines ) have slightly older gcs compared to less massive halos ( the box average line ) by about @xmath72 myr .",
    "this is a consequence of the earlier chemical enrichment and biased halo mass function that is found in overdense environments .    with an average time delay of @xmath73 myr",
    ", the large majority of the products of minihalo - minihalo mergers has a minor merger ( progenitor mass ratio @xmath74 ) or receives a mass infall @xmath75 between two snapshots ( @xmath76 myr temporal spacing ) .",
    "major mergers are also frequent : @xmath77 of the first generation clusters has one . more generally , from extended press - schechter modeling ( see @xcite ) we derive that a halo with @xmath78 at @xmath79 will evolve into a descendant that @xmath80 myr later ( by @xmath81 ) has doubled in mass at @xmath82% confidence .",
    "therefore , the high accretion rate on the minihalos suggests that there is sufficient gas to mix , dilute chemically the agb ejecta from first generation stars , and concentrate them at the halo center .",
    "these conditions can lead to formation of multiple stellar populations @xcite , widely observed in galactic gcs @xcite .",
    "however , detailed modeling requires hydrodynamic simulations and is beyond the scope of this initial work , focused on making predictions on the robust ( parameter - free ) probability distribution of gc ages .",
    "our simulation does not include halos especially representative of the mw / local group because of its small volume . nevertheless , since minihalo mergers are a universal process , we can rescale the results to estimate the number of old galactic gcs .",
    "the mw halo mass is debated , ranging from @xmath83 to @xmath84 at @xmath85 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , almost encompassing the halos shown in figure  [ fig : rate ] . in these halos there",
    "are @xmath65 to @xmath86 old gcs , suggesting full consistency between observed frequency and predictions in our framework ( old gcs in the mw are about @xmath87 of the total population , that is @xmath88 ) .",
    "overall , our theoretical estimate of the old gc number is accurate within a factor two , comparable to halo - to - halo variations . for improved estimates ,",
    "gc survival to @xmath22 is also important , as well as detailed modeling of the hydrodynamics ( stream velocity , impact of progenitor mass ratio and cooling timescale @xmath89 ) .",
    "however , all these baryonic processes , including stream velocity , do not affect to first approximation the predicted age distribution , which is the key observable that can falsify our model . in this respect",
    ", we note that the gc `` formation epoch '' shown figure  [ fig : rate ] is that of the minihalo - minihalo merger , and thus an upper limit .",
    "stars form in the following @xmath90 yr ( first generation ) , and possibly a few hundred myr later when further gas accretion triggers subsequent generations . assuming @xmath91 yr as typical delay for the average stellar age since the merger , our best estimate of the absolute age of old gcs is @xmath92 gyr with a @xmath93 spread of @xmath8 gyr .",
    "this is in full agreement with the current determination of ages for the old gc population @xmath94 gyr @xcite .",
    "we predict that , if old gcs formed through mini - halo mergers , improvements in absolute and relative age calibrations should converge toward gc formation during the epoch of reionization and age scatter as small as @xmath95 gyr .",
    "our model quantitatively predicts the age distribution of gcs formed through minihalo - mergers , and produces the correct order of magnitude of objects ( section  [ sec : merger_rate ] ) . to further establish its plausibility , we investigate the expected gc masses , galactocentric distribution and efficiency of tidal stripping in removing dm around gcs by @xmath22 .    a typical star formation efficiency used in studies of high - redshift objects is @xmath96 ( stellar to baryonic mass ratio ; @xcite ) .",
    "this gives for a minihalo with @xmath2 a stellar mass @xmath97 , consistent with the average gc mass @xmath98 @xcite , even if there is a diffuse stellar component formed during the merger ( and later stripped ) .",
    "furthermore , our model has a cut - off scale given by the hi cooling mass , naturally predicting a distribution of masses peaked around a characteristic value ( log - normal type ) , as observed for gcs in both the milky way and external galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the model has no need to invoke preferential disruption of lower mass star clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we discuss model predictions for galactocentric gc distribution and efficiency of tidal stripping of the dm envelope .",
    "we tag in the @xmath22 snapshot the particles associated to gc formation in the high - resolution , high-@xmath11 run .",
    "results are shown in figure  [ fig : rendering ] : tagged particles ( middle panel ) have higher galactocentric concentration compared to all particles ( top panel ) .",
    "the @xmath22 radial density profile of gc particles is shown in figure  [ fig : density_profile ] for a typical non - interacting halo , demonstrating that it follows the slope @xmath99 observed in the distribution of mw gcs .",
    "this is not surprising since minihalo mergers are @xmath100 dm peaks at @xmath101 , which @xcite found to be distributed with a @xmath99 profile by @xmath22 .",
    "the middle panels of figure  [ fig : rendering ] also show a diffuse distribution of particles involved in minihalo mergers .",
    "this supports our proposal that tidal interactions during the merger process strip gcs of their initial dm halos , although the results need to be confirmed by a full high - resolution simulation to @xmath22 .",
    "last , through particle tagging we derive the correlation between @xmath22 galactocentric distance and chemical enrichment ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rendering ] , bottom panels ) . as observed by @xcite",
    ", we qualitatively obtain a negative correlation between galactocentric radius and metallicity , with gcs located centrally enriched by up to @xmath102 polluters , and those in the outskirts having @xmath103 .     for the halo shown in the right panels of figure  [ fig : rendering ] .",
    "the dm density ( black - solid line ) is well represented by a nfw profile ( dashed - blue line ) , while particles associated to minihalo - minihalo mergers have a steeper profile ( solid red ) , consistent with @xmath104 observed in the distribution of galactic gcs ( dotted magenta ) .",
    "profiles have been normalized at @xmath105 . ]",
    "the observed age - metallicity distribution of galactic gcs shows a bimodal population , with about half the objects residing along an `` old '' branch with age @xmath106 gyr and spread comparable to the relative age error @xcite . here , we explored a novel idea to form these old gcs at the center of dm minihalos with virial temperature @xmath107 k ( @xmath2 ) and with the following additional constraints :    * enrichment by metal outflows from nearby population - ii halos rather than by their own population - iii star formation ; * major merger with a similar metal - enriched , but star - free minihalo within a time @xmath108 myr from the crossing of the cooling threshold ( @xmath107 k ) .",
    "the minihalo - minihalo merger is the key new ingredient to create a compact star cluster .",
    "while the details of star formation depend on complex baryonic physics that will be explored in future investigations , we make robust and falsifiable predictions on the probability distribution of the minihalo mergers ( age of gcs ) , which are discussed in section  [ sec : merger_rate ] .",
    "we obtain @xmath109 and @xmath110 , in agreement with current observations .",
    "improvements in gc age measurements can uncontroversially falsify the minihalo merger scenario .",
    "also , model predictions may be within reach of direct observations with the _ james webb space telescope _",
    "in fact , the number density of compact star clusters at @xmath111 is sufficiently high ( @xmath112 arcmin@xmath113 ) that jwst can identify some of them if highly magnified ( @xmath114 ) to @xmath115 by a foreground galaxy cluster .",
    "however , we note that it will be challenging to discriminate against other compact high-@xmath11 objects such as population - iii clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    besides gc ages , other aspects of the framework such as multiple stellar populations formation triggered by minor mergers ( section  [ sec : model ] ) are more speculative , since they depend on a complex interplay between baryonic and dm physics .",
    "we presented consistency checks in section  [ sec : checks ] to characterize qualitatively the distribution of gcs , their metallicity and stripping of the dm halo envelope , but further work is required .",
    "in addition to detailed investigation of dm stripping , perhaps one interesting aspect to follow - up is the connection between gcs and dwarf galaxies . while earlier studies considered them as two distinct classes in the luminosity - size plane , recent work unveiled the existence of ultracompact dwarf galaxies with intermediate properties ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , our framework predicts a continuum between classical dwarf galaxies ( no major mergers at formation , dm dominated ) and old gcs ( major merger , dm envelope stripped by @xmath22 ) .",
    "overall , minihalo mergers appear to provide a promising scenario to explore for the formation of the oldest gcs observed in today s galaxies ."
