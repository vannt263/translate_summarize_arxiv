    "the convergence of a variety of simulated forest statistics with resolution and box size has been explored in detail at @xmath9 , both for eulerian grid and lagrangian sph simulations ( @xcite ) . in recent years , however , the importance of the @xmath10 forest as a probe of the hydrogen reionisation epoch ( @xcite ) has led to considerable interest in the properties of hydrodynamical forest simulations at the _",
    "highest _ observable redshifts ( @xcite ) .    however , it is not obvious that the numerical requirements for simulating the forest at @xmath10 are the same as at lower redshifts .",
    "the average transmission of the forest decreases towards higher redshift as the physical gas density increases and the intensity of the ultraviolet ( uv ) background falls .",
    "absorption lines associated with the mildly overdense regions of the igm at @xmath11 are gradually replaced by transmission peaks from underdense regions , culminating in completely saturated absorption by @xmath12 .",
    "the decrease in the characteristic overdensity associated with the forest towards higher redshift will place strong demands on sph simulations , which naturally focus on resolving high density regions , as a function of time .    in this letter",
    "we analyse a large set of cosmological simulations performed with an upgraded version of the sph code gadget-2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we consider the convergence of two widely used forest flux statistics , the mean flux and the flux power spectrum , with mass resolution and box size .",
    "we also examine the gas density distribution in our simulations in detail .",
    "although some of the issues discussed in this letter are generally appreciated , there have been no studies of sph forest simulations at @xmath13 where they are highlighted explicitly .",
    "our intention is that these results will provide a useful reference for future modelling of the forest at the highest observable redshifts .",
    "we perform @xmath14 hydrodynamical simulations using gadget-3 , an upgraded version of the publicly available parallel tree - sph code gadget-2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the simulations are summarised in table  [ tab : sims ] , and cover a wide range of comoving box sizes and gas particle masses .",
    "the simulations are all started at @xmath15 , with initial conditions constructed using the same random seed .",
    "the cosmological parameters are ( @xmath16 . these are consistent with the fifth year _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( wmap ) data ( @xcite ) aside from @xmath17 , which is in better agreement with forest constraints ( @xcite ) . the gas is assumed to be of primordial composition with a helium mass fraction of @xmath18 . the gravitational softening length is set to @xmath19 of the mean linear interparticle spacing . star formation is included using a simplified prescription which converts all gas particles with overdensity @xmath20 and temperature @xmath21 into collisionless stars .",
    "the baryons in the simulations are photoionised and heated by the uv background model of @xcite which includes emission from both quasars and galaxies .",
    "the uv background is switched on at @xmath22 and is applied in the optically thin limit using a non - equilibrium ionisation algorithm .",
    "the photo - heating rate is increased by a factor of @xmath23 to give temperatures similar to existing measurements ( @xcite ) .",

    ".mass resolution and box size ( comoving ) of the hydrodynamical simulations used in this work . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : fits ]    this behaviour is a consequence of the spatially adaptive nature of sph , which provides excellent spatial resolution in high density regions but poorer resolution in underdense regions . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sphtest ] we demonstrate this by comparing the density distribution from the 10 - 50 and 10 - 100 models to a third distribution , again drawn from the 10 - 100 model .",
    "the latter is computed by interpolating the particle masses onto a grid using the 10 - 50 model particle smoothing lengths ( twice the 10 - 100 values ) , mimicking particle masses a factor of eight larger . the 10 - 50 distribution at low densities is well reproduced by the resmoothed 10 - 100 distribution , implying that differences in the density distribution at @xmath25 are largely a consequence of the intrinsic mass resolution limit . however",

    "the dotted curves correspond to an eighth order polynomial fit to the simulation data over the range @xmath26 .",
    "the fits obtained by mhr00 correspond to the dashed curves .",

    "the differences in the fits relative to the simulation data are shown in the lower third of each panel.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    lastly , we consider fits to the gas density distribution which are widely used in analytical models of the forest . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] we compare the volume weighted density distribution from our 10 - 400 simulation to the four parameter fits , with a box size of @xmath28 box and @xmath29 cells .",
    "this gives an average gas mass per cell of @xmath30 .",

    "obtained at @xmath31 by @xcite ( hereafter mhr00 ) .",
    "the solid curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] correspond to our 10 - 400 simulation data , while the dashed curves show the fits obtained by mhr00 .",
    "the dot - dashed curve at @xmath27 corresponds to a more recent fit , a box size of @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( @xmath34 gas particles ) . ] to an sph simulation by @xcite ( hereafter pss09 ) , who also use the parameterisation suggested by mhr00 .",
    "although our simulation is in reasonable agreement with the mhr00 fits for @xmath35 , we confirm the claim by pss09 that the power law tail in the mhr00 parameterisation , @xmath36 for @xmath37 , provides a poor description of the density distribution .",
    "this is perhaps not too surprising ; the mhr00 prescription is based on the assumption of a power - law density profile for collapsed objects and is not obtained directly from the simulations .",
    "the 10 - 400 model also differs considerably from the mhr00 fits at @xmath25 , although note that our data are not fully converged here .",
    "the pss09 fit is in poor agreement with our simulation at @xmath27 .",
    "however , pss09 find a similar discrepancy between their fit and simulation results , suggesting that the difference between their _ simulated _ density distribution and our data is actually much smaller .",
    "furthermore , we use a very different star formation prescription to pss09 which is designed to optimise forest simulations .",
    "we have verified this has little effect on the simulated gas density distribution at @xmath38 when compared to a more sophisticated star formation prescription ( @xcite ) , but this choice will produce differences in the density distribution at higher densities .    we conclude that the mhr00 parameterisation is not fully adequate for describing @xmath39 from our simulations at @xmath40 . consequently , we provide polynomial fits to the 10 - 400 density distribution in table 2 over the range @xmath26 _ only _ ( dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] ) .",
    "we deliberately avoid parameterising the data , preferring to instead provide an accurate representation of the simulations for reference .",
    "note , however , that @xmath39 is still only marginally converged with resolution for @xmath41 and has not fully converged with box size .",
    "we perform a large set of cosmological sph simulations to explore the effect of mass resolution and box size on two key forest flux statistics . as noted in many previous studies ( see @xcite for a review ) , we find a mass resolution of @xmath42 is more than adequate for simulating mean flux and power spectrum at @xmath6 . however , towards higher redshift the mass resolution requirement for convergence becomes significantly stricter , with a gas particle mass _ at least _ 8 times smaller required at @xmath1 .",
    "we demonstrate this is largely a consequence of the intrinsic resolution limit of sph simulations in low density regions .",
    "although a @xmath43 box is adequate for simulating the mean flux at @xmath6 , a @xmath7 box is required for the power spectrum , and this is preferred for both statistics at @xmath1 .",
    "we also briefly demonstrate that the mhr00 parameterisation for the gas density distribution , although in reasonable agreement with our 10 - 400 model at moderate overdensities , provides a poor description of the simulation for @xmath3 .",
    "although our results will hold in general for sph forest simulations , in detail they will only be exact for the specific models we present .",
    "convergence requirements will always depend on the physical process under consideration , as well as the precision of the observational data to which the simulations are compared .",
    "we have also assumed that the @xmath44 forest is dominated by transmission from underdense regions in the igm .",
    "this picture is correct if the uv background is spatially uniform , but if there are large fluctuations in the ionising radiation field at @xmath44 , localised patches of highly ionised gas will complicate this interpretation somewhat .",
    "lastly , at lower redshifts where the forest transmission is dominated by mildly overdense regions , sph simulations produce results comparable to those from state - of - the - art adaptive mesh codes ( @xcite )",
