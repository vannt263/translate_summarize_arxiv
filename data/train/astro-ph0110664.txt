    "many experiments have been designed to analyze the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy .",
    "the signal to be detected is the superposition of various components . in the inflationary models considered here , the components generated during linear evolution ( sachs - wolfe , doppler , and so on ) are dominant and gaussian ; nevertheless , there are subdominant non gaussian components as those due to non - linear gravity ( rees - sciama ) , lens distortions , and contaminant foregrounds .",
    "the characterization of all these subdominant components , including deviations with respect to gaussianity , is necessary for data analysis in experiments as map and planck .",
    "the rees - sciama effect was studied , using n - body simulations , by seljak ( 1996 ) and tuluie , laguna & anninos ( 1996 ) ; nevertheless , deviations with respect to gaussianity were not considered at all by these authors .",
    "the third order moment of the rees - sciama effect was estimated , using second order perturbation theory ( not a fully non - linear method describing strongly non - linear evolution ) , by mollerach et al .",

    "we are mainly concerned with the deviations with respect to gaussianity produced by fully non - linear gravity ( rees - sciama effect ) . a new general numerical method specially designed to estimate these deviations",
    "is proposed .",
    "it is based on n - body simulations . using this method ,",
    "some statistical moments are estimated for the first time .",
    "quantities @xmath1 and @xmath2 are defined as follows : @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 stand for the density parameters corresponding to baryons , dark matter , and vacuum , respectively .",
    "quantity h is the reduced hubble constant .",
    "we work in the framework of a standard inflationary ( flat ) model with cold dark matter , having @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "the power spectrum has been normalized with @xmath12 according with eke et al.(1996 ) , who estimated @xmath13 to get cluster abundances compatible with observations .",
    "in such a model , scalar energy density fluctuations are initially gaussian , and they remain gaussian during linear evolution ; nevertheless , deviations with respect to gaussianity arise in the non - linear evolution ( where fourier modes mix ) .    in this paper , we are concerned with the cmb temperature distribution .",
    "this field can be developed in spherical harmonics ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "taking into account the cosmological principle , the cmb temperature is assumed to be a realization of a homogeneous and isotropic statistical field and , as a consequence of this assumption , the @xmath15 dependence of the bispectrum has in terms of the wigner-3j symbols the well known form : @xmath16 on account of this formula , we can take @xmath17 to compute @xmath18 and , then , eq .",
    "( [ bi ] ) allows us to calculate @xmath19 for other @xmath15 values .",
    "the @xmath15 dependence of the trispectrum is given explicitly by hu ( 2001 ) .",
    "if non - linear evolution is not considered at all , namely , under the assumption that the cmb anisotropy is only produced by linear inflationary fluctuations ( which are gaussian as a result of the generation mechanism ) , the @xmath20 coefficients appear to be statistically independent gaussian quantities with zero means and variances @xmath21 .",
    "in this situation ( see grishchuk & martin 1997 ) , all the odd moments ( mean , bispectrum , and so on ) vanish , the spectrum is given by @xmath22 , and the higher order even moments can be written as functions of the @xmath23 quantities , in particular , the relation @xmath24 is satisfied . in order to test that non - gaussianity develops during non - linear evolution , deviations with respect to this relation and also with respect to a vanishing bispectrum are investigated .    along this paper , units are chosen in such a way that the speed of light is @xmath25 and , whatever quantity `` @xmath26 '' may be , @xmath27 and @xmath28 stand for the @xmath26 values on the last scattering surface and at present time , respectively .",
    "we focus our attention on the anisotropy generated while the cmb photons move through the gravitational field produced by non - linear cosmological structures .",
    "it is worthwhile to distinguish two types of these structures : ( 1 ) mildly non - linear structures having spatial scales larger than those of the clusters ( superclusters , voids , great attractor - like structures ) , and ( 2 ) strongly non - linear structures with spatial scales either smaller or equal to those of the clusters . in case",
    "( 1 ) , computations can be performed by using second order perturbation theory as in mollerach et al .",
    "1995 and munshi , souradeep & starobinski 1995 or , perhaps , the zeldovich approach and its generalizations ; nevertheless , case ( 2 ) requires numerical computations based on n - body schemes .",
    "we focus our attention on strongly non - linear structures as clusters , which could produce significant deviations from gaussianity , in particular , during the process of violent relaxation .",
    "these structures started to be non - linear ( to undergone violent relaxation ) at low redshifts of about @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) .    in our flat @xmath0cdm model , the potential approximation ( martnez - gonzlez , sanz & silk 1990 , 1994 ; sanz et al .",
    "1996 ) , can be used to get the following basic equation : @xmath31 and @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the relative temperature variation with respect to the background temperature along the direction @xmath34 , and the integral is to be computed , from emission at the last scattering surface ( @xmath35 ) to observation ( @xmath36 ) , along the background null geodesics .",
    "symbols @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , stand for the comoving coordinates , the peculiar gravitational potential , the peculiar velocity , the background mass density , the density contrast , the scale factor , the cosmological time , and the gravitational constant , respectively . since we are interested in a gravitational effect , the subdominant baryonic component can be neglected and , consequently , the density contrast  appearing in eq .",
    "( [ lapla]) can be evolved using n - body simulations .",
    "our simulations start at @xmath46 to be sure that all the period of non - linear evolution is taken into account .",
    "the rees - sciama effect produced by non - linear structures located at redshift @xmath47 is given by the third term of the r.h.s .",
    "( [ efun ] ) , which can be approximated as follows : @xmath48_{_{i } } \\simeq   - 2 \\int_{t_{50}}^{t_{o } } \\vec{\\nabla } \\phi \\cdot d \\vec{x } \\simeq 2 \\int_{t_{50}}^{t_{o } } \\frac { \\partial \\phi ( \\vec{x},t ) } { \\partial t } dt$ ] , where @xmath49 stands for the cosmological time at redshift @xmath46 .",
    "since the anisotropy under consideration can be calculated as an integral of @xmath50 , the angular scales of this anisotropy are not those subtended by the density contrast itself , but those corresponding to the potential @xmath39 ( see fullana & sez 2000 ) .",
    "the remainder of this section is a qualitative discussion about angular scales and resolution .",
    "no accurate computations are necessary and spherically symmetric structures can be considered . according to the cosmological principle , any spherical cosmological structure",
    "is compensated at a certain distance or compensation radius @xmath51 .",
    "the peculiar mass ( excess or defect ) inside a sphere of radius @xmath52 , hereafter @xmath53 , vanishes at @xmath54 and , taking into account the relation @xmath55 which follows from eq .",
    "( [ lapla ] ) in the spherically symmetric case , the potential @xmath56 does not depend on @xmath52 for @xmath54 , furthermore , this constant potential must vanishes in order to get a good asymptotic behaviour .",
    "this means that a given compensated structure only produces a significant gravitational potential in the region @xmath57 ; namely , inside a sphere with diameter @xmath58 . in the linear regime",
    ", the peculiar velocity produced by a structure is @xmath59 .",
    "although this relation does not hold in the central non - linear region of a cluster , it roughly holds in the outer regions , where compensation takes place and the density contrast is low .",
    "hence , the peculiar velocity vanishes for @xmath54 , at the same place where the gravitational potential vanishes by compensation .",
    "if the clustering of clusters is neglected  a good approach in our qualitative analysis and the present mean separation between neighbouring clusters is @xmath60 mpc , then , the mean distance , at redshift @xmath61 , is @xmath62 mpc and , consequently , given two similar neighbouring clusters , each of them should become roughly compensated at the centre of the segment joining the cluster centres ( where peculiar velocity vanishes ) ; therefore , the radius of the region where the potential of a given cluster at redshift @xmath61 is not negligible appears to be @xmath63 .",
    "let us now consider virgo cluster , which is a standard cluster .",
    "it is well known that the peculiar velocity produced by the virgo cluster on the local group ranges between @xmath64 and @xmath65 km / s ; hence , taking into account that the distance from the local group to the cluster centre is @xmath66 mpc ( @xmath67 mpc ) , we can conclude that the virgo cluster has not been fully compensated at a distance of @xmath67 mpc from its centre .",
    "this strongly suggests that , effective compensation should take place between @xmath68 mpc ( @xmath69 ) @xmath70 mpc ( @xmath71 ) ; this second value of @xmath72 seems a bit large , although an admissible value in the case of abell clusters , for which , compensation should be produced at distances greater than those corresponding to virgo - like structures .    in a flat universe with cosmological constant ,",
    "the angle subtended by the distance @xmath62 mpc placed at redshift @xmath61 is @xmath73 where @xmath74^{1/2 } } \\ ; \\ ] ] using these formulae , we have calculated the @xmath75 value corresponding to the angular scale @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) as a function of @xmath61 .",
    "the results are displayed in fig . 1 for @xmath78 ( solid line ) , @xmath79 ( dotted line ) , @xmath80 ( dashed line ) , and @xmath81 ( dashed - dotted line ) . in this figure we see that , from @xmath82 to @xmath83 , where clusters undergo violent relaxation and the non - linear gravitational anisotropy should be mainly produced , the @xmath84 values range in the interval ( 100,800 ) .",
    "for @xmath85 , clusters have relaxed and , for @xmath86 , they are at the first stages of their non - linear evolution .    for the sake of briefness and clearness , only the scale @xmath87 ( with @xmath88 ) has been considered in our calculations .",
    "let us now justify this choice taking into account fig .",
    "the method proposed in this paper might be sensitive to both the degree of non - linearity and the speed of the @xmath39 evolution .",
    "strong non - linearities and large values of @xmath89 ( violent relaxation ) could lead to numerical problems .",
    "non - linearity requires good spatial resolution in the n - body simulation , and fast @xmath39 evolution requires appropriate time steps in both the n - body simulation , and the numerical integrations along the line of sight ( see below ) .",
    "1 shows that non - linear clusters of different sizes located between redshifts 0.5 and 5 ( some of them undergoing violent relaxation ) are contributing to @xmath87 , whereas only small clusters located at @xmath83 ( well before violent relaxation ) are contributing to @xmath90 ; therefore , @xmath87 seems to be a good choice in order to test our method taking into account both non - linear evolution and violent relaxation .",
    "moreover , in the model under consideration , the first acoustic peak is located at @xmath91 and , around @xmath92 , there is a minimum of the linear dominant gaussian effects .",
    "cluster evolution is simulated in boxes having at present time @xmath93 mpc per edge with a resolution of @xmath94 mpc .",
    "this choice is a balance between the need of having a reasonable number of clusters inside the box ( order ten ) and the need of following the non - linear evolution of the gravitational potential .",
    "the minimum scale we resolve , @xmath94 mpc , is typically of the order of the cluster virial radius and , consequently , non - linear enough .",
    "the fine structure within the core cluster is not resolved , but it does not seem to be necessary because the effect under consideration is produced by the gravitational potential , which smoothes all the substructure on the scales we are interested in .",
    "the effects produced by substructures ( @xmath95 and strong clustering ) should appear on angular scales corresponding to @xmath96 , for which more resolution would be necessary .",
    "n - body simulations are performed by using a standard particle - mesh code ( hockney & eastwood 1988 ) , which was used , tested , and described in more detail by quilis , ibaez & sez ( 1998 ) .",
    "we are interested in non - gaussianity and , consequently , our goal is not the computation of the angular power spectrum ( @xmath23 coefficients ) corresponding to the third term of eq .",
    "( [ efun ] ) .",
    "this spectrum was given by seljak ( 1996 ) for the rees - sciama effect , and by fullana & sez ( 2000 ) for the integrated sachs - wolfe effect .",
    "we are looking for the bispectrum , trispectrum and so on .",
    "this fact facilitates our implementation of n - body simulations . in the case",
    "@xmath87 , according to fig .",
    "1 , cluster - like structures ( @xmath97 ) are contributing to the rees - sciama effect inside the redshift interval ( 0.5,5 ) , whereas structures as superclusters , the great attractor , and so on ( @xmath98 ) , are contributing for @xmath99 , just when they were almost linear objects ; hence , these structures can only produce a very small almost gaussian integrated effect for @xmath87 ( see fullana & sez 2000 ) , and no important deviation from gaussianity are expected ; hence , even if we partially include superclusters and larger structures ( small box size ) , we can get very accurate estimations of the deviations with respect to gaussianity ( associated to strong non - linearity ) .",
    "since we are mainly interested in the evolution of the gravitational potential of clusters and substructures and , moreover , the chosen box is much larger than the size of the region where the potential of standard clusters is significant , the fourier transform can be performed in our box ( as it is done in next section ) ; namely , no important artifacts are expected as a result of the periodicity of an universe filled by boxes identical to the chosen one .",
    "the basic equations necessary for the numerical computation of the bispectrum and other statistical moments are first derived using the potential approximation and , then , a numerical method for the implementation of these equations based on n - body simulations is described and applied .",
    "at present time , the observer is assumed to be located at a certain point with comoving spatial coordinates @xmath100 .",
    "the equations of the null geodesic passing by point @xmath100 are : @xmath101 where the function @xmath102 can be written as follows : @xmath103 with @xmath104 since we are interested in the deviations from gaussianity produced by non - linear gravity , the third term of the r.h.s . of eq .",

    "our method is different from other ones previously used to estimate deviations from gaussianity due to weak lensing .",
    "according to white & hu ( 2001 ) , there are too much scales contributing to lensing and _ simulating the full range of scales implied is currently a practical impossibility _ ; sophisticated techniques as `` special projections '' ( jain , seljak & white 2000 ) or `` tiling '' ( white & hu 2001 ) have been designed to circumvent the problem ; nevertheless , we are not considering lensing here and , as discussed in section 2 , the estimate of the deviations with respect to gaussianity produced by the rees - sciama effect only requires simulations involving a moderated range of scales , which can be performed ( see section 2 ) . in addition , in the rees - sciama case , some analytical calculations ( section 3 ) have given formulae to simultaneously calculate the @xmath123 quantities of many observers , from which , the successive statistical moments are calculated by performing appropriate averages .    condition ( [ inter ] ) plays a fundamental role in our numerical method .",

    "( [ clave ] ) are ( in this paper ) evaluated step by step at each node of the computational grid and , consequently , the calculation of @xmath123 although feasible in modern computers has not a low computational cost .",
    "it is worthwhile to remark that , once the quantities @xmath123 have been calculated , we can obtain , not only one , but many different moments of the temperature distribution with very small effort ( by computing the necessary averages on nodes and realizations ) .    with the essential aim of finding non - gaussian features and proving that the proposed method works , we have only considered the case @xmath92 , @xmath88 . for very different @xmath75 values computations would be similar , but",
    "the range of spatial scales , the box , and the resolution should be chosen again taking into account fig .",
