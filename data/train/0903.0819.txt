    "the dynamical variables of the electromagnetic ( em ) field define its mechanical identity and are essential for understanding the effects of the field on charged particles . as a consequence , finding the natural dynamical variables of the em field and their relations to mode properties has been directly linked to the development of classical and quantum em theory .",
    "historically , the photon concept emerged from suggesting a definite relationship between the energy ( linear momentum ) of a photon and the frequency @xmath0 ( wave vector @xmath1 ) of plane waves .",
    "similarly , the relationship between the angular momentum of em waves and their polarization is very important for understanding , e. g. , atomic processes mediated by photons .",
    "photons associated to em modes with non cartesian symmetries are characterized by sets of dynamical constants different from those of plane waves .",
    "an example corresponds to circular - cylindrical em waves known as bessel modes @xcite or their paraxial analogue , i. e. , laguerre - gaussian beams @xcite .",
    "bessel photons carry a well defined orbital angular momentum @xcite proportional to the winding number @xmath2 of their vortices @xcite .",
    "another example corresponds to mathieu modes which exhibit elliptical - cylindrical symmetry .",
    "mathieu photons carry constant values for the balanced composition of the orbital angular momentum with respect to the foci of the elliptical coordinate system @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to analyze the mechanical properties of the em modes for the last coordinate system with translational symmetry along an axis known to have separable analytical solutions , i. e. , the parabolic - cylindrical coordinate system .",
    "the solutions of the corresponding wave equation can be expressed in terms of weber functions , giving this name to the em modes .",
    "we show that a balanced composition of a component of the lineal momentum with a component of the angular momentum is a natural dynamical variable for these modes .",
    "weber photons carry a well defined value of this variable .",
    "weber beams of zero - order have already been experimentally generated by means of a thin annular slit modulated by the proper angular spectra @xcite .",
    "this setup was conceived as a variation of that originally used by durnin et al.@xcite for generating bessel beams .",

    "these equations are known as parabolic cylinder or weber differential equations .",
    "solutions for this differential set can be expressed as frobenius series , parabolic cylinder functions , whittaker functions , hermite functions , and others @xcite . here , the solutions are expressed in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions of the first kind,@xmath25 : @xmath26 @xmath27 with @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) for even ( odd ) parity functions : @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) .",

    ", @xmath43 can be related to the product of the z - component of the angular momentum and the y - component of the linear momentum .",

    "this theorem states that @xcite , if under an infinitesimal transformation of the space coordinates @xmath59 and the field @xmath60 the lagrangian is left invariant , then the current @xmath61 has a null divergence . as a consequence , @xmath62 defines the density of a dynamical variable whose integrated value over a volume can change only due to the flux of the current @xmath63 through the surface that delimits the volume .",
    "since we are working with em modes that have a particular symmetry the subset of all possible transformations whose generators are directly identified from the eigenvalue equations  ( [ eq : par]-[eq : a ] ) is particularly relevant . under an infinitesimal translation along the main direction of propagation @xmath64 or a time translation @xmath65 , the em field changes according to the expressions @xmath66 or @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "this is reflected in the fact that the field momentum - like variable @xmath68 is independent of time if the integration is taken over the whole space .",

    "in fact , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are proportional to each other with @xmath72 the constant of proportionality .",
    "notice that , in both cases , the dynamical constant can be inferred from the factor @xmath73 defined in eq .",

    "the noether term @xmath86 , eq.([eq : extrinsec ] ) , defines the density of the @xmath7-component of the orbital angular momentum @xmath87 for weber modes , similarly to periodic plane waves @xcite , @xmath88 with the latter term becoming zero for @xmath89 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath90 thus , a not null orbital angular momentum for a given weber mode @xmath91 in a volume @xmath92 can be due just to a flux of the vector field @xmath93 through the boundary surface .",
    "let us consider @xmath94 as generator of a transformation for the vector field @xmath77 .",
    "noether theorem as described above concerns first order differential operators as generators of continuous symmetries while @xmath95 contains second order operators .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath79 term associated to this transformation gives rise to @xmath96 the first resulting term in eq .",

    "it is straightforward to find the reflection properties of the electric field @xmath102 for each mode : @xmath103",
    "standard quantization rules require a proper normalization of the em modes so that each travelling photon carries an energy @xmath104 .",
    "the classical electric field amplitude is substituted by the electric field per photon times the creation operator for the given travelling mode , @xmath105 , @xmath106 .",

    "as for the helicity , @xmath111 a quantum analysis of the relation between polarization and helicity can be carried out in analogy with the study in ref .",
    "@xcite for bessel fields . finally , in the quantum realm the field operator associated to @xmath94 is @xmath112 an overall factor @xmath113 was introduced so that the dynamical variable @xmath114 for a photon has units of linear momentum times angular momentum as expected for the quantum variable associated to @xmath115 .",
    "the parabolic - cylindrical modes differ from other separable cylindrical modes by having @xmath116 as a symmetry operator .",
    "we showed that the quantum numbers of the em modes @xmath117 are related to their linear momentum along @xmath7 , the energy , and the symmetrized product of the angular momentum along @xmath7 and the momentum along @xmath6 .",
    "the helicity , a property intrinsic to the vector nature of the em field , was shown to be diagonal in the circular basis resulting from the complex superposition of te and tm modes .",
    "the dynamical variable @xmath99 is gauge dependent although it can be written in a gauge independent looking form for monochromatic modes for which @xmath118 .",
    "contrary to standard em dynamical variables which depend on products of @xmath81 and @xmath119 , @xmath120 depends on the products of @xmath81 , @xmath119 , and their derivatives .",
    "since weber em modes form a complete set , @xmath121 will be a conserved quantity for any em wave @xmath77 whenever the flux of @xmath120 through asymptotic parabolic cylinder surfaces at infinity is null .",
    "this flux can be evaluated writing the given em field @xmath77 as a superposition of weber modes and applying eq .",
    "( [ eq : barb ] ) .",
    "the mechanical effects of weber beams on cold atoms deserve a detailed study both quantum mechanically and semiclassically ( in complete analogy to that already done for mathieu beams @xcite ) . however , there are some qualitative features that can be expected without performing such an analysis . for instance , since under stationary conditions , cold noninteracting atoms in a red - detuned light beam have a higher probability of being located in the higher intensity regions of the beam , the corresponding squared atomic wave function mimics the intensity pattern of the light field .",
    "thus , for a weber lattice , the atomic wave function is expected to have a geometrical structure similar to that of the scalar weber function , eq .",
