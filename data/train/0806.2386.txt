    "<S> transverse - field muon spin rotation ( tf-@xmath0sr ) experiments in the heavy - fermion superconductor pros@xmath1sb@xmath2 ( @xmath3 k ) suggest that the superconducting penetration depth @xmath4 is temperature - independent at low temperatures , consistent with a gapped quasiparticle excitation spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , radiofrequency ( rf ) inductive measurements yield a stronger temperature dependence of @xmath4 , indicative of point nodes in the gap . </S>",
    "<S> muon knight shift measurements in the normal state of pros@xmath1sb@xmath2 suggest that the perturbing effect of the muon charge on the neighboring pr@xmath5 crystalline electric field is negligibly small , and therefore is unlikely to cause the difference between the tf-@xmath0sr and rf results . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy appears to be related to multiband superconductivity in pros@xmath1sb@xmath2 . </S>"
