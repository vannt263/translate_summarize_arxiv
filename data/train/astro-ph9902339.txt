    "ultraluminous iras galaxies ( ulirgs ) , characterized by their high far - infrared luminosities @xmath1 ( for @xmath2 ) , are the most luminous galaxies in the local universe ( see sanders & mirabel 1996 for a review ) .",
    "most ulirgs show signs of interaction and/or merging .",
    "these processes are believed to trigger starbursts and central nuclear activities which in turn produce intense infrared emissions via dust absorption and re - emission .",
    "some ulirgs do not show prominent interaction signatures ( at least from ground - based imaging ) , but these could be advanced mergers , as is the case for the ulirgs with highest luminosities ( @xmath3 , for @xmath4 ) .",
    "these ulirgs may represent an important stage in formation of qsos and powerful radio galaxies , and may also present a primary stage in the formation of elliptical galaxies .",
    "( sanders et al 1988a ; sanders & mirabel 1996 ; melnick & mirabel 1990 ) .",
    "although the ultimate fate of the ulirgs is not yet fully understood , more and more observations show that the remnants of the mergers resemble elliptical galaxies or s0 galaxies .",
    "for example , the surface brightness profile of iras 20551 - 4250 is reasonably well fitted by the 14 law ( johansson 1991 ) .",
    "arp 220 and ngc 6240 , two nearest ulirgs , both have densities , velocity dispersions and central surface brightness distributions consistent with the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies ( doyon et al 1994 ) .",
    "baker & clements ( 1997 ) investigated the old stellar population for 10 nearby ulirgs based on deep near - infrared imaging and concluded that 8 out of 10 ulirgs show signs of elliptical structure .    on the theoretical side",
    ", toomre & toomre ( 1972 ) first successfully reproduced the observed bridges and tails using restricted three - body simulations of two colliding disk galaxies . in 1977 ,",
    "toomre put forward the hypothesis that all elliptical galaxies could be remnants of merged disk galaxies .",
    "later simulations improved the spatial resolutions , explored more phase space of the encounter geometry and incorporated more realistic treatments of the progenitors , adding components such as bulges , massive dark matter haloes and gas ; crude treatment of star formation is also attempted ( e.g. white 1978 ; farouki & shapiro 1982 ; negroponte & white 1983 ; barnes 1992 ; hernquist 1992 ; heyl et al 1994 ; barnes & hernquist 1996 ; weil & hernquist 1996 ; walker et al 1996 ; mihos & hernquist 1994 ) .",
    "these simulations conclude that a wide range of initial conditions can result in the formation of early - type - like galaxies ( see de zeeuw & franx 1991 for a review ) .",
    "besides the global elliptical - like characteristics of the remnants of simulated mergers ( e.g. the 14 law of the surface brightness profile ) , some simulations also attempt to reveal the fine structure of the remnants such as the shape of the isophote , loops , shells and tails ( see e.g. heyl et al 1994 ; springel & white 1998 ) . as mergers of galaxy pairs may not account for all observed properties of ellipticals , multiple mergers have been considered ( mamon 1987 , barnes 1984 , barnes 1985 , barnes 1989 , schweizer 1989 ; weil & hernquist 1996 ) ; multiple merging may occur in compact groups such as those found by hickson ( 1982 , 1993 ) .",
    "while the simulations indicate that merging of two or more disk galaxies can easily lead to the formation of ellipticals , it is clearly important to test these predictions empirically . for this purpose , ulirgs are ideal since they are closely related to galaxy merging and interactions ( e.g. , murphy et al 1996 , clements et al 1996 ) . in this paper",
    ", we analyze the surface photometry for 13 ulirgs observed with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) , and examine whether their profiles resemble the 14 law , as one would expect if they ultimately form elliptical galaxies .",
    "the resolution of hst provides us a powerful way to study the inner profiles and the fine structure details in these galaxies .",
    "we will also address the important question whether the surface photometry of these galaxies are associated with the central active galactic nuclei ( agn ) phenomenon .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we describe how we select our ulirg sample .",
    "data reduction including surface photometry is described in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "we classify these galaxies according to their surface brightness profiles . in section 5",
    ", we discuss the spectroscopic properties of these galaxies , using both newly obtained spectra and data from the literature . in section 6 , we summarize and discuss the implications of our results . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt an einstein - de sitter universe ( @xmath5 ) and denote the hubble constant as @xmath6 . since our objects are at relatively low redshift ( @xmath7 ) , the assumption about the density parameter ( @xmath8 ) is not critical , and @xmath9 corresponds to roughly @xmath10 for @xmath11 .",
    "in this study , we use archive images from an hst snapshot survey of ultraluminous iras galaxies ( borne et al 1998 ) .",
    "this snapshot survey was taken using the wfpc2 in the i bandpass ( f814w ) .",
    "the objects observed were mainly selected from the following samples : the bright samples of sanders et al ( 1988a , b ) and melnick & mirabel ( 1990 ) , and the qdot sample ( leech et al 1994 ; lawrence et al 1999 ) . for each target in this survey , two 400s exposures were taken .",
    "most of target galaxies are centered on the wide field camera chip 3 ( 800@xmath12800 pixels , @xmath13 per pixel ) and a few in the planetary camera chip ( 800@xmath12800 pixels , @xmath14 per pixel ) . for details of this survey , see borne et al ( 1998 ) . in total , there are 58 images available to us from march 1996 to jan .",
    "1997 ( except that was taken in may 1997 ) .",
    "the redshifts of these objects range from @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    ".journal of observations [ cols=\"<,<,>,^ \" , ]     @xmath17 ned ; @xmath18 spectra of qdot ; @xmath19 lawrence et al 1999 ; @xmath20 kim et al 1998 ; @xmath21 our observation      in order to address the questions mentioned in the introduction , we checked the one - dimensional surface brightness profiles obtained through isophote ellipse fitting .",
    "we fit the radial profiles with a srsic ( 1968 ) law ( marleau & simard 1998 ) : i(r)=i_e ( -b[(r r_e)^1/n-1 ] ) ,   b = 1.9992n-0.3271 , where @xmath22 is the surface brightness at radius @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the effective radius within which half of the light is enclosed ( capaccioli 1989 ) . the de vaucouleurs 14 profile , which is usually used to describe elliptical galaxies and bulges , is a special case of ( 1 ) with @xmath25 , and the exponential profile , which is used to describe galactic disks , is also a special case with @xmath26 .",
    "table 2 gives the properties for these galaxies , including their redshifts , magnitudes , infrared luminosities and spectral classifications .",
    "the integrated apparent wfpc2 magnitude is obtained from aperture photometry in the sky - subtracted and star - masked image using the formula from holtzman et al ( 1995 ) ; the apparent magnitude is then converted into absolute magnitude using luminosity distances for our cosmology ( no k - correction has been applied ) . in the case of saturated images , only upper limits ( in absolute magnitude ) are given . figs .",
    "1 - 13 ( left panels ) show the hst images for all thirteen galaxies .",
    "each image has @xmath27 pixels , corresponding to @xmath28 on a side .",
    "the middle panels show the contour levels for a smaller region centered on each target , highlighting its environments .",
    "the right panels show the variations of the surface brightness , ellipticity , position angle and @xmath29 as a function of 14 . from the radial surface brightness profiles we classify these galaxies into three classes :",
    "* the first class includes 4 galaxies ; the surface brightness of each galaxy in this class is well fitted by the 14 law with some small deviations at @xmath30 @xmath31 .",
    "these four galaxies have round appearances . *",
    "the second class includes 4 galaxies .",
    "the surface brightness profile for each galaxy in this class has two components : an inner 14 component and an outer component .",
    "there is a bright central nucleus in each of these galaxies .",
    "the best - fit effective radii ( for the 14 component ) for class i and ii galaxies are given in table 2 .",
    "* the remaining 5 galaxies fall into the third class .",
    "these galaxies have surface brightness profiles that deviate significantly from the 14 law .    in the following",
    ", we will discuss the properties of these three classes in detail .",
    "four galaxies ( * , , , * ) belong to class i. the surface brightness profiles for these galaxies are well described by the 14 law , from the very inner part to the outer part as shown in fig . 1 to fig",
    ", the fit is reasonable from 0.5 @xmath31to @xmath32 ; for , the fit is excellent out to @xmath33 .",
    "another common characteristic of these galaxies is that they have round appearance . for each galaxy ,",
    "the _ maximum _ ellipticity of the isophotes is less than 0.30 .",
    "the ellipticities at the effective radius are even smaller .",
    "they are only 0.2 , 0.1 , 0.1 , and 0.1 for , , , , respectively .    however , there are slight deviations from the exact 14 law .",
    "small excesses over the best - fitted curve can be seen in all surface brightness profiles ( right panels in figs . 1 - 4 ) at @xmath34 .",
    "the bump position in each galaxy coincides with the maximum of the ellipticity @xmath35 .",
    "this coincidence reflects small structures in these galaxies .",
    "furthermore , it is very interesting that all four galaxies have disky isophotes ( @xmath36 ) in the very inner regions ( @xmath37 kpc ) , and the position angle change is very large , ( @xmath38 for some galaxies ) .",
    "carollo et al ( 1997 ) analysed hst wfpc2 images for 15 elliptical galaxies . in both f555w and f814w filters ,",
    "the position angle changes are usually less than @xmath39 .",
    "therefore it appears that although the light profile is described by the 14 law , the ellipses still show substantial twists .    from figs . 1 - 4",
    ", it can be seen that all four galaxies exhibit signatures of merging such as short tails , plumes in their outer parts .",
    "except for , all the other galaxies have some other galaxies within the same field of view , but these could be due to chance alignment ( see section 5 ) .",
    "the round appearance of these galaxies provides a clue to the merging environment .",
    "numerical simulations ( e.g. weil & hernquist 1996 ) found that remnants of multiple mergers are more round than the mergers from pair stellar disks ( when projected onto the sky ) .",
    "so the round appearance of the class i galaxies suggests that they may be remnants of multiple mergers . such a possibility is supported by the high percentage of multiple nuclei galaxies in our parent sample of 58 galaxies .",
    "about 50% of these have more than three nuclei .",
    "furthermore , for some of the double - nucleus galaxies , each of the two merging nuclei could contain a pair of galactic nuclei in high - resolution images , similar to arp 220 ( taniguchi & shioya 1998 ) .",
    "therefore , the percentage of the multiple - nucleus galaxies is likely higher than 50% for our sample , supporting the notion that ulirgs may preferentially reside in groups of galaxies ( wu et al 1998 ) .",
    "the physical significance of the disky isophotes at the inner radius ( @xmath40@xmath31 ) and the excesses at ( @xmath30 3@xmath31 ) is not clear .",
    "multiple - waveband observations of ulirgs reveal the presence of massive starbursts in a molecular ring or disk at several hundred pc to kpc in the circumnuclear regions ( e.g. , downes & solomon 1998 ) .",
    "the positions of the inner disky isophotes may reflect the presence of such small disks at the center .",
    "such nuclear disks are also found in numerical simulations where gas is driven inward to the central kpc region and cool efficiently at early stage of galactic encounters ( icke 1985 ; noguchi 1988 ) .",
    "therefore , the inner `` disky '' structure could be the relics of nucleus starburst rings or disks .",
    "the significance of bumps at @xmath30 3@xmath31 is less clear , since even `` normal '' elliptical galaxies do not follow the 14 law perfectly ( e.g. , saglia et al 1997 ) .",
    "these departures could be produced in the merging process by tidal force and/or dynamical friction .",
    "5 - 8 show the four galaxies in class ii .",
    "surface brightness profiles of all these galaxies can be fitted by the 14 law from @xmath41 kpc out to @xmath42 kpc .",
    "the outer parts of these galaxies show clear excess over the 14 law .",
    "we have tried a two - component fitting with an inner 14 component and an outer exponential component .",
    "we find , however , that the fitting is unsatisfactory , meaning that the outer extension is more complex than a simple exponential .",
    "disky isophotes are found in the inner region of each galaxy .",
    "however , this is clearly an artefact caused by the saturated central nuclei , since the diagonals of the quasi - diamond shaped isophotes are almost along the diagonals of the images .",
    "although our classification of these galaxies are based purely on their surface brightness profiles , remarkably , we found that all the four galaxies host luminous bright nuclei and are saturated in the frames .",
    "all the galaxies were classified as seyfert 1 galaxies spectroscopically ( lawrence et al . 1999 ; vader & simon 1987 ; moran et al 1996 ) , and all have luminosities in the qso regime . for details , see sect .",
    "it has a small galaxy with a projected distance of @xmath43 away to the west .",
    "two armlike features are clearly visible .",
    "the optical feature from ground based deep observation looks like that of mrk 231 ( for details see surace et al 1998 ) .",
    "these armlike features could be tidal tails resulting from merging .",
    "there are a number of small galaxies within the same field . in the contour plot , a small galaxy ( g1 ) to the southeast can be detected .",
    "g1 causes the outer contours of to protrude in its direction , indicating that these two galaxies are physically interacting .",
    "this galaxy has an extension to the west .",
    "two objects g1 and g2 are within the same field .",
    "both objects are within a projected distance of 20@xmath31 and could be physically associated with the iras galaxy .",
    "many small and fainter objects are also visible within @xmath44 .",
    "this galaxy is an ir qso and is potentially a member of one important class of transition objects .",
    "detailed discussions for this object will be found in xia et al ( 1999 ) .",
    "the five galaxies in this class have different surface brightness profiles , and so we discuss them in turn .    it is a galaxy with an asymmetric extension , being more diffuse to the northwest , as can be seen in fig .",
    "9 . a small galaxy ( g1 )",
    "is visible about 4@xmath31 ( projected ) to the southwest .",
    "this galaxy is still within the envelope of and could be physically associated with .",
    "a ripple - like material can be separated from the southeast part of the extension .",
    "a loop structure can be seen in the inner part which is similar to spiral arms .",
    "the isophotes are disky within 1@xmath31 .",
    "the surface brightness profile of this source deviates from the 14 law .",
    "if we fit it with the 14  law , we find a bump at @xmath45 kpc and a dent at @xmath46 kpc .",
    "the inner bump is related to the inner arms .",
    "apart from the outer part , this galaxy has a round appearance ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the ripples , loop structures and the deviation from the 14 law suggest that that  is a merging galaxy and is still relaxing towards the 14 light distribution .    from fig .",
    "10 ,  appears to have two nearly symmetric diffuse tails .",
    "nicmos observations reveal two very close nuclei ( borne et al 1998 ) , indicating that this galaxy is a merging galaxy as well .",
    "the position angle of the major axis continuously changes by about 120 degrees from the center to the outer part ; the position angle change in the inner part is more gradual than that in the outer part .",
    "the ellipticity of the inner isophotes is smaller ( about 0.3 ) than the outer value ( about 0.5 ) .",
    "the center of the inner isophotes offsets to the south with respect to that of the outer ones .",
    "the mergering process appears not yet complete for this galaxy .    from both image and surface brightness profile ( see fig .",
    "11 ) , this galaxy appears to have been well relaxed .",
    "remarkably , the surface brightness profile can be well fitted by a single exponential , ranging from @xmath48 to @xmath49 . the central part ( @xmath50 )",
    "has boxy isophotes .",
    "on the other hand , there still exist merger signatures , such as a loop structure ( or inner arms ) in the inner region , fan - like protrusion and thick tail - like material at the outer region ( marked with an arrow in the image ) .",
    "the most significant isophotal feature of  is that the position angle gradually decreases by about @xmath51 .",
    "we speculate that the central boxy isophotes and isophotal twists may be caused by a central bar .",
    "this galaxy has a remarkable morphology as shown in fig .",
    "a thick and luminous tail emerges from the north and bends to the south with a total length of about @xmath52 .",
    "two short tails locate to the south and northwest , respectively . a closer look",
    "reveals that this galaxy has two very close nuclei , which gives rise to the boxy isophotes within 1.2@xmath31 .",
    "although the central parts of the two galaxies have almost merged together , the galaxy is still far from complete relaxation and the surface brightness profile deviates significantly from the 14  law .",
    "there are many small and faint objects within @xmath53 of the source",
    ". it would be interesting to determine the redshifts of these small galaxies to see whether they are physically associated with the source .",
    "it has a surface brightness profile similar to that of the second class , it has an inner component satisfying 14  law and a more extended outer component .",
    "the primary difference is that this galaxy has a fainter nucleus .",
    "the inner region has two fan structures which cause the boxy isophotes at radius @xmath54 ) .",
    "the galaxy protrudes to the northeast and has a faint and slim spiral tail around it in the south .",
    "there are also four fainter galaxies ( g1-g4 ) within the field , indicative of a group environment .",
    "many fainter objects can be found within @xmath55 of the source .",
    "to summarize , the five galaxies in class iii have diverse appearances , including one ( ) with a close double nuclei .",
    "their surface brightness profiles deviate to different degrees from the 14 law , with fitted well by an exponential .",
    "is similar to the objects in class ii except that it has a fainter nucleus .",
    "we will return to the issue of the connection between the three classes of objects in the last section .",
    "our studies so far have concentrated on the photometric properties of our sample galaxies .",
    "clearly it is important to explore the spectroscopic properties of these galaxies in order to further understand these three classes of galaxies . in order to address this question and also to understand the possible group environment which we alluded to in section 4 , we have carried out spectroscopic observations from dec .",
    "20 to dec . 23 , 1998 using the 2.16 m telescope at the xinglong station of beijing astronomical observatory .",
    "we have observed , , and , using a zeiss universal spectrograph mounted on the 2.16 m telescope .",
    "a tektronix 1024@xmath121024 ccd was used giving a wavelength coverage of 4100a to 9100a with a grating of 200a / mm .",
    "the spectral resolutions are 9.3a ( 2 pixels ) .",
    "wavelength calibration was carried out using a he - ar lamp ; the resulting wavelength accuracy is better than 1a .",
    "kpno standard stars were observed to perform flux calibrations .    in the following section , we will present our observational results together with data available in the literature , such as kim et al ( 1998 ) and lawrence et al ( 1999 ) , for these three classes of objects .      the spectrum of is shown in fig .",
    "14 . as can be seen from this figure ,",
    "there are strong emission lines , as well as obvious 4000a break ( redshifted to @xmath304900a ) , g - band and possible caii k and h absorption features .",
    "the balmer absorptions are marginal in this low signal - to - noise ratio spectrum . from the emission line ratios and the classification criteria ( veilleux et al 1995 ; osterbrock et al 1989 ) ,  can be classified as a liner .",
    "compared with the `` e+a''-like spectrum of ulirgs ff j1614 + 3234 and tf j1020 + 6436 ( tran et al 1999 ; breugel 1999 ; see also dressler & gunn 1983 ) , the balmer absorption line features of  is weaker .",
    "nevertheless , the spectral features resemble each other and it indicates that  has a population of young stars with age @xmath56 gyr . combining with the fact that its surface brightness profile is well described by the 14 law , we conclude that  is a young elliptical galaxy resulted from merging .",
    "this is further supported by the fact that  is a radio galaxy , and such galaxies are often associated with merger remnants ( barnes 1998 ) .",
    "we have also observed three galaxies ( g0 , g1 and g2 in fig .",
    "1 ) in the field of .",
    "we found that the redshifts for g0 and g2 are 0.284 and 0.149 , respectively ; the low signal - to - noise ratio and the weak emission features make it difficult to securely identify g1 s redshift .",
    "the redshift of g2 is the same as the redshift given for by ned .",
    "the iras error ellipse ( see fig .",
    "1 ) touches both g0 and g2 , with g0 closer to the center of the error ellipse , so the identification is somewhat ambiguous .",
    "the spectrum , shown in fig .",
    "15 , indicates that g0 is a narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy with extremely strong feii emission . since almost all extremely strong feii emitters are ulirgs , g0 ( at @xmath57 ) is most probably the optical counterpart of the ulirg .",
    "the ned identification seems to have confused the objects g0 and g2 .",
    "incidently g2 is a foreground galaxy at @xmath58 with an hii - region like spectrum",
    ".    for the other two objects in class i ,  is also a seyfert 1 galaxy with fwhm of less than @xmath59 ( lawrence et al 1999 ) while the spectral classification for  is liner .      as for the spectra of galaxies in class ii ,",
    "( i zw 1 ) is a typical narrow line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) galaxy ( moran et al 1996 ) ;  is a nls1-like qso ( xia et al 1999 ) ;  is an ir qso with strong feii emission line and with fwhm of  about @xmath60 ;  is also a qso with strong feii emission line and the fwhm of  is less than @xmath59 from the qdot redshit survey spectrum obtained by the william hershel telescope ( lawrence et al 1999 ) .",
    "it is remarkable that all four galaxies in class ii are classified as seyfert 1 galaxies with strong feii emission lines and relatively narrow permitted emission lines .",
    "furthermore , the optical luminosities for all four galaxies are in the range of qsos . except for",
    ", all the other three objects were detected in the soft x - ray by rosat ( the non - detection of is perhaps because it is the most distant galaxy in the sample ) .",
    "all the three soft x - ray spectra are steep .",
    "therefore , these four objects are nls1-like qsos ( boller et al 1996 ) , or they are en route to normal qsos ( xia et al 1999 ) .      the spectrum for is a typical hii region spectrum ( see fig .",
    "table 2 gives the spectral classifications for the other 4 galaxies in this class based on the data from the literature or the spectra from the qdot redshift survey .  and",
    "are classified as liners based on kim et al ( 1998 ) and our spectrum ( not shown ) , respectively .",
    "as veilleux et al ( 1995 ) pointed out that the excitation mechanism for infrared luminous liners could be shock waves . therefore it is possible that strong shocks are present in  and , as in some starburst galaxies , such as ngc 6240 and ngc 3690 ( heckman et al 1990 ) . to summarize , the statistical spectral properties of class iii objects are very different from those of class i and class ii .",
    "these objects have either hii region - like or liner - like spectrum , consistent with the presence of starbursts in these galaxies without obvious central agns .",
    "from a total of 58 hst wfpc2 i - band snapshot images of ulirgs , we have selected 13 sources that are dominated by a single nucleus to study their surface photometry . according to their surface brightness profiles , we find that these galaxies can be divided into three classes .",
    "below we first briefly summarize their morphology , surface brightness profiles and optical properties , and then discuss the origin and evolution tracks of these galaxies .",
    "the surface brightness profiles of the four galaxies in class i are well fitted by the 14  law out to @xmath61 . with bumps at inner few kpc regions .",
    "the disky isophotes at the inner region @xmath62 are consistent with stellar disk formed by infalling gas during merging ; molecular disks of comparable size have been detected in co ( e.g. , downes & solomon 1998 ) .",
    "the fine structures at the outer part of these galaxies hints that the relaxation process is incomplete and is slower than the inner part .",
    "the large position angle changes also hint that these galaxies are merger remnants and are still evolving into ellipticals .",
    "each member of this class has round appearance .",
    "the round appearance suggests that they have experienced multiple mergers , since binary merging tends to produce more elongated objects ( weil & hernquist 1996 ) .",
    "these objects are at the last stage of merging .",
    "the four galaxies in class ii are composed of an inner component described by the 14  law out to @xmath63 plus some outer extension .",
    "the existing outer extension indicates that this class of ulirgs is at intermidiate merging stage and the merger remnant has not relaxed completely . on the other hand",
    ", the outer extension may be from incompletely relaxed material or they can be stars formed in secondary infall from tidally ejected material ( e.g. , barnes 1988 ) .",
    "the five galaxies in class iii show various degress of deviation from the 14 law , indeed is very well fitted by an exponential law .",
    "except , the other four ulirgs are consistent with their being at an early merging stage , both from their morphologies and surface brightness profiles ( see  4.3 ) .",
    "the photometric properties and the optical spectroscopic properties for our ulirgs seem to be correlated .",
    "it is interesting that the percentage of seyfert 1s is very high ( 6/13 ) in our sample compared with complete ulirg samples , such as lawrence et al ( 1999 ) , kim et al ( 1998 ) , which has a percentage of seyfert 1s less than 15% .",
    "all class ii galaxies are seyfert 1 galaxies / qsos while two out of four class i galaxies are seyfert 1/qsos as well .",
    "at least 5 of these 6 seyfert 1s /or qsos are strong or extremely strong feii emitters and most are nls1 like galaxies .",
    "this is very intriguing since our sample is solely selected using the criterion that there should be a single nucleus from hst snapshot images .",
    "in contrast , none of the class iii objects are seyfert 1s and they are classified as either hiis or liners , which suggests that massive starbursts are present in these galaxies .",
    "let us now investigate the evolutionary tracks between these three classes of ulirgs .",
    "morphologically speaking , class i objects are clearly the most relaxed , while class iii objects in general show the most disturbed morphologies and photometries , with class ii objects somewhere in between .",
    "this suggests an evolution sequence from class iii to class ii , and then to class i , as relaxation proceeds to ultimately form a relaxed elliptical galaxy or s0 galaxies , depending on the initial mass ratios of the merging progenitors ( barnes 1998 ) .    in these three classes of galaxies ,",
    "the interplay between star formation and central agn activities is undoubtedly very complex , nevertheless , here we speculate qualitatively on the evolution of these galaxies based on such an interplay .",
    "first , as galaxies begin to interact and merge , massive nuclear starbursts are induced . in the mean time",
    ", some gas also flows into the center to ignite the central agn activities , as indicated by numerical simulations .",
    "the spectroscopic properties of galaxies at this stage are a composite of the central agn and circumnuclear starbursts , with the latter being dominating .",
    "our class iii objects are probably at this stage .",
    "as time goes on , gas continuously fall into the center to fuel more intense central agn activities , while the star formation has subsided due to the gradual depletion of the gas supply .",
    "most of the dust is blown away , as a result , these galaxies are mostly seen as seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "as discussed by xia et al ( 1999 ) , the seyfert 1 galaxy with strong feii emission lines and with steep soft x - ray photon index could be at such a transition stage , namely these objects are emerging young qsos .",
    "our class ii fits this description qualitatively .",
    "finally , as relaxation proceeds even further , gas is mostly consumed by star formation or blown out by superwind ( heckman et al 1990 ) , and the central agn weakens and the merger remnant emerges as a young elliptical galaxy  our class i objects . if the central gas supply is not yet exhausted , then some of these galaxies can also be seyfert 1 galaxies ( as two of our class i objects are ) .",
    "this picture was first pointed out by sanders et al ( 1988a ) ten years ago .",
    "our observations seem to confirm this scenario . along this sequence ,",
    "the gas behavior is also expected to evolve .",
    "there is strong evidence that there are large ( ten kpc scale ) , extended hi or emission - line nebula around some ulirgs ( armus et al 1990 ; hibbard & yun , 1997 ) . the extended gas distribution is formed by the secondary infall of gas thrown out during the merging process .",
    "the infalling gas may form some outer extension of ulirgs , as seen in our class ii objects .",
    "it will be very interesting to obtain hi information to study the evolution of gas in these galaxies ( cf . hibbard & van gorkom 1996 ) .",
    "to conclude , from our analysis of the photometry of ulirgs , we found that these galaxies are excellent laboratories and the surface brightness profile analysis is an important way to study the merging proccess .",
    "the observational data provide a hint that some of these galaxies reside in groups of galaxies and multi - merger is not rare .",
    "six out of these thirteen galaxies are seyfert 1s or qsos , strongly suggesting that the agn phenomenon is universal in the merging process and is an integral part of elliptical galaxy formation .",
    "a number of important works remain to be done . a multi - color campaign of these objects",
    "will provide invaluable information about the star formation sites and the relative importance of starbursts and central nulcear activities .",
    "furthermore , many galaxies ( including a number of small and faint galaxies ) are within the field of the primary ulirgs . whether these galaxies are physically associated with the ulirgs awaits future spectroscopic observations .",
    "such observations will provide insight not only on the environments of ulirgs but also on the nature of dwarf galaxies around these ulirgs .",
