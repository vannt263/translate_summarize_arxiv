    "carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) are very interesting materials for nanoscale electronic devices due to their outstanding mechanical and electrical ( depending on their chirality , cnts can be semiconducting or metallic ) properties .",
    "recently , it was also discovered that cnts have very good thermal properties , as measured experimentally for individual single walled carbon nanotubes@xcite or as estimated by computer simulations ( see the references in section  [ sec : heat_cnt ] ) . at room temperature",
    ", the thermal conductance of carbon nanotubes seems to be dominated by the phononic contribution , even for metallic carbon nanotubes.@xcite    thermal properties are usually investigated using fourier s law . for nonequilibrium steady states where the system is put in contact with two reservoirs at different temperatures ,",
    "there is a net energy flow from the hotter to the colder reservoir .",
    "the heat current density @xmath4 is proportional to the temperature gradient @xmath5 @xmath6 being the thermal conductivity ( a tensor , in general ) .",
    "denoting by @xmath7 the temperature difference between the reservoirs , and by @xmath1 the system size in the direction of the temperature gradient , @xmath8 provided the temperature profile is linear . for usual three dimensional materials , the thermal conductivity does not depend on the system size , and so , it is a well - defined thermodynamical quantity .",
    "the situation is different for one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems , for which the thermal flux is related to the transmission function of phonons from one reservoir to the other . for defect free periodic one - dimensional harmonic systems",
    ", there is no phonon scattering mechanism .",
    "those systems can sustain a current which does not depend on the system s length,@xcite so that @xmath9 is constant .",
    "the thermal conductivity therefore diverges as @xmath1 , and is not well - defined .",
    "in general , one dimensional ( 1d ) systems in which scattering processes can take place should exhibit an intermediate scaling @xmath10 with @xmath11 , in which case the thermal conductivity is again not well - defined .",
    "it is believed that cnts should have a behavior reminiscent of 1d systems , although such claims should be backed up by more systematic studies .",
    "the dependence of the cnt conductivities on the system length should therefore be a major and primary concern in any study of the thermal conductance .",
    "only very few experimental studies on the length dependence of the thermal conductance of carbon nanotubes are available to our knowledge ( see for instance ref .   and ref .  ) , and numerical results are still rare ( see the references in section  [ sec : heat_cnt ] ) . more importantly , fourier s law , which is not valid in general for 1d systems , is sometimes assumed to hold to interpret experimental measurements in order to extract conductivities.@xcite    in order to have a well - defined conductivity , a necessary condition ( which may not be sufficient ) is that some scattering mechanisms can take place , so that the transmission , hence the thermal flux , is reduced .",
    "several scattering mechanisms exist in actual materials , which may be intrinsic , as for inelastic anharmonic phonon - phonon scattering ; or extrinsic , as for elastic phonon scattering with defects .",
    "experimental results showed that cnts of lengths @xmath12 m may exhibit nearly ballistic transport.@xcite this justifies that anharmonic scattering may be neglected if the elastic scattering processes with defects are important .",
    "the most simple defect that can be experimentally controlled is isotope disorder , which amounts here to replacing the usual @xmath13c atom by one its @xmath14c isotope .",
    "cnts with isotope disorder have already been synthetized@xcite and experimental results on boron nitride tubes@xcite showed that isotope disorder could lead to dramatic changes in the thermal conductivity",
    ". moreover , isotopically disordered harmonic systems are also the simplest systems that can be treated exactly with quantum statistics .",
    "there are several methods to compute the thermal conductance of isotopically disordered harmonic systems using quantum statistics ( we therefore disregard molecular dynamics techniques which give only results within the classical framework ) .",
    "these systems exhibit anderson localization,@xcite which arises from an interference effect of different scattering paths , and is thus a manifestation of the ondulatory nature of the phonon vibrations .",
    "the green s function technique is then a very appealing method to compute the thermal conductance in those systems , since it gives the exact transmission , has a computational cost scaling linearly with the system length , and is straightforward to parallelize since transport is coherent .",
    "this allows to reach systems of lengths up to @xmath0 m ( with up to 400,000 atoms ) .",
    "a boltzmann approach , which describes the evolution of the phonon distribution and therefore treats phonons as particles and not as waves , gives only an average description of the phonon flows in the system .",
    "it can not account for the anderson localization of states , and it is therefore unclear whether it can provide a good approximation to the exact transmission .",
    "a boltzmann treatment of the transmission is however very interesting since the method is computationally less expensive ( no averages over the disorder realizations have to be taken , the computational scaling with respect to the cnt index is more favorable , and the inclusion of anharmonic scattering processes is easier than for green s functions ) .    in this paper",
    ", we will address three problems , systematically studying the length dependence of the thermal conductivity with green s function techniques :    a.   does a well - defined conductivity ( independent of the length ) exist for harmonic disordered cnts , or is the thermal transport anomalous ?",
    "the theoretical results on heat transport in 1d chains suggest that the transport is anomalous , but can the asymptotic divergence exponent be estimated , or should incredibly long tubes be considered before such a regime is found ?",
    "b.   how much is the thermal conductance reduced by isotopic disorder ?",
    "how does this decrease depend on the temperature ?",
    "c.   in order to reach even larger systems ( larger diameters and/or lengths ) , a third questions is whether the boltzmann approach to thermal transport a good approximation for cnts _ of experimental lengths _ ?",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present briefly the notations and the numerical method in section  [ sec : formalism ] ( see appendices  [ sec : green_num ] and [ sec : app_boltz_num ] for more precisions ) .",
    "we then turn to isotopically disordered one dimensional chains in section  [ sec : one_dimensional_results ] , in order to test the validity of the boltzmann approach in this simple case .",
    "section  [ sec : flat_cnt_results ] presents our new results on the systematic study of the length dependence of the thermal conductivity for cnts .",
    "a conclusion is presented in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the theoretical and numerical results of heat transport in 1d chains are not always acknowledged in computational studies of thermal conductivities of cnts .",
    "there have been many studies on the ( non ) validity of fourier s law in one dimensional chains .",
    "there are two important review papers on this topic , written either from a mathematical@xcite or a physical@xcite viewpoint .",
    "the main findings to this date may be summarized as follows :    a.   there are chains in which fourier s law can be shown to hold , in the sense that the conductivity does not depend on the system size .",
    "these situations arise when translational symmetry is broken ( through the addition of some on - site potential in an anharmonic system for instance , or when momentum is not conserved by the dynamics , see the discussion in ref .   for more precisions ) , or for specific models such as systems with self - consistent stochastic reservoirs at each lattice sites@xcite ( a model recently studied mathematically in ref .  ) ; b.   there are chains with anomalous conductivities , _",
    "i.e _ depending on the system size @xmath1 .",
    "if the interaction between the particles on the chain depends only on their relative distances ( and no on - site potential is considered , in particular ) , then anomalous heat conduction is generally observed ( @xmath15 diverges as some power - law ) , even with anharmonic interactions and/or mass disorder ( see the references in ref .  ) .",
    "the precise exponent for systems with anharmonic interactions is still a matter of debate , with theoretical results@xcite ranging from @xmath16 to @xmath17 , the most recent numerical results for fermi - pasta - ulam chains giving values closer to @xmath18 ( see ref .  ) ; c.   in some models , the scaling of the conductivity depends on the details of the thermal reservoirs , the way they are coupled to the system , or the boundary conditions used.@xcite    most of these results are found from numerical ( molecular dynamics ) simulations , though sometimes it is possible to prove mathematically the ( non ) existence of an @xmath1-independent conductivity for the model at hand .    more precise results on heat transport in isotopically disordered harmonic lattices ( which is the focus here ) are recalled in section  [ sec : theoretical_heat_harmonic_isotopic ] when presenting numerical results for 1d chains .",
    "the most popular method to compute conductivities is nowadays molecular dynamics ( md ) .",
    "a noticeable exception is the green s function approach to defect scattering of refs .   and  .",
    "sometimes , the boltzmann equation may be used as well .",
    "we now give a brief review of md studies .    within the md framework ,",
    "the most popular approaches for thermal transport are ( i ) equilibrium methods , which rely on the green - kubo formula ; and ( ii ) nonequilibrium steady state ( ness ) methods , where a non - zero heat flux is created in the system , either through boundary forcing ( temperature difference ) or using some mechanical forcing.@xcite although the numerical procedures are by now standard computational methods in molecular dynamics , they are not free from the general limitations and issues concerning the convergence of the simulation results . for instance , it is known that the numerical computation of the conductivity relying on the green - kubo formula requires very long time integrals of the heat current autocorrelation function , and averages over many trajectories starting from different initial conditions .",
    "besides , as the system size increases , the typical correlation time increases as well.@xcite in general , we expect a computational cost scaling as @xmath19 since one force iteration of the md solver requires at least @xmath20 operations , and the typical time ( be it a correlation time in the green - kubo case , or the relaxation time to reach a steady state for ness computations ) is expected to scale as @xmath20 as well .",
    "moreover , to obtain the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity , many simulations should be performed , each one at a different temperature .",
    "critical reviews of md results have been written.@xcite in particular , the upper limit to the conductance given by the thermal ballistic conductance can be computed , and results of md simulations compared to this upper limit.@xcite it is important to notice that md results can not be above the ballistic upper limit to the conductance .",
    "when this is the case , it is likely that md results are not converged . besides , ref",
    ".   showed that in some cases , the simulation results depend on the boundary conditions and on the simulation technique used .    in view of the md computational scalings ,",
    "only short nanotubes are computed ( currently , the computations are usually restricted to system sizes @xmath21  @xmath3 m , whereas experimental lengths are of the order @xmath22  @xmath3 m  however , some md results for @xmath23 m cnts are reported@xcite ) and only few works studied the size dependence of the thermal conductivity for defect free cnts in the framework of classical md.@xcite this amounts to considering only the effect of anharmonicity on the thermal conductance .",
    "the results , in agreement with the predictions of the one - dimensional heat transport theory , confirm the divergence of the conductivity with increasing system sizes .",
    "more recently , the effect of defects and impurities on the thermal conductivity have been investigated .",
    "this includes isotopic disorder@xcite and functionalization.@xcite in those cases , no systematic study of length dependence was performed .",
    "we present in this section two important models of transport : ( i ) the green s function approach , which solves the model in its full atomistic details , and is exact for harmonic systems ; ( ii ) the computationally less expensive but more approximate boltzmann treatment .",
    "both approaches will be used here to compute the decrease of the thermal conductance arising from a disordered region embedded in an otherwise perfect medium .",
    "we remark that the green s function treatment gives the exact transmission for a _ given realization of the mass disorder_. therefore , averages over the disorder realizations have to be performed , unless the transmission function does not vary much from one disorder realization to the other . on the contrary",
    ", the boltzmann approach already gives some average transmission .",
    "coherent thermal transport , presented in a pedagogical fashion in ref .",
    ", involves expressions very similar to the usual expressions for electronic transport.@xcite the reason why green s functions are introduced can be understood by explicitly integrating the equations of motions of the heisenberg operators , projecting out the reservoir degrees of freedom , and turning to fourier variables since only the steady state of the system is of interest .",
    "such a derivation follows the lines of the quantum langevin equation,@xcite and the relationship with the nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) formalism has been precised in ref .  .",
    "rigorous proofs of the existence of the ness can be performed within the @xmath24 scattering formalism.@xcite    the lattice thermal conductance arises from phonons , @xcite which are quantized displacements of harmonic lattices .",
    "we consider an infinitely extended system as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath25 where the infinite dimensional vectors @xmath26 @xmath27 stand respectively for displacements and momenta .",
    "the first index refers to the cell to which the atom belongs , and the second indexes the atom within a cell .",
    "the cell in question can be the periodic unit cell used to generate the system , but it may also be some convenient supercell ( see below ) .",
    "the infinite dimensional matrix @xmath28 is the ( diagonal ) mass matrix of the system : @xmath29 the matrix @xmath30 is the interatomic force constant matrix .",
    "it is assumed to be short ranged in the sequel , so that an atom interacts only with atoms located in a few neighboring unit cells .",
    "changing coordinates to mass weighted coordinates , the transport properties of the system can in fact be completely characterized by the harmonic matrix @xmath31     view of a layered 1d system .",
    "the infinite system is decomposed into three regions : a semi - infinite left lead , a semi - infinite right lead ( which are both assumed to be perfect ) , and a finite central disordered region . assuming here that the atoms in the periodic unit cell interact with atoms located in the three neighboring cells on each side , a fundamental `` supercell '' , called a layer , can be considered .",
    "atoms in such a layer interact only with atoms in the two adjacent layers .",
    ", width=275 ]    we restrict ourselves in this study to a disordered region embedded in a perfect medium ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : system ] ) .",
    "the case of mass disorder is then dealt with by considering the mass of the particles to be randomly distributed . in the most physical case , namely isotopic disorder ,",
    "the probability to have the mass @xmath32 at a given site is @xmath33 , and the probability to have a mass @xmath34 is @xmath35 , where @xmath36 denotes the disorder concentration .",
    "the assumptions on the system imply that the mass matrix is of the general form @xmath37 where in @xmath38 and @xmath39 all the masses are equal to @xmath32 , while in @xmath40 they are randomly distributed .",
    "carbon nanotubes are quasi one dimensional systems , that is , systems of finite size in the transverse directions and ( infinitely ) extended in the remaining direction .",
    "we consider a fundamental supercell ( a layer ) composed of possibly several unit cells .",
    "the number of cells in this fundamental structure is determined by the condition that an atom in a layer interacts only with atoms in the two adjacent layers .",
    "the harmonic matrix therefore has the generic block tridiagonal shape @xmath41 the ( infinite ) subsystems associated with the semi - infinite matrices @xmath42 , @xmath43 represent some reservoirs to which the ( finite ) system @xmath44 is coupled through the interaction terms @xmath45 .",
    "the block tridiagonal structure can be read off the expressions of the matrices ( for simplicity , we assume that there is no mass disorder in the first and the last layer of the central region ) : @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 while @xmath49 in the above expressions , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are @xmath52 real matrices , @xmath53 denoting the number of atoms in a layer .",
    "the matrix @xmath50 represents the interactions within a layer , and the matrices @xmath54 model the interactions with respectively the left and right neighboring layers ( for a matrix @xmath55 , @xmath56 denotes the transpose matrix , while @xmath57 denotes the hermitian conjugate of @xmath55 in the sequel ) .",
    "if @xmath58 is the number of layers composing the disordered region , there are @xmath59 atoms in the central part , and the matrix @xmath44 is of size @xmath60 .",
    "the matrices with underscripts @xmath61 differ from the matrices @xmath62 because of the mass disorder ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : harmonic_matrix])-([eq : mass_matrix_disordered ] ) ) .",
    "the green s function of the whole system is defined as the limit @xmath63 when this limit exists.@xcite in numerical computations , the parameter @xmath64 is a small positive number .",
    "knowledge of the green s function implies the knowledge of the eigenvalues and density of states of the system .",
    "an interesting feature of the green s function formalism in the harmonic case is that the reservoir degrees of freedom can actually be projected out thanks to the linearity of the interactions , so that some effective dynamics only in the region of interest is recovered .",
    "the effective green s function for the central region is @xmath65 where @xmath66 the operators @xmath67 are self - energies , which model the coupling of the system with the contacts . in particular ,",
    "the imaginary part of the self energy is usually associated with some lifetime ( due to phonons flowing out of the central region ) .",
    "this is maybe more easily understood in the quantum langevin framework , where the self energy is the fourier transform of the friction kernel.@xcite    when there are no incoherent scattering processes , the current is given as the superposition of phonons going from the left reservoir to the right one , minus the flow of phonons going from the right reservoir to the left one .",
    "therefore , phonons entering the system can be traced back to the reservoir where they come from and so , the summation is restricted to phonons with positive group velocity for phonons coming out of the left reservoir , and phonons with negative velocities for the ones coming out of the right reservoir . when the reservoirs are at different temperatures ( respectively , @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) , the heat current flowing through the system is@xcite @xmath70 where the transmission factor @xmath71 is @xmath72.\\ ] ] in the above expressions , @xmath73 is related to the imaginary part of the self - energies and the functions @xmath74 are the bose - einstein distributions @xmath75 the expression of the thermal conductance is exact since the system is harmonic .",
    "the practical computation of the transmission is presented in appendix  [ sec : green_num ] .",
    "introducing @xmath76 , the transmission can be rewritten as @xmath77 .",
    "it is therefore nonnegative .",
    "in fact , when there is no disorder , the transmission is ballistic and equal to the number of conducting channels at this pulsation .",
    "in the presence of mass disorder , the transmission is lower than the ballistic transmission .",
    "the thermal conductance associated with the heat current  ( [ eq : heat_current ] ) is obtained in the limit @xmath78 as @xmath79 a remarkable fact about the heat current is that the associated thermal conductance is quantized,@xcite the quanta of thermal conductance being @xmath80 this expression is obtained in the limit @xmath81 for a single acoustic branch in the ballistic regime .",
    "the quantum of thermal conductance has been experimentally measured.@xcite in the sequel , conductances will most often be normalized with respect to the quantum of thermal conductance : @xmath82 the dimensionless quantity @xmath83 is called `` normalized conductance '' in the results presented below .    for 1d systems ,",
    "the thermal conductivity @xmath6 is the thermal conductance divided by the system cross section @xmath84 , and multiplied by the system length @xmath1 : @xmath85 the notion of cross section depends on the system considered and on the conventions used ( see section  [ sec : cnt_model ] for our conventions in the case of cnts ) . from this definition , it is however clear that the existence of a well - defined ( length independent ) non - vanishing thermal conductivity requires a decrease of the thermal current ( or thermal conductance ) as @xmath86 . since the thermal conductivity is not well - defined",
    "_ a priori _ , the thermal conductance is a much better notion to handle .    the practical computation of the thermal conductance using  ( [ eq : thermal_conductance ] ) therefore boils down to computing the transmission factor @xmath71 given by  ( [ eq : transmission ] ) for the whole phonon spectrum ( see appendix  [ sec : green_num ] ) .",
    "boltzmann method is a less expensive but more approximate method than the green s function treatment for the computation of the thermal conductance .",
    "it allows to compute conductivities for very long systems , and therefore to study the length dependence of the conductivity .",
    "for instance , the effect of anharmonicity ( in terms of 3 and 4 phonon scattering processes ) has been considered for tubes of lengths up to @xmath87  m.@xcite recent derivations of the boltzmann equation from microscopic dynamics have been presented in refs .   and   in the so - called kinetic limit ( vanishingly small mass disorder or anharmonicities , long time limit , interatomic spacing going to zero ) .",
    "the proofs are sometimes only formal , the central object in the overall procedure being the wigner distribution of phonons .",
    "the boltzmann equation therefore describes some average behavior of the phonons .",
    "the central object describing this average behavior is the phonon distribution @xmath88 .",
    "the index @xmath89 labels the phonon branch , @xmath90 is the phonon pulsation , while @xmath91 is the position along the system .",
    "the quantity @xmath88 therefore counts the number of phonons of pulsation @xmath90 in the @xmath89-th branch at a point @xmath91 at time @xmath92 .",
    "the evolution of the phonon distribution is governed by the boltzmann equation , which consists of two terms :    * a transport term , which models the free flow of phonons through the harmonic system of reference ; * a collision term , which models the rate at which phonons from one branch are scattered into another branch due to the defects and/or impurities in the actual system .",
    "since we do not consider anharmonic effects in this study but only mass defects , the energy is conserved in the collision processes and the only scattering mechanism is the scattering from a phonon in a given branch to a phonon in another branch _ at the same energy_.      for the system introduced in section  [ sec : desription_layered_general ] , a phonon at a wavevector @xmath93 is an eigenvector of the dynamical matrix of the perfect system : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the lattice parameter ( determined by the length of the periodic unit cell ) and @xmath93 belongs to the first brillouin zone @xmath96 $ ] . more precisely , the @xmath89-th phonon is @xmath97 where @xmath98 is such that @xmath99 notice that since @xmath50 and @xmath51 are real matrices and @xmath100 is a real number , @xmath101 is also a phonon since it is an eigenvector of the dynamical matrix @xmath102 for the pulsation @xmath103 .",

    "the boltzmann equation reads    @xmath115    the left - hand side of the above equation is the transport part of the boltzmann equation .",
