    "one of the most interesting topics in nuclear physics is to study how the nucleon properties change in nuclear medium .",
    "so far , there are many experimental evidences indicating that the properties of the nucleon bound in nuclei are significantly modified from those of a free nucleon .",
    "the famous european muon collaboration ( emc ) effect shows that the nucleon structure functions in nuclei deviate from those in a free nucleon  emc1 .",
    "important evidences for medium modifications also come from recent polarization transfer experiments at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility , which observed a difference in the electromagnetic form factors of a proton bound in a helium nucleus compared to a free one  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "there are numerous theoretical works on the study of in - medium nucleon properties based on various models  prc85,qmf98,npa00,ppnp07 . at present",
    ", we are still far away from describing nucleons and nuclei in terms of quarks and gluons using quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , which is believed to be the fundamental theory of strong interactions .",
    "hence it is highly desirable to build models which could incorporate quark degrees of freedom and respect the established theories based on hadronic degrees of freedom .",
    "the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model proposed by guichon  @xcite can be considered as an extension of the extremely successful theoretical treatment of nuclear many - body systems , known as quantum hadrodynamics  @xcite , to include the internal structure of the nucleon .",
    "the qmc model describes the nuclear system as nonoverlapping mit bags in which the confined quarks interact through the self - consistent exchange of scalar and vector mesons in the mean - field approximation . in the qmc model ,",
    "the quark structure of the nucleon plays a crucial role in the description of nuclear matter and finite nuclei  @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to study the medium modification of nucleon properties in the qmc model where the quark degrees of freedom are incorporated explicitly in the nuclear many - body system  @xcite . in the past decade , the qmc model has been extensively developed and applied with reasonable success to various nuclear phenomena  @xcite .",
    "there are also other models that incorporate quark degrees of freedom in the study of nuclear many - body systems .",
    "the quark mean - field ( qmf ) model  @xcite takes the constituent quark model for the nucleon instead of the mit bag model , where the constituent quarks interact with the meson fields created by other nucleons .",
    "the qmf model has been successfully used for the description of nuclear matter , finite nuclei , and hypernuclei  @xcite .",
    "recently , the qmf model has been extended to a model based on @xmath0 symmetry and scale invariance  @xcite . using the nambu - jona - lasinio model to describe the nucleon as a quark - diquark state",
    ", it is also possible to discuss the stability of nuclear matter based on the qmc idea  @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of these models is their simplicity and self - consistency in taking into account quark degrees of freedom in the study of nuclear many - body systems .    in this paper , we take the nontopological soliton bag model originally proposed by friedberg and lee  @xcite , which is also called friedberg - lee model in the literature , for the description of nucleons in nuclear medium . in the friedberg - lee model ,",
    "the nucleon is described as a bound state of three quarks in a nontopological soliton formed by a scalar field with nonlinear self - interactions .",
    "the friedberg - lee model has the benefits that it is manifestly covariant and it exhibits dynamical bag formation due to the coupling of quarks to the phenomenological scalar field .",
    "furthermore , it includes the mit bag as a special case .",
    "the soliton bag model has been extensively used to study the properties and structure of hadrons in free space  fl82,fl83,lubeck86,lubeck87,fl86,fl90w , fl90,fl92,su05 .",
    "it has also been applied to discuss the medium modification of nucleon properties  prc85,jpg93 and to study the dense matter properties within the wigner - seitz approximation  @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we develop a model to study the properties of nuclear matter and finite nuclei by describing the nuclear many - body system as a collection of nontopological soliton bags .",
    "the quarks inside the soliton bag couple not only to the scalar field that binds the quarks together into nucleons , but also to additional meson fields generated by the nuclear environment .",
    "the nucleons interact through the self - consistent exchange of these mesons treated as classical fields in the spirit of the qmc and qmf models . because in this model the soliton solution",
    "is significantly changed by the additional meson fields , it is possible to investigate the modification of nucleon properties in nuclear medium .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows . in sec .",
