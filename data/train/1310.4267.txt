    "we were thus very pleased to find a _",
    "dessin _ that leads to the collinearity graphs of this geometry , and to its complement  the famous schlfli graph  as well ( fig.[fig12 ] ) . moreover , gq(2,4 ) is also notable by the fact it contains ( altogether 27 ) copies of the clebsch graph , each such copy being the complement of a geometric hyperplane of particular type .",
    "and since the clebsch graph is also a _ dessin_-generated one ( see table2 ) , we will not be surprised if our _ dessin _ s formalism is also found of relevance for getting conceptual insights into the still - mysterious formal link between stringy black hole entropy formulas and properties of multi - qubits ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) .",
    "we have demonstrated , substantially boosting the spirit of @xcite , that grothendieck s _ dessins denfants _ ( `` child s drawings '' )  that is graphs where at each vertex is given a cyclic ordering of the edges meeting it and each vertex is also assigned one of two colors , conventionally black and white , with the two ends of every edge being colored differently  and their associated permutation groups / belyi functions give rise to a wealth of finite geometries relevant for quantum physics .",
    "we have made a complete catalog of these geometries for _ dessins _ featuring up to 12 edges , highlighted distinguished geometries for some higher - index _ dessins _ , and briefly elaborated on quantum physical meaning for each non - trivial geometry encountered .",
    "we are astonished to see that a majority of dessin - generated geometries have already been found to have a firm footing in finite - dimensional quantum mechanical setting , like the k(3,3 ) and petersen graphs , the fano plane , the @xmath170 grid ( mermin s square ) , the desargues configuration , mermin s pentagram and the generalized quadrangles gq(2,2 ) and gq(2,4 ) .",
    "we have also found a wealth of geometries , among them the hesse @xmath192-configuration , the reye @xmath193-configuration @xcite , the @xmath194-grid , the kneser graph @xmath195 and many others , that still await their time to enter the game .",
    "our findings may well be pointing out that properties of _ dessins _ , as well as the galois group @xmath196 acting on them , may be vital for getting deeper insights into foundational aspects of quantum mechanics . to this end in view",
    ", we aim to expand in a systematic way our catalog of finite geometries generated by higher - index dessins in order to reveal finer traits of the quantum pattern outlined above .",
