    "the choice of the continuous double auction was mainly done during the computerization of the financial stock exchanges all over the world , starting in the 1980 s .",
    "such a choice was however not obvious , and another trading mechanism , the periodic call auction , has had its supporters . in a periodic call auction ,",
    "trading orders can be submitted continuously but are filled only periodically , using some clearing mechanism . during the auction time , all submitted orders are stored ( and may be cancelled at any time ) , whatever their submission price is",
    ". then at some pre - determined time the auction is closed , and the cumulative bid and offer are computed as functions of the price .",
    "the clearing price is chosen upon consideration of these functions , following a set of pre - agreed rules that aim at maximizing the trading volume , minimizing the market imbalance , etc .",
    "( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* for examples of clearing rules ) .",
    "once a clearing price is computed , all exchanges are done all at the same time .",
    "proponents of the call auction mechanism argued that the call auction might help reducing trading cost and enhancing price discovery ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the call auction has been used as the main trading mechanism of the arizona stock exchange that has been operational from 1990 to 2001 .",
    "note also that recent trading accidents due to uncontrolled algorithmic trading have raised some new interests for the call auction : its non - continuous periodic trading times may appear as a potential solution against `` flash crashes '' such as the one observed on the nyse on may 6th , 2010 .    as of today",
    ", the call auction is used in different trading procedures , according to rules that often depend on the liquidity of the traded stocks .",
    "for example , the call auction is the main trading mechanism for the least traded equities on the euronext french regulated market .",
    "these stocks are not continuously traded but are actually fully exchanged using call auctions that take place once a day for some stocks , and twice a day for most of them , at 11:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. @xcite .",
    "a better known example is the use of the call auction to determine opening and closing prices for liquid stocks , that are otherwise traded according to a continuous double auction throughout the trading day .",
    "for example , the typical trading day for continuously - traded liquid stocks on the euronext french regulated market is as follows .",
    "the trading day starts with an opening call auction until 9:00 a.m. : all orders submitted before this time are `` automatically recorded in the central order book without giving rise to trades '' .",
    "then at 9:00 a.m. , the clearing of the call auction takes place , which determines the opening price . from 9:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. , trading is done according to the continuous double auction . at 5:30",
    "p.m. starts the closing call auction . during 5 minutes , submitted orders",
    "are again `` automatically recorded in the central order book without giving rise to trades '' . at 5:35 p.m.",
    ", the market is cleared , and this closing auction determines the closing price .",
    "the trading day ends with five minutes of `` trading at last '' in which trades can be made at the closing price ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for more details ) .",
    "despite the wide interest in the call auction , microstructure literature on this mechanism is scarce .",
    "the seminal work in this field is due to @xcite , in which the call auction described here is called a `` clearing house '' mechanism .",
    "these results were later used for a comparison between call auction and continuous double auction by @xcite , and the paper enjoys an increasing trend in citations in recent microstructure papers .",
    "@xcite models a call auction in which buy and sell orders are submitted with size one and a price uniformly distributed on some interval @xmath1 . in the case where buy and sell orders",
    "are assumed to be poisson processes with _ identical _",
    "parameters , the author derives the distribution of the traded volume as well as the first moments of the price distribution . however",
    ", in the general case with potential market imbalance ( i.e. with different processes governing the arrival of buy and sell orders ) , weaker results are only obtained through the use of asymptotic renewal theory results , in the form of second - order expansions of the first and second moments of the traded volume and the price distributions .",
    "the main assumption required for these approximations to be acceptable is that the market must be `` thick '' in mendelson s words , i.e. very liquid .",
    "therefore the results mentionned above are not valid in the case of an illiquid market where the probability that no transaction occurs during a call auction is not negligible .    in this paper",
    ", we provide the complete solution of the call auction described in @xcite , even in the case where this seminal paper stated that such general forms did not exist .",
    "we show that the problem of determining the traded volume and the price distributions is analytically tractable , even in the general case of market imbalance and a general price distribution .",
    "perhaps more importantly , we derive rigorous weak limits of the exact distributions obtained , showing the asymptotic normality of the traded volume and the price distributions as the liquidity increases .",
    "similarly , it is proved that in this setting the clearing price range , a proxy to the post - clearing spread , is asymptotically exponentially distributed .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : preliminaryresults ] , the call auction is described and it is shown that , conditionally on the number of submitted bid and ask orders , the traded volume and price distribution are easily analytically tractable . in section [ sec : tradedvolumedistribution ] , the exact unconditional distribution of the traded volume is derived , as well as its weak limit when the liquidity increases . it is shown that the orders price distribution does not influence this distribution , and that the market imbalance ( ratio between the expected number of bid and ask orders ) has a non trivial influence on the limit distribution . using in particular fundamental results of the theory of order statistics , section [ sec : pricesdistributions ] derives similar results for the distributions of the lower and upper clearing price , and section [ sec : pricerangedistribution ] for the distribution of the range of potential clearing prices .",
    "the scaling constants are again non - trivial and depend on the market imbalance as well as the orders price distribution . as all these results",
    "are derived without any cancellation mechanism , section [ sec : cancellation ] shows that , thanks to a simple substitution in the model parameters , all results can easily be generalized to the case where submitted limit orders are cancelled after an exponentially distributed lifetime .    to our knowledge , all these results are new .",

    "* ) ; @xmath13 denotes the integer part of a real number @xmath14 ; @xmath15 will be used for the definition equality .",
    "finally , all random variables and processes subsequently used in this paper are assumed to be defined on some probability space @xmath16 .",
    "let us consider a standard call auction for the exchange of a given financial product .",
    "ask ( sell ) orders are submitted at random times according to a poisson process with parameter @xmath17 .",

    "the assumption that bid and ask orders are submitted according to the same distribution may seem very basic , but it is the one used by @xcite and it is actually fundamental to the following analysis ( see remark [ rmk : samebuysellpricedistribution ] ) . it is a purely zero - intelligence assumption , where no prior information on the price is incorporated into the model .",
    "note however that we have no restriction on @xmath0 , which consequently can potentially accomodate a wide range of empirical fits . in any case , without further empirical investigations on the placement of order during a call auction",
    ", it should not be discarded , given its analytical potential .",
    "market imbalance , which represents the relative shares of bid and ask submissions , is thus described by the parameter @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the total rate of orders submission . obviously , the market is symmetric when @xmath21 .",
    "the call auction opens ( i.e. starts accepting order submission ) at time @xmath22 and closes at a deterministic time @xmath23 . for the ease of exposition and computation , no cancellation of a submitted trading order",
    "is allowed for the moment , but this restriction will easily be lifted in section [ sec : cancellation ] .",
    "once the call auction is closed , all submitted orders are taken into account and the market is cleared , i.e. a clearing price ( or exchange price , or trading price in the literature ) is decided .",
    "there are several types of rules used in practice to determine the clearing price ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* table 1 ) , most of which start with maximizing the traded volume . for a given clearing price @xmath9 ,",
    "the traded volume is defined as the quantity of shares that can be matched at that price , ans is equal to the minimum of the total ask quantity offered below @xmath9 and the total bid quantity offered above @xmath9 .",
    "there is not necessarily a unique price that maximizes the traded volume , and more rules may be used in practice to determine a unique price . in this study however , one of our main output will be the range of possible clearing prices maximizing the traded volume , and we will not use further rules to determine a unique price .",
    "let us rephrase this description mathematically .",

    "assume now that exactly @xmath53 points among the highest @xmath3 ones @xmath54 are bid orders .",
