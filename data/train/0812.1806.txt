    "the real part of the complex qnm frequencies is determined by the angular velocity at the unstable null geodesic ; the imaginary part is related to the instability timescale of the orbit , a quantity which is seldom considered in geodesic studies , with some noteworthy exceptions ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . furthermore , there is some evidence @xcite that unstable circular orbits could yield information on phenomena occurring at the threshold of black hole formation in the high - energy scattering of black holes , a process of interest in fundamental physics for a variety of reasons @xcite .    in this work",
