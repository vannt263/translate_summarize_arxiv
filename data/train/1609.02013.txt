    "motivated by the theoretical proposal of a universal divergence in the approach of a quantum critical point ( qcp )  @xcite , the grneisen ratio as well as its counterpart , the magnetic grneisen parameter , have been studied for various strongly correlated electron systems in recent years  @xcite .",
    "the grneisen ratio @xmath4 of thermal expansion @xmath5 divided by specific heat @xmath6 is temperature independent , if the entropy @xmath7 can be scaled in the form @xmath8 with single energy scale @xmath9 , for example @xmath10 for a classical phase transition or the fermi temperature for a metal  @xcite . in case of a qcp",
    "there is however no fixed energy scale and as detailed below the grneisen ratio is expected to display a universal divergence .",
    "while the grneisen ratio probes the sensitivity to changes of pressure , in many cases the magnetic field has been used as control parameter .",
    "the magnetic grneisen parameter is defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the magnetization , temperature , heat capacity and entropy , respectively . whenever a qcp is driven by a magnetic field",

    "the table does not include low dimensional spin systems for which the magnetic grneisen parameter has been investigated experimentally and theoretically near field - induced quantum phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "due to perturbing interactions it is often difficult to approach the asymptotic low - temperature power law behavior of @xmath1 for such systems .",
    "the first four entries of the table concern materials with a qcp at finite magnetic field , while in all subsequent cases the critical field is zero .",
    "the paramagnetic heavy fermion metals ceni@xmath30ge@xmath30 and ybco@xmath30zn@xmath31 have been driven towards a zero - field qcp by suitable chemical substitution  @xcite . however , there is a remarkably huge number of undoped materials , for which the critical field is zero within experimental accuracy .",
    "it seems very surprising , that a compound is located accidentally at a qcp without need to fine tune composition , pressure or magnetic field . as we will discuss in this article ,",
    "indeed many of those materials do not display generic ( pressure - sensitive ) quantum criticality and the magnetic grneisen parameter divergence has other origin .",
    "aim of this article is to categorize materials for which a divergence of the magnetic grneisen parameter and temperature over field scaling with zero critical field has been reported . in the following ,",
    "we first discuss field - induced quantum criticality ( section 2 ) and quantum criticality in geometrically frustrated systems ( section 3 ) .",
    "the subsequent section 4 is dedicated to quantum criticality and superconductivity .",
    "section 5 deals with materials that do not show pressure - sensitive quantum criticality but likely some pressure - insensitive strange metal states . in section 6 , divergent behavior of the magnetic grneisen parameter in disordered frustrated magnets , which display spin - glassy effects",
    "is discussed before we draw a conclusion in section 7 .",
    "ybrh@xmath30si@xmath30 is a prototype heavy fermion metal , which displays a field - induced qcp , related to the suppression of very weak antiferromagnetic ordering below @xmath32  mk  @xcite . for fields @xmath33",
    "the magnetic grneisen parameter displays a @xmath34 dependence and the value of the dimensionless constant @xmath35 equals the exponent of the quasiparticle mass divergence as predicted by theory  @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath36 at @xmath37 has shown a crossover near 0.3  k which may be related to competing antiferro- and ferromagnetic fluctuations and challenges the interpretation of the results within the quantum critical regime  @xcite .",
    "field - induced quantum criticality can also result from the suppression of the critical temperature of a first - order metamagnetic transition towards absolute zero temperature  @xcite .",
    "this has been proposed for the bilayer strontium ruthenate sr@xmath38ru@xmath30o@xmath39  @xcite . very recently",
    "a careful study of the magnetic grneisen parameter has revealed that this material actually realizes a more complicated scenario , with two subsequent field - induced qcps ( for the critical fields see table 1 )  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath40 data also allowed to determine scaling regimes associated with both qcps and the phase space where scaling fails due to the interference of both instabilities . the observed scaling exponents are consistent with the itinerant theory for metamagnetic ( @xmath41 ) quantum criticality in @xmath42  @xcite .    for more details on grneisen studies on field- and concentration",

    "of particular interest is a first - order transition between two magnetically ordered phases near 4.8  t. measurements of the magnetic grneisen parameter provide evidence for quantum bicritical behavior associated with this transition  @xcite . as sketched in fig .",
    "1(d ) , a scenario has been proposed , where such a field - induced qcp arises from the suppression of a line of first - order spin - flop transitions towards absolute zero temperature . further enhancing the strength of quantum fluctuations",
    "would then result in a complete suppression of long - range order at zero field and metamagnetic crossover at the field of the original first order transition .",

    "this is accompanied by characteristic temperature over magnetic field scaling ( panel c ) ) which describes the crossover from the quantum critical into the quantum paramagnetic regimes of the phase diagram ( cf . panel ( d ) ) except for temperatures below 0.4  k and fields below 0.4  t. thus , zero - field quantum criticality is avoided by the formation of some yet unknown state at lowest @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",

    "unconventional superconductivity often occurs in the vicinity of competing magnetic states suggesting a relation to quantum criticality . here",
    ", we focus on measurements of the magnetic grneisen parameter in the heavy fermion superconductor cecoin@xmath56 with @xmath57  k and upper critical field of 5 and 12  t for fields along and perpendicular to the tetragonal @xmath46-axis , respectively  @xcite . various transport and thermodynamic properties",

    "extrapolation of this dependence to fields below the upper critical field and towards @xmath45 suggests a zero - field qcp .",
    "this is corroborated by the observation of temperature over field scaling , where the critical field is zero .",
    "for such a zero - field qcp , the scaling function for the free energy has no linear dependence on the control parameter ( which is then just @xmath14 ) , because the latter would yield a spontaneous magnetization  @xcite . as a result of the ( then leading ) quadratic control parameter dependence",
    ", the scaling parameter @xmath59 now contains a factor 2 which is absent for the case of a finite - field qcp  @xcite .    for the scaling ,",
    "only data taken in the normal state could be included .",
    "the observed @xmath60 divergence of @xmath1 for @xmath61  t is incompatible with previous claims of a critical field of 4 to 5  t  @xcite .",

    "we now discuss a couple of materials displaying signatures of zero - field quantum criticality that appears pressure insensitive as sketched in figure 4 .",
    "the main difference to a generic zero - field qcp is that there is no pressure dependence of the critical field , i.e. , no ordered state is found in the immediate vicinity .",
    "because of the insensitivity to pressure , the grneisen ratio does not diverge in this case . as an example , the itinerant helical ferromagnet mnsi shows non - fermi liquid behavior over an extended pressure range from 1.5 to at least 2.5  gpa with no indication of a grneisen ratio divergence  @xcite .    -ybakb@xmath62 ( left panel )  @xcite and ybco@xmath30ge@xmath62 ( right panel )  @xcite . ]    in @xmath63-ybalb@xmath62 , as shown in fig .",
    "5 ( left ) , thermodynamic properties at ambient pressure such as @xmath64 display @xmath65 scaling and indicate a zero field qcp  @xcite .",
    "however , hydrostatic pressure experiments have revealed the onset of long - range ordering only at pressures beyond 2.5  gpa  @xcite .",
    "the electrical resistivity indicates non - fermi liquid behavior at zero pressure , which extends over a large pressure range .",
    "this behavior has been labelled as `` strange metal '' state .",
    "the non - fermi liquid behavior is field sensitive but pressure independent as sketched in fig .",
    "au - al - yb quasicrystal displays a similar @xmath66 scaling and divergent magnetic susceptibility as @xmath63-ybalb@xmath62  @xcite .",
    "we have recently performed thermal expansion measurements .",
    "the expansion coefficient @xmath67 is less divergent than the heat capacity coefficient @xmath47 .",
    "thus there is no divergence in the grneisen ratio , excluding a pressure sensitive qcp in accordance with the scenario of fig",
    ". 4  @xcite .",
    "next we discuss recent results on tetragonal ybco@xmath30ge@xmath62 . in this stoichiometric paramagnetic hf metal the electrical resistivity shows a non - fermi @xmath68 dependence between 0.1 and 1.4  k hinting at nfl behavior , possibly related to quantum criticality  @xcite .",
    "this is corroborated by a logarithmic divergence of the heat capacity coefficient and local spin susceptibility ( from nuclear magnetic and quadrupole resonance ) at elevated temperatures .",
    "we have recently performed a thermodynamic study down to 0.1  k  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the magnetic grneisen parameter diverges upon cooling at low fields , while the heat capacity coefficient @xmath47 saturates below 1  k. although the strong divergence of @xmath69 would suggest ferromagnetic quantum criticality , the latter can be excluded from the heat capacity data .",
    "even more interestingly , @xmath64 shows exactly the same scaling as found previously for @xmath63-ybalb@xmath62 , cf . fig .",
    "5  @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "also this material shows long - range ordering only above 3  gpa .",
    "therefore ybco@xmath30ge@xmath62 may also be described as `` strange metal '' .",
    "another possibility is that a small concentration of paramagnetic impurities which is hardly visible in heat capacity leads to the strong temperature dependence of @xmath64 and thus @xmath36 down to the lowest measured temperature ( but not asymptotic to @xmath24 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the magnetic grneisen parameter divergence would be extrinsic .",
    "however , the simplest description of independent paramagnetic impurities , i.e. , a curie law in the susceptibility and a @xmath70 behavior in heat capacity , arising from the high-@xmath13 tail of a schottky anomaly , yields a temperature independent magnetic grneisen parameter . in any case",
    "the result shows , that divergent behavior of the magnetic grneisen parameter alone is insufficient to claim quantum criticality .",
    "a thermodynamic proof of zero - field ( and pressure sensitive ) quantum criticality requires , that in addition to the magnetic grneisen parameter also the grneisen ratio of thermal expansion to specific heat diverges . for au - al - yb such grneisen ratio divergence is absent  @xcite . for both @xmath63-ybalb@xmath62 and ybco@xmath30ge@xmath62 millikelvin measurements of the thermal expansion coefficient , using capacitive dilatometers , have not yet been possible , due to the lack of sufficiently large single crystals .",

    "the two iridate materials  @xcite listed in table 1 belong to the class of frustrated spin - orbit mott insulators .",
    "hyperkagome na@xmath62ir@xmath38o@xmath71 with effective 1/2 moments on a three - dimensional frustrated lattice has attracted considerable interest after the proposal of spin liquid behavior  @xcite .",
    "it is a spinel oxide ab@xmath30o@xmath62 where the b - sublattice is occupied to 3/4 by ir and 1/4 by na atoms .",
    "na@xmath62ir@xmath38o@xmath71 does not show long - range order down to low temperatures despite a large antiferromagnetic curie weiss temperature of about 650  k. however , the magnetic susceptibility , measured in a low field of 10  mt , has shown a small peak near 6  k , accompanied by hysteresis between warming and cooling  @xcite . a detailed study of the @xmath77na and @xmath78o nuclear magnetic resonance found evidence for disordered magnetic freezing of all ir moments , which sets in below 7  k  @xcite .",
    "the disorder , necessary for spin - glassy behavior , has been related to small local variations of the 3/4 na occupancy of the b - sublattice , inducing a slight local charge disorder .",
    "a power - law behavior , found in the heat capacity below 4  k  @xcite may be related to the free energy landscape typical for spin glasses  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the magnetic grneisen parameter @xmath1 , as shown in the left part of fig .  6 , displays a divergence upon cooling at low magnetic fields and temperature over magnetic field scaling  @xcite .",
    "however , in view of the spin - glass freezing below 7  k , intrinsic zero - field quantum criticality can clearly be excluded .",
    "since the @xmath40 divergence occurs well below 7  k , it is likely related to a small concentration of magnetic moments , which are not yet frozen .",
    "non - interacting paramagnetic impurities can not cause a diverging @xmath1 ( see above ) .",
    "possibly the observed divergence is caused by a small fraction of ir moments which do not freeze below the spin - glass transition .",
    "similar results were also found in the partially diluted honeycomb iridate li@xmath30(ir@xmath79ti@xmath80)o@xmath38  @xcite .",
    "unsubstituted @xmath5-li@xmath30iro@xmath38 displays long - range ordering at 15  k. the latter becomes immediately suppressed by the partial dilution of the ir site with non - magnetic ti atoms and a spin - glassy ground state forms for @xmath81 . the freezing temperature decreases with increasing @xmath82 but persists to ti concentrations up to 55% .",
    "thus , the material realizes a strongly smeared quantum phase transition .",
    "temperature over magnetic field scaling and a divergence of the magnetic grneisen parameter is shown on the right side of fig .",
    "a pressure sensitive qcp can be excluded from the observation of a temperature independent thermal grneisen ratio  @xcite .",
    "thus , the behavior of the magnetic grneisen parameter is again likely related to a small fraction of ir moments that remain unfrozen at low temperatures .",
    "the grneisen analysis provides a powerful thermodynamic tool to identify and characterize quantum criticality  @xcite .",
    "it uses the ( thermal ) grneisen ratio @xmath83 and the magnetic grneisen parameter @xmath84 which can be determined by suitable techniques with high precision down to low temperatures . for field - induced qcps ,",
    "the signatures of the magnetic grneisen parameter are ( i ) a divergence upon decreasing @xmath13 within the quantum critical regime , ( ii ) a sign change upon tuning the field across the critical field @xmath0 and ( iii ) @xmath2 scaling .",
    "various materials for which such behavior was found are summarized in table 1 . among them",
    "seven stoichiometric materials have zero critical field . the determination of @xmath0 relies of course on the extrapolation to @xmath85 , which in case of the superconducting cecoin@xmath56 may be difficult . for the kondo lattice cerhsn  @xcite and the pyrochlore iridate",
    "pr@xmath30ir@xmath30o@xmath39  @xcite zero - field quantum criticality seems to be related to the strong geometrical frustration .    in all other materials with zero critical field listed in table 1 , a generic qcp at @xmath45 can be excluded .",
    "we have discussed a``strange metal '' scenario where zero - field non - fermi liquid behavior appears insensitive of the application of pressure ( cf .",

    "the divergent behavior of @xmath86 or magnetic susceptibility in these materials indicates strong ferromagnetic fluctuations .",

    "for ybco@xmath30ge@xmath62 the importance of paramagnetic impurities has been discussed  @xcite , although non - interacting paramagnetic spins can not give rise to a divergence of @xmath40 .    a third class of materials displaying magnetic grneisen parameter divergence and respective scaling but absence of generic quantum criticality consists of disordered highly frustrated magnets .",
    "these materials display spin - glassy freezing at low temperatures .",
    "the hyperkagome na@xmath62ir@xmath38o@xmath71 is a three - dimensional geometrically frustrated magnet  @xcite for which a frozen spin state below 7  k has been proven by recent nmr experiments  @xcite .",

    "altogether these observations allow the following general conclusion .",
    "thermodynamically , field sensitive quantum criticality requires a divergence of @xmath36 at the critical field upon cooling .",
    "however , a divergence of @xmath40 towards @xmath88 may also be related to a small fraction of moments leading to a pronounced increase of @xmath64 upon cooling in low fields . to experimentally prove pressure sensitive zero - field quantum criticality",

    "<S> at any quantum critical point ( qcp ) with a critical magnetic field @xmath0 , the magnetic grneisen parameter @xmath1 , which equals the adiabatic magnetocaloric effect , is predicted to show characteristic signatures such as a divergence , sign change and @xmath2 scaling . </S>",
    "<S> we categorize thirteen materials , ranging from heavy fermion metals to frustrated magnets , where such experimental signatures have been found . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , seven stoichiometric materials at ambient pressure show @xmath3 . however , additional thermodynamic and magnetic experiments suggest that most of them do not show a zero - field qcp . while the existence of a pressure insensitive `` strange metal '' state is one possibility , for some of the materials @xmath1 seems influenced by impurities or a fraction of moments which are not participating in a frozen state . to unambiguously prove zero - field and pressure sensitive quantum criticality , a @xmath1 divergence is insufficient and also </S>",
