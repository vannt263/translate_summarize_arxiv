    "the prediction of high - energy hard cross sections in qcd perturbation theory has been a puzzling problem in recent years for a number of reasons : the existence of large perturbative leading @xmath4 ( ll ) contributions  @xcite that seem incompatible with a range of experimental data ; the discovery of even larger subleading contributions ( nll ) of opposite sign  @xcite ; and the increasing importance of low-@xmath5 partons at high energies leading asymptotically to a strong - coupling pomeron regime which can at best be modelled but not really predicted  @xcite .    in order to tame the problem of large logarithms with alternating sign several resummation procedures",
    "have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "the renormalisation group improved ( rgi ) approach  @xcite offers a general understanding of the large subleading @xmath4 terms as due to leading @xmath6 collinear contributions which can be extracted on the basis of the perturbative anomalous dimensions . as a result , resummed high - energy exponents have been calculated in a stable way . in a forthcoming paper  @xcite",
    "this resummation approach is extended to the gluon green s function and splitting function so as to provide a fairly complete account of their energy dependence and of its perturbative ( pt ) versus non - perturbative ( np ) aspects .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to summarise the main results of ref .",
    "@xcite and to argue , on this basis , that the rgi approach tames  to a large extent  the problem of the strong - coupling region as well .",
    "this is because the resummation of the ( alternating sign ) large logarithms leads to smaller high - energy exponents ( and diffusion coefficients ) and to a considerable suppression of the non - perturbative pomeron itself in the green function .",
    "furthermore , we find that strong - coupling contributions factorise , as expected , in the collinear limit , and we are able to provide the resummed perturbative splitting function in @xmath0-space .",
    "the basic problem that we consider is the calculation of the ( azimuthally averaged ) gluon green function @xmath7 as a function of the magnitudes of the external gluon transverse momenta @xmath8 .",
    "this is not yet a hard cross section , because we need to incorporate  @xcite the impact factors of the probes  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the green function exhibits most of the physical features of the hard process , if we think of @xmath9 as external ( hard ) scales .",
    "the limits @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) correspond conventionally to the ordered ( anti - ordered ) collinear limit . by definition , in the @xmath12-space conjugate to @xmath13 ( so that @xmath14 ) we set @xmath15^{-1 } ( { { \\boldsymbol k}},{{\\boldsymbol k}}_0 ) \\ , ,   \\\\   \\label{eqggf }   { \\omega}{{\\cal g}_{\\omega}}({{\\boldsymbol k}},{{\\boldsymbol k}}_0 ) & = \\delta^2({{\\boldsymbol k}}-{{\\boldsymbol k}}_0 ) +   \\int d^2 { { \\boldsymbol k } } ' \\ ; { { \\cal k}_{\\omega}}({{\\boldsymbol k}},{{\\boldsymbol k } } ' ) { { \\cal g}_{\\omega}}({{\\boldsymbol k}}',{{\\boldsymbol k}}_0 ) \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is a kernel to be defined , whose @xmath17 limit is related to the bfkl @xmath13-evolution kernel , known at ll and nll levels  @xcite .    the rgi approach is based on the simple observation that , in bfkl iteration , all possible orderings of transverse momenta are to be included , the ordered ( anti - ordered ) sequence @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) showing scaling violations with bjorken variable @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "therefore , if only leading @xmath22 contributions were to be considered , the kernel @xmath23 acting on @xmath24 would be approximately represented by the following eigenvalue function ( in the frozen coupling limit ) @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the one - loop gluon - gluon anomalous dimension and we have introduced the variable @xmath27 conjugate to @xmath22 .",
    "note , in fact , that eq .",
    "( [ ckoform ] ) reduces to the normal dglap evolution  @xcite in @xmath22 ( @xmath28 ) in the two orderings mentioned before , because @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) is represented by @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) at fixed values of @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) in the ordered ( anti - ordered ) momentum region .",

    "a correct treatment of all @xmath52-dependent rg contributions would make the formalism technically more complex ( e.g.requiring a two - channel approach ) and given the observed small effect of the @xmath52 contributions , we feel such an effort to be currently uncalled for",

    "this also guarantees that the momentum sum - rule is satisfied at two - loop level .",
    "note finally that the resummed kernel proposed here differs from that of  @xcite because the collinear terms are added in the @xmath12-dependent form , the difference being at nnll level .",

    "the most striking feature of the ll evolution is its strong dependence on the non - perturbative regularisation , even for rapidities as low as @xmath94 .",
    "the exact value of @xmath85 depends on the regularisation being used , ranging between @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "in contrast , @xmath42evolution remains under perturbative control up to much larger rapidities and the np pomeron behaviour takes over only for @xmath96 , where the three cutoff solutions start to diverge .",
    "regularisation dependence is also present at lower rapidities .",
    "this seems to be due to power corrections to , associated with the use of a coupling @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "the non - perturbative regime of the ir frozen coupling solution is reached only later ( @xmath98 ) , at the point where it starts to grow more rapidly than the cutoff solutions . a final point to note",
    "is renormalisation scale uncertainties of our resummed results are sizeable  of the order of several tens of percent for @xmath99  but seem anyhow quite modest compared to the order(s ) of magnitude difference with ll .",
    "dependence of the ll solution is somewhat smaller than for @xmath42 this may seem surprising , but at larger @xmath13 the ll solution is in the np domain , where non - linearities ( in @xmath55 ) reduce the @xmath47 dependence . ]",
    "the fact that @xmath85 is considerably larger for @xmath42evolution is natural  it is an expected consequence ( see eq . ) of the fact that subleading corrections lower both the pt and np exponents .",
    "what is quite non - trivial however is that at their respective @xmath85 s the @xmath42green s function is an order of magnitude larger than the ll one : the subleading corrections increase the overall amount of bfkl growth remaining within perturbative control .",
    "this is due to a number of factors , among them a strong reduction of the diffusion coefficient ( see below ) .",

    "despite the fact that the characteristic function around @xmath114 is very poorly convergent , it has been argued  @xcite that the green s function may nevertheless show a growth corresponding to an effective positive @xmath82 , due to saddle - points at complex @xmath27 .",
    "indeed , we find  @xcite that for @xmath115 the pure nll green s function is remarkably similar to the @xmath42result and it is stable with respect to @xmath47 variations .",
    "there is a difference in normalisation , which we ascribe to to the ( implicit ) presence of an effective impact factor in the @xmath42solution  @xcite .",
    "it should be kept in mind however that this ` good behaviour ' of the pure nll green s function breaks down when @xmath60 and @xmath65 are substantially different ( for @xmath116 the green s function becomes negative for @xmath117 ) , resulting in the unphysical oscillating behaviour predicted in  @xcite .",
    "green s functions @xmath7 with @xmath118 are very sensitive to , and largely determined by non - perturbative physics associated , in our numerical solutions , with an ir regularisation of the running coupling at some scale @xmath73 .",
    "for example at @xmath119 and @xmath120 , the three cutoff regularisations of the previous section lead to a spread of a factor of @xmath94 in calculations of the green s function , in sharp contrast to the good perturbative control seen in the previous section , for the case @xmath121 .    however , many arguments in the bfkl framework,@xcite , have been given in favour of _ factorisation _ , eq .",
    ", with the small-@xmath0 splitting function @xmath122 being independent of the ir regularisation .",
    "the most dramatic demonstration of factorisation is perhaps in the fact that a numerical extraction of the splitting function from the green s function by deconvolution gives almost identical splitting functions regardless of the regularisation .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f : peff ] , where the solid line and its inner band represent the result of the deconvolution together with the uncertainty resulting from the differences between the three cutoff regularisations .",

    "firstly , at very large-@xmath0 it approaches the normal dglap splitting function .",
    "the momentum sum rule is satisfied to within a few parts in @xmath128 . at moderately small-@xmath0",
    "the splitting function is quite strongly suppressed with respect to the ll result and shows not a power growth , but instead a significant dip ( of about @xmath129 relative to the lo dglap value , for @xmath130 ) .",
    "dips of various sizes and positions have been observed before in  @xcite though ours is significantly shallower than that found in  @xcite at nll order and similar to that found in the @xmath12-expansion  @xcite .",
    "an interesting question concerns the impact of the dip on fits to parton distributions .",
    "calculations in a ( partially ) rgi ll model  @xcite whose effective splitting function also has a dip , suggest that it is not incompatible with the available structure function data .    at very small-@xmath0",
    "one finally sees the bfkl growth of the splitting function .",
    "we recall that the branch cut , present for a fixed coupling , gets broken up into a string of poles , with the rightmost pole located at @xmath110 , to the left of the original branch point ( @xmath82 ) , @xmath131  @xcite .",
    "the origin of this correction is similar to that of the @xmath132 contributions to @xmath89 for cutoff regularisations  @xcite .",

    "[ f : omc ] here is for @xmath111 . ] .",
    "both determinations are substantially below @xmath82 , as expected .",
    "in this letter we have outlined an approach to renormalisation - group improved nll bfkl resummation that is convenient for numerical determination of the high - energy green s functions and splitting functions .",
    "this is an important step on the way to complete rgi nll predictions for high - energy cross sections and small-@xmath0 structure function evolution .",
    "we have discussed several important new results obtained within this approach .",
    "most striking is the increase in the domain in @xmath60 and @xmath13 that becomes perturbatively accessible once one includes subleading corrections .",
    "even the amount of growth ( number of ` e - folds ' ) of the green s function that can be calculated perturbatively increases significantly .",
    "another result concerns the size of preasymptotic effects : for example , for the transverse scale studied in fig .",
    "[ f : manyreg ] , bfkl growth sets in only for rapidities greater than @xmath134 .",
    "hence it is vital to study the full green s function rather than just the high - energy exponents discussed so far in the literature , and to include the physical impact factors  @xcite along the lines suggested in@xcite .    in the collinear region ,",
    "a key result is the practical demonstration of factorisation of the small-@xmath0 green function , and the extraction of the resummed @xmath135 splitting function .",
    "here we obtain the high - energy exponent @xmath110 , but we find that preasymptotic effects are again of fundamental phenomenological importance . as has been observed in an approach without renormalisation - group improvement  @xcite , the main feature in today s accessible @xmath0 range is a small-@xmath0 _ dip _ rather than growth ( our dip is however much shallower ) .",
    "this phenomenon has yet to be fully understood , because several subleading effects are likely to come into play .    on the whole ,",
    "the present work encourages us to trust resummed perturbative calculations for next generation accelerators , and shows that subleading contributions not only decrease high - energy exponents , but provide significant preasymptotic effects .",

    "<S> on the basis of the results of a new renormalisation group improved small-@xmath0 resummation scheme , we argue that the range of validity of perturbative calculations is considerably extended in rapidity with respect to leading log expectations . </S>",
    "<S> we thus provide predictions for the energy dependence of the gluon green function in its perturbative domain and for the resummed splitting function . as in previous analyses , </S>",
    "<S> high - energy exponents are reduced to phenomenologically acceptable values . additionally , interesting preasymptotic effects are observed . in particular , the splitting function shows a shallow dip in the moderate small-@xmath0 region , followed by the expected power increase .    </S>",
