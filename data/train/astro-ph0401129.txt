    "blank - field scuba surveys have uncovered a large population of submillimetre ( submm ; @xmath5  =  3001000  @xmath6 m ) emitting galaxies ( @xmath7  100010000 sources deg@xmath8 at @xmath9  ; e.g. ,  [ 5,12,13,22,27,39 ] ) . the majority of these sources are faint at all other wavelengths , hindering source identification studies . however , due to a considerable amount of intensive multi - wavelength follow - up effort , it is becoming clear that almost all are dust - enshrouded galaxies at @xmath0 ( e.g. ,  [ 17,30,41,47 ] ) . with estimated bolometric luminosities of @xmath10@xmath11 @xmath12 ,",
    "these galaxies outnumber comparably luminous local galaxies by several orders of magnitude .",
    "central to the study of submm galaxies is the physical origin of their extreme luminosities ( i.e. ,  starburst or agn activity ) .",
    "if these sources are shown to be ultra - luminous starburst galaxies then their derived star - formation rates suggest a huge increase in star - formation activity at @xmath0 .",
    "conversely , if these sources are shown to be ultra - luminous agns then they will outnumber comparably luminous optical qsos by @xmath7  12 orders of magnitude .",
    "both of these scenarios provide challenges to models of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "it was initially expected that deep scuba surveys would identify large numbers of high - redshift ultra - luminous starburst galaxies .",
    "however , the first scuba source to be unambiguously identified via optical / near - ir spectroscopy was actually found to contain an obscured agn , probably a balqso ( i.e. ,  the @xmath13 source smmj023990136 ; [ 28,44 ] ) ; subsequent moderately deep _ chandra _",
    "observations showed that this agn is luminous at energies ( @xmath14  erg  s@xmath3 ; [ 11 ] ) .",
    "although clearly containing a powerful agn , sensitive co ( 32 ) observations of smmj023990136 suggested that star formation contributes @xmath7  50% of the total bolometric luminosity [ 25 ] .",
    "the lesson learnt from smmj023990136 is that the identification of an agn at optical / near - ir wavelengths does not necessarily imply that the agn is bolometrically dominant .",
    "extensive optical follow - up observations of other scuba sources have revealed further agns , a few starburst galaxies , and many sources with uncertain classifications ( e.g. ,  [ 17,29,41 ] ) .",
    "although clearly successful in identifying the presence of an agn in some scuba galaxies , optical spectroscopy has a number of limitations for agn identification in all scuba galaxies :    * the large positional uncertainty of scuba sources often makes it challenging to identify an optical counterpart securely .",
    "* a large fraction of the scuba sources with secure optical counterparts are optically faint ( @xmath15 ) , making optical source classification challenging despite success in redshift identification ( e.g. ,  [ 17 ] ) .",
    "* agns do not always show clear agn signatures at optical wavelengths due to dust absorption and dilution by host - galaxy light ( e.g. ,  [ 20 ] ) .",
    "arguably the best discriminator of agn activity is the detection of luminous hard x - ray emission ( i.e. ,  @xmath16  2  kev ) .",
    "hard x - ray emission is relatively insensitive to obscuration ( at least for sources that are compton thin ; i.e. ,  @xmath17  cm@xmath8 ) , and any hard x - ray emission from star formation in the host galaxy is often insignificant when compared to that produced by the agn .",
    "hard x - ray observations can even provide a secure agn identification in sources where the optical signatures and counterparts are weak or even non existent ( e.g. ,  [ 1 ] ) . due to their high - energy x - ray coverage , high x - ray sensitivity , and excellent positional accuracy , the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observatories offer the best opportunities for the x - ray investigation of scuba galaxies .",
    "the first cross - correlation studies of moderately deep x - ray surveys with deep scuba surveys yielded no overlap between the x - ray and submm detected source populations ( @xmath191020% ; [ 24,26,38 ] ) .. this is probably due to the larger areal coverage of the scuba observations .",
    "] this was somewhat contrary to expectations given that some submm galaxies clearly host an agn .",
    "however , in retrospect , considering that the two most obvious agns identified via optical spectroscopy were both detected by _",
    "( i.e. ,  smmj023990134 and smmj023990136 ; [ 11,41 ] ) , agn identification with moderately - deep x - ray observations had not performed any worse than that achieved via optical spectroscopy .",
    "these early studies concluded that a reasonable fraction of bolometrically dominant agns can only be present in the submm galaxy population if they are obscured by compton - thick material .",
    "in this scenario , almost all of the direct emission from the agn is obscured at x - ray wavelengths .",
    "later studies with the chandra deep field - north ( cdf - n ; 1  ms exposure : [ 15 ] , 2  ms exposure : [ 2 ] ) survey showed that a significant fraction of submm galaxies are detected in ultra - deep x - ray observations [ 3,7 ] . in the 2  ms _ chandra _ exposure , seven ( @xmath20% ) bright scuba galaxies ( @xmath21  5  mjy ; s / n@xmath164 ) had an x - ray counterpart in a 70.3 arcmin@xmath22 region centred around the cdf - n aim - point [ 3 ] . and 4@xmath23 search radii , respectively ; the respective probabilities of projected chance associations are @xmath191% and 4% per scuba source . ] at the time of this study , complete scuba observations across the 70.3 arcmin@xmath22 region were not available and only a lower limit on the x - ray - submm fraction could be placed .",
    "the x - ray detected submm galaxy fraction is 54% when the most complete scuba observations of [ 14 ] are used .",
    "figure  1 shows the x - ray detected submm galaxy source density versus flux for the x - ray - submm cross - correlation studies to date .",
    "clearly , the detection of significant numbers of submm galaxies at x - ray energies requires deep or wide - area observations .",
    "for example , @xmath7  15 ( @xmath7  1020% ) scuba sources should have x - ray counterparts in the forthcoming 0.25 deg@xmath22 shades survey ( p.i . j. dunlop ) of the _ xmm - newton _ subaru deep survey ( xmm - sds ) region , even though the x - ray coverage is only moderately deep ( 50100  ks _ xmm - newton _ exposures ; p.i . m. watson ) .    , and",
    "a 5 ( _ chandra _ ) or 20 ( _ xmm - newton _ ) count detection threshold for each x - ray survey ; the flux limits are corrected for gravitational lensing amplification where necessary . ]",
    "on the basis of radio constraints , the expected x - ray luminosity from star formation in bright submm galaxies is @xmath24@xmath25  erg  s@xmath3 [ 3,9 ] .",
    "since it is possible to detect sources of this luminosity out to @xmath26  13 with the 2  ms cdf - n survey , the detection of x - ray emission from a submm galaxy does not necessarily imply that it hosts an agn .",
    "indeed , two of the seven x - ray detected submm galaxies in [ 3 ] have x - ray properties consistent with those expected from star formation activity ( i.e. ,  soft and comparatively low luminosity x - ray emission that is correlated with the radio emission ; see  3.2 in [ 3 ] ) . with x - ray luminosities of",
    ", these would be the most x - ray luminous starburst galaxies known .",
    "the other five x - ray detected submm galaxies have x - ray properties consistent with those of obscured agns [ i.e. ,  hard ( @xmath27 ) , luminous ( ) x - ray emission that is in excess of that expected from star formation ] .",
    "only one of these sources would have been classified as an agn based on its optical properties , underlining the potency of ultra - deep x - ray observations in agn identification . on the basis of these classifications at least 38% of bright ( @xmath21  5  mjy ) scuba galaxies host agns .",
    "interestingly , all of the radio - detected submm galaxies are x - ray detected while relatively few of the radio - undetected submm galaxies are x - ray detected .",
    "this x - ray - radio dichotomy is unlikely to be due to agn activity since in almost all cases the radio emission appears to be dominated by star formation .",
    "possible explanations for the x - ray - radio dichotomy are    1",
    ".   some of the radio - undetected submm galaxies may be spurious .",
    "due to the steep number counts at submm wavelengths most scuba sources are detected at a comparatively low significance .",
    "2 .   the radio emission from the radio - undetected submm galaxies may be extended and therefore `` resolved out '' in the radio observations .",
    "the radio - undetected submm galaxies might contain a cooler dust component , detected at submm wavelengths but corresponding to lower bolometric and radio luminosities when compared to hotter star - formation regions ( e.g. ,  cirrus emission ; [ 13,23 ] ) .",
    "4 .   the radio - undetected submm galaxies may be essentially the same as the radio - detected submm galaxies but lie at higher redshifts .",
    "a combination of these effects might explain the x - ray - radio dichotomy of submm galaxies .",
    "explanation 1 is unlikely to affect significantly the results of [ 3 ] since only scuba sources with s / n@xmath164 were investigated .",
    "explanations 2 and 3 would imply that the radio - undetected submm galaxies are different beasts to the radio - detected submm galaxies and might not typically host agns .",
    "explanation 4 justifies the non detection of the radio - undetected submm galaxies at x - ray and radio wavelengths as due to a lack of sensitivity . under this assumption in particular",
    ", the fraction of bright scuba galaxies hosting agns could be considerably higher than 38% ( i.e. ,  @xmath7  75% if explanation 4 is correct and half of all bright submm galaxies are radio detected ) .",
    "the closest local analogs to scuba galaxies are ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs : @xmath28  10@xmath29 @xmath30 ; [ 37 ] ) . based on spectroscopic classifications ( optical : [ 43 ] , mid - ir : [ 32 ] ) , it has been found that the fraction of ulirgs hosting an agn increases with luminosity [ from @xmath7  25% ( @xmath31   @xmath12 ) to @xmath7  50% ( @xmath28  10@xmath32",
    "@xmath12 ) ] . these agn fractions are generally consistent with that found here for bright scuba galaxies .",
    "power law with differing amounts of absorption ( as shown ) .",
    "this simple figure has limited diagnostic utility ; however , it suggests that almost all of the sources are absorbed .",
    "the sources indicated by an `` x '' are further investigated using x - ray spectral analyses ; see figure  3 . ]    80 counts ) submm galaxies compared to nearby absorbed agns .",
    "the x - ray spectral properties for the nearby absorbed agns consist of the average for a sample of seyfert 2 galaxies ( with @xmath33  cm@xmath8 , open star ; [ 33 ] ) , ngc  6240 adjusted as though it was compton thin ( with @xmath34  cm@xmath8 , open pentagon ) and ngc  6240 ( i.e. ,  compton thick , filled pentagon ; [ 45 ] ) . the x - ray - submm galaxies generally reside in the region found for compton - thin agns . ]",
    "the ultra - deep cdf - n studies showed that a significant fraction of submm galaxies host obscured agns .",
    "as discussed in  2 and  3 , in order to determine if these agns are bolometrically dominant it is crucial to determine if the obscuration toward the agn is compton thick or compton thin .",
    "the most direct discrimination between compton - thick and compton - thin absorption is made with x - ray spectral analyses .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of a compton - thick agn is generally characterised by a large equivalent width iron k@xmath35 emission line ( @xmath36  1  kev ; e.g. ,  [ 8,34 ] ) and a flat or inverted ( @xmath37 ) x - ray spectral slope , due to pure reflection .  0.51.0  kev [ 8 ]",
    ". ] by contrast , the x - ray spectrum of a compton - thin agn is usually well fitted by an absorbed power - law model and a smaller equivalent width iron k@xmath35 emission line ( generally @xmath38  0.10.5  kev ; e.g. ,  [ 8,35 ] ) .",
    "basic x - ray spectral analyses were performed on the five submm galaxies hosting agns in the 2  ms cdf - n study of [ 3 ] .",
    "three of the sources showed the characteristics of compton - thin absorption , one source was likely to be compton thick , and the constraints for the other source were poor .",
    "a comparison of the x - ray - to - submm spectral slopes of these submm galaxies to those of three nearby luminous galaxies ( arp  220 , a starburst galaxy ; ngc  6240 , an obscured agn ; 3c273 , a quasar ) suggested that the agns contributed only a small fraction of the bolometric luminosity ( i.e. ,  a few percent ) .",
    "however , although the study of [ 3 ] provided the tightest x - ray constraints on submm galaxies to date , only one source had a spectroscopic redshift [ the rest of the sources had redshifts determined with the considerably less certain radio - submm photometric redshift technique ( e.g. ,  [ 16 ] ) , restricting more accurate and quantitative conclusions ] .",
    "considerable progress in the optical identification of scuba galaxies has been recently made due to the pioneering deep optical spectroscopic work of [ 17,19 ] . by targeting radio and/or x",
    "- ray detected scuba galaxies , source redshifts for a sizable fraction of the submm galaxy population have now been obtained .",
    "co emission line observations have confirmed that both the redshift and counterpart are correct in many cases ( e.g. ,  [ 36 ] ; r.  genzel et  al .",
    ", these proceedings ) .",
    "the cdf - n field was one of the fields targeted for this intensive spectroscopic follow - up : optical spectroscopic redshifts have been obtained for 24 scuba galaxies in the cdf - n .",
    "the combination of this deep spectroscopic data with the 2  ms cdf - n observations provides powerful constraints on agns in submm galaxies .",
    "in particular , reliable spectroscopic redshifts improve the accuracy of the x - ray spectral analyses through the identification of subtle x - ray spectral features and making comparisons in rest - frame energy bands .",
    "in these analyses we will focus on the @xmath0 sources , which are more typical of the general submm galaxy population [ 17 ] .",
    "fifteen of the 20 @xmath0 submm galaxies have x - ray counterparts : 12 ( @xmath7  75% ) of the 16 @xmath0 radio - detected submm galaxies have x - ray counterparts , continuing the x - ray - radio trend ( see  4 ) .",
    "since some of the x - ray detected submm galaxies do not have enough counts for x - ray spectral analyses , we will first compare their x - ray band ratios [ defined as the ratio of the hard - band ( 28  kev ) to soft - band ( 0.52  kev ) count rate ] to those expected from a simple agn model ; see figure  2 .",
    "this figure has limited diagnostic utility because agns often have more complex spectra than that of power - law emission with differing amounts of absorption ; however , it suggests that few of the sources are unabsorbed .",
    "we have performed more detailed x - ray spectral analyses for the eight submm galaxies with @xmath39 x - ray counts ; the x - ray spectra were extracted following the procedure outlined in [ 10 ] . in figure  3",
    "we compare their fitted rest - frame spectral slopes ( in the 210  kev and 520  kev bands ) to those found for nearby agns with differing amounts of absorption .",
    "although this is still a relatively crude diagnostic , there are distinctions between compton - thin and compton - thick sources . based on this analysis ,",
    "the majority of the sources appear to be heavily obscured but still only compton thin ( i.e. ,  @xmath40  few  @xmath41  cm@xmath8 ) .",
    "we also searched for the presence of iron k@xmath35 emission lines .",
    "the rest - frame equivalent - width constraints are generally quite weak : iron k@xmath35 emission lines are possibly detected in two sources ( with @xmath38  0.7  kev and @xmath38  1.7  kev ) while the other six only have upper limits ( all have @xmath42  1.8  kev and five have @xmath42  1.0  kev ) . from these analyses",
    "it appears unlikely that more than @xmath43  3 of these 8 submm galaxies contain a compton - thick agn .",
    "we can not say much about the individual x - ray properties of the seven x - ray - submm galaxies with @xmath44 x - ray counts ; however , we note that since their band ratios are consistent with the sources for which we have performed x - ray spectral analyses , they probably have similar amounts of absorption ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "ratio corresponds to the average found for starburst galaxies ( e.g. ,  [ 9 ] ) . ]",
    "based on these analyses , the full range of unabsorbed x - ray luminosities is ; see figure  4 .  3 .",
    "] while a number of the sources have x - ray luminosities consistent with those of x - ray luminous starburst galaxies ( i.e. ,  no agns ) , the majority clearly host agns .",
    "the agns generally have x - ray luminosities consistent with those of seyfert galaxies ; however , three could be considered obscured qsos ( i.e. ,   @xmath45  erg  s@xmath3 ) .",
    "we calculated rest - frame far - ir luminosities for all of the sources , following equation 2 in [ 3 ] and assuming the local radio - far - ir correlation .",
    "the comparison of rest - frame far - ir luminosity with unabsorbed x - ray luminosity is shown in figure  4 .",
    "this figure provides an indicator of the agn contribution to the bolometric luminosity . assuming that the far - ir emission from ngc  6240 and 3c273 is dominated by agn activity , the agns in these submm galaxies contribute at most 20% of the bolometric luminosity and more typically a few percent .",
    "if instead we determine the agn bolometric contributions based on the spectral energy distribution of smmj023990136 ( i.e. ,  @xmath7  50% : [ 11,25 ] ; see  2 ) then the agn contributions increase by a factor of @xmath7  2.5 .",
    "clearly , there is a range of x - ray to bolometric luminosity conversions for agns ; however , on average the agns are unlikely to contribute more than @xmath7  1020% of the bolometric luminosity .",
    "hence , although a large fraction of bright scuba galaxies host an agn ( i.e. ,  at least @xmath7  38% ) , in general , star formation is likely to dominate their bolometric output .",
    "an unexpected result in the 2  ms study of [ 3 ] was that two ( @xmath7  30% ) of the seven x - ray detected submm galaxies were individually associated with x - ray pairs .",
    "the small angular separations of these pairs ( @xmath7  23@xmath23 ) correspond to just @xmath7  20  kpc at @xmath46 ( approximately one galactic diameter ) ; the probability of a projected chance association is @xmath191% . from _",
    "hst _ imaging , it has been shown that the majority of scuba sources appear to be galaxies involved in major mergers ( e.g. ,  [ 18,21,29,40 ] ) . at x - ray energies we are presumably witnessing binary agn activity fuelled by galaxy mergers that will ultimately lead to the coalescence of the super - massive black holes .",
    "recent x - ray studies are only just beginning to show the late stages of binary agn activity in agns at much lower redshifts ( e.g. ,  ngc  6240 ; [ 31 ] ) ; however , in this ultra - deep x - ray observation we have good evidence that this is occurring at @xmath47 ! since the smallest linear separation we can resolve with _ chandra _ at @xmath26  2 is @xmath7  10  kpc , many of the other x - ray detected submm galaxies could be binary agns with smaller separations ( e.g. ,  the linear separation of the two agns in ngc  6240 is @xmath7  1  kpc ) .",
    "five ( @xmath7  3% ) of the 193 x - ray sources in this region are close x - ray pairs , showing that binary agn behaviour appears to be closely associated with submm galaxies ( see also [ 42 ] ) .",
    "qualitatively , this picture is consistent with that expected for major merger activity ."
