    "@xcite mn substituting for the divalent cation in zno introduces a mn@xmath0/mn@xmath2 level located in the forbidden gap .",
    "@xcite the mid - gap position of mn@xmath0 has been already practically utilized and powers the research on water splitting .",
    "@xcite mn - doped zno also exhibits a chromatographic effect : the undoped transparent crystals upon doping with mn turn reddish - brown due to the strong absorption interpreted as mn@xmath5 ( mn@xmath6 ) photo - ionization transition ,  @xcite where @xmath7 denotes a photoelectron in the conduction band .",
    "this absorption is accompanied by photoconductivity .",
    "@xcite the nature of this transition has been inferred only indirectly . though the presence of mn in the 2 + charge state in zno was detected with use of electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) ,  @xcite no optical spectra related to intra - center transitions of mn@xmath0 were observed .",
    "since these transitions can occur at energies higher than the observed photo - ionization band , it was concluded that the excited states of mn@xmath0 are degenerate with the conduction band of zno  @xcite , consistent with the midgap position of the mn@xmath0 energy level .",
    "however , no direct evidence of the depopulation of the mn@xmath0 state under illumination was presented so far .    in this paper",
    "we study directly the occupancy of mn@xmath0 ions under illumination by means of photo - epr spectroscopy .",
    "we observe a temperature dependent decrease of the epr signal intensity under excitation with light of energies corresponding to the mn related absorption band .",
    "the kinetics of the epr signal photo - quenching points out to a process involving photocarriers and the mn ions directly .",
    "first principles calculations indicate that the observed photoquenching is due to a transition of mn@xmath2 to a metastable state after photoionization .",
    "metastability of defects and/or dopants typically originates in strong lattice relaxations after the change of the defect charge state . in the case of the as antisite in gaas studied in the past ( the el2 center ) , optical excitation is followed by a large displacement , exceeding 1   , of the defect towards the metastable interstitial site .",
    "@xcite a similar mechanism is operative also in the case of donors , which can acquire the dx configuration when a shallow donor captures an electron and becomes a deep one with a strongly localized electronic state in the band gap ,  @xcite and in the case of native defects ,  @xcite where the ( meta)stability is responsible for quenching of doping efficiency .",
    "a metastable configuration can also consist in a breathing - like displacement of the surrounding host atoms .",
    "@xcite according to the present results , metastability of mn in zno also requires substantial lattice relaxations induced by the change of the charge state .",
    "however , a novel factor that drives metastability of mn@xmath2 is the strong intracenter coulomb coupling between the @xmath4(mn ) states , which prevents the electron capture by mn@xmath2 followed by recombination .",
    "finally , regarding the absorption measurements , the calculations predict that intracenter transitions should occur at energies higher than photoionization , in agreement with experimental data .",

    "the sample was placed in an oxford instruments he gas flow cryostat enabling temperature dependent measurements in the range of 3 - 300  k. the epr experiments were performed at 9.5  ghz , with use of a bruker esp300 spectrometer equipped with oxford instruments esr 900 cryostat operating in the temperature range 1.8 - 300  k. the magnetic field was oriented perpendicular to the @xmath9-axis of the crystal .",
    "the sample was illuminated at right angle to the magnetic field direction with a set of laser diodes of wavelengths varying from 445  nm to 980  nm . for power",
    "dependent measurements a set of gray filters was employed .",
    "the as - grown zno : mn 0.2  % sample is highly resistive , in contrast to the n - type conductivity of undoped zno crystals grown with the same method .",
    "a part of the mn ions occurs in the mn@xmath0 charge state and can be easily detected by epr . annealing",
    "the crystal in hydrogen atmosphere leads to a substantial ( more than fivefold ) increase of the mn@xmath0 ion fraction accompanied by the appearance of n - type conductivity .",
    "figure  [ fig1]a shows the epr spectrum of mn@xmath0 in the as grown zno : mn sample at 3.8  k taken with the magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the @xmath9-axis of the crystal .",
    "the spectrum consists of 30 partly overlapped resonances grouped into 5 sextets .",
    "the five so - called fine structure groups stem from allowed @xmath10 transitions between electronic spin levels of a @xmath11 ion with the electronic spin of @xmath12 .",
    "each group consist of 6 equally intense lines due to hyperfine interaction with the @xmath13 nuclear spin of mn@xmath14 .",
    "the spectrum is characteristic of isolated mn@xmath0 ions in zno .",

    "@xcite    apart from the epr spectrum of isolated mn@xmath0 ions , no other epr signals were detected in our crystals , in particular neither complexes of mn@xmath0 with other defects ( up to second nearest neighbors ) , nor spectra related to mn - mn pairs were observed .",
    "illumination with light in the 980 - 445  nm range leads to a drastic reduction of the detected epr signal intensity of mn@xmath0 .",
    "exemplary spectra recorded at 3.8  k under illumination with 532  nm and 850  nm laser lines are shown in fig .",
    "the laser power was 50 and 660  mw , respectively .",
    "not all of the observed signal reduction can be attributed to a change of mn@xmath0 concentration alone .",
    "the dominant mechanism of the epr intensity quenching shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] comes from the skin effect , _",
    "i.e. _ , absorption by photogenerated free carriers , which reduces the microwave penetration depth and hence the effective volume of the sample .",
    "the skin effect manifests itself in a change of the resonance line shape from gaussian to dysonian , as shown in fig .",
    "in addition , we observe a small shift of the resonance line positions towards higher magnetic fields under illumination . this shift is due to exchange interaction between localized magnetic moments of mn@xmath0 and free carrier spins ,  @xcite an analogue of the knight shift in nuclear magnetic resonance .",
    "both the change of the epr lineshape and the shift of the resonance fields directly prove that illumination with light in the whole wavelength range ( 445 - 980  nm ) studied leads to generation of free carriers .    to eliminate the skin effect the sample",
    "was thinned down to 100  @xmath20 m .",
    "this thickness was found to be sufficient to ensure microwave penetration of the entire sample .",
    "we no longer observed changes of the line shape accompanying the reduction of the mn@xmath0 epr signal intensity upon illumination .",
    "we can also exclude another possible source of intensity decrease in our experiment , _",
    "i.e. _ , sample heating due to incident laser power . since the fine structure @xmath21 ( high field resonances in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) and @xmath22 transitions ( low field resonances ) have the same probability , the difference in the intensities of the high field and low field resonance lines reflects the difference in the thermal population of the -5/2 and 3/2 levels . at low temperatures ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) the intensity of high field resonances is more than twice higher than that of the low field ones . with increasing sample temperature the intensity ratio decreases , and at 300  k",
    "both epr resonances are almost equally intense . even under illumination with 2.4  w at the lowest applied wavelength of 980  nm",
    "we observed no measurable change in the epr signal intensity ratio between the @xmath21 and @xmath22 resonances .",
    "thus , any light induced changes of the epr signal intensity measured in the so prepared sample reflect solely the change in the occupancy of the manganese 2 + charge state .",
    "unless explicitly specified , all further data reported here refer to measurements performed on the thin sample .        the spectral dependence of the mn@xmath0 epr signal photoquenching is presented in fig .  [ fig2]a",
    "depicted is the relative reduction of the epr signal intensity , @xmath23 , under illumination at a constant power of 50  mw .",
    "@xmath23 is defined as the difference between the signal intensities in the dark , @xmath24 , and under illumination , @xmath25 , divided by the dark intensity : @xmath26 for comparison , the room temperature absorption spectra of zno : mn 0.5  % and undoped zno are shown ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b , the onset of the mn - related absorption is close to 620  nm ( 2  ev ) , which is consistent with the optical ( @xmath27  ev ) and thermal ( @xmath28  ev ) ionization energies determined in ref .   for the postulated mn 2 + to 3 + photoionization transition .",
    "the agreement between the spectral dependence of the mn@xmath0 epr signal photoquenching below 600  nm in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a and the absorption shown in fig  [ fig2]b proves unambiguously that the absorption band is indeed due to photoionization of mn@xmath0 .",
    "however , above 600  nm there is a non - vanishing tail in @xmath23 , which we attribute to an indirect quenching mechanism , _",
    "i.e. _ , capture of holes generated in the photoneutralization processes of other defects present in the sample .",
    "although the tail seems to be weak at the excitation power of 50  mw , at high incident powers @xmath23 due to the indirect mechanism is comparable to that observed for direct photoionization of mn@xmath0 .",
    "this means that the concentration of the defects involved is not negligible .",
    "we note that the spectral dependence of @xmath23 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] may not be very accurate , as in the photoquenching experiment different light sources for each wavelength were used .",
    "although the light path was always optimized for the maximum response , there still remains the error connected to the difference in the spot sizes of the laser diodes .",
    "as already mentioned , in the thick zno : mn sample we observe an additional reduction of the mn@xmath0 signal intensity under illumination , related to microwave absorption by free carriers .",
    "this reduction should increase with the concentration of photogenerated carriers as the effective volume penetrated by microwaves decreases .",
    "if the free carriers would originate solely from mn@xmath0 , the spectral dependencies measured in thin and thick samples should scale with the behavior of the mn@xmath0 photoionization band . in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a we show the spectrally dependent quenching of the epr signal intensity of mn@xmath0 measured in the thick sample divided by the quenching measured after the sample was thinned down to 100  @xmath20 m , @xmath23(thick)/@xmath23(thin ) .",
    "the measurements were performed at a constant temperature of 3.8  k. as can be seen , the photoquenching ratio increases with increasing wavelength , in contrast to the behavior expected if mn@xmath0 photoionization would be the only mechanism of free carrier generation .",
    "this result demonstrates that there is at least a second channel of carrier photogeneration , dominant for wavelengths longer than 500  nm .",
    "absorption extending to even longer wavelengths than applied in the photoquenching experiment is also observed in the optical spectrum of zno : mn 0.2  % measured at low temperatures ( 16  k ) shown in fig .  [ fig3]b . the nature and number of the defects responsible for carrier generation can not be determined in our experiment as they give no paramagnetic signal . in the studied samples",

    "temperature dependencies of mn@xmath0 epr signal photoquenching ( @xmath23 ) in the as - grown thin sample ( squares ) and in the same sample after hydrogenation ( triangles ) illuminated with 532  nm light at 50  mw .",
    "the solid lines were calculated assuming a thermally activated recapture process .",
    ", width=313 ]    in contrast to absorption measurements , where the photoionization transition is observed up to room temperature , in the photo - epr experiment photoquenching was found to be temperature dependent , as shown in fig .",
    "this is due to a fundamental difference between the two experiments . whereas in absorption the signal is predominantly proportional to the occupancy of the initial state ( mn@xmath0 ) , in photo - epr the change of the signal is proportional to the transient occupancy of the final state ( mn@xmath29 )",
    "this means that a fast recapture of the ionized electron by mn@xmath2 decreases photoquenching . in other words , photoquenching can only be observed if the occupancy of the final state is metastable .",
    "this can be achieved in two ways : either the photoionized electrons are trapped on other defect centers , or the recapture proceeds via an energy barrier . in both processes",
    "the recapture has a thermally activated character . shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] are the temperature dependencies of @xmath23 in the as - grown sample ( squares ) and the same sample after hydrogenation ( triangles ) illuminated with 532  nm light at 50  mw .",

    "parameter @xmath32 depends on the electron concentration @xmath33 , light intensity @xmath34 , mn@xmath0 absorption cross section @xmath35 , and the temperature independent part of electron capture probability by mn@xmath2 , @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 is the energy barrier for recapture of photoionized electrons .",

    "the upper and lower traces show the change of the signal intensity under 445  nm excitation at a power of 190 and 20  mw , respectively .",
    "the red line is calculated assuming a decay time of 63  ms ( apparatus response time ) .",
    "this decay constant is much too short to account for the kinetics of a process involving charge transfer between mn and other trap centers , which is usually of the order of minutes .",
    "@xcite moreover , the observed decay time does not depend on excitation power , which suggests that the real decay time is shorter than the spectrometer response .",
    "however , at wavelengths above 600  nm there is also a slower component , responsible for a few percent of the signal decrease .",
    "the photo - epr experiments have confirmed that the mn@xmath2/mn@xmath0 level is located at 2.1  ev below the conduction band minimum of zno .",
    "in addition , it was shown that in as grown zno : mn crystals the manganese impurity occurs predominantly in the 3 + charge state . to account for the partial occupancy of the mn@xmath0 state",
    ", there have to be other acceptors centers in the sample which push the fermi level below the impurity level .",
    "one of the candidates is the complex of manganese with interstitial oxygen , mn - o@xmath40 , postulated by gluba and nickel .",
    "@xcite the presence of such an acceptor center , however , is not confirmed in our experiment .",
    "we observe only the recharging of isolated mn ions .",
    "it should be also noted that apart from mn@xmath0 we detect no other epr signals , whether of acceptors nor donors , in our crystals .    in particular , the epr signal of a residual donor with the @xmath41factor of 1.956 , identified as hydrogen related shallow donor ,  @xcite is not observed even after hydrogenation of the sample .",
    "this signal does not appear also under illumination , which suggests that if this donor is present it is not effectively populated , _",
    "i.e. _ , the electron capture rate is much lower than that of mn@xmath2 ions .",
    "it should be also stressed that the temperature dependence of mn@xmath0 photo - quenching is not governed by activation energies typical for zno donors , which range from 35 to about 70  mev .",
    "@xcite instead , activation energies of the order of 1  mev , slightly dependent on sample treatment , are detected .",
    "all these point out to the conclusion that another temperature dependent mechanism must lead to a metastable change of the mn@xmath0 occupancy under illumination .",

    "@xmath46-space summations are performed with a @xmath48 @xmath46-point grid for density of states ( dos ) calculations , while calculations with fixed occupation matrices are performed using the @xmath49 point only .",
    "the @xmath50 terms for @xmath51(zn ) , @xmath52(o ) , and @xmath51(mn ) orbitals are treated as free parameters , whose values are discussed below .",
    "ionic positions are optimized until the forces acting on ions became smaller than 0.02  ev /  .",
    "it was previously shown that both the local density approximation ( lda ) and gga fail to give correct band characteristics of zno .",
    "in particular , the band gap , @xmath53 , of zno calculated within lda / gga  @xcite is about 1  ev .",
    "this is due to the universal `` band gap problem '' , _",
    "i.e. _ , the underestimation of the gap within lda / gga on the one hand , but also to the too high calculated energies of the @xmath4(zn)-derived bands  @xcite on the other hand .",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath50(zn ) term  @xcite solves this problem only partially , since the band gap is still underestimated by about 2  ev .",
    "for example , we find that when @xmath50(zn)=10  ev is employed the @xmath4(zn ) band is at about 8  ev below the valence band maximum ( vbm ) , in agreement with experiment ,  @xcite but @xmath54  ev is still wrong .",
    "this is because the coupling between @xmath4(zn ) and vbm is weak due to the large energy difference between those states , and thus @xmath53 is not sensitive to the energy of the @xmath4(zn ) band . to obtain a correct value of @xmath53",
    "one should observe that the upper valence band is derived from @xmath8(o ) orbitals . indeed",
    ", the inclusion of the @xmath50(o ) term for the @xmath8(o ) orbitals , in addition to @xmath50(zn ) , gives a correct band structure .",
    "@xcite we find that @xmath50(zn)=12.5  ev and @xmath50(o)=6.25  ev reproduce both the experimental @xmath53 of 3.3  ev  @xcite and the energy of the @xmath4(zn ) band , centered about 8  ev below the vbm , in excellent agreement with ref .  .",
    "these values also lead to the correct width of @xmath55  ev of the upper valence band of mostly @xmath52(o ) character , and the lower conduction band of @xmath56(zn ) character .",

    "moreover , the barrier @xmath37 depends on the @xmath50(mn ) term : it decreases with the increasing @xmath50 and it vanishes for @xmath50(mn ) higher than about 1.7  ev .",
    "the decrease of @xmath37 is related with the @xmath50-induced decrease of the mn levels . in particular , for @xmath96 the @xmath62 level is degenerate with the conduction band for the configuration @xmath67 , while for @xmath97  ev it is below the cbm , and therefore a direct transition of the photoelectron from the conduction band to @xmath62 is possible .",

    "photo - epr experiments performed on zno : mn single crystals have confirmed that the mn@xmath2/mn@xmath0 level is located about 2.1  ev below the conduction band minimum of zno , as illumination of the crystal with photon energies higher than 2.1  ev leads to a partial , temperature dependent depopulation of the mn@xmath0 state at low temperatures , accompanied by photoconductivity . the unusually small thermal deactivation energy ( of the order of 1  mev ) together with the untypically fast kinetics of mn@xmath0 photoquenching point out to a process different from charge transfer from mn@xmath0 to other defect centers . we interpret the observed metastable change of mn@xmath0 occupancy under illumination as due to a small energy barrier for electron recapture from the conduction band by mn@xmath2 .",
    "gga+@xmath50 approach was employed to study both the mn@xmath0 - mn@xmath2 optical transitions , and the stability of the ( mn@xmath2 , @xmath7 ) photoexcited state .",
    "the excited state is found to be metastable , because in the relaxed configuration a direct recombination of the photoelectron is not possible , and recapture requires overcoming an energy barrier .",
    "the energy barrier @xmath37 decreases with the incrasing @xmath50(mn ) , and vanishes for @xmath97  ev . comparing theory with experiment",
    "we find that @xmath50(mn ) of about 1.5  ev leads to photoionization energy , 2.4  ev , and the barrier @xmath37 of the order 1 mev , in a reasonable agreement with the experimental data .",
    "moreover , one should note that similar results hold for mn and fe ions in gan ,  @xcite for which the experimental intra - center transition energies are reproduced with very small @xmath50 terms .",
    "the metastability of ( mn@xmath2 , @xmath7 ) is related with the reduction of the mn - o bonds after the mn@xmath0 ionization .",
    "this change of atomic configuration is coupled to electronic degrees of freedom , and it rises the energy of the d(mn ) donor level .",
    "more importantly , the coulomb repulsion between the @xmath4(mn ) electrons is strong , and it rises the mn level energy by @xmath98  ev when mn changes its charge state to mn@xmath0 . in more detail , while the donor level of mn@xmath2 is situated below the bottom of the conduction band , after capturing the photoelectron the occupied donor level of mn@xmath0 would be above the empty conduction band , which is an unstable electronic configuration .",
    "this factor blocks the recombination of the photoelectron , and drives the metastability of mn@xmath2 .",
