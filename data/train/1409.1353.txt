    "quantum dynamic interactions involving a quantum system with a few energy levels and one or more near - resonant modes of the quantized photonic field have been extensively studied by means of various models .",

    "the so called jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model @xcite , which describes a two - level system coupled to a quantum harmonic oscillator ( e.g. , a single radiation mode ) has many applications in various branches of contemporary physics ranging from quantum optics / informatics @xcite to condensed matter physics @xcite .    with the three - state quantum system , depending on the levels linkages",
    ", one can enrich the conventional jc model including new effects connected with the quantum interference effects .",
    "with respect to simple two - level systems , in the three - level system an extra level can be used for effective manipulation of remaining two levels or so called qubits . otherwise , three - state quantum system as a whole can be used as a unit for storing quantum information . in the latter case as a unit of quantum information stands for qutrit , which has several specific features providing significant improvements over qubits for several quantum protocols @xcite .",
    "the various cases of three - state atoms coupled to a quantized field have been treated by many authors ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the considered linkages are the ladder ( @xmath1 ) , the vee ( @xmath2 ) , and the lambda ( @xmath3 ) . as has been shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , there is another three - state configuration -one can refer it as a @xmath4 configuration , where multiphoton transitions in the quantum dynamics of the system subjected to a classical radiation field are very effective compared to the @xmath5 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 configurations . in this case lower level is coupled to an upper level which in turn is coupled to an adjacent level .",
    "if the energies of excited states in @xmath4 configuration are enough close to each other then by the unitary transformation the problem can be reduced to the polar-@xmath2 configuration , i.e. with permanent dipole moments in the excited stationary states . in this context as a known example one can mention the hydrogen atom in spheric and parabolic @xcite coordinates .",
    "the inverse with respect to the @xmath4 configuration is the @xmath6 configuration , which is unitary equivalent to the polar-@xmath0 configuration ( see below ) .",
    "thus , it is of interest to study the interaction of @xmath7-type ( or @xmath4-type ) atom with single - mode quantized radiation field , where new multiphoton effects are expected .",
    "thanks to recent achievements in cavity / circuit quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xcite one can achieve interaction - dominated regimes in which multiphoton effects are expected . the key parameter to characterize cavity / circuit quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) setups is the vacuum rabi frequency , which is the strength of the coupling between the light and matter .",
    "depending on the magnitude of the vacuum rabi frequency cavity / circuit qed can be divided into four coupling regimes : weak , strong , ultrastrong , and deep strong . for the weak coupling ,",
    "the atom - photon interaction rate is smaller than the atomic and cavity field decay rates . in this case",
    "one can manipulate by the spontaneous emission rate compared with its vacuum level by tuning discrete cavity modes @xcite . in the strong coupling regime ,",
    "when the emitter  photon interaction becomes larger than the combined decay rate , instead of the irreversible spontaneous emission process coherent periodic energy exchange between the emitter and the photon field in the form of rabi oscillations takes place @xcite . in the ultrastrong coupling regime , the emitter ",
    "photon coupling strength is comparable to appreciable fractions of the oscillator frequency @xcite . in this regime",
    "new nonlinear @xcite and multiphoton @xcite phenomena are visible that are not present in the weak or strong coupling regimes . if the emitter  photon coupling strength is increased even further it becomes larger than the oscillator frequency .",
    "this regime , usually referred to as deep strong coupling regime , opens up new possibilities for matter ",
    "photon manipulations in the quantum level @xcite .",
    "the main candidate for achieving deep strong coupling regime is the circuit qed setups @xcite where one can realize artificial atoms with desired configuration @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of these atoms over natural ones is the additional control associated with the tunability of almost all parameters .",
    "in particular , one can realize three - state @xmath8-atom @xcite , opening possibilities for many quantum optics phenomena with superconducting circuits .",
    "in the present paper we consider a quantum system composed of a three - level artificial atom ( qutrit ) and a single - mode photonic field , i.e. harmonic oscillator , in the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes.we assume a qutrit to be in a polar-@xmath0 configuration in which two lower levels have mean dipole moments .",

    "let us consider a three - state quantum system or so called qutrit interacting with the single - mode radiation field of frequency @xmath9 .",

    "the polar-@xmath0  configuration is unitary equivalent to a @xmath7  configuration .",
    "a more in - depth discussion of this point can be found in appendix  [ sec : l ] .",
    "the mentioned qutrit configuration can be realized for example in the symmetric double well potential .",
    "the latter is a frequently appearing structure in the solid - state semiconductor or superconductor systems @xcite . in particular , the effective potential landscape is reduced to a double - well potential for superconducting quantum interference device loop @xcite and three - josephson junction loop three .    here",
    "we assume coupling to a bosonic field with the transition selection rules equivalent the ones for the electric - dipole transitions in usual atoms .",
