    "ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are extra - nuclear point x - ray sources with luminosities exceeding the eddington limit for a @xmath13 black hole ( bh ) .",
    "the most popular model to explain the high luminosities of ulx is the `` intermediate mass bh '' with mass @xmath14 ( e.g. , colbert & mushotzky 1999 ) .",
    "other popular models include x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) with anisotropic emission ( king et al .",
    "2001 ) , beamed xrbs with relativistic jets directly pointing towards us i. e. , scaled down versions of blazars ( mirabel & rodriguez 1999 ) , and xrbs with super - eddington accretion rates ( begelman 2002 ) .",
    "there is now extensive study of x - ray spectra of ulxs with _ xmm - newton _ & _ chandra_. ulxs show a variety of spectral shapes : ( @xmath15 ) simple power law similar to the low / hard state of bh xrbs ( winter , mushotzky & reynolds 2005 ) , ( @xmath16 ) disk blackbody ( @xmath17 ) plus power law similar to the high / soft state of bh xrbs ( see e.g. , feng & kaaret 2005 ) , ( @xmath18 ) strongly curved spectra at high energies ( stobbart , roberts & warwick 2004 ; feng & kaaret 2005 ; agrawal & misra 2006 ; dewangan , griffiths & rao 2006a ; stobbart , roberts & wilms 2006 ) without a corresponding spectral state in bh xrbs .",
    "these spectra are physically well described by a cool disk and thermal comptonization in an optical thick corona .",
    "the cool disk plus power - law spectra of ulxs may not always correspond to the high / soft state of bh xrbs ( see roberts et al .",
    "2005 ; dewangan et al .",
    "the detailed variability properties of ulxs are yet to be known .",
    "it is important to study both the spectral and temporal characteristics of ulxs to understand their nature .",
    "bh xrbs exhibit characteristic power density spectra ( pds ) depending on their x - ray spectral state ( mcclintock & remillard 2003 ) .",
    "many bh xrbs show quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) and breaks in their pds that represent characteristic timescales close to the bh .",
    "these characteristic frequencies scale with the mass of the bh .",
    "therefore , determination of the shape of the pds and the detection of qpos is crucial to understand the nature of ulxs . to date , there is only one ulx , m  82 x-1 , that is known to show qpos ( strohmayer & mushotzky 2003 ; fiorito & titarchuk 2004 ; dewangan , titarchuk & griffiths 2006b ; mucciarelli et al .",
    "2006 ) .    in this _",
    "letter _ , we report the discovery of a @xmath0 qpo from the bright ulx holmberg ix x-1 ( hereafter ho  ix x-1 ; also known as m81 x-9 ) based on a long _ xmm - newton _ observation .",
    "the ulx is located in the dwarf irregular galaxy holmberg ix , a companion to m  81 .",
    "the position of the ulx is @xmath19 away from the optical center of the host galaxy .",
    "ho  ix x-1 is a bright x - ray source ( @xmath20 ) that is variable on time scales of weeks and months ( la parola et al . 2001 ) .",
    "miller , fabian & miller ( 2004 ) presented x - ray spectra of ho  ix  x-1 based on two snapshot _ xmm - newton _ observations .",
    "the spectra were modeled by a cool ( @xmath21 ) disk emission and simple power - law components .",
    "miller et al .",
    "( 2004 ) suggested a bh mass of @xmath22 by scaling the disk temperatures measured in ho  ix  x-1 to those usually observed in bh xrbs in their high state .",

    "_ xmm - newton _ observed holmberg ix on 2004 september 26 for @xmath23 .",
    "the epic pn and mos cameras were operated in the large window and the full frame modes , respectively , using the thin filter .",
    "we used sas version 6.5.0 and the most recent calibration database to process and filter the event data .",
    "examination of the background rate above @xmath24 showed that the observation is completely swamped by the particle background after an elapsed time of @xmath25 and this latter period was therefore excluded from the rest of the analysis . for temporal analysis , we used all the pn and mos events with patterns @xmath26 and a continuous exposure of @xmath27 during which both the pn and mos cameras operated simultaneously . for spectral analysis , we chose a count rate cut - off criterion to exclude the high particle background and used event patterns @xmath28 ( singles and doubles ) and flag=0 .",
    "we extracted events from the pn and mos cameras using a @xmath29 circular region centered at the peak position of the ulx ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ; la parola et al .",
    "we also extracted appropriate background events within nearby circular regions free of sources .",
    "for temporal analysis , we combined the pn and mos data to increase the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we calculated a power density spectrum ( pds ) using the background corrected pn+mos light curves sampled at @xmath32 .",
    "figure  [ f1 ] shows the @xmath4 pds of ho  ix  x-1 rebinned by a factor of @xmath33 yielding a frequency resolution of @xmath34 .",

    "the white noise continuum above @xmath36 is not shown in fig .",
    "there is a prominent qpo with its peak frequency near @xmath0 .",
    "to fit the pds , we used a simple power law for the continuum , a lorentzian to describe the qpo and a constant to account for the white noise .",

    "bh xrbs show flat - topped , band - limited noise in their low state ( ls ) .",
    "the flat - topped noise weakens in the intermediate / very high states ( is / vhs ) and is absent in the high state ( hs ) .",

    "these are called type c qpos ( casella et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the qpo in ho  ix  x-1 ( as well as in m82  x-1 ) have properties similar to the type c qpos and suggest that the variability properties of these ulxs are likely to be similar to that of bh xrbs in their hims .",
    "x - ray spectrum of ho ix x-1 is curved at high energy ( @xmath156 ) and shows a soft x - ray excess emission at low energies @xmath157 .",
    "the pn spectrum is well described by an mcd ( @xmath158 ) and a cut - off power law ( @xmath9 ; @xmath159 ) or a comptt component ( @xmath160 ; @xmath161 and @xmath162 ) . while this form of unusual x - ray spectrum is common among bright ulxs ( stobbart et al .",
    "2006 ) , there is no corresponding spectral states of bh xrbs .",
    "both the presence of the qpo and the high energy curvature in the x - ray emission from ho  ix  x-1 are inconsistent with the ulx being in the high / soft state and the soft x - ray excess emission can not be interpreted as the optically thick emission from a disk extending down to the last stable orbit .",
    "thus the temperature of the soft excess component can not be used to estimate the bh mass for ho ix x-1 .    in bh",
    "xrbs , qpos are observed when both the disk and power - law components contribute significantly to the total x - ray emission ( e.g. , sobczak et al .",
    "when strong qpos are seen in the ls , is and vhs , the temperature of the disk component is cooler than that in the hs . in these cases ,",
    "the inner disk is thought to be truncated ( done & kubota 2005 ) .",
    "the presence of the strong qpo in the power spectrum of ho ix x-1 , then , implies that its accretion disk must be truncated at some inner radius , larger than the radius of the innermost stable orbit .",
    "done & kubota ( 2005 ) have investigated accretion disk structure of bh xrbs in their vhs characterized by strongly comptonized spectra and cooler disk temperatures compared to that in the hs . they have proposed a model in which the corona and the disk are parts of the same accretion flow . at high accretion rates ,",
    "the inner corona is energetically - coupled to an outer disk that is truncated at some inner radius , thus resulting in a cooler disk and optically thick inner corona .",
    "ulxs with cool soft x - ray emission and high energy curvature such as ho ix x-1 may be the extreme cases of vhs of bh xrbs .",
    "in ho  ix  x-1 , the disk truncation radius is likely to be larger and the inner corona is optically thicker compared to that in the vhs of bh xrbs .",
    "thus ho ix x-1 may be accreting at a rate ( relative to the eddington rate ) larger than that in the vhs of bh xrbs .",
    "interestingly , some bh xrbs e.g. , grs  1915 + 105 show spectral curvature around @xmath163 in their hims ( vadawale et al . 2001",
    "; kubota & done 2004 ) . due to the presence of a strong qpo and spectral curvature at @xmath164 in ulxs , ho  ix x-1 and m  82 x-1 , similar to the type - c qpo and high energy curvature at @xmath165 in the hims of some bh xrbs",
    ", it is quite conceivable that ulxs have their spectral curvature at lower energies in their hims .",
    "if the association of the observed qpo in ulxs to type - c qpo of bh xrbs is correct , it gives a useful handle to constrain the mass of the bh in ho  ix  x-1 . in the hims states ,",
    "the accretion rate is typically @xmath166 of the eddington luminsoity .",
    "considering the fact that qpos are associated with accretion discs ( and hence ruling out the possibility of beamed jet emission for the observed x - ray emission ) , this puts a strong upper limit of 400 m@xmath167 for the mass of the bh in ho  ix  x-1 .",
    "further , the spectral curvatures in grs 1915 + 105 are preferentially seen just before radio flares and the qpo frequencies during such states are in the range of @xmath168 ( vadawale et al .",
    "if we equate this frequecy range to the observed qpo in ho ix x-1 , we get an estimate for the bh mass in ho ix x-1 as @xmath169 .    associating the observed qpo in ho  ix  x-1",
    "to type c qpo in bh xrbs has another interesting consequence .",
    "it is observed that transition from hims to soft state ( or sims ) gives rise to fast relativistic jet in galactic sources .",
    "similarly , such ultra - luminous jets should be seen in ulxs , when they make a transition from hims to sims .",
    "detecting such relativistic jets in ulxs will put the association with the bh xrbs on a firm footing .",
