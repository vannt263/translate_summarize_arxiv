    "it is well - known that the jones polynomial of a knot is related to the tutte polynomial of a special graph obtained from a regular projection of the knot @xcite .",
    "it should be noted however , that tutte s original polynomial  @xcite is most easily related to an _ alternating _ knot .",
    "if we want to compute the jones polynomial of a non - alternating knot , we need to use a signed generalization of the tutte polynomial , such as the one introduced by kauffman  @xcite .",
    "tutte defined his polynomial  @xcite in terms of counting _ activities _ with respect to a specific labelling of the graph , and his main result is showing that the polynomial he introduced is independent of the labelling , thus truly an invariant of the graph . this definition and result may be easily generalized to matroids .",
    "the greatest challenge in generalizing tutte s polynomial to signed graphs or matroids is to preserve the independence of the labelling .",
    "this challenge is typically met by considering the tutte polynomial of a signed graph as an element of a polynomial ring modulo certain relations between the variables .",
    "the most general result in the area is due to bollobs and riordan  @xcite who give a necessary and sufficient set of relations modulo which a tutte polynomial of a signed graph is labelling independent .",
    "in particular , kauffman s tutte polynomial for signed graphs is a homomorphic image of the most general tutte polynomial introduced by bollobs and riordan .",
    "our main result consists of generalizing the known formulas for the tutte polynomial of the tensor product of two matroids to signed graphs and matroids .",
    "the tensor product of matroids was introduced by brylawski  @xcite who also expressed the tutte polynomial of a tensor product in terms of the tutte polynomials of the original graphs  @xcite .",
    "this result allowed jaeger , vertigan and welsh  @xcite to express the jones polynomials of some alternating knots .",
    "our signed generalization allows us to compute the jones polynomials of some similarly complex knots that do not need to be alternating .    in the preliminaries we review the bollobs - riordan definition of a signed tutte polynomial , using a notation that is closer to kauffman s paper  @xcite .",
    "we introduce a signed tutte polynomial in a factor ring that is a proper homomorphic image of the most general signed tutte polynomial but , using a corollary from  @xcite and a result from the theory of determinantal rings , we observe that the signed tutte polynomial we propose is a most general possible , if we consider only factor rings that are integral domains .",
    "in particular , our proposed signed tutte polynomial still allows us to compute kauffman s signed tutte polynomial and later the jones polynomial of an associated knot .",
    "we introduce our definition of a signed tensor product of signed graphs in section  [ s_tp ] .",
    "since our aim is to apply this notion to graphs associated to knots , our terminology implies considering connected graphs only .",
    "however , our definitions , statements and proofs may be generalized without any substantial change to signed matroids , very much by the same reasons as the ones observed in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 3 ) .",
    "in section  [ s_tcl ] we generalize two polynomials associated to a graph with a distinguished edge , used by jaeger , vertigan and welsh  @xcite in their formula for the unsigned tensor product .",
    "these polynomials are defined by a system of equations in  @xcite , we define their generalizations in terms of ( labelling dependent ) `` activities '' in the spirit of tutte s paper  @xcite , and then show that our polynomials satisfy a system of equations generalizing the defining equations of  @xcite . the fact that these polynomials we introduce are labelling independent follows from the equations having a unique solution in an integral domain .",
    "this section is the reason why we work with a most general integral domain but not the most general ring in which a tutte polynomial of signed graphs may be defined .",
    "our main result is in section  [ s_tst ] .",
    "we provide an explicit substitution rule expressing the tutte polynomial of a signed tensor product of signed graphs in terms of the tutte polynomials of the original graphs . after showing that the proposed substitution induces an endomorphism of the ring to which our tutte polynomials belong , it is sufficient to verify our rule for one specific set of representatives , associated to one specific labelling of the edges .",
    "the proof then becomes a classic enumeration of `` activities '' the way , we believe , tutte would have proved this result .",
    "our proof may also be applied to unsigned graphs , and is perhaps more accessible to a non - expert than the known proofs of the tensor product formulas for unsigned graphs and matroids .",
    "our study is partly motivated by applications of knot theory to physical and biological sciences in recent years , where there is a need to distinguish different knots and measure the complexity of knots .",
    "one common measure of knot complexity is the crossing number of a knot , which is defined as the minimum number of crossings over all possible regular projections of all possible space realizations of the given knot .",
    "a remarkable result derived from the jones polynomial states that if a knot has a reduced alternating projection ( i.e. the knot is an alternating knot ) , then the crossing number of the knot is equal to the number of crossings in this reduced alternating projection @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for non - alternating knots , one can also use the jones polynomial to approximate their crossing numbers since it is known that the span ( or breadth ) of the jones polynomial of a knot bounds the crossing number of the knot from below .",
    "unfortunately , the computation of the jones polynomial of a knot is known to be np - hard @xcite .",
    "this prevents the computation of the jones polynomial of knots with large crossing numbers in general .",
    "for example , _ knotscape _ , a commonly used software ( developed by hoste and thistlethwaite @xcite ) for computing various knot invariants , handles knot diagrams up to about 50 crossings only .",
    "for some ( non - alternating ) knots constructed using the tensor products of signed graphs , it is possible to compute the tutte polynomials of their corresponding graph tensor products easily , leading to a quicker computation of their jones polynomials , hence a better understanding of such knots .",
    "some such examples are provided in section  [ s_app ] .",
    "in this section , we introduce the concept of a tutte polynomial for a signed graph , following closely the definitions in @xcite . the tutte polynomial defined in this paper",
    "is only slightly less general than the one defined in @xcite and the generalized kauffman bracket polynomial @xcite may still be obtained from it by factoring .",

    "one starts from a regular projection @xmath278 of the knot @xmath277 .",
    "we then shade the regions in its projection either `` white '' or `` dark '' in a checkerboard fashion , so that no two dark regions are adjacent , and no two white regions are adjacent .",

    "so if we can move diagonally over a knot crossing from one dark region to another , then these two dark regions and the crossing will be represented in @xmath0 as two vertices connected by an edge .",

    "now we have our unsigned graph . to obtain the signed version , we look at each crossing in the knot projection .",

    "if the dark region is to the right of the upper strand , we denote it as a negative crossing .",

    "this gives us @xmath289 since the writhe of this projection of @xmath285 is 9 , we obtain the jones polynomial of @xmath285 : @xmath290 this matches the known jones polynomial for @xmath285 .",
