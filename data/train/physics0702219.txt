    "control of vortices produced by flapping wings or fins to generate propulsive forces is the everyday task of birds , insects and swimming animals",

    "* ) . a wake vortex street with the sign of vorticity of each vortex reversed with respect to the typical bnard - von krmn ( bvk ) vortex street is an ubiquitous feature related to propulsive flapping motion .",
    "reverse bvk vortex streets _ have not only been observed in the wakes of swimming fish ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but also studied in detail through laboratory experiments with flapping foils @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite . the mean velocity profile associated with these thrust - producing reverse bvk streets",
    "has the form of a jet and the stability properties of this average jet flow seem closely related to the propulsive efficiency of the flapping foil @xcite .",
    "flapping systems , either natural or man - made , are often discussed in terms of a single parameter , the strouhal number , defined as the product of the flapping frequency @xmath0 and amplitude @xmath1 divided by the cruising speed @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath3 . experiments with flapping foils @xcite have shown that propulsive efficiency peaks within a narrow interval @xmath4 .",
    "data compiled by @xcite shows that observed cruise strouhal numbers for a wide range of flying and swimming animals also lie on this interval , suggesting that , not surprisingly , natural selection has tuned animals for high propulsive efficiency . however , less clear are the physical reasons that determine certain flapping configurations , with their associated vortex signature in the wake , to be the optimal choices for efficient thrust generation .",
    "although three - dimensionality plays an important role in most flapping systems , a quasi - two - dimensional picture of the wake often contains key dynamical elements , such as the creation and organization of vorticity , that are crucial in every system involving flapping foils as a means of producing propulsive forces @xcite .",

    "the reynolds number @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the foil width ( or thickness ) and @xmath9 is the kinematic viscosity , was set to 255 in the experiments reported here .",
    "this corresponds to 1173 for the chord - based reynolds number @xmath10 , which is an intermediate value in the @xmath11 range of ` intermediate reynolds numbers ' that characterize flapping - based propulsion in nature @xcite .",
    "in addition , we define a dimensionless flapping amplitude @xmath12 and a strouhal number @xmath13 as    @xmath14    although natural vortex shedding exists for the steady flap at this reynolds number even at zero - angle of incidence , no mode competition is observed in the strongly forced flapping regimes studied here .",
    "the flapping frequency used to define @xmath13 is thus equivalent to the main vortex shedding frequency .",
    "in addition , we have chosen to use a fixed length scale ( @xmath8 ) instead of the usual peak - to - peak amplitude ( @xmath1 ) in the definition of @xmath13 so that each degree of freedom of the flapping motion is represented in one non - dimensional parameter .",
    "the @xmath15 phase space thus defined allows to give a clear picture of the different observed regimes .",
    "measurements were performed using 2d particle image velocimetry ( piv ) on the horizontal mid - plane of the flap .",
    "piv was performed using a lavision system with an imagerpro @xmath16 12-bit charge - coupled device ( ccd ) camera recording pairs of images at @xmath17hz and a two rod nd : yag ( 15mj ) pulsed laser .",
    "laser sheet width was about 1 mm in the whole 100 mm @xmath5 80 mm imaging region .",
    "the time lapse between the two frames ( d@xmath18 ) was set to 12ms .",
    "for a fixed reynolds number , a point in the @xmath15 parameter space defines thus the flapping configuration and corresponds to a given vorticity signature in the wake of the foil . a parametric study as a function of the strouhal number and the non - dimensional flapping amplitude allows to characterize the different regimes in the aforementioned @xmath19 phase space and to pin down the transition zones .      in fig .",

    "is the typical case of low - amplitude flapping which produces a forced wake with features resembling a natural bnard - von krmn ( bvk ) vortex street , but with shedding frequency locked - in to the flapping frequency ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the vorticity engendered at the boundary layers on each side of the foil is rolled up in vortices that , in their downstream evolution , stay on the same side of the symmetry line of the wake , defined by the axis of the foil when parallel to the free stream velocity .",
    "accordingly , the mean flow in this case has a typical wake profile with slower speed behind the obstacle .",
    "increasing the flapping amplitude allows us to get a very clear view of the mechanism of reversal of vortex position : for amplitude @xmath21 vortices of alternating signs align on the symmetry line of the wake ( a 2s - type wake , using the nomenclature of @xcite ) , whereas for @xmath22 , the vortices shed on one side of the flap organize themselves in the wake on the other side of the symmetry line constituting the reverse bvk vortex street .",
    "the mean flow picture for this transition shows that the velocity deficit in the wake profile is almost completely erased when vortices are aligned in the symmetry line ( @xmath21 ) prior to the apparition ( at @xmath22 and more clearly at @xmath23 ) of the jet profile that is typically associated to the reverse bvk street ( see also recent numerical simulations by * ? ? ?",
    "further increase in the flapping amplitude triggers a symmetry breaking in the reverse bvk wake ( a feature previously observed for foils performing heaving motion @xcite .",
    "a strong dipolar structure that propagates obliquely to one side of the symmetry line of the wake is formed in each flapping cycle , while a much weaker single vortex is shed on the other side . in these asymmetric wakes , the quasi - two - dimensional nature of the flow",
    "is rapidly lost and the coherence of vortical structures in the horizontal mid - plane where the observations are performed does not prevail for more than two cycles .",
    "however , the symmetry features of these wakes do seem to be defined by a quasi - two - dimensional mechanism that depends on the initial conditions : the first dipole that is formed entrains fluid behind it , deflecting the mean flow in the wake and forcing the subsequent dipoles to follow the same path .",
    "this mechanism of dipole formation resulting in a deflected wake has also been observed in soap film experiments studying the wake of oscillating cylinders @xcite , supporting the idea of a mainly 2d phenomenon . in the mean flow picture ,",
    "the asymmetry of the wake can be clearly seen as a deflection of the peak in the jet profile .     vs. @xmath13 map for @xmath24 .",
    "experimental points are labeled as @xmath25 : bvk wake ; @xmath26 : aligned vortices ( 2s wake ) ; @xmath27 : reverse bvk wake ; @xmath28 : deflected reverse bvk street resulting in an asymmetric wake .",

    "[ drag_coef ] ) .",
    "a comparison of this zero - drag curve with the transition from a bvk vortex street to a reverse bvk pattern in the wake ( gray line ) shows that , for increasing flapping amplitude or frequency , the reversal of the vortex street happens before the actual drag - thrust transition in almost all the parameter range studied here .",
    "this shift shows that a region in the @xmath19 plane exists where a reversed bvk pattern can be observed in the wake of the flapping foil , but the relative thrust engendered by the flapping motion is not yet enough to overcome the total mean drag . for @xmath33 ,",
    "the two lines cross and the estimate of the drag - thrust transition stays actually slightly below the observed bvk - reverse bvk transition threshold .",
    "a possible explanation for this is that the quasi-2d hypothesis underlying the drag coefficient calculation degrades faster the higher the strouhal number , so that 3d effects might be cooperating to produce this result that is unexpected from a 2d point of view .",

    "we nonetheless verify _ a posteriori _ that the expected drag - thrust transition does not overlap the region of the parameter space where asymmetric wakes develop , so that the prediction should be reasonable .",
    "the sensitivity of the drag coefficient calculation to the @xmath45-position of the wake profile , which defines the downstream boundary of the control volume , was tested performing the momentum balance at different horizontal stations in the wake .",
    "thus , the gray ` error band ' around the @xmath43 transition line in figure [ drag_coef ] represents the fluctuation of the transition line when the calculation of @xmath42 is performed using a wake profile measured at @xmath46 ( i.e. representing an overall span in the @xmath45 direction of @xmath47 of the length of the piv measurement window ) calculation to the choice of control volume is available as supplementary material . ] .",
    "the experimental study of the wake vortices produced by a high - aspect - ratio pitching foil presented in this paper gives evidence characterizing two key dynamical features relevant to wake vortex systems engendered by flapping motion : first , the transition from the well - known bnard - von krmn ( bvk ) wake to the reversed vortex street that signals propulsive wakes , and second , the symmetry breaking of this reverse bvk pattern giving rise to an asymmetric wake .",
    "albeit the inherently - three - dimensional nature of the wake dynamics resulting from the finite span of the foil in the hydrodynamic tunnel , the quasi - two - dimensional picture studied here by focusing on the near wake captures the essential of the vorticity dynamics because the main vortex shedding is induced when the foil motion changes direction ( see also * ? ? ?",
