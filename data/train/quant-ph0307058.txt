    "a nonlocal operation is one which operates on distinct subsystems , and can not be expressed as a tensor product of operations on the individual subsystems .",
    "such operations arise via an interaction hamiltonian between the subsystems .",
    "nonlocal operations may be used to create entanglement between subsystems , and also to perform classical communication .",
    "in fact , it is not possible to achieve either of these tasks without an interaction between the subsystems . in characterizing quantum operations ,",
    "it is thus important to determine the capacities for creating entanglement or performing communication .",
    "these capacities provide a characterization of the strength of the operations @xcite .    shared classical information",
    "may be considered to be the classical equivalent of entanglement .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to consider the process of classical communication to be the classical equivalent of entanglement creation .",
    "one may therefore expect that there is a close relationship between the capacities for these two tasks .",
    "in fact , it has been shown @xcite that there are a number of inequalities between the various capacities for classical communication and entanglement creation . in this paper",
    "we make a direct numerical comparison between these capacities .",
    "the capacities of operations for creating entanglement have been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "it is relatively straightforward to determine the entanglement capability for infinitesimal operations @xcite . for finite operations ,",
    "most results are restricted to numerical results for certain classes of two - qubit operations @xcite .",
    "we study the same classes of operations here , and the results we present for the entanglement reproduce those given in ref .",
    "@xcite , except for some data points where we believe our results are more accurate .",
    "the capacities for classical communication were initially considered for simple operations , such as the cnot and swap operations @xcite .",
    "it is more difficult to consider the classical communication for general operations , because general operations can not be used to perform perfect communication .",
    "@xcite introduced asymptotic capacities , where the average communication when the operation is performed a very large number of times is considered .",
    "when the operation is performed a large number of times , it is possible to use error correcting techniques to reduce the probability of error to be arbitrarily small .    for the purposes of numerical investigation ,",
    "it is not practical to use asymptotic capacities , as the number of variables that would need to be optimized over to obtain a reasonable approximation is extremely large",
    ". a far more practical type of capacity is that based on the holevo information of ensembles . for these capacities , only the states and probabilities in the initial ensemble",
    "need be optimized over in the numerical analysis .",
    "in addition , there are connections between the capacities defined via the change in holevo information and the asymptotic capacities @xcite .    although it is feasible to calculate capacities based on the holevo information , it is far more computationally difficult than evaluating the entanglement capacities",
    ". it would therefore be useful if it were possible to use the entanglement capacities to estimate the capacities based on the holevo information . in this paper",
    "we numerically study the relationship between these capacities , and show that although they are not equal , the values we have calculated are quite close .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : defs ] we explain the definitions of the various capacities . in sec .",
    "[ sec : inzer ] we give numerical results for the communication capacity based on the holevo information obtained when the initial ensemble has zero holevo information , and compare these capacities to the entanglement that may be created from initial states that have zero entanglement . then in sec .",
    "[ sec : ingen ] we give results for the increase in holevo information for general initial ensembles , and compare these capacities to the increase in entanglement for arbitrary initially entangled states .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ concl ] , and in the appendix give a detailed explanation of the numerical techniques used to calculate the results presented .",
    "first we summarize the definitions of the various capacities . throughout this paper",
    "we divide the system into two subsystems , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and denote the hilbert spaces by @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the party in possession of subsystem @xmath0 will be referred to as alice and the party in possession of subsystem @xmath1 will be referred to as bob .",
    "the subsystems @xmath0 and @xmath1 are divided into further subsystems : @xmath4 the operation @xmath5 acts only upon @xmath6 , and the hilbert spaces @xmath7 and @xmath8 are ancillas .",
    "the ancillas may have dimension that is arbitrarily large but finite .",
    "there are two main ways of defining capacities for entanglement .",
    "the first is the entanglement that may be obtained when the initial state is unentangled @xmath9 the quantity @xmath10 is the entropy of entanglement @xmath11 $ ] , where @xmath12 . throughout",
    "we employ logarithms to base 2 , so the entanglement is expressed in units of ebits .",
    "the second definition is the maximum increase in entanglement when the initial state may be an arbitrary pure entangled state .",
    "@xmath13.\\ ] ] it is also possible to define the capacity in terms of the entanglement of formation and allow mixed states ; we do not separately consider this case , because allowing mixed states does not alter the capacity @xcite .",
    "another alternative definition of the entanglement capacity is based on the average entanglement that may be obtained in the limit that the operation is performed an extremely large number of times and the initial state is unentangled @xcite .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that this capacity is equal to the maximum increase in entanglement as defined in eq .",
    "( [ endif ] ) .",
    "thus the numerical results presented also apply to the asymptotic entanglement capacity .    in the numerical search , it is not possible to consider ancilla spaces with arbitrarily large dimension .",
    "it is known @xcite that the ancilla spaces need have dimension no larger than the hilbert spaces @xmath14 and @xmath15 for the capacity with initially unentangled states .",
    "it has also been found numerically @xcite that the same is true for the capacity where initially entangled states are allowed .    in the results presented below ,",
    "we use a fixed dimension for the ancilla spaces . for simplicity",
    "we use equal dimensions on the two ancilla spaces @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we use a superscript on the capacity when it is necessary to indicate the dimension of the ancilla space used .",
    "for example , @xmath16 is the maximum change in entanglement when the ancilla spaces are each of dimension 4 .",
    "when we refer to multiple results with different ancilla dimensions we will use a superscript @xmath17 .",
    "we will omit the superscript in the case of @xmath18 when the dimensions of the ancilla spaces are at least as large as those of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , because this is known to be sufficient to obtain the capacity for arbitrarily large ancilla .",
    "the classical communication capacities that we will consider are based upon the holevo information of ensembles .",
    "an ensemble is a set of states @xmath19 that are supplied with probabilities @xmath20 .",
    "each state @xmath21 is a pure state shared between alice and bob , and alice chooses the index @xmath22 .",
    "the ensemble is denoted by @xmath23 .",
    "we also define the ensemble of reduced density matrices possessed by bob as @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "the holevo information of the ensemble @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 from the holevo - schumacher - westmoreland theorem @xcite , the holevo information gives the average communication that may be performed from alice to bob by coding over multiple states .",
    "similarly to the case for entanglement , we may define capacities based on the maximum change in holevo information .",
    "one definition that we will use is the maximum final holevo information when the initial ensemble has zero holevo information . for the initial ensemble",
    ", we have an initial state @xmath28 , and alice encodes @xmath22 by applying a local operation @xmath29 . for the capacity , the supremum is taken over the initial state @xmath28 , the encoding operations @xmath29 and the probabilities @xmath20 : @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "note that the notation we are using here differs from ref .",
    "@xcite , where the symbol @xmath32 was used for this capacity .",
    "we may also define the maximum change in holevo information when the initial ensemble is arbitrary : @xmath33 here we are using the notation conventions @xmath34 this capacity is equivalent to the capacity @xmath35 defined in ref .",
    "@xcite . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , this capacity is equal to the average entanglement - assisted communication that may be performed from alice to bob .",
    "therefore this quantity may be interpreted as the asymptotic communication capacity , just as @xmath36 may be interpreted as the asymptotic entanglement capability .",
    "one may also interpret @xmath37 in terms of asymptotic capacities .",
    "the capacity @xmath37 gives the holevo information after a single application of the operation @xmath5 .",
    "this communication can not actually be performed for a single ensemble ; it is necessary to code over multiple states to perform this average communication .",
    "therefore @xmath37 may be interpreted as the asymptotic communication capacity if the communication protocol is limited to the relatively simple scheme where coding is performed over multiple final states .",
    "this is equivalent to restricting all the applications of @xmath5 to be performed at the same time ( on input states that are not entangled with each other ) , rather than allowing the output of one application of @xmath5 to be used as part of the input to another application of @xmath5 , as in the general case .    as in the case of the entanglement",
    ", it is not possible to use ancilla spaces of arbitrarily large dimension in the numerical search .",
    "in addition , it is not possible to use arbitrarily large numbers of states in the ensemble . in the results presented below , we perform calculations for restricted ensembles where there is a fixed number of states in the ensemble and a fixed dimension for the ancilla spaces ( the ancilla spaces are again taken to be of equal dimension ) .",
    "we use superscripts on the capacities to indicate the number of states in the ensemble and the dimension of the ancilla spaces .",
    "for example , @xmath38 is the maximum change in holevo information for two states in the ensemble and ancillas each of dimension 4 .",
    "we use a superscript @xmath17 to refer to multiple capacities with different ancilla dimensions or ensemble sizes .",
    "it must be emphasized that our use of superscripts in this paper differs from that in ref .",
    "it is clear that the capacity @xmath37 is an analogous quantity for communication to @xmath18 for entanglement .",
    "similarly @xmath39 is analogous to @xmath36 for entanglement . in this section",
    "we perform a direct numerical comparison between the two capacities @xmath37 and @xmath18 . in the next section",
    "we compare the capacities @xmath39 and @xmath36 .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on two - qubit operations .",
    "it is not possible to perform calculations for the entire range of two - qubit operations . to make the problem feasible",
    ", we only consider a limited number of examples of two - qubit operations .",
    "in particular , we consider operations of the form : @xmath40 where @xmath41 here @xmath42 are the pauli sigma operators .",
    "the operations @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 correspond to the cnot , dcnot and swap families of operations considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in order to consider the complete range of two - qubit operations in the case of entanglement",
    ", it would only be necessary to consider operations of the form ( [ simpleu ] ) , with @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "this derivation relies on the fact that any two - qubit operation may be simplified to one of the form ( [ simpleu ] ) with @xmath47 using local operations @xcite .",
    "in addition to using local operations , the derivation in ref .",
    "@xcite relies on the fact that the entanglement capabilities of @xmath5 and @xmath48 are identical ( which implies that all the @xmath49 may be taken to be positive ) .",
    "similarly , for the holevo information , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "thus the capacities of @xmath5 and @xmath48 to increase the holevo information are identical .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain results for the complete range of two - qubit operations , it would only be necessary to consider operations of the form ( [ simpleu ] ) with @xmath46 for both entanglement and holevo information .",
    "this restriction on the values of the @xmath49 defines a three dimensional region of values . in this paper",
    "we do not consider the entire region ; however , the operations @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 which we consider form three lines on the boundaries of this region .",
    "sophisticated numerical maximization techniques were used to find the values of @xmath18 and @xmath52 ; the details are given in the appendix .",

    "an ancilla dimension of 2 is sufficient to obtain the asymptotic capacity @xmath18 for all two - qubit operations @xcite . in all the calculations presented for @xmath18 in this section ,",
    "an ancilla dimension of 2 was used ; we have therefore omitted the superscript on this capacity .",

    "an ancilla dimension of 1 is equivalent to no ancilla ; we will take the case of no ancilla to be an ancilla dimension of 1 for convenience in the notation .",
    "just as in the case of the entanglement , these results indicate that the maximum final holevo information is obtained without ancillas .",
    "in addition , only two states in the ensemble are required .",
    "we find no improvement in using up to four states in the ensemble , and ancillas of dimension up to four .",
    "it was found that the maximum increase in the holevo information was obtained with equal probabilities when there were two states in the ensemble . when four states in the ensemble were used , in most cases two of the probabilities approached zero whereas the other two approached @xmath62 .",

    "it was found that the two capacities agreed to precision better than one part in @xmath63 .",

    "the values of @xmath128 and @xmath129 are shown as the crosses and squares , respectively.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to summarize , our results strongly indicate that @xmath39 is strictly greater than @xmath36 for most two - qubit operations , rather than simply greater than or equal to , we stated in refs .  @xcite .",
    "in addition , our results show that the maximum change in holevo information is not obtained for ancilla dimensions of two , as appears to be the case for the entanglement .",
    "the indications are that there is no ancilla dimension that is sufficiently large that @xmath39 is achieved , so @xmath39 would only be obtained asymptotically in the limit of large ancilla dimension .",
    "our results demonstrate that , for two - qubit operations , there are close relationships between the capacities based on the holevo information and the capacities based on the entanglement . in most cases , the largest values calculated for @xmath37 ( with the largest ancilla dimension and ensemble size ) were equal to @xmath18 . in some cases values of @xmath37",
    "were calculated that are slightly above @xmath18 , but the difference was very small .",
    "in addition , the maximum values calculated for @xmath39 were very close to those for @xmath36 .",
    "these results indicate that the communication capacities @xmath37 and @xmath39 , which are very difficult to calculate , may be estimated from the entanglement capacities @xmath18 and @xmath36 , respectively , which may be calculated far more rapidly .",
    "we have also found that , in all cases tested ( except the trivial cases where @xmath97 or @xmath98 ) , @xmath39 is greater than @xmath36 , rather than just greater than or equal to , as stated in refs .  @xcite . as @xmath39 is equal to the asymptotic communication capacity in a single direction @xcite , and the asymptotic bidirectional communication capacity is no larger than @xmath130 for two qubit operations @xcite , our results show that there is an inevitable trade - off involved in performing bidirectional communication .",
    "that is , it is not possible to perform an average communication of @xmath39 in both directions at the same time .",
    "our results also demonstrate that larger capacities @xmath52 and @xmath131 are obtained when the dimension of the ancillas is increased above 2 , in contrast to the case of the entanglement capacities , for which an ancilla dimension of 2 is sufficient .",
    "this has been shown analytically for @xmath18 in ref .",
    "@xcite , and found numerically for @xmath36 in ref .",
    "@xcite ( our numerical results also support this ) .",
    "it must be emphasized that there are limitations on the conclusions that can be drawn from the results due to their numerical nature .",
    "the capacities found here were found by numerical maximization , which has the drawback that it is possible that , in some cases , a local maximum may have been found , rather than the global maximum . however , the calculations presented here were performed very carefully , and in some cases repeated many times with different random numbers , in order to avoid local maxima .",
    "therefore we are reasonably confident that the results presented here are very close to the global maxima .",
    "a more serious issue is that it is not possible to perform calculations for arbitrarily large ancilla dimensions .",
    "although it has been proven that an ancilla dimension of 2 is sufficient for @xmath18 , this has not been proven for @xmath36 .",
    "here we have found that @xmath92 is unchanged as the ancilla dimension is raised from 2 to 5 .",
    "this result strongly indicates that the values obtained for @xmath92 are the correct asymptotic values .",
    "nevertheless , it is , in principle , possible that larger values of @xmath36 may be achieved for larger ancilla dimensions than those tested . in order to show conclusively that there is a strict inequality between @xmath39 and @xmath36",
    ", it would be necessary to prove that the asymptotic entangling capacity is achieved for an ancilla dimension of 2 .    in the cases of @xmath37 and @xmath39 , it is more difficult to estimate the capacity because the capacity increases with ancilla dimension .",
    "for @xmath39 the capacity only increases by a small amount as the ancilla dimension is increased from 2 to 5 , indicating that the results are a good approximation of the capacity for arbitrary ancilla dimension . for @xmath72 and @xmath77 , there are significant increases in the capacity with the ancilla dimension up to an ancilla dimension of 4 , but there is no increase as the ancilla dimension is increased to 5 .",
    "this result indicates that an ancilla dimension of 4 is sufficient , though further results for higher ancilla dimensions would be required to be confident of this .",
    "in addition there is the problem that it is not possible to perform calculations for arbitrarily large ensemble sizes . for the operation @xmath43 it was found that the capacity was not increased as the ensemble size",
    "was increased above 2 , so it is likely that an ensemble size of 2 is sufficient for this operation . for the operations @xmath44 and @xmath45 it was found that the capacities @xmath52 and @xmath131 increased with the ensemble size up to an ensemble size of 4 .",
    "it is possible that the capacities may be larger for larger ensemble sizes ; this is a topic for future research .",
    "the numerical techniques used to search for the maxima are similar to simulated annealing @xcite . for the case of the entanglement capacity @xmath132 , a vector of complex numbers , @xmath133 , represents the initial tensor product state .",
    "the first @xmath134 numbers are the coefficients representing alice s local state , @xmath135 , and the last @xmath136 numbers are the coefficients representing bob s local state , @xmath137 .",
    "the total state is simply @xmath138 .",
    "the initial values of @xmath139 were selected using a gaussian distribution followed by normalization . throughout this section ,",
    "all gaussian distributions for complex variables are real gaussians multiplied by random phases ( with a uniform distribution ) .    at each step another vector of complex random numbers , @xmath140 , was selected via a gaussian distribution .",
    "if the state represented by @xmath141 ( where @xmath142 is a normalization constant ) gave a larger final entanglement after application of @xmath5 , then the coefficients @xmath143 were replaced with @xmath141 .",
    "this technique is equivalent to applying simulated annealing with a temperature of zero , because in no case were coefficients chosen that gave a smaller final entanglement .",
    "it was found that this technique provided very rapid convergence , and using non - zero temperatures did not provide better convergence .",
    "initially the standard deviation in the gaussian distribution used for the increments , @xmath144 , was chosen to be 1 .",
    "the value of @xmath144 was halved each time there were 1000 consecutive increments tested with none providing a larger final entanglement .",
    "this process was terminated when @xmath144 fell below @xmath145 . at this stage",
    "the progressive changes in the final entanglement were on the order of @xmath146 or less .    in the case of the capacity @xmath52 , a vector of complex random numbers , @xmath147 , was used to represent one initial state in the ensemble , @xmath28 .",
    "initial values of @xmath139 were selected using a gaussian distribution then normalizing .",
    "the remainder of the initial states in the ensemble were obtained by local unitary operations , @xmath148 .",
    "these unitary operations were represented by matrices of complex numbers , @xmath149 .",
    "the initial values of @xmath149 were selected by generating complex random numbers with a gaussian distribution , then using gram - schmidt orthormalization on the row vectors .",
    "the probabilities were represented by a vector of real numbers @xmath150 .",
    "initial values were selected using a uniform distribution then normalizing .    at each step , complex random numbers for the increments @xmath151 and @xmath152 were chosen using a gaussian distribution with standard deviation @xmath144 , and real random numbers for the increments @xmath153 were chosen using a uniform distribution from @xmath154 to @xmath155 .",
    "these increments were used to create a new ensemble with state @xmath141 and probabilities @xmath156 .",
    "the new operations for the new ensemble were obtained by adding the increments @xmath152 to @xmath149 then applying gram - schmidt orthonormalization to the row vectors .    in this case the temperature of the simulated annealing was not taken to be zero .",
    "the new ensemble was selected if the new value for the holveo information after application of @xmath5 , @xmath157 , was larger than the previous value , @xmath158 .",
    "if the new value was lower , the new ensemble was selected if @xmath159 where @xmath160 is a uniform random number between zero and one , and @xmath161 is a tolerance equivalent to the temperature .",
    "the value of the tolerance @xmath161 was initially taken to be @xmath162 .",
    "the value of the final holevo information was checked every 10000 iterations ; if it had decreased , then the tolerance was divided by 2 , and if it had increased , then the tolerance was multiplied by @xmath163 .",
    "this adjustment was found to provide reasonably rapid convergence to the final value .    there were two alternative schemes used to adjust the standard deviation , @xmath144 , in the gaussian distribution used for the increments to the ensemble .",
    "the first was similar to that for the entanglement , except that @xmath144 was halved if 10000 alternatives were tested with no increase in the holevo information .",
    "the other scheme was to adjust @xmath144 such that approximately 20% of the alternatives were accepted .",
    "only the first scheme was used in the initial part of the calculation ( for the first @xmath164 or so increments tested ) . for later parts of the calculation",
    "both alternatives were tried .",
    "the numerical techniques used to calculate @xmath92 and @xmath131 were similar to those used for @xmath132 and @xmath52 , though there are minor differences . in the case of @xmath92 , the initial state ,",
    "@xmath28 was taken to be a general entangled state , rather than a tensor product of two local states .",
    "this state was represented by a vector of coefficients @xmath165 .",
    "the case of @xmath131 is rather simpler than that for @xmath52 . rather than it being necessary to condider a set of unitary operations and probabilities , the ensemble was simply represented by a set of complex coefficients @xmath166 for all of the states in the ensemble . rather than separately storing probabilities",
    ", these states were not normalized , and the normalizations of these states were taken to be the probabilities",
