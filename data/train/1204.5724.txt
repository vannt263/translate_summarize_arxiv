    "given data from an hiv vaccine trial , we are interested in determining whether the rate of hiv acquisition is lower among vaccine recipients ( @xmath0 ) than among placebo recipients ( @xmath1 ) ( over a given period of time - since - vaccination , eg within the first 18 months ) .",
    "we are furthermore interested in estimating the ratio of these rates ( with a ratio of @xmath2 indicating a lower rate among vaccine recipients ) .",
    "finally , we define vaccine efficacy ( ve ) as @xmath3 , and wish to test assertions about this quantity , such as `` ve @xmath4 50% '' .",
    "the data is of the form of right - censored survival data .",
    "that is , we have a total number of subjects @xmath5 assigned to the placebo group and a total number @xmath6 assigned to the vaccine group . for each subject @xmath7",
    "we have an estimated infection time @xmath8 if subject @xmath7 became infected during the course of the trial , or a loss - to - followup time @xmath9 if he did not become infected ( this might be the total trial duration for most participants , but could also be some earlier time if the subject dropped out of the trial ) .",
    "we also know the vaccine treatment assignment indicator @xmath10 for each subject , such that @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    wishing to avoid parametric assumptions",
    ", we temporarily eschew the usual cox regression approach , and introduce instead a nonparametric method employing dempster - shafer ( ds ) analysis . unlike the alternative nonparametric kaplan - meier method , in which right - censored data are accomodated by conditioning on non - censoredness ( or `` at risk''-ness ) , this approach considers the whole dataset for its inferences . as",
    "such its conclusions are not subject to the post - randomization selection bias concerns which limit causal interpretability of estimates based on kaplan - meier curves .    like the kaplan - meier approach , this ds method for estimating hazard ratios",
    "is based on estimates of the cumulative distribution functions ( cdfs ) of the `` failure times '' ( here infection times ) within each treatment group . if we knew the ( true , population )",
    "cdfs @xmath13 and @xmath14 for these groups , we could determine the failure rates @xmath0 and @xmath1 for any arbitrary time interval @xmath15 by eg @xmath16 .",
    "this is just the population fraction that fail in that time interval .    to describe the method we therefore begin with the estimation of a single cdf .",
    "thereafter we will consider how two such estimates may be used in concert to make inferences about a ratio of two rates such as @xmath17 .",
    "we note throughout that estimates of cdfs have many potential uses , of which the present discussion will focus on just this one ( which has relevance to the analysis of survival data such as the vaccine trial data which we use as a concrete illustration ) .",
    "dempster - shafer analysis ( dsa ) is an approach to statistical reasoning which tolerates evidence that is ambiguous with respect to an assertion of interest .",
    "for example , using dsa to address the hypothesis that a possibly - unfair coin has probability @xmath18 of heads after observing 3 heads in 10 tosses yields evidence of the form @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is evidence `` for '' the hypothesis that @xmath18 , @xmath21 is evidence `` against '' it , and the remainder , @xmath22 , is evidence that is ambiguous with respect to the hypothsis ( we say it is the probability of `` do nt know '' ) .",
    "[ etc .. copied and perhaps altered from the dsbanff paper or elsewhere ]",
    "we now turn to the nonparametric ds estimation of a univariate , invertable cdf @xmath23 from data assumed to have been randomly sampled from it .",
    "suppose we observe @xmath24 data points and order them such that @xmath25 .",
    "we make inferences about @xmath23 via the auxiliary random variables @xmath26 , which are independent and uniformly distributed .",
    "the intuition is as follows : if we knew the inverse function @xmath27 , we could have generated the data by first drawing @xmath24 uniforms and then applying to each the inverse cdf , such that for any @xmath28 we define a corresponding @xmath29 . on an x - y plot of the cdf @xmath23 , we could draw a horizontal line from each @xmath10 to the @xmath23 curve , and from there drop vertically to the x axis to determine the value of @xmath30 .",
    "we need nt assume that the data were in fact generated in this way , but this perspective allows us to make inferences about @xmath23 .",
    "we define random variables @xmath31 for the height of the cdf at each observed value @xmath30 .",
    "since the @xmath30 are ordered , the correspondingly ordered @xmath31 are jointly distributed as the order statistics of @xmath24 uniforms .",
    "evidence for and against assertions about the function @xmath23 may be assessed via the random variables @xmath32 .",
    "for instance if we observe 10 ordered failure times @xmath33 , and we wish to infer the population fraction whose failure times fall between the fourth and sixth of these ( that is , we wish to infer @xmath34 , we may do so via the joint distribution of the corresonding random variables @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( as @xmath37 ) . that difference is distributed as @xmath38 .",
    "dsa allows us to make inferences about the cdf at points other than the observed values , since we are able to represent our uncertainty using a mass function over sets ( or intervals ) of values .",
    "for instance , if the values of @xmath39 ( of 10 observed failure times ) were @xmath40 , respectively , and we were interested in testing the hypothesis that at least 15% of the population fails between times 25 and 75 , we could accumulate evidence for this assertion as the probability that @xmath41 , and against it by the probability that @xmath42 .",
    "such evidence will not generally sum to 1 ; the remaining evidence is ambiguous and contributes to the residual `` do nt know '' . in this instance",
    ", we get a @xmath19 of @xmath43 .",
    "note that these events are mutually exclusive and thus may be computed separately .",
    "if we introduce right - censored data of the `` loss to followup '' ( ltf ) type , we simply treat the number of failures by a particular time ( and hence the order - statistic - of - interest ) as somewhere between the observed cumulative number of failures and that number plus the cumulative number of ltfs by that time .",
    "for instance if we modify the above example by converting one of the previously - observed - to - be - larger values ( eg @xmath44 ) by a subject that is lost to followup at time 50 , then we are nt sure whether the order - indices of `` @xmath45 '' and `` @xmath46 '' are @xmath47 , @xmath48 , or @xmath49 .",
    "this increases @xmath50 , because now we calculate the evidence @xmath21 against the hypothesis as the probability that @xmath51 , because we do nt know whether @xmath52 is above or below the failure time of the lost - to - followup subject .",
    "thus we get a @xmath19 of @xmath53 .",
    "note that we know that the number of new failures between any two time points is bounded below by the observed number of new failures occuring after the lower time point and up to - and - including the upper time point .",
    "it is bounded above by that number plus the total number of ltfs that have accumulated up to the upper time point . if we represent the data as a two - row matrix @xmath54 with cumulative sums of failures @xmath55 and cumulative sums of ltfs @xmath56 at each discrete time point @xmath57 for which we have any observations , then the number of new failures between any two of these time points @xmath58 is bounded below by @xmath59 and above by @xmath60 .",
    "returning to our initial example ( with no ltfs ) , suppose we wish to test the hypothesis that between 10% and 20% of the population fails between times 25 and 75 .",
    "the evidence for this assertion is the probability of the event that both @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the evidence against the assertion is given by the probability that either @xmath63 or @xmath64 .",
    "in general , to test a hypothesis that between ( quantiles ) @xmath65 and @xmath66 of the population falls between ( times ) @xmath67 and @xmath68 , we first need to identify the indices into the columns of matrix @xmath54 of the nearest observed time points to @xmath67 and @xmath68 , both above ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) and below ( @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) each . in our example , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 .    with these in hand , the general formula , in the absence of ltfs ,",
    "is that the evidence for the hypothesis ( that between @xmath65 and @xmath66 of the population fails between times @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) is given by the probability of the event that both @xmath79 and @xmath80 . the evidence against it is given by the sum of the probabilities that @xmath81 and that @xmath82 .",
    "due to the symmetry of the intervals separating the uniform order statistics @xmath32 , the actual orders are irrelevant to these probability calculations : the differences are sufficient .",
    "we will refer to the difference @xmath83 as the `` internal interval count '' @xmath84 and to the difference @xmath85 as the `` external interval count '' @xmath86 .",
    "what matters is the probability distributions of intervals @xmath87 and @xmath88 of size @xmath84 and @xmath86 , which marginally are given by beta distributions : @xmath89 and @xmath90 , where @xmath24 is the total number of subjects . in words ,",
    "@xmath20 , the evidence for the hypothesis , is given by the probability that both the internal interval @xmath87 is greater than the lower quantile @xmath65 and that the external interval @xmath88 is less than the higher quantile @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath21 , the evidence against the hypothesis , is given by the probability that either the internal interval is too large or that the external interval is too small .",
    "the remaining evidence is ambiguous with respect to the hypothesis , so it is assigned to @xmath50 , `` do nt know '' .    in the presence of ltfs",
    ", we must consider that the actual number of failures between two time points @xmath58 is potentially unknown , but is bounded ( by @xmath91 and @xmath92 as described above ) .",
    "thus where in the above formulae we used the number of failures directly from the @xmath54 matrix , in general we must use the appropriate upper or lower bound .",
    "if we define the `` maximum internal interval count '' @xmath93 as @xmath94 and the `` minimum internal interval count '' @xmath95 as @xmath96 , and likewise define the `` maximum external interval count '' @xmath97 as @xmath98 and the `` minimum external interval count '' @xmath99 as @xmath100 , then we can in general compute the evidence @xmath21 against the hypothesis as the sum of the probablities that the maximum internal interval @xmath101 is less than the lower quantile @xmath65 and that the minimum external interval @xmath102 is greater than the upper quantile @xmath66 .",
    "we compute the evidence @xmath20 for the hypothesis as the probability that ( simultaneously ) both the minimum internal interval @xmath103 is greater than the lower quantile @xmath65 and the maximum external interval @xmath104 is less than the upper quantile @xmath66 .",
    "this is most readily calculated via its complement , since this is just @xmath105 .",
    "since these are mutually exclusive events , the probabilities may be computed separately , and each is computed simply via the beta cdf ."
