    "the lenz - ising model is probably the simplest non - trivial model for cooperative behavior that shows spontaneous breaking of symmetry . because of this simplicity and the fact that each individual element of the model modifies its behavior according to the other individuals in its vicinity",
    ", it has a vast number of applications ranging from solid - state physics to biology @xcite .",
    "an important extension to this model is the introduction of disorder such as ; random external fields , random exchange parameters , and dilution , where only a fraction p of the lattice sites are occupied by spins . in particular",
    ", the two dimensional diluted ferromagnetic random ising model is very important to describe magnetic properties of several condensed matter systems .",
    "moreover , it constitutes a marginal situation of the harris criterion @xcite , and for many years there has been several theoretical and numerical studies @xcite in order to clarify the properties of the dilution model .    on the other hand , only in the last ten years the `` persistence '' problem in the randomic two - dimensional ferromagnetic ising model has attracted considerable interest@xcite . in this most general form , this problem involves the fraction of space which persists in its initial state until some time later .",
    "hence , in the non - equilibrium dynamics of spin systems we are interested in the fraction of spins @xmath0 , that persist in the same state as at @xmath9 up to some later time @xmath5 .",
    "for the pure ferromagnetic d - dimensional @xmath10 ising model , @xmath0 has been found to decay algebraically@xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a non - trivial persistence exponent .",
    "for the same model @xcite at higher dimensions @xmath13 and for the two - dimensional ferromagnetic @xmath14-state potts model@xcite @xmath15 it has been shown through computer simulations that @xmath0 is not equal to zero for @xmath16 .",
    "this characterictic is some time called as `` blocking '' .",
    "therefore , if @xmath17 we can reformulate the problem by restricting our observation to those spins that eventually flip . hence , we can consider the behavior of @xmath18 by considering the dynamics of the local order parameter the persistence problem can be generalized to non - zero temperatures@xcite recently@xcite the attention has been turned to the persistence problem in systems containing disorder .",
    "numerical simulations of the zero - temperature dynamics of the bond diluted ( weak dilution @xcite or strong dilution@xcite ) two - dimensional ising model also reported `` blocking '' evidences .",
    "howard@xcite has found evidence of an exponential decay of the persistence with blocking for the homogeneous ferromagnetic ising model on the homogeneous tree of degree three ( t ) with random spin configuration at time @xmath19 .",
    "here we present results of an extensive numerical study of the persistence of the ferromagnetic ising model on the voronoi - delaunay lattice . in this lattice ,",
    "the coordination number and the distance between the first neighbors sites is randomic . as the bond length between the first neighbors varies randomly from neighbor to neighbor",
    ", we consider that the coupling factor depends on the relative distance @xmath20 between sites @xmath21 and @xmath22 according to the following expression : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a constant and @xmath25 .",
    "the question to be answered here is : does the persistence behavior change with this type of randomness or is its behavior the same as in the diluted ferromagnetic ising model in a regular lattice ? in the present work , we show that , with this type of randomness , @xmath26 presents an exponential decay as in the strongly diluted ferromagnetic ising model in two - dimension @xcite in contrast with the behavior of the pure and weakly diluted models .",
    "the voronoi construction or tessellation for a given set of points in the plane is defined as follows . for each point , we first determine the polygonal cell consisting of the region of space nearer to that point than any other point .",
    "whenever two such cells share an edge , they are considered to be neighbors . from the voronoi tessellation , we can obtain the dual lattice by the following procedure : when two cells are neighbors , a link is placed between the two points located in the cells . from the links , one obtains the triangulation of space that is called the delaunay lattice .",
    "the delaunay lattice is dual to the voronoy tessellation in the sense that points correspond to cells , links to edges and triangles to the vertices of the voronoi tessellation .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional ising ferromagnetic on this poissonian random lattice which hamiltonian is given by : @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the ising spins situated on every site of a delaunay lattice with @xmath29 sites and periodic boundary conditions ; @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the temperature and @xmath32 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the summation in eq .",
    "@xmath33 runs over all nearest - neighbors pairs of sites ( points in the delaunay construction ) . in this lattice",
    "the coordination number varies locally between @xmath34 and @xmath35 and the coupling factor @xmath36 depends on the distance between first neighbors according to eq .",

    "we perform simulations over a lattice with @xmath38",
    ". a randomly initial configuration of spins is obtained and @xmath0 is calculated over @xmath40 of monte carlo steps and a quenched average is done over 10 different delaunay lattices for each monte carlo step .",
    "the temperature zero glauber dynamics was utilized in order to check the number of spins that never change their state at a time @xmath5 . in this dynamics",
    "we start with a randomly initial spin configuration and allow it to be updated by selecting one spin to be flipped at random or following a given logical sequence .",
    "the selected spin , @xmath41 , is flipped or not according to @xmath42 , where @xmath42 , is the energy of site @xmath21 . if @xmath43 the spin @xmath41 is flipped with probability one . if @xmath44 the spin @xmath41 is flipped with probability @xmath45 chosen at random .",

    "this result is contradictory for us once we know that for @xmath62 the ferromagnetic ising model on a delaunay lattice has the same critical exponents that the pure ferromagnetic ising model in a square lattice has@xcite .",
    "this fact does not agree with the persistence behavior of the pure and weakly diluted ferromagnetic ising model reported by jain @xcite .      in summary",
    "we have presented new data for the zero - temperature dynamics of the two - dimensional ferromagnetic ising model on a random poissonian lattice .",
    "this system exhibit `` blocking '' what means that the persistence does not go to zero when @xmath16 .",
    "we also find that @xmath26 decay exponentially in the long time regime .",
    "the fraction of `` frozen '' sites increases from a non - zero value with the parameter @xmath7 .",
    "our results strongly suggest that the persistence behavior is not algebraic supporting the suggestion that the decay of the persistence probability can be not - algebraic for certain classes of models ."
