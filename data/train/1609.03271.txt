    "our knowledge of galaxy evolution at early cosmic times , in particular at the epoch when star formation and agn activity reach their maximum , with redshift in the @xmath12 to @xmath14.5 range , owes much to the study of quasar hosts ( for a review see @xcite , for recent new results see @xcite ) .",
    "four main actors of this evolution are accessible to observation : the supermassive black hole in the centre , the gas reservoir from which stars are formed , its dust content @xmath2 a proxy of star formation @xmath2 and the stars themselves .",
    "the fifth main actor , dark matter , is not directly accessible to observation .",
    "typically , each of these covers a specific frequency range in the rest frame : optical and x rays for the black hole , millimetre / sub - millimetre for the molecular gas , infrared for the dust and optical for the stars .",
    "these observations are reduced to a few quantities that summarize our knowledge of the observed galaxy , such as masses and luminosities of the above mentioned components , star formation rate , dynamical mass , starburstiness , etc .",
    "the molecule that is most commonly used as a tracer of the gas component is carbon monoxide , the rotation levels of which allow for probing differentially regions of different levels of excitation .",
    "other tracers , such as carbon and nitrogen fine structure lines , have also been detected successfully .",
    "it is only recently that some gas and dust components of high redshift quasar hosts and sub - millimetre galaxies could be spatially resolved , usually taking advantage of the important magnification provided by gravitational lensing @xcite .",
    "one of these is the host galaxy of rx j0911.4 + 0551 ( hereafter referred to as rx j0911 ) , which we studied earlier using plateau de bure interferometer observations @xcite and which is the subject of the present article .",
    "while many quasar hosts and sub - millimetre galaxies hosting an agn have been detected at redshifts between @xmath12 and @xmath14.5 , most of them have been observed in the continuum and only few on molecular or atomic lines .",
    "most of the time , the sources are only marginally resolved spatially ; in the case of gravitational lensing one must differentiate between resolving the strongly lensed images from each other , which does not directly tell us about the size of the source , and resolving the source , which requires a better spatial resolution and a good knowledge of the lensing potential . the resolved images , while giving often evidence for extended dust and gas components , the former being relatively more compact , benefit rarely from a sufficient space resolution for their morphology to be reconstructed in the source plane .",
    "table 1 lists some typical cases chosen among the better resolved .    from their study",
    ", one learns that they are often the seat of mergers , in particular wet mergers that are identified by comparing the respective locations of the optical , gas and dust components .",
    "examples are j 123707 , smm j02399 and bri 1335 .",
    "typically , mergers are identified with dimensions in excess of a kiloparsec in the source plane .",
    "mergers cause the gravitational field to strongly increase locally , triggering the local collapse of gas clouds and causing star bursts .",
    "these are seen as important sources of dust away from the central supermassive black hole . in cases where the gas and dust components are roughly concentric with the supermassive black hole , with dimensions",
    "not exceeding a kiloparsec in the source plane , a velocity gradient is often observed that reveals a disc - like rotating structure ; in most cases these give no evidence for recent mergers but the better resolution observations may display a clumpy structure of the source , possibly revealing the effect of merging : such is the case of sdp.81 , the best resolved of all cases .    in summary , understanding the genesis of early galaxies requires observations made at different stages of their evolution , in order to reveal the relative roles played by each actor as a function of time . at each stage ,",
    "multi - wavelength observations are mandatory in order to disentangle the respective morphologies of the gas and dust components and their locations with respect to the central supermassive black hole .    the next section , section 2 , recalls what is known of rx j0911 ; section 3 introduces the new observations and the reduction of the data , with section 4 discussing the relative positions of the quasar and the gas and dust components and section 5 discussing their sizes .",
    "section 6 locates the continuum flux measurement on the sed and section 7 discusses the line data .",
    "the article closes with a brief section summarizing its content and concluding .       taking all above considerations in due account",
    ", we therefore retain for the pdbi vs alma offsets ( offsets 3 ) the values @xmath340 mas and @xmath480 mas .",
    "they are 0.6@xmath5 and respectively 1.5@xmath5 away from zero : it is therefore reasonable to accept that our approach is sensible and use these quantities as evaluations of small positioning errors . using the alma frame as reference ( because it is the most accurately positioned ) reduces offsets 1 and 2 to common mean values of @xmath2122 mas in @xmath6 and @xmath2138 mas in @xmath7 , again compatible with the positioning errors to be expected from the hst ."
