    "gaussian interference channel ( gic ) models a communication scenario where the received signal is not only subject to gaussian noise but also the interference coming from other transmissions . despite its simple form ,",
    "the capacity region of the 2-user gic is unknown except for some special cases such as the strong interference regime @xcite .",
    "additionally the sum capacity in the noisy regime was derived concurrently in @xcite@xcite@xcite . for a general 2-user gic the best achievable rate region",
    "is given by the han - kobayashi ( hk ) scheme @xcite where the information is split into common and private components .",
    "however the computation of the general hk rate region is very difficult due to a large degrees of freedom involved and the lack of knowledge of the optimal input distribution . nevertheless in @xcite etkin ,",
    "tse and wang showed that a gaussian - input hk scheme without time sharing , where the power of the private information is set to the noise level , suffices to achieve the capacity region of a 2-user gic to within one bit .",
    "notably all the aforementioned capacity results reside on the class of simple hk schemes ( gaussian inputs , no time sharing ) with different power splitting .",
    "when one is interested in a @xmath0-user gic ( @xmath2 ) , it is tempting to consider the generalization of the simple hk scheme in a @xmath0-user setup .",
    "unfortunately the simple hk scheme is generally insufficient .",
    "as shown in @xcite it does not achieve the degree of freedom of a many - to - one gic , a special case of a general @xmath0-user gic . in this paper",
    ", we seek to find a subclass of a general @xmath0-user gic where a simple hk scheme achieves the sum capacity .",
    "motivated by the fact that the sum capacity of a 2-user one - sided gic ( here we refer it as gaussian z - interference channel or gzic ) is known for all channel conditions @xcite , we consider the generalization of the channel model to the @xmath0-user case .",
    "each user , except for the first interference - free user , experiences only one interference component coming from the previous user .",
    "hence every two adjacent users form a gzic and all the gzics connect in a cascade fashion shown in fig .",
    "[ chnfig ] ( in section ii ) .",
    "we refer this channel as cascade gaussian z - interference channel ( cgzic ) . for a physical interpretation , consider a wyner cellular network @xcite where the base stations are linearly aligned and each base station serves one user , which is located at the edge of the cell as shown in fig .",
    "[ wynercell ] .",
    "the @xmath0-user cgzic models the downlink channel of such network .     is associated with base station @xmath3 .",
    "only the interference coming from the nearest non - intended base station is considered .",
    "interference links are denoted by dashed lines.,width=302 ]    in this paper , we first obtain the sum rate optimal power splitting within a class of simple hk schemes assuming gaussian inputs and no time sharing . we show that there is no need for information splitting and each user transmits either common or private information depending on a recursively - defined channel condition . then for a 3-user cgzic , by providing upper - bounds , we present the sum capacity results in various regimes . for a modified noisy regime , a class of mixed regimes and the strong interferece regime , the exact sum capacity is derived . for a different class of mixed regimes , the sum capacity to within 0.5 bits",
    "is derived .",
    "all of the achievable schemes are based on the above optimized simple hk scheme .",
    "the generalization to the @xmath0-user case ( @xmath4 ) is also discussed .    in related work @xcite ,",
    "zhou and yu considered a similar channel model named cyclic gic where the etkin - tse - wang scheme was shown to achieve the capacity region to within some constant number of bits in the weak interference regime .",
    "the cgzic considered in this paper is a special case of a cyclic gic , where one interference link is removed . in return , the simplified model allows us to obtain stronger results in terms of rate sum .",
    "in particular , the optimized simple hk scheme proposed in this paper achieves a higher sum rate than the etkin - tse - wang scheme when applied to the cgzic .",
    "furthermore we are able to obtain the exact sum capacity in some regimes , as opposed to the approximation approach taken in @xcite .",
    "also the simplified channel allows us to obtain capacity results in a broader range of channel conditions .",
    "this paper is organized as the follows .",
    "section ii formally defines the channel model . for a class of simple hk schemes ,",
    "the maximum sum rate is derived in section iii .",
    "section iv presents the sum capacity results for various regimes and section v concludes the paper by illustration and discussion .    _",

    "@xmath7 denotes @xmath8 . whenever we write @xmath9 , the subscript g is used to denote that the distribution is gaussian .",
    "@xmath10 denotes differential entropy .",
    "the logarithms are in base 2 .",
    "we consider a general @xmath0-user cgzic with arbitrary channel coefficients and noise variances , which can be transformed into the standard form shown in fig . [ chnfig ] , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the i.i.d .",
    "real gaussian noise with zero mean and unit variance , i.e. @xmath13 . here @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the input and output of user @xmath3 respectively .",

    "receiver @xmath3 produces an estimate @xmath21 of message @xmath22 based on the channel output @xmath23 via a decoding function .",
    "rate tuple @xmath17 is said to be achievable if there exits encoding and decoding functions such that for all @xmath24 , the average error probability of user @xmath3 @xmath25 , where the expectation is over all messages , approaches zero as @xmath18 approaches infinity .",
    "the capacity region is defined as the union of all achievable rate tuples .",
    "we define a class of simple hk schemes as the follows :    in a _ simple hk scheme _ , user @xmath3 , @xmath26 , employs a gaussian codebook and splits its power into two parts , the common @xmath27 and the private @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "receiver @xmath3 decodes the common part of the interference and its own signal jointly by treating the private part as noise .",
    "hence each scheme in the class is uniquely specified by the power splitting tuple @xmath30 .",
    "note that the simple hk scheme , of which the rate region for a given channel is solely determined by the power splitting tuple , is more tractable than the general hk scheme , where besides the power splitting , the characterization of the rate region also depends on input distributions and time - sharing .",
    "previous works summarized in the introduction have focused on tuning the power splitting of the simple hk scheme in such a way that the sum rate coincides ( within a constant gap ) with the upper - bound and therefore capacity results are obtained . in this section",
    "we maximize the sum rate of the simple hk scheme for a @xmath0-user cgzic . in the following section , we provide upper - bounds and establish capacity results .",
    "[ sumrate ] the maximum sum rate of a @xmath0-user cgzic under a class of simple hk schemes is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 and for @xmath33 , @xmath34 the optimal power splitting tuple is given by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is an arbitrary real number in the interval @xmath37 $ ] and @xmath38    suppose @xmath39 is a maximum sum rate achieving rate vector under a class of simple hk schemes .",
    "let @xmath40 be the corresponding power splitting tuple .",
    "now consider a new power splitting tuple @xmath41 where @xmath42 note that @xmath43 differs from @xmath44 only by the first element .",
    "let @xmath45 denote the rate vector associated with @xmath43 scheme .",
    "next we will show @xmath46 is at least as large as @xmath47 and hence @xmath43 is also sum rate optimal .",
    "then we can proceed repeatedly in a similarly fashion until all @xmath48 is updated according to ( [ splitting ] ) .",
    "now let @xmath49 and for @xmath33 , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is defined in ( [ effchnl ] ) .",
    "if @xmath52 , we argue that @xmath45 is achievable under @xmath43 , where @xmath53 we need to show that with @xmath43 and rates @xmath54 , receiver @xmath3 can reliably decode the signal sent from user @xmath3 for all @xmath26 . note that rate vector @xmath55 gives the sum capacity of a 2-user gzic when the power splitting @xmath56 is employed by user 1 @xcite .",
    "since @xmath57 , rate vector @xmath58 lies in the capacity region of the 2-user gzic formed by user 1 and 2 .",
    "hence decoding at receiver 1 and 2 will be successful . recall that @xmath43 and @xmath54 differ from @xmath44 and @xmath59 only by the first element respectively . under power",
    "splitting @xmath43 , receiver @xmath3 can reliably decode at the rate @xmath60 for @xmath61 , since we assume @xmath59 is achievable with scheme @xmath44 . by assumption @xmath62",
    ", we have @xmath63 .",
    "however , we also have @xmath64 since @xmath65 is the point to point capacity of user 1 . therefore @xmath66 .",
    "if @xmath67 , we argue that @xmath45 is achievable under @xmath43 scheme , where @xmath68 the decodability at receiver @xmath3 , @xmath69 can be shown using the above argument .",
    "now we consider the decodability at receiver 3 . for any @xmath67 and any decomposition @xmath70 , where the subscript @xmath71 denotes common / private information , we can always find @xmath72 and @xmath73 such that @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 . if receiver 3 can decode the common interference and its own signal at rates @xmath77 , which is true by the assumption that @xmath59 is achievable under @xmath44 , then rates @xmath78 are also decodable at receiver 3 for the same power splitting tuple @xmath79 employed by user 2 and 3 .",
    "therefore rate vector @xmath45 is achievable under @xmath43 scheme .",
    "again by assumption @xmath62 , we have @xmath80 .",
    "however , it is clear that @xmath81 gives the sum capacity of the 2-user gzic formed by user 1 and 2 .",
    "hence @xmath82 , i.e. @xmath43 scheme is sum rate optimal . note that the maximum sum rate achieving scheme may not be unique .",
    "nevertheless , since we seek to find one such scheme , we let @xmath66 and @xmath83 .",
    "we have shown that there exists a maximum sum rate achieving scheme satisfying the following conditions : @xmath84 since we have determined @xmath85 , we can safely remove user 1 from the system and focus on the remaining users with an additional rate constraint on @xmath86 .",
    "we can further drop this constraint by replacing user 2 s direct link by @xmath87 , @xmath88 . note that @xmath86 is upper - bounded by the point to point rate and @xmath89 , @xmath26 .",
    "now we are back to the problem for a @xmath90-user cgzic starting with user 2 with a modified direct link .",
    "we can apply this procedure repeatedly until all users are considered .",
    "notice that since user @xmath0 does not cause interference to any other users , there is no constraint on the power splitting user @xmath0 adopts .",
    "in this section , we consider a 3-user cgzic and present capacity results in various regimes .",
    "extension to the @xmath0-user case is discussed in section v. one trivial result is that if there exists a very strong interference link , say @xmath91 , this interference link could be removed without affecting the capacity region and hence the sum capacity of a 3-user cgzic in this case reduces to the sum of a point to point awgn channel capacity and the 2-user gzic sum capacity . without loss of generality ,",
    "we assume no very strong interference link exists , i.e. @xmath92 for @xmath93 .",
    "[ defnoisy ] for a 3-user cgzic , we say the interference is _ noisy _ if the following condition is satisfied : @xmath94    the following result is a direct application of theorem 3 in @xcite to a 3-user cgzic .",

    "notice that condition ( [ noisy ] ) implies @xmath105 and @xmath106 . according to theorem [ sumrate ] , treating interference as noise at both receivers achieves the maximum sum rate of the simple hk scheme and corollary [ corollary ] shows that such sum rate is indeed the sum capacity .",
    "[ defstrong ] for a 3-user cgzic , we say the interference is _ strong _ if @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "[ strong ] the capacity region of a 3-user cgzic in the strong interference regime is given by the set of all nonnegative rate triples @xmath109 satisfying the following conditions for @xmath103 and @xmath110 : @xmath111    for the achievability , consider the simple hk scheme with power splitting tuple @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is arbitrary in the interval @xmath37 $ ] .",
