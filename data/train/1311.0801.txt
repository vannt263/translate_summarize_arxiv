    "robots with sizes comparable to bacteria could be useful for many biological research and medical applications  @xcite .",
    "such robots could act at locations specified to precision comparable to the size of individual cells , i.e. , several microns .",
    "these locations may only be recognizable once the robot is within several microns of the site , e.g. , particular receptors on cell surfaces . for such precise positioning",
    ", the robots will need to find and move to their target locations themselves .",
    "thus autonomous locomotion is a key capability for microscopic robots .",
    "locomotion of microscopic robots faces two major challenges .",
    "the first is identifying methods appropriate for the robots physical environment . at these sizes , viscous forces and brownian motion are significant  @xcite .",
    "thus the physics of microfluidics  @xcite require different locomotion methods than larger robots  @xcite .",
    "the second major challenge is fabricating the propulsion components and assembling them into complete robots .",
    "some fabrication techniques have been demonstrated for small robots in fluids .",
    "one example is propulsion by magnetic fields  @xcite , which can move microrobots containing ferromagnetic particles through blood vessels  @xcite",
    ". other demonstrated micromachines use flagellar motors  @xcite and cilia  @xcite .",
    "however , locomotion of these machines is externally controlled , e.g. , via magnetic fields or changing chemicals in the machine s environment , and thus do not provide autonomous locomotion .",
    "microorganisms use various locomotion mechanisms .",
    "a common method is moving extended structures , such as flagella and cilia  @xcite .",
    "these examples and current micromachines suggest flagella or cilia would be useful for robots .",
    "however , such appendages present significant fabrication and operational challenges for _ in vivo _   operation near cells and other robots .    the fabrication challenges for appendages include creating the active internal structures of flagella and cilia and assembling many cilia on the robot surface .",
    "a significant operational challenge is the potential for cutting nearby cells and tangling with nearby robots .",
    "moreover , appendages expose large surface area to the environment , which could lead to fouling or immune reaction . reliably avoiding these events",
    "significantly increases the complexity of the robot controller .",
    "if a robot needs to shut down ( e.g. , due to component failure ) , appendages could become tangled by subsequent passive motion in fluids or movement of nearby cells .    to avoid these challenges",
    ", this paper focuses on the feasibility of propulsion via motion of the robot s surface without extended appendages .",
    "while not as commonly studied as propulsion by flagella or cilia , some microorganisms move without using appendages  @xcite .",
    "two such methods are examined in this paper : steady surface motion that is flush with the robot surface and small - amplitude surface oscillations .",
    "this paper is a theoretical study of design trade - offs for robots that can not yet be manufactured .",
    "it extends previous models of microorganism locomotion by examining non - locomotion design constraints and potential implementations of these models for robots .",
    "these implementations allow estimating power dissipation inside the robots , which is usually neglected in studies of microscopic locomotion .",
    "the next section describes locomotion requirements and prototypical scenarios for microscopic robots in biological fluids . using these scenarios as examples , the following sections evaluate the two propulsion methods .",
    "section  [ sect.safety ] examines the safety of these methods .",
    "the following two sections discuss the effects of robot shape and brownian motion on locomotion .",
    "section  [ sect.design choice ] combines these discussions to describe design trade - offs among the propulsion methods .",
    "the final section summarizes the results and suggests directions for further study .",
    "this section discusses performance goals for locomotion , relevant tissue properties , and example scenarios .",
    "[ sect.performance ]    locomotion involves several performance measures  @xcite , and trade - offs among them .",
    "these include speed , maneuverability , and propulsive force .",
    "the maximum force depends on the strength of robot actuators and will generally be larger than the force required to move at the nominal locomotion speed .",
    "self - propelled robots will not necessarily need to move over long distances .",
    "injection or passive flow could get the robots within a few hundred microns of most cells in the body . or larger devices could carry the robots to the vicinity of their operating locations , which is particularly relevant for tasks involving machines operating cooperatively at various size scales in the same region ( e.g. , individual cells and the tissues they form )  @xcite . in such cases , autonomous",
    "locomotion need only enable robots to move about @xmath0 in a few minutes , which is a speed of about @xmath1 .",
    "similar speeds arise in moving through protective mucus layers to underlying tissue before the mucus layer is shed , carrying away any embedded robots .",
    "specifically , mucus layers range in thickness from tens to hundreds of microns and turn over in tens of minutes to hours  @xcite .    robots must move around obstacles .",
    "for example , a cell is about @xmath2 in size , so following a cell surface requires orientation changes of about @xmath3 after @xmath2 of movement .",
    "this takes about 10 seconds when moving at @xmath1 , i.e. , an angular rotation rate of about @xmath4 .",
    "these modest speed requirements leave ample design scope for other criteria , especially conservative designs emphasizing reliability and safety over maximizing performance .",
    "higher speeds extend the range of applications . for instance , blood flows in small vessels at speeds up to about @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "robots able to move faster than the flow could travel upstream , e.g. , to track chemical gradients extending downstream from a source on the vessel wall  @xcite .",
    "tasks needing higher speed even if possibly producing minor damage to tissue , e.g. , responding to acute injury  @xcite , are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the limited resources available to robots constrain their locomotion .",
    "one constraint is power , which robots may obtain in various ways  @xcite .",
    "for instance , isolated micron - size robots may obtain tens to hundreds of picowatts from oxygen and glucose in tissue  @xcite , though such power generators have not yet been experimentally realized . if the available power is insufficient for steady motion , the robot could move in bursts , accumulating fuel between these bursts or multiplexing movement with other tasks .",
    "another constraint is the robot s surface area .",
    "locomotion requires exerting forces against the fluid . in the absence of extended appendages",
    ", these forces must arise from motion of the robot surface .",
    "propulsion mechanisms must share the surface with other components , such as sensors and pumps .",
    "safe locomotion requires that the robots not significantly disturb nearby cells .",
    "disturbance can be direct , e.g. , due to collisions .",
    "the low speeds considered in this paper make collision damage to cells unlikely  @xcite .",
    "another direct effect is from stiff flagella cutting cells , which the methods discussed in this paper avoid by not using extended appendages . disturbance also arises indirectly from shear forces propagated through the fluid .",
    "a measure of this disturbance is the magnitude of fluid speed vs.  distance from a moving robot .",
    "smaller values mean less shear force on nearby cells , less drag from nearby walls and less hydrodynamic interaction among nearby robots , which could simplify controls .",
    "[ sect.power ]    locomotion has two contributions to power dissipation .",
    "first is the locomotion power , @xmath6 , dissipated through viscosity in the fluid .",
    "second is the dissipation , @xmath7 , within the robot to actuate the propulsion mechanism .",
    "the sum @xmath8 gives the power directly required for locomotion .",
    "additional losses within the robot , such as to control the motion or to generate and distribute power  @xcite are not considered here .",
    "external power use arises from the fluid flow around the moving object .",
    "a simple case is an externally forced spherical robot .",
    "specifically , stoke s law gives the force required to drag a sphere of radius @xmath9 at speed @xmath10 through an unbounded fluid of viscosity @xmath11 @xmath12 when the reynolds number , @xmath13 , is small , where @xmath14  is the density of the fluid .",
    "the power dissipated in the fluid is @xmath15 .",
    "conversely , for an arbitrary propulsion mechanism that moves the sphere at speed @xmath10 , applying an external force @xmath16 to the robot against the direction of the motion will stop the robot .",
    "thus eq .",
    "[ eq.stokes law ] estimates the thrust force of a propulsion mechanism capable of moving at speed @xmath10 .",
    "a common measure of locomotion effectiveness is its _ hydrodynamic efficiency _",
    "@xcite : the ratio @xmath17 of the power required for an external force to drag the object through the fluid to the power required for the object to propel itself at the same speed .",
    "hydrodynamic efficiency is typically a few percent  @xcite .",
    "studies of microorganism locomotion typically focus entirely on hydrodynamic efficiency .",
    "a full evaluation also accounts for power dissipated inside the robot .",
    "this is particularly important when hydrodynamic efficiency is large  @xcite so most of the power use arises from internal dissipation .",
    "internal dissipation depends on the details of the actuator mechanisms .",
    "various effects contribute to friction in micromachines  @xcite , depending on the microstructure of the surfaces , lubrication , applied forces and operating speeds .",
    "robots made of precisely structured , stiff materials could , in theory , be much more efficient  @xcite than current micromachines , in part due to avoiding viscous losses inside the robot by excluding fluid from the interior . in this case ,",
    "internal dissipation is primarily due to friction between moving actuators and their housings .",
    "smooth nanoscale surfaces separated by atomic - scale distances ( i.e. , a few tenths of a nanometer ) moving past each other at speed @xmath18 well below that of sound in the material have friction dominated by phonon scattering  @xcite .",
    "this leads to power loss @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the area of the moving surfaces and @xmath21 is a constant depending on the materials and their spacing . for stiff materials",
    ", @xmath21 is generally less than @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "we use this value for an upper bound estimate of internal power loss , i.e. , taking @xmath23 .",
    "thus , unlike the complexity of friction in micromachines with poorly defined geometry at nanometer scales , friction dissipation in smooth nanoscale surfaces has a simple dependence on area and speed .",
    "this allows estimating internal power dissipation for the implementations considered in this paper more readily than is possible for current micromachines .    for comparison , the viscous friction for flat surfaces moving past each other at speed @xmath18 while separated by a layer of fluid with viscosity @xmath11 and thickness @xmath24 is @xmath25 .",
    "this dissipates power @xmath26 , so @xmath27 .",
    "extrapolating to distances of a few tenths of a nanometer gives @xmath28 for fluids with viscosity similar to water .",
    "similarly , measurements of drag for micromachine rotors  @xcite gives @xmath21 of about this size . more precisely defined micron - scale surfaces can have lower friction  @xcite , but still significantly larger than the value of @xmath21 given above .",
    "thus the internal dissipation we consider , while achievable in principle , is several orders of magnitude smaller that of current micromachines .",
    "this lower friction is important for the feasibility of the propulsion mechanisms considered here , which might otherwise require more power than available to robots .",
    "fluid density and viscosity determine the nature of locomotion . in biological tissues , viscosity varies by orders of magnitude while density is roughly the same .",
    "thus as example scenarios we consider a wide range of viscosity but constant density . for the short distances we consider ( @xmath29 , about 5 to 10 cell diameters )",
    ", we assume a homogeneous fluid .",
    "specifically , these scenarios are moving in 1 ) a low viscosity fluid ( comparable to water ) at about @xmath30 , and 2 ) a high viscosity fluid @xmath31 times more viscous than water , which is a typical value for mucus or cell cytoplasm  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath6 is proportional to the product of viscosity and the square of locomotion speed , we consider a speed of @xmath1 in the high viscosity scenario to give the same value of @xmath6 for both scenarios .",
    "medical nanorobots could vary in size , from about one to tens of microns .",
    "mobile robots able to access individual cells will generally be small , e.g. , to allow passing through the smallest blood vessels and between or into cells .",
    "we focus on such sizes , i.e. , robots that are a few microns in size . robot shape also influences locomotion behavior .",
    "we mainly focus on spherical robots for simplicity .",
    ".scenarios corresponding to motion in low and high viscosity biological fluids .",
    "the low scenario corresponds to water and the high scenario to fluids @xmath31 times more viscous than water .",
    "values in the third column apply to both scenarios . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table.brownian motion ]    for self - propelled objects , a more significant effect is change in robot orientation as the robot moves . over times large",
    "compared to @xmath32 , random orientation changes lead to diffusive motion of self - propelled objects characterized by the motile diffusion coefficient @xmath33 where @xmath10 is the robot s speed  @xcite .",
    "table  [ table.brownian motion ] shows this diffusion is much more rapid than that due to translational diffusion .    on the other hand , for times comparable to or shorter than the orientation loss time @xmath32 ,",
    "locomotion remains predominantly in the original direction .",
    "this is the relevant case for motion over a few cell diameters , @xmath0 or so , or in very viscous fluids . in this regime ,",
    "the main effect of orientation loss is a limit on how far a robot can accurately navigate by dead reckoning .",
    "the root - mean - square ( rms ) angle change is @xmath34 in time @xmath35 , during which the robot moves distance @xmath36 .",
    "if the robot must reliably move distance @xmath24 with rms angle change at most @xmath37 , then it must move at least as fast as @xmath38 .",
    "one consequence of this constraint is an increase in energy required for smaller @xmath32 : power dissipation is proportional to @xmath39 while the time for the motion is @xmath40 , giving energy use proportional to @xmath10 . thus expending more energy on locomotion",
    "extends the useful range of dead reckoning .",
    "robot geometry significantly affects brownian motion .",
    "for instance , orientation time ( eq .  [ eq.orientation time ] ) increases rapidly with size , so even somewhat larger robots can more effectively use dead reckoning .",
    "robot shape is also important .",
    "[ fig.speed brownian motion ] shows an example with the same geometry constraints as in fig .",
    "[ fig.shape ] for an allowed change in orientation of @xmath41 rms over a distance @xmath42 .",
    "this gives a location error of order @xmath43 , i.e. , less than a typical cell diameter .",
    "elongated robots maintain direction for a longer time , thereby allowing them to meet the navigation requirement with slower motion .",
    "elongated robots also dissipate less energy , both internal and external , during the motion : the smaller dissipation of lower locomotion speeds more than compensates for the increased time to reach the location .",
    "thus choices of locomotion speed and robot shape can extend the applicability of dead reckoning navigation .     for robots shaped as prolate spheroids with the same volume and surface area used for non - propulsion components .",
    "the ovals are cross sections of the robots corresponding to three values of the semi - major axis indicated on the horizontal axis .",
    "the bands around the equatorial regions indicate the surface area devoted to propulsion . ]",
    "[ fig.speed brownian motion ]",
    "[ sect.design choice ]    this paper examines two propulsion mechanisms : steady tangential surface motion and periodic surface oscillations .",
    "this section discusses their relative merits .",
    "steady tangential surface motion can move the robot with large hydrodynamic efficiency and produce relatively high thrust and speeds compared to small amplitude oscillations .",
    "tangential motion does not change the robot s shape .",
    "this could be useful when operating in regions with rigid walls where changing shape , especially change in volume , could result in large pressure changes in the surrounding fluid .",
    "treadmills could move the robot over solid surfaces  @xcite in addition to movement in fluids , thereby providing operational flexibility .    in summary ,",
    "propulsion by steady surface motion is especially useful for tasks that 1 ) require fast or efficient locomotion , especially in highly viscous fluids , 2 ) operate in confined regions or alternate between moving in fluid and on solid surfaces , and 3 ) have significant available surface area to devote exclusively to propulsion .      forces applied within the robot can produce surface oscillations .",
    "thus other components , such as sensors , can use the same surface area that provides motion ( provided they function in spite of the oscillations ) .",
    "since oscillation amplitude is largest near the equator , less flexible components could be placed near the poles .    at higher frequencies",
    ", oscillations can perform functions such as sensing , navigation and communication  @xcite .",
    "thus an implementation that can operate at a wide range of frequencies can provide several functions .    with surface oscillations ,",
    "a spherical robot can alter direction simply by changing the oscillation pattern .",
    "this contrasts with steady motion implemented by treadmills or wheels in fixed orientation on the surface , which requires a separate step to rotate the robot .",
    "small - amplitude surface waves are likely easier to implement than methods requiring moving parts of the robot over long distances . in particular",
    ", oscillations avoid the need for watertight breaks in the surface .",
    "small - amplitude surface waves only slightly disturb surrounding fluid beyond a narrow boundary layer around the robot .",
    "robots may need to enter and move through the interior of cells  @xcite where propulsion methods with minimal disturbance may be particularly important to avoid damage .",
    "such intracellular motion would be autonomous extensions of inserting probes into cells , which do not appear to damage the cells even after several days  @xcite .    in summary , propulsion by small surface oscillations",
    "is especially useful for tasks that 1 ) require most of the surface area for other uses and hence have little area available for separate propulsion components ( without increasing the robot size ) , and 2 ) do not require fast or efficient locomotion",
    ".      having presented two propulsion methods for microscopic robots , this section illustrates the choice among these methods in the context of conservative design constraints that provide large safety margins .",
    "such choices are particularly appropriate for early use of robots with limited capabilities and which operate with significant uncertainties in the physical properties of their microenvironments and how cells respond to their motion .",
    "we consider the following design constraints .",
    "first , we allow up to @xmath44 for power dissipation , leaving most of the robot s available power ( i.e. , tens of picowatts ) for other tasks . for shear stress",
    ", we use the conservative limit from section  [ sect.safety ] of @xmath45 at a distance of @xmath46 from the robot .",
    "we compute this shear force based on the gradient in fluid velocity near the robot surface shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.fluid speed ] .",
    "we suppose robots use dead reckoning for navigation , with the example discussed in section  [ sect.brownian ] as the limiting constraint .    , shear stress @xmath46 from the robot surface of @xmath45 and brownian motion giving @xmath41 over a distance @xmath42 .",
    "surface oscillations satisfy all the constraints in the shaded area .",
    "the black dots indicate the scenarios of table  [ table.scenarios ] . ]",
    "[ fig.tradeoffs ]    fig .",
    "[ fig.tradeoffs ] illustrates design trade - offs from these constraints .",
    "the speed and viscosity values in the diagram cover much of the range relevant for _ in vivo _  operation .",
    "the locomotion speeds range from @xmath1 , allowing moving a few cell diameters in a minute , to @xmath47 , a conservative upper limit to avoid damage to cells from collisions with the robots  @xcite .",
    "the range of viscosities includes most biological fluids  @xcite , with water and blood plasma at the left , and cell cytoplasm on the right .",
    "the diagram shows power and shear stress limit operation in high viscosity fluids or at high speeds is less accurate  @xcite .",
    "corrections are not significant for this example since this portion of the diagram is outside the feasible operation range . ] .",
    "tangential motion is more efficient than surface oscillations , but also has larger shear stresses .",
    "brownian motion significantly affects navigation only for slower motion in low viscosity fluids . over most of the diagram ,",
    "power limits arise mainly from external fluid drag . only at the upper left ,",
    "i.e. , high speeds in less viscous fluids , do internal losses contribute noticeably .",
    "consequences of these limits depend on nanorobot task and operating environments .",
    "for instance , general purpose robots will operate at a wide range of speeds in fluids of various viscosities .",
    "propulsion by surface oscillations provide a range of possibilities satisfying these constraints ( shaded area in fig .  [ fig.tradeoffs ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", specialized robots could be optimized for a limited range of speeds and fluid viscosity .",
    "one such example is robots that move rapidly in small blood vessels , especially to move upstream against the flow , requiring speeds around @xmath48 but only in low viscosity fluids .",
    "another example is a robot needing to actively move only a few cell diameters away from capillaries over the course of several minutes , so speeds of @xmath1 or less are sufficient but the fluid may be highly viscous .",
    "[ fig.tradeoffs ] also shows that tasks requiring higher performance ( e.g. , high speed in viscous fluids ) will violate some of the constraints .",
    "for example , the robot could devote a more substantial fraction of its power to locomotion , thereby having less capability for other tasks , e.g. , communication or on - board computation to evaluate sensor readings .",
    "another example is moving slowly in low viscosity fluids which requires more complicated navigation than dead reckoning .",
    "elongated robot shapes improve power efficiency and reduce the effect of brownian motion , so are useful designs provided they satisfy geometric constraints , which are not included in fig .",
    "[ fig.tradeoffs ] .",
    "this discussion also does not include the maximum thrust force the robots could produce .",
    "[ sect.conclusion ]    this paper evaluated locomotion for microscopic robots in biological fluids . two appealing designs are steady tangential surface motion and periodic surface oscillations .",
    "both methods give speed and maneuverability sufficient for a variety of biomedical research , diagnostic and treatment applications .",
    "moreover , these designs allow devoting a significant fraction of the robot surface to other , non - propulsion devices , such as sensors .",
    "these locomotion methods produce relatively little disturbance of the surrounding fluid and avoid potential damage or tangling from using extended structures such as flagella .",
    "these features make locomotion compatible with other design goals , such as sensing , drug delivery and safety .",
    "furthermore , the machines will likely have more than enough power for these modes of locomotion .",
    "estimating internal power dissipation is challenging , both for microorganisms and robots , which leads most analyses of locomotion to focus on hydrodynamic efficiency .",
    "for microscopic robots made of precise , stiff materials , sliding friction dominates internal power dissipation , which allows rough estimates of internal dissipation . including these estimates with the power evaluation emphasizes different designs than a focus on hydrodynamic efficiency alone would suggest .",
    "in particular , when considering robot shape , internal dissipation limits the benefit of increasingly elongated shapes .",
    "a robot could have multiple locomotion modes for redundancy and operation in different environments .",
    "for instance , a robot could use treadmills for high - efficiency in fluids far from cells where damage to membranes is not an issue , and oscillating surfaces for locomotion near or within cells .",
    "the implementations discussed in this paper focus on the surface components , which directly interact with the fluid , i.e. , treadmills , wheels and oscillating surfaces .",
    "robots need additional components to produce and control these surface motions .",
    "thus a question for future study is designing and evaluating these components .",
    "one important property of these components is their energy dissipation .",
    "another important property is their failure rates  @xcite , which determine long - term reliability  @xcite and hence the redundancy required to have high confidence that robots can complete their tasks .",
    "reliable locomotion of _ in vivo _",
    "nanorobots require controls  @xcite suited to the millisecond time and micron space scales of robot motion .",
    "these controls include both individual robot behavior  @xcite and coordinated behaviors of multiple nearby robots ( e.g. , swarms ) due to hydrodynamic interactions  @xcite .",
    "sensors for the status of propulsion components can help ensure safe operation and aid locomotion control .",
    "such sensors include measuring the speed of propulsion components on the robot surface and forces on those components  @xcite .",
    "unusual speeds or forces could indicate component failure or that the robot is stuck .",
    "the controller could respond to avoid damage to the robot or its surroundings by either fixing the problem ( e.g. , deactivating out - of - spec propulsion components ) or , as a last resort , placing the robot in a passive `` safe mode '' .",
    "a potential problem with rapidly moving components is whether they make the robot as a whole resonate , thereby building up large and potentially destructive oscillations . as an estimate of relevant resonant frequencies , consider a piston with stiffness @xmath49 and mass @xmath50 for a cubic micron nanorobot as typical of proposed materials for microscopic robots .",
    "the lowest resonant frequency is @xmath51  @xcite .",
    "this is much larger than the propulsion frequencies we consider , so resonances from locomotion in micron - scale robots are unlikely .",
    "fabrication of complex structures with stiff materials may be able to create other propulsion methods , including jets with the possibility of arbitrarily small disturbance to the surrounding fluid  @xcite , propellers  @xcite , acoustic streaming  @xcite , and moving extended structures such as flagella and cilia .",
    "for example , flagella consisting of stiff , telescoping rods could reduce drag , compared to similar microorganism propulsion , by retracting the rod during the recovery stroke , and simultaneously reduce the opportunities for tangling or damaging nearby cells .",
    "the analyses in this paper focus on steady locomotion in simple , unbounded fluids with fixed properties on the scale of the robots .",
    "only variation due to large differences in fluid viscosity are considered in this paper .",
    "important extensions beyond this setting include motion in biological tissues with significant viscoelasticity  @xcite , and motion through small spaces , e.g. , through narrow channels within bone , where boundary effects are significant  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the viscosity of some biological fluids can vary significantly with the size and surface coatings of objects in those fluids  @xcite .",
    "robots may be able to exploit these effects to improve locomotion by , for example , harnessing interactions with nearby boundaries  @xcite or tuning size and surface properties to minimize viscosity as proposed for engineering nanoparticle - based drug delivery  @xcite .",
    "another extension is moving in bursts , which could use more power than available for steady motion , hence achieving higher speeds or forces .",
    "this could be especially useful for operating in very viscous fluids .",
    "biological tissues vary at both large and small space and time scales in response to environmental signals .",
    "feedback control can allow robots to compensate for such changes .",
    "moreover , robots could initiate such changes through active signaling to alter the robot s environment as it moves .",
    "for example , the propulsion mechanism can apply mechanical forces on individual nearby cells .",
    "alternatively , the robot could release chemical signals from onboard storage tanks . a potential application for such signals is moving between cells forming the boundary of tissues , such as blood vessel walls , without damaging cells , by signaling them to change adhesive forces , similar to signals used by white blood cells to exit vessels  @xcite .",
    "robots could act together to produce larger mechanical forces or chemical concentrations than a single robot .",
    "such coordinated activity includes creating patterns of forces on cells over extended periods of time , which can change the cell arrangement and function  @xcite .",
    "future evaluation of these questions will clarify locomotion design trade - offs for microscopic robots .",
    "fabrication of such robots involve significant technological challenges .",
    "prior to the feasibility of such fabrication , theoretical studies , such as presented in this paper , quantify likely nanorobot capabilities and their suitability for various applications .",
    "in particular , the evaluation of locomotion options provides guidelines for designs and indicates alternative implementations providing the same capabilities .",
    "this variety of options suggests microscopic robots will have several feasible locomotion methods ."
