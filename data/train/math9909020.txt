    "for @xmath0 a closed surface and @xmath1 two regularly homotopic generic immersions , we are interested in the number mod 2 of quadruple points occurring in generic regular homotopies between @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",

    "@xmath577 is a punctured torus , and so @xmath578 is a circle separating @xmath0 into two subsurfaces @xmath579 of smaller genus than @xmath0 and with @xmath580 . if @xmath231 is separating , then a nearby parallel circle @xmath213 will again separate @xmath0 in this way .",
    "now @xmath20 needs one additional generator .",
    "choosing any separating circle @xmath213 in @xmath0 there is clearly an orientation reversing @xmath6 which preserves the two sides of @xmath213 and which induces the identity on @xmath208 and so @xmath393 . and so finally we have a set of generators for @xmath20 , each of which ( except for the @xmath203-map ) preserves such a separation of @xmath0 by a circle @xmath213 into @xmath579 of smaller genus .",
    "let @xmath581 . slightly diminishing @xmath579 to be the components of @xmath582 , we may still assume @xmath583 , @xmath201 .",
    "since @xmath213 is separating in @xmath0 , @xmath584)=0 $ ] and so @xmath585 is regularly homotopic to a standard embedding of @xmath346 , in the shape of a thin tube . by means of [ s ] ( namely the proof of theorem 2.1 )",
    "we may extend such a regular homotopy of @xmath346 to the whole of @xmath0 .",
    "we now stretch this tube to be very long , at the same time pulling @xmath586 and @xmath587 rigidly away from each other until they are disjoint .",
    "see fig . f9a . by taking a smaller @xmath346 if necessary",
    ", we may assume @xmath588 is disjoint from @xmath589 , fig . f9b . by lemma bb",
    ", we may assume that this is in fact our immersion @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath590 be the closed surfaces obtained by gluing a disc @xmath591 to @xmath592 and let @xmath593 be an extension of @xmath594 .",
    "if the tube @xmath588 is very thin , then there is also a naturally defined extension @xmath595 of @xmath596 .",
    "we may further assume that the thin ball @xmath39 in @xmath349 which is bounded by the sphere @xmath597 , is disjoint from @xmath589 .",
    "since @xmath598 preserves @xmath599 then @xmath600 preserves @xmath601 .",
    "it follows that there is a regular homotopy @xmath382 between @xmath602 and @xmath603 .",
    "we perform @xmath604 and @xmath605 inside disjoint balls , and we let the thin tube @xmath346 be carried along . if we make sure no quadruple points occur in @xmath606 and @xmath607 , and the thin tube @xmath346 does not pass triple points , then the regular homotopy @xmath372 induced on @xmath0 in this way will have the sum of the number of quadruple points of @xmath604 and @xmath605 .",
    "now if @xmath10 is orientation preserving then so are @xmath600 , in particular @xmath608 is orientation preserving .",
    "so if we had carried the thin ball @xmath39 along with the tube @xmath346 , then it would now approach the @xmath591s from the same side it had for @xmath2 .",
    "and so we may continue the regular homotopy on the tube @xmath346 , still not passing through triple points , and cancelling all knotting by having the thin tube pass itself , until it is back to its original place , and this will not contribute any quadruple points .",
    "however , the new embedding of @xmath346 may differ from @xmath609 by some number of dehn twists as in fig .",
    "we may resolve this by rigidly rotating say @xmath586 around the axis of the tube .",
    "if on the other hand @xmath10 is orientation reversing , then after applying @xmath604 and @xmath605 and carrying the tube along , the thin ball @xmath39 will approach both @xmath591s from the wrong side . and",
    "so after we cancel all knotting , the tube @xmath346 will be as in fig f9d .",
    "f10 presents a regular homotopy that resolves this , and has @xmath512 quadruple points .",
    "f10a depicts the relevant part of fig .",
    "f9d , where the regular homotopy will take place . fig .",
    "f10a@xmath544b@xmath544c is a regular homotopy with no singular occurrences , or alternatively may be thought of as an ambient isotopy of @xmath349 .",
    "it shows that we may view the immersion of @xmath346 as a sphere with two rings facing outward , each of which has a tube attached to it .",
    "we now perform a @xmath39 move which joins the two rings into one ring with two tubes attached to it , fig .",
    "f10c@xmath544d . again by ambient isotopy , the ring may be brought to the equator , fig .",
    "finally we exchange the northern and southern halves of the sphere , arriving at an embedding , fig .",
    "this regular homotopy involved a @xmath39 move and a portion involving only double curves , and so indeed it had @xmath512 quadruple points .",
    "we then continue to bring @xmath346 back to place . as",
    "above , the new embedding of @xmath346 may differ from @xmath610 by some number of dehn twists , and those may be cancelled by rigidly rotating @xmath586 .    we have thus constructed a regular homotopy between @xmath2 and @xmath7 such that the number mod 2 of quadruple points , is the sum of the number occurring in the @xmath611s in case @xmath10 is orientation preserving , and the sum plus 1 , in case @xmath10 is orientation reversing .",
    "in other words @xmath612 . by the induction hypothesis , @xmath613 , @xmath201 .",
    "let @xmath614 and notice @xmath615 , @xmath616 and @xmath617 and so @xmath618 . so finally : @xmath619 .",
    "we now deal with the special @xmath203-map generator which appears when @xmath576 .",
    "since @xmath451 , then by theorem pi1(2,3 ) and lemma bb as before , we may assume @xmath2 is an embedding whose image is two embedded tori connected to each other with a tube , and such that a half revolution around some line in @xmath349 maps @xmath406 onto itself and interchanges the two tori .",
    "let @xmath6 be the map such that @xmath7 is the final embedding of this half revolution , then @xmath10 is orientation preserving and so @xmath620 .",
    "take a circle @xmath213 in one of the tori with @xmath584)=1 $ ] , then @xmath621 lies in the other torus , and so @xmath214\\neq h_*([c])$ ] and @xmath214\\cdot h_*([c])=0 $ ] .",
    "it follows that @xmath214 $ ] and @xmath622)$ ] are not in the same @xmath147 of the definition of @xmath203-map , so @xmath9 must be a @xmath203-map , and so @xmath10 is indeed a @xmath203-map on @xmath0 . since @xmath623 then by lemma pum , @xmath624 and so @xmath625 . since there is a rigid rotation between @xmath2 and @xmath7 , @xmath626 .",
