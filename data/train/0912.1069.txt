    "in 1938 shapley reported the discovery of a stellar system of previously unknown type in the constellation of sculptor @xcite .",
    "his preferred interpretation of the system was as `` a super cluster of the globular type '' , an interpretation given credence by the subsequent identification of ` cluster - type ' variables ( now generally known as rr lyrae variables ) in the system by @xcite .",
    "we now know this stellar system as the sculptor dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxy , an example of what is perhaps the most common type of galaxy in the universe . in the intervening 70 or more years",
    "we have learned much about the stellar populations of dsph galaxies , and have recognised that they are generally much more complex than the ( relatively ) simple stellar populations of globular clusters .",
    "one feature , however , is common between globular clusters and dwarf galaxies of all types , at least as far as local group objects is concerned .",
    "this is the existence in all dwarf galaxies where adequate data are available of a stellar population that is comparable in age to that of the galactic halo globular clusters . in other words , while the subsequent star formation history varies strongly from dwarf to dwarf , it appears for local group systems at least , that star formation did occur at the earliest epochs in all systems  there are no local group dwarfs known to lack ancient stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the most definitive indicator of the presence of an ancient stellar population , which we take as one with an age comparable to the oldest galactic halo globular clusters , is the observation of a faint main sequence turnoff luminosity .",
    "while with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ it is possible with long total exposure times to reach fainter than the ancient main sequence turnoff luminosity in dwarf galaxies even at the edge of the local group ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is frequently easier to characterise the presence of an ancient stellar population by confirming the existence of brighter markers .",
    "foremost of these are blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars and rr lyrae variables ( rrls ) , stars which are found only in ancient stellar populations .",
    "for example , we note that for the 14 galactic globular clusters with [ fe / h ] @xmath0 1.4 on the @xcite scale that are classified as `` old '' in @xcite , the median horizontal branch type @xcite ( b - r)/(b+v+r ) is 0.90 , i.e. , a horizontal branch morphology strongly dominated by bhb stars .",
    "@xcite show that the clusters in their `` old '' group have a small intrinsic age dispersion ( @xmath10.4 gyr ) and have ages consistent with formation in the epoch before reionization .",
    "we take the latter to be for @xmath2 @xmath3 6 , corresponding to age @xmath3 12.7 gyr for the standard concordance cosmology ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "further , the _ youngest _ star cluster known to contain rrls is the smc globular cluster ngc  121 , which has an age of 11.2 @xmath4 0.5 gyr @xcite corresponding to a formation redshift @xmath2 @xmath5 3 , i.e. , post reionization .",
    "however , many of the `` old '' clusters of @xcite also contain rrl stars .",
    "do dwarf galaxies beyond the local group contain ancient stars ?",
    "while many color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) exist for dwarf galaxies beyond the local group ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the currently available observations generally do not reach faint enough to reveal the definitive markers of an ancient population .",
    "such cmds do reveal well developed metal - poor red giant branches ( rgbs ) but without using additional constraints , such as the presence , number and magnitude range of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars more luminous than the rgb tip , the rgb stars could be between @xmath12 and @xmath310 gyr old .",
    "the question is not a trivial one as it involves the extent to which star formation occurs in low mass halos ( m @xmath6 10@xmath7 m@xmath8 ) at the earliest times , i.e.  before reionization , in environments different to that of the local group .",
    "the nearest group of galaxies beyond the local group is the sculptor group , which is a loose collection of late - type spirals and dwarf galaxies spread out along the line - of - sight with distances ranging from @xmath11.5 to 5 mpc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are 6 early - type dwarf systems identified as group members : the ds0/im ngc  59 and the less luminous systems eso294 - 010 , eso410 - 005 , eso540 - 030 , eso540 - 032 and scl - de1 ( scl22 ) .",
    "of these latter 5 systems , all except scl - de1 have detectable amounts of hi @xcite and thus can be characterised as ` transition dwarfs ' , i.e. , intermediate between gas - rich dirr systems and gas - poor de / dsph galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "all five of these dwarfs are targets in our _ hst _ program ; here we discuss first results for the two nearer systems eso294 - 010 and eso410 - 005 . using the apparent magnitudes listed in @xcite and the distance moduli derived below , these galaxies have m@xmath9 @xmath5 11.0 and 11.6 , respectively . as such they are comparable to local group dwarfs such as and  i ( m@xmath9 @xmath5 11.2 ) and leo  i ( 11.1 ) @xcite .",
    "observations of eso294 - 010 and eso410 - 005 were taken in may 2006 with the wide field channel ( wfc ) of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on board _",
    "hst_. both dwarfs fit comfortably within the wfc field - of - view .",
    "for eso294 - 010 the total integration time was 13920 sec in the @xmath10 filter ( ` wide-@xmath11 ' ) spread over 12 cr - split pairs of exposures , executed as 3 blocks of four .",
    "the interval between the first and last observations was 1.86 days .",
    "for the @xmath12 filter ( @xmath1@xmath13 ) the total integration time was 27840 sec over 24 cr - split pairs of exposures , executed as 6 blocks of four and spanning a range of 1.60 days .",
    "the individual blocks of four cr - split exposures were taken within a single visit using the so - called `` parallelogram '' dither box pattern @xcite . for eso410 - 005",
    "the observations followed the same strategy , with total integration times of 13440 sec in @xmath10 and 26880 sec in @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath10 and @xmath12 observations were both taken over a span of 4.54 days .",
    "the primary images used for the analysis are the calibrated , geometrically corrected , and dither - combined _ _ drz _ images that result from the standard acs processing pipeline calacs @xcite .",
    "these images were analyzed with the point - spread - function ( psf ) fitting programs in the _ daophot _ and _ allframe _ packages ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the first step all the images for both filters were registered and combined together into a single deep image .",
    "this image was used to generate the star list that functioned as input to _ allframe _ , which was applied to the three _ _ drz _ @xmath10 and six _ _ drz _ @xmath14 images .",
    "the process was identical for both galaxies .",
    "the resulting photometry sets were then combined , and objects with large @xmath15 , sharpness parameter or photometric error purged from the lists . to bring the photometry on to the ground - based @xmath16 system we used the synthetic calibration equations of @xcite .",
    "the aperture corrections from the _ allframe _ photometry to @xmath17 aperture photometry were derived directly from the images , and we also applied the aperture corrections from @xmath17 to infinite aperture @xcite . charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) corrections were investigated ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but were found to be smaller than 0.01 mag for almost all stars brighter than @xmath13 @xmath5 27.5 mag and have been ignored .",
    "the final photometric catalogue contains 30411 sources in eso294 - 010 and 30960 sources in eso410 - 005 and the resulting cmds are shown in the panels of fig .",
    "[ 294-cmdfig ] .",
    "the cmds of eso294 - 010 and eso410 - 005 shown in fig .",
    "[ 294-cmdfig ] are dominated by rgb stars . in both cases",
    "the @xmath13 magnitude of the tip of the rgb , @xmath13(trgb ) , is well defined .",
    "application of standard sobel filter techniques to the @xmath13-band luminosity function of the red giant branch yields @xmath13(trgb ) = 22.45 @xmath4 0.07 for eso294 - 010 and 22.35 @xmath4 0.07 for eso410 - 005 . adopting reddenings",
    "@xmath18 of 0.006 and 0.014 mag from @xcite , respectively , and m@xmath19 = 4.05 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then yields distances of 2.0 @xmath4 0.1 mpc and 1.9 @xmath4 0.1 mpc for eso294 - 010 and eso410 - 005 , respectively .",
    "these values are in excellent accord with , for example , the distances tabulated in the ` extragalactic distance database ' compiled by @xcite . in determining these distances we have ignored any reddening internal to the dwarf galaxies .",
    "this is justified as follows : using the galactic neutral gas column density to reddening ratio given in , for example , @xcite or @xcite , and assuming neutral hydrogen column densities of @xmath15 @xmath20 10@xmath21 @xmath22 @xcite in the dwarfs , the implied internal reddening is less than 0.01 mag .",
    "the actual value is likely to be even lower given the low metallicities of these systems compared to the galaxy .    with the distance known we",
    "can then use a comparison of the red giant branch colors with either standard globular cluster giant branches ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or theoretical giant branches ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to estimate mean metallicities under the assumption that the stars on the rgb are predominantly old .",
    "this is reasonable given the relatively small number of ( intermediate - age ) agb stars above the rgb tip in both galaxies ( see fig .",
    "[ 294-cmdfig ] ) . applying the calibration given in @xcite for @xmath23 ,",
    "the dereddened color of the giant branch at m@xmath24 = 3.5 , which is based on the standard globular cluster giant branches of @xcite , the mean metallicities for eso294 - 010 and eso410 - 005 are @xmath25[fe / h]@xmath26 = 1.7 @xmath4 0.1 and 1.8 @xmath4 0.1 , respectively .",
    "these values agree well with the mean metallicities derived from using the 12 gyr , [ @xmath27/fe ] = 0 theoretical giant branches of @xcite , which give @xmath25[fe / h]@xmath26 = 1.6 @xmath4 0.1 and 1.7 @xmath4 0.1 , respectively .",
    "it is also apparent from the cmds of fig .",
    "[ 294-cmdfig ] that both galaxies contain populations of young blue main sequence stars , with that in eso410 - 005 apparently relatively stronger than that of eso294 - 010",
    ". the possible existence of young stars in these galaxies has been remarked on before @xcite .",
    "the existence of such stars is not surprising given that @xcite have demonstrated that eso294 - 010 and eso410 - 005 both contain modest amounts of neutral hydrogen gas , namely 3.0 @xmath4 0.3 @xmath20 10@xmath28 m@xmath8 for eso294 - 010 and 7.3 @xmath4 1.5 @xmath20 10@xmath28 m@xmath8 for eso410 - 005 .",
    "a full population synthesis analysis of the cmds and its implications for the star formation histories of these dwarf galaxies will be the subject of a future paper ( rejkuba et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .    within the context of the current paper , however , one of the most notable features of the cmds of fig .",
    "[ 294-cmdfig ] is the clear presence of bhb stars in both galaxies .",
    "while the cmds show that for both galaxies the majority of the core - helium burning stars lie in the red clump region , the existence of a sizeable population of bhb stars in these dwarf galaxies is undeniable .",
    "populations of these ancient stars are seen in the cmds of local group dwarfs , but the cmds of fig .",
    "[ 294-cmdfig ] are the first direct demonstration of the existence of bhb stars in dwarf galaxies beyond the local group .",
    "we note in particular that the bhb populations of the scl group dwarf galaxies in fig .",
    "[ 294-cmdfig ] appear relatively strong .",
    "for example , bhb stars are seemingly more frequent in the cmds for these transition dwarfs than in the cmds of the cetus dsph ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and the transition dwarf lgs  3 @xcite , and are comparable to that for the phoenix transition dwarf @xcite .",
    "detailed comparisons of horizontal branch structures , however , are postponed to a subsequent paper ( rejkuba et al .",

    "over - plotted in magenta are the candidate variable stars for each dwarf , which are strongly concentrated to the horizontal branch .",
    "[ 294-cmdfig ] , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]      the _ allframe _ photometry of the @xmath10 and @xmath12 image sets produces not only a combined magnitude for each object , but also a variability index , _ var _ , which is the ratio of the external to the internal errors .",
    "the external error is given by the frame - to - frame variation in the individual magnitude measurements while the internal error is dominated by the poission photon noise of the star and sky scaled by the gain of the detector .",
    "stars that truly vary over the epoch of the observations will have significant variability index values . in fig .",
    "[ 294-cmdfig ] we show as magenta points the 240 stars in the eso294 - 010 photometry list and the 182 stars in the eso410 - 005 list that satisfy _",

    "further , for both galaxies , all the candidates with @xmath13 @xmath6 26.1 have been investigated using the _ _ crj _ photometry ( see below ) and only those ( the majority ) exhibiting genuine periodic variability characteristics have been plotted .",
    "clearly most of the candidate variable stars are coincident with the horizontal branch in the galaxies .",
    "we note however , that identifying variables this way is unlikely to produce a complete set of variables , and that , because the individual @xmath10 and @xmath12 images were not obtained concurrently , the combined magnitude and colors from the _ allframe _ photometry will not represent the correct phase averaged magnitude and color of any variable star .",
    "this is the explanation for the large spread in the colors of the candidate variables at the magnitude of the horizontal branch .",
    "it also means that the location of the candidate variables above the horizontal branch in fig .",
    "[ 294-cmdfig ] are unlikely to represent their true phase - averaged location in the cmd .    nevertheless , the variable candidates at the magnitude of the horizontal branch are likely to be predominantly rrls .",
    "the more luminous candidate variables , on the other hand , probably consist of a mixture of bl  her stars , anomalous cepheids , pop  ii cepheids , and short - period ( p @xmath31 2 d ) classical cepheids all of which are found in local group dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "here we discuss only the rrl candidates , noting that the epoch span of the observations ( 1.9 d for eso294 - 010 , 4.5 d for eso410 - 005 ) makes deriving light curves for all but the shorter period variables , such as rrls , uncertain .",
    "while the _ var _ index from 3 epochs in @xmath10 and/or 6 epochs in @xmath12 is clearly capable of identifying candidate variables , the corresponding _ allframe _ photometry does not provide enough information for any light curve analyses .",
    "consequently , we have turned to the _ _ crj _ data products from the acs pipeline .",
    "these are the bias corrected , flat - fielded and cosmic - ray cleaned combinations of the two exposures from the cr - split pairs .",
    "these images have total exposure times of 1160 and 1120 sec for eso294 - 010 and eso 410 - 005 , respectively , and allow 12 distinct @xmath10 and 24 @xmath12 magnitude estimates .",
    "the psf - fitting photometry on these frames was carried out much in the same way as for the _ _ drz _ data , including the derivation of the aperture corrections and the calibration to the vegamag system ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the sets of 12 @xmath10 and 24 @xmath12 magnitudes were then compiled for a small sample from the list of rrl candidates in each galaxy .",
    "the candidates chosen for follow - up were primarily selected from those with relatively large _",
    "var_(@xmath10 ) values , as the errors on the individual magnitudes are smaller for @xmath10 and the amplitude of variation for an rrl is larger in this filter compared to @xmath12 .",
    "this process necessarily biases against the selection of type - c rrls which have smaller amplitude variations than type - ab stars . for each rrl candidate",
    "the sets of @xmath10 and @xmath12 magnitudes together with the mid - exposure heliocentric julian dates were fed separately into the phase dispersion minimization code ( _ pdm _ ) within iraf .",
    "the output from the two data sets was then compared .",
    "the comparison generally permitted an estimate for the variability period that was consistent with both the @xmath10 and @xmath12 data .",

    "the @xmath32 minimum generally coincided with the period estimate from the _ pdm _ analysis to within 0.01 d. in fig .",

    "the phased @xmath12 data for these stars are not shown but are consistent with the periods adopted from the @xmath10 data .",
    "the periods found lie in the range 0.51  0.64 d and the amplitudes are of order 1 magnitude consistent with the properties of type - ab variables .",
    "further , the mean magnitudes of the stars are consistent , assuming the distance moduli calculated from the i(trgb ) values , with absolute magnitudes m@xmath34 @xmath5 + 0.6 . _",
    "the stars are thus clearly rrl variables , the first such stars to be characterised beyond the local group_.     ( @xmath1@xmath11 ) light curves for example rr  lyrae stars in eso294 - 010 ( left column ) and in eso410 - 005 ( right column ) .",
    "the solid curves are the best fit to the observations using the type - ab @xmath11-band template light curves from @xcite for the period ( in days ) shown in each panel .",
    "there are 12 independent brightness measures for each star .",
    "[ lc_fig],scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "just as the existence of bhb and rrl stars in the old globular clusters of our galaxy requires significant star formation during the pre - reionzation epoch within the dark matter halos that merged to form the milky way , the existence of bhb stars and rrl variables in the sculptor group dwarf galaxies eso294 - 010 and eso410 - 005 suggests that star formation occurred at the earliest epochs in these systems as well , much as it also did in the local group dwarfs .",
    "the sculptor group , however , is a notably different environment from the local group  it is much less dense and lacks dominant galaxies in the way that the local group is dominated by m31 and the galaxy .",
    "indeed there is little evidence for much dynamical evolution in the group ; @xcite have shown , for example , that the outer disk of the late - type spiral ngc  300 continues for an unprecedented 10 radial scale lengths with no sign of any disturbance or truncation , in marked contrast to the situation for m31 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the local group .",
    "thus from a cosmological point - of - view our results suggest that gas can condense and form stars in low mass halos at the earliest epochs even in relatively low density environments .",
    "further , given the substantial number of red clump stars in the cmds , which are likely to have ages less than 10 gyr , it appears that the subsequent star formation in these dwarfs was not obviously affected by reionization .",
    "this is consistent with the observational results for local group dwarfs @xcite but inconsistent with theoretical results that predict post - reionzation star formation in dwarf galaxies should be strongly suppressed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
