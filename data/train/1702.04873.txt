    "many species of ants , bees , and wasps form highly complex eusocial societies characterized by dominance hierarchies and reproductive division of labor @xcite . in most cases , both the queen and",
    "the workers are capable of laying male eggs parthenogenetically , but the workers often forego their own reproduction , allowing the queen to produce the majority of drones @xcite .",
    "there are several ways in which this behavior could arise .",
    "one possibility is that a ` policing ' mutation acts in a worker , causing that worker to destroy male eggs produced by other workers @xcite . alternatively ,",
    "a ` non - reproduction ' mutation could act in a worker , causing that worker to forego its own reproduction @xcite .",
    "such mutations can spread and eventually fix in the population if the resulting gains in colony reproductive efficiency are sufficiently large @xcite . finally , and as the case we consider in this paper , a mutation could act in a queen , causing her to suppress her workers reproduction @xcite .",
    "there are several mechanisms by which a queen can manipulate her workers reproductive output .",
    "in small colonies , the queen or dominant individual can directly control worker reproduction by eating worker - laid eggs or by aggressing workers who attempt to lay eggs @xcite",
    ". indirect chemical suppression of worker reproduction is also possible through queen pheromones @xcite , which are especially important in species with large colonies , where direct queen policing is infeasible @xcite .",
    "pheromonal suppression by queens or dominant individuals has long been recognized in the eusocial hymenoptera @xcite .",
    "for example , queen tergal gland secretions @xcite and queen mandibular pheromone @xcite have both been shown to limit ovarian development in honey bee workers ( genus _ apis _ ) , while in the carpenter ant _ camponotus floridanus _ , worker - laid eggs experimentally marked with the queen - derived surface hydrocarbons were significantly less likely to be destroyed by other workers @xcite .",
    "pheromonal suppression of worker reproduction has also been documented in primitively eusocial species , including the polistine wasps _ polistes dominula _ @xcite and _ ropalidia marginata _",
    "@xcite , the euglossine bee _ euglossa melanotricha _",
    "@xcite , and several species in _ bombus _ @xcite .",
    "despite the ubiquity of the phenomenon , a rigorous theoretical understanding of the evolution of queen suppression of worker reproduction is lacking .",
    "what are the precise conditions under which queen control evolves ?",
    "what demographic and ecological characteristics of insect populations result in the evolutionary emergence of queen control ? to address these questions , we formulate a model of population dynamics that is based on haplodiploid genetics @xcite . in this model , we study the population genetics of alleles , dominant or recessive , that act in queens to reduce worker reproduction .",
    "we derive exact conditions for invasion and stability of these alleles , for any number of matings of the queen , and interpret these conditions in terms of the colony efficiency effects of suppressing worker reproduction .",
    "a related , longstanding debate in the literature concerns the nature of queen chemical suppression of worker reproduction in terms of workers ` evolutionary interests ' @xcite .",
    "should queen chemical suppression be interpreted as coercive control of workers ( against their evolutionary interests ) , or are these chemicals best thought of as honest signals of queen presence or fertility ( so that their induction of non - reproduction in workers can in fact be in those workers evolutionary interests ) ?",
    "empirical studies provide support for both interpretations @xcite .",
    "our setup , based on population genetics , offers a simple and attractive framework for classifying queen suppressor chemicals as either coercive or honest signals .",
    "suppose a queen suppressor mutation has fixed , so that all queens produce chemicals that suppress workers reproduction .",
    "now suppose that a ` resistance ' mutation arises that renders workers in whom it is expressed immune to queen suppressor chemicals , so that these workers again lay male eggs .",
    "if this ` resistance ' mutation invades , then resistance is seen to be in the workers evolutionary interests , and the initial queen suppression should be interpreted as coercive . if not , then we interpret the queen suppressor chemical to be an honest signal @xcite .",
    "invadability of the population by this rare ` resistance ' allele is equivalent to evolutionary instability of a non - reproduction allele acting in workers , the formal population genetical conditions for which are given in @xcite .",
    "we use these conditions to distinguish the demographic and ecological parameter regimes in which queen suppression should be thought of as coercion or as honest signalling .",
    "we also explore the similarly relevant possibility of partial queen control inducing complete worker sterility @xcite .",
    "we study queen control of workers in the context of haplodiploid sex determination , as found in ants , bees , and wasps .",
    "fertilized eggs ( diploid ) become females , and unfertilized eggs ( haploid ) become males .    a single gyne mates with @xmath0 distinct , randomly - chosen drones .",
    "she then founds a colony and becomes its queen ( figure [ fig : colonies](a ) ) .",
    "she fertilizes haploid eggs with the sperm from each of the @xmath0 males that she mated with to produce diploid female eggs .",
    "when these female eggs hatch , the resulting individuals become workers in the colony . in addition , the queen produces unfertilized haploid male eggs .",
    "workers can also produce haploid male eggs , leading to reproductive conflict over male production within a colony ( figure [ fig : colonies](b ) ) .",
    "we consider the evolutionary dynamics of two alleles  a wild - type allele , @xmath1 , and a mutant allele , @xmath2 .",
    "we use the following notation for individuals of various genotypes .",
    "there are two types of drones : @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "there are three types of gynes : @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "a queen s type ( or , equivalently , that of a colony , since each colony is headed by a single queen ) is denoted by @xmath6 ; @xmath7 ; or @xmath8 , depending on whether the queen s own genotype is @xmath3 , @xmath4 , or @xmath5 , respectively , and the number , @xmath9 , of mutant ( type @xmath2 ) drones she mated with , requiring @xmath10 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 to denote the frequencies of the colony types in the population , and we require that @xmath14 at all times .",
    "the mutant allele , @xmath2 , acts in a queen to alter her phenotype . if the mutant allele , @xmath2 , is dominant , then type @xmath6 queens are wild - type , while type @xmath7 and type @xmath8 queens have the mutant phenotype .",
    "if the mutant allele , @xmath2 , is recessive , then type @xmath6 and type @xmath7 queens are wild - type , while type @xmath8 queens have the mutant phenotype .    in colonies headed by wild - type queens ,",
    "a fraction @xmath15 of males are produced by the queen , and new gynes and drones are produced at rate @xmath16 . in colonies headed by queens with the mutant phenotype ,",
    "a fraction @xmath17 of males are produced by the queen , and new gynes and drones are produced at rate @xmath18 .",
    "thus , colonies headed by queens with the mutant phenotype have different values of the fraction of queen - produced males and colony efficiency@xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively  compared with colonies headed by wild - type queens .",
    "importantly , our mathematical analysis is robust .",
    "it does not make restrictive or nuanced assumptions about the underlying factors that influence the values of @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 in any particular case of interest .",
    "the values of the parameters @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 indeed result from interplay between many demographic and ecological factors .",
    "it is instructive to consider the relative values of these parameters in the context of a queen that influences her workers reproduction .",
    "we expect that @xmath23 ; i.e. , the effect of the queen s manipulation is to increase the fraction of male eggs that come from her .",
    "@xmath20 may be greater than or less than @xmath22 . if @xmath24 , then the queen s manipulation effects an increase in colony efficiency , while if @xmath25 , then the queen s manipulation effects a decrease in colony efficiency .",
    "the key question is : what values of the parameters @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 support the evolution of queen suppression of workers reproduction ? we derive the following main results .",
    "the @xmath2 allele , which causes the queen to suppress her workers reproduction , invades a population of non - controlling queens if the following condition holds : @xmath26 condition applies regardless of whether the queen - control allele , @xmath2 , is dominant or recessive .",
    "the evolutionary dynamics demonstrating condition for single mating and for a dominant queen - control allele are shown in figure [ fig : n1domsim](a ) .",
    "furthermore , the queen - control allele , @xmath2 , when fixed in the population , is stable against invasion by the non - controlling @xmath1 allele if the following condition holds : @xmath27 condition also applies regardless of whether the queen - control allele , @xmath2 , is dominant or recessive .",
    "the evolutionary dynamics demonstrating condition for single mating and for a dominant queen - control allele are shown in figure [ fig : n1domsim](b ) .    0.45    ) , and we set @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",

    "therefore , three scenarios regarding the two pure equilibria are possible : the first possibility is that queen control is unable to invade a wild - type population and is unstable , when fixed , against invasion by non - control .",
    "the second possibility is that queen control is able to invade a wild - type population but is unstable , when fixed , against invasion by non - control .",
    "the third possibility is that queen control is able to invade a wild - type population and is stable , when fixed , against invasion by non - control . in the case where queen control can invade a wild - type population but",
    "is unstable when fixed , brouwer s fixed - point theorem guarantees the existence of at least one mixed equilibrium at which controlling and non - controlling queens coexist .",
    "regions of the parameter space are shown in figure [ fig : regions ] , and evolutionary dynamics illustrating the three scenarios are shown in figure [ fig : regions_sim ] .     versus @xmath21 shows the three possibilities for the dynamical behavior of the queen - control allele around the two pure equilibria .",

    "first , the conditions for evolutionary invasion and stability of queen control do not depend on the queen s mating number @xmath0 . to develop intuition , consider the introduction of an initially rare dominant allele for queen control .",
    "when the allele is rare , for @xmath0 matings , @xmath39 colonies are more abundant than @xmath40 colonies by a factor of @xmath0 .",
    "a fraction @xmath41 of offspring of @xmath39 colonies arise from selecting sperm from wild - type males and are 100% wild - type , as though they had originated from @xmath42 colonies .",
    "however , the remaining fraction @xmath43 of offspring of @xmath39 colonies are produced in the same relative mutant / wild - type proportions as if they had originated from @xmath44 colonies .",
    "notice that the factor of @xmath0 from the matings cancels with the probability of @xmath43 of selecting sperm from the mutant male .",
    "therefore , we have a simple interpretation : for considering invasion of queen control , and at the leading - order frequency of the mutant allele , the system effectively consists of @xmath44 colonies and @xmath40 colonies at relative amounts that do not depend on @xmath0 .",
    "but @xmath44 colonies produce mutant and wild - type offspring in relative proportions that do not depend on @xmath0 , and @xmath40 colonies produce mutant and wild - type offspring in relative proportions that do not depend on @xmath0 .",
    "thus , @xmath0 does not enter into condition .",
    "second , queen control can evolve even if it results in efficiency losses . to see why , notice that , if the queen - control allele is dominant , then type @xmath40 colonies have the mutant phenotype , and if the queen - control allele is recessive , then type @xmath45 colonies have the mutant phenotype . in the dominant case ,",
    "workers in type @xmath40 colonies produce @xmath46 type @xmath1 males for every type @xmath2 male , but the queen produces type @xmath1 and type @xmath2 males in equal proportion . in the recessive case , workers in type @xmath45 colonies produce type @xmath1 and type @xmath2 males in equal proportion , but the queen produces only type @xmath2 males . in both cases , if the queen takes over production of males ( i.e. , if @xmath23 ) , then the frequency of the mutant allele in the next generation increases .",
    "thus , the allele for queen control can act as a selfish genetic element , enabling queen - induced worker sterility to develop in a population even if it diminishes colony reproductive efficiency .",
    "queens are easily selected to increase their production of male offspring and suppress workers production of male offspring . in this case , workers might also be selected to evade manipulation by queens , setting up an evolutionary arms race . when does queen control evolve and persist in the population ?    consider the following scenario .",
    "initially , there is a homogeneous population of colonies .",
    "all queens are homozygous for allele @xmath1 at locus @xmath47 , and all workers are homozygous for allele @xmath48 at locus @xmath49 . in each colony , the fraction of queen - derived males within the colony is @xmath21 , and the overall reproductive efficiency of the colony is @xmath22 .",
    "suppose that a mutation , @xmath2 , acts in a queen at locus _ a _ , causing her to completely suppress her workers production of drones . in colonies headed by controlling queens ,",
    "all males originate from the controlling queen ( @xmath29 ) , and the overall reproductive efficiency of the colony is @xmath20 . according to equations and , if @xmath50 is sufficiently large ( @xmath51/4 $ ] ) , then the controlling queens will increase in frequency and fix in the population .",
    "once the queen - control allele has fixed , each colony s male eggs originate only from the queen ( @xmath29 ) , and each colony has overall reproductive efficiency @xmath20 .    next ,",
    "consider a subsequent mutation , @xmath52 , that acts in workers at locus @xmath49 .",
    "the @xmath52 allele changes a worker s phenotype , causing the mutant worker to become reproductive again .",
    "the @xmath52 allele for worker reproduction can be either dominant , so that type @xmath53 and type @xmath54 workers are reproductive , or recessive , so that only type @xmath54 workers are reproductive @xcite .",
    "if a colony contains only workers with the reproductive phenotype , then the fraction of queen - derived males within the colony is @xmath21 , and the overall reproductive efficiency of the colony is @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the @xmath52 allele for worker reproduction essentially undoes the effects of the @xmath2 allele for queen control .",
    "what are the requirements for queen control to be evolutionarily stable against a mutation in workers that restores their reproduction ? to answer this question for a dominant @xmath52 allele",
    ", we turn to equation ( 53 ) in @xcite , which is the condition , for any number of matings , @xmath0 , for stability of a recessive mutation in workers that results in worker sterility : setting @xmath55 in equation ( 53 ) in @xcite , this condition becomes @xmath56 \\left [ 2\\left(\\frac{r'}{r_\\frac{1}{2}}\\right ) - 1 \\right ] > 1 \\label{eqn : resistance_rec_ster_sta}\\ ] ] in condition , @xmath57 is the colony reproductive efficiency when a fraction @xmath58 of workers are reproductive , @xmath59 is the colony reproductive efficiency when a fraction @xmath43 of workers are reproductive , and @xmath60 is the fraction of queen - derived males when a fraction @xmath43 of workers are reproductive .",

    "we have also studied the conditions under which selection subsequently favors genes that act in workers to resist queen control .",
    "the condition for evolutionary invasion and stability of queen control , condition , is always easier to satisfy than the conditions for subsequent worker acquiescence ; the former condition does not require colony efficiency gains to queen control , while the latter conditions do .",

    "there also exist regions of parameter space  where queen control invades and fixes , and where the conditions for worker acquiescence are satisfied  where evolved queen control can be thought of as honest signalling ( that is , in workers evolutionary interests ) .",
    "we have thus shown that , within the same simple setup , both coercive control and control via honest signalling are possible .",
    "this theoretical result is interesting in light of the continuing empirical debate over whether queen control represents coercion or signalling .",
    "many recent works have expressed disfavor toward the coercion hypothesis @xcite , but our results demonstrate that coercive control could have evolved often in the social hymenoptera .    the crucial consideration in our analysis is how the establishment of queen control changes the colony s overall reproductive efficiency .",

    "thus , stronger queen control is more susceptible to worker resistance , but it also more easily selects for worker non - reproduction .",
    "an understanding of the long - term evolutionary consequences of queen control must consider the specific types of mutations that act in workers and incorporate both of these effects .    in our analysis ,",
    "colony efficiencies with and without queen control were treated as static parameters . however , because queen control directly limits the workers contribution to the production of drones , it makes it beneficial for workers instead to invest their resources in colony maintenance tasks @xcite .",
    "therefore , colony efficiency could change if the evolution of queen - induced worker sterility is followed by the evolution of more efficient helping by workers @xcite . under this scenario ,",
    "it is possible that queen control establishes in a system where worker resistance is initially under positive selection ",
    "conditions and do not hold  but that subsequent efficiency gains by the now - sterile worker caste increase @xmath20 sufficiently that conditions and come to hold , so that worker resistance is no longer selected for .    our results facilitate a crucial connection with ongoing experimental efforts in sociobiology .",
