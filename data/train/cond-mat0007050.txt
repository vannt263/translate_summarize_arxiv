    "electron - phonons interactions have always attracted a lot of attention . indeed , they are responsible for a large number of phase transitions , such as bcs supra - conductivity or peierls transitions . among the materials for which electron - phonons coupling are important",
    ", molecular materials constitute a special class .",
    "a trivial statement is that molecular crystals differ from simple crystals by the fact that their basic units are molecules .",
    "these basic units are therefore structured systems with a large number of internal degrees of freedom that may interact with the valence or conduction electrons . in particular , molecular crystals have two kinds of electron - phonons interactions .",
    "the first one is inter - molecular and the phonons essentially couple to the electronic structure through a modulation of the hopping parameter between two molecular sites .",
    "this electron - phonons coupling is responsible for the peierls transitions and has been extensively studied .",
    "the second type of interaction is intra - molecular .",
    "the totally - symmetric molecular vibrational modes couple to the electronic structure , essentially through a modification of the on - site parameters such as molecular orbital energies and on - site repulsions . in the @xmath2 s ,",
    "little  @xcite suggested that intra - molecular vibrations could be responsible for supra - conductivity in organic conductors , more recently they were proposed as mediators for supra - conductivity properties in materials such as fullerides  @xcite .",
    "indeed in systems such as the organic conductors , there is a broad spectrum of intra - molecular vibrations ranging from @xmath3 to @xmath4  @xcite , that is between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the hopping inter - molecular integral responsible for the conduction .",
    "moreover it was shown that these vibrations couple quite well with the electronic degrees of freedom both in the hight and low vibrational range of the raman spectrum  @xcite .",
    "this fact can easily be understood from simple chemical considerations .",
    "indeed , the molecules acting as basic units in these systems share number of characteristics such are being large , strongly conjugated , and built from pentagonal cycles .",
    "these characteristics allow them to adjust their geometry to their electronic charge at a low energetic cost , essentially by a modification of the angles in the pentagonal cycles .",
    "this mechanism leads to an important electron intra - molecular vibration coupling .",
    "previous studies on correlated electronic systems coupled to intra - molecular vibrations have essentially explored the two asymptotic regimes , ( i ) the weak coupling regime  @xcite that can be treated by perturbative expansion from the electronic model and ( ii ) the strong coupling or polaronic regime  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the study of the intermediate coupling regime can not be done by analytic treatments and requires up to date numerical techniques .",
    "the purpose of this work is to fill this gap and systematically explore the phase diagram of a one dimensional , correlated , electronic system coupled to intra - molecular vibrations , both as a function of the coupling constant and the correlation strength .",
    "the present paper systematically studies the hubbard - holstein model for a one dimensional quarter - filled chain for two values of the vibration frequency , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively corresponding to the top and the bottom part of the organic conductors raman spectra . for each phase ,",
    "properties such as spin and charge gaps , distance dependence of the spin , charge and singlet correlation functions , etc , are reported .",
    "the next section analyses the hubbard - holstein model and develops the computational choices . the third section reports and discusses the results and the last section is devoted to the conclusion .",
    "the hubbard - holstein hamiltonian associates a hubbard hamiltonian , which includes short range electron correlations , with dynamical phonons .",
    "the latter are linearly coupled with the electronic degrees of freedom as in the holstein model  @xcite .",
    "@xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the usual creation , annihilation and number operators of electrons of spin @xmath14 on site @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) . @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the intra - molecular phonons creation and annihilation operators .    from the point of view of the isolated molecule the hubbard - holstein ( hh ) model tries to mimic the relaxation of the molecular geometry as a function of the ionicity .",
    "indeed the on - site part of the hh model can be rewritten as @xmath19 +       \\left(u - 2{g^2 \\over \\omega}\\right )      n_{i\\uparrow}n_{i\\downarrow } + n_i\\left(\\epsilon - { g^2 \\over \\omega }",
    "\\right ) \\label{eq : hi2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above formulation points out the three effects treated in the hh model .    1 .",
    "the modification of the molecular orbital energy : @xmath20 .",
    "this effect is very important ( i ) in multi - band systems since it strongly affects the relative filling in the different bands and ( ii ) in opened systems where electrons can jump in and out from an external bath . in our case",
    "it just changes the energy reference .",
    "the decrease of the effective on - site bi - electronic repulsion : @xmath21 . in the strong coupling regime",
    "the effective electron - electron interaction can become attractive due to the electron - phonons interaction , and two electrons held together via molecular vibrations . 3 .   the displacement of the harmonic oscillator describing the intra - molecular vibrations as a function of the molecular charge @xmath22 : @xmath23 \\longrightarrow \\omega \\left [ \\left ( b_{i}^{\\dagger } + n_i\\ , g/ \\omega \\right ) \\left(b_{i } + n_i\\,g/\\omega \\right ) + 1/2 \\right]$ ] .",
    "this term mimics the relaxation of the molecular geometry as a function of the molecule ionicity .",
    "the @xmath24 term acts as an effective molecular coordinate for which the equilibrium geometry is linearly shifted from @xmath25 , when the molecular site does not carry any electron , up to @xmath26 , when it carries @xmath27 electrons .",
    "one sees from equation  [ eq : hi2 ] that the vibronic molecular states are coherent phonons states , eigenstates of the shifted harmonic oscillators .",
    "they can be referred as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the vibrational quantum number of the molecule @xmath15 when it supports @xmath22 electrons , @xmath30    @xmath31 is the dirac function .",
    "the calculations on the infinite chain are performed using the infinite system density matrix renormalization group method  @xcite .",
    "the main problem risen by the hh model is the infinite number of vibronic states on each sites . in order to render the calculations feasible ,",
    "the basis set have been truncated to the lowest vibronic states of each molecular site , that is @xmath32 such that @xmath33 .",
    "this choice is physically reasonable since ( i ) we work at @xmath34 and therefore only the lowest vibronic states are expected to be involved , ( ii ) the molecules form well defined entities that are only perturbatively modified by the presence of their neighbors .",
    "the drawback of this choice is that we directly work in the vibronic basis set and the truncation of the basis set destroys any further possibility to separate the electronic degrees of freedom from the vibrational ones .",
    "we will see later , from a wave function analysis of the different phases , that the truncation does not affect the results of our calculations as long as we are not too close to a phase transition .    in the phase diagram explorations we kept 100 states per renormalized block , while in the properties calculations 256 states were kept .",
    "the charge and spin gaps where computed using a double extrapolation ( i ) on the system size and ( ii ) on the number of states kept @xmath35 .",
    "typically the extrapolations over @xmath35 were done from three dmrg calculations with respectively @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 states kept .",
    "the maximum number of sites is @xmath39 and the correlation functions presented below are done for this chain length . in some cases , exact diagonalizations on small clusters have also been performed in order to better analyze either the wave function or the energy spectrum .",
    "the present work explores in a systematic and unbiased way the whole range of electron - phonons coupling regime ( from @xmath40 to @xmath41 ) as well as the whole range of correlation strength ( from @xmath42 to @xmath43 ) , for two values of the phonons frequency : @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "these frequencies have been chosen in order to approximatively correspond to the low and high part of the raman spectrum of the @xmath46  @xcite , @xmath47  @xcite or @xmath48  @xcite molecules .",
    "the adiabatic regime corresponds to the parameter domains @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and the strong coupling regime corresponds to @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "figure  [ fig : diagph02 ] reports the phase diagram for @xmath54 as a function of @xmath55 and @xmath56 which are , with @xmath57 , the three relevant parameters in the hh model ( see eq .  [ eq : hi2 ] ) .",
    "five different phases have been characterized : two insulating phases where the electrons are strongly localized , a polaronic phase ( diamonds ) and a bi - polaronic phase ( circles ) and three metallic phases ( crosses , stars and plus ) .",
    "these phases were characterized using the following set of tools + ( i ) the variation of the energy with the number of sites , + ( ii ) the spin and charge gaps , + ( iii ) the spin , charge and singlet - singlet correlation functions , + ( iv ) density matrices at the central sites .      in the strong coupling regime , @xmath58 becomes negative and a bi - polaronic phase was found .",
    "as expected , the attractive character of @xmath59 strongly couples the electrons in pairs .",
    "for instance , for @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath39 sites ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 ) , the probability of having a lonely electron on the central site is smaller than @xmath64 .",
    "the electron pairing induced by the intra - molecular vibrations is very strong , however , due to the franck - condon factors , this phase does not correspond to the singlet super - conducting phase but rather to a localized bi - polaronic phase .",
    "let us suppose that an electron on a site @xmath15 would like to hop on a neighboring @xmath65 , omitting the spin degree of freedom the hopping term can be written as latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }   a^\\dagger_{j}a_{i } \\ ;    t \\",
    ", |n_i-1,\\nu_\\alpha^{n_i}\\,;\\,n_j+1,\\nu_\\beta^{n_{j}}\\rangle \\\\ & = & t \\ , \\sum_{\\gamma,\\delta }   \\langle \\nu_\\alpha^{n_i } | \\nu_\\gamma^{n_i-1}\\rangle \\ ; \\langle \\nu_\\beta^{n_j } | \\nu_\\delta^{n_j+1}\\rangle   \\ ;    that is the hopping integral between the molecular vibronic ground states is rescaled by the product of the franck - condom factors on the two sites @xmath15 and @xmath65 , @xmath67 .",
    "the relaxation energy or self - trapping energy ( due to the vibrations ) of the electron pair on a site can be evaluated as the difference between the vertical ionization potential ( or electron affinity ) and the adiabatic one , @xmath68 for @xmath60 and @xmath61 this relaxation energy is as large as @xmath69 .",
    "figure  [ fig : fc ] shows the overlap between the vibrational ground state corresponding to @xmath22 electrons on site @xmath15 ( @xmath70 ) and the different vibrational states corresponding to @xmath71 electrons ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "one sees immediately that for large or even intermediate values of @xmath55 the overlap between the low energy vibrational states is very small .",
    "the consequence is that the electron hopping between two neighboring sites is strongly hindered  ; either the transfer takes place towards small quantum - number vibrational states and the transfer integral is strongly renormalized by the small franck - condom factors , or the transfer takes place towards large quantum - number vibrational states and it is hindered by the vibrational energetic cost .",
    "it is clear that the same phenomenon hinders even more the pair hopping since the displacement is twice as large and the franck - condon factor is squared ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "if one looks at the energy per site as a function of the system size ( or dmrg iteration number ) , one sees that it is nearly constant .",
    "the amplitude of variation between the @xmath74 sites system and the @xmath39 sites system is smaller than @xmath75 for @xmath60 and @xmath63 , the typical example we have chosen for this phase .",
    "this fact could have been surprising but it is easily understood in the context of a strongly hindered hopping . taking into account the electron pairing and the strong localization one can reasonably approximate the system wave - function by @xmath76 @xmath77 of energy @xmath78 the quality of this approximation can be checked on the energy .",
    "the computed dmrg energy per site differs from @xmath79 by at the most @xmath80 in @xmath7 units .",
    "exact diagonalization on a @xmath74-sites system , where the wave function can be explicitly analyzed , confirms this result .",
    "the projection of the exact ground state on @xmath76 being larger than @xmath81 .",
    "in fact the ground state of the @xmath74-sites system is @xmath74 times quasi - degenerated and the infinite system ground state infinitely degenerated .",
    "indeed , in the absence of inter - site coulomb repulsion , any choice for the localization of the electron pairs is equivalent .",
    "even with a @xmath82 coulomb repulsion one sees that the infinite system should remain @xmath74 times quasi - degenerated , the degeneracy lifting being of the order of magnitude of the rescaled hopping integral between the low energy vibrational states , that is of the order of @xmath83 ( @xmath84 for @xmath60 and @xmath63 ) .",
    "the charge gap is therefore exponentially small , the exact diagonalization of the 4-sites system shows that the first exited state with a ",
    "gap is a one - boson vibrational excited state at @xmath85 .",
    "the spin gap is of the order of magnitude of @xmath59 ( @xmath86 in our example ) since it necessitates the breaking of an electron pair .      in the weak coupling regime",
    "  for small values of @xmath55   up to the intermediate coupling regime for intermediate values of the correlation strength , one finds a phase which is essentially a tomanaga - lttinger liquid  @xcite , with parameters slightly rescaled by the presence of the vibrations compare to the purely electronic system .",
    "this result was expected , from continuity from the pure hubbard model , and from previous works from voit and schulz  @xcite ( within a renormalization group ( rg ) scheme in an incommensurate system ) .",
    "we will further refer to this phase as the tomanaga - lttinger ( tl ) phase . while restricted to a very small range of @xmath55 , for large values of the correlation strength , it is worth to notice that this phase extends up to values of @xmath55 larger than @xmath87 for intermediate values of @xmath88 ( see figure  [ fig : diagph02 ] ) .",
    "for very small values of @xmath88 , the competition between the tl phase and a bi - polaronic phase limits the extension of the former to a parameter range for which the effective repulsion remains positive , that is @xmath89 .",
    "the study of the charge - charge and spin - spin correlation functions yield that the main effect of the vibrational degrees of freedom is to rescale the tl liquid parameters   in particular the value of @xmath1   compared to the purely electronic system .",
    "this result is in total agreement with the conclusions derived by voit _",
    "et al . _",
    ".    a simple approach would bring us to think that the value of @xmath1 is increased by the vibrational degrees of freedom since the effective electron - electron repulsion is strongly reduced by the electron - phonons interactions .",
    "let us see what really comes out of the calculations .",
    "the correlation functions have been computed on a @xmath39 sites system with @xmath38 states kept in the dmrg procedure .",
    "they exhibit the expected behavior as a function of the inter - site distance with a power law decay , in agreement with the ungaped nature of both the spin and charge channel .",
    "figure  [ fig : tlcorr ] shows the charge structure factor for the pure hubbard model as well as the hubbard - holstein one for the @xmath90 and @xmath91 set of parameters .",
    "we can see on figure  [ fig : tlcorr ] that the numerical calculations contradict the simple prediction .",
    "the structure factor derivative at @xmath92 is directly proportional to @xmath1  @xcite @xmath93 and is clearly smaller for the @xmath90 and @xmath91 set of parameters than for the @xmath90 hubbard model .",
    "the @xmath1 values computed from the structure factors are @xmath94 for @xmath91 and @xmath95 for the hubbard hamiltonian   in total agreement with the values found in the literature from numerical resolution of the bethe ansatz solution  @xcite .",
    "this unexpected reduction of @xmath1 was already noticed by voit _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite from rg considerations .",
    "one should notice that it can not be attributed to the rescaling of the hopping integral since @xmath96 and the corresponding value of @xmath1 is much larger than @xmath97  @xcite .      in a regime of intermediate coupling and intermediate to large correlation strength , we found a phase for which the charge correlation functions are dominated by @xmath0 charge density wave ( cdw ) fluctuations .",
    "the multiplication of the correlation functions by @xmath98 ( @xmath99 being the inter - sites distance ) allows the elimination , when the fourier transform is performed , of the @xmath100 term that contribute at all frequencies .",
    "the frequency analysis of @xmath101the correlation function is therefore much clearer , and the relative importance of the @xmath102 and @xmath0 terms enhanced .",
    "figure  [ fig : cdwcorr1 ] reports this fourier analysis for @xmath60 and @xmath91 .",
    "one can see that while the spin - spin correlation function is change very little compared to the hubbard model , the @xmath102 contribution to the charge - charge correlation function has disappeared and a strong @xmath0 contribution has set place .",
    "figure  [ fig : cdwcorr2 ] reports the same correlation functions as a function of the inter - sites distance .",
    "both charge and spin correlation functions decrease as a power law as a function of the inter - sites distance speaking in favor of a gap - less system in both the spin and charge channels . the charge and spin gaps",
    "have been computed independently from double extrapolations ( i ) on the chain length and on the number of states kept in the dmrg calculations , i.e. @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 . while the charge channel clearly extrapolates toward a null gap , in the spin channel the question is not as clear . indeed , the gap is found to be @xmath103 for a dmrg calculation where @xmath36 states are kept , @xmath104 for @xmath37 states kept and @xmath105 for @xmath38 .",
    "these gap values are very small however they do not extrapolate toward a null value when the quality of the calculation increases .",
    "this behavior pleads for a non null but very small gap in the spin channel .",
    "one should note that this result is not incoherent with the spin - spin correlation function behavior since such a small gap means a very large coherence length , of the order of magnitude of @xmath106 , i.e. the exponential behavior of the correlation function should take place at inter - sites distances larger than the chain length .    in the lttinger liquid theory",
    "the @xmath0 phase is supposed to occur for values of the @xmath1 parameter smaller than @xmath107 , that is ( i ) in very strongly correlated systems and ( ii ) for values of @xmath1 unreachable in the hubbard model   for which @xmath108 . the presence of intra - molecular vibrations not only allows the existence of a @xmath0 cdw phase , but this phase can be reached for values of the bi - electronic repulsion as small as @xmath109 ( and most probably even lower ) .",
    "we computed the @xmath1 values from the structure factors and found that similarly to what happened in the tl phase , the @xmath1 value is strongly diminished in comparison to the purely electronic case . for @xmath60 and @xmath110",
    "the value of @xmath1 is @xmath111 while it is @xmath112 for the @xmath60 hubbard model .",
    "one should however note that the @xmath111 value is in good agreement with the @xmath1 expected for the effective parameters , @xmath113 .      for positive @xmath59 but relatively large values of @xmath55 ,",
    "the system is in a small polarons phase ( diamonds on fig .",
    "[ fig : diagph02 ] ) . indeed the electrons are no longer paired but are still strongly localized .",
    "the probability of having two electrons on the central site is smaller than @xmath114 for @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 sites ( @xmath118 and @xmath119 ) . these lonely electrons remain strongly coupled to the intra - molecular vibrations .",
    "the on - site vibrational relaxation energy is as large as @xmath120 and the rescaled hopping integral between the ground vibrational states as low as @xmath121 .",
    "the ground - state wave - function can be approximated by the totally localized wave - function @xmath122 @xmath123 and the residual hopping term treated perturbatively .",
    "the overlap of the exact ground - state wave - function of an @xmath74-sites system with @xmath122 is as large as @xmath124 for @xmath125 and @xmath116 and even as large as @xmath126 for @xmath127 and @xmath128 which is very closed to the phase transition .",
    "coherently , the dmrg energies per site remains nearly constant as the system size increases , with a maximal variation of @xmath129 from @xmath130 , for @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "as for the bi - polaronic phase the absence of coulombic inter - site repulsion in our model induces a strong quasi - degeneracy of the ground - state : @xmath131 times for the @xmath74-sites system but infinitely for the infinite system . even in the presence of a @xmath82 repulsion ,",
    "the system would remain at least twice quasi - degenerated due to the even sites versus odd sites equivalence with an additional factor of 4 due to the spin quasi - degeneracy .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have studied the conditions of existence of this phase by exact diagonalization on small clusters ( 4 and 6 sites ) .",
    "they found that the localized polarons phase is stable as long as the polarization energy defined as @xmath132 is larger than the electronic energy @xmath133 .",
    "@xmath134 is the filling of the system .",

    "have been plotted .",
    "this small polarons phase corresponds to very large values of the @xmath136 ratio .      finally for negative values of @xmath59 , but large values of @xmath137 a delocalized phase takes place for which all spin , charge and on - site",
    "singlet correlation functions seem to decrease with the inter - site distance as a power law .",

    "the hh model is in this case indistinguishable from the pure hubbard model and , as a consequence , the @xmath1 values as not sensitive ( to numerical accuracy ) to the electron - phonons coupling .",

    ".    for @xmath153 one has a luther - emery phase for small values of @xmath55 .",
    "this phase is very similar to the one found for @xmath155 , with an effective attractive on - site interaction and large effective hopping integrals .",
    "the cdw and the on - site singlet fluctuations dominate , and become of the same order of magnitude for @xmath140 and @xmath143 . for larger values of the electron - phonons coupling , the cdw are larger than the singlet fluctuations ( @xmath144 and @xmath90 ) . as for the @xmath156 case , all three correlation functions   spin - spin , charge - charge and singlet - singlet   present a power law behavior as a function of the inter - sites distance for the @xmath39 sites system .",
    "the direct calculation of the charge and spin gaps yield and ungaped charge channel and a slightly gaped spin channel with @xmath157 for @xmath90 and @xmath61 , as well as for @xmath143 and @xmath140 .",

    "indeed , for @xmath90 and @xmath159 the system is clearly localized in a bi - polaronic phase with the usual characteristics  : nearly constant energy per site , large projection of the wave function on @xmath76 ( @xmath160 for the 4 sites system ) , etc ... for @xmath90 and @xmath91 however , the system is in an intermediate regime .",
    "the delocalization is still reasonably large with an effective hopping of @xmath161 and a projection of the 4 sites system wave function on @xmath76 of only @xmath162 . in this cross over regime ,",

    "when the electron - phonons coupling increases , the system goes toward a localized bi - polaronic phase through a soft cross - over .    at low frequency ( @xmath54 )",
    "however , a rich phase diagram have been found with 5 different phases , some delocalized and some strongly localized . for positive effective interactions one has three different phases . for small electron - phonons coupling and intermediate coupling for small correlation strength ,",
    "the system is in a lttinger liquid phase . for intermediate electron - phonons coupling ,",
    "the system is in a phase for which the @xmath102 charge fluctuations disappear and the charge correlation functions have only @xmath0 cdw fluctuations . for large electron - phonons coupling",
    ", the system is strongly localized in a polaronic phase .",
    "when the effective interaction become negative , one finds a luther - emery phase for small electron - phonons coupling , and a strongly localized bi - polaronic phase for intermediate to large couplings .",
    "the luther - emery phase has a very small spin gap ( of the order of @xmath171 and the spin - spin correlation functions exhibit a power law decrease up to at least 60 to 80 sites ) . unlike for @xmath154 , for @xmath155 the delocalized phases do not behave as would the @xmath170 , @xmath168 effective hubbard model . indeed",
    "the @xmath1 parameter is strongly decreased due to the electron - phonons interactions while the decrease of the effective repulsion ( compared to the pure hubbard model ) would have led us to expect an opposite behavior .",
    "this surprising decrease of the @xmath1 parameters should be put in context with values of the @xmath1 parameters found in photo - emission experiments on @xmath47 and @xmath172 quasi - one - dimensional organic compounds  @xcite .",
    "indeed zwick _ et al . _",
    "@xcite found a density of states exponent @xmath173 slightly larger than 1 ( @xmath174 in the metallic phase . according to the lttinger liquid theory the system should be insulating for such large values of @xmath175 .",
    "tentative explanations have been made by schwartz _",
    "@xcite , involving an effective doping of a mott insulator due to the inter - chain hopping . on another hand ,",
    "the electron intra - molecular vibrations interactions are never considered in these systems .",
    "for the low frequency modes of these systems , the typical energy scale of the electron - phonons interaction  : @xmath176 is of the order of magnitude of one - half to one - fourth the intra - chain hopping amplitude  @xcite , that is in the intermediate regime of our phase diagram .",
    "for such values of the electron - phonons coupling constants and values of the electronic repulsion between one to four @xmath7 , the system is in a lttinger liquid phase for which the intra - molecular vibrations strongly decrease the @xmath1 parameter compared to its electronic value .",
    "it is clear that the hubbard model lacks at least nearest - neighbor bi - electronic repulsion in order to well represent these systems .",
    "it can however be expected that the trend toward a strong reduction of the @xmath1 parameters , observed in the hubbard - holstein model , would be similar with longer range interactions , and that the coupling of the electronic degrees of freedom with the intra - molecular vibrations would lead to values of the @xmath175 parameter unreachable in a purely electronic model .",
    "considering these trends , it is reasonable to think the the electron intra - molecular vibrations coupling will have to be considered in order to obtain a realistic description of the observed photo - emission experimental data ."
