    "as we move to the era of exascale computing systems , the power requirements and performance limitations of electrical interconnects based on metal wires will limit the continued improvement of computing systems as expected by the marketplace and delivered by moore s law @xcite .",
    "silicon photonics is poised to offer the low power consumption , tight integration with cmos electronics , and low cost needed to alleviate the strain that interconnection networks are putting on computing systems .",
    "in addition to linear optical components ( waveguides , resonators , grating couplers ) , the optical nonlinearity of silicon provides a means by which some simple logic and switching operations may be carried out in the optical domain without the additional latency and power consumption of optical - electrical - optical conversions @xcite .",
    "recently , hydrogenated amorphous silicon ( a - si : h ) has emerged as a candidate for nonlinear optical devices compatible with back - end - of - line ( beol ) cmos fabrication .",
    "the use of low - temperature deposition processes allows for the possibility of multiple photonic layers integrated with cmos transistors .",
    "a - si : h has become more widely used as a photonic material in the past several years as investigators have found that its nonlinear optical properties in the telecom band are superior to those of c - si .",
    "a - si : h single- and multimode waveguides were fabricated in 2005 @xcite , and reports of resonators with @xmath1 s exceeding @xmath2 date from 2009 , fabricated using both traditional and damascene processes @xcite .",
    "investigations of nonlinear properties have focused either on characterization of material nonlinearity through self - phase modulation experiments @xcite , pump - probe experiments to characterize waveguides@xcite , or four - wave mixing for wavelength conversion@xcite .",
    "there have also been recent demonstrations of parametric amplification @xcite and low - power optical frequency conversion of optical data signals @xcite .",
    "a central issue inhibiting more widespread use of a - si : h is the strong dependence of material properties on details of the growth techniques .",
    "modern a - si : h growth is done using plasma - enhanced chemical vapor deposition ( pecvd ) .",
    "it has been generally found that material quality improves and defect density decreases with slower growth rates @xcite . as a - si",
    ": h has been studied for many years for its potential in photovoltaic solar cells , a detailed understanding of the role of dangling bond defects has emerged @xcite .",
    "dangling bonds result in defect states in the bandgap and could therefore contribute to two - state absorption . in some nonlinear optics investigations of a - si : h devices , it has been found that the waveguide properties and nonlinearity degrade over a period of minutes at high optical intensities due to effects that are presumed to be associated with dangling bond defects @xcite . similarly to several recent reports @xcite , no optical degradation has been observed in our waveguides over a period of months of investigation , with similar peak pump powers ; the a - si : h growth recipe described in produces a film which results in stable waveguides .      in an optical resonator ,",
    "if a change @xmath3 in the refractive index @xmath4 can be introduced by optical means , then a frequency shift @xmath5 in the resonant frequency @xmath6 obeys the the relation @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the group index .",
    "the imparted resonance shift can bring a probe signal at @xmath9 into or out of resonance with the cavity , switching its transmission on or off . in a microring resonator with a single access waveguide ( the all - pass configuration ) , when a probe signal is on resonance such that @xmath10 the probe transmission is low .",
    "when the index change occurs , the probe is then brought out of resonance such that its transmission increases until the index perturbation drops back to zero .",
    "there are several mechanisms by which an optical switch can be driven . in a material lacking inversion symmetry ,",
    "the lowest - order bound - electronic optical nonlinearity is due to the @xmath11 tensor . a common technique , and",
    "the one exploited in this paper , is to use cross - phase modulation ( xpm ) , where the index change is proportional to the optical intensity as @xmath12 . for si at 1550 nm , the nonlinear index @xmath13  m@xmath14/w @xcite .",
    "however , due to the kramers - kronig relationship arising from very general arguments of causality , nonlinear refraction is always accompanied by nonlinear ( two - photon ) absorption , which can also give rise to cross - amplitude modulation ( xam ) @xcite .",
    "xam acts to increase the loss @xmath15 of the optical resonator such that its resonance shift @xmath5 is also accompanied by an increase in the linewidth @xmath16 , effectively `` blurring out '' the optical switching effect . the figure - of - merit for xpm optical switching @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the two - photon absorption coefficient and @xmath19 is the wavelength of light , quantifies the quality of an xpm - based optical switch .",
    "the nonlinear fom has been measured to be between 2 and 5 for a - si : h @xcite , and approximately 0.3 for c - si @xcite .",
    "in addition to bound - electronic nonlinear effects due to @xmath11 , other physical processes based on real ( rather than virtual ) excitations can impart an index change @xmath3 .",
    "optical switching experiments in c - si are dominated by effects due to free carriers @xcite . at a wavelength of 1.5  @xmath0 m ,",
    "two - photon absorption in c - si or a - si : h can generate free carriers , which can also cause index changes or absorption changes through the free - carrier dispersion and absorption processes ( fcd / fca ) , respectively . as the effects are due to real carriers , the switching speed will be limited by the rate at which carriers recombine or diffuse out of the structure : this speed can be increased by embedding the resonator in a @xmath20 diode @xcite , or ion implantation to create more recombination sites ( at the expense of increased losses ) @xcite .",
    "additionally , the absorption of light creates a local temperature shift @xmath21 , which can act via the thermo - optic effect to create a resonance shift as well .",
    "an important aspect of these two processes is that their speed is determined by the rate at which the physical excitations relax back to their equilibrium values , which can be tens of ns in the case of thermal shifts and between tens of ps to a few ns for carrier effects .",
    "a coupled - mode theory ( cmt ) model of optical switching in a pump - probe configuration is presented in the appendix .",
    "a central point is that the combination of the three nonlinear effects described here can be encapsulated in a single nonlinear frequency shift term @xmath22 included in the cmt equations .",
    "when dynamical equations for the carrier density @xmath23 and @xmath21 are included , a complete picture of the pump  probe interactions is obtained , which we show to agree very well with our observed experimental results .    in",
    "we discuss the techniques for growth of hydrogenated amorphous silicon films and fabrication of optical devices . in we present results on optical switching experiments performed on microring resonators fabricated out of both a - si : h and c - si .",
    "we use a pump  probe technique with pump pulses of duration 2.7  ps , close to the photon lifetime of microring resonators with @xmath1 s near @xmath2 at 1.55  @xmath0 m of about 8  ps .",
    "we observe switching of the transmission of a probe over a timescale of 14.8  ps , using approximately 720  fj of deposited energy in a 10-@xmath0m - diameter a - si : h microring .",
    "the initial experiments on pump  probe switching in undoped c - si microrings reported switching times of approximately 500  ps @xcite . switching times in cmos - compatible optical switches of 25 ps",
    "have been reported in an oxygen - implanted microring @xcite , and 135  ps in a polycrystalline si microring @xcite , which were both due to free - carrier effects .     scanning electron micrographs of a - si : h devices after etching : ( a ) layout of microring device with bus waveguide and grating couplers ; ( b ) close - up of grating coupler for tm - polarized light ; ( c ) a 5-@xmath0m - diameter a - si : h microring and bus waveguide . ]",
    "in this section we give an overview of the a - si : h growth and device fabrication procedures .",
    "our fabrication process begins with si @xmath24 wafers upon which 2  @xmath0 m of sio@xmath25 has been grown by thermal oxidation .",
    "we then grow an a - si : h film by plasma - enhanced chemical vapor deposition ( pecvd ) to the desired thickness .",
    "for the devices described in this paper , the a - si : h film thickness was 250  nm . our pecvd growth process uses sih@xmath26 and ar gases , flowed at rates of 25 and 50 sccm , respectively , with the chamber maintained at a pressure of 900 mtorr .",
    "the substrate is heated to a temperature of 300@xmath27  c and two rf tones are used in alternation at a power of 20  w , which we have found improves film quality .",
    "this recipe results in an a - si : h growth rate of 43 nm / min , and we have been able to grow films of up to 2.5-@xmath0 m thickness without delamination .",
    "the refractive index of the film was characterized with ellipsometry to give a result of @xmath28 at 1550  nm , differing from the c - si value of 3.48 by about 2% .",
    "we have found that photonic component designs intended for crystalline soi devices work reasonably well for a - si : h without any modifications .    following a - si : h growth ,",
    "waveguides are patterned using electron beam lithography using hydrogen silesquioxane ( hsq ) resist , followed by reactive ion etching using hbr chemistry .",
    "the a - si : h film is etched all the way down to the oxide to form wire waveguides with no pedestal layer .",
    "shows as - fabricated a - si : h devices following etching . after etching ,",
    "an 800-nm - thick sio@xmath25 cladding layer is grown by pecvd , which provides symmetric optical confinement and passivates the etched surfaces . in ( a )",
    ", we see a bent waveguide with a ring in the center of the optical path between two grating couplers . in ( c )",
    ", we see a closeup sem of a 5-@xmath0m - diameter microring and bus waveguide .",
    "the grating couplers use a non - periodic design to minimize fabry - perot reflections , and are designed to couple light from a cleaved optical fiber to the tm mode of the a - si : h wire waveguide .",
    "the grating design is adapted from the design for te - mode grating couplers presented in @xcite ; an sem of a fabricated grating is shown in ( b ) .",
    "tm polarization was chosen because the modes see less sidewall roughness in the tightly bent ring waveguide , which reduces coupling to counter - propagating modes @xcite .",
    "a difficulty with designing grating couplers for tm polarization is that the scattered polarization ( in the waveguide ) is nearly orthogonal to the input polarization , which reduces the scattering strength of the grating .",
    "therefore , larger grooves are needed than for te polarization .",
    "one benefit of the tm grating design is that an additional shallow etch to define the grating grooves is not required ; the entire structure including the gratings is fabricated using the same deep etch .",
    "the calculated maximum scattering efficiency for this grating design is approximately -4  db .",
    "we also fabricated microring resonators and waveguides using a standard undoped crystalline silicon - on - insulator wafer .",

    "we fabricated all - pass ( with the geometry shown in ( a ) ) microring resonators with a range of coupling waveguide widths and coupling gaps and performed laser transmission measurements .",
    "as in c - si devices , it is found that optimum resonator @xmath1 and extinction ratio are observed when the coupling waveguide width is somewhat narrower than the ring waveguide @xcite . when measuring the linear optical properties of the microring devices , we use a photonically enabled semiconductor probe station in which we couple light into the devices using a cleaved single - mode fiber , and couple out light using a multimode fiber .",
    "( a ) shows a measured transmission scan for the 10-@xmath0 m a - si : h microring used in the switching experiments described below .",
    "we have zoomed in on a single resonance at @xmath32  nm , where we observe @xmath29 and an extinction ratio of @xmath33  db , showing operation very near critical coupling .",
    "the total throughput of the device was approximately -12  db , and is attributed mainly to inefficiency of the grating coupler .",
    "when single - mode fibers are used for both excitation and collection from the device , throughput drops to approximately -14.5  db . at wavelengths near 1550  nm , the free - spectral range for 10-@xmath0m - diameter ( 5-@xmath0m - diameter ) microrings is found to be approximately 17.1 nm ( 33.2 nm ) . with proper designs ( coupling waveguide width between 300 and 400 nm , ring waveguide width 450 nm , and edge - to - edge coupling gap between the ring and bus waveguide between 200 and 350 nm ) and using the fabrication process described in , we obtained @xmath1 s of approximately @xmath2 and extinction ratios better than 10  db , with the best devices having @xmath1 s near @xmath34 .",

    ", we can also find the propagation loss of the microring , which we determined to be @xmath38  db / cm @xcite .",
    "this loss value is an upper bound for the bus waveguide as we suspect losses in the ring are primarily due to scattering and radiation losses due to the sidewall roughness and the tight bend radius , respectively",
    ". the propagation loss of the bus waveguide does not play a major role in determining the device throughput .",

    "the pump source is a mode - locked erbium - doped fiber laser which produces pulses of approximately 150 fs duration at a repetition rate of 100 mhz .",
    "we use a tunable band - pass filter to narrow the pulse spectrum to approximately 2 nm and center it on a ring resonance of interest , and then amplify the narrowed pulses with an edfa , and use a second band - pass filter to clean up the spontaneous emission noise from the edfa .",
    "cleaved single - mode fibers are used for both in- and out - coupling from the device for the pump  probe measurements .",
    "the filtered pump source produces pulses of duration @xmath31  ps ( @xmath39 intensity radius ) with peak powers up to about 50 w in fiber .",

    "the probe source is a cw external - cavity diode laser ( ecdl ) ; probe radiation is combined with the pump pulses in a fiber - optic wdm , and is coupled to the devices through the grating coupler .",
    "we position the pump and probe wavelengths on adjacent ring resonances separated by one free - spectral range ; this frequency separation allows straightforward combining and separating of the pump and probe signals .",
    "light transmitted through the device is collected into another single - mode fiber , and sent through a second wdm to separate the pump and probe .",
    "the transmitted pump is sent to an optical spectrum analyzer where we can monitor its spectrum in real time .",
    "the transmitted probe light is amplified with a second edfa , filtered to remove spontaneous emission noise , and sent to a 55-ghz sampling oscilloscope which is triggered by the pump laser . in the oscilloscope measurements of probe power versus time , we average 16 traces to reduce noise . in all experiments ,",

    "the pump pulse arrives , and induces a kerr - effect ( xpm ) redshift of the cavity , resulting in a spike in transmission as @xmath45 moves further away from @xmath44 .",
    "since the cavity photon lifetime @xmath48  ps is longer than the pulsewidth @xmath42 , it plays the main role in determining the xpm switching timescale by governing the rate at which the pump light exits the resonator .",
    "after the xpm response has died off , the steep drop in transmission is due to fcd caused by carriers created by tpa of the strong pump .",
    "we have measured the free - carrier lifetime in a - si : h to be approximately 160 ps using these pump  probe experiments ( fitting procedures are described in ) .",
    "following the diffusion and/or recombination of the carriers , the temperature change due to the heat deposited by pump absorption slowly relaxes until the next pump pulse arrives , 10 ns after the first .",

    "the peak pump power was set to 1.1  w in the bus waveguide , and the probe power was set to -12.5  dbm ( 56  @xmath0w ) . because the tpa / fcd effect scales quadratically with the pump power while xpm scales linearly with pump power , in this experiment with approximately @xmath50 less pump power than that for , the carrier effects are reduced by nearly an order of magnitude . to estimate the energy used in the switching measurement shown in ( a )",
    ", we note that the peak power of 1.1  w for our fit pulsewidth of 2.7 ps corresponds to a pulse energy of 3.0 pj .",
    "the spectrum in ( b ) shows that the bandwidth mismatch between the pump and the microring results in incomplete loading of the cavity by the pump pulse .",
    "we define the cavity loading efficiency as the fraction of the incident pump pulse that is dissipated in the cavity .",
    "a cavity loading efficiency of 24% was observed for the 2.7-ps - pulses by comparing the throughput of the pump pulses whether tuned on or off the cavity resonance , and was confirmed through numerical simulations .",
    "we can use the cavity loading efficiency to determine the energy dissipated in the switching operation , which is found to be 720  fj .",
    "we used the experimental results of ( a ) to help fit the material parameters by comparing with numerical integration of the cmt equations as described in the appendix .",
    "we assume the grating couplers perform symmetrically and the throughput of the device is dominated by the grating couplers ( i.e. propagation loss is zero ) to determine @xmath51 in the bus waveguides . for properties of the microring resonator",

    "two probe transmission traces are shown in ( c ) for probe wavelengths either very near ( 1537.48 nm ) or slightly red - detuned ( 1537.66 nm ) from the cavity resonance . when the probe is initially on resonance , its transmission is low until the pump pulse arrives and redshifts the cavity resonance .",
    "once the pump leaves the cavity , the cavity recovers nearly to its original position , with a slight redshift remaining due to heat deposited in the cavity by absorption of the pump . in the red - detuned case ,",
    "the initially non - resonant probe has high transmission until the pump xpm - induced redshift brings the cavity into resonance , causing a probe transmission drop . the shortest fwhm switching time we observed in the set of traces in ( a ) is 14.8 ps . in both experiments and simulations the switching time",

    "a similar procedure was used for measurement of @xmath56 .",
    "one difference we observe between the experiment and simulation is that for probe wavelengths initially on the cavity resonance , the switching pulse is higher than the quiescent non - resonant probe power ( red area of ( a ) ) .",
