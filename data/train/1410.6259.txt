    "a collection of heavy quarkonium - like xyz states have been observed by a number of experiments ( for recent reviews , see refs .",
    "it is difficult to understand these states within the quark model  @xcite , wherein hadrons are either baryons @xmath4 or mesons @xmath5 .",
    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) suggests that a far richer spectrum of hadrons is possible , including so - called exotic hadrons such as hybrid mesons @xmath6 .",
    "these are composed of a color - octet quark - antiquark pair and an excited gluon .",
    "hybrids and mesons can have common @xmath0 quantum numbers , and , because of their additional gluonic degrees of freedom , hybrids can also have exotic quantum numbers @xmath7 which are inaccessible to mesons .",
    "heavy quarkonium hybrids , which we shall refer to as heavy hybrids , have been studied using the constituent gluon model  @xcite , the flux tube model  @xcite , the quasi - gluon model  @xcite and lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "these studies broadly agree that heavy hybrids should exist in the same mass range as heavy quarkonia , suggesting that some of the xyz states could be heavy hybrids .",
    "qcd sum rules ( qsr ) is a non - perturbative method that can be used to predict hadron parameters , including masses ( see ref .",

    "the qsr analyses therein included leading - order perturbative and dimension - four gluon condensate contributions for several distinct @xmath0 channels .",
    "however , some of the sum rules exhibited instabilities , leading to unreliable mass predictions .",
    "recently , the sum rules for the @xmath8  @xcite and @xmath9  @xcite channels have been updated to include the effect of dimension - six condensates .",
    "these contributions stabilize the sum rules , permitting reliable heavy hybrid mass predictions to be made . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath10 channel was also updated , confirming previous results @xcite for this channel .",

    "no such states have been observed to date .",
