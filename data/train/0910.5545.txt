    "my presentation in ustron09 was done under the title `` long - baseline ( lbl ) neutrinos ; looking forward to the future '' .",
    "it included a review of the ideas for exploration of the unknowns in the 1 - 3 sector of the mns matrix @xcite , cp violation due to the lepton analogue of the kobayashi - maskawa phase @xcite @xmath4 and the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "if i restrict myself into perspective in north - east asia , they include an upgrade of j - parc beam with megaton - scale hyper - kamiokande ( t2k ii ) as described in @xcite , a 100 kt scale liquid ar detector in okinoshima @xcite , and the tokai - to - kamioka - korea ( for short t2kk ) setting @xcite .",
    "the overview of the latter is given in @xcite .",
    "in particular , i emphasized the kamioka - korea identical two - detector setting as a robust way of measuring the cp violating phase and determining the mass hierarchy .",
    "it combines the idea of low energy superbeam as the cleanest way for detecting lepton cp violation @xcite and the powerfulness of the two - detector method @xcite .",
    "but , since the contents of this part are described in the previous reports @xcite i confine myself into the last part of my presentation in ustron09 , the large-@xmath0 perturbation theory in this written version .",
    "the motivation for formulating the large-@xmath0 perturbation theory is very simple ; @xmath0 can be as large as the chooz limit @xcite . if it is the case @xmath5 .",
    "i emphasize that this possibility is to be tested very soon by the accelerator @xcite and the reactor @xmath0 experiments @xcite some of which will start in 2009 . then , the @xmath6 perturbation theory ( in a terminology defined in @xcite ) formulated under the ansatz @xmath7 , which provides the simplest way of deriving the widely used cervera _ et al .",
    "_ formula @xcite of the oscillation probability , would not serve as the best approximation .    then , what is the use of the large-@xmath0 perturbation theory ?",
    "i confine in this paper the robustness issue in uncovering lepton cp violation .",
    "as is well recognized the matter effect produces a fake cp violation .",
    "the presence of the matter effect is inevitable for settings which also have sensitivity to the mass hierarchy .",
    "early references of this topics include @xcite .",
    "the problem has been discussed in a number of authors which produced too many references to quote here .",
    "however , there exists a point which does not appear to be given full attention in the literature , the problem of possible asymmetry in matter density profile in the earth .",
    "see , however , @xcite for discussion of this problem .",
    "it is known that asymmetric baseline produces cp violating @xmath8 terms in @xmath9 @xcite , and @xmath10 terms in t violating observable @xmath11 @xcite which invalidates the neat property of t violation , @xmath12 for vanishing @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "apparently , the effects of asymmetric matter density profile is most prominent for large @xmath0",
    ".    a crucial question would be : are there any situation in which sizable asymmetry in matter density profile shows up ?",
    "the answer is indeed _",
    "yes_. suppose a baseline of order @xmath13 km and a neutrino beam launched at a place on a continent is received by a detector which is placed in an island .",
    "if the travel distances of the beam in the continent and in the sea are comparable , one can expect asymmetry in the density profile because the matter density in the earth crust is believed to be smaller under the sea .",
    "contrary to the mantle density , the crust density is not severely restricted by the earth mass , and it would not be easy to measure it directly either .",
    "therefore , it is important to investigate to what extent cp violation discovery might be obscured by asymmetry in matter density profile .",
    "the neutrino evolution equation can be written in flavor basis as @xmath14 . in the standard three - flavor neutrino scheme ,",
    "hamiltonian is given by @xmath15 u^{\\dagger } +   a(x ) \\left [ \\begin{array}{ccc } 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{array } \\right ]   % \\right\\ }   % \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{hamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the coefficient which is related to the index of refraction of neutrinos in medium of electron number density @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the fermi constant and @xmath20 is the neutrino energy .",
    "@xmath21 is the mns matrix @xcite in the lepton sector .",
    "it is straightforward to formulate the perturbative framework of neutrino oscillations .",
    "we refer @xcite for notations .",
    "we use the tilde - basis @xmath22 with the tilde - hamiltonian @xmath23 , which is decomposed as @xmath24 .",
    "then , the @xmath25 matrix can be written as @xmath26 @xmath27 can be expanded with use of @xmath28 as @xmath29 where the `` space - ordered '' form in ( [ omega - exp ] ) is essential because of the highly nontrivial spatial dependence in @xmath30 .",
    "we use the method of fourier decomposition to incorporate the effect of matter density variation in the earth @xcite with the dimensionless variable @xmath31 .",
    "it can be expanded into a fourier series as @xmath32 \\label{ra - fourier}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 .",
    "it should be noticed that if @xmath34 , namely if the baseline is symmetric , @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , the imaginary part of @xmath36 represents the effect of asymmetric matter density profile .",
    "we assume large @xmath0 comparable to the chooz limit , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 .",
    "other small parameters are present depending upon experimental setting , in combination with matter density , neutrino energy , and baseline . as a model superbeam experiment we consider a baseline with distance @xmath39 km and neutrino energy @xmath40 gev . noticing that @xmath41 , the setting leads to @xmath42 .",
    "( for t2k ii setting , @xmath43 may be more appropriate . )",
    "then , we formulate the large-@xmath0 perturbation theory by taking the following expansion parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",

    "it appears that this feature prevails for other choices of cp violating phase @xmath4 .",
    "i have also checked that the effect of the asymmetry becomes even smaller for shorter baseline and/or smaller @xmath0 .",

    "some remarks are in order :    * the size of the matter effect ( difference between blue and green lines ) gives a dominant effect in @xmath74 , overturning the negative sign of the vacuum contribution in this particular case .",

    "cpt - violation observable would be most powerful to resolve the mass hierarchy @xcite because it gives the largest @xmath80 . * in cp ( also t ) violation observable , the energy dependence of the average matter density term ( blue minus ( green + red ) ) are rather similar to the vacuum term",
    ". then , there could be severe confusion between cp violation caused by phase and uncertainty in the average density of matter .",
    "in particular , it gives rise to a serious confusion at @xmath81 because of its @xmath10 dependence .",
    "careful spectrum analysis would be required to resolve the confusion between the matter - cp and phase - cp effects . * for smaller @xmath82 , which may be relevant for neutrino factory setting",
    ", one can show by using the @xmath6 perturbation theory @xcite with small matter density variation of @xmath83 that the terms sensitive to density variation are at most of order @xmath84 .",
