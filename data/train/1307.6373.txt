    "by exploiting the diversity provided by fading channels , multi - antenna receivers can enhance the communication performance . in the absence of multi - user interference or when interference is treated as white noise",
    ", it has been shown that mrc is optimal@xcite . in mrc , the signals received at various branches or antennas are first weighted according to the signal - to - noise ratios experienced on those branches and then coherently combined to maximize the post - combiner signal - to - noise ratio . as with all the diversity - combining techniques , correlation among the signals received on different branches reduces the achievable diversity gains@xcite , typically measured using the outage probability notion .",
    "for mrc in particular , fading correlation and average received - power imbalance across the branches , both of which are often encountered in practice , may reduce the resulting performance significantly when compared to the ideal case@xcite . despite its sensitivity to such non - idealities , mrc is prevalent in most of today s wireless consumer products , such as wireless routers and laptops , that employ antenna - diversity .",
    "in addition to the fading correlation , interference across diversity branches at a multi - antenna receiver is also _ spatially correlated _ due to the common locations of the interferers .",
    "characterizing this type of correlation is challenging as it depends on many factors including the number and geometry of the surrounding interferers as well as their instantaneous channels towards a given receiver .",
    "even worse , the network geometry , and hence the interference often appears random to the user due to mobility or irregular node deployment@xcite , making a precise characterization of the resulting performance under spatial interference correlation cumbersome .    in this context , the authors of@xcite started using tools from stochastic geometry to obtain a more profound understanding of the interference correlation in a wireless network .",
    "these tools were identified as the key enablers for modeling the spatial and temporal interference correlation , and for analyzing their influence on various communications strategies . in principle , the interference is assumed to originate from a stochastic point process that models the interferer locations ; thereby naturally capturing the origins of spatial correlation of interference .",
    "this approach led to an exact performance characterization of the simple retransmission mechanism@xcite and of selection combining@xcite under interference correlation .",
    "an extension was presented in@xcite , where it was shown that neglecting the interference correlation may lead to a delusive performance characterization .",
    "similar tools were used in@xcite to study the benefits of cooperative relaying in a multi - user scenario .",
    "these works clearly demonstrate that diversity exploiting techniques suffer a _",
    "diversity loss _ when interference correlation is properly accounted for .",
    "more sophisticated receive - diversity schemes that do not treat interference as pure noise were analyzed in@xcite for linear minimum mean square error combining , and in@xcite for zero - forcing and optimal combining .",
    "the throughput scaling of decentralized networks with multi - antenna receivers was analyzed in@xcite .    despite this progress",
    ", the performance characterization of mrc in the presence of spatial interference correlation is largely open and is the main focus of this paper .",
    "in@xcite , mrc was studied by assuming the _ same _ interference level at all the receive branches which neglects the diversity in the fading gains of the interfering links .",
    "the effect of unequal interference levels on the outage probability for mrc was analyzed in@xcite for deterministic interference levels and without a specific correlation model . instead of assuming",

    ", we characterize the distribution of @xmath0 for mrc in the presence of spatially - correlated interference under realistic channel assumptions that include both long - term path loss effects and small scale fading effects , modeled as rayleigh .",
    "the main contributions are summarized below .",
    "_ outage probability and the distribution of @xmath0 .",
    "_ as the main result , we derive a closed - form expression for the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of the @xmath0 , equivalently outage probability , for the dual - antenna mrc case in section  [ sec : main_result ] . the result accounts for all relevant system parameters including transmitter density , path loss exponent and communication distance . for the important case of a path loss exponent of @xmath2",
    ", we obtain a simplified expression that requires only a single numerical integration .",
    "we stress that the dual - antenna case is of significant importance in current wireless systems , where most of the wireless devices , such as handhelds , laptops or wireless routers , are often equipped with at most two antennas due to complexity constraints and space limitations . in section  [ sec : bounds ] , we generalize our analysis to an arbitrary number of receive antennas by deriving lower and upper bounds on the @xmath0 distribution .",
    "although the construction of these bounds is rather simple , they allow a performance characterization of mrc . the usefulness of these bounds , quantified by the gap between the upper and lower bounds , decreases for very large number of antennas and small path loss exponents .",
    "_ comparison with simpler correlation models .",
    "_ the exact @xmath0 distribution under spatial correlation can also be used to benchmark the performance of simpler correlation models used in the literature .",
    "we demonstrate that the full - correlation assumption for interference across receive branches yields a considerably pessimistic ( up to roughly @xmath1 for typical values ) estimate of the cdf of @xmath0 .",
    "this is because with the full - correlation assumption , the diversity among the fading gains on the different interfering links is effectively removed which , consequently , lowers the overall achievable diversity .",
    "in contrast , the no - correlation assumption overestimates the overall achievable diversity by neglecting the fact that the interference impinging at the different antennas originate from the same set of transmitters . as a result , the no - correlation assumption leads to a significantly optimistic characterization of the true performance .",
    "_ applications of the developed theory . _ in section  [ sec : outage_scaling ] , we characterize the diversity behavior of mrc using the notion of spatial - contention diversity order , which was introduced in@xcite .",
    "while for a single isolated link , the diversity order gain ( measured by the outage probability slope ) of mrc theoretically scales with the number of antennas , this is not true for the multi - user case .",
    "this pitfall is due to the spatial interference correlation , which virtually disperses possible diversity order gains in the asymptotic regime .",
    "we then determine the network - wide critical density of simultaneous transmissions given a target outage probability in section  [ sec : critical_density ] .",
    "the exact critical density is obtained for the dual - antenna case using the main result , while the developed bounds are used to characterize the critical density for larger number of antennas . in order to complement the insights obtained using these bounds",

    "<S> while the performance of maximum ratio combining ( mrc ) is well understood for a single isolated link , the same is not true in the presence of interference , which is typically correlated across antennas due to the common locations of interferers . for tractability , </S>",
    "<S> prior work focuses on the two extreme cases where the interference power across antennas is either assumed to be fully correlated or fully uncorrelated . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we address this shortcoming and characterize the performance of mrc in the presence of spatially - correlated interference across antennas . modeling the interference field as a poisson point process , we derive the exact distribution of the signal - to - interference ratio ( @xmath0 ) for the case of two receive antennas , and upper and lower bounds for the general case . using these results , we study the diversity behavior of mrc and characterize the critical density of simultaneous transmissions for a given outage constraint . </S>",
    "<S> the exact @xmath0 distribution is also useful in benchmarking simpler correlation models . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the full - correlation assumption is considerably pessimistic ( up to @xmath1 higher outage probability for typical values ) and the no - correlation assumption is significantly optimistic compared to the true performance .    </S>",
