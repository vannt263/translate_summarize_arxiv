    "calculating the _ non - equilibrium _ properties of colloidal suspensions is a highly non - trivial exercise because these depend both on the short - time thermal brownian motion , and the long - time hydrodynamic behavior of the solvent  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the hydrodynamic interactions are of a many - body character , and can not usually be decomposed into a pairwise sum of inter - colloid forces .",
    "the fundamental difficulty of fully including the detailed solvent dynamics in computer simulations becomes apparent when considering the enormous _ time _ and _ length - scale _ differences between mesoscopic colloidal and microscopic solvent particles .",
    "for example , a typical colloid of diameter @xmath0 will displace on the order of @xmath1 water molecules ! furthermore , a molecular dynamics ( md ) scheme for the solvent would need to resolve time - scales on the order of @xmath2  s to describe the inter - molecular forces , while a colloid of diameter @xmath3 in water diffuses over its own diameter in about @xmath4s .    clearly , simulating even an extremely crude molecular model for the solvent on the time - scales of interest is completely out of the question : some form of _ coarse - graining _ is necessary .",
    "the object of this paper is to describe in detail one such scheme .",
    "but before we do so , we first briefly discuss a subset of the wide variety of different simulation techniques that have been devised to describe the dynamics of colloidal suspensions .    at the simplest level ,",
    "the effects of the solvent can be taken into account through brownian dynamics ( bd )  @xcite , which assumes that collisions with the solvent molecules induce a random displacement of the colloidal particle positions , as well as a local friction proportional to the their velocity .",
    "although , due to its simplicity , brownian dynamics is understandably very popular , it completely neglects momentum transport through the solvent  as described by the navier stokes equations  which leads to long - ranged hydrodynamic interactions ( hi ) between the suspended particles .",
    "these hi may fall off as slowly as @xmath5 , and can qualitatively affect the dynamical behavior of the suspension  @xcite .    beginning with the pioneering work of ermak and mccammon  @xcite , who added a simple representation of the oseen tensor  @xcite to their implementation of bd , many authors have applied computational approaches that include the hi by an approximate analytical form .",
    "the most successful of these methods is stokesian dynamics  @xcite , which can take into account higher order terms in a multipole expansion of the hi interactions .",
    "although some more sophisticated recent implementations of stokesian dynamics have achieved an @xmath6 scaling with the number of colloids  @xcite , this method is still relatively slow , and becomes difficult to implement in complex boundary conditions .",
    "another way to solve for the hi is by direct numerical simulation ( dns ) methods , where the solid particles are described by explicit boundary conditions for the navier - stokes equations  @xcite .",
    "these methods are better adapted to non - brownian particles , but can still be applied to understand the effects of hi on colloidal dynamics .",
    "the fluid particle dynamics ( fpd ) method of tanaka and araki  @xcite , and a related method by yamamoto _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , are two important recent approaches to solving the navier stokes equations that go a step beyond standard dns , and simplify the problem of boundary conditions by using a smoothed step function at the colloid surfaces . in principle brownian motion can be added to these methods  @xcite .",
    "the difficulty of including complex boundary conditions in dns approaches has stimulated the use of lattice - gas based techniques to resolve the navier stokes equations .",
    "these methods exploit the fact that only a few conditions , such as ( local ) energy and momentum conservation , need to be satisfied to allow the correct ( thermo ) hydrodynamics to emerge in the continuum limit .",
    "greatly simplified particle collision rules , easily amenable to efficient computer simulation , are therefore possible , and complex boundary conditions , such as those that characterize moving colloids , are easier to treat than in dns methods .",
    "the most popular of these techniques is lattice boltzmann ( lb ) where a linearized and pre - averaged boltzmann equation is discretized and solved on a lattice  @xcite .",
    "ladd has pioneered the application of this method to solid - fluid suspensions  @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : methods ] .",
    "the solid particles are modeled as hollow spheres , propagated with newtonian dynamics , and coupled to the lb solvent through a bounce - back collision rule on the surface .",
    "the fluctuations that lead to brownian motion were modeled by adding a stochastic term to the stress tensor . recently this has been criticized and an improved method to include brownian noise that does not suffer from some lattice induced artifacts was suggested  @xcite . a number of other groups have recently derived alternative ways of coupling a colloidal particle to a lb fluid  @xcite , in part to simulate the dynamics of charged systems .",
    "the discrete nature of lattice based methods can also bring disadvantages , particularly when treating fluids with more than one length - scale .",
    "dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd )  @xcite is a popular off - lattice alternative that includes hydrodynamics and brownian fluctuations .",
    "it can be viewed as an extension of standard newtonian md techniques , but with two important innovations : + * 1 ) * soft potentials that allow large time - steps and rapid equilibration ; + * 2 ) * a galilean invariant thermostat that locally conserves momentum and therefore generates the correct navier stokes hydrodynamics in the continuum limit .",
    "in fact , these two methodological advances can be separated .",
    "soft potentials such as those postulated for innovation * 1 ) * may indeed arise from careful _",
    "equilibrium _ coarse - graining of complex fluids  @xcite . however , their proper statistical mechanical interpretation , even for equilibrium properties , is quite subtle .",
    "for example , a potential that generates the correct pair structure will not normally reproduce the correct virial pressure due to so called _ representability problems _",
    "when used in dynamical simulations , the correct application of effective potentials is even more difficult to properly derive . for polymer dynamics , for instance",
    ", uncrossability constraints must be re - introduced to prevent coarse - grained polymers from passing through one another  @xcite .",
    "depletion interactions in a multi component solution also depend on the relative rates of depletant diffusion coefficients and particle flow velocities  @xcite . at present , therefore , the statistical mechanical origins of innovation * 1 ) * of dpd , the use of soft potentials out of equilibrium , are at best obscure . we are convinced that a correct microscopic derivation of the coarse - grained dpd representation of the dynamics , if this can indeed be done , will show that the interpretation of such soft potentials depends on dynamic as well as static ( phase - space ) averages . viewing the dpd particles as static `` clumps '' of underlying fluid",
    "is almost certainly incorrect .",
    "it may , in fact , be more fruitful to abandon simple analogies to the potential energy of a hamiltonian system , and instead view the interactions as a kind of coarse - grained self - energy  @xcite .",
    "innovation * 2 ) * , on the other hand , can be put on firmer statistical mechanical footing , see e.g.  @xcite , and can be usefully employed to study the dynamics of complex systems with other types of inter - particle interactions  @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of the dpd thermostat is that , by preserving momentum conservation , the hydrodynamic interactions that intrinsically arise from microcanonical md are preserved for calculations in the canonical ensemble .",
    "other thermostats typically screen the hydrodynamic interactions beyond a certain length - scale  @xcite . for weak damping this may not be a problem , but for strong damping it could be .",
    "simulating only the colloids with dpd ignores the dominant solvent hydrodynamics . while the solvent could be treated directly by dpd , as suggested in fig .",
    "[ fig : methods ] ( see also @xcite ) , this method is quite computationally expensive because the `` solvent '' particles interact through pairwise potentials .    in an important paper  @xcite ,",
    "lowe took these ideas further and combined the local momentum conservation of the dpd thermostat with the stochastic nature of the anderson thermostat to derive a coarse - grained scheme , now called the lowe - anderson thermostat , which is much more efficient than treating the solvent with full dpd .",
    "it has recently been applied , for example , to polymer dynamics  @xcite .",
    "independently , malevanets and kapral  @xcite derived a method now called stochastic rotation dynamics ( srd ) or also multiple particle collision dynamics ( we choose the former nomenclature here ) . in many ways",
    "it resembles the lowe - anderson thermostat  @xcite , or the much older direct simulation monte carlo ( dsmc ) method of bird  @xcite .",
    "for all three of these methods , the particles are ideal , and move in a continuous space , subject to newton s laws of motion . at discrete time - steps",
    ", a coarse - grained collision step allows particles to exchange momentum .",
    "in srd , space is partitioned into a rectangular grid , and at discrete time - steps the particles inside each cell exchange momentum by rotating their velocity vectors relative to the center of mass velocity of the cell ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : methods ] ) . similarly , in lowe",
    "s method , a particle can , with a certain probability , exchange its relative velocity with another that lies within a certain radius .",
    "one can imagine other collision rules as well .",
    "as long as they locally conserve momentum and energy , just as the lattice gas methods do , they generate the correct navier stokes hydrodynamics , although for srd it is necessary to include a grid - shift procedure to enforce galilean invariance , something first pointed out by ihle and kroll  @xcite .",
    "an important advantage of srd is that its simplified dynamics have allowed the analytic calculation of several transport coefficients  @xcite , greatly facilitating its use .",
    "in the rest of this paper we will concentrate on the srd method , although many of our general conclusions and derivations should be easily extendible to the lowe - anderson thermostat and related methods summarized in fig .  [",
    "fig : methods ] .",
    "srd can be applied to directly simulate flow , as done for example in refs  @xcite , but its stochastic nature means that a noise average must be performed to calculate flow lines , and this may make it less efficient than pre - averaged methods like lb . where srd becomes more attractive",
    "is for the simulation of complex particles embedded in a solvent .",
    "this is because in addition to long - ranged hi , it also naturally contains brownian fluctuations , and both typically need to be resolved for a proper statistical mechanical treatment of the dynamics of mesoscopic suspended particles .",
    "for example , srd has been used to study polymers under flow  @xcite , the effect of hydrodynamics on protein folding and polymer collapse  @xcite , and the conformations of vesicles under flow  @xcite . in each of the previously mentioned examples , the suspended particles",
    "are coupled to the solvent by participating in the collision step .",
    "a less coarse - grained coupling can be achieved by allowing direct collisions , obeying newton s laws of motion , between the srd solvent and the suspended particles .",
    "such an approach is important for systems , such as colloidal suspensions , where the solvent and colloid time and length - scales need to be clearly separated .",
    "malevanets and kapral  @xcite derived such a hybrid algorithm that combined a full md scheme of the solute - solute and solute - solvent interactions , while treating the solvent - solvent interactions via srd .",
    "early applications were to a two - dimensional many - particle system  @xcite , and to the aggregation of colloidal particles  @xcite .",
    "we have recently extended this approach , and applied it to the sedimentation of up to 800 hard sphere ( hs ) like colloids as a function of volume fraction , for a number of different values of the peclet number  @xcite . to achieve these simulations we adapted the method of malevanets and kapral  @xcite in a number of ways",
    "that were only briefly described in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the current paper",
    "we provide more in depth analysis of the simulation method we used , and describe some potential pitfalls .",
    "in particular we focus on the different time and length - scales that arise from our coarse - graining approach , as well as the role of dimensionless hydrodynamic numbers that express the relative importance of competing physical phenomena . very recently",
    ", another similar study of colloidal sedimentation and aggregation has been carried out  @xcite .",
    "some of our results and analysis are similar , but some are different , and we will mention these where appropriate .",
    "after the introductory overview above , we begin in section  [ solvent ] by carefully describing the properties of a pure srd fluid , focusing on simple derivations that highlight the dominant physics involved for each transport coefficient .",
    "section  [ colloid ] explains how to implement the coupling of a colloidal particle to an srd solvent bath , and shows how to avoid spurious depletion interactions and how to understand lubrication forces . in section  [ dimensionless ]",
    "we analyze how optimizing the efficiency of particle based coarse - graining schemes affects different dimensionless hydrodynamic numbers , such as the schmidt number , the mach number , the reynolds number , the knudsen number , and the peclet number .",
    "section  [ time - scales ] describes the hierarchy of time - scales that determine the physics of a colloidal suspension , and compares these to the compressed hierarchy in our coarse - grained method . in section  [ mapping ]",
    "we tackle the question of how to map from a coarse - grained simulation , optimized for computational efficiency , to a real colloidal system .",
    "finally after a conclusions section , we include a few appendices that discuss amongst other things how to thermostat the srd system ( appendix i ) ; why the popular langevin equation without memory effects does a remarkably poor job of capturing both the long and the short time dynamics of the colloidal velocity auto - correlation function ( appendix ii ) ; and , finally , how various physical properties and dimensionless numbers scale for an srd simulation , and how these compare to a colloid of radius 10 nm or 1 @xmath7 m in h@xmath80 ( appendix iii ) .",
    "in srd , the solvent is represented by a large number @xmath9 of particles of mass @xmath10 . here and in the following , we will call these `` fluid '' particles , with the caveat that , however tempting , they should not be viewed as some kind of composite particles or clusters made up of the underlying ( molecular ) fluid . instead",
    ", srd should be interpreted as a navier stokes solver that includes thermal noise .",
    "the particles are merely a convenient computational device to facilitate the coarse - graining of the fluid properties .      in the first ( propagation ) step of the algorithm , the positions and velocities of the fluid particles are propagated for a time @xmath11 ( the time between collision steps ) by accurately integrating newton s equations of motion , @xmath12 @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the position and velocity of fluid particle @xmath15 , respectively while @xmath16 is the total ( external ) force on particle @xmath15 , which may come from an external field such as gravity , or fixed boundary conditions such as hard walls , or moving boundary conditions such as suspended colloids .",
    "the direct forces between pairs of fluid particles are , however , neglected in the propagation step .",
    "herein lies the main advantage  the origin of the efficiency  of srd . instead of directly treating the interactions between the fluid particles ,",
    "a coarse - grained collision step is performed at each time - step @xmath17 : first , space is partitioned into cubic cells of volume @xmath18 .",
    "next , for each cell , the particle velocities relative to the center of mass velocity @xmath19 of the cell are rotated : @xmath20 @xmath21 is a rotation matrix which rotates velocities by a fixed angle @xmath22 around a randomly oriented axis .",
    "the aim of the collision step is to transfer momentum between the fluid particles while conserving the total momentum and energy of each cell .",
    "both the collision and the streaming step conserve phase - space volume , and it has been shown that the single particle velocity distribution evolves to a maxwell - boltzmann distribution  @xcite .    the rotation procedure can thus be viewed as a coarse - graining of particle collisions over space _ and _ time . because mass , momentum , and energy are conserved locally , the correct hydrodynamic ( navier stokes ) equations are captured in the continuum limit , _ including _ the effect of thermal noise  @xcite .    at low temperatures or small collision times @xmath17 , the transport coefficients of srd , as originally formulated  @xcite , show anomalies caused by the fact that fluid particles in a given cell can remain in that cell and participate in several collision steps  @xcite . under these circumstances",
    "the assumption of molecular chaos and galilean invariance are incorrect .",
    "however , this anomaly can be cured by applying a random shift of the cell coordinates before the collision step  @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that the collision step in srd does not locally conserve angular momentum . as a consequence , the stress tensor @xmath23 is not , in general , a symmetric function of the derivatives of the flow field ( although it is still rotationally symmetric )  @xcite .",
    "the asymmetric part can be interpreted as a viscous stress associated with the vorticity @xmath24 of the velocity field @xmath25 .",
    "the stress tensor will therefore depend on the amount of vorticity in the flow field .",
    "however , the total force on a fluid element is determined not by the stress tensor itself , but by its divergence @xmath26 , which is what enters the navier stokes equations .",
    "taking the divergence causes the explicit vorticity dependence to drop out ( the gradient of a curl is zero ) . in principle",
    ", the stress tensor could be made symmetric by applying random rotations as well as random translations to the cell . or ,",
    "alternatively , angular momentum can be explicitly conserved by dynamically adapting the collision rule , as done by ryder _",
    "@xcite , who found no significant differences in fluid properties ( although there is , of course , less flexibility in choosing simulation parameters ) .",
    "this result has been confirmed by some recent theoretical calculations  @xcite , that demonstrate that the asymmetry of the stress tensor has only a few consequences , such as a correction to the sound wave attenuation associated with viscous dissipation of longitudinal density waves . these are not important for the fluid properties we are trying to model , and so , on balance , we chose not to implement possible fixes to improve on angular momentum conservation .",
    "the simplicity of srd collisions has facilitated the analytical calculation of many transport coefficients  @xcite .",
    "these analytical expressions are particularly useful because they enable us to efficiently tune the viscosity and other properties of the fluid , without the need for trial and error simulations . in this section",
    "we will summarize a number of these transport coefficients , where possible giving a simple derivation of the dominant physics .",

    "moreover , it has been shown  @xcite that the effective hydrodynamic particle radius is approximately given by @xmath73 .",

    "when two surfaces approach one another , they must displace the fluid between them , while if they move apart , fluid must flow into the space freed up between the surfaces . at very short inter - surface distances , this results in so - called lubrication forces , which are repulsive for colloids approaching each other , and attractive for colloids moving apart  @xcite .",
    "these forces are expected to be particularly important for driven dense colloidal suspensions ; see e.g.  @xcite for a recent review .",
    "an additional advantage of our choice of diameters @xmath144 above is that more fluid particles will fit in the space between two colloids , and consequently the lubrication forces will be more accurately represented .",

    "an explicit analytic correction could be applied to properly resolve these forces for very small distances , as was recently implemented for lattice boltzmann  @xcite .",

    "if there are thermodynamic finite - size effects ( for example due to a long correlation length caused by proximity to a critical point ) , then a correct simulation technique will show the same behaviour regardless of the underlying dynamics .",
    "different regimes of hydrodynamic behavior can be characterized by a series of dimensionless numbers that indicate the relative strengths of competing physical processes  @xcite .",

    "above , we have only discussed setting lengths and times .",
    "this leaves either the mass @xmath10 or temperature ( thermal energy ) @xmath28 still to be set . because for many dynamic properties the absolute mass is effectively an irrelevant variable ( although relative masses may not be ) there is some freedom to choose .",
    "one possibility would be to set @xmath41 , the mass of the colloid , equal to the physical mass . for an @xmath293 m neutrally buoyant colloid this sets @xmath392 g , ( equal to about @xmath393 water molecules ) while for an @xmath364 nm colloid we find @xmath394 g ( equal to about @xmath395 water molecules ) . by construction this procedure produces the correct physical @xmath396 .",
    "if we fix time with @xmath294 , this will therefore also generate the correct shear viscosity @xmath93 .",

    "means that the unit of thermal energy @xmath397 would also be very large , leading to the appearance of very low temperatures .",
    "however , because temperature only determines behavior through the way it scales potentials , it is quite easy to simply re - normalize the effective energy scales and obtain the same behavior as for the physical system .",
    "alternatively one could set the temperature equal to that of a physical system , but that would mean that the masses would again differ significantly from the real physical system . at any rate , for the same simulation ( say of sedimentation at a given value of pe ) the values of mass or temperature depend on the physical system one",
    "compares to .",
    "this apparent ambiguity ( or flexibility ) simply reflects the fact that the dominant effects of temperature and mass come into play as relative ratios and not as absolute values .",
    "so far we have only treated one length - scale in the problem , the radius @xmath74 .",
    "implicitly we have therefore assumed that the colloid - colloid interaction does not have another intrinsic length - scale of its own .",
    "for hard - sphere colloids this is strictly true , and for steep - repulsions such as the wca form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : col - col ] ) it is also a fairly good assumption that the exact choice of the exponent @xmath112 in this equation does not significantly affect the dynamical properties  @xcite .",
    "similarly , there is some freedom to set the repulsive fluid - colloid potential of eq .",
    "( [ eq : col - fluid ] ) in such a way as to optimize the simulation parameters , in particular @xmath35 .",
    "the physical liquid - colloid interaction would obviously have a much more complex form , but srd coarse - grains out such details .",
    "a similar argument can be made for colloid and fluid interactions with hard walls , needed , for example , to study problems with confinement , for which , _",
    "inter alia _ , srd is particularly well suited .",
    "things become more complicated for colloids with an explicit attractive interaction , such as dlvo or a depletion potential  @xcite .",
    "these potentials introduce a new length - scale , the range of the attraction .",
    "the ratio of this length to the hard - core diameter helps determine the equilibrium properties of the fluid  @xcite . in a physical system",
    "this ratio may be quite small . keeping the ratio",
    "the same in the simulations then leads to potentials that are very steep on the scale of @xmath36 .",
    "the md time - step @xmath35 may need to be very small in order to properly integrate the md equations of motion .",
    "such a small @xmath398 can make a simulation very inefficient , as was found in  @xcite who followed this strategy and were forced to use @xmath399 . however , in that case the dlvo potential dominates the behaviour , so that srd was only included to roughly resolve the long range hydrodynamics@xcite . in general",
    ", we advocate adapting the potential to maximize simulation efficiency , while preserving key physical properties such as the topology of the phase diagram . for example",
    ", the attractive energy scale can be set by the dimensionless reduced second virial coefficient , which gives an excellent approximation for how far one is from the liquid - liquid critical point  @xcite .",
    "when the attractive interaction range is less than about @xmath400 of the colloid hard - core diameter , the colloidal `` liquid '' phase becomes metastable with respect to the fluid - solid phase - transition . at low colloid packing fraction",
    "@xmath155 this leads to so - called `` energetic fluid '' behavior  @xcite . to simulate a colloidal suspension in this `` energetic fluid '' regime , having a range of less than @xmath401 of @xmath74 should suffice",
    "in this way adding attractions does not have to make the simulation much less efficient .",
    "moreover the effects of these constraints , placed by the colloid - colloid interaction on @xmath398 , are to some degree mitigated by the fact that it is usually the colloid - fluid interaction which sets this time - scale .",
    "there are still a few final subtleties to mention .",
    "first of all , using small @xmath145 in the simulations may greatly increase efficiency , but it also leads to a relatively larger contribution of the enskog friction to the total friction in eq .",
    "( [ eq_xi ] ) . for physical colloids in a molecular solvent",
    "the exact magnitude of the enskog friction is still an open question , but undoubtedly for larger colloids it is almost negligible .",
    "some of the enskog effects can simply be absorbed into an effective hydrodynamic radius @xmath74 , but others must be interpreted with some care .",
    "another regime where we might expect to see deviations beyond a simple re - scaling of time - scales would be at very short times .",
    "for example , when colloids form a crystal , their oscillations can be de - composed into lattice phonons .",
    "all but the longest wave - length longitudinal oscillations are overdamped due to the viscous drag and backflow effects of the solvent  @xcite . in srd , however , some of the very short wavelength oscillations might be preserved due to the fact that the motion on those time - scales is still ballistic .",
    "these may have an impact on the interpretation of srd simulations of microrheology .    in summary",
    ", these examples demonstrate that as long as the coarse - grained simulation produces the correct hydrodynamic and brownian behavior then there is considerable freedom in assigning real physical values to the parameters in the simulation .",
    "attractive interactions may introduce a new length - scale , but a judicious choice of a model potential should still reproduce the correct physical behavior .",
    "the same simulation may therefore be mapped onto multiple different physical systems .",
    "conversely , for the same physical system , different choices can be made for the time - scales that are mapped to physical values , but by design , not all time - scales can be simultaneously resolved .",
    "correctly rendering the principal brownian and hydrodynamic properties of colloids in solution is a challenging task for computer simulation . in this article",
    "we have explored how treating the solvent with srd , which coarse - grains the collisions between solvent particles over both time _ and _ space , leads to an efficient solution of the thermo - hydrodynamic equations of the solvent , in the external field provided by the colloids .",
    "although it is impossible to simulate the entire range of time - scales encountered in real colloidal suspensions , which can span as much as 15 orders of magnitude , we argue that this is also not necessary . instead , by recognizing firstly that hydrodynamic effects are governed by a set of dimensionless numbers , and",
    "secondly that the full hierarchy of time - scales can be telescoped down to a much more manageable range while still being properly physically separated , we demonstrate that the key brownian and hydrodynamic properties of a colloidal suspension can indeed be captured by our srd based coarse - graining scheme .    in particular , to simulate in the colloidal regime",
    ", the modeler should ensure that the dimensionless hydrodynamic numbers such as the mach , reynolds and knudsen numbers are small enough ( @xmath192 ) , and the schmidt number is large enough ( @xmath170 ) .",
    "while these numbers are constrained by approximate limits , the peclet number , which measures the relative strength of the convective transport to the diffusive transport of the colloids , can be either larger or smaller than 1 , depending on physical properties such as the colloidal size and the strength of the external field that one wants to study .",
    "it turns out that if the hydrodynamic numbers above are chosen correctly , it is usually not so difficult to also satisfy the proper separation of the time - scales .",
    "we explored how to reach the desired regime of hydrodynamic numbers and time - scales by tuning the simulation parameters .",
    "the two most important parameters are the dimensionless mean - free path @xmath102 which measures what fraction of a cell size @xmath27 an srd particle travels between collisions performed at every time - step @xmath17 , and the ratio of the colloid radius @xmath38 to the srd cell size @xmath27 .",
    "the general picture that emerges is that the collision time @xmath17 must be chosen so that @xmath102 is small since this helps keep the schmidt number high , and both the knudsen and reynolds numbers low .",
    "of course for computational efficiency , the collision time should not be too small either . similarly",
    "although a larger colloid radius means that the hydrodynamic fields are more accurately rendered , this should be tempered by the fact that the simulation efficiency drops off rapidly with increasing colloid radius .",
    "we find that choosing @xmath402 , which may seem small , already leads to accurate hydrodynamic properties .",
    "a number of subtleties occur at the fluid - colloid interface , which may induce spurious depletion interactions between the colloids , but these can be avoided by careful choice of potential parameters for slip boundary conditions . stick boundary conditions can also be implemented , and we advocate using stochastic bounce - back rules to achieve this coarse - graining over the fluid - colloid interactions .    the simplicity of the srd solvent facilitates the calculation of the the short - time behavior of the vacf from kinetic theory .",
    "we argue that for times shorter than the sonic time @xmath403 , where hydrodynamic collective modes will not yet have fully developed , the decay of the vacf is typically much more rapid than the prediction of the simple langevin equation .",
    "the ensuing enskog contribution to the total friction should be added in parallel to the microscopic hydrodynamic friction , and from the sum an analytic expression for the effective hydrodynamic radius @xmath248 can be derived which is consistent with independent measurements of the long - ranged hydrodynamic fields .    although we have shown how to correctly render the principal brownian and hydrodynamic behavior of colloids in solution",
    "there is , as always , _ no such thing as a free lunch_. the price to be paid is an inevitable consequence of compressing together the hierarchy of time and length - scales : not all the simulation parameters can be simultaneously mapped onto a physical system of interest .",
    "however the cost of the `` lunch '' can be haggled down by recognizing that only a few physical parameters are usually important .",
    "for example , one could map the simulation onto real physical time , say through @xmath216 and @xmath297 , or alternatively through @xmath294 ; there is some freedom ( or ambiguity ) in the choice of which time scale to use .",
    "the correspondence with physical reality becomes more complex when different physical time - scales mix , but in practice they can often be disentangled when both the coarse - grained simulation and the physical system are expressed in terms of dimensionless numbers and ratios .",
    "in other words , there is no substitute for careful physical insight which is , as always , priceless .",
    "a number of lessons can be drawn from this exercise that may be relevant for other coarse - graining schemes .",
    "srd is closely related to lattice - boltzmann and to the lowe - anderson thermostat , and many of the conclusions above should transfer in an obvious way .",
    "for dissipative particle dynamics , we argue that the physical interpretation is facilitated by recognizing that , just as for srd , the dpd particles should not be viewed as `` clumps of fluid '' but rather as a convenient computational tool to solve the underlying thermo - hydrodynamic equations .",
    "all these methods must correctly resolve the time - scale hierarchy , and satisfy the relevant hydrodynamic numbers , in order to reproduce the right underlying physics .",
    "our measurements of the vacf and the discussion in appendix b show explicitly that brownian dynamics simulations , which are based on the simple langevin equation , do not correctly capture either the long or the short - time decay of colloidal vacfs .",
    "a major advantage of srd is the relative ease with which solutes and external boundary conditions ( walls ) are introduced .",
    "boundaries may be hard or soft , with either stick or slip conditions .",
    "this method is therefore particularly promising for simulations in the fields of bio- and nanofluidics , where small meso particles flow in constrained geometries , possibly confined by soft fluctuating walls .",
    "we are currently exploring these possibilities .",

    "when an external field is applied to the fluid ( or to objects embedded in the fluid ) , energy is pumped into the system and , as a consequence , the average temperature will rise . to prevent this from happening , the system must be coupled to a thermostat . in order not to influence the average flow , thermostating requires a local and galilean invariant definition of temperature .",
    "we achieve this by relating the instantaneous local temperature in a cell to the mean square deviation of the fluid particle velocities from the center of mass velocity of that cell . to minimize interference of the thermostat with the dynamics",
    ", we choose to measure the overall temperature as : @xmath404 in eq .",

    "the temperature @xmath407 is measured every @xmath17 ( this can be done very efficiently because the relative velocities are readily available in the collision step routine ) .",
    "the thermostat then acts by rescaling all relative velocities @xmath408 by a factor @xmath409 .",
    "this strict enforcement of the overall temperature may be relaxed by allowing appropriate fluctuations , but in view of the very large number of fluid particles ( typically @xmath410 ) this will not have a measurable effect on the dynamics of the fluid particles .",
    "within the brownian approximation each cartesian component of the colloid velocity @xmath336 is described by a simple langevin equation of the form : @xmath411 without any memory effect in the friction coefficient @xmath194 , or in the random force @xmath412 .",
    "this langevin equation fundamentally arises from the assumption that the force - kicks are markovian : each step is independent of any previous behavior .",

    "<S> we describe in detail how to implement a coarse - grained hybrid molecular dynamics and stochastic rotation dynamics simulation technique that captures the combined effects of brownian and hydrodynamic forces in colloidal suspensions . the importance of carefully tuning the simulation parameters to correctly resolve the multiple time and length - scales of this problem is emphasized . </S>",
    "<S> we systematically analyze how our coarse - graining scheme resolves dimensionless hydrodynamic numbers such as the reynolds number re , which indicates the importance of inertial effects , the schmidt number sc , which indicates whether momentum transport is liquid - like or gas - like , the mach number ma , which measures compressibility effects , the knudsen number kn , which describes the importance of non - continuum molecular effects and the peclet number pe , which describes the relative effects of convective and diffusive transport . with these dimensionless numbers in the correct regime </S>",
    "<S> the many brownian and hydrodynamic time - scales can be telescoped together to maximize computational efficiency while still correctly resolving the physically relevant physical processes . </S>",
    "<S> we also show how to control a number of numerical artifacts , such as finite size effects and solvent induced attractive depletion interactions . </S>",
    "<S> when all these considerations are properly taken into account , the measured colloidal velocity auto - correlation functions and related self diffusion and friction coefficients compare quantitatively with theoretical calculations . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , these calculations demonstrate that , notwithstanding its seductive simplicity , the basic langevin equation does a remarkably poor job of capturing the decay rate of the velocity auto - correlation function in the colloidal regime , strongly underestimating it at short times and strongly overestimating it at long times . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss in detail how to map the parameters of our method onto physical systems , and from this extract more general lessons  keeping in mind that there is no such thing as a free lunch  that may be relevant for other coarse - graining schemes such as lattice boltzmann or dissipative particle dynamics . </S>"
