    "wbt and wbp have mass - dependent term in the @xmath17-shell  @xcite . going from @xmath4o to @xmath112o , the @xmath17 shell interaction decreases , which makes the nuclei less binding .",

    "we will discuss more about the contribution of @xmath5 states later .    in order to see if the prediction on the neutron drip line is sensitive to the center - of - mass parameter , @xmath12 , we have made calculations with assuming three different values of the parameter .",

    "we note that constant and smaller effective charges work quite well in the present study , which may attributed to the small size of the @xmath8he core also .",
