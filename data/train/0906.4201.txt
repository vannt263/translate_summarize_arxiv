    "investigation of neutron reflection from multilayers belongs to the field of nanostructure research .",
    "magnetic multilayered systems with magnetization vector varying in space can be grown artificially by consecutive evaporation or sputtering techniques of magnetic layers with different coercivity , or they can appear naturally under the action of anisotropic exchange forces  @xcite .",
    "a representative example is a soft - magnetic layer ( sl ) which is magnetically coupled to a hard - magnetic layer ( hl )  @xcite , when the last one is magnetized non parallel with respect to the external field orientation . as a result",
    ", the sl becomes virtually separated into magnetic layers with different orientations of the magnetization vector , which turns from a direction almost parallel to the external field to a direction defined by the hl magnetization vector .",
    "this turn can go along a spiral , giving rise to a helicoidal structure , often referred to as spring magnet , or this turn can be confined in the plane perpendicular to the sample interface . in the last case , the magnetization in the sl is fan - like , and is referred to as perpendicular exchange - spring multilayer  @xcite .",
    "neutron scattering on helicoidal structures was investigated in ref .",
    "here we consider the neutron scattering on a fan - like system .",
    "such a magnetic state in fact consists of a large number of magnetic layers with magnetization slightly turned with respect to each other , and the neutron scattering on them can be calculated numerically by making use of generalized matrix methods  @xcite .",
    "however it is possible to model the fan - like system by a magnet with continuous rotation of the magnetization vector , and to calculate neutron scattering on it analytically .",
    "we show here that neutron scattering on fan - like and helicoidal magnets are very similar .",
    "for instance , reflection curves for both configurations exhibit a resonance in some range of values of the normal wave vector component of the incident neutrons .    in the next section",
    "we find an analytical solution of the schrdinger equation in a homogeneous medium with fan - like magnetization . in section iii",
    "we calculate analytically the polarized neutron reflectivities from a semi - infinite magnetic media with fan - like magnetization in the absence of an external field . in this case",
    ", the quantization axis for the neutron spin @xmath0 is chosen along the axis @xmath1 of the magnetization rotation , and the neutron scattering becomes dependent on correlation @xmath2 , which violates time parity conservation and detailed balance theorem .    in section",
    "iv we find analytical expressions for reflectivity from a magnetic slab of finite thickness , also in the absence of an external field .",
    "the results are further used in section v to calculate the neutron reflection from a magnetic film with fan - like magnetic state and nonzero external field . in section",
    "vi we consider a sl / hl magnetic heterostructure and calculate the neutron reflectivity curves from the front side and from the back side of the sample , respectively like in the  @xcite experiment . finally , the results are summarized in section vii .",

    "our task is to find the neutron reflection from such a system .",

    "we included a mismatch phase @xmath16 , which characterizes the angle between the external and the internal magnetic fields at the interface of the medium . in the real class of perpendicular exchange - spring magnetic multilayers",
    "@xcite the magnetization changes stepwise via magnetic domains with slightly turned magnetization , but for analytical calculations we can approximate such a change by a model of a continuous rotation of this magnetization .",

    "it can be elucidated by analogy with the neutron propagation in a homogeneous magnetic field @xmath31 directed , say , along @xmath5-axis .",

    "the resonant spin flip reflection from samples with rotating field ( see also  @xcite ) shows some features , which are very important with respect to fundamental principles .",
    "reflectivity and transmissivity of samples with a field rotating around a @xmath1 vector contain a t - odd correlation @xmath2 , where @xmath0 is the incident neutron spin polarization .",
    "it looks as if there is a violation of the time reverse invariance .",
    "however more detailed considerations  @xcite show that the operator of the time reverse applied to the spinor wave function , containing t - odd terms , gives a new wave function , which is an exact solution of the time reversed hamiltonian even in presence of absorption ( imaginary part of the hamiltonian ) .",
    "it proves that the t - invariance is not violated notwithstanding that the wave function contains the t - odd correlation .",
    "this example , however is very useful .",
    "it shows that observation in an experiment of t - odd or p - odd correlations should not be accepted as a proof of violation of p- or t - invariance .    in our problem",
    "we meet also violation of the detailed balance principle , related to the principle of maximal entropy . according to this principle",
    "the flux reflected with spin flip from the initial state @xmath202 is to be equal to the flux reflected with spin flip from the initial state @xmath203 .",
    "such equality is necessary because , if the mirror would be immersed in an isotropic distribution of unpolarized neutrons , the reflectivity would neither change the isotropy nor create polarization . in the case of the mirror with a rotating field",
    "it is not so .",
    "the neutrons in the state @xmath202 are reflected almost totally with spin flip , while the oppositely polarized neutrons are not reflected .",
    "it seems that , if we take a vessel with isotropic unpolarized neutron gas and partition it off by a magnetized foil with a rotating magnetization ( helicoidal , fan - like or some other ) then the neutrons from , say , the left part of the vessel will spill completely polarized through the foil into the right part of the vessel . indeed the neutrons in the left part , which are polarized along @xmath118 , after reflection become polarized along @xmath156 and these neutrons are easily transmitted without depolarization into the right side .",
    "so all the neutrons will go to the right side and they will be polarized along @xmath156 .",
    "however such a terrible violation of the maximal entropy principle does not happen , because for neutrons on the right side of the foil the field in the foil looks rotating in the opposite direction , therefore the states @xmath203 are reflected almost totally with spin flip , and the states @xmath202 are easily transmitted to the left side .",
    "nevertheless there appears a cycle in the phase space , which violates principle of the detailed balance .",
    "this violation is attributed to presence of rotation in space .",
    "if there were two opposite rotations the space could be considered having an equilibrium state , and the detailed balance would be not violated , with a single hand rotation the space is not in the equilibrium , and because of that the detailed balance is violated .",
    "we have obtained analytical expressions for calculation of reflectivities and transmissivity of neutrons through magnetic media with fan - like and helicoidal magnetization .",
    "the calculations show that at wave numbers in the interval @xmath204 , where @xmath69 is the fan vector ( rotation vector of the fan ) , and @xmath67 is the internal magnetic field of the fan , the reflection curve contains a resonance peak .",
    "this feature serves as an identification of magnetic configurations with intrinsic rotating fields .",
    "the width of the peak characterizes the uniformity of rotation and the strength of the rotating field .",
    "the analytical solutions and the numerical generalized matrix method are very useful tools for analyzing polarized neutron reflectivity data from non - collinear magnets exhibiting anisotropic exchange forces .",
    "the time parity violation found in this model shows that observation of such an effect in some experiment must be analyzed in order to exclude the presence of magnetic fields , which may rotate in the sample space .",
