    "since discovery of the sunspots by galileo , genesis of their 22 year cyclic activity in general and , their formation and decay during their evolutionary stages in particular still remain a mystery .",
    "the study of sunspots origin , formation and decay is important owing to the observed fact that variation of sunspot occurrence activity is related with the solar irradiance that in turn affects the earth s environment and the climate ( prabhakaran nayar _ et .",
    "_ 2002 ; hiremath and mandi 2004 ; soon 2005 ; badruddin , singh and singh 2006 ; perry 2007 ; feymann 2007 ; tiwari and ramesh 2007 and references there in ; scafetta and west 2008 komitov 2009 , hiremath 2009b and references there in ) .",
    "present general consensus is that the sunspots originate below the solar surface due to an unknown dynamo mechanism .",
    "due to very high conductivity of the solar plasma and assuming that raising flux tube does not acquires extra flux from the ambient medium , sunspots isorotate with the internal plasma and due to buoyancy raise toward the surface along the path of rotational isocontours .",
    "this implies that sunspots are very good tracers of the internal dynamics and structure of the solar interior . hence if the sunspots that have first and second days appearance on the surface , and if one computes their initial rotation rates , then one can infer rotation rate of the internal solar plasma where the sunspots foot points are anchored .",
    "recent studies ( javaraiah and gokhale 1997 ; javaraiah 2001 ; hiremath 2002 ; sivaraman _ et .",
    "_ 2003 ) show that variation of initial rotation rates obtained from the daily motion of sunspot groups with respect to their life spans on the surface is almost similar to the radial variation of the internal rotation profile of the solar plasma .",
    "[ sunspot_area_age ]    from hiremath s ( 2002 ) paper , results are reproduced in fig 1 that illustrates a comparison between the variation of initial rotation rates of the sunspot groups for different life spans and radial variation of internal rotation profile as inferred ( antia , basu and chitre 1998 ) from the helioseismology .",
    "note the striking similarity between these two profiles . in order to reach closer to the reality of the physics of convection zone and dynamics of the flux tubes , in the same study , the rate of change of initial rotation rates of the sunspot groups ( that represent the acceleration or deceleration of the flux tubes in the ambient plasma )",
    "are compared ( the fig 5(b ) of hiremath ( 2002 ) with the radial profile of gradient of rotation that is computed from the radial variation of rotation of the plasma inferred from the helioseismology ) .",
    "again we get a striking similarity between these profiles . to conclude from that study , for different life spans , initial sunspot dynamics over the surface represents the internal dynamics in different layers of the convection zone .",
    "for example initial anchoring of a flux tube whose life span is 10 days is near base of the convection zone and initial anchoring of a flux tube whose life span is 5 days is in the middle of the convective envelope .",
    "observations show that there are three important stages in the sunspot s evolutionary history : ( i ) a well developed sunspot ( that consists of umbra and penumbra ) is formed due to coalescing of the emerging flux regions , ( ii ) once stabilized sunspot is formed , its area increases and reach the maximum value and , ( iii ) decay of the sunspot from it s maximum area to minimum area and ultimately disintegrating into smaller active regions and diffusion of the flux on the surface .    as for the first and last stages , there are many studies that explain the formation and decay parts of the sunspot s evolutionary history .",
    "the first stage is supposed to be due to convective collapse , a kind of instability that has been invoked to explain the kilo gauss fields on the surface ( parker 1978 ; spruit 1979 ; hasan 1985 ) .",
    "once flux element is formed , different adjacent flux elements coalesce and sunspot is formed . owing to their strong magnetic field structure , sunspots inhibit the ambient convection resulting in reduction of temperature and density",
    ". ultimately lower density of the flux tube results in raising ( due to buoyancy ) from the convection zone to the surface .",
    "contrary to this conventional view , parker ( 1992 ) has proposed that sunspots are basically formed due to coalescence of magnetic elements by the vortices . according to him ,",
    "flux tubes are surrounded by vortex flows that attract other vortices leading to coalescence of different flux elements . on the other hand meyer _",
    "al . _ ( 1974 ) , have different view on the formation of the flux tubes . according to them a strong converging flow is necessary to form the sunspots .",
    "that means sunspots might be formed at the boundary of the convective cells , with an outflow at the surface and an inflow in the deeper layers . where as hiremath ( 2009b ; 2010 ) , by updating alfven s ( 1943 ) seminal idea of sunspot formation , came to the conclusion that sunspots are formed due to superposition of alfven wave perturbations of the underlying steady part of large scale toroidal magnetic field structure and travel along isorotational contours in order to reach at the proper activity belt on the surface .",
    "there are many studies on the decaying phase of the sunspot . cowling ( 1946 )",
    "was the first person to investigate the decay part of the sunspot area .",
    "bumba ( 1963 ) obtained a linear decay law for the recurrent spot groups and exponential decay law for the non - recurrent spot groups . where as some of the previous studies ( petrovay and moreno - insertis 1997 ; petrovay and van driel - gesztelyi 1997 ) indicate the quadratic decay ( _ i.e. _ , sunspot area as quadratic function of time ) and other studies ( solanki 2003 and references there in ) indicate the linear decay law .",
    "moreno - insertis and vazquez ( 1988 ) and martinez pillet , moreno - insertis and vazquez ( 1993 ) conclude that the present sunspot data do not allow any distinction between either linear or quadratic decay law . to add to these decay laws , log - normal distribution ( martinez pillet ,",
    "moreno - insertis and vazquez 1993 ) also fit the decay of umbrae .",
    "there are following theoretical studies to understand the sunspot decay .",
    "first theoretical study in supporting the results of linear decay laws is by zwan and gokhale ( 1972 ) .",
    "such a linear decay law suggests that flux loss takes place everywhere within the spot irrespective of their different sizes .",
    "zwan and gokhale ( 1972 ) assumed a current sheet around the sunspot and turbulent diffusion inside the tube . in this case",
    "ohmic diffusion dictates the decay of the current sheet and hence as spot decays to smaller area , thickness of the current sheet reduces .",
    "in fact such current sheets around the sunspots have been observed by solanki , rueedi and livingston ( 1992 ) .",
    "in contrast , simon and leighton ( 1964 ) and schmidt ( 1968 ) propose that the sunspots are decayed by the erosion of the sunspot boundary which implies that @xmath14 is proportional to @xmath15 , where a is area of spot .",
    "supporting the erosion model , petrovay and moreno - insertis ( 1997 ) proposed that turbulent diffusivity depends strongly on the field strength .",
    "their model predicts the quadratic decay and spontaneous current sheet around the sunspot .",
    "though there are many studies on the first and last phases of the sunspot evolution , the second stage of a sunspot , viz . , physics of a growth phase , during it s life time is not understood",
    "moreover , it is not clear whether all the three phases in a sunspot s life time remain same or different over the whole solar cycle .",
    "that means : is there any year to year variations in the area gradients ( rate of change of area @xmath14 with respect to time , where a(t ) is time dependent area of the sunspots and @xmath8 is time variable ) of the sunspots during it s increasing ( second phase ) and decaying ( last phase ) ? is there any connection between the evolutionary history of the sunspots and underlying deeper dynamics or this phenomenon is simply due to surface convection .",
    "some of these important issues are addressed in this study .    as for year to year changes in gradient of sunspots area , for the year 1955 - 1965 and for different life spans , hiremath ( 2005 , with summer student mr .",
    "subba rao ) , computed both growth @xmath16 and the decay @xmath17 rates of the sunspots and came to the following conclusions .",
    "for the same life span , to reach their maximum areas sunspots take different times as cycle progresses .",
    "that is , in the beginning of the cycle , area - age curves are nearly gaussian and as cycle progresses area - age curve follow the simple linear decay law .",
    "further they conclude : ( i ) during the beginning of the solar cycle , sunspots _ rate of growth _ and _ rate of decay _ are larger compared at end of the solar cycle , ( ii ) in the beginning of the solar cycle , in order to reach their maximum areas , sunspots increase their area at a rate of @xmath18 100 mh ( millionths hemisphere)/day where as at the end of solar cycle sunspots increase their area at the rate of @xmath18 50 mh / day and , ( iii ) sunspots decay faster ( @xmath18 75 mh / day ) in the beginning of the solar cycle compared to the end of the solar cycle ( @xmath18 25 mh / day ) .",
    "the last conclusion is similar to the conclusion from the recent study ( hathaway and choudhary 2008 ) on decay of area of the sunspot groups .",
    "active regions are centers of solar activity ranging from flares to cmes .",
    "they are believed to be locations where magnetic flux bundles erupt from deep interior in the convection zone to emerge at solar surface in the form of sunspots due to magnetic buoyancy .",
    "further the complexity of sunspot groups plays an important role in determining the active regions ( zirin 1988 ) .",
    "the difference in the total energy output between a solar minimum and maximum , indirectly associated with the sunspots , is about 0.1% .",
    "even this small energy changes in the sun s output over 11-year solar cycle can intensify wind and rainfall activities and therefore has a major impact on global weather and climatic patterns in the earth s climatic parameters .",
    "therefore it is useful to investigate how the sunspot groups themselves eventually grow and decay .",
    "the growth and decay of sunspot groups also play an important role in the day to day irradiance variations ( wilson 1981 ) .",
    "if decay of sunspots were purely by ohmic dissipation , sunspots would have lifetimes of about 300 years by considering their size and photospheric conductivity ( cowling 1946 ) .",
    "however , the sunspots have shorter life span of @xmath18 weeks for non - recurrent spot groups and @xmath18 months for recurrent spot groups . how to reconcile these observed phenomena , viz .",
    ", three phases of formation , growth and decay of the sunspots .",
    "in the recent study ( hiremath 2009b ; hiremath 2010 ) , it is proposed that sunspots are formed by the superposition of many alfven wave perturbations of the embedded toroidal magnetic field structure .",
    "once sunspots are formed , due to buoyancy , at different depths in the convective envelope raise along isorotational contours and reach the surface at different latitudes .",
    "one can notice from fig 1 that the internal rotational profile ( continuous curve ) , as inferred from helioseismology ( antia , basu and chitre 1998 ) , has two rotational gradients , _ viz .",
    ", _ a positive rotational gradient from base of the convective envelope to @xmath19 and a negative rotational gradient from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .    from the magnetic induction equation ,",
    "it is proposed in this study that growth and decay of either sunspots area or magnetic flux is due to interplay of both convective source term ( that in turn depends mainly upon fluctuations in the positive rotational gradient and convection ) and sink term ( that in turn depends upon fluctuations in negative rotational gradient , magnetic eddy diffusivity and radiation effects near the surface ) .",
    "that means sunspots that are formed in the region of positive rotational gradient , while raising toward the surface , accumulate magnetic flux from the ambient magnetic turbulent medium and reduction of magnetic flux in the region of negative rotational gradient .",
    "the net magnetic flux of the sunspot that is formed in the region of positive rotational gradient in the convective envelope while raising it s anchoring feet and reaching toward @xmath19 , should increase and , magnetic flux should decrease as flux tubes anchoring feet lifts from @xmath19 to @xmath20 . on the other hand , the sunspots that are formed in the region of negative rotational gradient while raising toward the surface mainly experience decay phase only .",
    "these reasonable ideas will be clear in the following section . in order to understand and test these ideas on growth and decay phases of the sunspots ,",
    "magnetic induction equation is solved by considering the source and the sink terms separately . in section 2 ,",
    "formulation of the equations are presented . with reasonable approximations ,",
    "analytical solution of magnetic induction equation for the growth of area is presented in section 3 and solution for decay part is presented in section 4 . in section 5 , both the analytical solutions are fitted with observed sunspots growth and decay phases of the sunspots and conclusions from these results are presented .",
    "it is assumed that , in the convective envelope , fluid is incompressible .",
    "we also assume that the magnetic eddy diffusivity @xmath13 with value represented by the appropriate average .",
    "magnetic field @xmath21 and the velocity field @xmath22 vectors are expressed as @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the unit vectors along heliographic latitude @xmath2 and longitude @xmath27 of the sun ; @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are scalar functions . @xmath28 and @xmath29 are scalar functions that represent poloidal and toroidal parts of the the magnetic field structures and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are scalar functions that represent poloidal ( meridional ) and toroidal ( angular velocity ) parts of the velocity field structures .",
    "equation of continuity is @xmath32 as the life spans ( @xmath18 weeks to months ) of sunspots are very much larger than the time scales ( @xmath18 minutes ) of ambient density perturbations in the convective envelope , we have @xmath33 and the resulting equation is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the density . similarly as magnetic diffusivity is assumed to be constant , magnetic induction equation is @xmath36 this magnetic induction equation determines growth and decay of the sunspot .",
    "the first term on right hand side ( rhs ) is the source term that enhances the magnetic flux of the sunspot and second term on rhs is the sink term that attempts to destroy the generated magnetic flux . as magnetic induction equation in turn depends upon velocity and diffusivity @xmath13 , these two source and sink terms are important and dictate the growth and decay of the sunspots .",
    "we solve the induction equation by considering the source and sink terms separately for the following reasons . in case of region of positive rotational gradient from base of convective envelope to @xmath37 , rate of increase of magnetic flux that mainly depends upon fluctuations of increase in rotational gradient",
    "is dominant compared to magnetic diffusivity . as for region of negative rotational gradient from @xmath37 to @xmath38 , fluctuations in decreasing rotational gradient , increasing magnetic diffusivity ( as magnetic diffusivity @xmath39 , where @xmath29 is ambient temperature ) and dominant radiational effects near the surface remove and destroy the magnetic flux .",
    "after substituting equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in equation ( 5 ) and also by satisfying the continuity equation ( 4 ) , by considering a source ( first ) term of the toroidal component of the induction equation in spherical coordinates is    @xmath40    where @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are radial , latitudinal and longitudinal variables in spherical coordinates . the last term in rhs of the above equation can be simplified further as follows @xmath44 where @xmath31 is the angular velocity , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are changes in longitudinal displacement from time @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively .",
    "hence we have following equations @xmath49",

    "this condition also implies that magnitudes of products of the fluctuating components are nearly zero .",
    "further it is assumed that poloidal component of the magnetic field structure @xmath28 is constant and it s magnitude is very small compared to magnitude of toroidal magnetic field structure .",
    "this reasonable assumption is consistent with the observed strength of solar magnetic field structure that during 11 years period strength of poloidal field structure ( @xmath18 1 g ) is @xmath63 strength of toroidal magnetic field structure ( @xmath64 g ) .",
    "that means the fluctuating term @xmath65 is neglected . hence resulting time dependent part of toroidal component of global magnetic field structure for the alfven wave perturbations along the direction of rotation",
    "is given as follows @xmath66 derivative @xmath67 can be modified as follows @xmath68 where @xmath7 is steady part of meridional circulation .    on both sides of the equation ( 13 ) ,",

    "although momentum equation is necessary ( for the hydrostatic equilibrium of internal structure of the sun , as @xmath72 is proportional to fluctuating parts of advective terms , lorentzian force and variation in the second derivative of angular velocity ) , as fluctuating terms are assumed to be small ( although in principle not to be neglected ) , radial variation of last two terms in rhs is neglected .",
    "hence , with the initial conditions that at time @xmath73 , area @xmath74 ( initial area ) , solution yields the following relationship between increase of flux tube area ( while it raises in the positive rotational gradient ) with respect to time . @xmath75",
    "as for alfven wave perturbations that are opposite to the direction of angular velocity , solution for growth of the sunspot is @xmath76 hence , in the region of positive rotational gradient , simultaneous growth and decay of the alfven wave perturbations exist yielding net exponential growth of the sunspot .",
    "another interesting property of solution ( equation 16 ) is that exponent of the growth part depends upon magnitude of meridional velocity @xmath7 , @xmath77 and the depth of the foot point of the flux tube where it is anchored .",
    "it is not known how the meridional velocity varies with depth and it is assumed to be constant .",
    "thus as time progresses , due to buoyancy , anchored feet lifts from interior in the positive rotational gradient ( until it reaches maximum angular velocity at the depth @xmath78 ) with an exponential growth of area of the sunspot .    if one keeps the ratio @xmath79 constant at a particular depth ( say near the surface ) , exponent of solution for growth of area is directly proportional to @xmath77 .",
    "that means by the property of @xmath77 function , spots at the lower co - latitudes @xmath42 ( or higher heliographic latitudes ) grow very fast compared to the spots that grow at the lower co - latitudes ( or lower heliographic latitudes , i , e . , near the equator ) . this important property of sunspot s growth will be tested in the following sections .",
    "once sunspot s anchoring feet enters the negative rotational gradient , the picture will be different and it will be known from the next section that area of the sunspot decays exponentially and ultimately disappears on the surface .",

    "<S> from the previous study ( hiremath 2009b ; hiremath 2010 ) , on the genesis of solar cycle and activity phenomena , it is understood that sunspots are formed at different depths by superposition of alfven wave perturbations of a strong toroidal field structure in the convective envelope and after attaining a critical strength , due to buoyancy , raise toward the surface along the rotational isocontours that have positive ( 0.7 - 0.935 @xmath0 ) and negative ( 0.935 - 1.0 @xmath0 ) rotational gradients . </S>",
    "<S> owing to physical conditions in these two rotational gradients , from the equation of magnetic induction , sunspot s area growth and decay problem is solved separately . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that rate of growth of sunspot s area during its evolution at different depths is function of steady and fluctuating parts of lorentzian force of the ambient medium , fluctuations in meridional flow velocity , radial variation of rotational gradient and @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is co - latitude ) . while rate of decay of sunspot s area at different depths during its evolution mainly depends upon magnetic diffusivity , rotational gradient and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> gist of this study is that growth and decay of area of the sunspot mainly depends upon whether sunspot is originated in the region of either positive or negative rotational gradient .    on the surface , as fluctuating lorentz forces and meridional flow velocity during sunspots evolution are considerably negligible compared to steady parts , analytical solution for growth of sunspot area @xmath4 is @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is area of the sunspot during its initial appearance and @xmath7 is steady part of meridional flow velocity on the surface , @xmath2 is co - latitude and @xmath8 is a time variable ) . </S>",
    "<S> similarly analytical solution for decay of sunspot s area on the surface follows the relation @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the integrational constants , @xmath0 is radius of the sun , @xmath12 steady part of angular velocity and @xmath13 is the magnetic diffusivity ) . for different latitudes and life spans of the sunspots on the surface during their evolutionary history , both the analytically derived theoretical area growth and decay curves match reasonably well with the observed area growth and decay curves . </S>"
