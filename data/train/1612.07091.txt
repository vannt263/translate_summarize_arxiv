    "the concept of missing states in qcd is intimately related to the completeness of the hadronic spectrum .",
    "the issue was anticipated by hagedorn in the mid 60 s  @xcite when analyzing the mass - level density @xmath1 and _ predicting _ the bulk of states at higher masses , which later on were experimentally confirmed .",
    "this also implies that the states may be _ counted _ one by one ( and hence ordered ) by , say , the cumulative number of states function , @xmath2 with @xmath3 the total degeneracy and @xmath4 .",
    "updated analyses of the hagedorn hypothesis may be found in  @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath5 assumes integer values , and the best mass resolution is @xmath6 . for bound states ,",
    "where the spectrum is discrete , this is a well defined procedure . in the continuum , this can only be done by putting the system in a box with finite but sufficiently large volume which acts as an infrared cut - off @xmath7 .",
    "the ultraviolet cut - off is the maximum mass @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ eq.count ] ) .",
    "the commonly accepted reference for hadronic states is the particle data group ( pdg ) table  @xcite , a compilation reflecting a consensus in the particle physics community and which grades states * , * * , * * * , and * * * * , according to the growing confidence in their existence , respectively .",
    "global features of the hadronic spectrum may depend on whether we decide to promote or demote their significance , according to some theoretical prejudice .",
    "of course , we expect the pdg hadronic states to have a one - to - one correspondence with colour neutral eigenstates of the qcd hamiltonian ; indeed , ground and some excited states have been determined on the lattice  @xcite . for hadronic states with only light ( @xmath0 ) quarks the maximum mass , @xmath9 , recorded by pdg is around @xmath10 for mesons and baryons , hence currently @xmath11 .",
    "so far , the states listed by pdg echo the standard quark model classification for mesons ( @xmath12 ) and baryons ( @xmath13 ) . because of this feature , it will be pertinent to consider also the relativized quark model ( rqm ) for mesons  @xcite and baryons  @xcite , as first done for @xmath5 in  @xcite  ( fig .",
    "the remarkable coincidence @xmath14 up to @xmath9 for _ both _ mesons and baryons has been shown in ref .",
    "the so - called `` further states '' may or may not be confirmed or expected and have not been clearly regarded by the pdg as identified , although they could be exotic tetraquarks , @xmath15 , pentaquarks , @xmath16 , glueballs @xmath17 , @xmath18 or hybrids @xmath19  @xcite .    in this contribution",
    "we analyze thermodynamic measures ( various susceptibilities ) which are sensitive to missing states .",
    "the setup corresponds to heating up the vacuum without dissolving its constituent hadrons into quarks and gluons and testing quark - hadron duality at temperatures below @xmath20 .",
    "obviously , such a framework is inefficient for individual states , but becomes competitive if globally a relatively large number of states are missing . as reported in  @xcite",
    "the hagedorn conjectured behaviour of @xmath21 for @xmath22 may influence the results close to @xmath23 , at temperatures above @xmath24  mev . according to  @xcite",
    ", there is not much room for such states in the one - body observables , where they would spoil the agreement with the lattice data , unless suitable repulsion between states is simultaneously incorporated . here",
    "will make no attempt to complete the spectrum beyond @xmath9 .",
    "the use of thermodynamical arguments to characterize the existence of missing states is a rather old subject which goes back to the early beginnings of the kinetic theory of gases and the equipartition theorem . in its most general form",
    "it states that every degree of freedom contributes to the mean energy with @xmath25 .. therefore @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the total number of degrees of freedom .",
    "generally , @xmath28 and the molar specific heat is @xmath29 .",
    "a major obstacle at the time was pointed out by j. c. maxwell in 1860 in connection to the specific heat of the diatomic gas such as , e.g. , @xmath30 , where a priori the total number of degrees of freedom is @xmath31 .",
    "this would imply @xmath32 , whereas experimentally at room temperature one has @xmath33 .",
    "this is because the vibrational degrees of freedom are not active due to high excitation energy , and become visible only as the dissociation temperature of @xmath34  k is approached . likewise , as @xmath35 is decreased , the rotational degrees of freedom are also frozen and below @xmath36  k , @xmath37 , as for the monoatomic molecules .    in modern terms",
    "the `` freezing '' of degrees of freedom is related to the quantization of energy levels for the hamiltonian @xmath38 with energy eigenvalues above the temperature , @xmath39 , contributing negligibly to the partition function @xmath40 in qcd , the quantized energy levels are the masses of the existing hadronic states and , like in the maxwell argument , the states which are not activated when @xmath41 do not contribute .",
    "completeness of the listed pdg states  @xcite is a subtle issue . on the one hand",
    "they are mapped into the @xmath42 and @xmath13 quark model states . on the other hand ,",
    "most reported states are not stable particles but resonances produced as intermediate steps in a scattering process .    with a finite lifetime @xmath43 ,",
    "they are characterized by a mass distribution @xmath44 , with a central value @xmath45 and a width @xmath46 . from a rigorous point of view resonances",
    "are poles of the _ exact _ amplitude in the second riemann sheet in the complex @xmath47 plane at @xmath48 .",
    "for multichannel scattering with @xmath49 channels one has @xmath50 riemann sheets , depending on which cuts have been crossed ( see , e.g. , @xcite for discussions in the meson - baryon @xmath51 sectors ) . despite the rigor of these definitions ,",
    "complex energies are not directly measured .",
    "an analytic continuation of a phenomenological and approximate scattering amplitude , taking into account a process dependent background , is needed and the arbitrariness grows with the width of the resonance  @xcite ( see e.g. for the specific @xmath52 case  @xcite ) . on average ,",
    "most of the resonances listed by pdg  @xcite can be regarded as narrow , since one finds @xmath53 _ both _ for mesons and baryons  @xcite , a fact numerically consistent with the large @xmath54 theoretical expectation @xmath55  @xcite . in the hamiltonian picture ,",
    "resonances are identified as the so - called gamow states and are not normalizable in the usual hilbert space , as they are not conventional irreducible representations of the poincar group  @xcite .",
    "the completeness relation involves bound states and the continuum , which can be rewritten as a discrete sum of the gamow states and a remainder  @xcite .",
    "the meaning of completeness is fairly clear within a given hilbert space @xmath56 with specified degrees of freedom when only bound states are possible .",
    "for instance , if we restrict ourselves to the meson @xmath57 or baryon @xmath58 sectors , such as in rqm  @xcite , we can diagonalize the @xmath59 and @xmath13 hamiltonians with confining potentials in a given already complete basis , which is truncated but large enough that states with @xmath60 converge .",
    "thus we write @xmath61 within this framework , hadrons are stable , extended , and composite particles .",
    "this is explicitly illustrated by the virial relations in the massless quark limit  @xcite @xmath62 and @xmath63 , which shows that hadrons are larger the heavier they become .",
    "many of these states may decay by strong processes , such as @xmath64 or @xmath65 , where a coupling to the continuum is needed by incorporating the @xmath66 and @xmath67 fock state . as a result",
    ", the pole mass is shifted into the complex plane @xmath68 . the mass - shift",
    "@xmath69 depends parametrically on the coupling to the continuum @xmath69 so that in the large @xmath54 limit , @xmath70  @xcite .    on the lattice ,",
    "hadrons are constructed as interpolating fields in a finite - volume box .",
    "completeness proceeds along similar lines , with the important modification that resonances are characterized by volume - independent and real mass shifts .",
    "the connection to physical resonances in the complex energy plane requires also analytical extrapolation ( for a review see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "be it the pdg  @xcite , rqm  @xcite , or the lattice excited qcd  @xcite , the partition function can be constructed from the ( complete ) energy localized colour neutral eigenstates , eq .",
    "( [ eq : z ] ) .",
    "the lattice at finite temperatures , or the ultrarelativistic heavy ions collisions , generate global colour neutral configurations which along the crossover are expected to delocalize . most of the emerging physical quark - hadron duality picture has to do with the thermodynamical equivalence of different approaches .    according to the quantum virial expansion  @xcite one can compute the partition function from the knowledge of the @xmath71-matrix in the complete hilbert space , i.e. , involving all possible processes with any number of elementary particles in both the initial and final states , @xmath72 . in practice ,",
    "hadrons have been taken as the building blocks in this approach , which for obvious practical reasons has never been taken beyond the @xmath73 reactions , where the corresponding phase shifts are involved . in the case of narrow resonances",
    "one can replace the total contribution entering in terms of phase shifts by the resonance itself  @xcite , whereby the resonance can be assumed to be elementary and point - like  @xcite .",
    "the result conforms to the hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) as initially proposed by hagedorn  @xcite .",
    "this provides the formal basis for modern hrg calculations using the pdg compilation . as mentioned above , most states entering the hrg are resonances with a given width , @xmath74 . therefore we will also consider the effect of smearing the mass distribution according to the replacement @xmath75 for an observable @xmath76 .. we do not use this large @xmath54 motivated prescription here as we feel that it largely overestimates the uncertainties for _ all resonances _ in the @xmath77 world . ]",
    "however , the elementary constituents are both quarks and gluons .",
    "a different derivation proceeds along chiral quark - gluon models with a quantum and local polyakov loop  @xcite . is ignored , thus introducing an undesirable group coordinates dependence .",
    "in addition , in pnjl the polyakov loop in the adjoint representation is not quenched , contradicting lattice calculations . ]",
    "the action corresponds to creating , e.g. a quark at location @xmath78 and momentum @xmath79 in the medium @xmath80 where in the static gauge @xmath81 .",
    "consequently , the total action can be separated into different quark and gluon sectors according to the low temperature partonic expansion around the vacuum  @xcite @xmath82",
    "subsequent hadronization of @xmath59 and @xmath13 states uses the cluster properties of the polyakov loop correlator and group properties of the haar measure , as well as the quantum , composite and extended nature of hadronic states .",
    "one appealing feature of this `` microscopic '' derivation of the hrg is the counting of states according to the quark model for the lowest fock state components , but ambiguities arise when a given colour neutral multiquark state admits a separation into colour neutral irreducible subsystems  @xcite .",
    "we take this result as our justification to use rqm .. this roughly corresponds to take @xmath83 uncertainty in @xmath35 . ]",
    "the fact that we use thermodynamic quantities to make a quantitative comparison does not sidestep the problem of discriminating different spectra .",
    "the best example is provided by a direct comparison of hrg using either pdg or rqm  @xcite in terms of the trace anomaly , @xmath84 which are hardly indistinguishable within the lattice qcd uncertainties from the wb  @xcite and hotqcd  @xcite collaborations ( see fig.1 of ref .",
    "as already mentioned the states with @xmath85 with an exponential hagedorn distribution are relevant below @xmath23  @xcite only at @xmath86  mev , and their contribution may be overcome with repulsive effects .",
    "actually , the volume effects are expected to play a significant role ; the excluded volume exceeds the total volume around @xmath87 ( see fig .  9 of ref .",
    "the idea of thermal shifts is to study the change of thermodynamic quantities under the presence of local external sources .",
    "this looks very much like adding an impurity to a macroscopic system or adding a grain of salt to a bunch of snow . by looking a these thermal shift",
    "we may also assess a possible existence of missing states .",
    "an interesting hadronic example is provided by the free energy shift caused by a heavy quark placed in a hot medium with vacuum quantum numbers , which corresponds to a ratio of partition functions which can be identified with the polyakov loop expectation value . this free energy shift is ambiguous and hence it is better to deal with the corresponding entropy shift and the specific heat , which are directly measurable quantities . a hadronic representation of polyakov loop and its entropy has been analyzed  @xcite .",
    "the implications of thermal shifts due to a heavy source or a heavy @xmath88 pair located at a fixed distance @xmath89 at the hadronic level has recently been considered in  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : entropy - models ] from ref .",
    "@xcite makes a good case for different categories of missing charm or bottom states . on the one hand",
    "the pdg is clearly insufficient to describe the entropy shift .",
    "so , we clearly miss higher mass states . guided by the thermodynamic equivalence of pdg and rqm in the @xmath0 sector  @xcite",
    ", we may complete the pdg spectrum using the rqm in the c- or b- sectors .",
    "as we see there is a big improvement and , moreover , the change when going from c to b is sufficiently small .",
    "nonetheless , we have still missing states , a feature that is not mended when extending the spectrum a la hagedorn .",
    "when a bag model with the heavy source located at the center is considered for singly heavy hadrons @xmath90 , @xmath91 and a hybrid @xmath92 the tum lattice data are well reproduced .",
    "the connection between fluctuations and the abundance of hadronic resonances was pointed out by jeon and koch  @xcite , who later  @xcite proposed it as a signal for the quark - gluon plasma formation from the partition function ( for pedagogical reviews see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "implications for heavy ion collisions are reviewed in  @xcite . in  @xcite ,",
    "the event - by - event statistical analysis of ultrarelativistic heavy ions - collisions was compared to the hrg with a given chemical potential .",
    "of course , any mismatch in this kind of analyses suggests missing resonances .",
    "here we are concerned with the simplest vacuum zero density case .",
    "actually , some authors have understood the significance of fluctuations as a possible hint of missing states  @xcite .",
    "fluctuations of conserved charges , i.e. fulfilling @xmath93=0 $ ] , are a way of selecting given quantum numbers  @xcite and become particularly simple in terms of the grand - canonical partition function which is given by @xmath94 with @xmath95 the corresponding potential .",
    "one then gets @xmath96 where @xmath97 . in the @xmath0 sector",
    "the only conserved charges are the electric charge @xmath98 , the baryon charge @xmath99 and the strangeness @xmath71 , which is equivalent to the number of @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath47 quarks .",
    "we consider the hot vacuum ( no chemical potential ) @xmath102 .    for @xmath103 ,",
    "fluctuations have been computed on the lattice by the wb  @xcite and hotqcd  @xcite collaborations with the high temperature asymptotic limits @xmath104 where @xmath105 .",
    "higher order cumulants , such as skewness and kurtosis originally analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite , have also recently been computed more accurately  @xcite , but we do not discuss them here .    in the hadron resonance model ,",
    "the charges are carried by various species of hadrons , @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the number of hadrons of type @xmath108 , hence @xmath109 the average number of hadrons is @xmath110 where @xmath111 , @xmath112 is the degeneracy and @xmath113 for bosons / fermions respectively . in practice",
    "the boltzmann approximation ( i.e. , just keeping @xmath114 ) is sufficient . regarding the fluctuations , since the different species are uncorrelated @xmath115 , for the occupation numbers . since @xmath116 , @xmath117     +    our results for the susceptibilities",
    "are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : hrg - pdg ] where we show the hotqcd lattice data  @xcite ( the earlier wb data  @xcite are compatible with them so they are not included in the figure to avoid cluttering . ) .",
    "we compare with the standard hrg model , denoted as pdg , the hrg including a gaussian width profile , which we denote as pdg ( @xmath74 ) , and the rqm .",
    "our scheme here is to include _ all _ states from pdg , which as mentioned are mapped into the standard quark model classification of mesons as @xmath59 and baryons as @xmath13 as the only hadronic states .",
    "this choice of states provides a visible effect in the @xmath118 correlator bringing it closer to the lattice data as compared to  @xcite where only @xmath119 pdg states are considered .",
    "the inclusion of width effects is also generally quite sizeable and can not be ignored , as it has routinely been done in many hrg comparisons in the past ( see however @xcite ) . nevertheless , there are other ways to include the width profile which will somehow blur the pdg(@xmath74 ) result , and a more systematic study , perhaps including also volume effects , would be most helpful .    the remarkable good agreement of the trace anomaly found between pdg and rqm  @xcite or the pdg(@xmath74 )  @xcite compared with lattice qcd results from wb  @xcite and hotqcd  @xcite collaborations gets a bit spoiled in terms of the considered fluctuations , where these spectra may feature missing or exceeding states .",
    "for instance , a look at the @xmath120 correlation in fig .",
    "[ fig : hrg - pdg ] suggests that the rqm has too many baryonic states but not too many charged states .",
    "therefore , the thermodynamic equivalence will depend on the quantum numbers , enhancing the relevance of a fluctuation analysis , as done here , in the discussion of quark - hadron duality .",
    "in the present contribution we have revised the thermodynamical equivalence between the pdg , rqm , and lattice qcd for temperatures below the hadron - gas  quark - gluon - plasma crossover for the case of an entropy shift due to a heavy quark and fluctuations via baryon , charge and strangeness susceptibilities as diagnostic tools for missing states .",
    "the analysis of the entropy shift due to a heavy quark suggests that there are conventional ( high mass ) missing states in single charm , or bottom hadrons ( @xmath90 and @xmath121 ) and it looks likely that a large number of hybrids ( @xmath92 ) is also missing .    in the pure light @xmath0 sector ,",
    "our perception on the missing states may change when finite width effects are placed into the calculation .",
    "this effectively corresponds to redistribute the mass spectrum weighted with an asymmetric boltzmann factor . from that point of view the missing states effect",
    "could also be regarded as a missing mass effect . at this level",
    "the highest temperature of agreement for the trace anomaly seems to be @xmath122 between either the hrg based on pdg , pdg ( @xmath74 ) or rqm spectra and current qcd finite temperature calculations .",
    "however , the separate analysis in terms of @xmath123 fluctuations reveals a less obvious pattern regarding the verification of quark - hadron duality . while the hrg has arbitrated the lattice qcd discrepancies for the trace anomaly in the past , in the case of fluctuations we are now confronted with the opposite situation .",
    "lattice data agree but are not universally reproduced by any of the three hrg realizations considered here .",
    "this may offer a unique opportunity to refine these models including other effects and which deserves further studies .",
