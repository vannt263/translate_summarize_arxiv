    "recently , the cdf collaboration has reported @xcite some evidence for the production of heavy quarks with mass of order 174 gev at the tevatron .",
    "the most likely explanation is , of course , the standard model ( sm ) top quark .",
    "however , at present , in principle it is still possible @xcite that the signal is due to some other heavy quark , whereas the actual top quark is hiding below @xmath5 .",
    "this is because the top quark semileptonic branching ratio ( br ) has not yet been measured .",
    "if , for some reason , @xmath20 , the sm expected value , the top quark may have evaded detection .",
    "this can arise basically only through scalar induced interactions @xcite .",
    "one such scenario was proposed @xcite earlier by mukhopadhyaya and nandi ( mn ) . following a suggestion @xcite by barbieri and hall ( bh ) ,",
    "mn considered the existence of @xmath21 singlet charge @xmath22 quark @xmath6 alongside sm fermions .",
    "since gim is broken , the mixing of @xmath6 with up - type quarks induce tree level flavor changing neutral couplings of the sm higgs boson .",
    "if @xmath23 , @xmath4 transitions may trigger the aforementioned mechanism of suppressing @xmath24 . in a subsequent paper , facing criticisms of  naturalness \" @xcite ( @xmath25 suppressions of heavy @xmath6 effects ) , mn retracted , and considered @xmath4 dominance to be not very likely @xcite . in this letter we study the precise conditions that @xmath4 dominance can be realised .",
    "we find that this requires @xmath6 to be strongly mixed with _ both _ charm and top , which can occur even with a small @xmath7 eigenvalue .",
    "however , we find that although @xmath4 can be dominant , it is unlikely to be overwhelmingly dominant",
    ". thus , @xmath26 should occur at reduced but still substantial fraction .",
    "this offers hope that , even if @xmath27 , the top quark can be uncovered at the tevatron by a renewed study with existing data",
    ".    the heavy quark @xmath6 can decay both via @xmath28 and @xmath11 bosons @xcite , hence it could be the heavy quark observed by cdf .",
    "although one could not explain the larger than expected cross section for 174 gev quarks , one could plausibly account for the @xmath12-tagged @xmath29 4 jets events @xcite .",
    "eventually , events with @xmath30 2 jets should start to emerge with increased luminosity @xcite .",
    "another point of great phenomenological interest is @xmath15 decays , first stressed in this context by bh @xcite",
    ". these occur at tree level again because of gim violation .",
    "although widely known , the possibility apparently has not been studied with actual lep data because of the standard expectation of a very heavy top .",
    "we estimate @xcite that @xmath15 could occur at the @xmath16 level , but _ with @xmath31 of order a few percent_. this results in a signal branching ratio of @xmath32 at the few @xmath33 level , and each lep experiment could have a few tens of events at present .",
    "the background level can probably be managed , and lep experiments are strongly urged to conduct such a search .",
    "besides the standard @xmath34-type quarks @xmath35 , @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) , we add a left - right singlet charge @xmath2 quark @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "the left - handed singlet field @xmath38 can pair up with the four right - handed fields to form gauge invariant singlet masses , which we denote as @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively .",
    "the right - handed singlet field @xmath39 introduces three extra yukawa couplings , resulting in off - diagonal masses which we denote as @xmath42 .",
    "thus , the @xmath34-type quark mass matrix is @xmath43,\\ ] ] where @xmath44,\\;\\;\\ ; \\mbox{\\boldmath $ s$ } = \\left [ \\begin{array}{rr }               0   & 0 \\cr               m^\\prime & m             \\end{array } \\right],\\ ] ] are yukawa and singlet masses .",
    "is diagonalised by a biunitary transform , @xmath45 where , departing from the notation of mn @xcite , @xmath46,\\ ] ] and @xmath47 is a @xmath48 matrix .",
    "the yukawa matrix is not simultaneously diagonalised , @xmath49 and the off - diagonal term controls fcnc @xmath50 and @xmath51 couplings . the apparent freedom due to the presence of @xmath52 rotation matrix on right - handed fields led mn originally to conclude that @xmath53 coupling could easily be rather large .",
    "however , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mdiag ] ) , simple algebra gives @xmath54,\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the diagonal @xmath48 mass matrix ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : mdiag ] ) ) .",
    "we see that no reference to @xmath52 is left , and the off - diagonal couplings depend only on mass eigenvalues and @xmath6-related mixing elements of @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the relevant flavor changing higgs couplings are @xcite ( @xmath57 ) @xmath58 the fcnc @xmath11 couplings are @xcite @xmath59 which is simply related to the higgs couplings . the charged current becomes @xmath60 where @xmath61 the @xmath48 km matrix @xmath62 is no longer unitary .",
    "both @xmath62 and @xmath63 depend on the @xmath48 left - handed down quark rotation matrix @xmath64 .",
    "we wish to explore the range of parameter space where @xmath65 coupling could be sizable . to this end",
    "we make a special choice of basis to focus on the problem .",
    "first , we choose @xmath66 fields such that @xmath67 in .",
    "second , we choose @xmath35 , @xmath68 , such that the matrix @xmath69 is diagonal , hence the km matrix largely comes from the down - type quark sector ( we have checked that it is not possible to generate the observed km matrix structure just by introducing @xmath34-type singlet quarks ) .",
    "only the charged current is affected by the @xmath70-type quark sector , the fcnc higgs and @xmath11 couplings depend only on @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the @xmath34-type quark mass matrix is now in the form @xmath73 .",
    "\\label{eq : ansatz}\\ ] ] the relevant freedom introduced by the singlet quark @xmath6 is parametrized as 3 new off - diagonal yukawa terms , plus the diagonal , gauge invariant dirac mass @xmath41 .",
    "the parameters @xmath71 , @xmath74 and @xmath72 can be found by diagonalizing @xmath75 . without loss of generality , we set @xmath76 so @xmath34 quark decouples from our discussion . to illustrate the correlation between @xmath77 and @xmath78 , we set @xmath79 and plot , in fig .",
    "1 , the mass eigenvalues @xmath80 , @xmath81 vs. @xmath82 for different @xmath83 values .",
    "level repulsion is evident : @xmath84 and @xmath85 for @xmath86 , @xmath87 . for larger @xmath88 values",
    ", we adopt the convention that , if @xmath89 , the heavier state is defined as the top quark . thus , fig .",
    "1 depicts both the mass eigenvalues and the label for @xmath1 and @xmath6 .",
    "we are more interested in the effect of @xmath90 . with finite @xmath90 , but negligible @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , the heavy mass eigenvalues are @xmath94 where @xmath95 . for sake of discussion , we consider the case where @xmath96 ( top lighter ) .",
    "note that in fig . 1 when @xmath97 is not too large , the top mass eigenvalue is close to the diagonal term @xmath86 .",
    "this is a generic feature .",
    "when other @xmath98 s can be ignored and @xmath99 is not too big , the mass eigenvalue and mixing are roughly @xmath100 these relations become affected only when there are _ two _ @xmath101 values that are sizable , which follows largely as a consequence of unitarity of the @xmath102 matrix @xmath56 . in fig .",
    "2 we plot @xmath103 , @xmath104 as a function of @xmath97 for @xmath105 and @xmath106 @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 .",
    "note the remarkable feature that @xmath104 is almost independent of @xmath103 , but @xmath103 is suppressed by large @xmath104 through unitarity . the physical reason for this can be traced back to the fact that @xmath110 is very small compared to 1 , and that @xmath7 is small .",
    "thus , the eigenvalue @xmath111 could be made small by choosing a small value for @xmath93 , but this does not forbid @xmath112 from being sizable .",
    "this is precisely _",
    "the  hierarchy principle \" @xcite advocated in ref . @xcite . however , given that @xmath86 , @xmath113 are large , other than being a prejudice , there is really no reason why @xmath90 can not be large , since it is an independent parameter .",
    "of course , if @xmath114 , then the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite would hold .",
    "inspection of eq . ( [ eq : hu ] ) suggests that @xmath115 transitions are suppressed by @xmath116 @xcite , but @xmath117 transitions have the effective coupling @xmath118 . since @xmath119 is not small , so long that @xmath120 is not too suppressed , the @xmath4 mode has good probability to be dominant over @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the necessary condition is therefore that both @xmath104 and @xmath103 are sizable and neither are suppressed .",
    "hence , _ q , t and c all become rather arbitarily mixed _ although the charm mass is fixed by @xmath93 .",
    "such an unusual situation is bound to have unusual consequences beyond @xmath121 being sizable .    to illustrate the possibility of @xmath4 dominance , _ and _ at same time account for cdf s apparent observation of a heavy quark of mass 174 gev , we demand that the heavier quark ( whether dominantly doublet or singlet ) mass to be pinned to the cdf value .",
    "we then choose @xmath122 , @xmath123 gev , vary @xmath86 ( to get @xmath124 , @xmath125 etc . ) and plot , in fig .",
    "3 , @xmath126 vs. @xmath124 ( the physical mass ) up to 90 gev , for @xmath127 5075 gev .",
    "we allow for @xmath128 below the present lep bound in case there are more than one higgs doublet @xcite . in producing fig .",
    "3 , we compute the @xmath4 and @xmath129 decay width using the couplings of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hu ] ) and ( [ eq : wu ] ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath64 amounts to a  small \" rotation close to the  standard \" km matrix , ignoring all phases .",
    "we have also ignored @xmath130 decay as this is a three body process subdominant compared to @xmath26 .",
    "it is clear that , if the higgs boson mass is sufficiently light , @xmath4 can be dominant .",
    "however , the combined demand of @xmath131 174 gev , and @xmath9 , dictates that the @xmath4 mode can not be overwhelmingly dominant .",
    "thus , although suppressed , @xmath132 should not be vanishingly small . for larger @xmath128 ,",
    "@xmath4 dominance quickly fades , and the possibility is ruled out by cdf since @xmath26 is not drastically suppressed . in the following , we shall assume that one works in the domain where @xmath24 for the  top \" ( it could be the dominantly singlet quark , since we do not know the scale for @xmath41 ) is suppressed by @xmath133 or more .",
    "that is , @xmath134 .",
    "3 corresponds to @xmath135 @xmath136 , with @xmath137 gev .",
    "the corresponding @xmath138 branching ratios are 0.51 , 0.24 , 0.04 , 0.1 , 0.02 , 0.09 , respectively .",
    "note that , as a consequence of large @xmath104 , @xmath139 decay has a sizable rate ! the modes @xmath140 and @xmath141 are suppressed by phase space , while @xmath142 and @xmath143 are suppressed by an extra power of @xmath144 .",
    "thus , @xmath28 induced decays are still dominant , but the @xmath12 content in final state is diluted slightly by the @xmath14 mode .",
    "although one can not account for the large production cross section for the heavy quark ( _ one could always add another singlet @xmath34-type quark for this purpose _ ) , other features reported by cdf can be accounted for @xcite , in particular , the appearance of @xmath12-tagged @xmath145 4 jet events .",
    "the @xmath11 boson comes from @xmath146 , @xmath141 , while a @xmath12-tag could come from @xmath147 , or from @xmath26 or @xmath148 , etc .",
    ", in subsequent decays . this could be at @xmath149 of the @xmath150 cross section , hence consistent to what is observed .",
    "on the other hand , single-@xmath28 with @xmath12-tag is slightly depressed ( @xmath151 ) compared to the standard top .",
    "we therefore conclude that the heavy quark observed by cdf may well be a doublet - singlet mixed state @xmath6 .",
    "the scenario offers many signatures and can be checked experimentally .",
    "the light top with not too suppressed @xmath24 can perhaps be probed with existing tevatron data @xcite .",
    "the scenario has a consequence that may be studied at lep . as first pointed out by barbieri and hall @xcite",
    ", @xmath15 can be quite sizable with existence of charge 2/3 singlet quarks.using eq .",
    "( [ eq : zu ] ) and @xmath104 , @xmath103 values for the example above , we estimate that @xmath152 is of order a few @xmath153 , which is consistent with ref . @xcite . other phenomenological constraints are not particularly stringent , and can be found in ref .",
    "for example , @xmath154@xmath155 mixing constraint can be satisfied with small @xmath92 .",
    "since @xmath156 does not vanish , we estimate that the potentially observable signal of @xmath157 2 jet ( where the jets contain @xmath12 and @xmath0 ) could have a branching ratio of order a few @xmath33 . since the lepton and neutrino should be well isolated with sizable ( @xmath158 gev ) @xmath18 or missing energy ( they are _ bona fide _ virtual @xmath28 decay events ! ) , and that @xmath159 , @xmath160 and one jet should pair up to be the top mass , there should be sufficient handles for the suppression of background .",
    "the latter presumably comes from events with @xmath161 plus gluon bremsstrahlung .",
