    "the compact galaxies are ( by definition , as they are defined to be 1-@xmath61 below the local relation ) 17% of the global population of etgs , and the ultra  compact formally disappear almost completely by @xmath11 .",
    "however , it has been argued that the sdss database may be biased against very compact galaxies ( scranton  et  al .",
    "2002 ; shih  &  stockton  2011 ; valentinuzzi  et  al .",
    "2010a ; carollo  et  al .",
    "we note that our estimate of the number density of compact etgs at @xmath11 is @xmath35 times higher than the lower limit determined by valentinuzzi  et  al .",
    "( 2010a ) , thus formally in agreement , and that our new point at @xmath100 seems to confirm the mild decrease . from @xmath2",
    "to @xmath11 the number density of compact etgs decreases by a factor of around 2 .",
    "the picture is less clear for the ultra - compact etgs : the sdss imaging does not offer enough spatial resolution to identify ultra - compact etgs , and thus we indicate the number density of ultra - compact etgs as a lower limit in figure  5 .",
    "the new point at @xmath100 seems to support the fast decrease of the the number density of ultra - compact etgs at @xmath10 , but the large error bar does not help to unambiguously fix the issue . in the end , the evolution seems to be strongly size  dependent , with a faster decrease for smaller etgs , even though we can not draw any strong conclusion due to the @xmath11 uncertainties .",
    "this differential evolution is in quite good agreement with recent results by carollo  et  al .",
    "( 2013 ) , who found a even milder decrease of the number density of etgs with sizes smaller than 2 kpc ( that is slightly larger than our `` compactness '' definition : according to our definition , etgs of @xmath101 are compact if their size is smaller than 1 kpc ) .",
    "in this paper we analyzed a sample of passive ( ssfr@xmath102 ) and massive ( @xmath103 ) etgs at @xmath6 .",
    "the deep h ",
    "band imaging ensures that the sample is complete down to @xmath19 , about an order of magnitude below @xmath20 ( ilbert  et  al .",
    "2010 ) and allows us to study the morphology of our galaxies in the optical rest ",
    "frame up to @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , the dense multiwavelength coverage ensures robust redshift measurements ( for the objects without a spectroscopic redshift ) , accurate mass and star formation activity determinations .",
    "the herschel and spitzer ancillary data allowed us to reinforce the passivity selection based on the sed fitting procedure .",
    "the key finding of this paper are : 1 .",
    "the identification up to @xmath1 of passive and massive etgs , that dominate the red sequence ( well defined up to @xmath18 , less clear at @xmath104 , see figure  [ fig : color_mass ] ) ; 2 . the accurate determination , with the evolution of average size for etgs at @xmath105 , reported in figure  [ size_redshift ] ; 3 .",
    "the robust determination of the differential evolution of the spatial abundance of massive , i.e. stellar mass @xmath106 m@xmath107 , passive galaxies as a function of redshift and as a function of the their size , a proxy of their average projected central stellar density , shown in figure  [ fig5 ] .    at high redshift ,",
    "i.e. @xmath1 , the size distribution of etgs is heavily tilted toward small sizes , and massive and passive galaxies are predominantly high  stellar density systems .",
    "this implies that the mechanism through which these galaxies accrete their mass and eventually become passive at those early epochs leaves a remnant that is very compact ( cimatti  et  al .",
    "many different mechanisms leading to the formation of compact remnants have been proposed in literature : dekel  et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) argued that disk instabilities lead to the formation of compact remnants ; hopkins  et  al .",
    "( 2008 ) , wuyts  et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) and bournaud  et  al .",
    "( 2011 ) showed that gas ",
    "rich mergers can form compact galaxies ; johansson ,  naab ,  &  ostriker  ( 2012 ) proposed that compact galaxies can formed by in situ star formation driven by cold flows .    by @xmath108 the abundance of small",
    "etgs reaches its peak , followed by a decline , apparently faster for the ultra ",
    "compact than for the compact ones ( see section  5 and discussion of the uncertainties for @xmath109 ) .",
    "apparently , whatever set of mechanisms was producing ultra  compact passive galaxies at @xmath110 is not working anymore at later epochs .",
    "moreover , the size distribution of the new etgs that become passive between @xmath2 and @xmath11 is gradually moving towards larger sizes , implying that the mechanism through which star formation is quenched in these massive etgs acts in such a way as to leave larger quenched remnants as ( cosmic ) time goes by , a tendency which accelerates at @xmath9 . this may be a natural consequence of the _ inside - out _ growth of the disks ( a widely entertained notion , samland  &  gerhard  2003 ; brook  et  al .",
    "2006 ; muoz  mateos  et  al .",
    "2011 ) , with such disks being the likely precursors to passive etgs .",
    "so , bigger disks would leave bigger etg _ remnants_.    in the @xmath10 epoch",
    "the average size of the etgs steadily increases ( see figure  4 ) .",
    "this evolution might be due to two different mechanisms ( or a mix of the two ) : on one hand , the individual etgs increase in size , by minor merging or accretion ; on the other hand new already large etgs , that never passed through the compact or ultra  compact phase , appear . in this respect ,",
    "the evolution of the number densities of etgs of different sizes , constrained in figure 5 , can help to weigh the relative importance of two mechanisms .",
    "in particular , even assuming that all the disappearing compact and ultra  compact etgs are transformed in etgs of normal size and density , in a cascade of merging and interactions to form normal ",
    "sized galaxies ( e.g. huang et al . 2012 ) , figure  5 shows that they are not numerous enough to support the increase of the total number of normal etgs observed over the same time interval .",
    "in fact , between @xmath2 and @xmath11 the number density all etgs increases by about @xmath111 , while the number density of compact etgs that disappear is only @xmath112 .",
    "this implies that the observed rate at which compact galaxies disappear can not sustain the observed increase of the number of normal etgs ; thus the growth of the individual etgs is not the dominant mechanism causing the average size of etgs to increase ( fig .",
    "[ size_redshift ] ) , in agreement with carollo  et  al .",
    "( 2013 ) .",
    "at the same time , the decrease of the number density of compact and ultra  compact etgs between @xmath2 and @xmath11 indicates that a fraction of these galaxies either become active , because of a sudden refurbishment of fresh gas , or more likely they grow in size , via minor merging or smooth accretion , becoming normal - sized etgs .    before concluding , we also wish to comment on the cosmic rise and fall of the ultra ",
    "compact passive galaxies that this paper has documented . the extreme compactness and large stellar mass of these galaxies argue against hierarchical merging of stellar systems as the primary mechanism for the assembly of their stellar mass ( giavalisco et al . in prep . ) . rather , it is likely that they emerged in their final state after the quenching of star  forming galaxies of the same size and density . in this case",
    "the rise and fall of ultra ",
    "compact etgs are the result of four different processes : 1 ) the rate at which ultra  compact star  forming galaxies form in this mass range ( roughly @xmath106 m@xmath107 ) ; 2 ) the rate at which they are destroyed before they quench , i.e. they are transformed from ultra ",
    "compact into galaxies of lower density by merging and interactions ; 3 ) the rate at which the ultra ",
    "compact star  forming galaxies shut down star formation and become passive ; 4 ) the rate at which the ultra  compact passive galaxies are transformed into galaxies of lower stellar density by merging and interactions",
    ". 1 ) and 2 ) , although not directly constrained by this work , define the `` reservoir '' of compact star  forming galaxies from which compact etgs can form ; the effects of mechanism 3 ) and 4 ) in shaping the number density evolution of compact etgs has been extensively discussed in this paper .",
    "interestingly , wuyts  et  al .",
    "( 2011 ) and barro  et  al .",
    "( 2013 ) identified a rich population of compact star forming galaxies at @xmath113 , whose number densities and physical properties are compatible with being the progenitors of the compact and ultra  compact etgs .",
    "the authors speculate that those compact star forming galaxies are formed from a gas  rich process ( merger or disk instabilities ) that at first induce a compact starburst and then feed an agn , which quenches the star formation turning these objects into compact etgs .",
    "they find that these compact star forming objects are very rare at @xmath114 , supporting our conjecture that after that epoch the mechanism through which etgs are formed produce a large remnant .",
    "however , the definition of etgs in barro  et  al .",
    "( 2013 ) , as well as the definition of which star forming galaxies can transform in etgs differ from ours .",
    "so , we looked for progenitors of our etgs in a companion paper , williams  et  al .",
    "( 2013 , in preparation ) : we have identified a sample of compact star forming galaxies which may be progenitors of our high ",
    "redshift passive sample , ( which represent some of the first etgs to appear in the universe ) .",
    "this sample have consistent sfrs and stellar masses with our etgs , and are evolutionarily consistent assuming physically motivated sfhs .",
    "this sample demonstrates that massive and active enough compact sf galaxies exist at @xmath115 to account for the number density of compact etgs presented here , assuming mass buildup by purely in ",
    "situ star ",
    "formation , further justifying the evolutionary link between compact sf and compact passive galaxies .",
    "* we find that at @xmath7 the passively evolving etgs are the reddest and most massive objects in the universe .",
    "this implies that an embryo of the hubble sequence , in the sense of a correlation between morphology , mass , color and star  formation activity of galaxies , is already in place at @xmath1 .",
    "we observe a scarcity of etgs with @xmath74 , with the majority of our etgs having @xmath75 . since we accurately set our mass completeness to @xmath19",
    ", we can conclude that that scarcity is not due to an observational bias .",
    "hence , at @xmath41 the mechanism producing etgs leaves a remnant that is preferentially very massive .",
    "this result reinforces previous claims for a `` downsizing '' pattern of the mass assembly of etgs .",
    "a possible interpretation is that at that early epoch the process that suddenly quenches the star ",
    "formation activity in some objects , transforming them into passively evolving etgs , is effective preferentially for objects with stellar mass above @xmath73 .",
    "this result is in qualitative agreement with peng  et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) , who highlighted the prominent role of mass quenching at high redshift . *",
    "we measure a significant evolution of the mass  size relation of etgs from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , with the average size of galaxies increasing by roughly a factor of @xmath32 over this redshift interval , corresponding to 3 gyrs of cosmic time .",
    "the evolution of the size of etgs is faster for galaxies with @xmath116 than for those with @xmath74 .",
    "about 90% ( 70% ) of the etgs at @xmath12 are compact ( ultra  compact ) .",
    "we find that the average size of etgs between @xmath1 and @xmath11 evolves with the redshift following a simple power law @xmath117 , with @xmath89 .",
    "if etgs with @xmath83 are fitted separately , we find a marginally steeper power @xmath118 for the most massive etgs ( @xmath91 ) , indicating a faster size evolution .",
    "* we witness the build up of the most massive etgs , with their number density increasing by 50 times between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we find that @xmath119% of etgs at @xmath12 are compact or ultra  compact , indicating that the event through which such first etgs accrete their mass leaves a remnant that is very compact .",
    "as the cosmic time goes by , new etgs tend to be larger and larger , with the `` normal '' sized etgs ( meaning those objects with sizes comparable to the local etgs of the same mass ) becoming the most common etgs at @xmath2 . at @xmath15",
    "the mechanisms creating new ultra ",
    "compact etgs prevail on those destroying them ( merging , smooth accretion ) , resulting in a net increase of their number density ; at @xmath9 the balance between such mechanisms inverts , with the processes decreasing the stellar density of ultra  compact galaxies finally prevailing .",
    "thus , the number density of compact passive etgs starts decreasing , although the measure of such decrease to @xmath120 remains quite uncertain . still , such decrease would not account for the increased number of  normal  size \" galaxies , even if all the compact , passive etgs at @xmath121 were to disappear by @xmath120 , therefore , the evolution of the average size of etgs at @xmath10 is mainly due to the appearance of newly quenched etgs that are born large , rather than to the size increase of individual galaxies .",
