    "belief merging consists in achieving a synthesis between pieces of information provided by different sources . although these sources are individually consistent , they may mutually conflict .",
    "the aim of merging is to provide a consistent set of information , making maximum use of the information provided by the sources while not favoring any of them .",
    "belief merging is an important issue in many fields of artificial intelligence ( ai ) @xcite and symbolic approaches to multi - source fusion gave rise to increasing interest within the ai community since the @xmath0s @xcite .",
    "one of today s major approaches is the problem of merging under ( integrity ) constraints in order to generalize both merging ( without constraints ) and revision ( of old information by a new piece of information ) . for the latter",
    "the constraints then play the role of the new piece of information",
    ". postulates characterizing the rational behavior of such merging operators , known as ic postulates , have been proposed by konieczny and pino prez  @xcite in the same spirit as the seminal agm @xcite postulates for revision .",
    "concrete merging operators have been proposed according to either semantic ( model - based ) or syntactic ( formula - based ) points of view in a classical logic setting @xcite .",
    "we focus here on the model - based approach of distance - based merging operators @xcite .",
    "these operators are parametrized by a distance which represents the closeness between interpretations and an aggregation function which captures the merging strategy and takes the origin of beliefs into account .",
    "belief change operations within the framework of fragments of classical logic constitute a vivid research branch .",
    "in particular , contraction @xcite and revision @xcite have been thoroughly analyzed in the literature .",
    "the study of belief change within language fragments is motivated by two central observations :    * in many applications , the language is restricted a priori .",
    "for instance , a rule - based formalization of expert s knowledge is much easier to handle for standard users . in case",
    "users want to revise or merge some sets of rules , they indeed expect that the outcome is still in the easy - to - read format they are used to . *",
    "many fragments of propositional logic allow for efficient reasoning methods .",
    "suppose an agent has to make a decision according to a group of experts beliefs .",
    "this should be done efficiently , therefore the expert s beliefs are stored as formul  known to be in a tractable class . for making a decision ,",
    "it is desired that the result of the change operation yields a set of formul   in the same fragment .",
    "hence , the agent still can use the dedicated solving method she is equipped with for this fragment .",
    "most of previous work has focused on the horn fragment except  @xcite that studied revision in any fragment of propositional logic .",
    "however , as far as we know , the problem of _ belief merging _ within _ fragments of propositional logic _ has been neglected so far .",
    "the main obstacle hereby is that for a language fragment @xmath1 , given @xmath2 belief bases @xmath3 and a constraint @xmath4 , there is no guarantee that the outcome of the merging , @xmath5 , remains in @xmath1 as well .",
    "let for example , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 be two sets of formul   and a formula expressed in the horn fragment . merging with typical distance - based operator proposed in @xcite does not remain in the horn language fragment since the result of merging is equivalent to @xmath9 , which is not equivalent to any horn formula ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we propose the concept of _ refinement _ to overcome these problems .",
    "refinements have been proposed for revision in @xcite and capture the intuition of adapting a given operator ( defined for full classical logic ) in order to become applicable within a fragment .",
    "the basic properties of a refinement aim to ( i ) guarantee the result of the change operation to be in the same fragment as the belief change scenario given and ( ii ) keep the behavior of the original operator unchanged in case it delivers a result which already fits in the fragment .",
    "refinements are interesting from different points of view .",
    "several fragments can be treated in a uniform way and a general characterization of refinements is provided for any fragment . defining and studying refinements of merging operators is not a straightforward extension of the revision case .",
    "it is more complex due to the nature of the merging operators . even if the constraints play the role of the new piece of information in revision , model - based merging deals with multi - sets of models .",
    "moreover applying this approach to different distance - based merging operators , each parameterized by a distance and an aggregation function , reveals that all the different parameters matter , thus showing a rich variety of behaviors for refined merging operators .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are the following :    * we propose to adapt known belief merging operators to make them applicable in fragments of propositional logic .",
    "we provide natural criteria , which refined operators should satisfy .",
    "we characterize refined operators in a constructive way . *",
    "this characterization allows us to study their properties in terms of the ic postulates @xcite . on one hand we prove that the basic postulates ( ic0ic3 ) are preserved for any refinement for any fragment . on the other hand",
    "we show that the situation is more complex for the remaining postulates .",
    "we provide detailed results for the horn and the krom fragment in terms of two kinds of distance - based merging operators and three approaches for refinements .",
