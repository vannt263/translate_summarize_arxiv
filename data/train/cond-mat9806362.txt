    "the defining property of a bose - einstein condensate is the macroscopic occupation of a single one - particle quantum state @xcite , a condition often referred to a off - diagonal long range order .",
    "even though bose - einstein condensation has been long known to exist in systems such as superfluid @xmath0he , the off - diagonal long range order itself was inaccessible to direct experimental verification .",
    "the achievement of bose - einstein condensation in dilute alkali gases @xcite , however , has revived interest in such direct experimental access .",
    "indeed , after a number of theoretical studies @xcite , it has become possible to demonstrate off - diagonal long range order as made manifest by an interference experiment @xcite and that finding has been confirmed by excellent agreement between experiment and theory @xcite .",

    "our main focus will be on first and second order coherence .    the preferred tools to study coherence are correlation functions .",

    "we assume a three - dimensional harmonic trapping potential and evaluate our results in the thermodynamic limit , i.e. , we will not account for effects due to a finite atom number .",
    "this restriction is justified by the large number of atoms @xmath1 in recent experiments .",

    "the first order correlation function can alternatively be expressed in terms of the wigner function @xmath8 which is a quantum mechanical analog of a classical single - particle phase space distribution .",

    "for this temperature , corrections to the term @xmath184 can be safely neglected , due to a larger thermal wavelength , i.e. , @xmath187 , and the long tail of the correlation function .",
    "we summarize in this section the coherence properties of trapped bose gases based on our results for the first and second order correlation functions .",
    "first order coherence describes the ability of atoms with an initial separation @xmath11 to form an interference pattern , when brought together . for an uncondensed gas , the visibility of such an interference pattern drops to zero on a length scale of @xmath11 measured by the thermal wavelength , which is roughly of the order of @xmath188 m in present experiments . in a bose condensed gas , however , the visibility decreases on the same length scale to a plateau given by the total fraction of condensed atoms .",
    "this off - diagonal long range order allowed the experimental observation of an interference pattern @xcite which extended over the whole cloud of condensate atoms . for spatial separations larger than the the size of the condensate , the visibility drops to zero as well , because long range order can not extend beyond the system size .",
    "second order coherence implies instead the absence of any density correlations other than the trivial autocorrelation pointed out in eq.([ncorr ] ) . in a dilute bose gas",
    ", we can identify two sources of density correlations which limit the achievable degree of second order coherence .",
    "an inevitable anticorrelation between atoms originates from their strong mutual repulsion .",
    "the length scale of this repulsion is given by the scattering length @xmath110 which is of the order of a few nanometers and therefore much smaller than any other relevant length scale .",
    "however , the relative wave function of two atoms increases as @xmath189 , which is to say very slowly .",
    "anticorrelation effects are therefore still visible on the length scale of the thermal wavelength , which is about 200 times larger ( at @xmath190 ) than the scattering length .",
    "the other limitation to second order coherence is due to the tendency of bosonic atoms to cluster together .",
    "the range of this effective bosonic attraction is again limited by the thermal wavelength . however , its maximal amount is a function of temperature too , since the condensate atoms do not exhibit such a clustering effect . because of the interplay between hard core repulsion and bosonic clustering , the maximum of the second order correlation function depends on both the temperature and the scattering length .",
    "it is nevertheless useful to characterize the local second order coherence by the maximum of the fictitious correlation function @xmath191 which does not account for hard core repulsion .",
    "we illustrate in fig .",
    "[ g2xxifig ] how this local measure of second order coherence , which is a function of the local condensate density , varies with the radial coordinate @xmath192 in a spherically symmetric system ( cf .",
    "analogously , the maximum @xmath193 of the volume integrated correlation function offers a certain global measure of the second order coherence of the system .",
    "fortunately , the quantity @xmath193 is experimentally accessible due to its relation to the total atomic interaction energy .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ g1kinetic ] ) the latter energy can be approximated by @xmath194 the overlap integral between the true atomic interaction potential and the relative wave function between the atoms is therefore approximately proportional to the maximum value of the otherwise fictitious volume integrated correlation function @xmath195 .    in a recent experiment @xcite the interaction energy and",
    "thereby @xmath193 were determined by measuring the release energy of the atoms after switching off the magnetic trap .",
    "this experiment provided some evidence for a large degree of second order coherence of a trapped bose - einstein condensate at zero temperature . at finite temperature , however , a determination of the interaction energy from the release energy would require that the initial kinetic energy of the uncondensed atoms be measured independently . in a similar experiment the third order analog of @xmath193 has been determined by measuring three - body scattering rates @xcite .",
    "the implications of these experiments for second and third order coherence has been discussed before @xcite .",
    "however , it was wrongly concluded that these experiments measure the true second order correlation function @xmath14 or its third order analog .",
    "the significant impact of the hard core repulsion on second and third order coherence has apparently not yet been fully appreciated .",
    "finally , we discuss the temperature dependence of @xmath193 in fig .",
    "[ g200ifig ] .",
    "the numerical plot shows a rapid but continuous decrease of @xmath193 as the temperature falls below the critical temperature .",
    "a comparison with a calculation in the hartree - fock limit shows that the existence of quasi - particle excitations has a small but noticeable effect on second order coherence .",
    "we contrast these results with the second order coherence of both a spatially homogeneous and a harmonically trapped ideal bose gas . in a spatially homogeneous medium",

    "[ g200ifig ] ) .",
    "in contrast the volume integrated second order correlation function of a harmonically trapped ideal bose gas @xmath197 experiences a sharp transition from the value two above the critical temperature to the value one below it .",
    "the reason for this discontinuous transition is that the peak density of a harmonically trapped noninteracting bose gas becomes infinite as the thermodynamic limit is reached while the peak density of the thermal cloud retains a finite value .",
    "of course , the presence of atomic interactions prevents any such unbounded growth of the condensate density for a real gas .",
    "nevertheless , the spatial inhomogeneity accelerates the transition to a second order coherent ensemble as the temperature is decreased .",
    "we have extended the concept of optical coherence , defined in terms of correlation functions , to dilute trapped bose gases . except for a small region around the surface of a bose - einstein condensate , these correlation functions can be calculated by using a local density approximation . even though the system behaves locally as if it were spatially homogeneous , the spatial dependence of the effective chemical potential adds some interesting new physical features .",
    "the influence of both the bose - einstein distribution of uncondensed atoms and of quasi - particle like excitations is strongly reduced when a volume average over the mean coordinate of the correlation functions is performed .",
    "nevertheless , consequences of quasi - particle excitations are still noticeable in the tails of the correlation functions .",
    "the density correlation is dominated by a tendency of bosonic atoms to cluster together and , on the other hand , the existence of a hard core repulsion between these atoms . the quantum statistical attraction and the effect of coulomb repulsion",
    "are found to be of comparable range for the conditions of most recent experiments .",
    "it is in this sense incorrect to neglect the hard core repulsion in the discussion of density correlations .    for the discussion of second order coherence , however , it is convenient to introduce a fictitious correlation function which does omit the effect of hard core repulsion .",
    "this correlation function is experimentally accessible due to its close relation to the atomic interaction energy . by introducing this fictitious correlation function",
    ", we are able to explain the results of recent experiments on second and third order coherence .",
    "finally , we have observed that a harmonically trapped gas achieves second order coherence much more rapidly as the temperature is lowered below the critical temperature than does its spatially homogeneous counterpart .",
