    "it is often the case in applications that viscous fluid flows in a thin layer at low reynolds number , which allows lubrication ( or long - scale , also long - wave ) theory to be used .",
    "@xcite the resulting decoupling between the long - scale and the ` thin ' direction greatly simplifies the mathematical solution of the flow .",
    "there is essentially only one equation to be solved , for the thickness of the fluid as a function of position .",
    "this equation arises from mass conservation appropriately averaged over the thin coordinate .",
    "the velocity is then deduced from the thickness .",
    "the mass - conservation equation to be solved involves only the long - scale coordinates .",
    "the third coordinate is ` slaved ' to the horizontal ones by the effect of viscosity . in that sense one",
    "usually thinks of thin - layer flows as ` two - dimensional , ' in the sense that vertical variations ( _ i.e. _ , in the thin direction ) exist but are subsumed in the theory and that the vertical velocity field is small .",
    "however , if one is interested in the transport properties of such flows , any amount of vertical variation is crucial .",
    "we will show here that even small variations can lead to chaotic behavior of particle trajectories , known as chaotic advection ,  @xcite greatly enhancing the transport properties of the flow .",
    "indeed , if the flow were truly two - dimensional and steady , chaotic transport would be impossible since two - dimensional autonomous dynamical systems can not exhibit chaos .",
    "@xcite    as far as we know , the transport properties of thin - layer flows have not been studied , beyond plotting streamlines in two - dimensional cases , probably because they were assumed too simple to be important .",
    "but understanding these properties could be important if , for instance , a compositionally - uniform coating is required in an industrial application .",
    "a related area that has received much attention lately is chaotic advection in microchannels .",
    "@xcite there periodic grooved patterns at the bottom of the channel cause swirl in the flow that leads to chaos . here",
    "we study a different regime where the bottom substrate has larger topographical variations , the is fluid thinner , and the sidewalls less important .",
    "we will show here that the shape of the curved substrate is crucial .",
    "though we investigate this for the case of steady gravity - driven flow with a free surface , the conclusions reached should qualitatively apply to different thin - flow situations such as those driven by surface tension gradients .",
    "constant surface tension is included in the derivation , but left out of most of the examples since it does not affect the qualitative results .",
    "there are several derivations of models of thin fluid flow over curved substrates in the literature .",
    "@xcite our approach follows that of roy  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite ( hereafter rrs ) , in that the vertical ( thin - direction ) coordinate is orthogonal to the long - scale coordinates , but differs in that the long - scale coordinates are not necessarily orthogonal to each other .",
    "this is because even though orthogonal coordinates can always be found ,  @xcite doing so for a general substrate ( other than planes , cylinders , and spheres ) requires solving differential equations numerically .",
    "working in generalized coordinates is not much more complicated if differential - geometric notation is used ,  @xcite and allows a simple parametrization of the substrate in terms of a height function .",
    "another motivation for re - deriving the model of rrs  @xcite is that we need to include correction terms to the mass - conservation equation and vertical velocity to ensure that the kinematic boundary condition at the free surface is satisfied exactly , up to numerical accuracy . in the rrs model",
    ", the kinematic boundary condition is satisfied to second order in the thickness .",
    "this is fine for most applications , but for particle advection it is catastrophic : in numerical simulations , individual particles will gleefully escape the top surface if they come anywhere near it , since even a second - order error is enough to give a small component of the velocity field normal to the surface . rather than remedy this in some ad - hoc manner ( by reflecting the particles back in , for instance ) , we instead include some judiciously - chosen second - order terms that guarantee that the kinematic boundary condition at the top surface is satisfied .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "sections  [ sec : coords][sec : dynamics ] comprise the derivation of the model equations . at each stage",
    ", we carefully record where the thinness of the layer comes in as an approximation .",
    "since we will be working with substrates of complicated shapes , the first part of of our paper ( section  [ sec : coords ] ) is devoted to establishing a convenient coordinate system for our problem .",
    "then we tackle mass conservation in those coordinates in section  [ sec : masscons ] .",
    "section  [ sec : dynamics ] introduces the dynamical equations of motion for stokes flow . in that section",
    "we also rescale the variables ( section  [ sec : small ] ) and solve for the velocity field ( section  [ sec : vel ] ) to first order in the thickness .",
    "this gives the mass flux vector , whose divergence must vanish for steady flow .",
    "we include second - order terms to the mass flux to impose the kinematic boundary condition at the free surface , which is essential for particle advection as discussed above .    in section",
    "[ sec : pdesolve ] we discuss solutions of the governing pde for the fluid thickness .",
    "the simplest type of solution involves substrates with a translational symmetry , for which the steady flow can be found analytically at leading order .",
    "however , solving for the flow at first order , or for substrates without such a symmetry , we must resort to numerical solutions .",
    "section  [ sec : advection ] is concerned with fluid particle advection and is the central results section of the paper .",
    "we examine the variety of particle trajectories by making poincar surfaces of section , for increasingly complicated substrates .",
    "as expected , the transport properties also become more complicated , exhibiting a range of behavior from trapped to chaotic trajectories .",
    "we offer some concluding remarks in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "in our problem , fluid motion occurs over a curved substrate of arbitrary shape .",
    "the direction normal to the substrate is special in that it defines the direction in which the fluid layer is assumed ` thin . '",
    "hence , it is convenient to locate a point  @xmath0 in the fluid as @xmath1 where  @xmath2 is the location of the substrate ,  @xmath3 is a unit vector normal to the substrate , and  @xmath4 is the perpendicular distance from  @xmath0 to the substrate .",
    "the coordinates  @xmath5 and  @xmath6 are substrate coordinates used to localize points on the substrate .",
    "for example , in section  [ sec : monge ] we will use the monge parametrization ,  @xmath7 , where  @xmath8 gives the height of the substrate .    the tangent vectors to the substrate are @xmath9 where  @xmath10 .",
    "the coordinate vectors associated with the coordinate system are found from  , @xmath11 where we assume the summation of repeated indices , and greek indices only take the value  @xmath12 or  @xmath13 .",
    "we have also defined the curvature tensor  @xmath14 from @xmath15 since changes in the unit vector  @xmath3 must be perpendicular to  @xmath3 , and  @xmath16 . note that the  @xmath17 are not necessarily orthogonal or normalised .",
    "we adopt the convention that quantities with a tilde are evaluated in the ` bulk ' ( away from the substrate ) , and thus depend on  @xmath4 , whilst those without the tilde are ` substrate ' quantities and do not depend on  @xmath4 .",
    "thus ,  @xmath18 . starting in section  [ sec : masscons ] , we will also denote quantities evaluated on the free surface at  @xmath19 by an overbar .    the three - dimensional metric tensor  @xmath20 has components @xmath21 where @xmath22 and we have written the symmetric tensor  @xmath23 in the usual manner of lowering indices with the metric tensor .",
    "@xcite the three - dimensional metric tensor is thus block - diagonal , and the  @xmath4 coordinate is unstretched compared to the cartesian coordinate system .",
    "it measures the true perpendicular distance from the substrate to a point in the fluid .",
    "note that it is important that indices be raised or lowered with the appropriate metric : @xmath24 for substrate quantities , @xmath20 or @xmath25 for bulk quantities .",
    "the tensor @xmath26 can be used to raise or lower indices , even though it depends on three coordinates but only has two - dimensional indices , because of the block - diagonality of the metric  @xmath20 .",
    "note also that in eq .",
    "we have written  @xmath27 rather than  @xmath28 , since the second form could be misinterpreted as the second contravariant component of  @xmath4 ( which is nonsense in this case ) .",
    "we shall follow this practice throughout the paper , but note that negative powers are written as  @xmath29 , since then there is no confusion .",
    "given the substrate vectors  @xmath17 , it is easy to solve for the covectors  @xmath30 , which are such that .",
    "then the bulk covectors are @xmath31 to first order in  @xmath4 , which can be checked by taking their dot product with the coordinate vectors   to see that .",
    "we will not need the covectors to higher order in  @xmath4 . from",
    ", we find the inverse metrics , @xmath32 where again the higher - order terms will not be needed .",
    "a crucial quantity is the determinant of the metric , @xmath33 where @xmath34 and    @xmath35    the area element at fixed  @xmath4 is given by  @xmath36 , and the volume element by  @xmath37 , since the  @xmath4 coordinate is unstretched with respect to the cartesian system .",
    "the volume per unit substrate area of a fluid layer of thickness  @xmath38 is thus @xmath39 the quantity  @xmath40 also tells us when the coordinate system ceases to be valid : if  @xmath41 , then the area element becomes singular .",
    "hence , the valid range for  @xmath4 is @xmath42 where  @xmath43 and  @xmath44 are the principal curvatures .",
    "@xcite if both principal curvatures are negative then the positive range in  @xmath4 is unrestricted ( convex region ) ; otherwise  @xmath4 is limited by the largest positive principal curvature .",
    "we now have all the geometrical equipment we need to solve fluid equations on the curved substrate .",
    "note that all the results of this section are exact , except for the covectors   and inverse metric  , which are valid to first order in  @xmath4 .",
    "for most applications in the literature of thin films , orthonormal coordinates have been the coordinates of choice .",
    "this is because the main substrate shapes that have been treated are planes , cylinders , and spheres , where orthonormal coordinates are readily available . for a general substrate shape ,",
    "orthonormal coordinates are difficult to construct and require numerical integration .",
    "singularities ( umbilics ) also cause problems .",
    "@xcite for our application  flow down a curved substrate ",
    "the monge representation of a surface  @xcite is the most convenient .",
    "the monge representation is a glorified name for a parametrization of the substrate by @xmath45 in three - dimensional cartesian space .",
    "following standard notation ,  @xcite we define    @xmath46    [ eq : mongeparams ]    the unnormalized , nonorthogonal tangents  @xmath47 and  @xmath48 are @xmath49 and their normalised cross product gives the normal to the substrate , @xmath50 the corresponding covectors are @xmath51 and  @xmath3 is its own covector .",
    "the metric tensor of the substrate and its inverse are @xmath52 with determinant @xmath53 the curvature tensor is @xmath54 which gives mean and gaussian curvatures @xmath55    we write the normalized gravity vector as  @xmath56 , so that the inclination angle  @xmath57 is zero for gravity pointing downwards , and for  @xmath58 positive  @xmath57 induces flow in the positive  @xmath5 direction .",
    "then we have the components @xmath59the specific parametrization of the substrate introduced in this section will not be needed in the derivation of the equations of motion ( sections  [ sec : masscons ] and  [ sec : dynamics ] ) , only in their solution ( section  [ sec : gensol ] ) .",
    "hence , a different parametrization could be used if called for by the geometry of the substrate .",
    "for instance , flow down a curved filament is better parametrized by cylindrical coordinates , or if the substrate has overhangs ( making  @xmath8 multivalued ) coordinates based on arc length are better .",
    "we remind the reader of our notational convention :    1 .",
    "quantities with a * tilde * ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath60 and  @xmath61 ) are evaluated between the substrate and the free surface ( in the ` bulk ' ) and are functions of  @xmath62 .",
    "2 .   quantities with an * overbar * ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath63 and  @xmath64 ) are evaluated on the free surface   and are functions of  @xmath65 .",
    "bare - headed ' quantities ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath17 and  @xmath66 ) are evaluated on the substrate  @xmath67 and are functions of  @xmath68 , or they are quantities that do not depend on  @xmath4 at all ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath3 ) .",
    "we introduce a velocity field @xmath69 associated with some time - dependent incompressible flow . here",
    "we depart from rrs  @xcite in two ways : first , the @xmath60 are not unit vectors , so the velocity components  @xmath70 are scaled differently ; second , we use @xmath60 and not  @xmath17 , so that the velocity field is expressed in terms of the bulk coordinate vectors rather than the substrate tangent vectors .",
    "this is slightly more natural in the present context , but is not crucial .",
    "mass conservation is imposed via the divergence - free condition ,  @xmath71 ; in terms of the coordinates in section  [ sec : coords ] , this is @xmath72 we integrate this from  @xmath73 to  @xmath38 and use the no - throughflow condition  @xmath74 to get @xmath75 now we use the kinematic boundary condition at the top surface , @xmath76 to find @xmath77 we define the mass flux vector @xmath78 which allows us to rewrite   as @xmath79 we divide through by  @xmath66 , @xmath80 where the covariant divergence  @xmath81 , with  @xmath82 denoting the covariant derivative with respect to  @xmath83 using the substrate metric  @xmath24 .",
    "@xcite in eq .  ,",
    "@xmath40 defined by eq .",
    "is evaluated at  @xmath19 , and  @xmath84 only enters  @xmath40 through  @xmath38 .",
    "hence , we can rewrite   as @xmath85 where  @xmath86 is the volume per unit substrate area given by eq .  .",
    "equation   thus embodies mass conservation .",
    "note that there were no assumptions on the thinness of the layer in this section .",
    "sections  [ sec : masscons ] involved only kinematic considerations , namely mass conservation and the kinematic boundary conditions at the free surface and bottom substrate .",
    "hence , everything we have done so far applies to any incompressible flow .",
    "now we will restrict to the problem of a viscous ( stokes ) flow driven by gravity , which satisfies the equation@xmath87 where  @xmath88 is the pressure and  @xmath89 is a unit vector in the direction of gravity .",
    "the velocity satisfies the boundary conditions    @xmath90    [ eq : bcs ]    where @xmath91 is the deviatoric stress ,  @xmath92 is the unit normal to the surface ,  @xmath93 are tangents to the surface , and  @xmath94 is the mean curvature of the surface .",
    "the stress conditions assumes that the gas above the surface has negligible viscosity and density .",
    "we have absorbed the constant density , viscosity , and strength of gravity into the velocity and pressure , so  @xmath95 stands for  @xmath96 ,  @xmath88 stands for  @xmath97 , and the surface tension  @xmath98 ( introduced below ) stands for  @xmath99 .",
    "this means that the velocity in   has units of squared length , the pressure has units of length , and the surface tension has units of squared length .    in the coordinates of section  [ sec : coords ] ,",
    "the location of the surface is @xmath100 and the surface tangents  @xmath101 are then given by @xmath102 the unit normal  @xmath92 is obtained by taking the cross product of the tangents and normalizing .    in the coordinates introduced in section  [ sec : coords ] , with the velocity field  , the stokes eq .",
    "becomes @xmath103 where we wrote @xmath104 with components given by  .",
    "note that , unlike the velocity field  , we have _ not _ written the gravity vector in terms of the bulk ( tilde ) coordinate vectors .",
    "this is to avoid  @xmath4 dependence in  @xmath105 and  @xmath106 .      following rrs ,  @xcite we rescale the variables to account for the thinness of the fluid layer .",
    "we do this not by rescaling  @xmath4 , but by rescaling  @xmath83 : we treat the variations in the substrate as being large - scale , whilst the depth of the layer is of order unity .",
    "hence , we introduce the rescalings @xmath107 where  @xmath108 is a small parameter ; all other variables are left unscaled . following standard practice , we immediately drop the  @xmath109 superscripts and deal only with the rescaled variables .",
    "the amplitude of the variations of the substrate are taken to be such that the vectors  @xmath17 and hence the substrate metric  @xmath110 are of order unity .",
    "all terms involving the curvature tensor  @xmath111 are of order  @xmath108 , because of the @xmath112 in the definition  .",
    "the continuity equation   is unchanged by the rescalings , and neither is the kinematic boundary condition  .",
    "the dynamical equation   becomes @xmath113 where  @xmath114 ,  @xmath115 , and  @xmath116 .",
    "as for the boundary conditions  , they simplify to    @xmath117    [ eq : bcseps ]    where @xmath118 with  @xmath119 the covariant laplacian of  @xmath38 , and @xmath120 we shall not need the higher - order terms in  .",
    "we now proceed in the usual manner and expand the fields as power series in  @xmath108 : @xmath121 where we have left out  @xmath122 since it is not needed in our development until later ( and it will not appear as an asymptotic series ) . at order",
    "@xmath123 , the velocity field and pressure satisfy @xmath124 where  @xmath125 .",
    "these are readily integrated to give @xmath126 where @xmath127 and the boundary conditions   have been applied .    at order",
    "@xmath108 , @xmath128 with solution @xmath129 where    @xmath130    to simplify these expressions , we made use of @xmath131 since  @xmath89 is a constant vector .",
    "now that we have  @xmath70 to first order in  @xmath108 , we can insert it in the definition of the mass flux vector  , @xmath132 which gives @xmath133 with @xmath134 @xmath135 where we have kept some second - order terms but neglected others : this will be explained when we find  @xmath122 below and is related to the exact preservation of the kinematic constraints of the problem .",
    "equation   with the flux   is the dynamical equation that governs the evolution of  @xmath38 .",
    "to order  @xmath108 , it is the same equation as that found by rrs ,  @xcite but in nonorthogonal coordinates rather than orthogonal coordinates .",
    "this is a straightforward generalization , but it is illuminating to rederive the equations in this setting , and allows a thorough introduction to all the notation .",
    "we will also need the quadratic terms in   below , and these are not present in rrs s formulation : this is not a failure of rrs but rather is required by the specific application we have in mind , namely particle advection .    in order to do particle advection in section  [ sec : advection ] , we will need the vertical velocity field ,  @xmath122 .",
    "it is obtained by integrating the continuity equation  , @xmath136 where the integral s lower bound enforces the no throughflow boundary condition at  @xmath67 .",
    "the kinematic boundary condition   is satisfied by   at  @xmath19 , since @xmath137 the first term on the right - hand side of   vanishes because of  , and the second gives the kinematic boundary condition  . but observe that to recover this boundary condition we need factors of  @xmath64 to cancel ; hence , a factor of  @xmath64 must appear multiplicatively in the integrand if we are to satisfy the kinematic boundary condition _ exactly _ ( _ i.e. _ , to all orders in  @xmath108 ) .",
    "this is the reason for keeping some second - order terms in   and  .",
    "note that this way the divergence - free condition   is also satisfied exactly .",
    "the easiest way to get the  @xmath4 coefficients for  @xmath138 is to combine   and   into @xmath139 valid to first order in  @xmath108 , where  @xmath140 and  @xmath141 .",
    "then , using  @xmath142 , we find from   @xmath143 where @xmath144 and the covariant divergence is defined after eq .  .",
    "the expression   for  @xmath122 is exact , given the first - order expressions  @xmath142 and   for  @xmath70 .",
    "we now seek steady solutions of eq .   with the mass flux vector  .",
    "the unknown function is the thickness field  @xmath145 .",
    "we characterize the shape of the substrate using the parametrization in section  [ sec : monge ] , and assume the substrate is periodic in  @xmath5 and  @xmath6 with unit period . in dimensionless form ,",
    "the independent input parameters of the problem are thus    1 .",
    "the inclination angle  @xmath57 and rotation angle  @xmath146 of the gravity vector [ eq .  ] ; [ item : angles ] 2 .   the thickness of the film at the corner ,  @xmath147;[item : eps ] 3 .",

    "the parameters  [ item : angles ] determines the speed and direction of the flow : the fluid is static for  @xmath149 .",
    "parameter  [ item : eps ] , the thickness of the film at the corner , effectively determines  @xmath108 .",
    "we shall thus drop  @xmath108 from the equations for the remainder of the paper , instead introducing the small parameter through  @xmath147 .",
    "parameter  [ item : shape ] is infinitely rich : even for a given substrate shape , we can still vary its height by scaling  @xmath8 by a constant .",
    "we shall limit ourselves to substrates of relatively simple harmonic shapes .",
    "consider first the case where the substrate has a translational symmetry .",
    "we may then orient our coordinates such that  @xmath8 is only a function of  @xmath6 . from eq .",
    ", we then have  @xmath150 . since nothing depends on  @xmath5 , we seek solutions of the form  @xmath151 .",
    "equation   then reduces to @xmath152 since  @xmath153 vanishes .",
    "if we keep only the  @xmath154 terms in  , we can solve   analytically , @xmath155 where the constant  @xmath156 is adjusted to satisfy the boundary condition  @xmath157 , and we have used  @xmath158 . the quantity in parentheses in   can become singular or negative , an indication that the higher - order terms can no longer be neglected . in that case",
    "@xmath159 still holds but we then have to solve an ode for  @xmath151",
    ". we shall not do this here and instead solve the general pde in the next section . for comparison ,",
    "the zeroth - order solution   is plotted along with the numerical first - order solution for a sinusoidal substrate and corner thickness  @xmath160 .     for a substrate with translational symmetry  @xmath161 , for  @xmath160 ,  @xmath162 ,  @xmath163 , and  @xmath164 .",
    "the solid line is the zeroth - order analytic solution  , and the dashed line is the first - order numerical solution . ]    the two agree well since the thickness is small .",
    "note that even though the velocity field depends only on two variables ( @xmath6 and  @xmath4 ) , the flow is actually three - dimensional , since  @xmath165 and  @xmath166 in   do not in general vanish , except in the special case  @xmath167 .",
    "we shall see in section  [ sec : advection ] that even this simple solution supports rather complicated trajectories .",
    "in general , eq .   with the mass flux vector   must be solved numerically .",
    "we use a fourth - order finite - difference scheme together with newton  kantorovich iteration  @xcite to converge to the steady solution .",
    "since the n  k scheme employs a linearization of the nonlinear equation to seek an improved guess , it allows us to check the linear stability of the flow for free , and all the flows presented here are stable .    in figure",
    "[ fig : chaos_sol ] we show the thickness field of a typical solution , for the substrate @xmath168 with  @xmath169 ,  @xmath170 ,  @xmath171 , and  @xmath164 . as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", we will set the surface tension to zero .",
    "the solutions presented in this paper typically have resolutions of  @xmath172 gridpoints , which is well - resolved enough .",
    "the acid test to see if we have enough numerical resolution is whether particle orbits ` spiral in ' to attractors , which is precluded if the flow is incompressible . for example , the orbits in the regular islands of fig .  [ fig : psec_2d_nochaos ] are nice and closed over many periods .",
    "when doing particle advection in section  [ sec : advection ] the thickness field is first resampled on a grid of  @xmath173 using fourier interpolation , and then the velocity field is evaluated off - gridpoints using linear interpolation .",
    "this has the advantage that the hardest part ( the resampling ) only needs to be done once at the beginning and stored .",
    "this is cheaper , for instance , than using a higher - order interpolation scheme on the coarser grid .",
    "to investigate the transport properties of the flow , we solve the advection equation @xmath174 for a steady velocity field  @xmath95 of the form   obtained numerically as described in section  [ sec : pdesolve ] .",
    "instead of converting our velocity field back to cartesian coordinates , we use the definition   of  @xmath175 and take its time derivative , assuming that the coordinates are a function of time , and use the chain rule : @xmath176 so that   becomes @xmath177 we can thus follow particle trajectories in out curved coordinates using",

    "thus , a poincar section of trajectories , made by recording intersections with the plane  @xmath184 , must look like fig .",

    "[ fig : traj_1d_norolls ] we see that four typical trajectories have roughly the same overall ` slope . '",
    "this leads to poor transport properties , since particles initially near each other remain near .",
    "this is due to the thinness of the layer which causes the zeroth - order velocity to dominate .",

    "this is of course a consequence of mass conservation , as the fluid is forced to flow more rapidly in the shallows .",
    "three representative trajectories are depicted in figure  [ fig : traj_1d_rolls ] , where the change in speed in the untrapped trajectory ( top ) is reflected in the slope of the curve .",
    "in contrast to fig .",
    "[ fig : traj_1d_norolls ] , the overall slope of a trajectory now depends on its depth .",
    "this important effect , reflected in the different slopes of the trajectories in fig .",
    "[ fig : traj_1d_rolls ] , leads to enhanced transport , in the sense that particles at different depths have very different histories .",
    "furthermore , the slope ( or lateral drift rate ) of a trajectory is not monotonic in the depth , since it is due to a complicated resonance between the lateral motion and downslope topography .",
    "if the inclination angle  @xmath57 is too small , or  @xmath146 is such that the furrows are too aligned with the incoming flow , then untrapped trajectories disappear but the flow also develops dry spots , since the fluid does nt make it over the crests of the bumps : it is flowing in the ` gutters ' of the substrate .",
    "this takes us outside the scope of the present theory and we do not consider such cases .",
    "in section  [ sec : transsym ] we looked at trajectories for the simplest type of substrate , those possessing a translational symmetry .",
    "we now want to investigate the potential for creating flows that exhibit chaotic trajectories , leading to chaotic advection .",
    "@xcite breaking the translational symmetry of the substrate is essential for the existence of chaotic trajectories , otherwise the trajectories obey a two - dimensional autonomous system , as in section  [ sec : transsym ] , which can not exhibit chaos . given that this translational symmetry is broken , there are three modifications to the flow that increase the chances of developing chaotic trajectories :    1 .",
    "break discrete symmetries of the substrate ; 2 .",
    "make the fluid deeper ( but still thin ) ; 3 .",
    "make the inclination angle  @xmath57 smaller .",
    "the first point removes barriers to transport associated with symmetries .",
    "@xcite the second point allows particles more vertical freedom to break the two - dimensional constraint that leads to integrable motion , by bringing in first - order terms in the velocity field .",
    "the third point allows the particles more time to move laterally during one periodic length of the domain by decreasing the flow velocity . here ,",
    "by laterally we mean a direction perpendicular to the mean flow .    as an illustration we will use the substrate with height function given by  . the first term in   breaks the translational symmetry , and the second term is a perturbation that breaks the discrete symmetry  @xmath186",
    ". thus , the substrate with those parameter values has a good chance of exhibiting chaos , according to our first point above .",
    "consider for an inclination angle  @xmath187 for the substrate  , with a corner thickness  @xmath169 .",
    "this means that the fluid is reasonably thick , so our second point is satisfied . but the poincar section in fig .",
    "[ fig : psec_2d_nochaos ]    clearly shows that no chaos is present , since the phase space is foliated by one - dimensional curves .",
    "( though very small regions of chaos could in principle be present , they are clearly not important here . )",
    "figure  [ fig : traj_2d_nochaos ] shows four typical trajectories , taken at about the same initial  @xmath6 but at different depths  @xmath4 . the three untrapped trajectories undergo ` near - trapping , ' in the sense that they appear to flirt with the idea of entering the trapped regions .",
    "this motion is periodic , but the period depends on the trajectory .",
    "there is thus a depth dependence as for the case in fig .",
    "[ fig:1d_rolls ] .",
    "now we apply our third modification from the list above and decrease the inclination angle to  @xmath170 .",
    "this gives the thickness field depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : chaos_sol ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : psec_2d_chaos ] shows a poincar section for the resulting flow .",
    "the phase space clearly exhibits considerable chaotic behavior , as evidenced by the poincar section not being foliated by one - dimensional surfaces [ compare to fig .",
    "[ fig : psec_2d_nochaos ] ] .",
    "there are still a few regions of regular behavior , indicated by the four visible islands , which correspond to islands in fig .",
    "[ fig : psec_2d_nochaos ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : traj_2d_chaos ] six trajectories are plotted : the bottom three are trapped in the islands . the top three undergo transitions between long untrapped motions , where the trajectories go diagonally across the substrate , and short trapped motions .",
    "this trapped - untrapped behavior is typical of chaotic dynamics in the neighborhood of islands .",
    "we have derived an equation describing the gravity - driven motion of a thin viscous flow on a curved substrate .",
    "this is the same equation as in rrs  @xcite expressed in nonorthogonal coordinates , and in addition including second - order correction terms to satisfy exactly the kinematic boundary condition at the free surface .",
    "this is essential for particle advection , since otherwise the small errors at the surface are enough to cause the particles to escape the domain .",
    "we then investigated the character of fluid trajectories for four cases of increasing complexity .",
    "we observe a hierarchy of complex motions :    * for a substrate with translational symmetry at a large inclination angle , the flow is very thin and particle moves in uniform layers , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : psec_1d_norolls ] .",
    "the lateral motion of the particles is essentially independent of their depth [ fig .",
    "[ fig : traj_1d_norolls ] ] . * for the same substrate with a smaller inclination angle , the flow becomes thicker over furrows , and zones of recirculation form .",
    "these are seen as islands in fig .",
    "[ fig : psec_1d_rolls ]",
    ". two new effects are visible in the particles trajectories [ fig .",
    "[ fig : traj_1d_rolls ] ] : some are trapped inside the rolls , and others exhibit different rates of lateral displacement in  @xmath6 .",
    "this means that this flow has much better transport properties since particles initially near each other will separate rapidly ( but not exponentially since there is no chaos ) . *",
    "if we break the translational symmetry and use a fully two - dimensional surface such as  , we observe the formation of more islands ( four visible in total ) of trapped trajectories [ fig .",
    "[ fig : psec_2d_nochaos ] ] .",
    "the trajectories ` bounce off ' the various islands causing complicated , but regular , oscillations [ fig .",
    "[ fig : traj_2d_nochaos ] ] . * finally , decreasing the inclination angle of the previous substrate preserves the same four islands [ fig .",
    "[ fig : psec_2d_chaos ] ] , but now the trajectories undergo a succession of random trapped and untrapped events , analogous to lvy flights observed in experiments in a rotating tank [ fig .  [",
    "fig : traj_2d_chaos ] ] .",
    "@xcite this is the most effective transport achieved here , since particles initially near each other will separate exponentially , unless they are both inside the same island .",
    "we used three modifications to the flow to increase the complexity of particle trajectories : 1 . breaking discrete symmetries of the substrate ; 2 . making the fluid deeper",
    "; 3 . making the inclination angle smaller . of the three ,",
    "we expect the first two to have a similar effect on any other type of thin flow , say one driven by marangoni stresses or shear at the free surface .",
    "the last simply says that decreasing the mean velocity of the flow can make lateral motions more important , heightening the chance of observing complex dynamics .    the lateral motion ( that is , perpendicular to the mean flow direction ) of particles is fairly small .",
    "we have made little effort to optimize this , preferring to focus our attention on test cases as a first object of study .",
    "experiments would be desirable here to see if the observed lateral motion is of the right order of magnitude .",
    "it is tempting to try to compute numerically an effective diffusion coefficient by simulating large numbers of particle trajectories .",
    "however , the numerical codes used here are too slow to achieve the high statistics needed to measure these coefficients with confidence .",
    "rather , we hope to use techniques from homogenization theory to calculate the large - scale transport properties .",
    "@xcite    the generalized coordinate setting introduced in section  [ sec : coords ] is applicable to any set of dynamical equations , and could be used to model flows over complicated surbstrates in a fairly straightforward manner .",
    "it also allows for a time - dependent substrate , such as when it grows by solidification ,  @xcite though we have not treated such effects here .",
    "finally , the substrates used here were periodic in both directions , but it would be useful to quantify transport for random landscapes , consisting for instance of imperfections on the surface of a material .",
