    "an important problem in future telecommunication systems will be how to send large amount of data such as video through a wireless channel at high rate with high reliability in a mobile environment .",
    "one way to enable the high rate communication on the scattering - rich wireless channel is use of multiple transmit and receive antennas .",
    "it is well known that the capacity of a wireless channel linearly increases as the number of transmit and receive antennas under the condition that total power and bandwidth of signals are constant  @xcite .",
    "a wireless communication system with multiple transmit and receive antennas is called multi - input multi - output ( mimo ) system and an encoding / modulation method for mimo system is called space - time code .    in the design of space - time codes ,",
    "it is desirable to reduce the size of the circuit for encoding and decoding .",
    "jiang et al .",
    "@xcite and khan et al .",
    "@xcite derived a necessary and sufficient condition for symbolwise maximum likelihood ( ml ) decoding on linear dispersion codes ( ldc )  @xcite , and such code design is named single symbol decodable design ( ssdd ) .",
    "complex linear processing orthogonal design ( clpod )  @xcite , which is the subclass of ssdd , has full diversity and maximum coding gain because of an additional condition on codewords .",
    "many researchers have studied concrete construction  @xcite , rate  @xcite , ber and the capacity utilization efficiency  @xcite of clpod .",
    "the capacity utilization efficiency of a code can be measured by calculating its attainable maximum mutual information ( mmi ) .",
    "mmi of a code is defined as the capacity of a channel which consists of an encoder of the target code and the original channel , so it is an upper bound on how much one can send information with vanishing error probability by using the code .",
    "therefore we know how much a space - time block code utilizes the capacity of wireless channel by calculating their mmi .",
    "mmi is also an important measure of an inner code of a concatenated code because it corresponds to maximum possible information rate with vanishing error probability by taking the block length of an outer code large .",
    "hassibi and hochwald  @xcite computed mmi of alamouti s code  @xcite and mmi of an example of rate-3/4 clpod and mentioned that these values are far below original channel capacity with more than one receive antenna .",
    "they also proposed ldcs whose mmi are close to original channel capacity for several numbers of transmit / receive antennas .",
    "sandhu and paulraj  @xcite derived the expression of mmi of general clpod and showed that for rayleigh fading channel , the value equals to original channel capacity only when one receive antenna is used .",
    "however , there is no knowledge of mmi of ssdd , which is a subclass of ldc and includes clpod as a special case .",
    "the importance of this problem is also mentioned in the literature  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we compute mmi of ssdd over frequency non - selective quasi - static rayleigh fading channel and clarify the necessary symbol rate at which ssdd utilizes full capacity of original channel .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec.2 ] , we introduce a mathematical model for mimo systems and the definitions of ssdd and clpod . in section  [ sec.3 ]",
    ", we derive an upper bound on mmi of ssdd .",
    "also we give alternative derivation of the exact expression of mmi of clpod . in section  [ sec.4 ]",
    ", we show the tightness of the upper bound on mmi of ssdd by comparing it with delay optimal complex orthogonal design ( cod ) , which is a subclass of clpod at the same symbol rate",
    ". then we clarify the necessary symbol rate of ssdd at which mmi of ssdd can attain original channel capacity .",
    "we show that the necessary symbol rate is much larger than that of clpod upper bounded by 3/4 .",
    "finally , section  [ sec.5 ] provides our conclusions .",
