    "in modelling and analysis of forward and futures prices in commodity markets , the _ risk premium _ plays an important role .",
    "it is defined as the difference between the forward price and the expected commodity spot price at delivery , and the classical theory predicts a _ negative _ risk premium .",
    "the economical argument for this is that producers of the commodity is willing to pay a premium for hedging their production ( see geman  @xcite for a discussion , as well as a list of references ) .",
    "geman and vasicek  @xcite argued that in power markets , the consumers may hedge the price risk using forward contracts which are close to delivery , and thus creating a _ positive _ premium .",
    "power is a non - storable commodity , and as such may experience rather large price variations over short time ( sometimes referred to as spikes ) .",
    "one might observe a risk premium which may be positive in the short end of the forward market , and negative in the long end where the producers are hedging their power generation .",
    "a theoretical and empirical foundation for this is provided in , for example , bessembinder and lemon  @xcite and benth , cartea and kiesel @xcite .",
    "when deriving the forward price , one specifies a pricing probability and computes the forward price as the conditional expected spot at delivery . in the power market , this pricing probability is not necessarily a so - called equivalent martingale measure , or a risk neutral probability ( see bingham and kiesel @xcite ) , as the spot is not tradeable in the usual sense .",
    "thus , a pricing probability can a priori be any equivalent measure , and in effect is an indirect specification of the risk premium . in this paper",
    "we suggest a new class of pricing measures which gives a stochastically varying risk premium .",
    "we will focus our considerations on the power market , where typically a spot price model may take the form as a two - factor mean reversion dynamics .",
    "lucia and schwartz  @xcite considered two - factor models for the electricity spot price dynamics in the nordic power market nordpool . both arithmetic and geometric models where suggested , that is , either directly modelling the spot price by a two - factor dynamics , or assuming such a model for the logarithmic spot prices .",
    "their models were based on brownian motion and , as such , not able to capture the extreme variations in the power spot markets .",
    "cartea and figueroa  @xcite used a compound poisson process to model spikes , that is , extreme price jumps which are quickly reverted back to `` normal levels '' .",
    "benth , altyt benth and koekebakker  @xcite give a general account on multi - factor models based on ornstein - uhlenbeck processes driven by both brownian motion and lvy processes .",
    "empirical studies suggest a stationary power spot price dynamics after explaining deterministic seasonal variations ( see e.g. barndorff - nielsen , benth and veraart  @xcite for a study of spot prices at eex , the german power exchange ) .",
    "we will in this paper focus on a two - factor model for the spot , where each factor is an ornstein - uhlenbeck process , driven by a brownian motion and a jump process , respectively .",
    "the first factor models the `` normal variations '' of the spot price , whereas the second accounts for sudden jumps ( spikes ) due to unexpected imbalances in supply and demand .",
    "the standard approach in power markets is to specify a pricing measure which is preserving the lvy property .",
    "this is called the esscher transform ( see benth et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and works for lvy processes as the girsanov transform with a constant parameter for brownian motion .",
    "the effect of doing such a measure change is to adjust the mean reversion level , and it is known that the risk premium becomes deterministic and typically either positive or negative for all maturities along the forward curve .",
    "we propose a class of measure changes which slows down the _ speed of mean reversion _ of the two factors . as it turns out , in conjunction with an esscher transform as mentioned above",
    ", we can produce a stochastically varying risk premium , where potential positive premiums in the short end of the market can be traced back to sudden jumps in the spike factor being slowed down under the pricing measure .",
    "this result holds for arithmetic spot models , whereas the geometric ones are much harder to analyse under this change of probability .",
    "the class of probabilities preserves the ornstein - uhlenbeck structure of the factors , and as such may be interpreted as a _ dynamic structure preserving measure change_. for the lvy driven component , the lvy property is lost in general , and we obtain a rather complex jump process with state - dependent ( random ) compensator measure .",
    "we can explicitly describe the density process for our measure change .",
    "the theoretical contribution of this paper , besides the new insight on risk premium , is a proof that the density process is a true martingale process , indeed verifying that we have constructed a",
    "_ probability measure_. this verification is not straightforward because the kernels used to define the density process , through stochastic exponentiation , are stochastic and unbounded .",
    "hence , the usual criterion by lpingle - mmin @xcite is difficult to apply and , furthermore , it does not provide sharp results .",
    "we follow the same line of reasoning as in a very recent paper by klebaner and lipster @xcite .",
    "although their result is more general than ours in some respects , it does not apply directly to our case because we need some additional integrability requirements .",
    "the proof is roughly as follows .",
    "first , we reduce the problem to show the uniform integrability of the sequence of random variables obtained by evaluating at the end of the trading period the localised density process .",
    "this sequence of random variables naturally induces a sequence of measure changes which , combined with an easy inequality for the logarithm function , allow us to get rid of the stochastic exponential in the expression to be bounded .",
    "finally , we can reduce the problem to get an uniform bound for the second moment of the factors under these new probability measures .    interestingly , as our pricing probability is reducing the speed of mean reversion , we might in the extreme situation `` turn off '' the mean reversion completely ( by reducing it to zero ) . for example , if we take the brownian factor as the case , we can have a stationary dynamics of the `` normal variations '' in the market , but when looking at the process under the pricing probability the factor can be non - stationary , that is , a drifted brownian motion . a purely stationary dynamics for the spot will produce constant forward prices in the long end of the market , something which is not observed empirically . hence , the inclusion of non - stationary factors are popular in modelling the spot - forward markets . in many studies of commodity spot and forward markets ,",
    "one is considering a two - factor model with one non - stationary and one stationary component . the stationary part explains the short term variations , while the non - stationary is supposed to account for long - term price fluctuations in the spot ( see gibson and schwartz  @xcite and schwartz and smith  @xcite for such models applied to oil markets ) .",
    "indeed , the power spot models in lucia and schwartz  @xcite are of this type .",
    "it is hard to detect the long term factor in spot price data , and one is usually filtering it out from the forward prices using contracts far from delivery . theoretically , such contracts should have a dynamics being proportional to the long term factor .",
    "contrary to this approach , one may in view of our new results , suggest a _ stationary _ spot dynamics and introduce a pricing measure which turns one of the factors into a non - stationary dynamics .",
    "this would imply that one could directly fit a two - factor stationary spot model to power data , and next calibrate a measure change to account for the long term variations in the forward prices by turning off ( or significantly slow down ) the speed of mean reversion .",
    "our results are presented as follows : in the next section we introduce the basic assumptions and properties satisfied by the factors in our model . then , in section [ secchangeofmeasure ] , we define the new change of measure and prove the main results regarding the uniform integrability of its density process .",
    "we deal with the brownian and pure jump case separately .",
    "finally , in section [ secstudyofriskprem ] , we recall the arithmetic and geometric spot price models .",
    "we compute the forward price processes induced by this change of measure and we discuss the risk premium profiles that can be obtained .",
