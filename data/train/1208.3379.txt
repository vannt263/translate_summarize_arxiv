    "the measurement of heavy quark production provides a test of many aspect of qcd .",
    "a considerable progress in the qcd calculations for heavy - quark production has been done in the recent years .",
    "the theoretical results presented at this workshop are reviewed in section  [ sec : th ] .",
    "many new results have been presented on the production of heavy quarks from different types of collisions : deep inelastic scattering , photoproduction , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and nuclear collisions ( pbpb , auau , cucu , dau ) .",
    "results on charm and beauty production are summarized in section  [ sec : cb ] . due to space constraints the results from heavy - ion collisions , which would deserve a dedicated summary ,",
    "are not discussed .",
    "the measurements of top quark production are discussed in section  [ sec : top ] with the new results on top properties .",
    "finally section  [ sec : other ] summarizes the updates in heavy hadron spectroscopy and on searches beyond the standard model exploiting b - hadron decays .",
    "deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) data form the backbone of global analyses of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "precise determinations of pdfs require the inclusion of heavy ( charm , bottom ) quark mass terms in the calculation of dis structure functions at higher orders in perturbation theory . in fixed order perturbation theory the charm contribution @xmath4 to the inclusive dis structure function @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is given as a convolution of pdfs @xmath7 with heavy quark wilson coefficients @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the charm quark mass and @xmath12 the factorization scale ( which has been identified with the renormalization scale ) .",
    "for neutral current dis , the coefficients @xmath13 are currently known to order @xmath14 . at this conference",
    ", progress has been reported to construct approximate heavy quark wilson coefficients at order @xmath15 using the information from different kinematic limits .",
    "due to mass factorization , in the limit @xmath16 the @xmath13 can be written as a convolution of light flavor wilson coefficients @xmath17 with universal operator matrix elements ( omes ) @xmath18 : @xmath19 indicating the loop order as upper index one can write generically @xmath20 where the light flavor wilson coefficients are available up to order @xmath15 @xcite . in order to construct the heavy quark wilson coefficient functions @xmath21 in the asymptotic limit",
    ", the omes are needed up to the same order @xmath15 and partial results for certain color factors have been obtained very recently @xcite . as an important application ,",
    "the omes are needed for the definition of variable flavor number schemes since they enter the matching conditions for the pdfs with @xmath22 and @xmath23 active flavours .",
    "in addition to the asymptotic limit @xmath16 , it is possible to exploit universal features in the threshold region @xmath24 where sudakov logarithms @xmath25 can be resummed and in the high energy limit where information on leading and next - to - leading small-@xmath26 logarithms is available in order to construct improved heavy quark coefficient functions at order @xmath15 @xcite .    as is well - known , the heavy quark coefficient functions @xmath27 are not ir - safe : @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , most of the modern global analyses of pdfs use so called general mass variable flavor number schemes ( gm - vfns ) where the large logarithms @xmath30 are removed from the coefficients @xmath27 and resummed by heavy quark initiated subprocesses with evolved heavy quark parton distributions . at the same time , finite mass terms @xmath31 are retained in the subtracted ir - safe wilson coefficients @xmath32 . for use in precision determinations of pdfs",
    ", these gm - vfns have to be formulated at nnlo and f.  olness presented approximate results for the neutral current structure functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the acot gm - vfns @xcite up to order @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "most of the heavy flavour schemes have been formulated for inclusive dis processes and are used in global analyses of pdfs . on the other hand ,",
    "less inclusive processes provide many additional tests of pqcd in various kinematic regions and are closer to the experimental measurements .",
    "however , theoretical calculations are much more challenging and even more so if heavy quark mass effects have to be taken into account .",
    "nevertheless , any heavy flavour scheme should also be applicable to less inclusive observables in order to be considered a general formalism of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) including heavy quark masses @xcite . relying on a factorization theorem with heavy quarks @xcite ,",
    "acot - like variants of the gm - vfns have been applied to inclusive heavy meson production in dis @xcite , photoproduction @xcite , hadroproduction @xcite , and electron - positron annihilation @xcite . at this conference",
    "updated numerical results for inclusive @xmath35 and @xmath36 meson production in the gm - vfns at the lhc have been presented @xcite . furthermore , a new method for calculating dis jet production in the acot scheme has been reported extending the dipole subtraction formalism to all possible qcd splitting processes with heavy quarks including splittings of coloured , massive particles in the initial state @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature of exclusive processes with a heavy quark in the final state is that they are useful to probe heavy flavour pdfs . in most global analyses of pdfs the charm and bottom distributions",
    "are generated `` radiatively '' using perturbatively calculated boundary conditions . with other words ,",
    "no new fit parameters are associated to the charm and bottom pdfs . however",
    ", a purely perturbative treatment might not be adequate , in particular for the charm quark with mass @xmath37 gev , and in fact non - perturbative models exist that predict an intrinsic charm ( ic ) component in the nucleon @xcite .",
    "clearly , the heavy quark pdfs should be tested since they play an important role in some key processes at the lhc @xcite . a promising way to constrain models on ic",
    "is the measurement of inclusive @xmath35 meson production at rhic or with the lhcb detector at the lhc where at forward rapidities the differential cross section can be enhanced by a factor of up to 5 compared to the prediction with a radiatively generated charm pdf @xcite .",
    "another process which is very sensitive to the heavy quark pdf is direct photon production in association with a heavy quark jet @xcite .",
    "data from the d0 experiment at the tevatron @xcite overshoot the standard nlo qcd predictions @xcite at large transverse photon momenta and the inclusion of an intrinsic heavy quark component in the nucleon can reduce the difference between data and theory but not fully resolve it .",
    "measurements of this process at rhic and the lhc probe the heavy quark pdfs in different regions of the momentum fraction @xmath26 and would be useful to shed more light on the current situation .",
    "in addition , the measurements at the lhc would provide a baseline for @xmath38 production in @xmath39 @xcite and @xmath40 collisions @xcite .",
    "finally , work has been presented on @xmath41 production in the @xmath42-factorization formalism . the predictions for @xmath35 meson production at the lhc",
    "somehow undershoot the data of alice and lhcb ( preliminary ) .",
    "furthermore , the production of two @xmath41 pairs in a formalism with double - parton scattering has been discussed .",
    "the predicted cross sections for @xmath43 at the lhc receive similar contributions from single - parton and from double - parton scattering @xcite .      the charmonium @xmath44 has been extensively studied experimentally ever since its discovery in 1973 .",
    "however , theoretically , heavy quarkonium production and decay are still not well understood . a rigorous framework for theoretical studies",
    "is provided by the factorization theorem of nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite where the charmonium production cross section factorizes into calculable short distance cross sections for the production of a heavy quark pair @xmath45 $ ] in a fock state @xmath46 and nonperturbative long distance matrix elements ( ldmes ) @xmath47\\rangle$ ] which have to be extracted from experiment .",
    "the fock states are described by quantum numbers for spin , orbital and total angular momentum and color , @xmath48}}$ ] . for @xmath44 production",
    "the following states are considered : @xmath49}}= { ^3\\!s_1^{[1 ] } } ,   { ^1\\!s_0^{[8 ] } } , { ^3\\!s_1^{[8 ] } } , { ^3\\!p_j^{[1]}}$ ] including color - octet ( co ) states @xmath50=[8]$ ] in addition to color singlet ( cs ) states @xmath50=1 $ ] .",
    "a nlo nrqcd analysis of the @xmath44 yield and polarization based on the results in @xcite can be summarized as follows @xcite : ( i ) a global analysis of unpolarized world @xmath44 data from hadroproduction , photoproduction , two - photon scattering and electron - positron annihilation experiments allows to determine the three co ldmes @xmath51}})\\rangle ,   \\langle{\\cal o^{j/\\psi}}({^1\\!s_0^{[8]}})\\rangle , \\langle{\\cal o^{j/\\psi}}({^3\\!s_1^{[8]}})\\rangle$ ] and the data are well described . here",
    "it is important to note that hadroproduction data alone can not constrain all three matrix elements even including polarization data .",
    "( ii ) the predictions from the nlo nrqcd global analysis of unpolarized world data do not agree with @xmath44 polarization data from cdf i and the new measurements from cdf ii .",
    "with other words it is not possible to describe the unpolarized hadro- and photoproduction data and the cdf polarization measurements with one set of co ldmes .",
    "conversely , the new measurements from alice agree with nlo nrqcd within errors .",
    "future precise polarization measurements at the lhc will have the potential to confirm or dismiss the universality of the ldmes .      in the past few years",
    ", there has been impressive theoretical progress in the calculation of top quark pair production beyond nlo .",
    "a highlight has certainly been the completion of the exact nnlo qcd corrections to @xmath52 which represents a theoretical breakthrough because it is the first ever nnlo calculation involving more than two coloured particles and/or massive fermions @xcite . as a last missing piece for this calculation ,",
    "suitable counter terms needed to regulate infrared divergences in the interference terms of tree - level and one - loop amplitudes with three particles in the final state ( of which two are massive ) have been derived in @xcite . for @xmath53",
    "the partonic cross section reads in nnlo ( @xmath54 ) : @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "the scale - dependent terms @xmath57 with @xmath58 can be generally computed from the lower order functions @xmath59 by renormalization group methods @xcite so the new information resides in the function @xmath60 .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to perform an all order resummation of universal sudakov logarithms @xmath25 , which become dominant close to the production threshold ( @xmath61 ) , at next - to - next - to - leading logarithmic ( nnll ) accuracy .",
    "the nnlo+nnll result allows one to predict the @xmath62 production cross section at the tevatron with significantly improved precision at the level of 3% @xcite .",
    "a c++ program for the calculation of the @xmath62 total cross section including the full nnlo corrections is publicly available @xcite .",
    "in addition to the production threshold ( @xmath63 ) all order resummations can also be performed for the pair invariant mass ( pim ) threshold @xmath64 treating the @xmath62 system as a pair and the one particle inclusive ( 1pi ) threshold @xmath65 where one integrates over the phase space of one of the heavy quarks .",
    "the latter two thresholds are relevant for differential distributions in the pair invariant mass and for the transverse momentum or rapidity of the observed heavy quark , respectively , in addition to the total cross section and different approaches to resum them exist in the literature @xcite .",
    "the differences between the methods concern formally subleading terms which , however , can be numerically important . alternatively , approximate nnlo theories can be constructed by combining the information from the exact nlo calculation with all universal ( soft and collinear ) logarithmic terms appearing at nnlo , see also sec .  [ sec : th_dis ] .    within the approach based on soft - collinear - effective theory ( scet ) , phenomenological predictions for the total cross section @xcite and various differential distributions @xcite at the tevatron and the lhc",
    "have been discussed @xcite .",
    "furthermore , using standard momentum - space resummation in pqcd , a large number of numerical results for the differential and total cross sections for both , top pair @xcite and single top production @xcite , have been presented by n. kidonakis @xcite .",
    "one observable which has received a lot of attention recently is the top quark charge asymmetry .",
    "it was shown , that the higher order predictions are consistent with nlo and hence do not resolve the discrepancy with the tevatron data at high invariant mass and rapidity @xcite .",
    "more exclusive top observables are important because they can have sizable production cross sections or constitute important backgrounds for higgs searches . here",
    "theoretical progress has been achieved by merging exact nlo calculations with parton showers . at this conference ,",
    "results have been presented for the production of top quark pairs with one jet ( @xmath66 ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , several processes ( @xmath66 @xcite , @xmath67 @xcite , @xmath68 @xcite and @xmath69 ) have been implemented into the powhel framework as has been discussed in a talk by a.  kardos @xcite .",
    "measurements of the production cross sections of prompt @xmath44 have been performed by the four lhc collaborations .",
    "in addition cms  @xcite and lhcb  @xcite also presented measurements of @xmath70 production which is less influenced by feed - down from the decays of heavier states .",
    "these results are reasonably well described by the nrqcd predictions including cs+co contributions at nlo as discussed in the theory section  [ sec : th ] .",
    "calculations based on the @xmath42 factorization approach including only cs diagrams are also able to describe the data .",
    "the situation is less clear when the polarization of the produced state is considered .",
    "the new measurements of the @xmath44 and @xmath71 helicity , presented respectively by the alice  @xcite and cdf  @xcite collaborations , agree marginally with the nrqcd nlo prediction .",
    "the cdf @xmath72 result , obtained with a integrated luminosity of 5.7  fb@xmath73 , is in good agreement with previous cdf data obtained with lower luminosity while the disagreement with the measurement by the d0 collaboration persists .      the h1 and zeus collaborations are finalizing their effort to measure charm and beauty production in dis and to provide the best possible measurement of @xmath74 , the component of the inclusive structure function @xmath33 with charm in the final state .",
    "the h1 collaboration published their final measurement of @xmath75 production in dis  @xcite , while zeus presented preliminary results on @xmath75 production and on charmed jets tagged using secondary vertices  @xcite .",

    "belle observed three such resonances , the @xmath127 and @xmath128 produced in @xmath129 decays  @xcite , however babar have not confirmed any of them  @xcite .",
    "since the upper limits set by babar on the product branching fractions do not contradict the belle measurements , the conclusive results are expected to come from the lhc experiments .",
    "both lhcb and cms have demonstrated that they will play an important role in studies of @xmath41 spectroscopy . using only a small fraction of their data",
    ", they measured precisely mass and @xmath2 production of the @xmath116  @xcite . the @xmath130 yield expected with the 2011 run data",
    "will hopefully allow them to discriminate between the two possible spin - parities of the @xmath116 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "experimental data on the bottomonium spectrum remain even more incomplete .",
    "the field has become lively once @xmath36-factories took data at @xmath133 s other than @xmath134 , which allowed babar to discover the ground bottomonium @xmath135 in the @xmath136 transitions  @xcite .",
    "belle studies of the data collected at the @xmath137 have revealed that its properties differ from other @xmath133 s .",
    "a reason for abnormally large transitions @xmath138",
    "@xcite are two charged @xmath109-like states @xmath139 that mediate these transitions  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath140 transitions have been found to be as large and also saturated with the @xmath141 amplitudes .",
    "interpretation of the @xmath142 states as @xmath143 molecules seems to be supported by their masses and decay amplitude pattern  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath140 transitions allowed the first observation of the spin - singlet @xmath144 and @xmath145 bottomonia  @xcite .",
    "belle have also reported a measurement of the mass and the first measurement of the width of the @xmath135 produced in @xmath146 . measured",
    "@xmath147 hyperfine splitting improved agreement with the theoretical predictions  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath109 spectroscopy is also studied at the hadron colliders .",
    "the first particle observed at the lhc has been a candidate for @xmath148 found at @xmath149 by atlas in @xmath150 transitions  @xcite ; it has been soon confirmed by d  @xcite .",
    "lhcb has taken over a leading role in studies of @xmath1-hadrons being out of reach of the @xmath36-factories .",
    "the presented results on @xmath151 mesons , such as a mass measurement using the @xmath152 decays , their production relative to topologically similar @xmath153 reference decays , as well as the first observation of the @xmath154 decays , comprise an important experimental input on this heaviest @xmath1-meson observed so far  @xcite .",
    "the world best mass measurements of @xmath1-baryons : @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 and study of the @xmath158 production allowing extraction of the @xmath159 production fraction , nicely improve previous tevatron measurements .",
    "search for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) is nowadays one of the main goals of particle physics .",
    "precision studies of the @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 decays which in the sm are either suppressed or forbidden , allow one to search for new physics ( np ) effects .",
    "virtual contributions of np particles can enter the diagrams underlying the studied processes and modify the sm predictions for various observables , like decay rate , cp violation or polarization .",
    "the deviation of a given observable from the sm will be a sign of np , whereas the study of correlations between observables will allow one to identify the nature of np .",
    "such indirect searches are complementary to the direct ones performed at the lhc .",
    "all the measurements performed so far to overconstrain the unitarity triangle ( ut ) describing @xmath36 meson system seem to be consistent with each other within their uncertainties  @xcite and thus constrain np corrections to be at most at the @xmath163 level .",
    "numerous tensions between the measurements and the sm predictions reported over the last few years encourage to investigate them further with increased precision .",
    "the asymmetry of same - sign muon pairs from semileptonic @xmath160 decays was found by d@xmath164 to be larger than the sm prediction by @xmath165  @xcite .",
    "this asymmetry is related to @xmath166 violation in @xmath167 and @xmath168 mixing .",
    "a phase entering the latter , the @xmath169 , can be independently measured via a time dependent analysis of @xmath170 , where @xmath166 violation occurs via interference between the decay proceeding with and without @xmath171 mixing .",
    "updated measurements of the @xmath169 and @xmath172 by cdf  @xcite and lhcb  @xcite show that the overall agreement with the sm is good .",
    "this might suggest the np contribution in the @xmath167 mixing , and such a picture seems to be supported by a @xmath173 discrepancy between the @xmath174 ut parameter measured directly from the @xmath175 decays and indirectly determined from the global fit to all the remaining ut measurements  @xcite .",
    "the golden mode for np searches , the @xmath176 , is very clean from the theoretical as well as the experimental point of view .",
    "the sm prediction for its branching ratio is only @xmath177 , while a broad class of np models can enhance it up to @xmath178 .",
    "a global effort has been made to find the @xmath176 signal and the strongest constraint of @xmath179 comes from lhcb  @xcite .",
    "cdf measurement updated with their full data sample  @xcite has not reinforced previously found signal increase .",
    "contrary to the @xmath180 mixing , where any np effects would be obscured by long distance contributions , @xmath166 violation in @xmath35 meson decays has been over last the years suggested to be a good place for np searches .",
    "in the sm it is expected to be very small , at the level of @xmath181 at most , and experimental measurements have reached that precision only recently .",
    "first evidence of cp violation in charm decays has been found by lhcb in the measurement of @xmath182  @xcite , which in a first approximation corresponds to the difference of direct cp violation . together with the result reported by cdf  @xcite",
    ", no cp violation scenario is excluded at the @xmath183 level . however , according to the revised theoretical calculations such an increased cp violation can be still accommodated within the sm  @xcite .",
    "indirect searches for np in the heavy flavour sector have been very lively .",
    "many rare processes only come within reach thanks to increasing sensitivity obtained with data from lhc and full data samples from @xmath36-factories and tevatron experiments being analyzed .",
    "some of the important studies , like precision @xmath184 , polarization measurements in @xmath185 , lepton flavour violation in @xmath162 decays will be feasible only with super@xmath36-factories being under construction .",
    "there has been theoretical progress concerning approximate nnlo calculations for heavy quark structure functions in deep inelastic scattering , the extension of the acot heavy flavour scheme to jet production , and advances in top physics ( soft gluon resummations , merging with parton showers ) where the highlight is clearly the first complete nnlo qcd prediction for top pair production in the @xmath0 annihilation channel .",
    "furthermore , state of the art phenomenological predictions for open charm and bottom , charmonium , and single top and top pair production have been discussed in addition to other topics such as the effect of double parton scattering on heavy quark production .",
    "a huge amount of measurements of heavy - quarkonium and of open charm and beauty production has been produced from hera , lhc , tevatron , and rhic .",
    "these measurements challenge the qcd predictions that are typically less precise than experimental data .",
    "the agreement between data and theory is in general good .",
    "some measurements , for which the agreement is marginal , deserve further studies : the polarization of heavy quarkonium , the measurement of jets associated to a @xmath75 presented by atlas , and the measurement of double charm production performed by lhcb .",
    "the top quark is being scrutinized with unparalleled precision at both the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "the d0 and cdf experiments are measuring the strong and electroweak production cross section as well as the top quark mass very precisely .",
    "new @xmath41 and @xmath109 states have been observed and exotic quarkonia extensively studied by @xmath36-factories as well as lhc and tevatron experiments .",

    "<S> recent theoretical progress includes approximate nnlo calculations for heavy quark structure functions in deep inelastic scattering , the extension of the acot heavy flavour scheme to jet production , and advances in top physics where the highlight is clearly the first complete nnlo qcd prediction for top pair production in the @xmath0 annihilation channel . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , state of the art phenomenological predictions for open charm and bottom , charmonium , and single top and top pair production are discussed in addition to other topics such as the effect of double parton scattering on heavy quark production . </S>",
    "<S> new measurements on charm and beauty production presented in the heavy flavor working group are summarized and discussed in comparison with qcd predictions . </S>",
    "<S> top quark strong and weak couplings as well as top quark properties are being measured with precision at the lhc and the tevatron . </S>",
    "<S> we summarize also recent results on spectroscopy of charmonia , bottomonia and @xmath1-hadrons , along with studies of their decays and properties . </S>",
    "<S> searches for physics beyond standard model through precise measurements of rare decays of heavy flavours are discussed as well . </S>"
