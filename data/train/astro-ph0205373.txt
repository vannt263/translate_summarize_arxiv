    "the classification scheme for sne is based on the presence or absence of hydrogen lines in their optical spectra ( type ii and type i , respectively ) . while type ii",
    "/ ib sne occur during the core collapse of a massive star , type ia sne are believed to originate from the deflagration or detonation of an accreting white dwarf star in a binary system .",
    "the massive ( @xmath6 ) progenitor stars for the controversial type ic sn subclass are thought to have lost their outer hydrogen and helium layers either through stellar winds or by mass transfer to a companion , leaving behind a stripped carbon and oxygen ( c+o ) star .",
    "such a ` naked ' c+o star will later explode when its iron core collapses ( e.g. nomoto et al .",
    "the interaction of the outgoing sn shock wave with the ambient csm , deposited either by a pre - sn stellar wind or non - conservative mass transfer to a companion , produces hot gas with characteristic temperatures in the range @xmath7@xmath8  k ( chevalier & fransson 1994 ) .",
    "gas heated to such high temperatures produces radiation predominantly in the x - ray range .",
    "x - ray emission from this interaction is expected for all type ib / c and ii sne with substantial csm established by the massive progenitors . over the last 20 years , searches for",
    "x - ray emitting sne have been successful for only a relatively small number of type ii s in the near aftermath ( days to months ) of the explosion ( see immler & lewin 2002 for a review article ) .    by contrast , no type ia or ib / c sn has ever been firmly detected in x - rays , apart from a @xmath9 excess in an  epic - pn image @xmath10 offset from the optical position of the ic sn  2002ap ( rodriguez - pascual et al .",
    "hard ( 210  kev band ) x - ray emission was recorded with  from the position of the unusual sn 1998bw , which might be associated with a @xmath11-ray burst event ( grb 980425 ; galama et al .",
    "1998 , pian et al . 1998 ) . due to the large error box of the  wide field camera observation ( between @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 confidence limit ) and the rather large probability of @xmath15",
    "that the source is a random chance coincidence , the association of the x - ray source with sn 1998bw and grb  980425 is still tentative ( galama et al . 1998 ) .",
    "evidence for soft ( 0.12.4  kev band ) x - ray emission has been reported from the type ic sn  1994i , based on  hri observations 82 days after the outburst ( immler , pietsch & aschenbach 1998 ) . however , the  observations , with a spatial resolution of @xmath16 ( fwhm on - axis ) , were not conclusive since sn  1994i is located close to the x - ray bright nucleus of the host galaxy m51 ( distance @xmath17 ) and is embedded in a high level of extended x - ray emission from hot gas and unresolved point - like x - ray sources in the bulge of m51 .",
    "we used the  x - ray observatory to search for x - ray emission from sn 1994i in x - ray images taken between six ( june 6 , 2000 ) and seven years ( june 23 , 2001 ) after the explosion ( march 31 , 1994 ; chandler , phillips & rupen 1994 ) .",
    "our 14.9  ks and 26.8  ks  observations were carried out with the s3 chip of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis - s ) at the focal plane of the telescope and the nucleus of the host galaxy m51 placed at the aim - point ( terashima & wilson 2001 ) .",
    "the superb spatial resolution ( @xmath18 fwhm on - axis ) , together with the high sensitivity of the instrument and the long combined exposure ( 41.7  ks ) , allows us to separate point - like sources from the diffuse emission in the bulge of m51 and to carry out a sensitive search for x - ray emission from sn  1994i .",
    "the co - added and adaptively smoothed  image of the central region of m51 is presented in fig .  1 .",
    "an x - ray source is detected at the position of sn  1994i in the merged  data with a significance of @xmath19 in the 0.32  kev band using the ` wave detect ' algorithm implemented in the ciao data analysis package .",
    "the position of the x - ray source ( @xmath20 ) is fully consistent with the radio position of the sn ( @xmath21 offset ; rupen et al .",
    "astrometry of the m51 nucleus shows a similarly small offset between the ( 28  kev band ) x - ray and radio positions ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "exposure corrected source counts were extracted within a radius of 3 image pixels ( 90% encircled energy radius at 1  kev ) and corrected for the background taken in an annulus with inner and outer radii of 3.5 and 9.5 pixels , respectively ( 1 pixel corresponds to @xmath23 ) .",
    "a spectral model has to be assumed to convert source counts into energy fluxes .",
    "we adopted an effective ( 0.32  kev band ) cooling function of @xmath24 for an optically thin raymond - smith thermal plasma with a temperature of @xmath25  k ( raymond , cox & smith 1976 ) .",
    "although the temperature is unknown , this value is consistent with theoretical expectations ( chevalier & fransson 1994 ) , previous x - ray observations of other sne and the detection of sn  1994i in the soft ( 0.32  kev ) x - ray band where the peak of a @xmath25  k spectrum is located . the equivalent count rate to ( unabsorbed ) flux conversion factors are then @xmath26 and @xmath27 for the  hri and  acis - s3 , respectively , and a galactic foreground column density of @xmath28 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "the uncertainty of the conversion factors for optically thin thermal spectra with temperatures in the range @xmath25@xmath8  k is @xmath29 . assuming a 0.86  kev thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum ( corresponding to a temperature of @xmath25  k ) instead of a raymond - smith thermal plasma increases the conversion factor by @xmath30 .",
    "the  results for the two individual observations of sn  1994i , together with previous  hri results ( immler , pietsch & aschenbach 1998 ) , are summarized in table  1 .",
    "we used the  and  data to construct a combined x - ray lightcurve of sn  1994i , which is presented in fig .  2",
    ". a best - fit single power - law rate of decline of @xmath31 with index @xmath32 ( solid line , fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) is inferred for the measurements on days 82 , 2,271 and 2,639 .",
    "assuming an initial exponential rise of the x - ray luminosity after the outburst ( at time @xmath33 ) of sn  1994i and a subsequent power - law decline with index @xmath34 , we also parameterized the x - ray evolution as @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "this model has been successfully used to describe the time dependence of the radio emission of sne ( weiler et al .",
    "the external absorption of the emission is represented by the @xmath37 term ( ` optical depth ' ) and the time - dependence of the optical depth is parameterized by the exponent @xmath38 . in the x - ray regime",
    ", the rise could represent either decreasing absorption by material along the line of sight to the hot gas or simply non - production of x - rays in the  band at early times .",
    "if we adopt this strictly heuristic description , we find @xmath3 and @xmath39 ( dashed line , fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) . in case",
    "the  detection on day 82 corresponds to a pre - maximum measurement , a steeper index of @xmath40 is inferred ( dotted line , fig .",
    "however , given the large error range of the flux measurements , @xmath34 and @xmath38 are not very well constrained . while a @xmath41 rate of decline has been observed for the type iib sn  1999em with  ( pooley et al .",
    "2002 ) , faster rates of decline have been reported for the ic sn 1998bw ( @xmath42 ) , inferred from the tentative hard ( 210  kev ) band  data ( pian et al .",
    "1999 ) , the ic radio sn  1990b ( @xmath43 ) and the ib radio sne 1983n ( @xmath44 ) and 1984l ( @xmath45 ; van dyk et al .",
    "by contrast , the long - term x - ray lightcurve of the iib sn  1993j is best described by a slow rate of decline with @xmath46 ( immler , aschenbach & wang 2001 ) .",
    "the x - ray emitting material could be either shocked sn ejecta ( reverse shock ) or shocked csm ( forward shock ; chevalier & fransson 1994 ) .",
    "the lack of time - dependent x - ray spectroscopy precludes a distinction but , as we shall see , the x - ray lightcurve is consistent with the latter model with a constant pre - sn mass loss rate ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "alternatively , the csm might result from a non - conservative mass - transfer to the companion star , leading to the formation of a flattened or disk - like h and he - rich shell ( nomoto et al .",
    "1994 ) . in this case a csm profile flatter than @xmath5 is expected due to the non - spherically symmetric geometry of the mass - transfer .    in the stellar wind scenario",
    "the continuum equation requires a mass - loss rate of @xmath47 through a sphere of radius @xmath48 .",
    "after the sn shock plows through the csm , its density is @xmath49 ( fransson , lundqvist & chevalier 1996 ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the shock - heated csm is @xmath50 , where d@xmath51 is the volume , @xmath52 is the number density of the shocked csm and @xmath53 is the mean mass per particle ( @xmath54  kg for a h+he plasma ) .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath55 . the observed x - ray rate of decline ( @xmath41 ) is consistent with this description if @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are constant .",
    "we can hence use the observed x - ray luminosity at time @xmath59 after the outburst to measure the ratio @xmath57 assuming a constant shell expansion velocity @xmath58 . given our observed x - ray luminosities ( table  1 ) and assuming a shell expansion velocity of @xmath60 ( filippenko et al .",
    "1995 ) we derive a mass - loss rate of @xmath61 consistent with all three detections and the  upper limit on day 1,368 .",
    "it should be noted , however , that a single power - law model can only be reconciled with the data obtained on days 822,639 , but not with the early  upper limit on day 52 ( see fig .",
    "this is indicative that the above model might be incomplete for early epochs .",
    "the addition of an exponential term describing the rise during the early phase of the emission leads to a fit that is in agreement with all measurements in case the  detection on day 82 was a post - maximum measurement ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "by contrast , the model with a steeper rate of decline ( @xmath40 ) , which postulates that the early  detection corresponds to a pre - maximum measurement , is in conflict with a @xmath5 profile .",
    "table  1 summarizes the csm number density @xmath62 for the different radii @xmath63 corresponding to the dates of the observations . as was already claimed based on the early  data ( immler , pietsch & aschenbach 1998 ) , the @xmath64 upper limit for the csm density at @xmath65 ( day 1,368 ) is lower than that at @xmath66 ( day 82 ) .",
    "our  results at @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( days 2,271 and 2,639 , respectively ) clearly support these early indications for a decreasing csm density profile ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the combined  and  data of sn 1994i give a best - fit profile of @xmath4 .",
    "the only sn for which a csm density profile has been constructed from x - ray measurements is sn  1993j ( type iib with a progenitor of @xmath69 ) , based on long - term monitoring with   between six days and five years after the outburst ( immler , aschenbach & wang 2001 ) . a comparison between the csm profiles of the two sne is presented in fig .",
    "although the csm density profile of sn  1993j is significantly flatter ( @xmath70 ) than that of sn  1994i , the two sne have a similar csm number density of @xmath71 at a radius of @xmath72 from the site of the explosion ( cf .",
    "fig .  3 ) .    given that both the x - ray rate of decline ( @xmath73 ) and the csm profile ( @xmath4 ) of sn  1994i are not in conflict with what is expected for a constant stellar wind speed and a constant mass - loss rate of the progenitor ( @xmath73 , @xmath5 ) , it is likely that the stellar wind of the massive progenitor dominates the csm .",
