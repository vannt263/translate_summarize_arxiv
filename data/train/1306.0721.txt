    "ultrafast spectroscopy with a time resolution as high as @xmath0s is essential for understanding many quantum dynamical processes in chemical physics.@xcite although short time scales should simplify theoretical studies by requiring shorter simulations , solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) is challenging even for short times due to the exponential scaling with the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "an attractive approach offering a compromise between accuracy and computational efficiency is provided by the semiclassical initial value representation methods , miller:1970,heller:1981,herman_kluk:1984,miller:2001,herman:1994,*thoss_wang:2004,*kay:2005,*ceotto_zhuang:2013 which benefit from the ultrafast character of the dynamics not only because of lower computational cost , but also because their accuracy deteriorates with increasing time .",
    "the so - called dephasing representation@xcite ( dr ) , is an efficient initial - value - type semiclassical approximation particularly fitted for calculations of time - resolved electronic spectra.@xcite the dr improves on a previous method@xcite inspired by the semiclassical perturbation theory of miller and coworkers.@xcite in electronic spectroscopy , the dr and closely related approximations are known as mukamel s phase averaging method@xcite or wigner - averaged classical limit , and were used by various authors.shemetulskis_loring:1992,rost:1995,wang_sun:1998,li_fang:1996,*egorov_rabani:1998,*egorov_rabani:1999,shi_geva:2005 shi and geva@xcite derived this approximation without invoking the semiclassical propagator  by linearizingpoulsen_nyman:2003,bonella_coker:2005 the path integral quantum propagator .",
    "although the original formulation of the dr pertains to a single pair of potential energy surfaces , the generalization to multiple surfaces , and hence to nonadiabatic dynamics , exists.zimmermann_vanicek:2012,*zimmermann_vanicek:2012a the dr has many other applications ; the method successfully described , e.g. , the local density of states and the transition from the fermi - golden - rule to the lyapunov regime of fidelity decay.wang_casati:2005,*ares_wisniacki:2009,*wisniacki_ares:2010,*garcia-mata_wisniacki:2011    yet the most attractive feature of the dr is its efficiency : motivated by numerical comparisons with other semiclassical methods , wehrle_sulc:2011 it has been recently proved analyticallymollica_vanicek:2011 that the number of trajectories required for convergence of the dr is independent of the system s dimensionality , hamiltonian , or total evolution time .",
    "the efficiency was further increased in the cellular version of the dr,@xcite which was inspired by heller s cellular dynamics@xcite and which can significantly reduce the required number of trajectories . the original implementation of the _ cellular dr _ ( cdr ) , however , does not converge to the dr in the limit of infinite number of trajectories .    unlike its efficiency , the accuracy of the dr is not always sufficient .",
    "the dr is exact in displaced harmonic oscillatorsmukamel:1982,*book_mukamel and often accurate in chaotic systems , vanicek:2004,*vanicek:2006 but it breaks down in as simple systems as harmonic oscillators with different force constants .",
    "this breakdown can be partially remedied by augmenting the dr with a  prefactor , zambrano_almeida:2011 which , however , leads to a  much higher computational cost per trajectory and also typically requires more trajectories to achieve convergence .",
    "the first goal of the present paper is to describe a general numerical implementation of the prefactor correction and apply it to the calculation of time - resolved electronic spectra .",
    "as the numerical evaluation of the cdr requires , incidentally , the same ingredients as the prefactor correction , the second goal is to combine the advantages of the cellular approach and prefactor correction into a single formula , and show that the resulting method , _ cellular dr with prefactor _ ( cdrp ) , is able to increase both the efficiency and accuracy of the dr .",
    "our third goal is presenting a major improvement of the cellularization process by employing the inverse weierstrass transform of the initial state as the optimal sampling weight instead of the widely used wigner or husimi functions , and by correlating the size of the cells with their number and the number of degrees of freedom , which guarantees the convergence of the cdr to the original dr in the limit of infinite number of trajectories .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : the correlation function approach and the dr approximation for evaluating time - resolved stimulated emission spectra is reviewed in section [ sec : theory ] ; in particular , the dr , its prefactor correction , and its cellular version are deduced . after explaining how the new cellular approach provides optimal choices of the sampling weight and width of gaussian cells , we derive the cdrp , i.e. , a method combining the prefactor correction and cellularization into a single framework .",
    "section [ sec : examples ] contains several analytical and numerical results testing the theory developed in section [ sec : theory ] , while section [ sec : final_remarks ] provides conclusions .",

    "<S> time - resolved electronic spectra can be obtained as the fourier transform of a special type of time correlation function known as fidelity amplitude , which , in turn , can be evaluated approximately and efficiently with the dephasing representation . here </S>",
    "<S> we improve both the accuracy of this approximation  with an amplitude correction derived from the phase - space propagator  and its efficiency  with an improved cellular scheme employing inverse weierstrass transform and optimal scaling of the cell size . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the advantages of the new methodology by computing dispersed time - resolved stimulated emission spectra in the harmonic potential , pyrazine , and the nco molecule . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , we show that in strongly chaotic systems such as the quartic oscillator the original dephasing representation is more appropriate than either the cellular or prefactor - corrected methods . </S>"
