    "a number of experimental observations in the last two decades have begged for an understanding of interacting quantum systems that goes beyond the simple weakly interacting quasi - particle paradigm of solid - state physics .",
    "the large number of such systems with anomalous properties include as examples , cuprate superconductors , quantum critical heavy - fermion metals  @xcite , mott - insulating organic materials  @xcite and insulating frustrated magnets  @xcite .",
    "a new paradigm that has been invoked to describe these systems is quantum number fractionalization , see for e.g. ref .  .",
    "re - writing the original constituents in terms of fractional particles interacting with a gauge field , unconventional phases ( or transitions ) are accessed by the deconfined phases of these gauge theories .",
    "these deconfined phases can not find a consistent description in terms of quasi - particles that are compositionally related to the particles of the microscopic description , and hence provide a new paradigm that dramatically departs from the conventional confines of solid - state physics .",
    "an important issue that arises immediately is the detection of such exotic quantum phases or phase transition in experiments or numerical simulations . in most cases",
    "the appearance of these exotic field theories is also signaled by dramatic qualitative physical effects , e.g. a direct continuous transition between quantum states that break distinct symmetries  @xcite ( such a transition would not be permitted in the conventional landau theory ) . while these novel physical effects themselves signal the appearance of the deconfined field theory , it is desirable to have a direct understanding and numerical estimate for universal quantities associated with the continuum field theories .",
    "an estimate for the universal numbers and scaling functions allows for a quantitative comparison between experiment / simulations and theory , and could be helpful for instance to distinguish between a non - universal weak first - order transition and a universal continuous one , in finite - size numerical computations  @xcite .    the starting point of our analysis will be a relativistic continuum field theory of @xmath2 flavors of charged fermions and @xmath1 flavors of charged bosons mutually interacting through a gauge field in two spatial dimensions .",
    "this continuum description makes no reference to the variety of microscopic lattice models that may realize the quantum field theory .",
    "examples of the derivations of relativistic field theoretic descriptions starting from lattice models of spins or electrons in different contexts may be found in refs .  .",
    "we postpone a discussion of the application of our results to these physical realizations to section  [ sec : conc ] .    we shall be interested in the general case of interacting field theories that involve bosons ( @xmath4 ) , dirac fermions ( @xmath5 ) and gauge fields ( @xmath6 ) . working in imaginary time the partition function of these theories",

    "@xmath10 the constraint @xmath11 must be satisfied at all points in time and space .",
    "the action @xmath12 by itself is the well - known @xmath13 model .",

    "indeed , the ` deconfined ' theory of the nel - vbs transition is described by @xmath12 at @xmath15 , and @xmath16 plays the role of the nel order parameter where @xmath17 are the generators of su(2 ) , a physical quantity that must be gauge independent .",
    "some large-@xmath1 computations on this model are available in the literature  @xcite .",

    "in general , a maxwellian term for the @xmath6 : @xmath24 should also be included .",
    "we note however that this term will not play an important role in our considerations : as we will show below , the contribution to the @xmath6 propagator from the interaction with @xmath4 and @xmath5 at large-@xmath25 , decays with a slow power at long distances and hence dominate the contribution from @xmath26 at large length scales . as is usual in quantum field theory , we introduce a finite-@xmath27 by restricting the imaginary time integrals in the actions above to extend from @xmath28 to @xmath29 . the @xmath4 and @xmath6 must then satisfy periodic and the @xmath5 anti - periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we note here that the action @xmath30 , when considered separately is always quantum critical , i.e. there are no relevant perturbations consistent with its symmetry .",
    "this is in contrast to @xmath31 which goes critical only at a single value of the coupling @xmath32 , _ i.e. _ the boson mass is a relevant perturbation at the phase transition between the higgs ( @xmath33 ) and the deconfined coulomb phase ( @xmath34 ) .",
