    "in recent years , observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation fluctuations by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) and a large number of ground - based and suborbital experiments have led to a precise measurement of the temperature anisotropy power spectrum up to multipoles of a few thousand ( @xcite ) .",
    "apart from some claimed `` anomalies '' ( see below ) the observations are consistent with a dark - energy - dominated cosmology with statistically isotropic , gaussian , adiabatic perturbations , as expected from simple models of inflation .",
    "( we will refer to this as the `` concordance '' @xmath6cdm model . )",
    "if statistical isotropy applies , then the harmonic coefficients of the temperature field , @xmath7must satisfy @xmath8 if the fluctuations are gaussian and statistically isotropic , their statistical properties are completely described by the power spectrum @xmath9 .    there have been some hints of `` anomalies '' in the wmap data , perhaps suggesting a violation of statistical isotropy . these include alignments of low-@xmath10 multipoles @xcite , evidence for power asymmetry @xcite and for a deep cold spot in the southern galactic hemisphere @xcite .",
    "for the most part , these anomalies have been found by examining the data without reference to specific theoretical models .",
    "there is , therefore , an _ a posteriori _ aspect in computing their statistical significance which is difficult to assess @xcite . some authors have , however , claimed highly significant discrepancies between the cmb data and the concordance @xmath6cdm model @xcite .",
    "interest in the cmb anomalies has motivated theorists to build inflationary models that violate rotational invariance , either via the addition of a vector field @xcite or via an isocurvature perturbation @xcite .",
    "in addition , a number of phenomenological models that violate statistical isotropy have been proposed , which can be tested against observations ( e.g. gordon05 , dvorkin07 , ackerman07 ) .",
    "reference  @xcite considers the phenomenological model in which the primordial power spectrum depends on a preferred direction , @xmath11 ,   \\label{acw}\\]]where @xmath12 is some arbitrary function of wavenumber .",
    "there has been considerable interest in this model recently .",
    "the authors of groeneboom08 applied gibbs sampling to the wmap five - year maps to test models with @xmath13 , finding strong evidence for a preferred direction with @xmath14 using multipoles @xmath15 .",
    "hanson and lewis @xcite corrected some algebraic errors in the analysis of @xcite and applied a simpler quadratic estimator to the wmap 5-year data .",
    "these authors also found evidence for a highly significant ( @xmath16 ) departure from statistical isotropy , but with a preferred direction suspiciously close to the ecliptic poles , suggestive of some type of systematic effect in the wmap data .",
    "this analysis was confirmed by @xcite .",
    "a subsequent analysis @xcite showed that asymmetries in the wmap beams fully account for the observed violation of statistical isotropy .    despite this negative conclusion ,",
    "it is still important to assess the prospects of constraining violations of statistical isotropy in the cmb with more precise experiments . in this paper , we focus on constraints from the planck satellite , which was launched successfully in may 2009 and has recently completed its third full scan of the sky .",
    "the planck satellite has much higher signal - to - noise ratio in both temperature and polarization than wmap @xcite .",
    "it also has higher angular resolution  5 arcmin full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) at frequencies @xmath17  so asymmetries on scales of the beam width should have little effect at multipoles @xmath18 .",
    "it is also expected that the planck beams will be calibrated to high precision from scans of bright planets @xcite . following the successful launch of planck , the european space agency ( esa )",
    "has approved a mission extension until the on - board cryogens are depleted .",
    "planck is therefore expected to produce almost five sky surveys , compared to the two sky surveys approved for the nominal mission .",
    "this combination of high sensitivity , high resolution and extended lifetime allows greater scope for testing for systematic effects than was possible with wmap .",
    "for example , it becomes possible to use polarization maps independently of temperature maps to test for violations of statistical isotropy .    in this paper , we extend the analysis of @xcite to assess how accurately an extended planck mission can be used to test models with an anisotropic primordial power spectrum .",
