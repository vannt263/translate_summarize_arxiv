    "although the discovery of `` a higgs - like boson '' at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has been a refreshing development  @xcite , there is no clear signal yet for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "it is therefore natural that physicists are trying to wring the last drop out of the higgs sector itself , in attempts to read fingerprints of new physics .",
    "one approach is to examine all available data in terms of specific new models , such as supersymmetry or just additional higgs doublets . in the other approach",
    ", one can take a model - independent stance , parametrize possible modifications of the interaction terms of the higgs with pairs of sm particles , and examine them in the light of the available data . such modifications can again be of two types . in the first category , they are just multiplicative modifications of the coupling strengths , the lorentz structures remaining the same as in the sm",
    ". constraints on such modifications have already been derived from the available higgs data  @xcite . in the second class ,",
    "one considers additional operators with new lorentz structures satisfying all symmetries of the sm  @xcite .",
    "gauge invariance of such operators in their original forms may be expected , since they are obtained by integrating out new physics that is just above the reach of the present round of experiments .",
    "sets of such higher - dimensional operators contributing to the effective coupling of the higgs to , say a pair of electroweak vector bosons have been studied extensively .",
    "here it makes sense to include only @xmath4 invariant operators in one s list to start with , because the yet unknown new physics lies at least a little above the electroweak symmetry breaking scale .",
    "a host of such gauge invariant higher - dimensional operators have been , and are being , analyzed with considerable rigor , and now there exist limits on them , using data ranging from electroweak precision measurements to global fits of lhc results  @xcite .",
    "most of such analyses include higher - dimensional operators that conserve charge conjugation ( c ) , parity ( p ) and time - reversal ( t ) . however , there is evidence of c , p and cp - violation in weak interactions  @xcite , and there are speculations about other sources of cp - violation as well , especially with a view to explaining the baryon asymmetry in our universe  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of cp - nonconservation can not therefore be ruled out in the new physics currently sought after .",
    "thus one may in principle also obtain higher - dimensional interaction terms involving the higgs and a pair of gauge bosons .",
    "the constraints on such terms , and identification of regions in the parameter space where they can be phenomenologically significant , form the subject - matter of the present paper .",
    "the cp - violating effective couplings , interestingly , are not constrained by the oblique electroweak parameters at one - loop level up to @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the cutoff scale of the effective theory .",
    "the leading contributions to self - energy corrections to electroweak gauge bosons at one - loop level occur at @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , electroweak precision ( ewp ) data are not expected to provide severe constraints on cp - odd parameters .",
    "in addition to this , higgs - mediated event rates in various channels receive contributions from these couplings at @xmath7 .",
    "thus they can also be constrained from global fits of the lhc data .",
    "the strongest limits on them , however , arise from the contributions to the electric dipole moments ( edms ) of the neutron and the electron , both of which are severely restricted from experiments .",
    "as we shall see in the following sections , a single cp - violating operator taken at a time may in certain cases be limited to a very small strength from the above constraints , while two or three such operators considered together can have relatively larger , but highly correlated coefficients . some of these operators can have interesting phenomenological implications , especially in the context of the lhc .",
    "a study in similar lines can be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "however , we have performed the most comprehensive analysis , taking all the five possible dimension-6 cp - violating @xmath1 operators ( @xmath8 ) , which are not yet discussed thoroughly in the literature . we provide the constraints obtained from the oblique electroweak parameters .",
    "the constraints coming from global fits of lhc data and electric dipole moments , for two and three operators taken at a time , have been compared .",
    "in addition to these we also provide the constraints on trilinear gauge boson couplings coming from lep data on gauge boson pair production .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we provide details on the cp - violating gauge higgs operators and derive feynman rules for three point vertices of our interest .",
    "in section 3 we present the constraints on cp - violating parameters coming from the precision electroweak measurements . following this ,",
    "we perform a global analysis of these parameters using lhc data on higgs in section 4 and we discuss edm constraints on cp - violating parameters in section 5 .",
    "section 6 is devoted to discussion of results .",
    "finally we summarize and conclude in section 7 .",
    "in the effective lagrangian approach that has been followed here , one can write a lagrangian ( @xmath9 ) comprising only of the sm fields , where the effects of the new physics that appear above the cutoff scale @xmath6 are encapsulated in higher dimensional gauge invariant operators . in general , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the mass dimension of the operator @xmath12 and the dimensionless free parameter @xmath13 fixes the strength of the corresponding operator .",
    "the operators constructed out of the higgs doublet and the @xmath14 gauge fields are of even dimensions , and at the leading order they have mass dimension @xmath15 .",
    "the dimension six cp - even gauge invariant operators constructed out of the higgs doublet ( @xmath16 ) and the electroweak gauge fields ( @xmath17 ) , that modify the gauge - higgs couplings are given as follows : @xmath18[eq : o - cp - even ] in the above , we have defined @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 are the electroweak coupling parameters corresponding to @xmath23 and @xmath24 gauge groups respectively , and @xmath25 are the three pauli matrices .",
    "we define the gauge covariant derivative as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the hypercharge quantum number . with this choice of the definition of gauge covariant derivative ,",
    "field strength tensor @xmath28 is given by , @xmath29 .",
    "the constraints on cp - even parameters and their collider implications have been studied extensively in the literature  @xcite . in this work",
    "we are interested in corresponding cp - violating dimension six gauge - higgs operators .",
    "these are , @xmath30[eq : o - cp - odd ] where , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 being the four - dimensional fully antisymmetric tensor with @xmath34 .    in principle , the cp - even operators [ eq.([eq : o - cp - even ] ) ] could have been assumed to exist simultaneously with the cp - odd ones considered here .",
    "however , such an approach generates far too large a set of free parameters , where the signature of the cp - violating effective couplings would be drowned .",
    "moreover , the cp - even operators are independent of the cp - odd ones ( and vice versa ) ; therefore , setting them to zero is a viable phenomenological approach .",
    "we therefore postulate that the new physics above scale @xmath6 is such that _ only cp - violating dimension six effective operators are appreciable _ , and the corresponding cp - conserving ones are much smaller .",
    "such a `` simplified approach , '' we reiterate , is unavoidable for unveiling cp - violating high scale physics , as has been recognized in the literature  @xcite .",
    "studies focusing exclusively on the generation of cp - violating terms in specific new physics frameworks can also be found , an example being those in the context of extra space - time dimensions  @xcite .",
    ".cp - odd @xmath1 and @xmath35 coupling factors and their effective strengths . [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we have already seen that the lorentz structure of anomalous cp - odd couplings is unique and these are just some linear combinations of the cp - odd parameters ( see table  [ tab : anomalous_vertices ] ) . since in all the observables these couplings enter directly , it is instructive to know the kind of values these couplings can take as a result of our analysis presented above . in the calculation of @xmath36 and @xmath37",
    "parameters all the cp - odd couplings directly enter . in the global analysis",
    "only @xmath38 couplings participate , therefore , constraints on @xmath39 from the lhc data are indirect . in edm calculations only @xmath40 and @xmath41 enter directly and therefore limits obtained on @xmath42 and @xmath43 are also indirect .",
    "the limits on the strengths of the anomalous couplings are listed in table [ tab : coupling strengths ] . since electroweak precision bounds on @xmath44 are the weakest   from ewp and lhc data are comparable in 2p case . ] , in the table we compare bounds on couplings due to lhc data and edms .",
    "the comparison is presented for both the two parameter ( 2p ) and three parameter ( 3p ) nonzero cases .",
    "since @xmath45 is proportional to @xmath41 , the limits on @xmath41 can be easily translated to limits on @xmath45 .",
    "looking at the lhc limits on the couplings we find that @xmath46 is the most constrained coupling . also , the lhc limits in 2p and 3p cases are comparable . on the other hand the edm limits on couplings in 2p case",
    "is always stronger than in 3p case . in 3p case",
    "the lower limits result from the three parameter sets @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the parameters of these sets are found to be very fine tuned .",
    "it is important to recall that in 3p edm case , the parameters are varied in the range between -200 to 200 . we find that as we increase this range , the maximum allowed values for couplings also increase .",
    "we would also like to point out that the correlations among cp - odd couplings are mostly similar to those found among cp - odd parameters .",
    "the triple gauge boson couplings ( tgcs ) @xmath49 and @xmath50 can also be constrained using the collider data on gauge boson pair production . data from tevatron and lhc are used mainly to constrain the cp - even anomalous couplings as the observables used are not sensitive to cp - odd couplings  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the experimental analyses at lep which studied the angular distribution of final state particles are sensitive to cp - odd tgcs .",
    "a comparison between the cp - odd sector of tgc lagrangian  @xcite and our effective lagrangian ( eq .  [ eq : l - bsm ] ) implies @xmath51 using the relation between @xmath41 and @xmath45 we get , @xmath52 . at 68% cl , the combined lep limits on @xmath53",
    "are  @xcite @xmath54 these limits when translated on @xmath45 and @xmath41 become , @xmath55 \\le -0.08 , { \\nonumber}\\\\   0.15   & \\le & \\frac{c_{ww\\gamma}}{\\lambda^2}~[{\\rm tev}^{-2 } ] \\le 0.36.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that these limits are comparable to the limits obtained from edms in 2p case , however , information on the sign of the couplings is also available .",
    "+   other than the @xmath1 vertices considered in our analysis , quartic @xmath56 vertices also arise out of gauge invariant cp violating operators .",
    "one can thus expect some correlated phenomenology from the trilinear and quartic interactions , since the former arise essentially on replacing one higgs by its vacuum expectation value in the quartic terms . in the analysis presented in this work , the production and decay channels considered are not affected at tree level by such quartic @xmath56 vertices .",
    "thus in the context of the present analysis , any constraints on such quartic vertices from observed data are likely to be weaker than those obtained from the @xmath57 effective interactions , since the quartic couplings would entail higgs pair production .",
    "for example , the @xmath56 vertex may contribute in addition to the @xmath58 vertex toward a di - higgs final state .",
    "however , one needs to wait for a large volume of data on higgs pair production to see such correlated phenomena . in general , limits stronger than what we have obtained are not expected .",
    "also , the contributions from such @xmath56 cp - odd vertices to edms and ewp observables come at higher loop levels and thus are expected to be substantially weaker than what we have obtained for the trilinear terms .",
    "it is a well - known fact that the observed baryon asymmetry in our universe can not be explained by just the cp - violating phase of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix in the sm .",
    "the presence of additional sources of cp - violating operators arising from the anomalous @xmath1 interactions may in principle explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "however , a more careful scrutiny of this picture reveals that our cp - violating operators are not sufficient to trigger strongly the first order electroweak phase transition required for the baryogenesis . for this",
    ", one has to extend the higgs sector of the sm by introducing new particles which couple to the higgs boson and thus modify the higgs potential such that it leads to a strongly first order electroweak phase transition @xcite .",
    "we have analyzed cp - odd @xmath59 and @xmath60 interactions in terms of gauge invariant dimension-6 operators , obtained as the artifacts of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the most complete set , comprising five gauge - higgs operators , has been taken into account .",
    "we have derived constraints on the coefficients of such operators using electroweak precision data , lhc data on higgs and limits on the electric dipole moments of the neutron and the electron . with @xmath6 as the scale suppressing the cp - violating operators , precision parameters as well as lhc observables receive contributions @xmath61 from the cp - odd couplings , while contributions @xmath62 to edm observables are expected .",
    "the constraints obtained from the @xmath63 and @xmath37 parameters are the weakest , while the bounds from edms are the strongest with two nonvanishing operators .",
    "the global analysis of higgs data from the lhc puts stronger constraints on those cp - odd effective couplings which contribute to @xmath64 , as compared to those which do not .",
    "we also indicate situations where large values of certain couplings are allowed by all constraints , when they appear in combination .",
    "the constraints coming from lep on cp - odd form factors @xmath41 and @xmath45 are consistent with our limits obtained from edms in the case when any two out of five parameters are nonzero .",
    "it may be of interest to find out new physics scenarios where , by integrating out heavy degrees of freedom , one may arrive at large correlated values of such operators . in a subsequent work ,",
