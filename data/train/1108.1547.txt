    "the 4d ( non-)abelian 1-form gauge theories are at the heart of standard model ( sm ) of particle physics where there is a stunning degree of agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "one of the weak links of sm is connected with the very existence of the esoteric higgs particle which is responsible for the mass generation of gauge bosons and fermions . in view of the fact that higgs particle has not yet been observed experimentally with a hundred percent certainty ,",
    "other theoretical tools for the mass generation of gauge bosons ( in various dimensions of spacetime ) have become important and they have generated a renewed interest in the realm of theoretical physics .    in the context of the above",
    ", it may be mentioned that the 4d topologically massive ( non-)abelian gauge theories have been studied in the past [ 1 - 4 ] where there is merging and mixing of 1-form and 2-form ( non-)abelian gauge fields through the celebrated topological @xmath4 term . in such models",
    ", it has been shown that the ( non-)abelian 1-form gauge field acquires a mass in a very natural fashion without taking any recourse to the higgs mechanism .",
    "however , these models suffer from problems connected with renormalizability , consistency and unitarity .",
    "we have studied [ 5 - 10 ] these models , within the framework of superfield and becchi - rouet - stora - tyutin ( brst ) formalisms in the hope that we would be able to propose a model that would be free of the drawbacks of the earlier models [ 1 - 4 ] .",
    "however , it remains still an open problem to construct a 4d consistent , unitary and renormalizable non - abelian 2-form gauge theory ( where the 1-form and 2-form non - abelian gauge fields are incorporated together ) .    in the above scenario ,",
    "it is an interesting idea to propose and study some lower dimensional models which are free of the problems of 4d topologically massive theory and where mass and gauge - invariance co - exist together .",
    "one such _ massive _ model , that has been a topic of theoretical interest , is the jackiw - pi ( jp ) model in three ( 2 + 1)-dimensions of spacetime where the non - abelian gauge invariance and parity are respected together due to the introduction of a 1-form vector field , endowed with a parity , that is opposite of the usual non - abelian 1-form vector field [ 11 ] .",
    "in fact , the 3d gauge theories , in general , have been topic of theoretical research in the recent past because of the novel and attractive properties associated with them [ 12,13 ] .",
    "furthermore , it has already been shown that , for sufficiently strong vector coupling , the gauge invariance does _ not _ necessarily imply the _ masslessness _ of gauge particles [ 14,15 ] .    in the backdrop of the above statements ,",
    "the jp model of 3d massive gauge theory has been studied from different theoretical angles .",
    "for instance , the hamiltonian formulation and its constraint analysis have been carried out in [ 16 ] .",
    "the jp model is also endowed with some interesting continuous symmetries . in this",
    "context , mention can be made of the usual yang - mills ( ym ) symmetry transformation and a symmetry that is different ( i.e. nym ) from the ym .",
    "the brst symmetry and corresponding slavnov - taylor identity of this model have also been recently found [ 17 ] .",
    "however , the off - shell nilpotent and absolutely anticommuting anti - brst symmetry transformations of this model have not been discussed [ 17 ] which are essential for the completeness of the theory as their very existence is theoretically backed , guided and governed by the concept of mathematical objects called gerbes ( see , e.g. [ 18,19 ] for details ) .",
    "the local and continuous gauge symmetry , generated by the first - class constraints of a given gauge theory , is generalized to the nilpotent brst and anti - brst symmetry transformations in the brst formalism .",
    "the anti - brst symmetry is a new kind of symmetry transformation [ 20 ] that is satisfied by the yang - mills theory .",
    "it has also been shown [ 21 ] that the anti - brst symmetry has not been a matter of choice rather it has real fundamental importance in providing necessary additional conditions for the ghost freedom that is essential for a consistent quantization .",
    "both the nilpotent symmetries have been formulated in a completely model independent way in [ 22 ] . in our recent works [ 18,19 ] , we have demonstrated the relevance of gerbes in the context of brst formalism through the existence of cf - type restrictions .",
    "we have claimed that the latter is the hallmark of a gauge theory within the framework of brst formalism .",
    "thus , for the sake of completeness of the brst analysis of the jp model , it is essential to derive a proper anti - brst symmetry corresponding to the brst symmetry of [ 17 ] .    the main motivation behind our present investigation is to derive the full set of proper [ i.e. off - shell nilpotent ( @xmath5 ) and absolutely anticommuting ( @xmath1 ) ] ( anti-)brst symmetry transformations @xmath2 corresponding to the usual ym gauge symmetry transformation for the jp model by exploiting the  augmented \" superfield approach to brst formalism [ 23 - 27 ] .",
    "this geometrical approach leads to the derivation of ( anti-)brst invariant curci - ferrari ( cf ) condition [ 28 ] which ensures the absolute anticommutativity of @xmath2 and derivation of the coupled ( but equivalent ) lagrangian densities that respect the above ( anti-)brst symmetry transformations .    in our present endeavor ,",
    "we have purposely concentrated _ only _ on the usual ym gauge symmetries for the brst analysis within the framework of superfield formalism .",
    "this is due to the fact that we plan to understand the jp model step - by - step so that we can gain deep insights into the key aspects of this model .",
    "this understanding , perhaps , would enable us to propose an accurate model for the 4d theory and would make us confident about the limiting cases of the general brst analysis of this model where ym and nym gauge symmetries would be combined together for their thorough discussions ( within the framework of superfield formalism ) .",
    "exactly similar kind of programme , we have followed for the brst analysis of the 4d dynamical non - abelian gauge theory [ 3,2 ] within the framework of superfield approach ( see , e.g. [ 10 ] for details ) .",
    "the prime factors that are responsible for our present investigations are as follows .",
    "first , the jp model is free of the problems encountered in the 4d topologically massive models with @xmath4 term .",
    "second , this 3d model does not invoke any higher form gauge field ( like the 2-form @xmath6 field of 4d theory ) for the mass generation .",
    "third , the understanding of this 3d theory might provide some insights that would show the correct path to construct a renormalizable and consistent 4d massive theory .",
    "fourth , we study jp model within the framework of brst formalism where the renormalizability and unitarity could be proven with the help of slavnov - taylor identities and _ nilpotency _ of the _ conserved _ brst charge .",
    "finally , the 3d jp model is very special model because it generates mass for the gauge field without violating the parity symmetry .",
    "this feature is drastically different from the mass generation by incorporating the chern - simons term in the lagrangian density of 3d gauge theory where parity is violated .",
    "the contents of our present investigation are organized as follows . in section 2 , we discuss two sets of local gauge symmetry transformations associated with the jp model .",
    "our section 3 incorporates the derivation of ( anti-)brst symmetry transformations for the gauge field ( @xmath7 ) and ( anti-)ghost fields [ @xmath8 with the help of bonora - tonin s superfield formalism [ 23,24 ] . in section 4",
    ", we deal with the derivation of ( anti-)brst symmetry transformations for the vector field @xmath9 and scalar field @xmath3 within the framework of  augmented \" superfield formalism [ 25 - 27 ] .",
    "our section 5 is fully devoted to the derivation of coupled lagrangian densities that respect the above ( anti-)brst transformations .",
    "we show the conservation of ( anti-)brst current ( and corresponding charges ) in section 6 .",
    "our section 7 contains the discussion of ghost symmetry transformations and the derivation of the algebra satisfied by _ all _ the symmetry generators .",
    "finally , we made a few concluding remarks in section 8 .    in our appendix",
    "a , we capture the off - shell nilpotency and anticommutativity of the ( anti-)brst charges and the brst invariance ( as well as equivalence ) of the coupled lagrangian densities within the framework of `` augmented '' superfield formalism .",
    "we provide a geometrical interpretation for the existence of the ( anti-)brst invariant cf restriction [ 28 ] in our appendix b with a few clear and cogent physical arguments .",

    "the structure constants @xmath20 are chosen to be totally antisymmetric in @xmath21 for the semi -",

    "we begin with the lagrangian density of the three ( 2 + 1)-dimensional ( 3d ) _ massive _ non - abelian 1-form gauge theory proposed by jp where the @xmath16 yang - mills ( ym ) gauge invariance and parity are respected _",
    "together_. furthermore , this theory respects a non - yang - mills gauge symmetry transformation as well .",
    "the lagrangian density of the theory , in its full blaze of glory , is ( see , e.g. [ 11 ] ) @xmath22 where @xmath7 and @xmath9 are the vector fields with opposite parity , @xmath3 is a scalar field , @xmath23 is a coupling constant and @xmath24 is the mass parameter .",
    "the 2-form [ @xmath25 curvature tensor @xmath26 , corresponding to the 1-form @xmath27 field @xmath7 , is derived from the maurer - cartan equation @xmath28 .",
    "similarly , the field strength tensor @xmath29 , corresponding to the 1-form @xmath30 field @xmath9 , is obtained from @xmath31 \\equiv \\frac { 1}{2 ! } ( dx^\\mu \\wedge dx^\\nu)\\ , g_{\\mu\\nu } \\cdot t$ ] where the covariant derivative is defined as : @xmath32 .",
    "the above lagrangian density ( 1 ) respects the following usual local , continuous and infinitesimal yang - mills ( ym ) gauge transformations @xmath33 , as @xmath34 this theory also respects a non - yang - mills ( nym ) gauge transformation @xmath35 .",
    "the infinitesimal version of this transformation is : @xmath36 in the above , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the @xmath16 valued infinitesimal ( lorentz - scalar ) gauge parameters .",
    "it is straightforward to check that the lagrangian density ( 1 ) transforms , under the local , continuous and infinitesimal transformations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , as @xmath39.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we note that the usual ym symmetry is a perfect symmetry for @xmath40 because we have perfect invariance ( i.e. @xmath41 ) .",
    "however , the lagrangian density @xmath40 remains quasi - invariant under @xmath35 because it transforms to a total spacetime derivative .    in our present investigation",
    ", we shall concentrate only on the _ usual _ ym gauge symmetry transformations @xmath42 and derive the corresponding ( anti-)brst symmetry transformations that are off - shell nilpotent and absolutely anticommuting in nature .",
    "we apply the well - known bonora - tonin s superfield approach [ 23,24 ] to derive the nilpotent ( anti-)brst symmetry transformations corresponding to the ym gauge transformations ( @xmath33 ) for the 1-form gauge field @xmath7 and ( anti-)ghost fields @xmath43 . in this approach ,",
    "first of all , we generalize the 3d bosonic vector field @xmath44 and fermionic ( anti-)ghost fields @xmath45 to their corresponding superfields .",
    "the latter are defined on the @xmath46-dimensional supermanifold parametrized by the superspace variables @xmath47 where @xmath48 are the spacetime variables and @xmath49 are a pair of grassmannian variables ( with @xmath50 ) .",

    "these secondary fields can be determined in terms of the basic and auxiliary fields of the 3d local brst invariant quantum field theory through the application of the celebrated horizontality condition ( hc ) .",
    "we note that the kinetic term @xmath57 , corresponding to the 1-form gauge field @xmath7 , remains invariant under the gauge transformations ( 2 ) .",
    "the hc condition implies that the gauge invariant kinetic term remains invariant when we generalize the 3d ordinary non - abelian gauge theory onto ( 3 , 2)-dimensional supermanifold .",
    "the above statement of the gauge invariance can be , mathematically , expressed as : @xmath58 where the super curvature @xmath59 , defined on the @xmath46-dimensional supermanifold , is derived from the maurer - cartan equation : @xmath60 . here",
    "@xmath61 is the super exterior derivative ( with @xmath62 ) and @xmath63 is the super 1-form connection which are the generalizations of the ordinary exterior derivative @xmath64 and 1-form connection @xmath65 as @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the superfields on the ( 3 , 2)-dimensional supermanifold and @xmath69 .",
    "the celebrated hc condition ( 6 ) leads to the following relationships amongst the basic , auxiliary and secondary fields [ 23,24 ] @xmath70 where we have made the choices @xmath71 and @xmath72 which are , finally , identified with the nakanishi - lautrup type auxiliary fields of the 3d local quantum field theory .",
    "it is to be noted that , to satisfy the hc ( 6 ) , one sets equal to zero the grassmannian components of the super tensor @xmath73 in super 2-form @xmath74 . the equation @xmath75 [ that is quoted in ( 8) ] is the curci - ferrari ( cf ) restriction which is one of the key _",

    "this condition is derived from hc when one sets equal to zero the @xmath76 component of the super curvature tensor @xmath73 .",
    "the cf condition plays an important role in providing the proof for the absolute anticommutativity of the ( anti-)brst transformations .",

    "before we wrap up this section , we would like to state that the equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) imply that : @xmath83 .",
    "this mapping establishes a relationship between the ( anti-)brst transformations and the translational generators along the grassmannian directions of the @xmath46-dimensional supermanifold .",
    "this key relationship entails upon the ( anti-)brst transformations , emerging from our superfield formalism , to be _ always _ nilpotent of order two ( @xmath0 ) and absolutely anticommuting in nature because of the fact that @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",

    "these quantities must remain unaffected by the presence of the grassmannian variables when the former entities are generalized onto the ( 3 , 2)-dimensional supermanifold .",
