    "our knowledge on the evolution of galaxies comes from the study of the properties of families of galaxies at different redshifts .",
    "observable quantities like magnitudes , colors , structural parameters , velocity dispersions and line strengths are combined into well - established relations like , for instance , the color - magnitude relation ( e.g. bower , lucey , & ellis 1992 ; kodama et al .",
    "1998 ) , the mg-@xmath21 relation @xcite , the fundamental plane ( dressler et al . 1987 ; djorgovski & davies 1987 ; jrgensen , franx , & kjrgaard 1996 ) and its projection in the @xmath0 ",
    "@xmath1 plane , that is the kormendy relation ( kormendy 1977 ; capaccioli , caon , donofrio 1992 ; ziegler et al .",
    "these relations can now be studied over a significant fraction of the age of the universe .",
    "studies of the properties of early - type galaxies in rich clusters lead to a large amount of observational evidence in favor of the passive evolution scenario , in which an early ( @xmath222 ) and short ( @xmath161 gyr ) burst of star formation is followed by a long period where the aging of stellar populations drives the observed properties of galaxies through intermediate redshifts until the present epoch ( kodama & arimoto 1997 ; stanford , eisenhardt , & dickinson 1998 ; jrgensen et al . 1999 ; kelson et al . 2000a , and references therein ) .",
    "on the other side , the alternative scenario of the hierarchical merging seems also consistent with most of the existing data ( e.g. kauffmann & charlot 1998 ) , indicating either that the present observational evidence is not sufficient to discriminate between the two pictures or that galaxy evolution is driven by both mechanisms .    the half - light radius and the mean surface brightness of a galaxy measure the size and the density of the luminous matter .",
    "these quantities are related both to the gravitational potential of the galaxy and to the properties of the stellar populations .",
    "the relations existing between the structural parameters of galaxies have been recently studied at intermediate redshifts , both in the form of @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) and as luminosity - size relation @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that disks at @xmath220.5 are in the average @xmath16 1.5 mag brighter than in local galaxies .",
    "this was contrasted by the results of @xcite who found no luminosity evolution in disks up to @xmath130.9 .",
    "@xcite found that the kormendy relation of cluster galaxies at @xmath23 and @xmath24 is consistent with the passive evolution scenario .",
    "the kormendy relation has also proven to be a powerful tool to test the expansion of the universe by the measurement of the cosmological dimming ( i.e. for the tolman test ) .",
    "@xcite studied the kormendy relation up to @xmath25 , finding that the data are consistent with the cosmic expansion together with passive evolution .",
    "finally , the structural parameters enter the fundamental plane of early - type galaxies , of which the kormendy relation is a two - dimensional projection . due to its very small scatter ,",
    "the fundamental plane is a powerful tool to study the evolution of the m / l ratio of galaxies belonging to distant clusters .",
    "the recent determinations of the fundamental plane at intermediate redshifts constrain the epoch of star formation in early - type galaxies at large redshifts ( @xmath222 for @xmath17=0.3 or @xmath225 for @xmath17=1 and @xmath18 ; see van dokkum & franx 1996 ; jrgensen et al . 1999 ; kelson et al .",
    "however , these studies have to face with the problem of the progenitor bias , i.e. with our ignorance of the relationship between local galaxies and their high redshift counterparts ( see van dokkum & franx 2001 for a thorough discussion ) .",
    "a clue for the interpretation and for the applications of the scaling laws is the dependence of the structural parameters on wavelength .",
    "the basic distinction between optical and nir is that the optical wavebands are very sensitive to the effects of metallicity ( through line - blanketing ) and to the content of younger populations ( dust absorption included ) , while the nir wavebands are dominated by the old , more quiescent , stellar populations and are virtually unaffected by dust absorption . for these reasons",
    "the nir is the best tracer of the mass distribution inside a galaxy .",
    "local galaxies are smaller at nir wavebands than in the visible , with a similar , though weaker , trend also within the optical wavelength range ( scodeggio et al . 1998 ; pahre , de carvalho , & djorgovski 1998 ) .",
    "this behavior is confirmed by the relatively large optical - nir color gradients measured in early - type galaxies , the optical - optical gradients being usually much smaller , except when the @xmath26band is involved ( peletier et al .",
    "1990a ; peletier , valentijn , & jameson 1990b ; hinkley @xmath27",
    "i m 2001 ; nelson et al . 2001 ) .",
    "small optical color gradients were recently measured in distant ( up to @xmath131 ) cluster early - type galaxies by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "these authors concluded that metallicity is the primary factor driving the color gradients .",
    "the derivation of the structural parameters at intermediate redshifts is affected by the problem of the small angular size of the galaxies , whose half - light radii are typically less than 1 arcsec . for this reason",
    "many works were based on imaging taken with the hst .",
    "it has been demonstrated , however , that reliable structural parameters can be derived from ground - based photometry as well , on high resolution ( @xmath28/pxl ) and exceptional seeing ( @xmath29 ) conditions , provided that the properties of the psf are carefully taken into account @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we obtain the first multi - band large set of structural parameters for galaxies at an intermediate redshift ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the data are derived from ground - based ( eso - ntt ) photometry in two optical ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) and one nir ( @xmath30 ) wavebands .",
    "the derived values for the structural parameters will be published in a forthcoming paper addressed to the study of galaxy evolution by means of the scaling laws ( busarello et al .",
    "2001a , in preparation ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the sample and the data used in this study are presented in   [ samples ] . the derivation of the structural parameters is outlined in   [ strsec ] .",
    "the structural parameters from hst imaging are derived in   [ hst_hst ] , where the results from sersic models and bulge - disk decomposition are compared . in   [ sec_hst_r ]",
    "we use hst photometry for a subset of galaxies to verify the reliability of ground - based structural parameters .",
    "the structural parameters are presented in ",
    "[ op_nir ] , where we make a comparison between optical and nir properties at @xmath9 and with the values at @xmath31 . in   [ secgrad ]",
    "we analyze the optical and nir structure of galaxies in terms of internal color gradients .",
    "the results are discussed in   [ conc ] .",
    "ac118 ( abell 2744 ) is a rich ( ` coma - like ' ) galaxy cluster at redshift @xmath3 that was studied by several authors in relation to its galaxy population , x - ray and radio properties and gravitational lensing @xcite .",
    "new photometric data and medium resolution spectroscopy has been collected during three observing runs ( october 1998 - september 2000 ) at the eso new technology telescope .",
    "the data of interest for the present work are the imaging in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 wavebands obtained with the emmi instrument and the imaging in the @xmath30 waveband obtained with sofi .",
    "the photometry is complemented with hst archive data consisting of a single pointing on the cluster center .",
    "the relevant information on the data is given in table  [ ac118_data ] .",
    "the reduction of the @xmath6band image is described in @xcite , while the reduction of the ntt optical data will be presented elsewhere ( busarello et al .",
    "2002b , in preparation ) .",
    "the hst data were retrieved from the stsci archive and reduced following the steps described in @xcite .",
    "the ntt photometry was used to calibrate the hst imaging into the johnson @xmath32band as outlined in appendix a.    the samples used in the present study consist in : a ) 50 galaxies in the hst field ; b ) 37 galaxies in the hst field in common with the ground - based @xmath32band sample ; c ) 58 galaxies in common in the @xmath33 and @xmath32band ; d ) 93 galaxies in common in the @xmath32 and @xmath6band .",
    "samples c and d are the results of two selection steps .",
    "the first selection was based on photometric redshifts @xcite , as derived from the above photometry plus @xmath34 and @xmath26band ( new ntt data and ntt archive data respectively ) .",
    "the reliability of the photometric redshifts was verified on 75 galaxies with available spectra ( merluzzi et al .",
    "2002 , in preparation ) .",
    "morphology is not a selection criterion in this study , since a morphological classification is not possible from our data .",
    "the photometric redshifts algorithm flags the galaxies according to whether their colors are consistent with early- or late - type template spectra .",
    "we did not use this classification as a selection criterion , and retained in the samples all the galaxies with the correct photometric redshift .",
    "we remark , however , that only 7 galaxies out of 93 in sample d are ` late - type ' according to their photometric properties ( from @xmath35 to @xmath30 ) .",
    "the second selection step is based on the reliability of the measurement of the structural parameters and is the result of the analysis presented in   [ simsec ] . this lead to include in the sample the galaxies brighter than @xmath5=21 and @xmath4=20.5 , and to exclude objects with an estimated @xmath0 smaller than 0.15 arcsec .",
    "samples a and b were selected in order to obtain 1 ) reliable structural parameters in the ntt @xmath32band and 2 ) the largest number of galaxies in the hst field with the same range of sizes and luminosities of the ground - based samples .",
    "this lead to include galaxies brighter than @xmath5=21 and to exclude objects with @xmath0 smaller than 0.15 arcsec both in the ntt and in the hst image .",
    "a further ( a posteriori ) selection was done for all the samples on the basis of the results of the fitting : objects with very large uncertainties ( @xmath36100% ) were not considered in the analysis .",
    "this however lead to exclude only 2% of the objects .",
    "morphological classification from hst imaging by @xcite is available for 21 out of 93 galaxies in sample d ( 17 out of 58 in sample c ) . out of these",
    ", 6 ( 6 ) are classified as ellipticals , 10 ( 7 ) as s0 , and 5 ( 4 ) as spirals .",
    "these numbers reflect the overall distribution of morphological types in ac118 , which is dominated by early - type ( mainly s0 ) galaxies @xcite .",
    "the question of morphological types will be resumed in the conclusions .",
    "the relevant information on the samples is summarized in table 2 .",
    "since the typical galaxy sizes at @xmath130.3 are smaller than @xmath37 , it is crucial to take into account the effects of the point spread function ( psf ) when deriving structural parameters from ground - based data .",
    "this means that a proper model for the galaxy surface brightness ( sb ) has to be convolved with the psf and fitted to the observed sb .",
    "this is usually performed : 1 ) by one - dimensional fitting algorithms ( e.g. saglia et al . 1997 ) or 2 ) by two - dimensional methods @xcite . in case 1 ) the integrated light curve or the sb profile are derived by an elliptical fit to the galaxy isophotes and then fitted with the adopted model . in the two - dimensional approach , a direct fit of the galaxy sb is performed .",
    "advantages and drawbacks of both methods have been largely discussed in previous works ( see kelson et al .",
    "2000b , and references therein ) . in the present study",
    "we adopt the two - dimensional fitting approach for two reasons : 1 ) many galaxies in ac118 belong to overlapping systems , and only the 2d approach can deal properly with these cases ; 2 ) isophotal fitting of the ground - based images should be performed on a very small number of pixels , resulting in poorly constrained isophotes .",
    "the sb of distant galaxies is well described by two - dimensional models with constant ellipticity and position angle . in this study , we use two kinds of models : the sersic model ( sersic 1968 ) and the ( @xmath38 ) bulge + disk ( @xmath39 ) model . since the @xmath39 decomposition requires high resolution and signal to noise ratios ( see ratnatunga , griffiths , & ostrander 1999 ) , this model is applied only to the hst data .",
    "ground - based structural parameters are derived by fitting the sersic models .",
    "the models used for the psf of the ntt and hst images are presented in   [ psfsec ] while the fitting algorithm and the galaxy models are described in   [ fitsec ] .",
    "the limits of applicability of the fitting algorithm are set in   [ simsec ] .",
    "to model the psf of the hst image , we used the tiny tim 5.0 software package @xcite . since the psf depends on the position on the field , different models were created for each galaxy at the corresponding chip location .",
    "effects of psf under - sampling and broadening from image jittering are smaller than few percents of @xmath0 for the typical sizes of galaxies at this redshift and therefore these were ignored ( see kelson et al .",
    "2000b ) .    to model the psf of the ntt images we proceeded as follows .",
    "stars in the cluster field were selected by the stellar index parameter @xmath40 of s - extractor @xcite and from the aperture magnitude . to minimize star ",
    "galaxy classification errors , we considered only objects with @xmath41 .",
    "we selected sources with @xmath42 mag in the sofi field and @xmath43 mag in the region not covered from the infrared imaging .",
    "such criteria allowed to obtain a sufficient @xmath44 to model the psf .",
    "the reliability of the selection is also supported by the photometric redshift algorithm : the colors of the candidate stars do not match galaxy template spectra at any redshift .",
    "the psf of the ntt images is well described by a sum of two gaussians convolved with the pixel function ( see appendix  [ app_gpsf ] for details ) .",
    "the model has nine relevant parameters : the center coordinates , the central intensity , the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the two gaussians in the two perpendicular directions , the ratio of the central intensities , and the local value of the background .",
    "the fits were performed by a @xmath45 minimizing algorithm based on the levenberg - marquardt method @xcite . typically , the residuals from the fitting are smaller than 5% .",
    "the uncertainties on fitting parameters were estimated by numerical simulations on models with gaussian noise . for each pixel , the standard deviation of the noise was computed by the distribution of the fit residuals in the adjacent pixels ] .",
    "figure  [ psffit ] shows the values of the psf parameters in the @xmath33 , @xmath32 and @xmath6band as a function of the distance to the image centers .",
    "in general the psf tends to become broader as this distance increases .",
    "the effect is very weak in the @xmath6band image , while significant variations are found in the optical images .",
    "the trends of the parameters were modeled with empirical analytic curves , that were then used to obtain the psf model relative to each galaxy position .",
    "galaxy images were fitted by the following model : @xmath46 where @xmath7 is the galaxy brightness distribution , that is described by a set of parameters @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the psf model , @xmath49 is the value of the local background , and the symbol @xmath50 denotes the convolution . for the sersic models , the parameters @xmath51 are : the effective major semi - axis @xmath52 , the central surface brightness @xmath53 , the sersic index @xmath2 , the axial ratio @xmath54 , the position angle @xmath55 , the coordinates of the photometric center and the local value of the background . in the case of the @xmath39 decomposition , the parameters that enter the fit are those of two sersic models with @xmath56 and @xmath57 for the bulge and the disk respectively .",
    "the fit parameters are used to derive the total magnitude @xmath58 ( e.g. saglia et al . 2000 ) , @xmath0 and @xmath1 . for sersic models , @xmath0",
    "is computed as the equivalent radius of the ellipse that encloses half of the total galaxy light , i.e. @xmath59 . for the @xmath39 decomposition",
    ", @xmath0 is calculated from the growth curve of circular aperture magnitudes . in both cases",
    ", we have @xmath60 . for the sersic models we found that both methods of computing @xmath0 agree within @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , the difference of the two definitions can be ignored in the following analysis .",
    "the parameters @xmath47 and @xmath49 were derived by a least squares fit , by minimizing the function @xmath62 \\ ,   \\label{chieq}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 is the observed brightness distribution , @xmath64 is an index running on image pixels and @xmath65 is a penalty function introduced to avoid ` not allowed ' regions of the parameter space ( i.e. unrealistic values that can be found on local minima of @xmath45 ) .",
    "the @xmath45 minimization was performed by the levenberg - marquardt algorithm .",
    "the convolution with the psf was computed straightly in the real domain in order to avoid high frequencies problems when convolving galaxy models by the fast fourier transform .",
    "bad pixels , degraded regions and pixels contaminated by background objects , were excluded from summation in equation  [ chieq ] . to this aim ,",
    "a masking image was created interactively for each galaxy .",
    "overlapping objects were fitted simultaneously .",
    "uncertainties on structural parameters are usually estimated either from the formal errors on fitting results or by numerical simulations .",
    "the formal uncertainties are derived by the topology of the @xmath45 function near to the solution and therefore they do not take into account the various sources of errors on the estimated parameters ( e.g. smith et al .",
    "numerical simulations give more reliable uncertainties but they depend on the adopted galaxy model and are much more expensive in terms of computation time . as a compromise between accuracy and amount of computation time ,",
    "we used a first order approximation : the uncertainties on the fit parameters were estimated from the derivatives of the @xmath45 function taking into account the noise in the galaxy image and the uncertainties on the psf parameters .",
    "details are given in appendix  [ app_err ] .      to test the performance of the fitting procedure and to set the limits to its applicability , we created two sets of simulations based on sersic @xmath66 models convolved with the ntt @xmath32band psf and with the typical noise of ground - based data . to take into account the uncertainties on the psf ,",
    "all the simulations were generated with the same psf but the fits were performed with different psf models whose parameters were generated in agreement with the corresponding uncertainties ( see   [ psfsec ] ) .",
    "the first set of simulations consist in @xmath67 galaxies spanning the full magnitude range in the @xmath32band ( 19 mag @xmath68 mag ) .",
    "two values of @xmath0 were considered : @xmath69 and @xmath70 , that correspond to the sizes of a small and a typical galaxy in a cluster at @xmath71 ( e.g. kelson et al .",
    "in figure  [ sim_mtot ] we give the results of the simulations in terms of differences between the input model parameters and the output from the fitting procedure .",
    "the quantities shown are @xmath0 , the axis ratio @xmath54 ( both given as logarithms ) , @xmath58 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and the ` fundamental plane parameter ' , @xmath72 , that is the combination of the structural parameters entering the fundamental plane .",
    "it can be seen that the scatter of the fit parameters around the ` true ' values is relatively small for @xmath7322 where it amounts at most to 25% in @xmath0 , 0.5 mag in @xmath1 , 0.15 mag in @xmath58 , @xmath74 in @xmath75 and @xmath76 in @xmath54 .",
    "the scatter of @xmath2 is higher , and varies from @xmath77 at @xmath78 mag up to @xmath79 at @xmath80 mag .",
    "objects fainter than @xmath80 mag are affected by larger and systematic differences between input and computed parameters .",
    "the second set of simulations was created in order to test the fitting algorithm with respect to the galaxy size . to this aim ,",
    "a wide range of values of @xmath0 was explored ( @xmath81 to @xmath82 ) for three sersic models with @xmath83 respectively . for each value of @xmath0 ,",
    "a suitable value of @xmath1 was derived from the kormendy relation , whose slope and the zero point were calibrated a posteriori from the present sample . in figure",
    "[ sim_re ] , we show the comparison between true and estimated parameters .",
    "an inspection of figure  [ sim_re ] shows that the parameters are recovered with a relatively small scatter ( see above ) and without systematic errors for @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) for the whole range of @xmath2 values .",
    "the shape of light profile is subject to a small systematic error ( @xmath86 ) for @xmath87 below @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "we also notice that the scatter increases for large @xmath2 values , due to the effect of the uncertainties on the psf for galaxies with more concentrated profiles .",
    "the above results were used to derive the selection of the samples in this study .",
    "all the samples include the galaxies with @xmath84 in each band ; in the @xmath32band only galaxies with @xmath9021 mag were included as a conservative limit ; in the @xmath33band a more restrictive selection in magnitude ( @xmath9120.5 mag ) was necessary due to the lower s / n , while no further restriction was needed for the @xmath6band photometry .",
    "structural parameters were derived for @xmath92 galaxies in the hst image ( sample a of table  [ tab_sel ] ) , 42 of these objects are cluster members according to the photometric redshifts .",
    "galaxies were fitted by both sersic and @xmath39 models , and a flag @xmath93 was assigned to each galaxy for the different cases that were encountered during the fitting . for @xmath94 galaxies ,",
    "both models gave small fitting residuals , but the @xmath39 decomposition produced meaningless values of the structural parameters for the bulge or for the disk component ( e.g. @xmath95 ) .",
    "for such galaxies a possible second physical component is too weak or too small to be detected .",
    "however , except for one object that was excluded from the analysis , acceptable global parameters ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) were obtained from the @xmath39 fit so that such galaxies were retained in the sample and were flagged with @xmath96 . for @xmath97 objects ,",
    "both sersic and @xmath39 models gave small fitting residuals and acceptable estimates of the parameters .",
    "they were flagged with @xmath98 .",
    "@xmath99 was used to indicate @xmath100 galaxies for which residuals from the sersic model shown evidence for a second component that was properly described with the @xmath39 decomposition .",
    "the flags @xmath98 and @xmath99 were assigned by visual inspection of the galaxy fits as illustrated in figure  [ bd_s ] .",
    "finally , @xmath101 galaxies , of which some objects with very distorted morphology and some bcgs with very large residuals ( @xmath102 ) , were flagged with @xmath103 and excluded from the present analysis .",
    "fitting models suitable for such objects will be discussed in a forthcoming work .    in figure  [ bd_s_par ] ,",
    "we compare the structural parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath58 and @xmath75 obtained by different models .",
    "table  [ tab_bd ] shows the medians and the standard deviations of the differences in fitting parameters , and the relative bootstrap confidence intervals . by weighting each point in figure  [ bd_s_par ] with the fitting uncertainties (   [ fitsec ] )",
    ", we did not find significant variations of the estimates given in table  [ tab_bd ] .",
    "this also holds for the other comparisons of structural parameters in the present work ( see   4 and   5 ) .",
    "it is clear from table  [ tab_bd ] and from figure  [ bd_s_par ] that the mean differences of the parameters have no significant biases , also when galaxies with different flag @xmath93 are considered . on the other side ,",
    "the scatter in the structural parameters depends on the @xmath93 value : as expected , minimum values are obtained for @xmath98 when @xmath39 and sersic models give an equivalent description of the galaxy image .",
    "the scatter varies from @xmath104 to @xmath105 for @xmath0 , from @xmath106 mag to @xmath107 mag for @xmath1 , and from @xmath108 mag to @xmath109 mag for @xmath58 .",
    "one important fact is the robustness of the @xmath75 parameter against the adopted fitting method : due to the correlation between the errors in @xmath0 and in @xmath1 ( hamabe & kormendy 1987 ; jrgensen , franx , & kjrgaard 1995 ) , its scatter varies from @xmath110 for @xmath98 to @xmath111 for @xmath96 .",
    "the previous results are fully consistent with the findings of kelson et al .",
    "( 2000a ) , although they find a smaller dispersion ( @xmath112 ) between the @xmath75 parameters derived by different fitting methods .",
    "the results shown in figure  [ bd_s_par ] and table  [ tab_bd ] give a measure of the intrinsic uncertainties on the structural parameters of the galaxies in the present sample and will be used as a reference in the following sections .",
    "the 2d fits for a representative subsample of galaxies in the hst and ntt @xmath32band images are shown in figure  [ hst_r ] .",
    "although the residuals from the fit are more evident in the hst images due to the higher resolution and to the higher @xmath44 , both hst and ground - based images can be suitably fitted with the @xmath66 models , also when overlapping objects are considered .    to test the reliability of the ground - based structural parameters , we compared the estimates obtained by fitting sersic models to the hst and the ntt images of galaxies in the sample b of table  [ tab_sel ] . since both filters cover approximately the same spectral range ( rest - frame @xmath33band ) , we can rule out any difference between the two datasets due to a possible waveband dependence of the structural parameters .",
    "the structural parameters are compared in figure  [ conf_hst_r ] , where we plot the same quantities as in figure  [ bd_s_par ] . the medians and the standard deviations of the differences in @xmath113 , @xmath1 , @xmath58 and @xmath75",
    "are given in table  [ tab_hst_r ] .",
    "table  [ tab_hst_r ] and figure  [ conf_hst_r ] prove that the mean differences of the parameters have no significant biases .",
    "the scatter between the two sets of measurements is relatively small : it amounts to @xmath114 for @xmath0 , @xmath115 mag for @xmath1 , @xmath116 mag for @xmath58 and @xmath117 for the @xmath75 parameter .",
    "it is worth to stress again that the @xmath75 parameter has significantly smaller dispersion with respect to the other quantities .",
    "the comparison with the results of the previous sections proves that the differences in the parameters derived from hst and from ntt photometry are of the same order of those found when applying different fitting methods to the hst image . in other words ,",
    "the difference between the structural parameters derived from hst and from ntt data is consistent with the precision with which these quantities can be measured ( see kelson et al . 2000a ; jrgensen et al .",
    "we thus conclude that reliable structural parameters can be still derived for typical sizes and luminosities of cluster galaxies at redshift @xmath71 by using ground - based data taken in ordinary observing conditions ( i.e. seeing @xmath118 and pixel scale @xmath119pxl ) .",
    "the @xmath33 and @xmath32band structural parameters for @xmath120 galaxies ( sample c of table  [ tab_sel ] ) are compared in figure  [ v_r_par ] and table  [ tab_v_r ] . to allow a direct comparison ,",

    "we defer further considerations to   [ secgrad ] , where the results will be discussed in terms of color gradients .",

    "furthermore , the results of   6.1 indicate that the color gradients are mainly due to the difference in @xmath2 for @xmath158 and to the difference in @xmath0 for @xmath159 .",
    "the optical - nir color gradients are thus related to the relevance of the disk component , as it is apparent from figure  [ grad ] : galaxies with lower bulge - to - disk ratio ( @xmath165 ) have large @xmath152 color gradients , while bulge - dominated galaxies have moderate gradients .    in order to probe the origin of color gradients with the large wavelength baseline provided by the @xmath6band , we adopted two different models in which color gradients are driven by ( a ) ` pure age ' or ( m ) ` pure metallicity ' gradients .",
    "we used synthetic colors from the code of @xcite to simulate early  type galaxy spectra . an exponential star formation rate with time scale of 1 gyr",
    "was adopted . in model ( a ) we assumed that the inner stellar population ( @xmath166 ) is 6.25 gyr old at @xmath3",

    "the results shown in table  [ tab_grad_th ] may be summarized as follows .",
    "the pure age model is able to explain the evolution of the @xmath152 color gradient between @xmath9 and @xmath31 , but it fails to describe the @xmath121 gradient at @xmath9 .",
    "conversely , the pure metallicity model is able to reconcile the @xmath121 and @xmath152 color gradients at @xmath9 , but it fails to describe the evolution of the @xmath152 gradient as a function of look - back time .",
    "in this study we derived optical and nir structural parameters for galaxies belonging to the cluster ac118 at @xmath3 from ground - based photometry . the present data set constitutes the first large sample of structural parameters determined at intermediate redshifts in different wavebands and , in particular , it is the first such sample in the near - infrared .",
    "the samples consist in @xmath178=93 objects studied in the @xmath5 and @xmath30 wavebands and in @xmath178=58 galaxies studied in the @xmath33band .",
    "the reliability of the data was verified by comparison with the results from hst photometry for a subsample of galaxies : the scatter between measurements from hst- and from ground - based photometry is equivalent to the scatter between parameters determined with two different fitting methods from hst images , namely of @xmath1635% in @xmath0 . given that these values of the scatter are generally claimed to be a measure of the ` intrinsic uncertainty ' in structural parameter measurements , we can state that reliable structural parameters can be still derived from ground - based photometry in ordinary observing conditions at least up to @xmath9 .",
    "since morphology was not a selection criterion in this study , some remarks are needed for the comparison of our results with other works .",
    "@xcite established that @xmath179 of the galaxies in the core of ac118 are early - types while @xmath180 are spirals .",
    "they also found a significant rise in the fraction of s0 galaxies with respect to the local density - morphology relation .",
    "morphological classification from @xcite is available for 21 galaxies in sample d. the number of spirals is 5 , of which 3 have @xmath1811.5 while the other two have @xmath182 .",
    "only one of the spirals has ` late - type ' colors , while the others lie on the red sequence of ac118 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that all the remaining galaxies with ` late - type ' colors lie outside of the cluster core and have @xmath183 .",
    "they are likely disk galaxies dominated by young stellar populations .",
    "these facts are in agreement with a scenario in which spirals are accreted into the cluster from the field , cease to form stars , become gas - deficient objects and eventually undergo a morphological transformation @xcite .",
    "the remaining galaxies with morphological information consist in 10 s0 , eight of which with @xmath184 and two with @xmath185 , and 6 ellipticals , for which we find @xmath182 .",
    "we stress that the galaxies with large disks and late - type colors are only @xmath186 of galaxies in sample d.    the main feature concerning the multi - band properties of galaxies is that these are much more concentrated in the nir than in the optical .",
    "the mean ratio of nir to optical half - light radii ( @xmath187 ) is not different from that found in local samples of early - type galaxies ( @xmath106 , e.g. pahre 1999 ) , but the situation is complicated by the systematic differences found in the shape of the brightness distribution : galaxies with low @xmath2 value have a light profile more peaked in the center in the @xmath30-band ( @xmath188 ) , while for @xmath182 a lower @xmath189 is observed ( @xmath190 ) .",
    "such trends can be interpreted as due to the increase of the disk fraction when @xmath2 approaches unity .    to discuss the combined effects of half - light radii and sersic indices , we derived the optical and nir color gradients by means of equation 4",
    ". most of galaxies in ac118 do not show significant optical color gradients , with a median value of @xmath153 .",
    "this result is consistent with previous estimates of optical color gradients at intermediate redshifts @xcite .",
    "conversely , strong negative gradients are found in optical  nir colors : the median of the @xmath152 gradients amounts to @xmath160 .",
    "moreover , this effect depends on the shape of the light profile : the @xmath152 gradient increases from @xmath191 for galaxies with low @xmath2 value to @xmath192 for @xmath182 . again",
    "this result can be explained by an increase in the disk fraction when @xmath165 .    to interpret these results in terms of the properties of the stellar populations",
    ", we introduced a pure age and a pure metallicity model .",
    "we used the @xmath152 gradients to calibrate both models and to predict @xmath121 color gradients at @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , the evolution of color gradients as inferred by the models was compared with the measurements by @xcite for a sample of nearby elliptical galaxies .",
    "the age model is not able to reconcile our optical and nir estimates at @xmath3 since a significant negative gradient is predicted in @xmath121 ( @xmath193 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the predicted color gradient agree with the measurements at @xmath194 .",
    "conversely , the pure metallicity model gives correct results at @xmath3 but predicts too strong nir gradients at @xmath194 .",
    "since the age model is able to describe the evolution of color gradients , whereas the metallicity model correctly explains the dependence of color gradients on wavelength , we argue that a model in which effects of age and metallicity are consistently combined could explain optical and nir color gradients from @xmath3 up to @xmath194 .",
    "finally , we remark that dust likely affects the optical - nir color gradients .",
    "dust is actually presents in the core of most early - type galaxies @xcite and is known to produce high central color gradients in bulges of s0 and spiral galaxies ( e.g. peletier et al .",

    "the distributions of both the optical and nir half - light radii of galaxies at @xmath9 are found to be consistent with those of coma early - type galaxies .",

    "<S> structural parameters ( half - light radius @xmath0 , mean effective surface brightness @xmath1 , and sersic index @xmath2 , parameterizing the light profile shape ) are derived for a sample of galaxies in the rich cluster ac118 at @xmath3 : so far the largest ( n=93 ) sample of galaxies at intermediate - redshift with structural parameters measured in the near - infrared . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters are obtained in two optical wavebands ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) and in the @xmath6band , corresponding approximately to @xmath7 , @xmath4 and @xmath8 rest - frame .    </S>",
    "<S> the distributions of @xmath0 at @xmath3 match those for the coma cluster ( i.e. for the local universe ) both in the optical and in the nir . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath6band distribution is of particular interest , since the nir light mimics the mass distribution of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the similarity of the distributions for the two clusters ( ac118 and coma ) proves that the galaxies at the bright end of the luminosity function did not significantly change their sizes since @xmath9 to the present epoch .    the ratio of the optical to the nir half - light radius shows a marked trend with the shape of the light profile ( sersic index @xmath2 ) . in galaxies with @xmath10 ( typical bright ellipticals ) </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 , while the average ratio is 0.8 for galaxies with lower @xmath2 ( typical disk systems ) . moreover , the nir sersic index is systematically larger than in the optical for @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> these results , translated into optical and optical - nir color gradients , imply that the optical color gradients at @xmath130.3 are similar to those of nearby galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the optical - nir color gradients are in the average larger , ranging from -0.73 mag / dex for @xmath12 to -0.35 mag / dex for @xmath10 .    </S>",
    "<S> models with ` pure age ' or ` pure metallicity ' gradients are unable to reconcile our color gradients estimates with observations at @xmath14 , but we argue that the combined effects of age and metallicity might explain consistently the observed data : passive evolution ( plus the possible effect of dust absorption ) may account for the differences between the optical and nir structural properties .    the lack of any major change in @xmath15 since @xmath9 suggests that merging involving bright galaxies did not play a significant role in the last @xmath164.4 gyr ( @xmath17=0.3 , @xmath18 , h@xmath19 km s@xmath20mpc@xmath20 ) .    the results of the present paper will be applied to the study of the scaling laws in subsequent works . </S>"
