    "since the discovery of superconductivity in ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1  in 1979 @xcite , the bechgaard salts or the highly anisotropic organic superconductors ( tmtsf)@xmath0x  ( where tmtsf is tetramethyltetraselenfulvalene and x is anion pf@xmath3 , asf@xmath3 , clo@xmath3  ) are one of the most well studied systems @xcite . the quasi - one - dimensionality ( 1d ) is a consequence of the crystal structure , where the tmtsf molecules are stacked in columns in the @xmath4  direction ( along which the highest conductivity occurs ) , and the resulting anisotropy in conductivity is commonly taken to be @xmath5 .",
    "the rich phase diagram of ( tmtsf)@xmath0x  salts exhibits various low temperature phases under pressure and/or in magnetic field , among which the spin density wave ( sdw ) , field induced sdw ( fisdw ) with quantum hall effect and spin triplet superconductivity are very intriguing @xcite .",
    "( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1  is metallic down to @xmath6k , where the transition into the semiconducting sdw takes place .",
    "it is known that sdw in ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1  undergoes another transition at @xmath7 ( at 3.54@xmath8k at ambient pressure ) @xcite .",
    "the indication of the subphase was first seen by nmr @xcite , where @xmath9 diverges and the spin susceptibility changes at @xmath10 .",
    "the transition at @xmath10  is preserved through the entire @xmath11 phase diagram .",
    "furthermore a calorimetric transition at 3.5@xmath8k with a large hysteretic phenomenons in the temperature range 2.54@xmath8k ( caused by the sample history ) has been observed and interpreted as an indication of a glass transition @xcite . on the other hand , the low frequency dielectric relaxation of sdw in",
    "( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1  did not show the existence of the glass transition @xcite .",
    "since then the sdw state was widely investigated , but the nature of the subphase remained controversial .",
    "recently we have studied the @xmath12  axis magnetoresistance ( mr ) of ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1  at ambient pressure and with magnetic field rotated within the @xmath13plane .",
    "the mr has different behaviour for @xmath14k and @xmath15k @xcite .",
    "for @xmath14k mr is described in terms of the quasiparticle in a magnetic field , where the imperfect nesting term @xcite plays the crucial role . however , in order to describe mr below 4@xmath8k we have introduced a rather artificial scattering term .",
    "more recently , unconventional density waves ( ucdw or usdw ) have been proposed as a possible ground state in electronic systems in organic conductors and heavy fermions @xcite . unlike the conventional dw , the udw is defined as the dw where the order parameter @xmath16 depends on the quasi - particle momentum @xmath17 . in particular , ucdw appears to describe the striking angular dependent magnetoresistance ( admr ) found in the low temperature phase of @xmath18(et)@xmath0khg(scn)@xmath3 @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", we have shown that the remarkable features of admr in ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1  below @xmath19k ( the decrease in the quasiparticle energy gap for @xmath20 and the sudden change in the angular dependence of the energy gap in the presence of magnetic field @xmath21 as the temperature crosses @xmath22 ) can be described within the model sdw plus usdw using the usdw order parameter @xmath23 , where @xmath24 with @xmath25 @xcite .    in this paper we shall present the hall resistivity data in ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1  for @xmath14k and @xmath15k and discuss them within the model of sdw+usdw .",
    "the hall resistivity @xmath26 in two crystals of ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1  with dimension @xmath27mm@xmath28 and @xmath29mm@xmath28 was measured with 6 contact method as shown in inset of fig.[fig.fig1 ] . the results shown and discussed here were obtained on one of them , and similar qualitative behaviour was observed on another sample , too .",
    "the measurements were performed between 2.0@xmath8k and 6.3@xmath8k , with magnetic field up to 9@xmath8 t .",
    "the @xmath4  direction of the monocrystal is the highest conductivity direction , the intermediate conductivity @xmath12  is perpendicular to @xmath4  in the @xmath30  plane and the lowest conductivity @xmath31  direction is perpendicular to the @xmath30  ( and @xmath32 ) plane .     versus magnetic field @xmath21 at several fixed temperatures ( @xmath15k ) .",
    "inset : the contacts arrangement.,width=340 ]    the current flow was along the @xmath4  axis , the magnetic field @xmath33 along @xmath31  direction and the hall voltage was detected along the @xmath12  axis .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the hall resistivity is shown in fig.[fig.fig1 ] ( @xmath15k ) and fig.[fig.fig2 ] ( @xmath14k ) .     versus magnetic field @xmath21 at several fixed temperatures ( @xmath14k).,width=340 ]    the general @xmath34 and @xmath21",
    "dependencies are consistent with earlier data by uji _",

    "@xcite , although their main objective is the study of the rapid quantum oscillation .",
    "as is readily seen from fig.[fig.fig1 ] and [ fig.fig2 ] , the negative hall resistivity is much smaller for @xmath14k than for @xmath15k . according to @xcite ,",
    "the hall resistivity in the quasi one dimensional system is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the conductivity tensor .",
    "if we neglect the quantum hall effect , which contributes a new term in @xmath37 @xcite , we obtain @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the quasiparticle density and @xmath40 is the quasiparticle energy gap in the presence of magnetic field @xmath21 .    on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that @xmath41 has no activation form where @xmath42 is parallel to the @xmath43  axis @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation is that the conductivity parallel to the @xmath43  axis has another channel of which quasiparticle has no energy gap .",
    "a similar approach has been used in the quantitative analysis of @xmath44 in the fisdw state in ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1  under high pressure @xcite .",
    "therefore , the fitting of our hall data is done with @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are temperature dependent constants , and @xmath48 we took these expressions from @xcite , with @xmath49 and @xmath50 . here , we limit ourselves to the case @xmath51",
    ". the results of the fitting procedure are shown on both figures as the dotted lines ( the values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 are given in table [ table ] ) .",
    "we have an excellent agreement with the experimental data .",
    "we note that @xmath46 is almost independent of temperature , while @xmath47 decreases as temperature decreases .",
    "the values of @xmath52 s used in the present fitting ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) are somewhat smaller than the ones used earlier @xcite , but they are of the same order of magnitude . also , the exponent @xmath55 is somewhat strange ( naturally , we expect @xmath56 ) , but the similar exponent has been found in fitting the diagonal component of the magnetoresistance tensor @xcite .",
    ".table with fitting constants .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the agreement between the model and experimental data implies that the appearance of usdw below @xmath22 , over the preexisting sdw , with a new quasiparticle energy gap appears to describe the hall resistivity consistently",
    ". in particular , the rapid increase of the hall resistivity below @xmath22 testifies the rapid change in the quasiparticle energy gap across @xmath22 . in order to further test the present model the hall resistivity data with the magnetic field away from the @xmath31  axis are highly desirable",
    "we have completed the study of the resistivity tensor in ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1  below @xmath22 . for @xmath51",
    "we have shown that an approach with usdw+sdw below @xmath10  gives an excellent fit of the hall resistivity data .",
    "this further supports our proposal that usdw appearing on top of existing sdw in ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1  below @xmath22 gives a consistent description of the resistivity tensor .",
    "this experimental work was performed on samples prepared by k. bechgaard .",
