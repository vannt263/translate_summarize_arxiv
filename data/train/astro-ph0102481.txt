    "any black holes formed from the final core collapse of massive stars within the central 5 pc of the milky way during the last 10 gyr should have migrated to the galactic center ( gc ) owing to dynamical friction off ordinary stars ( morris 1993 ) .",
    "miralda - escud & gould ( 2000 , hereafter mg ) found that the majority of these black holes survive capture by the massive black hole sgr a * and should still be present in the gc today .",
    "low - mass stars older than @xmath9gyr should have been expelled from this region by the relaxation process .",
    "if stars with an initial mass greater than @xmath10 generally produce black holes , then this black - hole cluster should contain about 20,000 members today .",
    "one of the methods to test for the existence of the black - hole cluster is microlensing of a background source , probably a bulge star .",
    "this method requires first the discovery of the two images of a bulge star lensed by sgr a * , and then the monitoring of these images to detect the short - duration ( weeks long ) microlensing events caused by the passage of one of the cluster black holes near an image .",
    "the observational challenge here is to identify the two images of a faint @xmath11 lensed star in a field crowded with @xmath12 stars of similar magnitude and brighter ( see   2.1 ) .",
    "hence , a resolution @xmath13 is required .",
    "such deep , high - resolution observations are beyond current capabilities , but may be achievable with improvements in adaptive optics allowing long exposures , and with ngst .",
    "it will then be possible to distinguish the pair of resolved images from the more numerous field stars by means of their positions , flux ratio , colors and proper motions , which are all related .",
    "we show in ",
    "2 , that there are likely to be a few such detectable image pairs at any given time .",
    "however , as we show in   3 ,",
    "the rate of events caused by cluster black holes is only about 1 per 100 years per image pair , so that still deeper observations will probably be required to detect stellar black holes . in   4 ,",
    "we show that the masses of these black holes could be measured either by photometric monitoring of a caustic crossing , or from their astrometric effects . finally , in   5 , we discuss implications of our results .",
    "alexander & sternberg ( 1999 ) calculated lensing rates for sgr a * considered as an isolated body , and obtained results that are broadly consistent with those presented here .",
    "the problem of microlensing of background disk sources by stars orbiting near sgr a * ( similar to the problem we treat here ) was investigated by alexander & loeb ( 2001 ) .",
    "the expected number of sources being lensed by sgr a * at any given time can be estimated empirically given three observational inputs : 1 ) the @xmath14-band luminosity function ( hereafter , lf ) of the sources , 2 ) the volume density of @xmath14-band light as a function of distance behind the gc , and 3 ) the extinction as a function of distance behind the gc .",
    "the first two of these are well determined from observations , as we summarize below .",
    "the last is not measured . for purposes of this paper",
    "we will assume that there is no significant additional extinction in the @xmath15kpc lying behind the gc , above and beyond the @xmath16 magnitudes of extinction known to lie in front of the gc ( e.g. , blum , sellgren , & depoy 1996 ) .",
    "we derive the ( dereddened ) bulge @xmath17 lf from the @xmath18-band lf measured by zoccali et al .",
    "( 2000 , hereafter z00 ; see their table 1 ) using the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "nicmos @xmath18 and @xmath19 images of a field lying at @xmath20 ( with a field size @xmath21 ) . to obtain the complete @xmath18-band lf , z00 combined their nicmos observations , which yield the lf from @xmath18=16.5 to @xmath18=24.5 , with the bright lf from the baade s window data of tiede , frogel , & terndrup ( 1995 ) which extends up to the tip of the red giant branch .",
    "we convert the nicmos part of this lf to @xmath22 using the reported extinction and observed @xmath23 color - magnitude diagram in z00 , and then convert to @xmath17 using the @xmath24 relation observed for nearby main - sequence stars ( e.g. ,  henry & mccarthy 1993 ) . for the bright extension of the lf , we convert to @xmath17 using the @xmath25 color - magnitude diagrams reported by tiede et al .",
    "( 1995 , figs . 6 and 7 ) .",
    "the resulting lf , expressed as the number of stars per square arc minute per k apparent magnitude ( i.e. , including our adopted extinction to the gc ) , is shown in figure 1 .",
    "it reaches @xmath26 , and includes bulge main sequence stars with masses @xmath27 .",
    "note that the lf for main - sequence stars is nearly constant throughout the entire bulge ( narayanan , gould , & depoy 1996 ) , while luminous stars are more abundant in the gc ; hence , this extension of the lf will underestimate the number of lensed luminous stars close to the gc .",
    "editor : please place fig . 1 here    to convert this to a local _ volume density _",
    "@xmath14 lf , @xmath28 , at a distance @xmath29 along the line of sight of sgr a * , we first write @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the local bulge mass density on the gc line of sight at a distance @xmath32 from us",
    ", @xmath33 is the bulge column density toward the z00 field , @xmath34 is the number of stars per @xmath17 magnitude in the z00 field , @xmath35kpc is the galactocentric distance , @xmath36 is the solid angle of the z00 field , @xmath37 , and where we assume @xmath38 . in practice , we set @xmath39 , thus neglecting the dimming due to larger distances , since this contribution is smaller than the uncertainty introduced by assuming a constant @xmath40 .",
    "the first factor on the right - hand side of equation ( [ eqn : conv1 ] ) depends only on the spatial distribution of the mass in the bulge , and not its normalization . to evaluate it",
    ", we use a combination of the kent ( 1992 ) model , which is based on k band images , and the dirbe data from dwek et al .",
    "the reason this combination is required is that the kent model is axisymmetric , and so does not include the effects of the bar which are important at large radius , while the dirbe map can not be applied at small radius because of its limited resolution .",
    "we rewrite this term as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the column density in the direction @xmath43 .",
    "we determine the first ratio from equation ( 3 ) in kent ( 1992 ) , except that we impose a constant density core within 0.7 pc due to relaxation effects around sgr a * ( mg ) .",
    "we determine the second ratio from the dirbe map ( fig .",
    "1a in dwek et al .  1995 ) , obtaining a value @xmath44 .",
    "note that this procedure is relatively insensitive to possible disk contamination of the z00 field since to leading order this contamination affects both the star counts and the dirbe map equally .",
    "we have also used this same procedure to predict the surface density of stars near sgr a * , which is found to be 440 arcsec@xmath45 stars with @xmath46 mag , and about 1000 arcsec@xmath45 with @xmath47 mag .",
    "the two images of a microlensed source will have magnifications given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the angular separation of the lens and source , @xmath50 are the positions of the two images , @xmath51 is the einstein radius , @xmath52 @xmath53 is the mass of sgr a * , @xmath54 , @xmath29 is the distance to the source , and @xmath55 .",
    "the angular separation of the two lensed images of a background star at @xmath56 1 kpc is @xmath57 , clearly large enough to resolve them . on the other hand ,",
    "the duration of the `` microlensing event '' is very long , given the typical proper motion of bulge stars of a few mas per year .",
    "this implies that the usual method of microlensing detection from the magnification lightcurve is impractical .",
    "thus , to detect a lensed source , it is essential to identify _ a pair of images _ , which can be done from their relative magnifications and proper motions ( both of which are unambiguously predicted from their positions relative to sgr a * ) , as well as their common dereddened color .",
    "the expected number of observable lenses @xmath5 is simply the number for which the fainter image is brighter than the threshold of detectability , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , \\label{eqn : nlens}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the cumulative lf .",
    "we use @xmath61 kpc , effectively assuming that additional obscuration becomes important farther than 1 kpc behind the gc .",
    "we find for @xmath62 , that @xmath63 , which can be summarized , @xmath64 thus , in order to have a reasonable probability of finding one lensed star , the inner @xmath65 of the gc must be imaged down to at least @xmath66 .",
    "once a lensed image pair is detected , it is mainly the brighter member that will be useful to search for black - hole cluster members .",
    "figure 1 shows the distribution of brighter and fainter members ( solid and dashed lines , respectively ) for the three cases @xmath67 . from 0.7 pc and up to 1 kpc behind the gc the contributions of equal logarithmic intervals of @xmath68",
    "are 24% , 31% , and 45% .",
    "therefore , although most lensed sources will be from the `` outer '' bulge , with @xmath69 , a significant fraction will be close to sgr a * , with @xmath70mas ( @xmath71 250 au ) , corresponding to @xmath72 3 pc .",
    "hence , detection of these images , at @xmath73mas , might be compromised by extra extinction or emission from an accretion flow / disk around sgr a*.    in the above calculations it has been assumed that there is essentially no extra extinction in the 1 kpc behind the gc .",
    "in fact , most of the extinction measured towards the gc is thought not to arise in the immediate vicinity of the galactic center , but several kpc away , in a ring of molecular material .",
    "if this holds behind the gc as well , then our results for @xmath5 are not affected .",
    "on the other hand , if the situation behind the gc is different than in front of it , there are two possibilities .",
    "first , if , say , @xmath74 magnitude of extinction is uniformly distributed across the first kpc behind , then the closer sources will be the main contributors to @xmath5 , and the numbers quoted in equation ( 6 ) would be reduced by about 30 - 40% .",
    "a second possibility is that the extra extinction is concentrated close to the gc , in which case all the sources behind are equally affected .",
    "hence , if there is 1 mag of extra extinction close to the gc , then the quoted numbers for @xmath5 would be for @xmath75 = ( 22,23,24 ) , instead of ( 21,22,23 ) .",
    "the detection of lensed sources will itself allow a quantitative probe of extinction behind the gc , as we discuss in   5 .    in figure 2",
    "we show as solid lines the shear distribution @xmath76 of the brighter pair member obtained for the three magnitude limits .",
    "pairs with high magnifications ( shear close to unity ) are less numerous than those with small magnifications .",
    "the area under any of these curves corresponds to the number of lensed pairs that are expected to be found at the corresponding detection threshold .",
    "the solid line in the left hand panel of figure 3 , below , shows @xmath77 , the cumulative distribution of @xmath78 of the brighter pair member , for the case @xmath79 .",
    "editor : please place fig . 2 here",
    "after two images of a background bulge star lensed by sgr a * have been identified , monitoring them could reveal short microlensing events due to one of the cluster black holes passing near one of the images . if the typical cluster black hole has a mass comparable to the masses inferred from x - ray binary systems , @xmath80 m@xmath81(bailyn et al .",
    "1998 ) , the mass ratio of the binary lens of sgr a * and the cluster black hole is @xmath82 . the lightcurves would be similar to those caused by planets around ordinary stars ( mao & paczyski 1991 ; gould & loeb 1992 ; albrow et al .",
    "1998 ) , although with longer timescales . in this section",
    ", we calculate the rate at which these planet - like events should take place .",
    "the rate of microlensing due to cluster black holes depends on their surface density , their velocity distribution , and a _ linear cross section _ giving the size of the region around an unperturbed image where a cluster black hole will significantly change its magnification .",
    "we obtain the surface density of black holes , @xmath83 ( where @xmath84 is the projected radius ) , using the model in mg , where the cluster density varies as @xmath85 , the total stellar mass enclosed within @xmath86 pc is equal to @xmath87 m@xmath81 , and the density normalization of the black hole cluster is reduced by a factor @xmath88 below that of the cluster of stars , owing to the change in the mean mass of the objects between the black hole cluster @xmath89 at @xmath90 pc and the stellar cluster at larger distances @xmath91 . at projected radii @xmath92 pc , the result is @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the angular distance from the center .",
    "we note here that the reduction factor @xmath88 probably gives us an underestimate of the surface density of lensing objects , because the time necessary for the black hole cluster to expand and achieve equilibrium under relaxation with the low - mass stars is somewhat longer than the age of the universe ( this was not taken into account in mg ) .",
    "this means that the rate of events we will find may be underestimated , proportionally to the surface density .",
    "this issue will be addressed in a future paper .",
    "we assume an isotropic velocity distribution . for @xmath95 , the jeans equation",
    "( see binney & tremaine 1987 ) yields a one - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the circular velocity .",
    "the projected two - dimensional velocity dispersion is @xmath98 .",
    "we calculate the linear cross section assuming a chang - refsdal lens ( chang & refsdal 1979 ; schneider , ehlers & falco 1992 ) , of a point mass in the external shear @xmath99 caused by sgr a * , where @xmath100 is the angular distance from the image to sgr a*. we first consider events on the brighter member of the unperturbed pair , with unperturbed magnification @xmath101 given by equation ( 2 ) .",
    "we will later include the contribution from the fainter images .",
    "our criterion for the detectability of the short microlensing event is that the magnification of this image is increased to at least @xmath102 .",
    "if @xmath103 is the axis joining sgr a * and the cluster black hole , and @xmath104 the perpendicular axis , we find that the contours of constant @xmath105 in the source plane have lengths along the @xmath106 axes of @xmath107 where @xmath108 we first consider the case @xmath109 , which corresponds to requiring a caustic crossing ( i.e. , @xmath110 )",
    ".    to compute the rate of events , we notice first that the surface density of caustics in the source plane is @xmath111 , and the velocity dispersion of these caustics is anisotropic . to render the calculation more transparent , it is convenient to make a linear transformation of the source plane to @xmath112 , and @xmath113 ( this transformation would be locally equivalent to the lens plane in the absence of the perturbing black hole ) . in this transformed source plane ,",
    "the surface density and velocity dispersion of the caustics are the same as the surface density and velocity dispersion of the black holes in the lens plane , and the dimensions of contours of constant @xmath105 are modified to @xmath114 , @xmath115 .",
    "the rate of events for a given unperturbed image is just the product @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the average length of the @xmath105 contour over all possible directions of motion of the black hole , and where @xmath118 and @xmath119 are evaluated at the projected radius of the brighter unperturbed image , @xmath120 . in the case",
    "@xmath121 , @xmath122 can be evaluated by noticing that , because the shape of the caustic is always concave between cusps , the cross section for any angle of motion is determined solely by the position of the four cusps .",
    "if @xmath123 is the angle of the motion relative to the @xmath124 axis , the cross section is @xmath125 for @xmath126 , and @xmath127 for @xmath128 , where @xmath129 .",
    "hence , @xmath130 this yields an event rate @xmath131 for a bulge star at @xmath68=500 pc ( i.e. , @xmath132 ) , a shear of @xmath78=0.6 ( i.e. , impact parameter @xmath133=0.52 , @xmath134=1.56 ) , this implies approximately 0.01 microlensing events per year on the brighter image . if a very highly magnified pair of images is found , the rate of events is enhanced .",
    "for example , for @xmath135 , when the brighter image has an unperturbed magnification of 17 , the rate is enhanced to @xmath136 events per year ( an event like this would last for 2 months , while the total sgr a * event has an einstein radius crossing time of 100 years ) .",
    "we can now compute the rate of events as a function of @xmath78 , by multiplying the mean number of images lensed by sgr a * ( which is shown as the solid lines in figure 2 ) times the event rate on a given image from equation ( [ rateim ] ) .",
    "the result is shown as the dashed line in figure 2 .",
    "the cumulative event rate is shown in the left hand panel of figure 3 as the dashed curve .",
    "a large fraction of the mean rate of events occur on high magnification images .",
    "the mean rate of events ( integrated over @xmath78 ) is ( 0.012 , 0.021 , 0.034 ) yr@xmath137 , for @xmath138=(21 , 22 , 23 ) , respectively .",
    "however , the actual expected rate depends strongly on whether images of high @xmath78 ( lensed by sgr a * ) are found .",
    "for example , the expected number of lensed images for @xmath139 is 8 , of which an average of 1 has @xmath140 , and two thirds of the stellar black hole events are contributed by images with @xmath140 .",
    "editor : please place fig .",
    "3 here    so far , we have calculated only the rate of _",
    "caustic crossing _ microlensing events .",
    "in fact , many events can be detected that do not cross the caustic , although as we discuss in   4 , the interpretation of these may be more difficult .",
    "the precise requirement for detection will depend on the precision with which the flux from these faint images could be monitored . for illustration , the dotted line in figure 4 shows the rate of events @xmath141 for @xmath142 ( i.e. , when the unperturbed image is required to be magnified by a factor of at least 2 relative to its magnification due to sgr a * only ) , compared to @xmath121 , for @xmath139 .",
    "the total rates are almost doubled , to ( 0.022 , 0.038 , 0.062 ) yr@xmath137 , for @xmath138=(21 , 22 , 23 ) .    editor",
    ": please place fig .",
    "4 here    the characteristic timescale of the events is @xmath143 , so for caustic crossing we obtain @xmath144 with @xmath145 and @xmath146 , this gives an event duration of @xmath71 2 weeks .",
    "high magnification events last longer , taking @xmath71 2 months to complete a @xmath78 = 0.97 event .",
    "the chang - refsdal approximation used here is potentially subject to severe problems when approaching the limit of very high magnifications ( @xmath147 1 ) .",
    "this is because there is a point where the caustics become so large that they begin to overlap , so that we reach the `` optically thick '' lensing regime in which several cluster black holes are significantly affecting the magnification of the unperturbed image at the same time .",
    "also the caustics weaken in this regime , so that when the finite size of the source is taken into account , the caustic crossing may be difficult to detect .",
    "we estimate this to happen at @xmath148 0.98 ( at which @xmath149 0.1 ) . the vertical dotted line in the left hand panel of figure 3 marks this point , beyond which the contribution to the rate is only @xmath71 8% of the total .",
    "while images of background sources highly magnified by sgr a * are easier to identify , the interpretation of microlensing events on such images gets complicated because of the merging of separated caustics .",
    "hence it is desirable to wait for the identification of a lensed image pair and then , if the corresponding shear is in this regime , work the actual case through more carefully .    in our calculation of the rate of events we have",
    "so far considered only the brighter image of each pair of stars lensed by sgr a*. figure 2 shows that high magnification pairs , though rare , dominate the rate of microlensing events .",
    "one can see from figure 3 that approximately 50% of the total rate comes from images with @xmath150 , for which the ratio of their magnifications to that of their corresponding fainter images is @xmath151 1.56 .",
    "thus , the events on the fainter image should be of comparable importance . the precise calculation of the cross section for the fainter images is more difficult because the caustics have a different morphology for @xmath152 ( two triangles ) than for @xmath153 ( one quadrilateral )",
    ". however , for @xmath147 1 ( which is of relevance here ) , the combined cross section of the two triangles is very well approximated by that of a single quadrilateral with total extent equal to that of the two triangles ( see schneider , ehlers , and falco , 1992 , p.  259 ) .",
    "we therefore calculate the rate using this approximation and find , for events on the fainter images , ( 0.008,0.015,0.024 ) yr@xmath137 , for @xmath138=(21,22,23 ) respectively .",
    "we show the result for @xmath138=23 in the right panel of figure 3 .",
    "the stellar black holes have masses much smaller than that of sgr a * , and so are formally identical to planetary lenses . in the case of planetary systems ,",
    "the orbital velocity of the planet is usually negligible compared to the relative velocity of the lens and the source , and so the mass ratio can be determined from the lightcurve alone by measuring the ratio of timescales of the planetary perturbation and the entire event ( gould & loeb 1992 ) . however , in the present case the orbiting black holes have speeds that are the same order or larger than the sources being lensed .",
    "it is nevertheless often possible to recover the black - hole mass . for caustic - crossing events ,",
    "this can be done just from photometry . in principle ,",
    "the black - hole mass can also be recovered astrometrically , both for caustic - crossing and non - caustic crossing events . however , for non - caustic crossers , this determination will prove difficult in practice .",
    "first , note that the normalized lens - source separation , @xmath133 , can be determined either from the flux ratio @xmath154 of the two images , @xmath155 , or from the measured fractional offset @xmath156 of sgr a * from the midpoint of the two images , @xmath157 .",
    "one can then determine the einstein radius , @xmath158 , or @xmath159 .",
    "from the known mass of sgr a * , this then determines the distance to the source .",
    "next , the shear @xmath160 or @xmath161 determines the geometry of the chang - refsdal lens , up to an overall scale factor @xmath162 ( proportional to the size of the caustic ) .",
    "the source speed is known from the proper motion of the major image across the sky , thus , the only two unknowns are the velocity of the lens ( which determines how fast the caustic moves over the source ) , and the size of the caustic , related to the mass of the lens .",
    "measuring the mass of the lens is the crucial step required to prove that a microlensing event is caused by a stellar black hole .",
    "if the source passes through the caustic , then its trajectory can be determined from the photometric light curve .",
    "this will be much easier for black - hole caustics than for caustics that have been analyzed in binary - lens events to date ( e.g. , afonso et al .",
    "2000 ) , because , as mentioned above , the geometry of the caustic is already known up to a scale factor @xmath162 .",
    "the ratio of the angular size of the caustic to the angular radius of the source can then be determined from the duration of the caustic crossing ( e.g. , afonso et al .",
    "2000 ; albrow et al .  1999 , 2000 , 2001 ) . if the dereddened color and magnitude of the source is measured ( e.g. , from @xmath163 photometry ) , then the angular size of the source can be determined from the color / surface - brightness relation ( e.g. , van belle 1999 ) .",
    "even with just @xmath164 photometry , a good estimate can be made because , for fixed apparent color and magnitude , the inferred source size depends only weakly on the reddening .",
    "it may not be possible to obtain @xmath19 photometry for these very faint stars ; however , the sources at the faint magnitudes at which we expect to find lenses should be main - sequence stars , and since their distance will be known , it should be possible to estimate their angular size even with only the @xmath14 magnitude .",
    "finally , since @xmath78 is known , the ratio of the angular size of the caustic to @xmath51 immediately gives the mass ratio , @xmath165 .",
    "astrometry provides an independent method to determine @xmath165 for both caustic and non - caustic crossing events . for fixed source trajectory through this geometry ,",
    "the astrometric deviation is proportional to @xmath166 .",
    "hence , if this trajectory were known , then measurement of the astrometric deviation would yield @xmath165 .    as discussed above ,",
    "if the source passes through the caustic , then the trajectory can be easily determined from the photometric light curve alone . however , if the source passes outside a cusp , the photometric light curve is potentially subject to two interpretations : the approached cusp could be along the sgr - a*/black - hole axis , or perpendicular to it .",
    "these two cases are nevertheless easily resolved astrometrically since the two astrometric deviations are at right angles to one another .",
    "once it is resolved , one knows from the height of the photometric peak of the deviation , how close the source was to the cusp when it crossed the cusp axis .",
    "the astrometric deviation at this point then gives @xmath165 .",
    "for caustic - crossing events the astrometric deviation is of order @xmath167 .",
    "recall that just to resolve the imaged stars requires _ resolution _",
    "@xmath168 , so _",
    "centroiding _ the images to sub - mas levels should be challenging but perhaps feasible .",
    "however , in the limit of @xmath169 ( which dominates the expected distribution of lenses shown in fig .",
    "2 ) , the maximum astrometric deviation is @xmath170 .",
    "this factor @xmath171 reduction relative to the caustic - crossing case could render an already difficult measurement impossible .",
    "we have shown that a pair of lensed images from a background bulge star is likely to be found by the time stars are imaged down to @xmath172 within an arc second of sgr a * , and about 8 pairs are expected if @xmath173 is reached .",
    "these images will need to be distinguished from the much more numerous stars in the vicinity of sgr a * by finding a pair of images with the correct relations between magnifications , positions and proper motions expected for a point mass lens .",
    "the detection of these lenses would show that sgr a * is concentrated within a radius @xmath174 , but this has already been demonstrated at much smaller radii by the direct measurement of stellar accelerations ( ghez et al .",
    "a much more interesting application would be to test the predicted presence of a cluster of stellar black holes around sgr a*. unfortunately , we find that these events should be quite rare : only about one caustic - crossing event per century for every lensed image that is monitored . however , this rate would be enhanced if a pair of highly magnified images were found .",
    "if an event is detected toward the black - hole cluster , it need not necessarily be due to a black hole : there will also be events in this direction caused by ordinary stars around the black - hole cluster . assuming a core radius of @xmath175pc for the old population of low - mass stars ( caused by scatterings from the cluster black holes ) , the surface mass density of these stars is a factor @xmath176 smaller than that of the black holes .",
    "the duration of these events due to old stars would be similar to the ones from the cluster black holes , since the lower masses are roughly compensated by the lower velocity dispersion .",
    "however , as discussed in ",
    "4 , they could be distinguished by photometric monitoring of a caustic crossing and/or astrometrically .",
    "alexander & loeb ( 2001 ) have also investigated microlensing by stellar objects near sgr a*. in their case , they consider background disk stars as sources ( whereas we have considered bulge stars ) , and they assume that a population of @xmath177 stars surrounds sgr a * , with a density profile @xmath178 .",
    "they discuss the increased likelihood to observe a star with high magnification when considering the microlensing by stellar objects near the einstein radius of sgr a*.    we note that more microlensing events by cluster black holes might be found by monitoring to the same depth all the stars over the entire area of the black hole cluster , within @xmath179 of sgr a*. in this case , we would not know a priori which of the source stars are at a large distance behind the gc , and the magnification by sgr a * would be negligible . the events from the cluster black holes would tend to have einstein timescales @xmath180 that were @xmath181 times longer than those of ordinary bulge events ( since , far away from sgr a * , the velocities of the black holes are similar to those of other bulge stars ) .",
    "they could not be unambiguously distinguished on the basis of timescales alone because the full - width at half - maximum of the mass estimate is almost a factor 100 ( gould 2000 ) .",
    "however , since most of this width is due to the large dispersion in proper motions @xmath182 , it could largely be removed by measuring the astrometric deviation , which yields the einstein radius @xmath51 , and so @xmath183 .",
    "since the surface density of black holes is @xmath184 , and their velocity dispersion @xmath185 , the number of microlensing events they produce within @xmath186 is proportional to @xmath187 , so there should be about 10 times more events from the entire cluster , within @xmath188 , than events that are affected by the magnification of sgr a*.    finally , we point out a very interesting additional application of the lensed pairs that we predict should be found at any detection limit : they are potentially powerful probes of the extinction immediately behind the gc , which is the difference between the extinction toward the source , and the extinction toward gc sources along the same line of sight as the images . as we discuss immediately below ,",
    "the former can be determined by obtaining multi - color photometry of both images and spectroscopy of the brighter one .",
    "the latter can be found from the distribution of colors and magnitudes of sources along lines of sight neighboring the images , the great majority of which lie within @xmath189 1 pc of the gc .",
    "recall from   4 , that @xmath51 can be determined from the measured image positions , which implies that @xmath68 , the source distance behind the gc , is known from equation ( [ eqn : thetaeofd ] ) .",
    "to accurately measure the extinction to the source , its intrinsic color must be determined .",
    "this can best be done by spectroscopy of the brighter image .",
    "a large fraction of the lensed sources have small @xmath78 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , and so consist of a luminous source whose brighter image is weakly magnified , and whose fainter image is heavily demagnified .",
    "hence the brighter image must have @xmath190 .",
    "thus , these low-@xmath78 image pairs , which contribute almost nothing to the probability of detecting cluster black holes , are the best probes of extinction .",
    "see figure 1 for the overall distribution of brighter images . for cases where the brighter image is sufficiently faint ,",
    "spectroscopy will no longer be possible , and it will be necessary to determine the intrinsic color from multi - color photometry .",
    "this will be less accurate , but probably still useful .",
    "of course , once the intrinsic color of the source is known from measurements of the brighter image , extinction can be measured along _ both _ lines of sight to the source , by measuring the apparent colors of both images .",
