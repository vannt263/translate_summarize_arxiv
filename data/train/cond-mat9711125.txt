    "the discovery of high temperature superconductivity in copper oxide materials generated considerable effort to find simple electronic models that exhibit a superconducting phase . since the mechanism for superconductivity is believed to lie within the cuo@xmath4 planes , a variety of two - dimensional models",
    "have been proposed , the three principal ones being the ( one - band ) hubbard , three - band hubbard , and t - j models .",
    "unfortunately , conclusive evidence for a superconducting phase has not been found in any of these models .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we will report the results of a quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) study of the three - band hubbard model .",
    "of the three models , it has been less intensively studied , partially because of the general belief that its low energy excitation spectrum is similar to the other two . indeed in the strong coupling limit ,",
    "both the one - band and three - band hubbard models have the t - j model as an approximate limit .",
    "however , there still remains some controversy on whether one - band models , like the hubbard and t - j models , are adequate to describe the low energy physical properties of the cuprate superconductors .",
    "one of our objectives is to study the possible existence of superconductivity in the three - band model in regions where model parameters are physical as opposed to regions where asymptotic models are clearly more appropriate .",
    "the most solid information about possible superconductivity in the one - band hubbard model has come from a series of qmc calculations .",
    "for instance , using a finite temperature qmc method , white et al .",
    "@xcite studied possible superconductivity in the hubbard model .",
    "they found an attractive effective pairing interaction in the @xmath5 and extended s - wave channels .",
    "moreo and scalapino @xcite subsequently found pairing correlations but also found that they did not increase when the lattice size was increased .",
    "their result , suggesting the absence of long range order , was consistent with an earlier qmc study by imada and hatsugai.@xcite    the results of almost all qmc calculations of the hubbard model however , are limited by the fermion sign problem to high temperatures and small system sizes .",
    "these limitations had left open the possibility that superconductivity still lurked at larger systems and lower temperatures .",
    "recently , a new qmc method , the constrained path monte carlo ( cpmc ) method,@xcite was developed to get around the sign problem . using this method , zhang et al .",
    "@xcite calculated ground - state pairing correlation functions for the hubbard model as a function of the distance and found that as the system size or the interaction strength is increased the magnitude of the long - range part of the pairing correlation functions vanished for both the @xmath5 and extended s - wave channels . although this method produces a variational solution , its results , together with the null results from previous qmc studies , are very discouraging for finding superconductivity in the one - band hubbard model .",
    "past numerical work on the three - band model , has been less definitive about the existence of superconductivity .",
    "the work has mainly consisted of exact diagonalization computations @xcite@xmath6@xcite , where calculations of hole binding energies was emphasized , and qmc computations @xcite@xmath6",
    "@xcite where magnetic and pairing calculations were emphasized .",
    "the exact diagonalization studies unequivocally established that holes can bind . in",
    "a number of cases binding only occurred for unphysical parameter ranges , and because of small systems sizes , the existence and symmetry of the pairing was difficult to access .",
    "the qmc studies , probably even more limited by the sign problem than those for the one - band model , established the existence of an extended s - wave and @xmath7 wave attractive pairing interaction .",
    "however , none of these qmc studies reported the behavior of the pairing correlation functions at large distances , which is the relevant quantity to establish the existence of long range order .    in the work reported here , we removed the limitations caused by the sign problem by applying the cpmc method to the three - band hubbard model .",
    "we computed the binding energy for holes near half - filling for systems up to @xmath0 unit cells .",
    "we found a wide range of physically relevant parameters for which the holes bind .",
    "as will be reported in more detail , we found that larger systems in fact make hole binding easier .",
    "we also find that the inclusion of the nearest neighbors coulomb repulsion @xmath8 is not necessary for binding as was concluded in several of the exact diagonalization studies .",
    "for similar systems sizes as the previous simulations , but at zero temperature , we looked at the pairing correlation functions _ as a function of distance _ and found that the pairing correlation functions decay quickly with distance and are suppressed with increasing lattice size and @xmath2 .",
    "the extended s - wave channel is much more strongly suppressed than the @xmath3 channel .",
    "these trends are similar to those found in qmc simulations of the one - band model .",
    "the remainder of our report is organized as follows : in section [ hamilton ] we define the hamiltonian and the physical quantities calculated and discuss the choice of model parameters . in section [ cpmc ] we briefly describe the cpmc method , and then in section [ results ] we present the results for both the binding energy for holes and the pairing correlation functions . finally in section [ conclusions ] , we discuss in detail our main conclusions .",
    "as proposed by emery,@xcite the three - band model physically mimics the cuo@xmath4 layer by having one cu and two o atoms per unit cell , with the cu atoms arranged on a square lattice and the o atoms centered on the edges of the square unit cells . in this layer",
    ", emery assumed that the relevant orbitals are just those of copper @xmath9 and oxygen @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the hamiltonian has the form :    @xmath12    in writing the hamiltonian , we adopted the convention that the operator @xmath13 creates a _ hole _ at a cu @xmath14 orbital and @xmath15 creates a _ hole _ in an o @xmath16 or @xmath11 orbital . @xmath2 and @xmath17 are the coulomb repulsions at the cu and o sites respectively , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the corresponding orbital energies , and @xmath8 is the nearest neighbor coulomb repulsion . as written , the model has a cu - o hybridization @xmath20 with the minus sign occurring @xmath21 and @xmath22 and also hybridizaton @xmath23 between oxygen sites with the minus sign occurring for @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "these phase conventions are illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "the system is said to be half - filled when there is one hole per cu site . at half - filling , for a wide range of parameters ,",
    "its ground - state is an anti - ferromagnetic insulator just like the one - band hubbard model .",
    "its insulating gap , however , is a charge transfer one in contrast with the gap in the the one - band model which is a mott - hubbard gap .",
    "the values of the parameters in the hamiltonian have been estimated by a number of different constrained density functional and quantum cluster calculations.@xcite@xmath26@xcite taken together , these estimates define a reasonably limited range of the parameters for the which the model might be labeled as `` physical . '' .",
    "we use table  i of ref 20 , which summarizes results from density functional and cluster calculations , as the principal guideline for the parameter range we explored .",
    "the cu site coulomb repulsion @xmath2 is large , making doubly occupancy of cu sites by two holes very unfavorable .",
    "the next largest parameter , the charge transfer energy @xmath27 , plays a special role . depending on the relative values of @xmath28 , @xmath2 and the bandwidth @xmath29",
    "the system can be classified in different regimes .@xcite estimates place the cuprate superconductors in the charge transfer regime , in which @xmath30 .",
    "the remaining parameters are relatively comparable in magnitude .",
    "the role of the cu - o hybridization @xmath31 is also special .",
    "this hybdization , through the super - exchange mechanism , generates an anti - ferromagnetic exchange interaction between the spins in the cu sites .    if @xmath32 , the three - band model maps into a one - band model with @xmath33 and @xmath34 . for @xmath35 ,",
    "the one - band model can in turn be mapped into the t - j model with @xmath36 .",
    "zhang and rice @xcite have argued that the t - j model can also be appropriate when @xmath37 and @xmath38 . in real materials , @xmath39 is estimated to be @xmath40 .@xcite therefore , besides the lack of conclusive evidence that the one - band model superconducts , it is also unclear that the mapping among the most studied models is appropriate for physical values of the parameters . in this paper",
    "we will examine the three - band model in the estimated range of parameters to detail the behavior of the model in its own right .    in what follows we scale all the energies by @xmath31 .",
    "we take @xmath41 since it is small ( @xmath42 @xcite ) .",
    "this assumption simplifies the numerical algorithm significantly and reduces the computational time by at least a factor of four .    with the numerical method used",
    ", a variety of expectation values can be computed .",
    "we focused on two key quantities : the binding energy for doped holes and the pairing correlation functions as a function of the distance .",
    "the binding energy is defined as : @xmath43 with @xmath44 the ground - state energy for n doped holes , where @xmath45 corresponds to the undoped ( half - filled ) case .",
    "if negative , this parameter indicates that it costs less to dope a second hole in the vicinity of the first hole than it does to create two isolated holes . in the thermodynamic limit @xmath46",
    "is expected to be the binding energy of a copper pair .",
    "we calculated @xmath46 for systems with @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath0 unit cells .",
    "we are unaware of any previous quantum monte carlo calculations of binding energy for the three - band model .",
    "we also computed the extended s - wave and the @xmath7 pairing correlation functions : @xmath49 where @xmath50 & \\\\ &                                                              + [ p^x_{\\vec{r }   \\uparrow}p^x_{\\vec{r}+\\vec{\\delta } \\downarrow } - p^x_{\\vec{r}\\downarrow}p^x_{\\vec{r}+\\vec{\\delta }    \\uparrow } ] + [ p^y_{\\vec{r }   \\uparrow}p^y_{\\vec{r}+\\vec{\\delta } \\downarrow } - p^y_{\\vec{r}\\downarrow}p^y_{\\vec{r}+\\vec{\\delta }    \\uparrow } ] \\ } &   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath51 . for",
    "extended s - wave pairing @xmath52 for all @xmath53 and for the @xmath5 pairing , @xmath54 for @xmath55 and @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "here @xmath58 denotes the distance between unit cells ( taken from copper ion to copper ion ) .",
    "we will directly report these correlations functions as a function of @xmath58 .",
    "we will not report its @xmath59 spatial fourier transformation and partial sums like @xmath60 as it has been done in previous works @xcite@xmath6@xcite , because the magnitude of these quantities are dominated by a large peak in @xmath61 when @xmath58 is less than a few nearest neighbor distances . over these distances ,",
    "@xmath62 measures local correlations among spin and charge fluctuations and has little information about long - range pairing correlations . in certain cases ,",
    "we will also report the `` vertex contribution '' to the correlation functions ( see , for example , white et . al @xcite ) defined as follows : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the contribution of two dressed non - interacting propagators . for each term in @xmath65 of the form @xmath66",
    ", @xmath64 has a term like @xmath67 .",
    "we find that the conclusions remain the same no matter which quantity we look at .",
    "our numerical method is extensively described and benchmarked elsewhere.@xcite here we only discuss its basic approximation . in the cpmc method ,",
    "the ground - state wave function @xmath68 is projected from a known initial wave function @xmath69 by a branching random walk in an over - complete space of slater determinants @xmath70 .",
    "in such a space , we can write @xmath71 . the random walk produces an ensemble of @xmath70 , called random walkers , which represent @xmath68 in the sense that their distribution is a monte carlo sampling of @xmath72 , that is , a sampling of the ground - state wave function .    to completely specify the ground - state wave function ,",
    "only determinants satisfying @xmath73 are needed because @xmath68 resides in either of two degenerate halves of the slater determinant space , separated by a nodal plane @xmath74 that is defined by @xmath75 .",
    "the sign problem occurs because walkers can cross @xmath74 as their orbitals evolve continuously in the random walk .",
    "asymptotically they populate the two halves equally , leading to an ensemble that has zero overlap with @xmath68 .",
    "if @xmath74 were known , we would simply constrain the random walk to one half of the space and obtain an exact solution of schrdinger s equation . in the constrained - path qmc method , without _ a priori _ knowledge of @xmath74 , we use a trial wave function @xmath69 and require @xmath76 .",
    "the random walk again solves schrdinger s equation in determinant space , but under an approximate boundary - condition .",
    "this is what is called the constrained - path approximation .",
    "the ground - state energy computed by the cpmc method is an upper bound .",
    "the quality of the calculation clearly depends on the trial wave function @xmath69 .",
    "since the constraint only involves the overall sign of its overlap with any determinant @xmath70 , it seems reasonable to expect the results to show some insensitivity to @xmath69 . through extensive benchmarking on the hubbard model",
    ", it has been found that simple choices of this function can give very good results.@xcite    besides as starting point and as a condition constraining a random walker , we also use @xmath69 as an importance function .",
    "specifically we use @xmath77 to bias the random walk into those parts of slater determinant space that have a large overlap with the trial state .",
    "for all three uses of @xmath69 , it clearly is advantageous to have @xmath69 approximate @xmath68 as closely as possible . only in the constraining of the path",
    "does @xmath78 generate an approximation .",
    "all the calculations reported here are done with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "mostly , we study closed shell cases , for which the corresponding free - electron wave function is non - degenerate and is translationally invariant . in these cases ,",
    "the free - electron wave function , represented by a single slater determinant , is used as the trial wave function @xmath79 .",
    "( the use of an unrestricted hartree - fock wave function as @xmath79 produced no significant improvement in the results ) .    however , to calculate the binding energy for holes , we need to study the half filled case and then the 1 and 2 hole doped cases . in the systems considered ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath0 unit cells ) the 2 hole doped case corresponds to a closed shell case .",
    "the one hole doped case is a closed shell minus one hole .",
    "this missing hole can be put in either of two degenerate orbitals corresponding to @xmath80 or @xmath81 .",
    "the trial wave function , constructed by putting the hole in either of these orbitals or a linear combination of them , give equally good results so we pick an arbitrary linear combination of them .",
    "for the half - filled case , the free electron wave function is 4-fold degenerate : @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the closed shell state with two holes below half - filling . in the @xmath47 system",
    "the state @xmath86 has 2 holes , in the @xmath48 system , it has 6 holes and in the @xmath0 system it has 22 holes . if we just arbitrarily pick one of these states , the energy has a significant difference .",
    "for example , in the @xmath47 system it is of the order of @xmath87 from the exact diagonalization result .",
    "to accurately compute the binding energy , this difference is too big .",
    "therefore , we used the following procedure : we diagonalize the interacting part of the hamiltonian in this degenerate subspace , and obtained 2 states with energy proportional to @xmath2 and 2 states with zero energy .",
    "of the 2 states with zero energy only one of them is a singlet .",
    "we used this state .",
    "it is represented by two slater determinants : @xmath88 . in table 1 , for a @xmath47 system with @xmath89 and @xmath90 , we compare the energies obtained using the cpmc with the one and two slater determinants trial wave function and energies obtained from exact diagonalization .",
    "we see that using two slater determinants improves the accuracy by an order of magnitude or more .",
    "the accuracy has become better than the closed shell case .    in a typical run for a large system we set the average number of walkers to 600 and the time step to 0.03 .",
    "we perform 3000 steps before we start taking measurements and we do the measurements in 40 blocks of 500 steps each to ensure statistical independence .",
    "shell structures are characteristic of finite - sized systems of electrons . in our simulations",
    "these effects are most clearly seen in the values of the energy and chemical potential as a function of the hole density @xmath91 , with @xmath92 the number of unit cells .",
    "a shell structure is perhaps most easily illustrated by first considering the non - interacting problem .",
    "there , holes are added to the system at the same energy until all the degenerate states of a given shell are occupied and paired , that is , until the shell is closed . as an `` open '' shell",
    "is filled , the total energy of the system varies linearly with the doping and within a shell the chemical potential thus is a constant .",
    "the number of states in a shell is twice the order of the point group relating the wave vectors of the degenerate states . between shells",
    "the chemical potential is discontinuous .",
    "this `` gap '' is a finite size effect .    in the interacting problem",
    "the energy and chemical potential shows a similar behavior . the number of states in a shell and the shell boundaries are the same as the non - interacting problem for the range of interactions we examined . for a @xmath93 system , a typical shell structure for the three - band model as a function of @xmath2",
    "is illustrated in figs .",
    "2a and 2b were we show the ground state energy @xmath94 and the chemical potential @xmath95 as a function of the hole density for @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "for our finite system we defined @xmath98 which is the discrete version of the usual definition @xmath99 .",
    "the @xmath100 case is the non - interacting case .",
    "its shell structure is most evident in the chemical potential , fig .",
    "a comparison of the non - interacting case with the interacting cases does show several differences . at half - filling ,",
    "@xmath101 , the chemical potential in the interacting cases shows a jump whereas the non - interacting case does not .",
    "this jump is not a finite - size effect but is the charge - transfer gap induced by the interaction . within a shell",
    "the chemical potential of the interacting cases are varying weakly but approximately linearly with doping .",
    "this variation is similar to the behavior of the one - band hubbard model@xcite , but there , to an excellent approximation , within a shell the energy for the interacting cases varies linearly with doping and hence within a shell the chemical potential is a constant . in fig .",
    "2a , one sees that the energy versus doping curve has a minimum whose location varies as a function of @xmath2 . as @xmath2 increases this location shifts from the fully doped position towards the half - filled position .",
    "the one - band hubbard model displays similar doping and interaction dependencies .",
    "@xcite      we calculated the binding energy @xmath46 for holes for systems with @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 unit cells .",
    "a value of @xmath105 indicates hole binding whereas a value of @xmath106 implies hole repulsion .",
    "it is important to note that studying systems larger than @xmath102 is essential for the doping @xmath107 to have values similar to those for which the real materials superconduct : for @xmath102 unit cells with one hole , @xmath108 , and with 2 holes , @xmath109 , values which are outside the physically interesting region . on the other hand , for one and two holes the @xmath103 case has @xmath110 and @xmath111 while the @xmath104 case has @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "these values of doping span the range observed in the real materials .",
    "shown in fig .",
    "3 , to benchmark the accuracy of our results , is a comparison of our binding energies with those of exact diagonalization .",
    "specifically , we plotted @xmath46 as a function of @xmath2 for @xmath102 systems with @xmath114 and @xmath115 and 3 and found good agreement with exact diagonalization results , especially for the @xmath116 case .",
    "for @xmath96 the differences are more pronounced but are still only of the order of @xmath117 . as a general trend ,",
    "we slightly _ underestimate _ the binding energy .",
    "this figure is representative of our systematic error in the estimation of the binding energy .    in fig .",
    "4 we present results for @xmath103 systems as function of @xmath28 as function of two values of @xmath2 . for @xmath118",
    "we find that @xmath46 decreases monotonically with @xmath28 but for @xmath119 it has a shallow minimum at @xmath120 .",
    "such a minimum means that there is a broad range of @xmath28 for which the binding energy does not change significantly .",
    "the existence of such a minimum , occurring at approximately the same value of @xmath28 , was observed in the exact diagonalization studies of ogata and shiba@xcite and commented upon by martin.@xcite in general holes bind provided @xmath28 is below some threshold value . in what follows",
    ", we set @xmath96 which is a value consistent with the values obtained by lda and cluster calculations @xcite and is also near the optimal value for binding .    in fig .  5",
    ", we compare @xmath46 for different systems sizes as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "we find that the binding energy tends to saturate as @xmath2 is increased .",
    "the saturation is consistent with the exact diagonalization studies of ogata and shiba@xcite and of stephan et al .",
    "@xcite the binding energy tends to increase as the system size is increased . over",
    "the range of system sizes studied , the dependence of @xmath46 on system size was not systematic enough to allow us to extrapolate to infinite system sizes . in general @xmath121 .",
    "we also studied the effect of @xmath17 and @xmath122 on @xmath46 . in fig .",
    "6 we plot @xmath46 as a function of @xmath2 for @xmath123 and @xmath124 . in fig .",
    "6a , we see that in the @xmath102 system a small value of @xmath17 destroys the binding as previously reported by hirsch et al.@xcite however , in the larger @xmath103 system ( fig .",
    "6b ) , the holes still bind with @xmath125 , although the binding energy is smaller , confirming a speculation of hirsch et al . that the negative effect of @xmath17 on the binding might decrease as the system size increases .",
    "a similar effect is seen when we plot @xmath46 versus @xmath122 for @xmath102 and @xmath103 systems with @xmath126 , @xmath96 and @xmath127 ( fig .",
    "the ability to bind decreases nearly linearly with @xmath122 but in the larger systems it decreases more slowly , so that there is still binding for @xmath128 .",
    "therefore , the effect of the coulomb repulsion on the o sites and hopping between them in reducing the binding is diminished for larger system sizes .",
    "in contrast to the position emphasized by hirsch et al.@xcite and by stephan et al.,@xcite the physical presence of a non - zero @xmath122 and @xmath17 , while reducing the ability to bind , does not necessarily mean that an unphysically large cu - o coulomb repulsion @xmath8 is essential for hole binding .",
    "their conclusions were influenced by the small system sizes they were able to study .",
    "while the binding of two holes in the physically relevant range of parameters is encouraging for superconductivity , perhaps a more central question now is what happens when a third hole is added .",
    "do the three holes cluster or does the third hole sit apart from the pair ?",
    "we do not examine these questions directly .",
    "instead , we calculate the superconducting pairing correlations .      for both the extended s - wave and the @xmath5 channels , we studied the pairing correlation functions as a function of the distance for lattices up to @xmath1 unit cells .",
    "all calculations were done for closed shell cases . for the @xmath129 systems , we put 18 holes ( @xmath110 ) , for the @xmath1 system , 42 holes ( @xmath130 ) , and for @xmath104 , 26 holes ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "the distance is measured between unit cells ( from copper ion to copper ion ) @xcite .    in fig .",
    "8 we present the pairing correlations for the extended s - wave channel of a @xmath131 system with @xmath96 and @xmath128 for different values of the interaction @xmath2 .",
    "the inset magnifies the large distance behavior .",
    "we see that the short - ranged correlations are enhanced with increasing @xmath2 , but decay very quickly when @xmath58 is increased . for large @xmath58",
    "they simply fluctuate around @xmath132 .",
    "for the same parameters , the @xmath5 channel is plotted in fig .",
    ", there is enhancement in the short - ranged part .",
    "then as @xmath58 is increased , there is again a decay , in this case not to zero but to a small positive value .",
    "however , as @xmath2 is increased , this value becomes even smaller .",
    "these results clarify the findings of previous quantum monte carlo simulations .",
    "these previous simulations were limited to relatively high temperatures because of the sign problem .",
    "scalettar and coworkers@xcite found an attractive pairing interaction in both the extended s and the d@xmath133 channels but could not predict which would dominate with the lowering of temperature and increasing of lattice size .",
    "the results of figs .  8 and 9 clearly indicate that the d@xmath133 correlations dominate .",
    "this dominance is in direct opposition to the findings of dopf and coworkers@xcite that the extended s wave channel dominates . by looking at the the zero wave number component of the fourier transform of the pairing correlation function ,",
    "these researchers only observed how the short - ranged correlations behaved and overshadowed the behavior of the longer - ranged correlations .    in several previous quantum monte carlo simulations various researchers found it more convenient to study just the vertex contribution to the pairing correlation function , as defined in section [ hamilton ] . in fig .",
    "10 we plot this contribution to the d@xmath133 correlation function just shown in fig",
    "we see that there is positive contribution which again is enhanced by @xmath2 at short distances but suppressed at larger distances .",
    "thus , as emphasized by zhang et al.,@xcite this function seems to contain no more information about possible long - range order than the full pairing correlation function .    since we restricted ourselves to closed shell cases , it is difficult to do a useful finite - size scaling of our results .",
    "an attempt to show the effect of increasing system size on the correlations is given in fig .",
    "11 where we plot the d@xmath133 vertex contribution for @xmath93 and @xmath131 systems with the same parameters , keeping in mind that the fillings are not the same . at short distances",
    "the correlations are enhanced as the lattice size is increased but for larger distances there is a crossover , and in fact , the vertex contribution is smaller in the @xmath131 system by almost an order of magnitude .",
    "a similar significant reduction is also seen in the long - range parts of the full correlation functions .",
    "we also studied the effect of @xmath28 and @xmath122 on the pairing correlations .",
    "one will recall that increasing @xmath122 weakened pair binding while the binding was optimal for @xmath28 around 2 . in fig .",
    "12 we plot the bare correlation functions for different values of @xmath28 with @xmath134 and @xmath135 for a @xmath104 system with @xmath113 .",
    "we find that the long - range pairing correlations are not optimal when the pair binding is optimal .",
    "in fact , values of @xmath28 less than the optimal value enhance the longer range part of the correlation functions .",
    "a much smaller effect is obtained by changing the value of @xmath122 , as evident in fig .",
    "13 , where the parameters are @xmath126 , @xmath96 and the size is @xmath131 unit cells .",
    "if anything , the larger value of @xmath122 seems to enhance the long - range correlations slightly .",
    "it is interesting that in all cases presented we see a crossover from what happens at short distances to what happens at long distances .",
    "we emphasize that examining quantities that integrate , even partially , the pairing correlation function over distances can produce misleading results .",
    "using a newly developed quantum monte carlo method , the constrained - path method , we simulated the 3-band hubbard model to search for a possible superconducting ground state .",
    "we focused principally on the calculation of the binding energy of a pair of holes and the extended @xmath136 and @xmath7 superconducting pairing correlation functions .",
    "for the pair binding energy , we found that holes bind for a wide physically relevant range of parameters and that the binding increased as the system size is increased .",
    "we also found that when we included a hopping @xmath122 between oxygen sites , the binding decreased roughly linearly with @xmath122 , but in a larger system it decreased much more slowly .",
    "the coulomb repulsion @xmath17 on the oxygen sites was found to suppress the binding , but again for larger systems its effect became less significant .",
    "the increased tendency to bind as the system size is increased seems to diminish the importance of an cu - o coulomb repulsion @xmath8 for holes to bind as suggested in several exact diagonalization studies.@xcite in general , hole binding occurs over a broad range of @xmath28 values centered roughly around two . in this respect",
    "our simulations support the exact diagonalization results of ogata and shiba.@xcite    we calculated the pairing correlation functions for the extended @xmath136 and the @xmath5 channels as a function of the distance .",
    "for the extended s channel , we found that as the coulomb interaction @xmath2 on the cu sites is increased , the long - range part of the correlation functions is suppressed and fluctuates around zero .",
    "for the @xmath3 channel , we found that the correlations decay rapidly with distance towards a small positive value .",
    "however , this value becomes smaller as the interaction @xmath2 or the system size is increased .",
    "the same behavior is observed for the vertex contributions to these correlation functions .",
    "unequivocally , the @xmath7 pairing correlations dominate the extended @xmath136 pairing correlations .",
    "this finding is opposite to that previously emphasized by dopf and coworkers.@xcite    we also studied the effect of the charge transfer energy @xmath28 on the pairing correlation functions and found that smaller values of @xmath28 produce larger correlations .",
    "similarly , we looked at the effect of the hopping @xmath122 between oxygen sites and found that it has a very small effect but that larger values of @xmath122 are slightly more favorable for pairing .",
    "these trends are counter to those that enhance pair binding .",
    "a systematic study of the size dependence of the binding energy and pairing correlation functions was difficult because the way the doping dependence of closed shell changed with changing system sizes .",
    "we did present a comparison of the @xmath7 pairing correlation function for a @xmath93 system and a @xmath131 system .",
    "although the hole doping was slightly different , a significant reduction of both the vertex contribution and the full correlation function was observed in the larger system .",
    "this result suggests that the long - range pairing correlation found are unlikely to persist in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "in general , we found similar trends for the three - band model that were found for the one - band hubbard model.@xcite the additional degrees of freedom in the three - band model do not seem to enhance superconductivity in an obvious way .",
    "one could argue that a cu - o coulomb repulsion @xmath8 is needed ; however , we found that @xmath8 is not necessary to obtain hole binding and speculate that it is unlikely that the addition of such a small parameter to the model would change the picture dramatically .",
    "the question remains , if the holes do bind , that is , a purely electronic mechanism induces an attractive interaction between holes , but this attraction does not lead to electron pairing , what does it , if anything , lead to . does it lead to phase separation or some novel phase , like stripes ?",
    "this question is currently under investigation .",
