    "rare earth ( re ) materials have high magnetic moments and form a wide range of magnetic structures .",
    "it is the occupancy of the highly localised @xmath2-states that determines the magnetic properties while the other electronic properties are determined principally by the itinerant @xmath3 electrons.@xcite the standard method of determining the electronic properties of magnetic materials is density functional theory with a local spin density approximation ( lsd ) for the exchange - correlation energy.@xcite traditionally this method has been applied to the @xmath3 electrons in rare earths while the @xmath1-electrons have been treated in an atomic model .",
    "attempts to include the @xmath2-electrons within the lsd have had only very limited success because the lsd is insufficient to describe the strong correlations experienced by the rare earth @xmath1-electrons . in recent years",
    "more advanced methods of electronic structure determination such as lsd plus self - interaction corrections ( sic)@xcite and lda+u@xcite methods have sought to remedy this problem and have met with considerable success .",
    "currently there is a great deal of interest in spintronics and spin - filtering from both the fundamental and applied point of view .",
    "there has been speculation in the literature that rare earth nitrides may form half - metallic ferromagnets.@xcite this is surprising because , based on a simple ionic model , trivalent rare earth nitrides would be expected to be insulators with a similar electronic structure to the divalent rare earth chalcogenides .",
    "however if it is the case that they are half - metallic then they have potential applications in spintronic devices .",
    "to our knowledge , there has been no systematic study of the electronic structure of these materials at all .",
    "this is particularly surprising given that they all crystallise in the simple sodium chloride structure.@xcite    it is the purpose of this paper to discuss our calculations of the electronic structure of rare earth nitrides and thus to gain a deeper understanding of these materials and their potential applications .",
    "we have performed sic - lsd calculations for all the rare earth nitrides , in the ferromagnetic state , in both the divalent and trivalent states .",
    "thus , in this systematic study of rare earth nitrides we shall be concerned with the nominal valence of the rare earth ion as we progress through the series .",
    "will these materials turn out to be all trivalent ?",
    "what is the character of the rare earth @xmath1 and @xmath4 hybridization with the nitrogen @xmath5 states ? obviously , the position of the empty @xmath1-states will be an important factor in determining this . by performing this systematic study",
    ", we will be able to determine the trends .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "after a brief summary of our calculational method in section ii , in section iii we discuss the detailed electronic structure of these materials , and trends in behaviour as one proceeds across the periodic table .",
    "we conclude the paper in section iv , indicating what our results imply for device applications .",
    "the sic - lsd approximation @xcite is an _ ab - initio _ electronic structure scheme , that is capable of describing localization phenomena in solids.@xcite in this scheme the spurious self - interaction of each occupied state , which is inherent in any local approximation to density functional theory ( dft),@xcite is subtracted from the conventional lsd approximation to the total energy functional @xmath6 where @xmath7 labels the occupied states and @xmath8 is the self - interaction correction for state @xmath7 .",
    "this leads to a greatly improved description of static coulomb correlation effects over the lsd approximation .",
    "demonstrations of the advantages of the sic approach have been made in studies of the hubbard model,@xcite in applications to 3d oxides such as monoxides,@xcite high temperature cuprates,@xcite and magnetite,@xcite to @xmath1-electron systems,@xcite and to solid hydrogen.@xcite    in the sic - lsd method it is necessary to minimise the total energy with respect to the number of localised electrons which also leads to a determination of the nominal valence defined as the integer number of electrons available for band formation @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the atomic number of the rare earth and @xmath11 is the number of atomic core electrons .",
    "@xmath12 is the number of @xmath1-states for which the self - interaction correction has been removed and is determined so that @xmath13 equals 3 for trivalent , and 2 for divalent , systems .",
    "further details of the sic - lsd method are discussed elsewhere.@xcite",
    "we have performed calculations for all the rare earth nitrides in ferromagnetic ordering and both the divalent @xmath14 and trivalent @xmath15 configurations ( and for cen the tetravalent @xmath16 configuration ) , and hence have determined the ground state energy and valence from first principles .",
    "we have found that the ground state for ce in cen is tetravalent while all the other rare earths are trivalent in the nitrides . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we show the difference in energy between the divalent and trivalent states of all the rare earth nitrides .",
    "this follows the expected trend of strongly trivalent state at the start of the series in both spin channels , and a decreasing energy difference between the trivalent and divalent state as the filling of the @xmath1-shell occurs .",
    "however , none of the nitrides attains the divalent state .",
    "furthermore the number of occupied itinerant @xmath1-electron states stays well below the 0.7 required for the materials to become divalent , as observed by strange _",
    "et al._,@xcite because of the strong hybridisation with the nitrogen @xmath5 states .",
    "the lattice constants for the @xmath1 configuration that yields the lowest total energy can be evaluated by looking for the minimum in total energy as a function of lattice size and these are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] along with the experimental values.@xcite the jump in lattice constant between ce and pr is due to the valence change from tetravalent to trivalent . for ce , pr and the heavy rare earths , theory and experiment agree very well both for the absolute values and the trend . for the remaining light rare earths",
    "the absolute agreement is still very good but there is a trend apparent in the theory that is not clear in the experimental results .",
    "the most probable cause of this is experimental uncertainty which can arise in these materials very easily , particularly as many of these measurements were performed at a time when samples of rare earth materials were known to have very limited purity.@xcite          now let us look at how the magnetism varies as we proceed along the rare earth series .",
    "the total and species - decomposed spin magnetic moments are displayed in table [ table1 ] .",
    "there we also present the rare earth s",
    "orbital moments .",
    "it should be noted that there is some arbitrariness involved in the values of the spin magnetic moments due to the atomic sphere approximation .",
    "however , we found this to be small and moreover to make comparisons between different systems consistent we kept the ratio of the rare earth / nitrogen sphere volumes constant .",
    ".various components of the spin magnetic moment ( m@xmath17 ) of the rare earth nitrides .",
    "all values are in bohr magnetons ( @xmath18 ) . where the numbers do not quite add up to the total the remaining spin moment is in the empty spheres used in the calculation .",
    "the rare earth orbital moment ( m@xmath19 ) assumes that the rare earth ions obey hund s rules .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      we now explain how the rare earth nitrides can exhibit such a wide range of electronic properties in a series of materials that ostensibly have similar outer electronic structures . in previous papers,@xcite",
    "we have calculated the electronic structure of rare earth chalcogenides . in agreement with observation and with the naive ionic model",
    ", we found that they are all divalent insulators .",
    "one might have expected the trivalent nitrides to be similarly insulating , but , as table [ table2 ] shows , this is not the case .",
    "after the sic - lsd has been applied to the rare earth nitrides the three valence electrons of the trivalent rare earth can fill the three holes of the n p band and create a full @xmath5 band .",
    "this would lead to insulating behaviour in a similar manner that the two electrons of the divalent rare earth in the rare earth chalcogenides fill the two holes in the chalcogenide @xmath5 band . in the nitrides",
    "there are three nitrogen @xmath5 electrons , in the chalcogenides there are four @xmath5 electrons .",
    "the difference in the number of @xmath5 electrons means that the @xmath5 bands sit closer to the fermi energy in the nitrides than in the chalcogenides . in trivalent",
    "cen the nitrogen @xmath5 bands are close enough to @xmath20 to hybridise slightly with the low energy tail of the rare earth @xmath21-@xmath4 bands , causing the materials to be metallic .",
    "as we proceed across the periodic table from cen to gdn we fill the majority spin @xmath1-states and create an exchange field that is felt by the other electrons in the material . in the rare earth chalcogenides",
    "this has little effect because the filled bands are well down in the potential well .",
    "however , in the nitrides its effect is more pronounced and leads to a significant spin - splitting of the nitrogen @xmath5-bands .",
    "the sic splits the @xmath1 band manifold into two , localized and band - like @xmath1 electrons .",
    "the sic @xmath1-bands are completely localised and are unable to hybridise significantly .",
    "the non - sic @xmath1 states have a degree of itineracy that allows hybridisation .",
    "we find that n @xmath5-rare earth @xmath1 hybridised states play a role in the electronic bonding .",
    "this is clear in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . in a(ii ) panel for example , the n @xmath5-states , which lie within 0.2 ry of @xmath20 , lead to structure , in this energy range , in the sm density of states .",
    "this is an energy window where @xmath1 states do not occur , a @xmath5-@xmath1 hybrised bonding state has been formed .",
    "this occurs to some extent in all the rare earth nitrides .",
    "of course , there is also a @xmath5-@xmath1 antibonding state and it is this that is key to understanding the trends in electronic properties in this series of materials .",
    "the upper tail of the majority spin p - bands rises to above the fermi energy and hybridises with the empty majority spin bands just above @xmath20 to form the antibonding state . for smn",
    "this can be seen clearly in @xmath22 and @xmath23 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . just above @xmath20",
    "the majority spin nitrogen @xmath5 density of states in @xmath23 has a small peak that corresponds with the rare earth @xmath1-bands in @xmath22 .",
    "the exchange field keeps the minority spin @xmath1-bands well above @xmath20 and hybridisation of them with the nitrogen @xmath5-bands is very small . in prn and",
    "ndn the empty majority spin @xmath1-bands are well above @xmath20 and so the electronic properties are dominated by the majority spin rare earth @xmath21-@xmath4 bands . in pmn , smn and",
    "eun the empty majority spin @xmath1-bands have lowered and are very close to the fermi energy . the density of states at @xmath20",
    "is then dominated by @xmath5-@xmath1 bands .    in the minority spin channel",
    "there is no significant @xmath24 hybridisation and so the predominantly @xmath5-bands are entirely filled and the @xmath21-@xmath4 bands are empty .",
    "there is an energy gap at the fermi energy .",
    "the minority spin bands behave much more as expected in the naive ionic model .",
    "a consequence of this behaviour is that the nitrogen majority spin bands are not fully occupied while the minority spin bands are .",
    "this means that the nitrogen moment is antiparallel to the rare earth moment .      in the heavy rare earth",
    "nitrides a repeat of the behaviour of the light rare earths might be expected with the minority spin bands replacing the majority spin ones .",
    "this does indeed occur .",
    "inspection of figs .",
    "[ fig4]b and 4c verifies that the comparable features can be seen in the minority spin densities of states .",
    "however , other effects also come into play in the heavy rare earth nitrides that modify the electronic properties significantly .    in gdn , the majority spin @xmath1-bands are all filled and the minority spin bands are well above e@xmath25 .",
    "the exchange field continues to split the nitrogen @xmath5-band .",
    "the majority spin @xmath5-band hybridises with the gd @xmath3 bands .",
    "there is a minimum in the density of states very close to @xmath20 , but it does not quite reach zero .",
    "this is very similar to what happens in cen    in tbn , the minority spin @xmath1-bands begin to fill up .",
    "this pushes the majority spin @xmath1-bands closer to the nucleus and so increases the efficiency of the screening of the outer states so they are less strongly bound to the nucleus . because of this the rare earth @xmath3 states are higher above the fermi energy in the heavy rare earths than in the light rare earths . in tbn , dyn and hon",
    "then , there are no bands at the fermi energy and therefore they are small gap insulators . in ern , tmn and",
    "ybn the minority spin @xmath1-peak has come down to close to @xmath20 and there is a bonding and an antibonding minority spin state as in the light rare earths .",
    "as the @xmath1-peak comes down the antibonding state gets very close to @xmath20 .",
    "the fermi energy enters the major minority spin @xmath1-peak . to compensate for this some hybridised majority spin",
    "@xmath26 character has to rise above @xmath20 creating a non - zero density of states in both spin channels .",
    "the @xmath24 hybridisation pulls some minority spin character above the fermi energy and so for the heavy rare earths the nitrogen moment is parallel to the rare earth moment .    for most rare earth nitrides very little experimental data appears to be available .",
    "however , for ybn several papers have appeared in the literature reporting experiments which can be compared with our work .",
    "trivalency has been established from the magnetic moment.@xcite ott _",
    "et al . _ ,",
    "sakon _ et al . _ and",
    "et al._@xcite reported measurements consistent with heavy fermion behaviour in ybn .",
    "however it was shown later by monnier _",
    "et al._@xcite that these results were also consistent with a scenario in which there is interplay between the crystal field and the kondo effect for an isolated magnetic impurity .",
    "the sic - lda method does not include the dynamical effects necessary to describe the kondo effect or heavy fermion behaviour , so we are unable to comment on this point directly .",
    "however , we can point out that our results do exhibit the @xmath5-@xmath1 mixing necessary for the @xmath5-@xmath1 kondo effect that explains the low temperature anomalies in the magnetic susceptibility and specific heat.@xcite    the low temperature magnetic structure of ybn was established to be antiferromagnetic iii by dnni _ et al._@xcite spectroscopic investigations of ybn include core level x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps)@xcite which revealed no evidence of valence mixing , and optical spectroscopy@xcite which was able to locate the empty @xmath1 state 0.2 ev above the fermi energy",
    ". they also found the bare occupied @xmath1-states to be around 6.5 ev below the fermi energy , which is not in good agreement with our results , although there are always considerable uncertainties in locating ground state bands using spectroscopic techniques.@xcite the xps experiments also showed that samples exhibiting a small amount of non - stoichiometry can show strongly enhanced kondo features .",
    "the experimental situation for ybn has been well summed up by wachter@xcite who shows that small amounts of doping could raise the fermi energy to the empty @xmath1-state in ybn and yield intermediate valence or heavy fermion behaviour .",
    "in our calculations the position of the empty @xmath1-state is in close agreement with the optical spectroscopy results and so we are also able to suggest that .",
    "furthermore the empty @xmath1-states in tmn are actually at the fermi energy as indicated in table iii . extrapolating from the results for ybn",
    "suggests that undoped tmn might exhibit heavy fermion or intermediate valent behaviour as well .",
    "we have seen that the rare earth nitrides display a wide range of electronic properties despite having the same crystal structure with only a small variation in lattice constant and superficially similar electronic structures .",
    "they show insulating ( semiconducting ) , half - metallic and full metallic behaviours .",
    "this is a consequence of the n @xmath5 and the band - like rare earth @xmath1 states occuring in the same energy window , in the vicinity of the fermi level .",
    "this leads , at e@xmath25 , to strong hybridization of these states . with the high magnetic moments and the high densities of states in one spin channel that these materials exhibit",
    ", it suggests that alloying may enable us to fabricate materials with a wide and continuous range of useful properties , particularly with regard to spintronic and spin filtering applications .",
