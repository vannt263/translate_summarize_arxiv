    "magnetic fields are believed to play a fundamental role in the structure and evolution of t tauri stars .",
    "unfortunately , their detection and measurement in these objects is a very difficult task .",
    "early attempts to detect magnetic fields in t tauri stars through zeeman polarization were unsuccessful ( johnstone & penston 1986 , 1987 ) , and only recently such detections are forthcoming through the measurement of zeeman broadening of photospheric lines in a handful of objects ( basri et al . 1992 ; guenther 1997 ) .",
    "these measurements yield disk - averaged , photospheric field strengths of order a few kg .",
    "these observations do not provide a direct measurement of @xmath2 ; instead , what is measured is the difference in broadening of magnetically - sensitive and insensitive lines ( robinson 1980 ; marcy 1982 ; saar 1988 ) . to find the value of @xmath2 , one has to fit the data with a stellar atmosphere model and vary @xmath2 and @xmath3the fraction of stellar surface that is magnetized  until a good match is found .",
    "the result of this matching procedure is the product , and independent determination of @xmath2 and @xmath3 is much more problematic and sensitive to modeling assumptions ( see , e.g. , solanki 1992 and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , when equivalent widths are used in lieu of measuring the line broadening , the deduced  is also very sensitive to the input model atmosphere ( basri et al .",
    "1992 ; basri & marcy 1994 ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a physical constraint on the maximum value of ; this upper limit on the magnetic field strength is important to estimate @xmath2 from the -values obtained from the data , and may help to uncover potential errors in the modeling assumptions .",
    "the basic physics is rather well known , and has been successfuly applied to the study of the sun .",
    "magnetic fields are excluded from closed circulation patterns when the field lines are perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the fluid ( see , e.g. , parker 1979 , ch .",
    "16 and references therein ) ; as a result of this general principle the solar convection sweeps the field into the downdraft regions of the eddies .",
    "convective heat transport is strongly inhibited within the field ( biermann 1941 ) , and , through the so - called superadiabatic effect ( parker 1978 ) , the downflowing gas further cools and evacuates the magnetized gas ; as a result , the external gas pressure is larger than that inside the tube , and the flux tube shrinks until the total internal pressure ( thermal plus magnetic ) balances the external pressure .",
    "thus , the solar magnetic field is broken up and compressed into highly evacuated flux tubes .",
    "although we can not resolve features on the surface of other stars , it is a reasonable inference that , in complete analogy with the sun , the magnetic field in stars with outer convection zones  or convective throughout , as in the case of t tauri stars  is concentrated into discrete flux tubes , which are in pressure equilibrium with the unmagnetized gas",
    ". if this is true , then an _ upper _ limit on @xmath2 can be derived if the pressure of the unmagnetized gas is known and the gas pressure inside the flux tubes is ignored in the case of hd 215441 ( babcock 1960 ) , a value much larger than that obtained by assuming pressure balance .",
    "therefore , these fields are likely to thread the entire surface , and probably are fossil , rather than dynamo - generated , fields . in the case of t tauri stars , after the onset of convection the fossil field is quickly destroyed by the resulting turbulent difussivity .",
    "kker & rdiger ( 1997 ) estimate that in a typical tts the fossil field is destroyed in @xmath4 after the onset of convection .",
    "therefore , the magnetic field in tts must be dynamo - generated . ] .",
    "these arguments have been extensively applied to active dwarfs ( see , e.g. , saar 1996 ) , but , so far , they have never been used to study the magnetic fields in t tauri stars .    in  2",
    "i derive an expression for the maximum equipartition value of @xmath2 as a function of the stellar and atmospheric parameters , and in  3 i compare the results from  2 with current observational estimates .",
    "my conclusions follow in  4 .",
    "consider a straight flux tube that is initially perpendicular to the photospheric surface at some fiducial height .",
    "the condition of lateral pressure equilibrium , i.e. , the flux tube neither expands nor contracts , is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the difference between the external and internal non - magnetic pressures , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , and the external medium is unmagnetized . at any height ,",
    "an upper limit to @xmath2 is given by the equipartition field @xmath9 , and because temperature and pressure decrease with height in the photosphere , the maximum detectable field is the equipartition field at the optical depth where the continuum is formed ( @xmath10 ) , @xmath11^{1/2}.\\ ] ]    in principle , @xmath8 includes the contributions from both thermal pressure and ram pressure due to convective motions ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively ) because in a convective atmosphere the magnetic field outside dark spots is concentrated where the convective downdrafts are located ( see , e.g. , stein et al . , 1992 ) .",
    "however , it is easy to show that @xmath14 , and the argument is the following .",
    "the ratio @xmath15 can be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the ratio of the specific heat capacities , @xmath18 is the average speed of a ( turbulent ) convective element , and @xmath19 is the adiabatic speed of sound .",
    "although recent simulations of compressible convection ( cattaneo & malagoli , 1992 ) show that _ horizontal _ surface flows can be intermittently transonic , the downflows are subsonic , and , because @xmath20 , it follows that @xmath21 . a more stringent limit on this ratio",
    "is given by estimating @xmath22 using the mixing - length theory of convection , which gives ( see , e.g. , cox & giuli 1968 , eq .",
    "14.64 ) @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are , respectively , the stellar luminosity , effective temperature , and photospheric mean molecular weight .",
    "therefore , for the stellar parameters of a typical tts , @xmath27 , and by neglecting @xmath13 the error introduced in  is @xmath28%much smaller than the observational errors ( see below ) .",
    "henceforth i will neglect the contribution of ram pressure to , and use @xmath29 .",
    "the value of @xmath30 follows from the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium , and to a very good degree of approximation ( generally , better than a factor of @xmath31 or @xmath32 ; see , e.g. , cox & giuli 1968 ) , one can write @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the rosseland mean opacity . the gas temperature @xmath35 at @xmath10 is assumed to be the effective temperature of the star , , and , because @xmath34 is a function of density @xmath36 and @xmath35 , eq .",
    "is an implicit equation for @xmath37 for a given , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "thus , one finally obtains @xmath40^{1/2}.\\ ] ]    i have computed  for different values of  and @xmath38 by solving eq .   using the alexander & ferguson ( 1994 ) rosseland mean opacities , and using eq .  .",
    "to gauge the magnitudes of the errors introduced by the approximation used to derive eq .",
    ", i have also computed  by obtaining @xmath41 from the detailed stellar - atmosphere models by guenther et .",
    "al ( 1992 ) and allard & hauschildt ( 1995 ) .",
    "the comparison between the two sets of  so obtained is presented in table  1 .",
    "lccrl sun & @xmath42 & @xmath43 & @xmath44 & guenther et al .",
    "1992 k5 & @xmath45 & @xmath46 & @xmath47 & allard & hauschildt 1995 m1 & @xmath48 & @xmath49 & @xmath50 & allard & hauschildt 1995 m5 & @xmath48 & @xmath49 & @xmath51 & allard & hauschildt 1995 m5 & @xmath52 & @xmath53 & @xmath54 & allard & hauschildt 1995    the results in table  1 show that for spectral type k5 , or earlier , the approximation used in eq .",
    "results in an underestimate of the field by less than @xmath55% . on the other hand , for later spectral types",
    "the field is _ overestimated _ by , at most , a factor of @xmath31 , but this error decreases with decreasing gravity .",
    "the reason for this larger discrepancy at cooler temperatures is the increase in opacity due to h@xmath56o once the gas temperature drops below @xmath57 ( alexander & ferguson 1994 ) , which results in a strong non - monotonic behavior of @xmath34 with optical depth in the outer layers .    therefore , for the typical gravities of t tauri stars ( @xmath58 ) and the spectral types currently accessible to zeeman - broadening measurements ( spectral type k7 or earlier ) , the equipartition fields predicted from eq .",
    "are too small by , at most , @xmath55% when compared with detailed atmospheric models .. these errors are much smaller than the error bars for the measured @xmath59 s ( see figure 1 below ) .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that the _ measured _ field depends on the _ geometrical _ depth where the emission originates .",
    "because flux tubes are strongly evacuated , the optical depth inside a magnetized region is smaller than in the surrounding atmosphere .",
    "if the flux tube is slender enough , it will be mostly transparent to the radiation crossing its walls , and , because of its lower density , it may appear as a bright feature against the continuum from its surroundings , as the network fields in the sun do . in the solar case",
    ", the enhanced temperature compensates for the lower optical depth , and the values of @xmath2 measured in these bright points compare well with @xmath60 . if the sun is any guidance , then @xmath60 should be also a good approximation to the fields outside spots in other stars .",
    "on the other hand , larger features like sunspots are much more evacuated and cooler than slender flux tubes , and at a fixed geometrical height the optical depth is much smaller inside the spot .",
    "thus , one can see deeper into a sunspot , and they indeed appear as dimples on the sun s surface when seen near the limb  a phenomenon known as the wilson depression . because the continuum from a spot originates at a larger geometrical depth , the external pressure there is larger , and , therefore , the fields measured inside sunspots are larger than those from slender features like network fields . in the sun , the wilson depression can amount to a few scale heights , and thus the measured fields in sunspots are @xmath61 , i.e. , of order @xmath62 ( although , sometimes , values as high as @xmath63 have been measured ) . in complete analogy with the sun",
    ", one should not expect @xmath60 to be a useful limit  within a factor of a few  to the fields in stellar dark spots .",
    "the equipartition argument still applies ; however , to derive a useful limit on @xmath2 it is necessary to know the detailed thermal structure of the spot , a problem that still lacks a full solution even for the sun .",
    "at present , only two set of magnetic - field measurements for t tauri stars are available from their measurements .",
    "guenther & emerson ( 1996 ) attempted to measure the fields in tap 35 and v410 tau to demonstrate the potential of infrared lines in zeeman studies , but they obtained upper limits to @xmath2 that are consistent with the measurements of basri et al .",
    "( 1992 ) . ] : the measurements by basri et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and guenther ( 1997 ) .",
    "these observations measure the broadening of fei lines in the wavelength range @xmath64@xmath65 ; at these wavelengths , a dark spot with temperature @xmath66 that covers a fraction @xmath67 of the surface of a star with @xmath25 contributes a fraction @xmath68 of the total emission , where @xmath69 is the planck function . using the typical values @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 ( see , e.g. , bouvier et al . 1993 )",
    ", one finds that starspots contribute less than @xmath73% to the light in the range @xmath64@xmath65 .",
    "therefore , current measurements are insensitive to the magnetic fields in the center of dark spots , where @xmath2 can be larger than  at @xmath74 .",
    "figure 1 is a comparison between the _ lower _ limits to @xmath2 derived from the observations ( because @xmath75 ) and  calculated from as a function of  and different surface gravities .",
    "also shown is the value of  for the sun ; comparison of this value with the one derived from for a g2 v star gives a measure of the typical errors ( table 1 ) in the constant-@xmath38 loci in figure 1 for the spectral types currently accessible to zeeman - broadening measurements ( spectral type k7 or earlier ) .",
    "note that these errors are much smaller than the observational error bars .",
    "[ fig1 ]    there is a troubling trend in figure 1 , which is most obvious for the guenther ( 1997 ) data .",
    "the field - strengths derived by this author are above the main - sequence values of . in other words ,",
    "the only way for these objects to have magnetic fields as strong as implied by the data is for them to be _ more _ compact ( @xmath76 ) than a main - sequence star of the same spectral type . obviously , this is impossible ; moreover , @xmath77 for classical tts such as those in the guenther ( 1997 ) dataset , and , also , the absorption lines form at @xmath78 .    furthermore , since i have assumed @xmath79 in deriving a value of @xmath2 from the measured @xmath59 , these values , again , are _ lower limits _ to the field implied by the observations . therefore ,",
    "the measurements of guenther ( 1997 ) seem to overestimate @xmath2 by at least a factor of @xmath80 in the case of lk  ca  15 and a factor @xmath81 for t tau , respectively .    the measurements of basri et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for tap 35 seem compatible with the expected , in particular because they assumed @xmath82 in their models",
    ". however , if @xmath83 their measurements would imply a value of @xmath2 larger than the equipartition field in a main - sequence star of the same spectral type . moreover , they found that if @xmath84 , instead of @xmath82 , then a stronger field is required to match the data ; this is inconsistent with the dependence of  on @xmath38 at fixed  ( figure 1 ) .",
    "therefore , there are also problems with the basri et al .",
    "( 1992 ) measurements , and the implied fields are larger than .",
    "[ fig2 ]    another perspective on this inconsistency is presented in figure 2 .",
    "this figure is a plot of  as a function of  along the pre - main - squence isochrones of dantona & mazzitelli ( 1994 ) ; also shown are the paths in the @xmath85-plane traced by two stars with @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively , as they evolve towards the zero - age main - sequence .",
    "these results show that , for a given value of the stellar mass , increases with age ; therefore , if one takes @xmath88 as the age limit for the t tauri phase , the results in figure 2 imply that in tts of spectral type k7 or earlier @xmath89 outside dark spots .",
    "the equipartition field  at any level in a stellar atmosphere is an upper limit to the magnetic field strength in a flux tube in pressure equilibrium with the surrounding , non - magnetized gas .",
    "i have computed  for the physical regime appropriate to t tauri stars , and shown that the field strengths derived from current zeemann - broadening measurements exceed this upper limit by large factors , and therefore are unphysical .",
    "because the derivation of @xmath2 from the measured line widths requires detailed modeling of the emergent line profiles , the fact that current models yield @xmath90 indicates that some piece of physics is missing . to be fair to the zeeman - broadening technique ,",
    "when the zeeman components are resolved this method can be very precise ( see , e.g. , the recent measurements of @xmath2 in @xmath91  eri by valenti et al . , 1995 ) , whereas basri et al .",
    "( 1992 ) based their analysis on the equivalent widths of the lines ( due to the faintness of tts and the high signal - to - noise required by this method ) , and guenther ( 1997 ) used an autocorrelation analysis without benefit of a detailed atmospheric model .",
    "however , it is hard to imagine how the use of equivalent widths rather than line profiles can explain the finding by basri et al .",
    "( 1992 ) that a lower surface gravity requires a larger magnetic field to match the data , when the field is supposed to decrease with decreasing gravity ( see eq .  ) . therefore , the source of the discrepancy is , most likely , the input physics of the models .    in particular , current models for tts use the same atmospheric structure for the magnetic and non - magnetic parts of the photosphere , whereas at any given height the gas pressure in a flux tube has to be lower than that of its surroundings for pressure equilibrium to obtain . because the measured field depends on the geometrical height where the lines are formed , and the flux tubes must be highly evacuated ,",
    "using the same atmospheric structure for the magnetized and quiet regions of the photosphere is not correct , and is the most likely origin of the discrepancy .",
    "therefore , this and other refinements ( see landolfi et al .",
    "1989 ) must be incorporated to derive a more accurate estimate of @xmath2 in tts .",
    "in addition , valenti et al . (",
    "1995 ) showed that the zeeman - broadening method is much more immune to the details of the model atmosphere when infrared lines are used .",
    "infrared measurements should be pursued also , and one hopes that the discrepancy with the results presented here will disappear .",
    "i wish to thank robert rosner for a conversation during which the idea for this paper was conceived , and lee mundy , steve stahler , and stephen white for their careful reading of the manuscript .",
    "i am also indebted to an anonymous referee , who provided comments and criticisms that significantly improved an earlier version of this paper .",
