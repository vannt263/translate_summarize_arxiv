    "time delays are inherent in many nature s processes and systems , for example , spread of infectious diseases and epidemics @xcite , population dynamics systems @xcite , neural networks @xcite , vehicle active suspension @xcite , and biological and chemical systems @xcite . since time delays are generally regarded as one of main sources of instability and poor performance @xcite , the stability analysis issue of time - delay systems is important and has received considerable attention ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .    most of the results on stability analysis of delayed continuous - time systems are obtained by the lyapunov - krasovskii functional ( lkf ) approach @xcite .",
    "a key step of the lkf approach is how to construct lkf and to bound its derivative .",
    "it is well - known that an indispensable part of lkf is some integer items like @xmath0 where @xmath1\\rightarrow \\mathbb{r}^n$ ] is defined by @xmath2 for all @xmath3 $ ] , @xmath4 is a continuous function , @xmath5 is a real symmetric positive definite matrix , and @xmath6 is a nonnegative integer .",

    "since @xmath10 and @xmath11 the conservativeness of resulting stability criterion relies mainly on the lower bound to @xmath12 for @xmath9 .",
    "usually , the so - called jensen s inequalities ( jis ) @xcite are applied to bound @xmath13 for any nonnegative integer @xmath14 .",
    "recently , some new integral inequalities , spectrally wirtinger - type integral inequalities ( wtiis ) , have been proposed to improve jensen s inequalities ( i.e. , to give more accurate lower bounds of @xmath15 or @xmath16 ) ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "it is shown by gyurkovics @xcite that the lower bound of @xmath17 given in @xcite is more accurate than ones in @xcite , while the estimations to @xmath17 obtained in @xcite are equivalent .    in this present paper",
    ", we aim in reducing the conservativeness of lkf approach by investigating new integral inequalities based on weighted orthogonal polynomials ( wops ) which is a generalization of those jis and wtiis mentioned above as special cases .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ 15sep10-section-1 ] , we will first introduce a class of wops , and thereby investigate wops - based inequality inequalities .",
    "discussions of the relation between the wops - based inequality inequalities and the jis and wtiis in @xcite will be presented in section[15sep11-section-1 ] .",
