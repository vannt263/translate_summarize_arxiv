    "<S> one of the proposals for the exploitation of two - dimensional quantum walks has been the efficient generation of entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the technological effort required for the experimental realization of standard two - dimensional quantum walks is significantly demanding . in this respect , an alternative scheme with less challenging conditions has been recently studied , particularly in terms of spatial - entanglement generation [ c. di franco , m. mc gettrick , and th . </S>",

    "<S> rev . lett . * 106 * , 080502 ( 2011 ) ] . here , we extend the investigation to a scenario where a measurement is performed on the coin degree of freedom after the evolution , allowing a further comparison with the standard two - dimensional grover walk .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum walks have raised considerable attention in the physics community due to their potential use in the design of new quantum algorithms  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , two - dimensional quantum walks have been proposed for generating entanglement efficiently  @xcite , a critical requirement for quantum metrology and quantum information processing  @xcite . and </S>",
    "<S> yet , the experimental realization of known two - dimensional quantum walks is extremely challenging , due to the significant technological effort required . </S>",
    "<S> one of the crucial difficulties is embodied by the fact that higher - dimensional quantum coins have to be used . </S>",
    "<S> a simplification in this respect ( where only a single - qubit coin is required ) has been recently proposed  @xcite , and a comparison in terms of entanglement generation with respect to a well - known standard two - dimensional quantum walk ( grover walk ) has been reported  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the investigation has only considered the scenario where the coin degree of freedom is ignored after the evolution . performing a coin measurement </S>",
    "<S> could actually represent an advantage in terms of entanglement generation : both the single - qubit case as well as the standard grover quantum walk have to be explored . </S>",
    "<S> the study should also include an optimization process to find the best basis in which the coin has to be measured . </S>",
    "<S> this is precisely the scenario investigated in this paper .    for </S>",
    "<S> the sake of clarity , let us first briefly introduce the characteristics of the two quantum walks studied here . in both cases , as in general in any discrete - time quantum walk , the total state of the system under investigation is a vector in the composite hilbert space @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 ( walker space ) is an infinite - dimensional hilbert space spanned by @xmath2 , with @xmath3 and @xmath4 assuming all possible integer values . </S>",
    "<S> the coin space , as already stated , is different in the two cases , so we denote the coin space of the single - qubit quantum walk ( from now on , _ alternate quantum walk _ ) as @xmath5 and the one of the grover walk as @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 is a two - dimensional hilbert space spanned by @xmath7 , while @xmath6 is four - dimensional , spanned by @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> let us define the basis states of the total space @xmath9 as @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively . here , </S>",
    "<S> for the sake of simplicity , we use the notation @xmath12 and @xmath13 .    </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the system in a discrete - time quantum walk is usually defined by a sequence of conditional shift and coin operations . in the case of the alternate quantum walk </S>",
    "<S> , we have two different conditional shift operations @xmath14 and @xmath15 while the coin operation is the hadamard gate @xmath16 if we consider the walker component @xmath17 as describing the quantized position of the walker in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 directions with increasing numbers from left to right and from bottom to top , respectively , the effect of @xmath18 is to move the walker one step to the left ( right ) when the coin component is in the state @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) and the effect of @xmath21 is to move the walker one step down ( up ) when the coin component is in the state @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) . in the alternate quantum walk , </S>",
    "<S> a single time step consists of two hadamard operations and one movement each on the @xmath3 and @xmath4 directions , according to the following sequence : coin operation - movement on @xmath3 - coin operation - movement on @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> the shift operator for the grover walk is @xmath22 and the corresponding grover coin operation is given by @xmath23 the states of the computational basis of the coin @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 correspond , under the action of the shift operator , to movements in the left - down , left - up , right - down and right - up directions , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> a single time step consists here of a grover coin operation and a movement on the @xmath3-@xmath4 plane according to @xmath28 .    in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , a comparison between the @xmath3-@xmath4 spatial - entanglement generation in the two different walks has been presented . </S>",
    "<S> let us shortly comment on this particular kind of entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that we want to entangle , in the schemes aforementioned , the orthogonal directions of the lattice on which the walker is moving . clearly , this can also be seen from a different point of view , that is formally equivalent . </S>",
    "<S> we could have two particles both moving on a line ( or even on two different lines ) . </S>",
    "<S> they do not interact directly , but they share a common degree of freedom , embodied by the coin . </S>",
    "<S> the whole formalism of the quantum walks presented so far can therefore be easily mapped to this composite system , by considering the one - dimensional movement of the first particle as the shift of the original walker on the @xmath3 direction , and the one - dimensional movement of the second particle as the shift of the original walker on the @xmath4 direction . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3-@xmath4 spatial entanglement corresponds , in this scenario , to the entanglement between the position of these two different particles .    in order to evaluate the @xmath3-@xmath4 spatial entanglement , in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the degree of freedom embodied by the coin has been traced out . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to ignoring the coin state after the evolution . </S>",
    "<S> however , performing a coin measurement could actually represent an advantage in terms of entanglement generation . </S>",
    "<S> the investigation of this _ measurement - induced _ </S>",
    "<S> entanglement , seen from the two - particles point of view , is strongly related to the study performed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the analysis presented there and the alternate - walk case here is that , in that paper , no coin operation is performed between the movements of the two particles ( in our case , a hadamard gate is applied ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , here we are interested in the average entanglement generated , so we sum the amount of the entanglement corresponding to each result of the measurement multiplied by the probability to obtain that result .    </S>",
    "<S> let us start the investigation with the alternate quantum walk . </S>",
    "<S> the first attempt could be , following the lines of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , to consider the coin measurement on the computational basis @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , after the measurement , the walker state is pure ( the total state of the system , before the measurement , is pure , due to the unitarity of the evolution ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus possible to use the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrices to evaluate the measurement - induced entanglement . for this , we need to calculate @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) is the reduced density matrix of the @xmath3-position ( @xmath4-position ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results for a number of time steps up to @xmath33 are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : entanglementalternate ] .    the initial state of the coin has been chosen , in this case , as @xmath34 which gives a symmetric evolution of the spatial probability distribution for the alternate quantum walk with respect to the @xmath3 and @xmath4 axes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to check that any initial condition of the form @xmath35 with @xmath36 $ ] generates the same amount of entanglement ( notice that all these states have their bloch vector  @xcite orthogonal to those of the states in the measurement basis ) .    </S>",
    "<S> clearly , one can choose a different basis on which the coin has to be projected during the measurement stage . in order to find the basis that maximizes the average entanglement generated , </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the two generic states of this basis as @xmath37 and the orthogonal one , with @xmath38 $ ] and @xmath39 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> we have studied the generated entanglement against @xmath40 and @xmath41 for different values of @xmath42 [ fixing the initial condition of the coin as in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : alternateinitial ] ) ] and found that , for @xmath43 , the maximum always corresponds to @xmath44 and @xmath45 , with the minimum corresponding to the measurement on the computational basis ( as a significant example , we present in fig .  [ fig : entanglementalternaterotated ] the plot obtained for @xmath46 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to evaluate the maximum of the generated entanglement against @xmath42 , by fixing the optimal measurement basis . </S>",
    "<S> the results for a number of time steps between @xmath47 and @xmath46 are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : entanglementalternatemax ] .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider the entanglement generated in the grover walk . </S>",
    "<S> also in this case , we have to find the maximizing basis . </S>",
    "<S> following the investigation performed for the alternate quantum walk , we start from the computational basis @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the initial state of the coin has been chosen , here , as @xmath48 which corresponds to the non - localized case of the grover walk  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we obtain the same values presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : entanglementalternate ] . </S>",
    "<S> this numerical analysis leads us to claim that _ performing a coin measurement on the corresponding computational basis for the alternate quantum walk and the grover walk after the same number of time steps generates exactly the same amount of @xmath3-@xmath4 spatial entanglement_. the next step is clearly , also in this case , to find the basis maximizing the generation of measurement - induced entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> for the grover walk , the finding of the optimal measurement basis is more demanding , due to the larger coin space ( and therefore the larger number of variables in the definition of the basis states , over which we should maximize ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have thus used a different method . </S>",
    "<S> we have randomly generated several bases and calculated the entanglement corresponding to measurements on them . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , we present in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : entanglementgroverrandom ] the results obtained in this way for a number of time steps between @xmath47 and @xmath49 ( we have generated @xmath50 different bases ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we have then studied the entanglement generated with the particular basis @xmath51 and found that this always corresponds to the top points in the previous plot . </S>",
    "<S> for the sake of completeness , a basis giving values of entanglement corresponding to the bottom points in the previous plot is @xmath52 we can therefore use the basis in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : maxbasis ] ) to evaluate the maximum entanglement generated against @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> again , we have found that the values are exactly the same as those presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : entanglementalternatemax ] . </S>",
    "<S> this numerical analysis leads us to claim that also _ performing a coin measurement on the proper maximizing basis for the alternate quantum walk and the grover walk after the same number of time steps generates exactly the same amount of @xmath3-@xmath4 spatial entanglement_.    we have studied the generation of entanglement obtained when a measurement is performed on the coin after the evolution of the alternate quantum walk as well as the grover walk . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that , properly choosing the measurement basis , in both the cases the entanglement can be increased with respect to the value obtained with the measurement on the computational basis . </S>",
    "<S> we have presented the optimal basis for each walk and noticed that the maximum of entanglement generated by measuring on these bases is the same for both the walks . </S>",
    "<S> this means that , even if after the evolution the amounts of coin - position and @xmath3-@xmath4 spatial entanglements are different in the alternate quantum walk and the grover walk  @xcite , proper measurements are able to _ localize _  @xcite the same amount of spatial entanglement at the end of the two processes . </S>"
