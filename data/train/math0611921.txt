    "in this work we present a new descriptive theory for the tunnels of tunnel number  @xmath0 knots in @xmath1 . at its heart",
    "is a bijective correspondence between the set of equivalence classes of all tunnels of all tunnel number 1 knots and a subset of the vertices of a certain tree @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , @xmath3 is bipartite , and the tunnel vertex subset is exactly one of its two classes of vertices .",
    "the construction of @xmath3 uses the disk complex of the genus  @xmath2 handlebody , and @xmath3 is a quotient of a spine of the subcomplex of nonseparating disks .",
    "the tree and its associated objects have a rich combinatorial structure .",
    "the work in this paper is a first step toward understanding how that structure is manifested in the topology of tunnel number @xmath0 knots .",
    "the theory has many consequences .",
    "it shows that every tunnel can be obtained by starting from the unique tunnel of the trivial knot and performing a uniquely determined sequence of simple constructions .",
    "each construction is determined by a rational parameter , which is essentially a scharlemann - thompson invariant @xcite .",
    "this gives a natural numerical parameterization of all tunnels .",
    "we have computed this sequence of rational invariants for all tunnels of @xmath2-bridge knots , and for the `` short '' tunnels of torus knots .",
    "the theory adapts easily to include tunnels of tunnel number @xmath0 links , and to allow orientation - reversing equivalence .",
    "the next two sections provide overviews before beginning the actual development of the theory .",
    "section  [ sec : context ] emphasizes the context of the work , while section  [ sec : overview ] summarizes the main ideas and results of the paper and the contents of the individual sections .",
    "there are several equivalent definitions of a tunnel for a knot @xmath4 in @xmath1 .",
    "one is that a tunnel is a @xmath0-handle attached to a regular neighborhood of @xmath4 in @xmath1 to produce a genus-@xmath2 handlebody that is unknotted , that is , one of the handlebodies of a genus-@xmath2 heegaard splitting of @xmath1 .",
    "two such configurations are equivalent tunnels when the handlebodies are isotopic taking the copy of @xmath4 in one handlebody to the corresponding copy in the other .",
    "alternatively , one may think of a tunnel as an arc @xmath5 meeting @xmath4 only in its endpoints , such that a regular neighborhood of the `` @xmath6-curve '' @xmath7 is unknotted .",
    "the equivalence on such arcs must then allow not only isotopy but also `` sliding , '' where the two endpoints can meet and pass through each other .",
    "there is a stronger notion of equivalence , in which the isotopies and sliding must preserve the knot at all times .",
    "all of our work uses the weaker notion .    if one removes a small tubular neighborhood of @xmath4 from the genus-@xmath2 handlebody produced by a tunnel , the remaining compression body and its complementary genus-@xmath2 handlebody form a genus-@xmath2 heegaard splitting of the knot space , in the sense of heegaard splittings of @xmath8-manifolds with boundary . for closed @xmath8-manifolds ,",
    "genus-@xmath9 heegaard splittings are trivial , and genus-1 splittings are very restrictive , forming only lens spaces ( including @xmath1 and @xmath10 ) , while genus-@xmath2 splittings are already a very complicated class . in this context , the heegaard splittings coming from tunnel number 1 knots might be considered to be a special class of `` genus-@xmath11 '' splittings , an intermediate case where one might hope to find structure restricted enough to be tractable , but rich enough to be of mathematical interest .",
    "the historical development of the subject is consistent with this hope .",
    "an impressive amount of geometric theory of tunnel number @xmath0 knots has been developed by a number of researchers .",
    "recently , a general picture has begun to emerge , through work of m. scharlemann and a. thompson @xcite which defines a rational invariant that detects a kind of cabled structure of @xmath4 near the tunnel .",
    "one of the applications of our work is a complete clarification of how their invariant works and what information it is detecting .",
    "as mentioned above , it extends to a sequence of rational invariants which describe a unique sequence of simple constructions that produce the tunnel .",
    "these rational invariants , plus a bit more information , give a natural numerical parameterization of all knot tunnels .    other recent work in the subject has begun to utilize connections between tunnel number @xmath0 knots and the curve complex of the genus-@xmath2 surface .",
    "the curve complex provides an important measure of complexity of heegaard splittings , called the _ ( hempel ) distance . _",
    "applying it to the splittings that correspond to knot tunnels , j. johnson and a. thompson @xcite and y. minsky , y. moriah , and s. schleimer @xcite have obtained results on bridge number and other aspects of tunnels . in  @xcite",
    ", we use our theory to define a new distance - type invariant for knot tunnels , the `` depth '' , that is finer than distance ( depth can be large even when distance is small ) . as one application of the depth invariant , we can substantially improve known estimates of the growth rate of bridge number as distance increases .",
    "there are additional reasons to believe that the class of tunnel number @xmath0 knots is a nexus of interesting mathematical objects .",
    "the fundamental group of the genus-@xmath2 handlebody is the free group on two generators @xmath12 , and because of this , the mapping class group of the genus-@xmath2 handlebody is related to the automorphism group @xmath13 and thereby to the linear groups @xmath14 , which are very special and whose theory differs in many respects from the @xmath15 with  @xmath16 .",
    "it will be evident that the tree @xmath3 that is the central object in our theory carries much of the structure of the well - known tree associated to  @xmath17 .",
    "in this section , we will give an overview of the theory and applications developed in this paper , and our paper  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath18 be an unknotted genus-@xmath2 handlebody in @xmath1 .",
    "by @xmath19 we denote the @xmath2-dimensional complex whose vertices are the isotopy classes of _ nonseparating _ essential properly - imbedded disks in @xmath18 .",
    "a set of vertices spans a simplex of @xmath19 when they have pairwise disjoint representatives . in the first barycentric subdivision @xmath20 of @xmath19 ,",
    "the span of the vertices that are not vertices of @xmath19 is a tree @xmath21 .",
    "each vertex of @xmath21 is either a triple of ( isotopy classes of ) disks in @xmath18 , or a pair .",
    "figure  [ fig : subdivision ] below shows a small portion of @xmath19 and  @xmath21 .",
    "each tunnel of a tunnel number 1 knot determines a collection of disks in @xmath18 as follows .",
    "the tunnel is a @xmath0-handle attached to a regular neighborhood of the knot to form an unknotted genus-@xmath2 handlebody .",
    "an isotopy carrying this handlebody to @xmath18 carries a cocore @xmath2-disk of that @xmath0-handle to a nonseparating disk in @xmath18 .",
    "the indeterminacy of this process is the group of isotopy classes of orientation - preserving homeomorphisms of @xmath1 that preserve @xmath18 .",
    "this is the _ goeritz group @xmath22 , _ which we discuss in section  [ sec : goeritz ] below . in particular , we will recall work of m. scharlemann @xcite and e. akbas @xcite that shows that @xmath22 is finitely presented , and even provides a simple presentation of it .",
    "since @xmath22 is exactly the indeterminacy of the cocore disk , moved to @xmath18 , it is essential to understand the action of @xmath22 on @xmath19 .",
    "this action is closely related to a central concept of our viewpoint , called primitivity .",
    "a disk in @xmath18 is _ primitive _ if there exists a properly imbedded disk @xmath23 in the complementary handlebody @xmath24 such that the circles @xmath25 and @xmath26 in @xmath27 intersect transversely in a single point .",
    "viewed as tunnels , primitive disks are exactly the tunnels of the trivial knot , and are all equivalent .",
    "the portions of @xmath19 and @xmath21 corresponding to primitive disks form the `` primitive region , '' in particular the pairs and triples of primitive disks span a @xmath22-invariant subtree @xmath28 of @xmath21 called the _ primitive subtree . _",
    "the primitive subtree @xmath28 is isomorphic to the tree used by scharlemann and akbas to understand the goeritz group . as explained in section  [ sec : goeritz ] below , the @xmath2-complex used by scharlemann imbeds in a very natural way into @xmath19 , in such a way that it deformation retracts to @xmath28 ( see figure  [ fig : primitive_tree ] ) .",
    "indeed , it is fair to say that @xmath28 _ is _ the scharlemann - akbas tree .",
    "this viewpoint leads to a new proof of the main results of @xcite and @xcite that avoids many of the difficult geometric arguments of those important papers .",
    "this recasting of their work is carried out in  @xcite .    using this viewpoint , it is not difficult to analyze the action of @xmath22 on @xmath19 and @xmath21 .",
    "the action of @xmath22 on the primitive structures is as transitive as possible , while the action of @xmath22 on the nonprimitive structures has stabilizers that are as small as possible usually only the order-@xmath2 subgroup generated by the `` hyperelliptic '' element which acts trivially on all of @xmath19 .",
    "this gives a picture of @xmath29 as a tiny primitive region , together with additional portions which look exactly as they did in  @xmath19 .",
    "figure  [ fig : delta ] below shows the structure of @xmath29 and  @xmath30 near the primitive region .",
    "the quotients @xmath29 and @xmath30 are described precisely in section  [ sec : quotients ] , after preliminary work which provide a useful framework for that discussion and is used throughout the rest of the paper as well .",
    "the tree @xmath3 discussed in the introduction is defined to be @xmath30 .",
    "the vertices of @xmath29 are not in @xmath3 , but their links in the barycentric subdivision @xmath31 are subcomplexes of @xmath3 .",
    "these links are infinite trees . in @xmath3",
    ", there is a vertex @xmath32 which is the unique @xmath22-orbit of a triple of primitive disks in @xmath18 ( or dually it represents a planar @xmath6-curve in @xmath1 ) . for each vertex @xmath33 of @xmath29 , i.  e.  each tunnel",
    ", there is a unique shortest path in @xmath3 from @xmath32 to _ the vertex in the link of @xmath33 that is closest to @xmath32 .",
    "_ this closest vertex is a triple , called the _ principal vertex _ of @xmath33 , and the path is the _ principal path _ of  @xmath33 . figure  [ fig : principal_vertex ] below illustrates these structures",
    ".    those familiar with @xcite will not be surprised to learn that the disks in the principal vertex , other than @xmath33 itself , are the disks @xmath34 and @xmath35 used in the definition of the scharlemann - thompson invariant . that is , the principal vertex of @xmath33 is @xmath36 .",
    "the principal path and principal vertex of @xmath33 , along with the surrounding structure of @xmath29 , encode a great deal of geometric information about the tunnel @xmath33 and the knot @xmath37 of which it is a tunnel . in section  [ sec : cabling_construction ] we examine how the sequence of vertices in the principal path corresponds to a sequence of constructions of a very simple type , which will look familiar to experts . in a sentence , the construction is `` think of the union of @xmath4 and the tunnel arc as a @xmath6-curve , and cable the ends of the tunnel arc and one of the arcs of @xmath4 in a neighborhood of the other arc of @xmath4 . ''",
    "each of these `` cabling constructions '' ( often just called `` cablings '' ) is determined by a rational `` slope '' parameter . for the first cabling of the sequence , the indeterminacy coming from the goeritz group",
    "necessitates some special treatment ; in particular , its parameter is a `` simple '' slope taking values in @xmath38 .",
    "figures  [ fig : schematic ] and  [ fig : cabling ] below should give a fairly good idea of how cabling constructions change a pair consisting of a knot and tunnel to a more complicated pair .",
    "more precisely , the vertices in the principal path of @xmath33 are a sequence of alternating triples and pairs , which we write as @xmath32 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 . denoting by @xmath45 the edge of @xmath3 that goes from a pair @xmath46 to an adjacent triple @xmath47 ,",
    "the exact information needed to describe a cabling construction is a succession from @xmath48 to @xmath49 in the principal path . the first edge @xmath50 is special , and by itself determines a `` simple '' cabling .",
    "the uniqueness of the principal path gives one of our main results :    let @xmath33 be a tunnel of a nontrivial knot .",
    "let @xmath32 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 with @xmath44 be the principal path of @xmath33 .",
    "then the sequence of @xmath51 cablings consisting of the simple cabling determined by @xmath50 and the cablings determined by the successions from @xmath48 to @xmath49 is the _",
    "unique _ sequence of cablings beginning with the tunnel of the trivial knot and ending with @xmath33 .",
    "as detailed in sections  [ sec : slope_disks ] and  [ sec : general_slopes ] , an edge @xmath45 defines a coordinate system in which each essential disk in @xmath18 disjoint from the disks of @xmath46 and not parallel to either of them or to @xmath52 is assigned a rational slope . in particular , the @xmath53-slopes of the @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the unique disk in @xmath56 , together with a special @xmath38-valued slope associated to the initial @xmath50 , determine the exact cabling constructions in the sequence .",
    "this gives us a version of theorem  [ thm : cable_sequence ] that describes the unique cabling sequences as a parameterization of all tunnels :    let @xmath33 be a knot tunnel with principal path @xmath32 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "fix a lift of the principal path to @xmath19 , so that each @xmath57 corresponds to an actual pair of disks in  @xmath18 .    1 .",
    "if @xmath33 is primitive , put @xmath58\\in{\\operatorname{{\\mathbb q}}}/{\\operatorname{{\\mathbb z}}}$ ] . otherwise , let @xmath59\\in{\\operatorname{{\\mathbb q}}}/{\\operatorname{{\\mathbb z}}}$ ] be the simple slope of @xmath60 .",
    "2 .   if @xmath61 , then for @xmath62 let @xmath55 be the unique disk in @xmath56 and let @xmath63 be the @xmath53-slope of @xmath54 .",
    "3 .   if @xmath64 , then for @xmath65 define @xmath66 or @xmath67 according to whether or not the unique disk of @xmath68 equals the unique disk of @xmath69 .    then , sending @xmath33 to the pair @xmath70 is a bijection from the set of all tunnels of all tunnel number  @xmath0 knots to the set of all elements @xmath71,q_1/p_1,\\ldots , q_n / p_n),(s_2,\\ldots , s_n))$ ] in @xmath72 with all @xmath73 odd .",
    "this is actually proven earlier than theorem  [ thm : cable_sequence ] , since it does not require any interpretation of the principal path in terms of cabling constructions .",
    "some examples should be mentioned . a tunnel produced from the tunnel of the trivial knot by a single cabling construction",
    "is called a _ simple _ tunnel .",
    "these are exactly the `` upper and lower '' tunnels of @xmath2-bridge knots . according to theorem  [ thm : parameterization ] , these are determined by a single @xmath38-valued parameter @xmath74 , and this is of course a version of the standard rational parameter associated to the @xmath2-bridge knot .",
    "simple tunnels are examined in section  [ sec : simple_tunnels ] .",
    "a non - simple tunnel produced by a cabling sequence in which one of the original arcs of the trivial knot is retained is called a `` semisimple '' tunnel . in terms of the parameterization ,",
    "the simple and semisimple tunnels are exactly the tunnels with all @xmath66 .",
    "geometrically , the simple and semisimple tunels are the `` ( 1,1 ) '' tunnels of @xmath75-knots ( i.  e.  knots which can be put in @xmath0-bridge position with respect to the levels of a product neighborhood of an unknotted torus in @xmath1 ) . as arcs , they are sometimes called `` eyeglass '' tunnels , meaning that the tunnel arc can be slid to an unknotted circle .",
    "the `` semisimple region '' in @xmath29 appears to be where the more complicated phenomena involving tunnels occur .",
    "indeed , we do not know an example of a knot with inequivalent tunnels which is not a @xmath75-knot .",
    "the tunnels of @xmath2-bridge knots are examined in section  [ sec:2bridge ] .",
    "it is known from work of several mathematicians @xcite that a @xmath2-bridge knot has at most four equivalence classes of tunnels ( not six , for us , since we are considering tunnels only up to equivalence , rather than up to isotopy ) .",
    "two of these are the upper and lower simple tunnels .",
    "the others are semisimple tunnels , and in section  [ sec:2bridge ] we determine their exact cabling sequences .",
    "indeed , we have made software available  @xcite that computes them quite effectively .    in @xcite",
    ", we examine another kind of knot whose tunnels have been classified , the torus knots . for most torus knots ,",
    "there are two semisimple tunnels , plus a third `` short '' tunnel represented by an arc cutting across the complementary annulus in a torus containing the knot . from @xcite",
    ", it is known that the slope invariants of the short tunnel are integral , and we determine their exact values .",
    "not surprisingly , for a @xmath76 torus knot the calculation uses a continued fraction expansion of  @xmath77 .",
    "software for this is also available  @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : stinvariant ] explains how the scharlemann - thompson invariant is really the slope parameter for the final cabling construction the @xmath78 in theorem  [ thm : parameterization ] .",
    "this rational number is called the _ principal slope _ of @xmath33 .",
    "because of differing definitions , the invariants generally have different values , but they capture exactly the same geometric information . intuitively , the scharlemann - thompson invariant is `` the slope of the disk that the tunnel disk replaced as seen from the tunnel disk '' while the principal slope is `` the slope of the tunnel disk as seen from the disk it replaced , ''",
    "so it is not surprising that they are related by a continued fraction algorithm , which is described in proposition  [ prop : change_coordinates ] and has been computationally implemented  @xcite . in particular , when one of them is an integer , the other is also an integer , in fact , the negative of the first one .",
    "our entire theory extends quite easily to links , as we discuss in section  [ sec : links ] .",
    "the cabling constructions are expanded to allow cablings that produce links , which are terminal in the sense that they do not allow further cabling constructions to be performed . the parameterization theorem  [ thm : parameterization ] holds as stated , except allowing the final @xmath79 to be even .",
    "one application of the link version of the theory is a very quick proof of the fact that the only tunnels of a @xmath2-bridge link are its upper and lower tunnels  @xcite .",
    "we also show that a tunnel number  @xmath0 link with an unknotted component must have torus bridge number  @xmath2 ( theorem  [ thm : semisimple_links ] ) .",
    "the minimal length of a simplicial path in the @xmath0-skeleton of @xmath29 from a tunnel @xmath33 to the orbit of the primitive disks is called the _ depth _ of  @xmath33 .",
    "the simple and semisimple tunnels are exactly the tunnels of depth  @xmath0 .",
    "the depth invariant is the subject of our paper  @xcite . in particular , we show there that as a rather immediate consequence of work of goda , scharlemann , and thompson @xcite and scharlemann and thompson @xcite , the bridge number grows exponentially with the depth .",
    "more precisely , we have the following from  @xcite :    for @xmath80 , the minimum bridge number of a knot having a tunnel of depth  @xmath81 is @xmath82 , where @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 for @xmath86 .    as a matrix , the recursion in the minimum bridge number theorem is @xmath87 the eigenvalues of this matrix are @xmath88 , showing that the asymptotic growth of the bridge numbers of any sequence of tunnel number  @xmath0 knots as a function of depth is at least a constant multiple of @xmath89 .",
    "this improves lemma  2 of @xcite , which is that bridge number grows linearly with distance .",
    "it also improves proposition  1.11 of @xcite , which shows that bridge number grows asymptotically at least as fast as  @xmath90 .",
    "of course , the minimum bridge number theorem also shows that the bound for growth rate of @xmath89 is best possible , indeed its proof tells how to construct a tunnel of depth  @xmath81 having bridge number  @xmath82 . in  @xcite",
    ", it is also shown that minimum growth rate is achieved by a sequence of torus knot tunnels .",
    "in fact , the bridge numbers of that sequence are given by the recursion in the minimum bridge number theorem , except that one starts with @xmath83 and @xmath91 .",
    "the terms of this sequence are the minimal bridge numbers of any torus knot having a tunnel of the corresponding depth .",
    "the depth invariant has a natural geometric interpretation in terms of a construction that first appeared in the paper of h. goda , m. scharlemann , and a. thompson @xcite .",
    "that construction , which we call a giant step , takes a tunnel and produces a new tunnel ( usually of a different knot ) .",
    "they proved that every tunnel could be produced starting from the tunnel of the trivial knot and applying giant steps .",
    "it turns out that @xmath92 is the minimum length of a sequence of giant steps that produces @xmath33 . unlike the construction of a knot tunnel using cabling operations ,",
    "the choice of giant steps is usually not unique , even when one restricts to minimal sequences . using the combinatorial structure of @xmath93",
    ", we give in  @xcite an algorithm to calculate the number of distinct minimal sequences of giant steps that produce a given tunnel .",
    "in particular , this provides arbitrarily complicated examples of tunnels for which the minimal giant step construction _ is _ unique , while showing that such tunnels are sparse among the set of all tunnels .",
    "our entire theory also adapts easily to allow tunnel equivalences which may be orientation - reversing homeomorphisms of @xmath1 . in the parameterization theorem  [ thm : parameterization ] , the cabling sequence of the mirror image of a tunnel @xmath33 has the same parameters as @xmath33 except that the slopes @xmath94 become @xmath95 .",
    "this shows ( theorem  [ thm : hopflink ] ) that apart from the tunnels of the trivial knot and trivial link , the only tunnel that is equivalent to itself under an orientation - reversing homeomorphism of @xmath1 is the tunnel of the hopf link .",
    "in fact , the hopf link and its tunnel have some unusual symmetries , which are analyzed in section  [ sec : hopf_link ] .",
    "let @xmath96 be a compact , irreducible @xmath8-manifold .",
    "the _ disk complex _",
    "@xmath97 is the simplicial complex whose vertices are the isotopy classes of essential properly imbedded disks in @xmath96 , such that a collection of @xmath98 vertices spans a @xmath99-simplex if and only if they admit a set of pairwise - disjoint representatives .",
    "this is a good point at which to mention that to avoid endless repetition of `` isotopy class '' , we often speak of `` disks '' and other objects when we really mean their isotopy classes , with the implicit understanding that we always choose representatives of the isotopy classes that are the simplest possible with respect to whatever we are doing ( i.  e.  transversely intersecting in the minimum possible number of components , and so on ) .",
    "a `` unique '' disk means a unique isotopy class of disks .",
    "we often omit other formalisms that should be obvious from context , so imbedded submanifolds are assumed to be essentially and properly imbedded , unless otherwise stated , and isotopies are assumed to preserve relevant structure . to initiate this massive abuse of language",
    ", we say that a collection of @xmath98 disks in @xmath96 spans a @xmath99-simplex of @xmath97 if and only if they are pairwise disjoint .",
    "the following was proven in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  5.3 ) :    if @xmath100 is compressible , then @xmath97 is contractible .",

    "doing this with a certain amount of care allows one to produce a null - homotopy for any simplicial map of @xmath104 into the complex .",
    "the arguments given in  @xcite are basically correct , but contain some minor misstatements .",
    "a much improved treatment is given in  @xcite .",
    "fix a standard unknotted genus-@xmath2 handlebody @xmath106 . from now on , disks in @xmath18",
    "are assumed to be _ nonseparating _ unless explicitly stated otherwise . since at most three nonseparating isotopy classes in @xmath18 may be represented by disjoint disks , @xmath19 has dimension  @xmath2 .     and the tree @xmath21 .",
    "countably many @xmath2-simplices meet along each edge.,width=28 ]    a portion of @xmath19 is shown in figure  [ fig : subdivision ] . an edge of @xmath19 is a pair of disjoint nonisotopic disks in @xmath18 , and is called a _ meridian pair , _ or just a _ pair . _ similarly , a @xmath2-simplex of @xmath19 is a _ triple . _",
    "a triple corresponds to a _",
    "@xmath6-curve _ in @xmath18 ; that is , a union of three arcs meeting only in their common endpoints that is a deformation retract of @xmath18 .",
    "it is determined by the condition that each arc passes through exactly one of the disks of the triple in one point . that arc is called the arc _ dual _ to the disk it meets , and",
    "the disk is called the disk _ dual _ to the arc .",
    "also shown in figure  [ fig : subdivision ] is a tree @xmath105 which is a deformation retract of @xmath19 .",
    "it is constructed as follows .",
    "let @xmath20 be the first barycentric subdivision of @xmath19 .",
    "denote by @xmath21 the subcomplex of @xmath20 obtained by removing the open stars of the vertices of @xmath19 .",
    "it is a bipartite graph , with `` white '' vertices of valence @xmath8 represented by triples and `` black '' vertices of ( countably ) infinite valence represented by pairs .",
    "the valences reflect the fact that moving along an edge from a triple to a pair corresponds to removing one of its three disks , while moving from a pair to a triple corresponds to adding one of infinitely many possible third disks to a pair .",
    "the possible disjoint third disks that can be added are called the `` slope disks '' for the pair .",
    "the link of a vertex of @xmath19 in @xmath20 is an infinite graph contained in @xmath21 , and structurally very similar to @xmath21 , except that its white vertices have valence @xmath2 rather than valence  @xmath8 .",
    "it was proven in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  5.5 ) and in  @xcite that the link in @xmath20 of each vertex of @xmath19 is contractible . combined with theorem  [ thm : contractible ]",
    ", this implies that    @xmath21 is a tree .",
    "it is well known that complexes such as the disk complex admit actions of mapping class groups , indeed this is one of the important motivations for studying them .",
    "the mapping class group @xmath107 acts on @xmath19 , simply by @xmath108\\cdot \\langle [ d_0],\\ldots,[d_k]\\rangle = \\langle [ f(d_0)],\\ldots,[f(d_k)]\\rangle$ ] .",
