    "however , the triangle wave is just one of many _",
    "possible _ correlation functions allowed by local realism , but by no means the only one . in some sense it might be the best   but in what sense ?",
    "i am unaware of a decent mathematical answer to this question .",
    "the following notes make an attempt to describe concisely , all that local realism allows , when some key features of the curve are insisted on .",
    "according to quantum mechanics , it is in principle possible to arrange the following experiment .",
    "alice and bob are in their respective laboratories at distant locations , but have set up all kinds of practical arrangements in advance .",
    "in particular , they are at rest with respect to the same inertial frame of reference and they have set up accordingly synchronised clocks .",
    "they both possess some kind of random number generators and are able to simultaneously and independently choose angles @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the interval @xmath6 according to any desired probability distributions .",
    "they each input their chosen angle into a physical device in each of their laboratories and after a short time interval , the device responds with a binary output , which we shall code numerically as @xmath7 .",
    "the length of time between initiating the choice of random angle and output of @xmath8 is so short that a signal travelling at the speed of light and carrying alice s chosen angle from alice s to bob s lab could not arrive till after bob s output is fixed , and vice - versa .",
    "we call the inputs _ settings _ and the outputs _ outcomes_.    this can now be repeated independently as many times as one likes , say @xmath9 times , resulting in synchronised lists , all of length @xmath9 , of settings ( angles ) and outcomes ( @xmath8 ) at the two locations .",
    "we call these @xmath9 repetitions _ runs_.    in an ideal experiment , the outcomes of each separate run ( a pair of random numbers @xmath7 ) are statistically independent from those of other runs and distributed according to the following conditional probability law ( conditional on the chosen settings @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) :    @xmath10 @xmath11 these joint probabilities are a manifestation of the _ twisted malus law_.    notice that these joint probabilities possess a large number of symmetries : they are symmetric with respect to rotation , parity switch ( exchange of outcome values @xmath7 ) , exchange of the two parties ( alice and bob ) , and chirality switch ( exchange of clockwise and anti - clockwise ) .",
    "they also reflect two `` certainty '' relations : at exactly equal settings , outcomes are opposite with probability one ; at exactly opposed settings , outcomes are equal with probability one . as a consequence of the symmetry in outcome values",
    ", we also have a `` complete randomness '' property : each outcome separately , whatever the setting , is a symmetric bernoulli trial with outcomes @xmath12 .",
    "if these outcomes were generated by a classical ( i.e. , local realist ) physical model , we would be able to construct simultaneously defined random variables @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath4 , @xmath15 , such that in one run of the experiment , all these random variables are realised simultaneously , and the actually observed outcomes are merely selected by the _",
    "independent _ choice of settings @xmath4 , @xmath15 .",
    "it seems physically reasonable to assume that the joint probability distribution of the complete stochastic processes @xmath16 , @xmath17 satisfies the same symmetries : i.e. , the symmetries observed in the twisted malus law reflect underlying ( physical , fundamental ) model symmetries .",
    "in fact , under measurability conditions , we can symmetrize a given model , converting a non - symmetric model to a fully symmetric one : this is because probabilistic mixing of stochastic processes with the same , given , marginal distributions , results in a new stochastic process with the same marginal distributions .",
    "i will only explicitly impose the symmetry under rotations . as we will see , because of the `` certainty relations '' which we also impose , the other symmetries in the correlation functions are automatically true .",
    "so whether or not the other symmetries are imposed on the underlying process makes no difference to the family of correlation functions which can be generated by the model .",
    "i already used the difficult word measurability and i need now to pay this tricky topic some further attention .",
    "so far we have just assumed the existence of a single probability space on which are defined two indexed families of binary random variables @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "it follows that joint probability distributions of any finite number of these random variables are also well defined .",
    "the random function @xmath18 takes values in @xmath12 but might in principle be extraordinarily irregular .",
    "however , i would like to argue that it can at least be approximated by a piece - wise constant function making only a finite number of changes of value : in other words , @xmath19 is a finite union of intervals , and so of course too is its complement @xmath20 ; and the same for @xmath17 .    here",
    "is one argument , heuristic to be sure .",
    "first of all , in my opinion there is no loss of _ physical _ generality in assuming that any realisation of the set @xmath19 is a borel measurable subset of @xmath6 .",
    "here is a mathematical argument for this physical claim .",
    "if one is prepared to reject the axiom of choice , it is possible to axiomatically demand that all subsets of the real line are measurable .",
    "the mathematical existence of non - measurable sets is apparently a matter of mathematical taste , it refers to how large or small we want our abstract mathematical universe to be .",
    "note that with the axiom of choice , though they exist mathematically , non - measurable sets can not be constructed or computed or exhibited in any sense .",
    "so let s assume the realisations of the just mentioned sets are at least nice enough that they are borel measurable .",
    "now , any bounded measurable subset of real numbers can be arbitrarily well approximated by finite unions of intervals in the following sense : for any @xmath21 one can find an approximating set ( a finite union of intervals ) such that the set - theoretic difference between the set being approximated and its approximation can be covered by a countable set of intervals the sum of whose lengths is at most @xmath22 .    these ideas",
    "lead to me to propose that ( up to an arbitrarily good approximation , in a precise mathematical sense which has yet to be determined ) , the sample paths of @xmath16 and @xmath17 are very regular indeed : only a finite number of jumps between @xmath7",
    ".    an alternative approach would be to only consider a finite number of different angles altogether : for instance , only angles which are expressed as a whole numbers of degrees , minutes , and seconds . instead of continuous rotational symmetry",
    "we have discrete rotational symmetry .",
    "there are now no measurability or regularity issues at all .",
    "the analysis we are going to make in the regular , continuous index case , can also be made in the discrete index case , subject to the obvious modifications .",
    "we will remark later on how the results would be modified .",
    "so let us suppose that ( perhaps after an initial approximation ) , the stochastic processes @xmath16 and @xmath17 are such that the sets of angles where they take their possible values @xmath8 are finite unions of intervals .",
    "it can be shown from this that the angles at which the value jumps between @xmath7 , and the number of those angles , are random variables ( they can be written as limits of functions of finitely many coordinates ) .",
    "think of the sample paths of @xmath16 and @xmath17 as two functions on the unit circle .",
    "because of one of the `` certainty relations '' between @xmath16 and @xmath17 it follows that the sample path of @xmath17 is identical to the path of @xmath16 after rotation through an angle @xmath3 .",
    "it also follows from the other that the sample path of @xmath17 is identical to the negative of the path of @xmath16 .",
    "thus the two sample paths are determined completely by the path of @xmath16 on the first half of the circle , @xmath23 .",
    "the negative of the same path is repeated , for @xmath16 , on @xmath24 ; and the path of @xmath17 is the path of @xmath16 shifted ( rotated ) a distance @xmath3 .    let us suppose that the joint probability distribution of @xmath16 and @xmath17 is invariant under rotation , just as the correlation function is .",
    "we can write the joint probability distribution of the processes @xmath16 and @xmath17 as a probabilistic mixture over the numbers of jumps of each process . it can be argued ( details in a later to be written appendix ? ) that any such probability distribution can be built up as follows , according to what i call the randomised spinning coloured disk model .",
    "pick ( at random ) an even number @xmath25 and angles @xmath26 . colour the @xmath27 segments",
    "@xmath28 , @xmath29 ,  , @xmath30 `` black '' , `` white '' ,  , `` black '' . if @xmath31 there is just one segment @xmath32 , and it is coloured black .",
    "colour @xmath33 in complementary way : @xmath34 ,  , @xmath35 are coloured `` white '' , `` black '' ,  , `` white '' . the colour assigned to end - points does not matter .",
    "we have now coloured the entire unit circle with our two colours `` white '' and `` black '' except that we did nt determine the colours of the finitely many points on the boundaries between intervals of fixed colour .",
    "each point is opposite a point of the opposite colour , so the total length of white segments and the total length of black segments are equal .",
    "now give the coloured unit circle a random rotation chosen uniformly between @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "define @xmath38 according to whether the colour of the randomly rotated circle at point @xmath4 is black or white .",
    "define @xmath17 as the rotation of @xmath16 through the angle @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 are nt defined at finitely many angles , but we do nt have to worry about this . the probability is zero that @xmath16 is undefined at any particular given point .    if we choose @xmath39 at random according to an arbitrary probability distribution over the even non - negative integers , and then @xmath40 according to an arbitrary joint distribution given @xmath39 , and finally choose a rotation of the coloured circle completely at random , we have defined two stochastic processes @xmath16 and @xmath17 , except at finitely many points , such that the joint probability distribution of @xmath16 and @xmath17 is invariant under rotation and possesses the desired `` certainty relations '' .",
    "my mathematical claim is that this recipe generates the class of all possible processes @xmath16 and @xmath17 subject to rotation invariance , certainty relations , and regularity of sample paths ( finitely many sign changes ) .",
    "it therefore generates all of these process s correlation functions . by adding to these correlation functions also all possible limits ( in some precise sense ) of such functions one also includes correlations of processes which can be obtained as limits ( in some precise sense ) of regular ones .",
    "marginally , each @xmath13 and @xmath14 is a symmetric bernoulli trial .",
    "the joint distribution of the two stochastic processes @xmath16 , @xmath17 is not necessarily invariant under any of chirality switch , parity switch , or component exchange .",
    "however , the joint distribution of @xmath41 for any fixed pair of angles @xmath42 does possess all these invariances .",
    "this joint probability distribution consists of four probabilities adding to one .",
    "since its two margins are symmetric bernoulli trials , the joint distribution is completely determined by the single number @xmath43 which is the probability that the number of colour switches on the randomly rotated coloured unit circle between angles @xmath4 and @xmath5 is odd .",
    "this probability can only depend on the _ absolute value _ of the difference between these angles , hence is invariant under parity , party and chirality switch .",
    "the raw product moment between @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the expectation of its product , and is easily seen to be equal to @xmath44 . within our local realist model ,",
    "@xmath45 so that is the same as @xmath46 .",
    "if we write @xmath47 then we obtain from this the correlation function @xmath48 .",
    "the arguments given so far show that the set of all possible correlation functions @xmath49 is the set of all convex combinations ( including continuous combinations ) of correlation functions corresponding to some even number @xmath25 and some @xmath40 . to each @xmath39 and @xmath50 , ",
    ", @xmath51 there corresponds a colouring of the unit circle .",
    "this colouring determines stochastic processes @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "their correlation function @xmath49 can be described in terms of the colouring of the unit circle as follows : pick a point uniformly at random on the unit circle .",
    "then @xmath52 is the probability that the uniform random point has the opposite colour ( black or white ) to that of the point at a distance @xmath53 clockwise around the circle from the first chosen point .",

    "there are two main directions to explore , mathematically .",
    "one direction concerns the investigation of regularity conditions and approximation .",
    "i think it is mathematically important to tidy up the details but i do not think this direction is physically or metaphysically interesting .",
    "suppose we only considered measurement angles which were whole numbers of degrees , minutes and seconds .",
    "then there are no regularity issues at all and the representation of all classical physical epr - b models through a random spinning disk model is mathematically precise : the lengths of the segments of the disk of different colours are restricted to be whole numbers of seconds ; and at the end , we only investigate the correlation functions at whole numbers of seconds .",
    "thus we finish up looking at a slightly smaller class of correlation functions , and we only look at them at on the very fine lattice of `` whole second '' angles .",
    "the other direction is more interesting .",
    "let s accept the class of correlation functions arising from the spinning disk model .",
    "can we analytically describe this class of functions , or the topological closure of this class of functions ( according to a convenient but meaningful topology ) in an alternative succinct way ?",
    "for instance , is there an elegant description of the characteristic functions of these correlation functions ?",
    "an intriguing possible direction involving indeed the fourier transform is suggested by some lecture slides by steve gull , going back now almost 30 years . on his `` maxent 2009 '' web - page , under the heading _",
    "quantum acausality and bell s theorem _",

    "i illustrated the quantum paradox covered by bell s theorem by showing that you ca nt program two independently running computers to mimic the results of spin measurements on two spin-1/2 particles in a singlet state .",

    "however the fourier transform of any realisation of @xmath16 must have infinitely many non - zero coefficients , since otherwise it could not have any jumps .",
    "since their absolute values get squared before averaging , there is no way that all but three can vanish .",
    "i have two ideas where to go next .",
    "firstly , if we insist that the correlation function not only has the symmetries we want , but is also monotone decreasing ( between @xmath36 and @xmath3 ) that will further narrow the possibilities . maybe there is only one left  the triangle wave of my first picture ?",
    "classical correlations can exceed quantum correlations but , it seems , only at the cost of oscillations .",
    "secondly , we can express the @xmath57 distance between two curves in terms of the @xmath57 distance between their fourier transforms : might that give us a way to show that the triangle wave is the closest approximation to the cosine ?"

    "<S> i investigate the class of correlation functions that can be generated by classical composite physical systems when we restrict attention to systems which reproduce the certainty relations exactly , and for which the rotational invariance of the correlation function is the manifestation of rotational invariance of the underlying classical physics . </S>",
    "<S> i call such correlation functions _ classical epr - b correlations_.    it turns out that the other three ( binary ) symmetries can then be obtained `` for free '' : they are exhibited by the correlation function , and can be imposed on the underlying physics by adding an underlying randomisation level . </S>",
    "<S> we end up with a simple probabilistic description of all possible classical epr - b correlations in terms of a `` spinning coloured disk '' model , and a research programme : describe these functions in a concise analytic way . </S>"
