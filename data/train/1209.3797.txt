    "this is our third paper analyzing thermal infrared data of saturn s rings . in morishima",
    "et al . ( 2009 ; hereafter paper i ) , we introduced our new multilayer model , and applied it to ground - based data obtained before the cassini mission . in morishima",
    "et al . ( 2010 ; hereafter paper ii ) , we improved our code , and estimated the values of the albedo and the ratio of fast and slow rotators using thermal data radially scanned by the cassini composite infrared spectrometer ( cirs ) . in the present paper",
    ", we estimate the thermal inertia values of saturn s rings using thermal data azimuthally scanned by cassini cirs including those in saturn s shadow .",
    "saturn s main rings ( the a , b , and c rings and the cassini division ) consist of a numerous number of icy particles .",
    "the range of the particle size deduced from radio and stellar light occultations is roughly 1 cm to 10 m ( marouf et al . , 1983 ; zebker et al . , 1985 ;",
    "french and nicholson , 2000 ; cuzzi et al . ,",
    "the ring spectra in ultra - violet ( bradley et al . , 2010 ) ,",
    "near - infrared ( poulet et al . , 2003 ;",
    "nicholson et al . , 2008 ) , and far - infrared ( spilker et al . , 2005 ) light indicate that surfaces of ring particles are covered by tiny regolith particles ranging from micron to cm sizes .",
    "this means that the largest regolith particles are comparable to the smallest free floating ring particles .",
    "the abundance of free floating micron - size grains is likely to be negligible ( dones et al . , 1993 ) , except when spokes form ( e.g. , daversa et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "most likely , most of small grains ( @xmath7 cm ) stick to larger particles due to the surface energy ( e.g. , choksi et al . ,",
    "1993 ) . the composition of ring ( or regolith ) particles is mostly crystalline water ice and the mass fraction of contaminants ( tholins , pahs , or nanohematite ) is less than a percent ( poulet et al . , 2003 ; cuzzi et al . ,",
    "2009 ) .    besides the spectroscopy",
    ", thermal infrared observations can provide unique information about the surface layers of icy particles and about the particle size .",
    "the ring temperature drops during particles pass through saturn s shadow and increases after they exit from the shadow to the sunshine .",
    "the degree of the temperature drop increases with decreasing thermal inertia of the particle , if the particle size is larger than the thermal skin depth for eclipse .",
    "the thermal inertia , which is given by the square root of the product of the physical density , the specific heat , and the thermal conductivity , represents how much the particle suppresses its temperature change against illumination flux change .",
    "while the uncertainties in the density and the specific heat may be only by a factor of 2 - 3 , the thermal conductivity varies over several orders of magnitude depending on structures of surface layers . a numerical model of shoshany et al .",
    "( 2002 ) showed that the thermal conductivity decreases by a factor of @xmath8 with increasing porosity from 0 to @xmath9 .",
    "there has been no direct estimation of the porosity of ring particles . however , the internal density of ring particles of @xmath10 kg m@xmath11 or less is favorable in dynamical simulations for formation of wakes in the a and b rings ( salo et al . , 2001 ; stuart et al . , 2010 ) , because signatures of wakes become too strong in simulations using the density of the solid ice with no porosity ( @xmath12 kg m@xmath11 ) .",
    "this indicates that the porosity of ring particles is likely to be larger than @xmath13 and the surface layers porosity may be even higher .",
    "an importance of a network of microcracks was also pointed out by kouchi et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , who found very low values of the thermal conductivity of amorphous and crystalline ices ( thermal inertia values less than 10 jm@xmath0k@xmath1s@xmath2 ) in their laboratory experiments even though the porosity was low .",
    "overall , the thermal inertia value is a good indication for the structure of regolith layers represented by poorly known quantities such as the porosity .",
    "if the particle size is smaller than the thermal skin depth , the interior of the particle is roughly entirely isothermal . in this case , the temperature drop in the shadow increases with decreasing particle size and is rather independent of the thermal inertia . if the particle size is comparable to the thermal skin depth , the temperature drop depends on both thermal inertia and particle size .",
    "prior to the cassini mission , the thermal inertia values were estimated using thermal data mostly from ground - based observations .",
    "morrison ( 1974 ) and froidevaux et al .",
    "( 1981 ) estimated the thermal inertia of the b ring particles to be @xmath14 40 jm@xmath0k@xmath1s@xmath2 and @xmath3 13 jm@xmath0k@xmath1s@xmath2 , respectively , using their ground - based data and applying a simple cooling and heating model developed by aumann and kieffer ( 1973 ) .",
    "they also found that particles less than about a centimeter should not occupy a significant fraction of the ring cross section .",
    "ferrari et al .",
    "( 2005 ) applied their thermal model to their ground based data and estimated the thermal inertias of the b and c rings to be 5@xmath15 jm@xmath0k@xmath1s@xmath2 and 6@xmath16 jm@xmath0k@xmath1s@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "leyrat et al .",
    "( 2008a ) analyzed both their ground - based observation data and voyager iris data for the c ring , using their new monolayer model ( ferrari and leyrat , 2006 ) , and confirmed the very low thermal inertia estimated by ferrari et al .",
    "the thermal inertia values for the a ring and the cassini division have not been estimated so far using ring temperatures in saturn s shadow .",
    "since the saturn orbit insertion of the cassini spacecraft in july 2004 , cassini cirs has obtained more than a million spectra ( 7 @xmath17 m  1 mm ) of saturn s rings ( flasar et al .",
    ", 2005 ; spilker et al . , 2005 , 2006 ; altobelli et al . , 2007 , 2008 , 2009 ;",

    "2010 ) . in paper ii , we estimated the albedo and the fraction of fast rotators with a good radial resolution , applying our multilayer model developed in paper i to the radially scanned cirs data selected in spilker et al .",
    "although the thermal inertia values were also estimated in paper ii , the data sets were not very suitable for accurate measurements of the thermal inertia .",
    "for optically thick rings , the thermal inertia was constrained from the temperature difference between the lit and unlit faces , but there was degeneracy between the thermal inertia and the fraction of particles bouncing at the midplane . for optically thin rings ,",
    "the thermal inertia was constrained from the temperature difference between the morning and evening temperatures , but the accuracy of the estimated thermal inertia was not good because the azimuthal locations of the data points were far from saturn s shadow . in the present paper , we analyze azimuthally scanned cirs data including those in saturn s shadow and precisely estimate the thermal inertia values for saturn s main rings ( the a , b , and c rings and the cassini division ) , extensively using our multilayer model .",
    "the azimuthally scanned cirs data have advantages in their spatial and spectral resolutions , azimuthal coverages both inside and outside saturn s shadow , and solar phase coverages as compared with previous ground - based and spacecraft ( pioneer and voyager ) observations .",
    "some of azimuthally scanned cirs data obtained in the early cassini mission have been already published by leyrat et al .",
    "( 2008b ) .",
    "in addition to these data , we use some more data obtained later .    in sec .  2",
    ", we discuss how the thermal relaxation time is related to the thermal inertia and the particle size . in sec .  3",
    ", we explain data selections and fitting procedures and show fitted parameter values . in sec .  4 , we discuss implication from estimated thermal inertia values and future works .",
    "a summary is given in sec .",
    "the physics of eclipse cooling is summarized as follows . when the illumination on a ring particle changes with a typical frequency @xmath18 , its temperature is modified in a surface layer of characteristic thickness ( i.e. , thermal skin depth ) given as @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the thermal conductivity , the physical density , and the specific heat of the particle , respectively . for the case of eclipse cooling of saturn s rings , the time scale of the cycle , @xmath23 , may be the twice of the eclipse time @xmath24 , which is typically @xmath3 3 hr .",
    "the timescale to release the heat in the skin depth when the particle is in saturn s shadow ( i , e . ,",
    "thermal relaxation time for eclipse ) is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the radius of the particle , @xmath27 is the particle temperature , @xmath28 is the particle temperature calculated only using the saturn s thermal flux , @xmath29 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath30 is the thermal emissivity , and @xmath31 is the thermal inertia .",
    "the temperature @xmath32 is expected to be close to the temperature at equinox ( when the solar elevation is zero ) , which occurred in august , 2009 ( spilker et al . , 2009 ; flandes et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "if @xmath33 , @xmath27 quickly drops to @xmath28 after particles enter saturn s shadow . on the other hand , if @xmath34 , the temperature drop is negligible . for the typical thermal inertia values of saturn s ring particles reported in previous works ( @xmath35 jm@xmath0k@xmath1s@xmath2 ; ferrari et al . , 2005 ) ,",
    "@xmath36 , so the degree of the temperature drop sensitively depends on @xmath37 .",
    "( [ eq : trel ] ) assumes that the particle size is sufficiently larger than the skin depth ( @xmath38 ) . if @xmath39 , the thermal relaxation time is given by the larger one of the thermal diffusion time @xmath40 or the time to release the internal energy of whole the hemisphere by radiation @xmath41 the ratio of the two time scale is roughly given as @xmath42 . substituting typical values for saturn s rings and considering a particle comparable to the skin depth ( @xmath43 w m@xmath0 k , @xmath27 = 90 k , @xmath44 1 mm )",
    ", one can find that @xmath45 .",
    "this means that the interior of a small particle quickly reaches to isothermal due to heat conduction before the particle cools down by radiation .",
    "thus , the temperature drop of small particles in the shadow depends on the product @xmath46 instead of @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : trel ] ) . when @xmath47 , @xmath48 depends on both @xmath46 and @xmath37 . in the present paper ,",
    "we first consider particles sizes sufficiently larger than the skin depth and estimate the thermal inertia values .",
    "then , we make additional fits where size of small particles is varied .",
    "comparison between eqs .",
    "( [ eq : trel ] ) and ( [ eq : trel2 ] ) suggests that decreasing @xmath26 has an effect similar to decreasing @xmath37 ( i.e. , particles tend to react to the input illumination instantaneously in both cases ) .",
    "we will discuss this relation in sec .",
    "3.3.3 after we estimate @xmath37 and @xmath26 .",
    "our thermal model assumes a bimodal spin distribution consisting of slow and fast rotators , while an actual spin distribution of a ring may be continuous .",
    "a discussion for the criterion for fast and slow rotators is similar to the above ( farinella et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "the time scale of the illumination change for a particle spin is the spin period @xmath49 and the corresponding frequency is given by @xmath18 = @xmath50 .",
    "the particle is regarded as a fast rotator if @xmath51 , and as a slow rotator if @xmath52 .",
    "dynamical simulations for saturn s rings ( ohtsuki , 2005 ; morishima and salo , 2006 ) showed that , for saturn s rings , the spin period of the largest particles is comparable to the orbital period @xmath53 and is usually longer than the relaxation time ( @xmath54 ) , while the spin period of small particles is much shorter , as the spin period is roughly proportional to their sizes due to mutual collisions . the fraction of fast rotators @xmath55 ( the normal optical depth of fast rotators relative to the total normal optical depth , @xmath56 ) , which is one of the parameters in our model , may be approximately given by the total cross section of particles with @xmath57 relative to the total cross section of all particles .",
    "since @xmath48 depends on @xmath37 , @xmath55 depends on @xmath37 , if a spin ( and size ) distribution is given . in this paper , we first estimate @xmath55 and @xmath37 as independent parameters , as we did in papers i and ii .",
    "then , we compare estimated values of @xmath55 and @xmath37 with the relation predicted from the above theory using the size distribution estimated in previous observations ( french and nicholson , 2000 ) ( see sec .",
    "the azimuthally scanned cirs data for the main rings are summarized in tables  1 - 4 ( observational geometries ) and figs",
    ".  1 - 4 ( observed temperatures ) . only the scans selected for parameter fits ( see below ) are shown in these tables and figures , although there are more azimuthal scans .",
    "all azimuthally scanned data up to feb.18 ( doy 49 ) , 2007 , including those in our tables  1 , 2 , and 4 , are shown in leyrat et al .",
    "( 2008b ) .",
    "we use some additional data obtained later : the c10 scan for the c ring ( table  1 ) and all the data for the cassini division ( table  3 ) .",
    "the ring spectra from the cirs far - infrared channel , named focal plane 1 ( fp1 ) are used . as done in all previous works using fp1 spectra ( e.g. , spilker et al . , 2005 , 2006 ) ,",
    "the ring temperature is obtained by fitting a black body spectrum multiplied by a scale factor to the observed spectrum between 100 - 400 cm@xmath1 ( 100 - 25 @xmath17 m ) .",
    "the scale factor includes the geometric filling factor , the thermal emissivity , and a scalar factor that arises when observing a system comprised of particles at more than one temperatures ( altobelli et al .",
    ", 2007 , paper ii ) .",
    "the spectral resolution for the data ranges from 0.5 to 15.5 cm@xmath1 ( flasar et al . ,",
    "2004 ) .",
    "we select the data for parameter fits taking into account the following points .",
    "1 .   data at high solar elevation are favorable ( if they exist ) since a large temperature drop in saturn s shadow allows us to estimate the thermal inertia accurately . for the a ring and the cassini division ,",
    "the eclipse time is too short if solar elevation is large and the data at intermediately high ( @xmath59 ) or lower solar elevations are used .",
    "2 .   in order to resolve the degeneracy between the albedo and the fraction of fast rotators , it is necessary to make fits to data at low and high solar phases at the same radial location simultaneously .",
    "it is desirable that spatial resolutions and solar elevations of these scans are similar .",
    "the data for the lit face only are used for the a and b rings .",
    "the temperature of the unlit face of an optically thick ring is determined by how efficiently the heat is transported from the lit face to the unlit face and is controlled not only by the thermal inertia but also by the fraction of particles which are hindered from their vertical excursions through the midplane by mutual collisions ( paper ii ) .",
    "therefore , there will be a strong degeneracy between the thermal inertia and the fraction of bouncing particles if we include the unlit face data .",
    "we have a more detailed discussion in sec .",
    "4 .   for the a ring scans ,",
    "there are azimuthal modulations not only in the absolute thermal brightness but also in the physical temperature due to wakes ( leyrat et al . , 2008b ; ferrari et al . , 2009 )",
    "the exact reason why wakes cause temperature modulations is not well known , but this effect is most pronounced when the elevation angle of an observer , @xmath60 , is @xmath61 as well as the brightness modulation .",
    "therefore , we need to use data with @xmath62 or @xmath63 . for the b ring ,",
    "the temperature modulation is much smaller even at @xmath64 , so we do not remove data by @xmath65 values .",
    "we find that there are not many data sets available with the above restrictions .",
    "the data sets in four radial locations will be used ( one location for each ring ) : 83,000 km , 105,000 km , 120,000 km , and 129,000 km for the c ring , the b ring , the cassini division , and the a ring , respectively .",
    "since the scans cd1 and cd2 were obtained in the same day and these data have little overlaps in local hour angles , we merge these two scans to a single scan in parameter fits . the azimuthal coverages in the scans cd4 , cd5 , and cd6 were originally slightly larger than @xmath66 .",
    "we removed some of footprints in these scans in order to avoid azimuthal overlaps in a single scan ( see fig .",
    "this is just for convenience for our fitting code , and we believe that the impact of removing a small fraction of data on estimated values of parameters is very small .    the optical depth , @xmath56 , of each footprint is obtained by averaging a high resolution @xmath56 profile over the cirs fp1 footprint ( see appendix  a of paper ii ) . smoothing are those for occultations by pps and uvis .",
    "therefore , the smoothed @xmath56 is uniquely determined with a given saturnocentric radius , @xmath67 . on the other hand , in this work , the geometries of cirs observations are used .",
    "thus , the smoothed @xmath56 is not always the same even if @xmath67 s of the footprint centers are the same .",
    "the use of cirs geometries improves fits particularly for the cassini division . ] the high resolution @xmath56 profile from voyager pps ( esposito et al . , 1983 )",
    "is used for all rings and another profile from cassini uvis ( colwell et al . , 2006 , 2007 )",
    "is also used for the a and b rings for comparison .",
    "the mean value of @xmath56 averaged over all footprints for each scan is shown in tables  1 to 4 as @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "these optical depths are used in simulations .",
    "the larger value of @xmath69 than @xmath68 is due to wakes .",
    "although our model does not take into account spatial non - uniformity due to wakes , we check how estimated parameters vary with @xmath56 for the a and b rings .",
    "we use our multilayer model developed in paper i and improved in paper ii .",
    "our model solves the equation of classical radiative transfer both in thermal and visible light , taking into account all the heat sources for ring particles including the thermal and reflected visible fluxes from saturn and the inter - particle heating and scattering .",
    "a plane - parallel approximation is adopted , so spatial non - uniformity due to wakes is ignored .",
    "our model adopts a bimodal size distribution consisting of small fast rotators which isotropically emit thermal emissions and large slow rotators represented by non - spinning smooth lambertian particles .",
    "fast rotators are assumed to have a larger vertical extension than that for slow rotators .",
    "note that the zero - volume filling factor of a ring assumed in classical radiative transfer , a plane - parallel approximation , and smooth spherical particles are probably inappropriate for saturn s rings , and fitted parameters may be potentially modified in more advanced models ( see also paper ii ) .",
    "the thermal emission from a ring is calculated by integrating thermal emissions from a large number of individual fast and slow rotators .",
    "about 3000 particles are used in a single simulation , which is roughly three times larger than those used in paper ii .",
    "the most important parameters are the bolometric bond albedo , @xmath70 , the fraction of fast rotators , @xmath55 , and the thermal inertia , @xmath37 .",
    "these three parameters are simultaneously estimated in model fits .",
    "since @xmath70 and @xmath55 were well estimated in paper ii and ring temperatures vary smoothly and monotonically with these two parameters , coarse grids ( the grid sizes are typically 0.1 for @xmath70 and 0.2 for @xmath55 ) with a few points around the values estimated in paper ii are used for them . on the other hand ,",
    "fine grids are used for @xmath37 .",
    "ring temperatures in coarse parameter grids are interpolated to those for finer grids for the chi - square fits shown below .    there are some other important input parameters : the size of fast rotators @xmath71 , the optical depth @xmath56 , the ratio of the vertical scale height of fast rotators to that of slow rotators @xmath72 , and the type of the vertical motion ( whether particles rebound at the midplane or not ) .",
    "as did in paper ii , we vary these parameters and check how sensitively estimated values of @xmath70 , @xmath55 , and @xmath37 are affected . although there are some uncertainties in these other parameters , the base - line cases , for which the estimated values of parameters are marked boldly in table  5 , give the most reasonable results in paper ii and this work . , except @xmath73 for the b ring , based on dynamical studies ( salo et al . , 2001 ; morishima and salo , 2006 ) , and @xmath71 = 10 cm .",
    "this size of fast rotators is sufficiently larger than the skin depth , @xmath74 .",
    "the size of slow rotators is fixed to be 5 m in all cases . ]",
    "the error size of simulated temperatures is estimated to be less than 0.2 k ( while 0.5 k for paper ii ) .",
    "the physical density of 450 kg m@xmath11 and the specific heat of 760 j kg@xmath1 k@xmath1 are used as in papers i and ii .",
    "the total time for simulations , by which we estimated parameters shown in table  5 , was about two cpu years .    for simulations of a single scan , we use single values of @xmath67 and @xmath56 ,",
    "both averaged over all footprints .",
    "this is valid as the dispersions in @xmath67 and @xmath56 are usually small enough .",
    "exceptions are scans for the cassini division , where small changes in radii of footprint centers or spacecraft ranges result in large changes in smoothed @xmath56 s because the @xmath56 profiles , obtained in high radial resolution occultations , show large radial variations in this region .",
    "therefore , we take into account the @xmath56 variation in different footprints for scans of the cassini division by conducting two simulations with low and high @xmath56 s and linearly interpolating calculated spectra to the one for a footprint",
    ". one clear effect of the @xmath56 variation is seen in the cd6 scan ( fig .",
    "3 ) , in which the temperature drops near the noon . this",
    "is caused by the mutual shadowing effect , as @xmath56 near the noon is largest .",
    "our model succeeds in reproducing this temperature drop ( fitting curves are explained in sec .",
    "we make about 100 azimuthal bins and average the elevation @xmath65 and longitude @xmath75 of the cassini spacecraft over the bins .",
    "these averaged values are used in simulations .",
    "fine - size bins are used near the shadow lines , as azimuthal temperature variations are large around there .",
    "we first calculate thermal spectra in the range of 100 - 400 cm@xmath1 , which is the same rage used in deriving observed temperatures , with the spectral resolution of 6 cm@xmath1 .",
    "then , these spectra are smoothed over the cirs fp1 footprints ( elongated ellipses on a ring plane ) with a gaussian weight . of the signal .",
    "the azimuthal extension of the diameter projected on a ring is typically 2 - 3 degs but exceeds 10 degs for some data with low spatial resolutions .",
    "the smoothing procedure is particularly necessary for numerical data whose corresponding observational data have such large azimuthal extensions . ]",
    "this smoothing needs to be done not only in the azimuthal direction but also in the radial direction .",
    "since we use a single averaged @xmath67 value for each scan , we assume that ring spectra are uniform in the radial direction and vary only in the azimuthal direction in a footprint .",
    "this allows us to avoid conducting different simulations at slightly different radii and save computational time . applying a black body fit to the smoothed spectrum , we obtain the ring effective ( or physical ) temperature . in papers",
    "i and ii , we did not make smoothing of spectra obtained by simulations because we analyzed thermal data which were azimuthally far from saturn s shadow and azimuthal temperature variations in footprints were small there .",
    "using the effective temperatures from observations and simulations , the reduced chi - square @xmath76 in the three dimensional parameter space ( @xmath70 , @xmath55 , @xmath37 ) is evaluated .",
    "we first calculate the reduced chi - squares for low phase @xmath77 and high phase @xmath78 separately , and take the average of them : @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the total number of footprints from multiple azimuthal scans at low and high phases , @xmath84 is the number of parameters , @xmath85 is the index for a footprint , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the observed and simulated temperatures for the @xmath85-th footprint , @xmath88 is the standard error size of the observed temperature ( see below ) , @xmath89 is the solar phase angle , and @xmath90 is the angle which discriminates low and high phases .",
    "we set the error size @xmath88 to be larger one of the one obtained from black body fits or the standard deviation of temperatures in azimuthal bins ; in most cases , the latter is several times larger than the former ( 0.2 - 2.0k ) .",
    "we choose @xmath91 because a slow rotator illuminated by a single heat source has stronger thermal emission than a fast rotator when @xmath92 and vise versa .",
    "values of fitted parameters do not sensitively depend on choice of @xmath90 .",
    "the combination of best - fit values of @xmath93 is derived to minimize @xmath76 .",
    "the error bars are estimated after press et al .",
    "( 1986 ) as follows .",
    "the chi - square subtracted by its minimum value at the best - fit parameters is defined as @xmath94 .",
    "the lower and upper limits of a parameter is given by the maximum and minimum values of the parameter on the surface of @xmath95 ( 68@xmath96 confidence level of a parameter without regard to other parameters ) .",
    "when the upper or lower limits of parameters are out of coverages in simulations , we extrapolate @xmath76 to some degree .",
    "the b ring data are split into two sets , one at high solar elevations ( the scans b1-b4 ) and another at low elevations ( the scans b5- b8 ) , and @xmath76 s are calculated separately and the average @xmath76 is taken .",
    "the b ring parameters are also estimated for high and low solar elevation cases separately to see whether our model can reproduce the dependence on solar elevation .",
    "we first assume that all particles have the same value of @xmath37 .",
    "later , we consider a case with different values of @xmath37 for slow and fast rotators ( @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) and parameter fits will be done similar to the above but in the four dimensional parameter space ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "the reduced chi - square for this case is defined as @xmath100 .    in order to see the goodness of the estimated parameters ,",
    "the reduced chi - square for an individual scan is also calculated as @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the number of footprints in each scan shown in tables  1 - 4 .",
    "we first assume that all particles have the same @xmath37 .",

    "the estimated values of @xmath70 , @xmath55 , and @xmath37 for all cases are listed in table  5 as @xmath105 , and @xmath106 , respectively , and those parameters for the base - line cases are shown in fig .  5 .",

    "for the case of the b ring , @xmath107 estimated with the high @xmath109 data is lower than that with the low @xmath109 data .",
    "this means that our model underestimates the @xmath109 dependence of the ring temperature as compared with the observations .",

    "a plausible interpretation for the @xmath89-dependence of @xmath111 is that large slow rotators have lower @xmath37 values than those for small fast rotators .",
    "the thermal emission from slow rotators is relatively stronger than that from fast rotators at low phase and vice versa .",

    ", the ring physical temperature is given by the averaged temperature over different particles at a certain @xmath116 ( eq .",
    "( 27 ) of paper i ) , and all particles are assumed to be fast rotators ( @xmath118 ) so that the temperature is independent of the direction of emission . for cases with bouncing of particles at the midplane ( the top and middle panels of fig .",
    "8) , the energy is transported through the midplane by radiation only , so the unlit face temperature ( @xmath119 ) is very low and its azimuthal variation is also very small . on the lit face , the ring temperature increases with increasing @xmath116",
    "when illuminated by the sun while it decreases with increasing @xmath116 in saturn s shadow .",
    "these trends are explained by the inter - particle shadowing and heating effects , respectively .",
    "the inter - particle heating cases a sort of the green house effect , by which an optically thicker ring can retain the heat relatively longer in the planetary shadow as compared with a thinner ring ( compare the top and middle panels of fig .  8) .",
    "since the effective thermal relaxation time of a ring increases with increasing @xmath56 for a fixed @xmath37 , an estimated @xmath37 needs to decrease with increasing @xmath56 in order to reproduce the observed temperature drop in the shadow . when particles have sinusoidal vertical motion without bouncing , the vertical temperature gradient is small both for the lit and unlit faces ( the bottom panel of fig .",
    "8) . in this case",
    ", the heat is efficiently removed from both faces , meaning a short thermal relaxation time , as compared with the case with bouncing .",

    "the most likely reason for larger @xmath98 than @xmath97 is that the centrifugal force for fast rotators is so strong that fluffy regolith particles can not stay on fast rotators .",
    "unfortunately , the error bars for @xmath97 and @xmath98 are larger than those for @xmath106 , because of the increased freedom in adjusting temperature drops in the planetary shadow : although slow rotators are dominant emitters at low phase , the contribution from fast rotators is not unimportant and similarly the slow rotators contribution is not unimportant at high phase .",
    "figure  9 shows contours of @xmath120 on the @xmath97 vs. @xmath98 plane with the best - fit values of @xmath70 and @xmath55 .",
    "one can find that @xmath120 is very flat along the @xmath98 axis and the error bars for @xmath98 are not well determined for some cases .",

    "parameter fits are clearly improved by using different values of @xmath97 and @xmath98 , as the lowest @xmath122 ( with the best - fit parameters ) is lower than the lowest @xmath76 for all rings .",
    "indeed , the chi - square for an individual scan , @xmath112 , is also reduced for almost all scans for all rings . although the @xmath89-dependent systematic deviations between the modeled and observed temperatures in the shadow are much reduced , they are not completely removed , as @xmath112 is still larger than that for the @xmath89-dependent @xmath37 case .",
    "this is probably because our model assumes a bimodal size distribution whereas an actual ring has a continuous size distribution .",

    "this is similar to the definitions of the lower limits of other parameters estimated in previous sections . since a comprehensive coverage of the five dimensional parameter space is computationally so intense that the following effective method to estimate @xmath124 is adopted .",

    "therefore , the quantity constrained by the eclipse cooling is the thermal inertia , not the size of ring particles .    in sec",
    ".  3.3.2 , we found @xmath121 for all the rings .",
    "the most likely reason for this is that small fast rotators can not hold very fluffy regolith layers because of their fast spins .",
    "dynamical studies ( salo , 1987 ; ohtsuki , 2005 ; morishima and salo , 2006 ) show that the spin period is about the orbital period for the largest particles and is roughly proportional to the particle size for an extended size distribution .",
    "the centrifugal force is comparable to the self - gravity on a particle with a synchronous rotation near the roche limit , around which saturn s main rings exist .",
    "therefore , the centrifugal force well exceeds the self - gravity on surfaces of small particles .",
    "since @xmath98 is likely to be still much smaller than the thermal inertia of the solid ice with no porosity , some regolith particles probably stick to small fast rotators due to the surface energy ( choksi et al .",
    ", 1993 , albers et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "the regolith layers of fast rotators may also be compacted by mutual impacts whose velocities are larger than the velocity dispersion of large particles ( salo , 1992 ; morishima and salo , 2006 ) .",
    "alternatively , small particles might be regolith free . in this case , as suggested by kouchi et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , microcracks would be responsible for @xmath98 . in any case",
    ", it is expected that the thermal inertia increases with decreasing size of a ring particle .",
    "a similar size dependence of the thermal inertia is also found in asteroids ( delbo and tanga , 2009 ) .",
    "however , the mechanism causing the size dependence is probably different from that for saturn s ring particles ; their interpretation is that large asteroids ( @xmath144 km ) are primordial and collisional debris build up thick regolith layers on them whereas small bodies are fragments in catastrophic impacts between large bodies .    in the interpretation of the variations of @xmath97 and @xmath98 in different rings , we need to consider ( 1 ) the distribution of @xmath145 as a function of particle size @xmath26 and ( 2 ) the ratio of the smallest particle size @xmath143 to the largest particle size @xmath146 for actual rings with continuous size distribution . as we discussed in sec .  3.3.2",
    ", the thermal inertia of the largest particles , @xmath147 , may be close to @xmath97 or slightly less .",
    "therefore , @xmath147 seems to be similar for all the rings , except the cassini division has a lower @xmath147 . because @xmath37 is likely to increase with decreasing @xmath26 , as discussed above ,",
    "@xmath98 is expected to increase with decreasing @xmath148 . on the other hand , @xmath98 for the a ring",
    "is larger than that for the c and b rings , even though @xmath148 ( a ring ) = @xmath148 ( b ring ) @xmath149 ( c ring ) ( table  7 ) .",
    "this means that with a same @xmath150 ( @xmath151 ) , an a ring particle has the largest @xmath37 .",
    "thus , the size dependence of @xmath37 for the a ring is steeper than those for the b and c rings , whereas @xmath98 for the c ring larger than that for the b ring may be explained by the smaller @xmath148 for the c ring .",
    "the large @xmath98 for the a ring is probably due to wakes ( salo , 1995 ; colwell et al . , 2006 ; hedman et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "dynamical simulations ( morishima and salo , 2006 ) including the self - gravity show that the spin frequency increases with increasing @xmath67 for a fixed dynamical optical depth .",
    "the self - gravity also steepens size dependence of the spin frequency .",
    "the collision velocity between large particles are usually slow as they are in the same wake , while small particles floating in inter - wake spaces suffer collisions with impact velocities as fast as the velocity dispersion of wakes , which is much larger than the escape velocity of individual particles .",
    "therefore , for small particles with a certain @xmath150 ( @xmath152 ) , both the spin frequency and the collision velocity are largest in the a ring .",
    "these facts may explain large @xmath98 for the a ring , while @xmath97 for the a ring is similar to those for the c and b rings .",
    "it should be noted again that the spatial non - uniformity due to wakes is not directly taken into account in our model .",
    "the discussion here was based on the estimated values of @xmath98 for the standard cases and readers are cautioned that the uncertainty in @xmath98 is very large .",
    "the cassini division has the smallest @xmath97 among the saturn s main rings .",
    "this smallest value seems to be real , as @xmath111 in fig .",
    "7 at a given @xmath89 always shows the smallest value , except at very large @xmath89 ( i.e. , the cd3 scan ) .",
    "the very small value of @xmath97 may indicate that there are some dust sources around this region and ring particles are fluffily coated by these grains .",
    "there are at least two dusty ringlets in the cassini division ( hornyi et al . , 2009 ) :",
    "one in the huygens gap ( 117,490 km ) and another in the laplace gap ( 119,940 km ) called the charming ringlet ( hedman et al . , 2010 ) . in particular , the location of the latter one is very close to the centers of the cirs footprints of azimuthal scans .",
    "these dusty ringlets themselves are very tenuous and unimportant for the direct thermal emission",
    ". however , their existence indicates injection of small grains into this region by some unknown mechanisms , as they are likely to be very young ( less than a few thousand years old ; hedman et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "the small lower - cutoff size for the cassini division found in french and nicholson ( 2000 ) ( table  7 ) also seems consistent with a relatively large population of dust .",
    "they also inferred that there is a substantial variation in the particle size distribution across this region , with relatively more small particles in the inner than in the outer cassini division ( reported also in colwell et al .",
    "( 2009 ) ) .",
    "this probably indicates that the dust sources are limited to the inner cassini division .",
    "the value of @xmath111 for the cd3 scan which looks remarkably too large as compared with those for other scans seems to be explained by the fact that the saturnocentric distance of the cd3 scan is slightly larger than those for other scans ( by @xmath3 2000 km at shadow lines ) .",
    "howett et al .",
    "( 2010 ) found that the thermal inertias of saturnian satellites from rhea inward have relatively lower values ( @xmath3 10 jm@xmath0k@xmath1s@xmath2 ) than those for iapetus and phoebe ( @xmath3 20 jm@xmath0k@xmath1s@xmath2 ) , which are located farther away from saturn .",
    "they indicated that this is probably related to coating by e - ring material ejected from enceladus plumes .",
    "similar things may happen also in saturn s rings although dust sources are different .",
    "the large value of @xmath76 for the b ring in the case using all data comes from the fact that our model underestimates @xmath109 dependence of the ring temperature , as we stated in sec .",
    "by separately estimating parameters for the b ring at the high and low @xmath109 cases , the values of @xmath76 are remarkably reduced .",
    "however , @xmath76 for the high @xmath109 case is still much larger than unity .",
    "the phase angles for the scans b2 , b3 , and b4 are low . in fig .  2 , with decreasing phase angle from @xmath153 ( the b4 scan ) to @xmath61 ( the b2 scan ) , the observed temperature outside the shadow increases by @xmath3 4k , whereas the modeled temperature increases by only @xmath3 1k .",
    "therefore , our model underestimates not only @xmath109 dependence but also @xmath89 dependence at low phase .",
    "the steep @xmath89 dependence observed is probably due to the thermal opposition surge caused by packing of ring particles into thin layers ( altobelli et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "the effect of particle packing is also known to enhance @xmath109 dependence of photometric brightness for dense rings ( salo and karjalainen , 2003 ) , but it is uncertain if it is also the case for the thermal emission . for more accurate estimations of particle properties for optically thick rings such as the b and a rings , this packing effect and the effect due to wakes need to be taken into account in future models .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that parameters estimated in the present work are not so different from actual values , because the deviations between observed and modeled temperatures remain reasonably small .",
    "we have estimated the thermal inertia values for only four radial points in this study ( one point for each ring ) , and it is desirable to examine the radial variation of the thermal inertia in each ring .",
    "unfortunately , azimuthal scans were taken at only a limited number of radial points by cassini cirs and it is probably difficult to cover a sufficiently large number of radial points even in the extended mission .",
    "however , there are some quasi - radial scans along the shadow lines and in saturn s shadow . even if we use reasonable sets of shadow scans , precise estimation of @xmath37",
    "is not simple in the optically thick rings ( the a and b rings ) because an estimated @xmath37 depends on types of vertical motion of ring particles and adopted @xmath56 ( table  5 ) .",
    "the degeneracy between @xmath37 and the type of vertical motion can be resolved if we combine @xmath37 estimated from the temperature difference between the lit and unlit faces ( paper ii ) and @xmath37 estimated from the eclipse cooling ( this work ) .",
    "figure  11 shows comparisons of parameters estimated in paper ii ( solid lines ) and this work ( diamonds ) for the case with @xmath68 .",

    "in fact , with the non - bouncing model , @xmath37 and @xmath70 for the a ring from this study are slightly higher and lower than those from paper ii .",
    "these deviations are fixed if we assume a small fraction of particles rebound at the midplane , because both @xmath37 from paper ii and @xmath70 from this study increase with increasing fraction of bouncing particles .",
    "there is still a problem in fitted parameters due to their dependences on @xmath56 .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath56 for the a and b rings comes from wakes ( colwell et al . , 2006 , 2007 ) ,",
    "so ultimately more sophisticated models , which take into account wakes , are necessary .",

    ", the particle spin period is approximately given as @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the numerical constant and depends on @xmath67 and @xmath56 ; we take @xmath170 2.0 , 1.0 , 2.0 , and 0.5 for the c ring , the b ring , the cassini division , and the a ring from fig .  11 of morishima and salo ( 2006 )",

    "the temperature , @xmath28 is supposed to be derived from the flux to the night - side hemisphere of a particle , and we take its value from the equinox data assuming the night - side hemisphere is illuminated only by saturn : 65 k for the c ring and 48 k for other rings ( spilker et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "if we simply regard a particle with @xmath176 as a fast rotator and a particle with @xmath177 as a slow rotator , the fraction of fast rotators in cross section @xmath55 is given as @xmath178 eqs.([eq : rcrit ] ) and ( [ eq : ff2 ] ) indicate that @xmath55 increases with increasing @xmath37 and deceasing @xmath27 and @xmath53 , for given @xmath148 and @xmath179 .",

    "we find good agreements between values from our parameter fits and the theoretical prediction for all rings . in paper ii",
    ", we discussed that our model probably underestimates @xmath55 due to the lack of the effects of packing of ring particles and surface roughness .",
    "the good agreements seen in fig .  13 may indicate that these effects do not largely change estimated values of parameters such as @xmath55 and @xmath37 .",
    "for the a and b rings , we may need to use a larger @xmath28 due to the mutual heating . in this case , @xmath55 predicted from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ff2 ] ) will be lower than those shown in fig .  13 and the agreements will be even better unless @xmath28 is very close to @xmath27 .",
    "in the present paper , we have estimated the thermal inertia values of saturn s main rings by applying our thermal model to azimuthally scanned spectra taken by the cassini cirs instrument .",
    "model fits show the thermal inertia of ring particles to be : 16@xmath180 , 13@xmath181 , 20@xmath182 , and 11@xmath183 jm@xmath0k@xmath1s@xmath2 for the a , b , and c rings and the cassini division , respectively .",
    "however , there are systematic deviations between modeled and observed temperatures in saturn s shadow depending on solar phase angle .",
    "test fits , which allow individual scans taken at different solar phase angles to have different thermal inertia values , show that the apparent thermal inertia increases with solar phase angle .",
    "this dependence is likely to be explained , if large slowly spinning particles have lower thermal inertia values than those for small fast spinning particles , because the thermal emission of the slow rotators is relatively stronger than that of fast rotators at low phase and vise versa .",
    "we made additional parameter fits , which assume that slow and fast rotators have different thermal inertia values .",
    "the estimated thermal inertia values of slow rotators are 8@xmath184 , 8@xmath185 , 9@xmath186 , and 5@xmath187 jm@xmath0k@xmath1s@xmath2 for the a ,",

    "the values for fast rotators are still much smaller than those for the solid ice with no porosity .",
    "thus , fast rotators are likely to have surface regolith layers , but these may be not as fluffy as those for slow rotators , probably because the capability of holding regolith particles is limited for fast rotators due to the centrifugal force .",
    "the large thermal inertia of fast rotators for the a ring is probably due to wakes , which largely enhance spin and collision velocities of small particles .",
    "the low thermal inertia of the cassini division probably indicates that there are some dust sources around this region and ring particles are fluffily coated by dust .",
    "other additional parameter fits , in which size of fast rotators is varied , indicate that particles less than @xmath3 1 cm should not occupy more than a half of the cross section for the a , b , and c rings .",

    "<S> the thermal inertia values of saturn s main rings ( the a , b , and c rings and the cassini division ) are derived by applying our thermal model to azimuthally scanned spectra taken by the cassini composite infrared spectrometer ( cirs ) . </S>",

    "<S> however , there are systematic deviations between modeled and observed temperatures in saturn s shadow depending on solar phase angle , and these deviations indicate that the apparent thermal inertia increases with solar phase angle . </S>",
    "<S> this dependence is likely to be explained if large slowly spinning particles have lower thermal inertia values than those for small fast spinning particles because the thermal emission of slow rotators is relatively stronger than that of fast rotators at low phase and vise versa . </S>",
    "<S> additional parameter fits , which assume that slow and fast rotators have different thermal inertia values , show the derived thermal inertia values of slow ( fast ) rotators to be 8 ( 77 ) , 8 ( 27 ) , 9 ( 34 ) , 5 ( 55 ) jm@xmath0k@xmath1s@xmath2 for the a , b , and c rings , and the cassini division , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the values for fast rotators are still much smaller than those for solid ice with no porosity . </S>",
    "<S> thus , fast rotators are likely to have surface regolith layers , but these may not be as fluffy as those for slow rotators , probably because the capability of holding regolith particles is limited for fast rotators due to the strong centrifugal force on surfaces of fast rotators . </S>",
