    "hd185351  ( @xmath12kic8566020 , hr7468 , hip96459 ) is the third brightest target star in the field of view of the nasa _ kepler _  mission @xcite . with a _",
    "kepler_-band magnitude @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , only ch  cyg and @xmath15  cyg are brighter .",
    "having exhausted its core hydrogen fuel source hd185351  has evolved away from the main sequence and now resides at the base of the red giant branch of the h ",

    "the _ hipparcos _  catalog lists @xmath16 , absolute v - band magnitude @xmath17 and a parallax - based distance of @xmath18  pc @xcite .",
    "the @xcite catalog of revised mk spectral types classifies hd185351  as a g8.5iii , indicating a giant luminosity class .",
    "however , it s location in the observational h ",
    "r diagram is consistent with being a class iv subgiant according to the conventions used by @xcite , and it is among the `` subgiant '' targets of the doppler - based planet survey of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "recent spectroscopic analyses give mass estimates ranging from 1.41.7  @xmath6  @xcite , indicating that hd185351  was once an f or a  type dwarf similar to procyon or sirius while on the main sequence  a massive , evolved class of stars that @xcite termed the `` retired a stars . ''",
    "however , these and other mass estimates for single stars are based on stellar evolution models , which may contain systematic errors due to , e.g. , uncertainties in the treatment of convection and errors related to the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) in modeling their stellar spectra .",
    "indeed , the mass estimates of subgiants in particular have recently been called into question based on theoretical grounds @xcite , and on the basis of comparing the galactic space motions of evolved and unevolved stars of various masses @xcite .",
    "these studies suggest that , in a statistical sense , subgiants with masses in excess of 1.5  @xmath6  should be rare in the solar neighborhood . following this argument",
    ", stars like hd185351  are much more likely to be the evolved counterparts of g or f  type stars , with masses in the range 1.11.3  @xmath6 , rather than the elder brethren of a  type stars .",
    "the resolution of this question has important implications for the reliability of stellar evolution models along the subgiant and giant branches .",
    "the issue also impacts our understanding of planet occurrence as a function of stellar mass because much of what is known about planets around stars with @xmath19  @xmath20  @xmath6  comes from doppler surveys of evolved stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is because main - sequence a and f  type dwarfs are rapid rotators and exhibit large amounts of radial velocity `` jitter , '' making the detection of even jovian - mass planets difficult or impossible @xcite .",
    "however , once these stars evolve off of the main sequence , they experience rapid spin - down due to the onset of surface convective layers , which generate magnetic dynamos that carry angular momentum via stellar winds to the alfvn point ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    surveys of massive , evolved stars have discovered giant planets orbiting evolved stars with masses in excess of @xmath21  @xmath6  at rates that are much higher than have been found for solar - mass and m - type dwarf stars , revealing an apparent correlation between stellar mass and giant planet occurrence @xcite .",
    "this relationship has provided important clues about the planet formation process @xcite and hinted at fertile hunting grounds for additional planets via , e.g. , high - contrast , direct imaging of main - sequence a - type stars @xcite . however , the reality of the apparent correlation between stellar mass and giant planet occurrence hinges on accurate knowledge of the masses of evolved stars @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we address this question using several independent and complementary methods to measure the mass of the putative retired a star , hd185351 .",
    "our methodology is similar to the study of the physical properties of the planet - hosting giant stars @xmath22  draconis and @xmath23  geminorum @xcite .",
    "we take advantage of the proximity of hd185351 to the sun and its relatively large physical size ( @xmath24  @xmath4 ) to measure its angular diameter using optical and near infrared ( nir ) interferometry ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we also leverage the star s placement in the _ kepler _  field to measure its surface gravity and mean density based on its p - mode oscillation spectrum using _ kepler _  short - cadence photometry . using asteroseismic scaling relations extrapolated from the sun ,",
    "as has been done for evolved stars by , e.g. , @xcite , we obtain accurate and precise measurements of the stellar mass and radius .",
    "we then fit spectra to the star s broad - band spectral energy distribution , along with the interferometric angular diameter , to derive the star s effective temperature .",
    "finally , we compare these independently - measured physical properties to the quantities estimated from the interpolation of the star s spectroscopic properties onto stellar evolution model grids .",
    "the relative radial velocity of hd185351  has been monitored at high precision ( @xmath25  m  s@xmath26 ) over the past decade as part of the doppler survey of subgiants performed by @xcite , initiated at the lick observatory in northern california using the hamilton spectrometer .",
    "the radial velocities of the target stars in this survey are measured with respect to co - added , iodine - free `` template '' spectra @xcite .",
    "these template spectra are also useful for measuring the spectroscopic properties of the targets stars .",
    "our lick template spectra were observed with a resolving power @xmath27 , and a signal - to - noise ratio , s / n  @xmath28 at 550  nm .",
    "in addition to the two lick / hamilton template spectra of hd185351 , we also obtained three additional templates using the high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires ) on the keck 10-meter telescope atop mauna kea in hawaii @xcite .",
    "our keck / hires template spectra have @xmath29 and s / n  @xmath30 at 550  nm .",
    "we derived the global spectroscopic parameters from our high - resolution spectra using an iterative version of the spectroscopy made easy ( sme ) analysis package @xcite which uses the yonsei - yale model grids ( y2 ; * ? ? ? * ) to provide a constraint on surface gravity ( cf figure 1 of * ? ? ? * for a illustrative flow chart of the iterative scheme ) .",
    "this process helps to break the degeneracies between @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and [ fe / h ] @xcite .",
    "the line list used in the analysis is from @xcite and includes the mg  b triplet region in addition to spectral segments spanning @xmath33    between 6000    and 6200   .",
    "the spectra are first analyzed with surface gravity , effective temperature , projected rotational velocity , overall metallicity [ m / h ] , and five elemental abundances ( na , si , ti , fe , and ni ) as free parameters .",
    "solar values are used for initial parameters except for @xmath32  and @xmath31  where rough estimates are derived from the star s b - v color .",
    "sme uses forward modelling of the selected spectral region and @xmath34 minimization to find the best model .",
    "the _ hipparcos _ distance and the bolometric correction for the star are used to determine @xmath35 and combined with the spectroscopic @xmath32 , [ fe / h ] , and [ si / fe ] ( as a proxy for [ @xmath36/fe ] ) to interpolate in the y@xmath37 evolution grid grids . ] .",
    "if the spectroscopic and model - grid gravities do nt agree to within 0.001 dex , the gravity is fixed to that of the grid and the sme analysis is run again .",
    "this process iterates until the surface gravity of the lte fit converges to the prediction of the evolution models .",
    "our sme analysis results in a metallicity [ fe / h ]  @xmath38 , surface gravity @xmath39 , and effective temperature @xmath32  @xmath40  k. the other spectroscopic parameters are summarized in table  [ tab : concordance ] .",
    "note that the errors are the formal uncertainties derived from the sme fitting procedure as described by @xcite , and as such do not include various unknown systematic contributions .",
    "we find that fixing the surface gravity at a value @xmath41  dex lower than our best - fitting value ( the difference between our sme - based @xmath31  and the value measured from interferometry in   [ sec : astero ] ) results in a 9  k lower effective temperature , and a 0.04  dex lower metallicity .",
    "@xcite identify a possible 0.05  dex systematic error in metallicity from sme , which will affect stellar mass estimates based on interpolating stellar evolution model grids . a systematic error of this size results in a @xmath42  @xmath6  change ( @xmath43% ) in the mass measured from model grids .",
    "thus , systematic uncertainties of the same magnitude as our internal errors do not have a large affect on our mass measurements that rely on our sme - based spectroscopic properties .",
    "we obtained long - baseline , optical / near - infrared ( nir ) interferometric observations of hd185351  using the center for high angular resolution astronomy ( chara ) array located at mount wilson observatory , near los angeles , ca .",
    "the chara array consists of six 1-meter telescopes in a y - configuration joined together in a central location on the observatory grounds .",
    "the longest available baseline is 330  m , making it the largest effective aperture in the world at optical and nir wavelengths .",
    "we use a combination of both the chara classic @xcite and precision astronomical visible observations ( pavo ) beam combiners @xcite .",
    "the chara classic instrument is a pupil - plane beam combiner operating in nir @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 bands in either two or three  telescope configurations @xcite , and can observe objects as faint as @xmath47 .",
    "the pavo instrument is also a three - beam pupil - plane beam combiner , operating over a wavelength range of 0.650.80@xmath48 m ( * ? ? ?",
    "* approximately the bessell @xmath49-band ) , and has a limiting magnitude of @xmath50 .",
    "the available angular resolution of an interferometer is dependent on the baseline as well as the wavelength .",
    "thus , at a fixed baseline the pavo instrument has higher angular resolution compared to classic owing to the shorter observed wavelengths .",
    "however , in practice it is typical to configure the array depending on the instrument and choice baseline configuration in order to sample the spatial frequencies and uv space appropriate for the science target . if the goal is to measure a diameter of a symmetric object such as hd185351 , we ensure proper sampling of the visibility curve given observations with longer baselines in the nir with classic and shorter baselines in the visible with pavo . if resolution is not a necessity , it is advantageous for observations to be made in the infrared where limb - darkening corrections and their associated uncertainties are relatively small compared to those at optical wavelengths .",
    "both pavo and classic are routinely used to measure sub - milliarcsecond ( mas ) angular diameters of stars @xcite .",
    "calibrated visibilities have shown excellent agreement with measurements from various interferometers using independent beam combiners operating in the visible or near infrared @xcite .",
    "our chara classic observations were obtained in august of 2012 using the s2-w1 pair of telescopes , which have a maximum baseline of @xmath51  m in @xmath45-band ( @xmath52 m ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "our pavo observations were obtained on august 11 , 2012 , july 7 , 2013 , and april 67 , 2014 with the w1-w2 pair of telescopes ( @xmath53  m ) , and on april 10 2014 with the e2-w2 pair of telescopes ( @xmath54  m ) , in 23 independent wavelength channels between @xmath55 nm .",
    "a log of the observations can be found in table  [ tab : interflog ] , where we list the ut date , interferometer configuration , number of bracketed observations , and the calibrator stars observed .",
    "we follow the same observing procedures outlined in @xcite , which we briefly summarize herein .",
    "the science star was observed in bracketed sequences along with calibrators stars .",
    "calibrators were chosen to be unresolved sources that lie within a few degrees on the sky to the science target . in order to select suitable calibrators",
    ", we use the searchcal tool developed by the jmmc working group @xcite .",
    "we investigate each calibrator for any unexpected variance by comparing the data with the other calibrators observed on each night and found none .",
    "observations were collected over the course of several nights , rotating between selected calibrators in order to reduce any night - to - night systematics , though we did not identify any evidence of systematic errors within the data set .",
    "the august 2012 pavo observations were taken with only one calibrator , hd188665 , which has previously been tested and used as a good calibration source with pavo observations of _ kepler _  stars in the field @xcite .    to measure the angular diameter of hd185351  we fitted a limb - darkened disk model to the calibrated visibility measurements @xcite ,    @xmath56,\\label{eqn : vis}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath57 is the visibility , and @xmath58 is the linear limb - darkening coefficient .",
    "@xmath59 is the @xmath60 order bessel function , and is a function of @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the projected baseline , @xmath63 is the angular diameter after correction for limb - darkening , and @xmath64 is the wavelength at which the observations was made . the quantity @xmath65 is also known as the spatial frequency .",
    "the linear limb - darkening coefficients were determined in @xmath45 and @xmath49 bands by interpolating the model grid by @xcite to the spectroscopic measurements of [ fe / h ] , @xmath31  and @xmath32  given in ",
    "[ sec : spectroscopy ] .",
    "we note that the uncertainties in the limb - darkening coefficients are small compared to the total uncertainty in the angular diameter @xcite .",
    "furthermore , oblateness due to rotation is expected to have negligible influence for a slowly rotating evolved star such as hd185351 .    the model ",
    "fitting procedure and parameter uncertainty estimation was performed using the method outlined in @xcite , which involves monte carlo simulations taking into account uncertainties in the data , wavelength calibration , calibrator sizes and limb - darkening coefficients .",
    "a simultaneous fit was made to the classic and pavo observations , with a common angular diameter and different limb - darkening coefficients .",
    "figure  [ fig : visibilities ] shows the observed visibilities and fitted model .",
    "we find hd185351  has a limb - darkened angular diameter of @xmath66  mas .",
    "combined with the _ hipparcos _  parallax , this measurement implies a linear radius of @xmath67  @xmath68  @xmath4(corresponding to the rosseland , or mean , radiating surface of the star ) .",
    "fitting the classic and pavo observations individually provides consistent results ( see table  [ tab : interf ] ) .      in order to determine hd185351 s",
    "effective temperature and luminosity as directly as possible we perform a stellar spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fit to literature broad - band and spectro - photometric data published in .",
    "our procedure is analogous to that of @xcite : we perform a @xmath34-minimization of a linearly - interpolated sed template based on the g5iii and g8iii templates from the @xcite library to the aforementioned literature photometry of hd185351 .",

    "only the central broad - band filter wavelengths are correlated with the sed template s flux value averaged over the filter transmission range in wavelength .",
    "literature spectrophotometry data are used to trace out the shape of the sed in more detail than broadband data , and they thus help in the manual selection of the input spectral template .",
    "the sed template is scaled to minimize @xmath34 and then integrated over wavelength to obtain the bolometric flux , @xmath71 .    in our fitting procedure",
    ", the value for interstellar reddening , @xmath72 , is allowed to float .",
    "the best fit is obtained when @xmath72 is 0 , which is sensible given hd185351 s small distance .",
    "based on 325 photometric data points , we calculate the bolometric flux to be @xmath73  erg  @xmath74  s@xmath26 with a @xmath75 . to account for uncertainties due to the absolute flux calibration of the photometry , we added a 3% error in quadrature to the formal uncertainty , yielding @xmath76  erg  @xmath74  s@xmath26 .",
    "we also performed an alternative estimation of @xmath77 using a spectrum taken with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) aboard the the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "the stis spectrum covers the @xmath69 m wavelength range at an intermediate spectral resolution of @xmath78 , corresponding to @xmath79 of the total radiated power of hd185351 .",
    "potential errors induced by absolute flux calibration of ground - based spectro - photometry are reduced considerably by using this approach , as the uncertainties of the absolute flux calibration of the stis spectrum are @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "the bolometric flux is measured by fitting , through @xmath34 minimization , the stis data to theoretical atmosphere models interpolated from a grid of atlas9 models with solar composition ( [ fe / h]=0.0 ) and microturbulent velocity @xmath70kms@xmath26 .",
    "the parameters of the model are the atmosphere temperature @xmath81 and @xmath71 .",
    "similar to the pickles ( 1998 ) fit the best fit is found for @xmath82 , as expected for such a nearby star .",

    "photometric measurements of the integrated flux from a star of sufficient precision reveal brightness oscillations from p - modes driven by stochastic convective motion near the stellar photosphere .",
    "this convective motion drives standing waves within the star characterized by spherical degree @xmath92 ( the total number of surface nodes ) , azimuthal order @xmath93 ( the number of nodes along the stellar equator ) , and radial order @xmath94 ( the number of nodes from the center to the surface of the star ) . modes with low @xmath92 and high @xmath94 can be observed in the stellar flux integrated over the visible stellar surface , and the nature of these modes is related to the star s fundamental physical characteristics .",
    "the competition between convective driving and damping in the star s surface layers gives rise to an envelope of frequencies in the photometric power spectrum characterized by the frequency of maximum power , , and the large frequency separation , .",
    "the latter is the average separation between power - spectrum peaks with the same value of @xmath92 and consecutive values of @xmath94 .",
    "the first - order asymptotic analysis of p - mode oscillations shows that @xmath95 , where @xmath96  is the mean stellar density @xcite . scaling with respect to the solar p - mode spectrum gives    @xmath97",

    "for an ideal gas , @xmath103 , where @xmath81 is the mean stellar temperature in the photosphere , and the scale height is given by @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the surface gravity .",
    "making use of homology relations and scaling with respect to the sun yields @xcite :    @xmath106    equations [ eqn : dnu ] and [ eqn : numax ] are approximate relations and require careful calibration , in particular for low - luminosity rgb stars such as hd185351 , which are significantly more evolved than the sun .",
    "detailed reviews of theoretical and empirical tests of asteroseismic scaling relations can be found in @xcite and @xcite , and we present a brief discussion as relevant for hd185351  here .    empirical tests using long - baseline interferometry and hipparcos parallaxes have shown that asteroseismic radii calculated from scaling relations are accurate to @xmath1074% for main - sequence and subgiant stars @xcite . while such comparisons are currently still limited to @xmath108 for rgb stars due to poor parallax precisions , empirical tests using cluster giants ( including low - luminosity rgb stars similar to hd185351 ) have shown agreement within @xmath109 in radius @xcite .",
    "empirical tests of asteroseismic masses are more challenging , and have relied on eclipsing binaries and cluster members .",
    "@xcite showed that masses for rgb stars in ngc6819 show no systematic offset with a scatter of @xmath10715% , while the average asteroseismic cluster mass lies within @xmath1107% of the mass determined from near turn - off eclipsing binary stars @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite measured the mass of an oscillating red giant in a double - lined eclipsing binary , which was found to be @xmath111% more massive than the seismic mass @xcite .",
    "however , it is likely that the giant is a he - core burning red clump star , for which systematic offsets in the @xmath112 scaling relation have been noted @xcite .",
    "additional , yet model - dependent tests can be performed by comparing properties derived from detailed modeling of individual oscillation frequencies , which contain information on the core properties of the star , such as the sound speed gradient .",
    "such detailed modeling efforts for rgb stars have yielded radii and masses that agree within @xmath1103% and @xmath1105% of the values derived from scaling relations @xcite .    in summary , various tests to date have shown that asteroseismic scaling relations for stars in similar evolutionary stages to hd185351can be expected to be accurate to @xmath113% and @xmath11010% in radius and mass , respectively .",
    "we note that improvements to the  scaling relation based on models have been proposed in the literature , for example based on the comparison of  calculated from individual frequencies with model densities @xcite , the extension of the asymptotic relation to second order @xcite or theoretical relations between fundamental properties for red giants @xcite . the effect of these corrections on the derived fundamental properties for hd185351  are discussed in   [ sec : scalingpars ] .",
    "the _ kepler _  mission observed hd185351  in long - cadence mode ( @xmath114  min cadence ) from q1 - 3 , spanning a total of roughly 200  days .",
    "however , due to the lack of a proper dedicated pixel mask , and because hd185351  is expected to oscillate very close to the long - cadence nyquist frequency ( @xmath115hz ) , the quality of the photometry is not amenable for asteroseismology . in order to detect oscillations in hd185351  with sufficient sampling and signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) , we obtained one quarter of kepler short - cadence data with a dedicated pixel mask through an application for director s discretionary time ( ddt ) in quarter 16 . the data set spans a total of 85.6 days , with a @xmath116 day gap during the first month due to a spacecraft safe mode ( see fig  [ fig : kepdata ] ) .    inspection of the raw data of hd185351  showed a considerable number of outliers below the average flux level .",
    "we attribute these outliers to the increased pointing jitter during q16 , causing the photocenter to move sporadically outside the dedicated pixel mask . to reject these outliers we calculated the flux difference of each consecutive data point pair for the full time series .",
    "then , all data points with a flux decrease greater than 3 times the standard deviation of the flux differences over the entire dataset were removed .",
    "this procedure was iterated until the residual scatter converged .",
    "finally , we applied a savitzky - golay filter with a width of 2 days to the light curve to remove any instrumental and intrinsic low - frequency variability that could influence the oscillation signal , and applied a 4@xmath9 clipping using a 1-day moving mean . the detrended light curve with and without the adopted outlier rejection is shown in figure [ fig : kepdata ] .",
    "we calculate the power spectrum from the detrended light curve using the method described by @xcite to model the background power due to stellar granulation and detect the signature of oscillations .",

    "one method , presented in   [ sec : sed ] , makes use of the stefan-boltzmann law , together with our measurements of the parallax - based distance , stellar angular diameter ( @xmath15 ) and bolometric flux ( @xmath71 ) , which gives @xmath32  @xmath157  k. we consider this method to be empirical in that it relies only weakly model - based assumptions ( e.g. limb - darkening ) , and it sidesteps the intricacies and assumptions employed in modeling the observed stellar spectrum , which often relies on the assumption of plane - parallel atmospheres in lte , among other simplifications .",
    "the star s spectral energy distribution is used to estimate the bolometric flux , but we do so using observed stellar spectra of stars with well - measured @xmath71 , rather than relying on synthetic spectra . however , checking our result based on empirical spectra against model spectra shows close agreement (   [ sec : sed ] ) .",
    "we find very close agreement between our sed - based measurement of the effective temperature , and that of our sme analysis .",
    "this bolsters the reliability of previous estimates of giant and subgiant stellar properties using lte spectral modeling since systematic errors in @xmath32  can lead to large errors in @xmath19  and @xmath67  ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "our lte spectral synthesis modeling is implemented using sme , which models the stellar surface gravity by fitting to the damping wings of the mgiib triplet lines @xcite .",
    "this method works well for @xmath31  @xmath158 , but the uncertainty increases for lower surface gravity due to significant weakening of the mgiib damping wings .",
    "also , @xmath31  is correlated with both @xmath32  and [ fe / h ] in sme , which can bias the model - grid - interpolated stellar mass @xcite .",

    "the fractional uncertainty on our sed - based @xmath32  is @xmath163% , and are therefore negligible compared to the measurement errors in our asteroseismic values of  and @xmath67 , which are 2.6% and 3.8% , respectively .",
    "just as with our estimates of @xmath32 , we find close agreement between our empirical measurement and model - based estimate of @xmath31 , which is remarkable given the low surface gravity of hd185351 .",

    "[ sec : astero ] , we also measured the stellar radius using our asteroseismic measurements under the constraints provided by our sme - based metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) and the basti stellar evolution models .",

    "this value agrees well with our asteroseismic - only measurement made by combining equations  [ eqn : dnu ] and [ eqn : numax ] ( @xmath19  @xmath173  @xmath6 ) .",
    "we also find close agreement with the mass measured by interpolating the asteroseismic @xmath31  and @xmath96 , plus the spectroscopic [ fe / h ] and @xmath32 , onto the basti model grids ( @xmath19  @xmath174  @xmath6 ) .",
    "this second model - based procedure is illustrated in figure  [ fig : concordance ] in the region of overlap among the asteroseismic parameters and sed @xmath32 .",
    "we also estimated the stellar mass by combining the asteroseismic density calculated from the large frequency spacing  ( cf equation  [ eqn : dnu ] ) with the interferometric radius .",
    "this is our least model - dependent estimate of the stellar mass in that it is independent of any aspect of our sme spectral analysis and evolution models , which are under scrutiny in this study .",
    "we find @xmath19  @xmath175@xmath6 , which is smaller than our sme model - based value by 2.6@xmath9 .",
    "the value is also smaller than the mass derived from asteroseismic scaling relations ( by 1.6@xmath9 ) , asteroseismic scaling relations combined with basti models ( by 1.8@xmath9 ) , and the mass implied from the gravity mode period spacing .    as illustrated in our concordance diagram ( figure 7 ) ,",
    "the mass difference could be reconciled either by a systematic increase in the interferometric radius ( upward shift of blue band ) or a systematic increase in  and  ( downward shift of red and green bands ) .",
    "the required offsets in measured quantities are a @xmath1105% decrease in the parallax , a @xmath1106% increase in angular diameter , or a 9% increase in  and .",
    "hd185351  is a photometric standard star with no indication of a binary companion , and hence a systematic error in the hipparcos parallax is unlikely . while angular diameters can be affected by systematic calibration errors , the agreement of our estimates using two different instruments and different calibrators rule out a shift as a large as 6% .",
    "corrections to asteroseismic scaling relations for stars that are more evolved than the sun have been proposed , but so far theoretical investigations and empirical tests have ruled out offsets as large as 9% for  and . in summary , the tension between the our lowest mass measurement and other estimates is likely not due to a systematic error in one of the adopted methods , but could be due to a combined effect of small offsets in the different measurements .",
    "another possible explanation for the disagreement stems from the different methods we used to measure the stellar radius .",
    "interferometry , together with the parallax  based distance , provides a measure of the rosseland , or",
    "mean emitting surface of the star , which roughly corresponds to the point at which the optical depth @xmath176 . the radius measured from asteroseismology corresponds to the radial location where pressure waves are reflected back into the stellar interior .",
    "this occurs where the frequency of the pressure wave is smaller than the acoustic cut - off frequency , @xmath99 , which for isothermal conditions depends on the sound speed and the pressure scale height ( see   [ sec : background ] ) . if the point in the stellar interior where @xmath177 differs from the location of the @xmath176 surface , then our two methods of measuring the stellar radius will differ .    to investigate this possibility",
    ", we examined the interior structure of a mesa model of a giant star similar to hd185351 , specifically the acoustic cutoff frequency and mean emitting surface in the outer 1% of its radius . we find that the @xmath177 surface is slightly below the @xmath176 surface",
    "however , the difference is only 0.1% , well below our measurement uncertainties . while this result is model  dependent , it is unlikely that the true difference is more than an order of magnitude larger than this , which is the amount required to explain the discrepancy between our various radius , and hence mass , measurements",
    "our knowledge of the masses and radii of the vast majority of stars in the galaxy rests on our theoretical understanding of stellar atmospheres and stellar evolution . for example",
    ", the process of measuring the mass of an isolated star typically begins with a measure of its effective temperature and metallicity from its observed spectrum , and its parallax - based luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for stars lacking a precise distance estimate , a spectroscopically - measured surface gravity ( @xmath31 ) , or its stellar density ( @xmath96 ) , can serve as a proxy for luminosity ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these properties define the star s location within the theoretical herzsprung  russell diagram , which in turn depends on the star s evolutionary state as dictated by its mass , chemical composition and age .",
    "theoretical h ",
    "r diagrams have been computed by many groups by integrating the equations of stellar structure forward in time with various initial stellar masses and chemical compositions , and the results are tabulated in what are commonly referred to as stellar evolution model grids ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus , a star s mass can be estimated by interpolating its observed properties onto these grids and recording the corresponding stellar mass , as well as other physical properties such as radius , mean density , internal structure ( e.g. core helium fraction ) and age ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "r diagram that lie far from the sun s position or for stars with different chemical compositions , theoretical atmosphere and evolution models are less robust . in these regions",
    "it is important to gather independent measurements of stellar physical characteristics that can be used to critically examine model predictions and provide touchstones for studies of stars of similar types .",
    "our study focuses on an evolved star , hd185351 which is one of several giant stars targeted by the doppler - based planet survey of @xcite .",
    "stars such as hd185351  may be proxies of more massive main - sequence stars that are not amenable to precision doppler - shift measurements owing to their rotationally - broadened absorption features . after evolving off of the main sequence , massive , hot stars shed most of their angular momentum and cool down , making them better targets for doppler surveys . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have reported an apparent increase in the occurrence rate of giant planets around evolved stars more massive than the sun .",
    "this has been interpreted as support for the core accretion theory of planet formation since the disks around more massive stars presumably contain more mass , and hence more of the building blocks for the protoplanetary cores that eventually become gas giants .",
    "however , the masses of these evolved stars have been called into question , raising concerns that giant stars like hd185351 , which have model - grid - based masses in excess of 1.5  @xmath6 , may in fact have masses comparable to sun - like dwarfs @xcite . if this were the case , then the apparent enhanced planet occurrence rate observed around subgiant and giant stars discovered by would require critical reexamination and perhaps a different interpretation .",
    "there are two likely sources of systematic errors in estimating the masses of giant stars like hd185351 .",
    "the first is in the measurement of atmospheric parameters ( @xmath32 , @xmath31 , [ fe / h ] ) by fitting lte spectral models to observed spectra , which in our case is performed using the widely - used sme software package @xcite .",
    "if the effective temperature measured using this technique were off by , e.g. , 200  k then the inferred stellar mass from evolutionary models would be in error by as much as 0.3  @xmath6 , or 20% at the base of the red giant branch .",
    "a similar systematic error in the stellar mass would result from a 0.2  dex inaccuracy in @xmath31 .",
    "our study suggests that systematic errors in the effective temperature and surface gravity measured using sme are much smaller than 200  k and 0.2  dex , respectively .",
    "indeed , our temperature measured from a combination of the interferometric stellar radius and bolometric luminosity agrees to well within errors with the temperature from sme .",
    "similarly , the sme - based surface gravity agrees within errors with the asteroseismic @xmath31  estimated from the observed frequency of maximum oscillation power .    the second potential source of error in measuring the mass of giant stars is in the interpolation of the atmospheric properties onto stellar evolution model grids .",
    "improper treatment of core overshoot , the convective mixing length parameter or other subtleties in the evolution of giant stars may lead to an inaccurate mapping of stellar physical characteristics such as mass and radius to observed properties such as luminosity , metallicity and effective temperature .",
    "we tested the veracity of the model grids by comparing the model - grid interpolated mass and radius of hd185351  to the mass and radius measured from asteroseismology and interferometry , respectively .    interpolating the spectroscopic parameters of hd185351  onto the yonsei - yale model grids",
    "results in a mass of @xmath178  @xmath6 .",
    "the observed large frequency spacing and frequency of maximum oscillation observed in our _ kepler _  photometry yield a mass that agrees well with this estimate , giving @xmath179  @xmath6 .",
    "while stellar evolution models require assumptions about the complicated interplay of the interior structure of stars and the radiative transfer processes occurring in the stellar photosphere , asteroseismology provides direct measures of the bulk properties of the star , namely the mean density and surface gravity , which in turn are related to the stellar mass and radius .",
    "thus , the agreement between our asteroseismic mass and radius and that predicted by a combination of atmospheric parameters and stellar evolution models indicates that the models are not plagued by large systematic errors .",
    "our observation of mixed p and g  modes in the oscillation spectrum of hd185351  provides another asteroseismic mass estimate .",
    "the period spacing of the mixed modes , @xmath180 , can be compared to the predictions of interior structure models ( cf   [ sec : mixedmodes ] ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : dpidnu ] , our observed period spacing is consistent with the mass measured from evolution model grids and asteroseismic scaling relations . these predictions , while based on interior structure models , are independent from the scaling relations used to relate the other asteroseismic parameters to stellar mass and radius . thus , we have two independent measures of the stellar mass that agree with the mass found from model grid interpolation .",
    "we find some tension , at the 2.6@xmath9 level , to our least model - dependent mass measurement based on a combination of our interferometric radius and the density from asteroseismology .",
    "this disagreement stems primarily from a smaller radius measured from interferometry compared to the radius measured from asteroseismology .",
    "it may be that our other independent mass measurements contain independent systematic errors that result in a mass that is incorrect .",
    "alternatively , the difference could be due to a combination of small biases in the  scaling relation used to derive the mean stellar density and the measured angular diameter .",
    "additionally , there may also exist systematic errors at the @xmath181% level in the model grids which contribute to this difference .",
    "it is possible that our sample of one just happens to have an interferometric mass estimate that is low due to statistical errors .",
    "the disagreement between some of our independent mass estimates motivates further investigation using the observational techniques described herein .",

    "<S> asteroseismic oscillations detected in the _ kepler _  short - cadence photometry combined with an effective temperature calculated from the interferometric angular diameter and bolometric flux yield a mean density , @xmath0  @xmath1 and surface gravity , @xmath2 . combining the gravity and density we find @xmath3  @xmath4  and @xmath5  @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the trigonometric parallax and chara angular diameter give a radius @xmath7  @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this smaller radius , when combined with the mean stellar density , corresponds to a stellar mass @xmath8  @xmath6 , which is smaller than the asteroseismic mass by 1.6@xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a larger mass is supported by the observation of mixed modes in our high - precision photometry , the spacing of which is consistent only for @xmath10  @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> our various and independent mass measurements can be compared to the mass measured from interpolating the spectroscopic parameters onto stellar evolution models , which yields a model - based mass @xmath11  @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this mass agrees well with the asteroseismic value , but is 2.6@xmath9 higher than the mass from the combination of asteroseismology and interferometry . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy motivates future studies with a larger sample of giant stars . </S>",
    "<S> however , all of our mass measurements are consistent with hd185351   having a mass in excess of 1.5  @xmath6 . </S>"
