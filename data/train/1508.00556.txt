    "many applications involve the simulation of wave propagation phenomena in media with piecewise constant material characteristics that can be modeled by elliptic partial differential equations with piecewise constant coefficients . in such situations ,",
    "the computational domain is naturally partitioned into sub - domains corresponding to the values of material characteristics .    as regards numerical approaches to be used to tackle wave propagation problems ,",
    "although one may opt for finite elements or similar volume methods , boundary integral equation methods provide accurate alternatives that are less prone to such undesirable effects as numerical dispersion .",
    "admittedly discretization of boundary integral equations leads to dense ill conditioned matrices which raises numerical challenges and requires careful implementation , but many progresses achieved in the past decade ( efficient preconditioners , fast multipole methods , adapted quadrature techniques ) now place boundary integral equation techniques as a serious numerical alternative for high performance computations .    in the context of parallel computing , it becomes desirable to embed integral equation methods into a domain decomposition paradigm .",
    "the boundary element tearing and interconnecting method ( beti ) was developed in this spirit , more than a decade ago , as an integral equation counterpart of the feti method , see @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach dubbed multi - trace formalism , leading to different solvers , was introduced a few years ago @xcite , providing other boundary integral formulations adapted to multi - domain geometrical configurations .",

    "a precise knowledge of the spectral structure of the equation under consideration is most of the time a key ingredient for devising efficient domain decomposition strategies .",
    "the main purpose of the present contribution is thus to provide results concerning the spectrum of local multi - trace operators .",
    "in particular we describe the spectrum through an explicit formula in the case where the propagation medium admits uniform characteristic material parameters , which yields the location of the accumulation points of the spectrum of local multi - trace operators in the general case of piecewise varying effective wave numbers .",
    "in addition , the present contribution provides a proof of the well posedness of the local multi - trace formulations in the case of non - trivial relaxation parameters , which was mentioned in ( * ? ? ? * rem.2 ) as an open problem .",
    "the present contribution is organized as follows . in the first section",
