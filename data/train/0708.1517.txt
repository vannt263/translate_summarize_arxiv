    "in the last decade , the advent of new precise cosmological observations coming mainly from measurements of fluctuations in the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) and the large scale structure of the universe ( lss ) , have shown a dramatic improvement .",
    "this has revolutionized our knowledge of the values of the basic cosmological parameters which are constrained to an accuracy of around 10% @xcite .    in particular , the measurements of large scale galaxy clustering place important constraints on cosmological parameters that complement those from the analysis of fluctuations in the cmb .",
    "measurements of the galaxy power spectrum constrain the parameter combinations @xmath1 and @xmath2 . the constraint on @xmath1 is particularly important as , for instance , it breaks a degeneracy in the cmb data and allows accurate determination of @xmath3 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ".    in view of these rapid improvements in the amount and quality of the observations the control of the systematic effects introduced in the analysis pipeline becomes increasingly important .",
    "new experiments and surveys are being planned which will push the level of precision of the constraints on cosmological parameters even further .",
    "thus it is necessary to establish how robust the constraints really are with respect to the details of the hypothesis implemented to establish the link between theory and observations .",
    "the tension found between the constraints coming from the published analysis of the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) of @xcite and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) of @xcite might be an indication of possible systematic effects . in figure  16a of @xcite , which compares the published estimates of the galaxy power spectra",
    ", there is evidence of more large scale power in the 2dfgrs than in sdss .",
    "this folds through and results in the headline value of @xmath4 from 2dfgrs @xcite being lower than that of @xcite sdss , @xmath5 .",
    "here , one should be cautious as different priors have been assumed , but in the analysis of @xcite , which treats each dataset on an equal footing and separately combines each with cmb data , one sees in their figure  18 that the sdss prefers a substantially higher value of @xmath3 than does the 2dfgrs .",
    "in fact , while the 2dfgrs estimate is in good agreement with that from the cmb data alone ( it significantly tightens the constraint without shifting the best fitting value ) the sdss data pull @xmath3 to higher values than preferred by the cmb .",
    "the 2dfgrs and sdss are the largest redshift surveys available and give the most detailed description of the large scale structure of the universe as traced by galaxies . hence to be sure that systematic errors are not biasing the parameters it is very useful to see each data set subjected to analysis by a variety of algorithms and codes , as happened following the @xcite 2dfgrs power - spectrum analysis @xcite .",
    "@xcite computed the power spectrum of a combined main galaxy and luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) sample drawn from sdss data release 5 using a similar technique to that of @xcite and found an even higher value of the matter density @xmath6 , suggesting that the inclusion of the lrgs in the analysis increase the discrepancy between 2dfgrs and sdss .",
    "their results also show that if the analysis is restricted to large scales ( @xmath7 ) the data favours a lower matter density @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite suggested that these differences could be explained by scale - dependent galaxy bias on large scales , but found no significant evidence of it .",
    "here we seek to investigate whether these differences are as a result of : a )  larger than expected cosmic variance , b )  systematics due to differences in the analysis technique c )  systematics due to problems with galaxy catalogues or d ) intrinsic differences in the underlying galaxy clustering . in order to directly compare the 2dfgrs and sdss , we analyse each dataset using essentially identical methods which we outline in section  [ sec : method ] . in section  [ sec : overlap ] , we briefly look at the region of overlap between the surveys to study the different selections used and the level of incompleteness . in section  [ sec :",
    "pkcomparison ] , we compare the resulting power spectra from the full catalogues and interpret the differences . section  [ sec : pkconstraints ] presents a detailed analysis of the implications of the differences between these datasets in the obtained constraints on cosmological parameters , and the systematic effects that might be introduced by the analysis .",
    "finally , we conclude in section  [ sec : conc ]",
    "the 2dfgrs covers approximately 1800 square degrees distributed between two broad strips , one across the south galactic pole ( sgp ) and the other close to the north galactic pole ( ngp ) , plus a set of 99 random 2 degree fields spread over the full southern galactic cap .",
    "the final catalogue contains reliable redshifts for 221414 galaxies selected to an extinction - corrected magnitude limit of approximately @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the 2dfgrs samples analysed here are the same as described in detail in @xcite .",
    "our method of estimating the galaxy power spectrum and determining statistical errors is essentially identical to that set out in @xcite , but with two minor changes . in brief :    we use masks , whose construction is described in @xcite , to describe the angular variation of the survey magnitude limit , redshift completeness and magnitude dependence of the redshift completeness .",
    "random catalogues are generated by sampling from the luminosity function and viewing through the masks . to generate random catalogues corresponding to red / blue subsets ,",
    "the luminosity function of only the red / blue galaxies is used .",
    "close pair incompleteness due to `` fibre collisions '' is dealt with by redistributing the weights of missed galaxies to their 10 nearest neighbours on the sky .",
    "the power spectrum is estimated using a simple cubic fft method with the optimal weighting scheme of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter pvp ) and then spherically averaged in redshift space . as in @xcite , the assumed linear empirical bias factors that are used in this weighting scheme are @xmath10 for rest frame",
    "@xmath11 , and @xmath12 for rest frame @xmath13 .",
    "these are based on the scale - independent bias parameter found by norberg et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , modified to describe the difference in amplitudes of the power spectra of red and blue galaxies around @xmath14 . this simple description of the luminosity and colour dependence of galaxy bias is in agreement with the results of @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the effect on the recovered power spectrum of using ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter fkp ) rather than the pvp estimator is small ( see their figures  17(s ) and ( t ) ) .",
    "the fkp estimator is biased , as it ignores the luminosity dependence of galaxy clustering .",
    "provided the model of luminosity - dependent bias is correct , then the pvp estimator removes this bias .",
    "a more complicated recipe for the luminosity and colour dependence of galaxy bias can be applied but , as long as the assumed bias is scale independent ( a necessary assumption in our method of analysis ) it will hardly change the shape of the estimated power spectrum , as the effect will be significantly smaller than the difference between the fkp and pvp estimates and so entirely negligible .    the covariance matrix describing the errors on the power spectrum measurements and their correlations is estimated using mock catalogues which are constructed from the random catalogues by generating a log - normal density field with a specified power spectrum and using it to modulate the selection of galaxies from the random catalogue .",
    "thus , by construction , these catalogues have a power spectrum very close to the best fitting model and have luminosity and colour dependent clustering consistent with the bias factors of equations  ( [ eqn : bias ] ) and  ( [ eqn : bias_red ] ) .",
    "the survey window function is determined directly from the random catalogue .",
    "when fitting models the theoretical model power spectra are convolved with the survey window function .",
    "the two minor changes we have made are :    * we have adopted a simpler binning scheme so that now @xmath15 is estimated in bins uniformly spaced in @xmath16 , rather than the linearly space bins with different bin widths in different ranges of @xmath17 that were used in @xcite .",
    "* we used new sets of log - normal catalogues in which the modulation of the density field used for galaxies with different bias factors is linear rather than the slightly more complicated scheme that was employed by @xcite .     galaxy sample ( solid line ) .",
    "the dashed line shows an analytic fit to the data .",
    "the dot - dashed line is this same fit scaled down in amplitude to be always below the redshift histogram .",
    "this fit is used to generate the corresponding random catalogue by sampling from the original survey as described in the text .",
    ", scaledwidth=49.0% ]      we have analysed the sdss data release 5 ( dr5 ) sample @xcite , which is considerably larger than the dr3 sample analysed by @xcite . in most respects our analysis of the sdss",
    "is identical to that of the 2dfgrs .",
    "the only differences are a simpler way of generating the survey masks and of populating the corresponding random catalogue .",
    "the sky coverage mask we have adopted for the sdss - dr5 data is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mask ] and compared with corresponding 2dfgrs mask .",
    "we constructed this mask by simply noting the angular coverage of each of the stripes from which the sdss survey is built and by removing a few small regions with poor coverage .",
    "most of the sdss survey goes to a uniform magnitude limit of @xmath18 , but a sub - area , which is easily identified using the target selection date , has a variety of different magnitude limits .",
    "in this sub - area we simply imposed a fixed magnitude limit of @xmath19 and discarded all galaxies fainter than this limit .",
    "the number of galaxies with redshifts that are retained by the mask and magnitude limits and used in our analysis is @xmath20 .",
    "the mask is cruder than the more sophisticated ones employed by @xcite and for the 2dfgrs as it ignores the smaller scale variation in the redshift completeness .",
    "however in the case of the 2dfgrs , where the incompleteness variation is much larger , @xcite showed that provided this incompleteness is accounted for using our method of redistributing the weights of galaxies without redshifts to neighbours with redshifts , the resulting power spectrum estimates are very accurate ( see their figure  17 g ) .",
    "as most of the catalogue goes uniformly to the deeper magnitude limit a simple method can be used to construct the random catalogue .",
    "[ fig : dndz ] shows the redshift distribution of this sample ( solid line ) together with an analytic fit ( dashed line ) that smoothes away the effect of large scale clustering .",
    "our procedure is :    1 .",
    "select a random direction on the sky .",
    "2 .   choose at random a genuine galaxy from the region of the survey that goes to @xmath18 .",
    "3 .   keep the galaxy with a probability proportional to the ratio of the fit scaled down in amplitude to be always below the redshift histogram ( shown as the dot - dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : dndz ] ) to that of the actual height of the redshift histogram at the redshift of the selected galaxy .",
    "this effectively adjusts the sampling of the different redshifts to erase the effect of large scale clustering .",
    "4 .   keep or discard the galaxy based on the sky coverage and magnitude limit of the mask .",
    "( note , for galaxies that fall where the magnitude limit is only @xmath21 , the fainter galaxies will be discarded and the redshift distribution of the retained galaxies will be appropriately shallower than that of fig .  [",
    "fig : dndz ] . )",
    "these steps are done repeatedly until a random catalogue containing @xmath22 times more galaxies than the genuine catalogue is built up .",
    "selecting from the genuine catalogue in this way means we automatically have apparent magnitudes and colours for all the galaxies in the random catalogue and so can select sub - samples from it and weight its galaxies in just the same way as the genuine catalogue .    to utilize the @xcite optimum weighting we need to determine bias factors for the galaxies in the genuine , random and mock catalogues .",
    "we do this by first converting the sdss magnitudes to the 2dfgrs @xmath23 and @xmath24 bands using @xmath25 and the simple colour dependent @xmath17-corrections that were used for the 2dfgrs data ( see section  3 of * ? ? ?",
    "then we are able to define the bias factors using equations  ( [ eqn : bias ] ) and  ( [ eqn : bias_red ] ) just as for the 2dfgrs data .",
    "our main focus is the comparison of the power spectra of the two surveys , but we first directly compare the two surveys in the region of their overlap to get a feel for the different selections used and the level of incompleteness .    in the northern galactic hemisphere there is a contiguous area of overlap between the two surveys , which runs for @xmath26  degrees of ra and is for the most part @xmath27  degrees wide in declination .",
    "if we select from the sdss photometric catalogue all galaxies brighter than @xmath28 ( we do not apply the @xmath29 magnitude limit of the sdss main galaxy survey , but we do apply all the other star - galaxy classification criteria used in that sample ( see * ? ? ? * ) ) , then in this area there are @xmath30 galaxies that are in both catalogues .",
    "we find the fraction of sdss galaxies which are also in the 2dfgrs to be constant at @xmath31% as faint as @xmath32 .",
    "fainter than this , sdss galaxies are missing from the 2dfgrs sample simply due to the ( variable ) magnitude limit of the 2dfgrs survey and its @xmath33  magnitude random photometric errors .",
    "this finding is in perfect accord with the estimates made with the sdss edr @xcite in @xcite .",
    "this @xmath34% incompleteness has been investigated by @xcite as well as @xcite and has been shown to be predominately due to incorrect star - galaxy classification .",
    "the star - galaxy classification parameters based on the apm photometry are noisy and this level of incompleteness is in line with what was expected @xcite .    the issue here is whether this incompleteness has any influence on estimates of galaxy clustering .",
    "we can look at this directly by plotting cone plots ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cones ] ) of the galaxies the two catalogues have in common and those missed by the 2dfgrs .",
    "we plot only galaxies with @xmath35 to avoid issues with the 2dfgrs magnitude limit .",
    "we see that @xmath36% of the sdss galaxies are in the 2dfgrs .",
    "comparing the two cone plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : cones ] , it appears that the galaxies missed by 2dfgrs are just a random sparse sampling of the structure seen in the matching sample and so there is no evidence that the incompleteness has a spatial imprint .     as a function of @xmath37 to our individual band power",

    "the power spectra we estimate using the methods outlined in section  [ sec : method ] are the direct transform of the data , and are thus what cmb researchers would term a pseudo - spectrum . as such",
    ", it yields a convolution of the underlying galaxy power spectrum with the modulus squared of the fourier transform of the window function of either the sdss or 2dfgrs as appropriate , that is @xmath39 our random catalogues allow us to accurately estimate @xmath40 and from it determine the matrix of window functions that describe how our spherically averaged band power estimates @xmath38 are related to the unconvolved power spectrum @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 examples of these window functions for the sdss and 2dfgrs are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wins ] . for all our quantitative analysis in section  [ sec : pkconstraints ] we use these window functions to convolve the model power spectra before comparing with the data .",
    "however for the purposes of visually comparing the 2dfgrs and sdss power spectra we have corrected the convolved estimates by multiplying them through by the ratio of a similar model power spectrum to its convolved counterpart .",
    "this ` deconvolution ' is accurate provided the power spectra are smooth .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : pk_all ] we compare the ` deconvolved ' power spectra estimated from the full 2dfgrs catalogue and full sdss - dr5 sample .",
    "we note that the sdss and 2dfgrs galaxy power spectra agree well for @xmath43 .",
    "the good agreement in amplitude at this wavenumber is due to the bias dependent weights used in the pvp estimator which have successfully modelled the difference in the clustering strength of the red selected sdss galaxies and blue selected 2dfgrs galaxies .",
    "this is by design as the bias factors were normalized empirically by the 2dfgrs red and blue samples at this scale ( see figure  15 of * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , on larger scales we see evidence for significantly more large scale power in the 2dfgrs than in sdss .",
    "this clearly shows that the difference between the sdss and 2dfgrs results that was noted in the introduction and which motivated this analysis is certainly significant and not an artifact of differing analysis techniques .",

    "[ fig : varq](a ) and ( b ) we note that the correction factor of equation  ( [ eq : nonlin ] ) is not able to reconcile the constraints obtained from the 2dfgrs and sdss power spectra .",
    "the constraints on the @xmath118 plane exhibit a similar behaviour to the case where the value of @xmath54 was held fixed .",
    "this shows that the non - linearities and scale dependent bias of the @xmath0-selected sdss galaxies distort the shape of the power spectrum in a way that can not be described accurately by equation  ( [ eq : nonlin ] ) .",
    "contrary to what was expected , the constraints on the plane @xmath119 show that sdss and 2dfgrs select different values of @xmath1 but a similar allowed region for @xmath54 .",
    "then , even incorporating this model of the distortion into the methodology for constraining cosmological parameters , the use of a red sample of galaxies introduces strong systematics effects on the resulting parameter constraints .    intriguingly , the constraints on @xmath1 and @xmath2 obtained using the lrg power spectrum lie well within the 2dfgrs contours , in perfect agreement with the results obtained using cmb data",
    "this means that the difference in the shape of the sdss - lrg and 2dfgrs power spectra is completely consistent with equation  ( [ eq : nonlin ] ) .",
    "both datasets can be accurately described with the same values of the cosmological parameters , but with a much higher value of @xmath120 for the sdss - lrg sample , in agreement with the results of @xcite .        as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : varq](c ) and ( d ) , the situation is similar for the constraints obtained using the power spectra of the red 2dfgrs and sdss galaxy samples . as in the case of a fixed value of @xmath54",
    ", the constraints obtained with the 2dfgrs power spectrum are shifted from its region of agreement with the cmb towards the values preferred by the sdss . with the addition of @xmath54 , the extra degree of freedom",
    "gives rise to a degeneracy that involves @xmath1 and @xmath54 .",
    "these two parameters act in opposite ways which allows them to compensate each others effect on the theoretical power spectrum .",
    "this degeneracy can not be broken by the power spectrum of the red 2dfgrs galaxies and results in a considerable increase of the allowed region for the different parameters .",
    "the breakdown of the simple model of equation  ( [ eq : nonlin ] ) in describing the differences in the clustering of red and blue galaxies can be more clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] , which shows the different power spectra analysed in this work divided by a reference power spectrum @xmath121 computed using the best fit cosmological parameters from @xcite .",
    "assuming this is the true cosmology , if there were no distortions in the shape of @xmath15 , the different measurements should lie over the dashed line of @xmath122 .",
    "the difference in the shapes of these spectra is a clear demonstration of the fact that scale dependent bias and nonlinearities are a function of galaxy type .",
    "the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] show the shape distortion model of equation  ( [ eq : nonlin ] ) for the specified value of @xmath54 . with a value of @xmath123",
    "this correction gives a good description of the distortions in the power spectrum of the 2dfgrs , with a small decrease in the amplitude of @xmath15 at intermediate scales and an increase at small scales .",
    "the same correction factor can reproduce the effect of the larger non - linearities of the lrg power spectrum , but with a much higher value of @xmath124 .",
    "despite its success at describing the 2dfgrs and lrg power spectra , equation  ( [ eq : nonlin ] ) fails to reproduce the shape of the sdss power spectrum , which exhibits a different behavior as a function of @xmath17 and can not be fitted by this simple model .",
    "the fact that the power spectrum of the red galaxies from 2dfgrs is distorted in a similar fashion indicates that , as was found in section  [ sec : pkcomparison ] , red selected galaxy samples exhibit stronger scale dependent galaxy bias . for comparison ,",
    "[ fig : ratio ] also shows that the power spectrum of sdss dr3 measured by @xcite suffers from the same effect .",
    "this clearly shows that , in order to obtain unbiased constraints on cosmological parameters it is necessary to better understand and constrain the distortion in the shape of the power spectrum caused by nonlinearity and scale dependent bias .",
    "in this section we analyse the effect of including the damping of the acoustic oscillations into our modelling of @xmath15 .",
    "this case mimics the analysis of @xcite of the lrg power spectrum .",
    "although we only use information from the shape of the galaxy power spectrum , when this effect is included in our modelling of @xmath15 the amplitude @xmath68 enters in the constraints marginally , since the value of the damping scale @xmath61 depends on this parameter @xcite .",
    "as can be seen in the last column of table  [ tab : params ] this addition does not change the differences between 2dfgrs and sdss .",
    "the main effect of this is the increase of the allowed regions of the different cosmological parameters .",
    "as the oscillations are damped , models with higher values of @xmath2 , which according to linear theory exhibit larger amplitude oscillations , are now compatible with the data .",
    "this causes the signal of the oscillations to effectively loose the power to constrain efficiently the values of the parameters , which in this case are determined almost completely by the overall shape of @xmath15 .",
    "the details of the way in which the oscillations are damped and the correct way to model it are the main focus of several recent studies @xcite .",
    "although substantial progress has been made in this subject , it is not completely understood . this is then another example of how the details of the modelling used to fit theoretical models may introduce systematic effects which may cause significant differences in the obtained constraints .",
    "in this paper we studied in detail the differences between the constraints on cosmological parameters coming from the 2dfgrs and sdss power spectra .",
    "we have analysed both the 2dfgrs and sdss dr5 catalogues using essentially identical techniques .",
    "the main conclusion of this investigation is that a significant difference exists between the shape of the galaxy power spectra measured in the 2dfgrs and sdss main galaxy sample and that this difference is due to scale dependent bias .",
    "our results extend those of @xcite who found that the inclusion of the lrgs in the analysis increases the discrepancy between 2dfgrs and sdss .",
    "their findings also showed that if linear cdm fits are restricted to large scales ( @xmath7 ) , sdss data also favours a lower matter density @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite suggested that a scale - dependent bias which depends on the @xmath0-band luminosity of the galaxies could explain these differences , but found no significant evidence of it .",
    "if a homogeneous sample of red galaxies is selected from each survey then the resulting power spectra agree to within the expected statistical errors .",
    "in contrast , when the full 2dfgrs and sdss catalogues are analyzed the resulting 2dfgrs power spectrum differs in shape to that of sdss . if normalized on scales around @xmath125 , as is done automatically by the scale independent bias factors assumed in the pvp estimator , then the 2dfgrs @xmath15 exhibits more large scale power than sdss .",
    "however , if one instead normalizes on large scales one finds the equivalent result that sdss exhibits more small scale power than 2dfgrs .",
    "this behaviour is exactly what one expects if the more strongly clustered red galaxies live in denser environments where the effects of nonlinearity are greater .",
    "we have obtained constraints on the parameter combinations @xmath1 and @xmath2 which are the most important parameters to characterize the full shape of @xmath15 .",
    "the constraints obtained by fitting the sdss and 2dfgrs data show that the difference between the sdss and 2dfgrs results which motivated this analysis is significant and is not due to the differing analysis techniques .",
    "if not accounted for , the difference between these datasets introduces a systematic effect that bias the obtained constraints on cosmological parameters , whose effect is larger than the uncertainty with which they are determined .",
    "@xcite introduced a first attempt at modelling the distortion in the shape of the power spectrum caused by nonlinearity and scale dependent bias using the @xmath54 and @xmath74 parameters of equation  ( [ eq : nonlin ] ) . for the mix of red and blue galaxies",
    "present in the 2dfgrs survey , the necessary value of @xmath54 was reasonably small and hence the scale dependent correction quite modest .",
    "the same correction factor has been applied to samples of redder or more luminous and hence more clustered galaxies where one expects greater nonlinearity .",
    "we found that the correction factor of equation  ( [ eq : nonlin ] ) is not able to reconcile the constraints obtained from the 2dfgrs and sdss power spectra .",
    "this shows that this simple correction can not describe the effect of non - linearities and scale dependent bias for a general sample of galaxies .",
    "intriguingly , the same model can describe correctly the difference in the shape of the power spectra from 2dfgrs and the much strongly clustered sdss - lrg sample .",
    "both datasets can be described with the same values of the cosmological parameters , but with a much higher value of @xmath120 for the sdss - lrg sample .",
    "this comparison has revealed that to get unbiased estimates of the cosmological parameters it is necessary to better understand and constrain the different processes that shape the galaxy power spectrum .",
    "thus to get robust constraints from the main sdss survey and from future galaxy surveys like pan - starrs , or the dark energy survey , which will use selection criteria similar to the one of sdss , will require more detailed modelling of nonlinearity and scale dependent bias .",
