    "hadronic matter is expected to undergo a phase transition to quark matter at high temperature and/or high baryon density .",
    "quark matter may exist in the core of neutron star where the density is high or it may be produced in the laboratory in heavy ion collisions . in quark matter , the presence of a weak attraction between the quarks will result in the formation of a condensate of quark pairs .",
    "pairs of quarks can not be color singlets , and in qcd with two flavors of massless quarks , the cooper pairs favor the formation of a color @xmath1 , flavor singlet condensate .",
    "the color superconductivity of quark matter has been discussed in many places in the literature ( see for example @xcite - @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the phase diagram for chiral symmetry restoration , including possible color superconductivity , for quark matter containing just u and d quarks , was discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , where a rich phase structure was obtained .",
    "it was shown that at high temperature , chiral symmetry was restored via a second - order phase transition . at low temperature ,",
    "the phase transition was first order and at this time , a new phase with a condensate of cooper pairs appeared .",
    "however , we should notice that this phase transition is not a transition from hadronic matter to quark matter but a transition from chiral symmetry breaking quark matter to chiral symmetry restored quark matter .",
    "we know that in the real world , there is no quark matter at low density and temperature , rather the chiral symmetry breaking quark matter should be replaced by hadronic matter .",
    "therefore , when studying the phase diagram , the equations of state ( eos ) of hadronic matter are needed .    to study the properties of hadronic matter we need phenomenological models , since qcd can not yet be used directly .",
    "the symmetries of qcd can be used to constrain the hadronic interactions and models based on @xmath2 symmetry and scale invariance have been proposed .",
    "these effective models have been widely used to investigate nuclear matter and finite nuclei , both at zero and at finite temperature @xcite-@xcite .",
    "papazoglou @xmath3 @xmath4 extended the chiral effective models to @xmath5 , including the baryon octet@xcite . as well as models based on hadronic degrees of freedom , there are others based on quark degrees of freedom , such as the quark meson coupling model @xcite , the cloudy bag model @xcite , the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite and the quark mean field model @xcite , @xmath6 .",
    "several years ago , a chiral @xmath7 quark mean field model based on quark degrees of freedom was proposed by wang @xmath3 @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite . in this model",
    ", quarks are confined in the baryons by an effective potential . the quark - meson interaction and meson self - interaction",
    "are based on @xmath7 chiral symmetry . through the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking the resulting constituent quarks and mesons ( except for the pseudoscalars )",
    "obtain masses .",
    "the introduction of an explicit symmetry breaking term in the meson self - interaction generates the masses of the pseudoscalar mesons , which satisfy the relevant pcac relations .",
    "the explicit symmetry breaking term in the quark - meson interaction gives reasonable hyperon potentials in hadronic matter .",
    "this chiral @xmath7 quark mean field model has been applied to investigate nuclear matter @xcite , strange hadronic matter @xcite , finite nuclei , hypernuclei @xcite , and quark matter @xcite .",
    "recently , we improved the chiral @xmath7 quark mean field model by using a microscopically justified treatment of the center of mass correction  @xcite .",
    "this new treatment has been applied to the study of the liquid - gas phase transition of asymmetric nuclear matter as well as strange hadronic matter @xcite . by and large",
    "the results are in reasonable agreement with existing experimental data .    as we know",
    ", the phase transition between hadronic matter and quark matter can only occur at high density or temperature .",
    "as the density grows , one expects that the nucleons will begin to overlap .",
    "this is expected to be a source of short distance repulsion and correlations .",
    "such effects are also encountered in atomic physics and a method of estimating the effect was introduced in ref .",
    "this was later applied in the context of dense nuclear matter by  @xcite and we also use this method to estimate the importance of the effect . as we will show later , this procedure generates a repulsive interaction between the nucleons and increases their chemical potentials in nuclear matter .    in this paper , we study the phase transition from nuclear matter to quark matter . the effect of nucleon finite size is considered in nuclear matter and color superconductivity is discussed in quark matter . since this is the first time we study the volume effect on the phase transition in our model , we restrict our investigation to just two flavors , without including strange quarks or hyperons .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . section ii sets out the formalism of the njl model which is applied to describe quark matter . in section iii",
    "we introduce the @xmath7 quark mean field model which is used to describe nuclear matter ",

    "the three solid curves are for nuclear matter and the two dashed lines for quark matter .",
    "if the nucleons are treated as point particles , there is no phase transition between nuclear matter and quark matter in this model .",
    "the chemical potentials for the nucleons are always smaller than the corresponding sums of quark potentials .",
    "when the volume effects are included , the nucleon chemical potentials will be increased and there is a first order phase transition between color superconducting quark matter and nuclear matter .",

    "the phase transition from nuclear matter to color superconducting quark matter will take place when the nucleon chemical potential , @xmath169 , is about 1.5 - 1.7 gev .    figs .  9 and 10 show the @xmath170 phase diagram for @xmath166 = 0.6 fm and 0.75 fm , respectively .",
    "since the phase transition is of first order , the densities of nuclear matter and quark matter are different .",
    "there is a coexistence state , m , in the figures .",
    "for the case of @xmath166 = 0.6 fm , at zero temperature , when the nuclear density is about 0.76 @xmath171 , quark matter starts to appear with density around 1.17 @xmath171 . for the case",
    "@xmath166 = 0.75 fm , the corresponding densities of nuclear matter and quark matter are 0.44 @xmath171 and 0.85 @xmath171 . from our calculation , we conclude that at low temperature , when the nuclear density is of order @xmath172 - @xmath173 , where @xmath0 is the saturation density of symmetric nuclear matter , there will be a phase transition .",
    "since the phase transition between color superconducting quark matter and normal quark matter is of second order , the density remains the same during the phase transition .    in our calculation",
    ", most parameters are fixed by well known physical quantities .",
    "besides the nucleon radius @xmath166 , there is only one parameter , the bag constant , which will sensitively affect the transition density and temperature .",
    "we discuss how the bag constant affects the transition temperature at zero baryon density . from the fig .",
    "11 , one can see that with increasing temperature , the pressure of nuclear matter at zero baryon density increases very slowly . until the temperature is around 180 mev",
    ", the pressure remains low .",
    "however , for quark matter , the pressure increases very fast when the temperature is larger than about 90 mev .",
    "this is because the quark mass is much smaller than the nucleon mass .",
    "if the bag constant lies in the range @xmath174 mev , the transition temperature at zero baryon density is in the range @xmath175 mev .",
    "in other words , if the transition temperature is about 150 mev the bag constant will be around @xmath176 mev@xmath160 which means that our choice of bag constant is reasonable .",
    "we have investigated the phase transition from nuclear matter to quark matter .",
    "the @xmath7 quark mean field model , including nucleon volume effects , has been applied to get the eos of nuclear matter .",
    "color superconducting quark matter has also been studied , using the njl model .",
    "the parameters in the models are determined by well known physical quantities .",
    "we now summarize the main results .",
    "the phase transition between nuclear matter and quark matter is of first order .",
    "there is no critical temperature above which the phase transition is of second order .",
    "the so called second order phase transition is a transition from chiral symmetry breaking quark matter to chiral symmetry restored quark matter .",
    "however , in the real world , at low density or temperature , there is no chiral symmetry breaking quark matter , but rather one has nuclear matter .",
    "therefore , the phase transition from nuclear matter to quark matter is always a first order transition , since the eos of nuclear and quark matter are different .",
    "the effects of the finite volume of the nucleon are very important , especially at high density .",
    "the volume effects generate a strong repulsive interaction between the nucleons and increase their chemical potentials .",
    "the transition density is sensitive to the nucleon radius . in our numerical calculations , we chose @xmath166 = 0.6 fm and 0.75 fm . at low temperature ,",
    "when the nuclear density is of order 2.5@xmath0 - 5@xmath0 , the color superconducting quark phase will appear with a density 0.4 @xmath171 larger than that of nuclear matter .",
    "besides the nucleon radius , the phase transition is also sensitive to the bag constant @xmath15 . if the bag constant is in the range 180 mev @xmath177 mev , the transition temperature will be 130 mev @xmath178 170 mev .",
    "the bag constant @xmath15 can be explained as the energy difference , @xmath138 , between two kinds of vacua . in the @xmath7 quark mean field model ,",
    "the calculated @xmath138 is reasonable , giving a transition temperature around 150 mev .    at low temperature ,",
    "when the density increases , the nuclear matter will always turn into color superconducting quark matter .",
    "when the temperature is larger than about 52 mev , the superconductivity phase disappears .",
    "the transition from normal quark matter to color superconducting quark matter is of second order , while the transition from nuclear matter to quark matter is of first order .    in conclusion",
    ", we note that our discussions concerning the order of the phase transitions investigated here have been based upon mean field theory . in fact , for the transition from superconducting quark matter to normal quark matter , with the gluon field fluctuation , this transition must be of the first order .",
    "it clearly will be important to explore such effects in the current model .",
    "in addition , we have presented results without any consideration of strangeness .",
    "as strange quarks may be expected to appear at perhaps 2.5 to 3 times normal nuclear matter density ( for matter in beta equilibrium , as in a neutron star ) , it will also be of interest to extend the present model to include strange quarks .",
