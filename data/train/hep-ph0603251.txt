    "<S> they evolve from the cutoff scale to a low energy via the renormalization running , and are recognized through signals of the flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath6 mixings of the right - handed squarks have attracted a lot of interests  @xcite in the light of the discovery of the neutrino oscillations with large mixing angles  @xcite , and the success of the supersymmetric grand unification . </S>",
    "<S> the mixings are parameterized by the flavor - changing components between @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the mass matrices , which are called the @xmath9 and @xmath10 mixings , respectively . at the weak scale </S>",
    "<S> , they contribute to @xmath11 transition processes . </S>",
    "<S> some golden modes have been already measured precisely in experiments , and their results are compared to the sm predictions . particularly , the measured branching ratio of the inclusive @xmath12 decay is known to agree well with the sm value  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus it provides one of the severest constraints on the down - type squark mixings , including the @xmath9 and @xmath10 mixings . </S>",
    "<S> even with the constraint from @xmath13 , there is still left large possibility to detect sizable effects on some @xmath11 processes , especially , from the right - handed squark mixings .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , the d collaboration have reported the updated result of the mass difference of the @xmath14 mesons  @xcite : @xmath15 which is the first result with a direct two - side bound . </S>",
    "<S> although the data includes large uncertainties , this result is in agreement with the sm predictions , which are estimated as @xmath16 ps@xmath17 by the utfit group  @xcite and @xmath18 ps@xmath17 by the ckmfitter group  @xcite . in the supersymmetric sm </S>",
    "<S> , it is known that a combination of the @xmath19 and @xmath9 mixings , @xmath20 , can enhance the susy contributions to @xmath0 sizably  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if the @xmath19 mixing is suppressed sufficiently , the current data of @xmath0 remains insensitive to the right - handed mixings  @xcite .    among the squark mixings , the @xmath19 mixing at the weak scale generally receives a correction of at least @xmath21 </S>",
    "<S> this is because the susy breaking effects are usually mediated to the visible sector at the high energy scale . actually in general supersymmetric sm at the weak scale </S>",
    "<S> , we might choose the down - type @xmath19 squark mixing to vanish . </S>",
    "<S> however , in realistic models , the mixing will be induced because the ckm matrix affects the left - handed mass matrix of the down - type squarks during the renormalization group evolutions . in a class of supergravity mediations </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath19 mixing generally gets a correction of @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the wolfenstein parameter . in this letter , we want to emphasize that this tiny mixing is significant for @xmath0 when we discuss the mixings in the right - handed sector . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that even without any imprinted @xmath19 mixing , the @xmath9 squark mixing can affect @xmath0 to the level of the sm value satisfying with the bound from @xmath24 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us first review the susy contributions to @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 transition is represented by the transition matrix element , @xmath25 in terms of @xmath26 , which corresponds to the susy contributions , the mass difference between @xmath14 and @xmath27 becomes @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> although the estimation of the sm value contains large hadronic uncertainties , the ratio @xmath29 can be predicted more cleanly . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath26 is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 are masses of the mesons , @xmath32 gev and @xmath33 gev , and @xmath34 is defined by ratios of the decay constants and of the bag parameters  @xcite . in above expression </S>",
    "<S> , we assume @xmath35 because the susy contributions to @xmath36 transitions is tightly limited by the experimental results  @xcite   may include susy contributions at @xmath37  @xcite , the following discussions remain valid </S>",
    "<S> . similarly , even when we use @xmath0 itself instead of @xmath29 , the results are almost same . ] . from the experimental result in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : deltams_exp ] ) and @xmath38 ps@xmath17 @xcite , the susy contributions are favored to be in the region , @xmath39 with including a @xmath40 % uncertainty from the sm estimations , which is mainly due to the ratio of the ckm matrix elements @xmath41  @xcite .    the sm contribution , @xmath42 , is obtained by exchanging the @xmath43 boson and top quark . on the other hand , the susy contribution @xmath44 is by exchanging the gluino and down - type squarks . in the following analysis , we evaluate the susy contributions by the full expressions , namely , without the mass - insertion approximation  @xcite ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the explicit forms which are relevant for the right - handed mixings ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , it is known that the chargino contributions are much suppressed compared to the gluino ones  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus we neglect them in the following .    </S>",
    "<S> the flavor violations are caused by the intermediating squarks in the diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> the mass matrix of the down - type squarks contains the flavor - changing components with / without chirality flipping , and the terms relevant for the @xmath11 transitions are @xmath45 at the mixing between @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and @xmath48 between @xmath46 and @xmath49 , where @xmath50 correspond to the chirality of the squarks , and the numbers outside the parenthesis means the mixing components between the second and third generations . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 transition is then induced by pairs of the mixings : the @xmath51 and @xmath52 mixings , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to mention that the ratio @xmath26 is enhanced especially by a pair of the @xmath19 and @xmath9 mixings , @xmath53  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath19 squark mixing receives the radiative corrections via the ckm matrix during the renormalization group evolution . the running from the cutoff scale @xmath54 to the weak scale @xmath55 gives a mixing such as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the top yukawa coupling , @xmath58 are typical values of diagonal components of the scalar and squark mass matrices , and @xmath59 is a trilinear coupling , @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that the mixing arises even when the mass matrix is diagonal at the cutoff scale . </S>",
    "<S> actually , in supergravity mediations with @xmath54 at the planck scale or the gut scale @xmath61 gev , the renormalization group evolution induces @xmath62 . with this @xmath19 mixing , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath9 squark mixing can contribute effectively to the ratio @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> it should be stressed that the @xmath19 mixing of @xmath21 is rather general independent of the details of the squark mass matrices at the cutoff scale , and it is hard to suppress the @xmath19 mixing at the weak scale unless the mixing is tuned at the cutoff scale . in the following analysis , we will use @xmath62 as a representative value   mixing of @xmath63 is imprinted at the cutoff scale , @xmath44 will be enhanced too much due to the interference with the @xmath9 mixing . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis , however , depends on the structure of the mass matrices especially of the left - handed sector . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the @xmath19 mixing of @xmath21 at the weak scale is independent of the details of the models , and the following constraint on the right - handed squark mixing is rather generic . ] .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the bound of the squark mixings from @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the susy contributions to this mode are induced through the gluino , chargino and charged - higgs loops  , which is sensitive to the sign of @xmath64 , and has been already limited by the experiment  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the bound is always satisfied here because the @xmath19 mixing is small enough , @xmath65  @xcite . ] . </S>",
    "<S> they significantly depend on @xmath66 and a sign of the higgsino mass parameter , @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the susy contributions are enhanced by large @xmath66 , and sign@xmath68 determines signs of the chargino and gluino contributions compared to the sm and charged - higgs ones . as well as the evaluations of @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , we evaluate the susy contributions including the gluino ones by the full expressions  @xcite   and @xmath69 , when we study the @xmath19 and/or @xmath9 squark mixings . </S>",
    "<S> rather the dominant contributions are provided by so - called the double mass - insertion diagrams even for small @xmath66 , like @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the explicit forms of the double - mass insertions . ] . in the following analysis , </S>",
    "<S> we take the bound , @xmath71 which is rather conservative after taking into account both the experimental and theoretical uncertainties .    </S>",
    "<S> we calculated the susy contributions to @xmath0 as well as @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : deltams_rr ] , we displayed the regions which is favored by the current result of @xmath0 , and that is excluded by @xmath13 for a range of the real and imaginary parts of the @xmath9 mixing , @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is a typical mass of the squarks . </S>",
    "<S> here we assume all relevant soft parameters including @xmath67 are @xmath75 gev , and @xmath76 . in order to clarify the effects of the renormalization group evolutions </S>",
    "<S> , we show the result of @xmath77 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : deltams_rr](a ) , and that of @xmath65 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : deltams_rr](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we find that the radiative corrections in the @xmath19 mixing can enhance the susy contributions for @xmath0 extremely to the extent of the magnitude which is implied by the current data ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : deltams_rr](b ) ) , compared to the result without the effects ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : deltams_rr](a ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we also considered other two sets of the mass spectrum of the gluino and squarks . </S>",
    "<S> the first pattern is @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> this type is interesting for the fcncs whose amplitude is dominated by the wilson coefficient of the gluon - dipole operator , @xmath79 . since the relevant contribution to @xmath13 comes from the photo - dipole operator , @xmath80 , the mass pattern is favored to enhance the susy contributions for such fcncs with satisfying the bound from @xmath81 , namely , enhance @xmath69 compared to @xmath64  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we estimated numerically @xmath0 and @xmath13 in this case : @xmath82 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : deltams_hsq ] , the parameters are set as the same as fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : deltams_rr](b ) , but the gluino and squark masses are @xmath83 gev and @xmath84 tev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we find that although both the contributions are suppressed by the heavy squarks , the @xmath0 region remains inside that excluded by @xmath13 .    </S>",
    "<S> the second mass spectrum is @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> such a pattern can suppress the susy contributions to the electric dipole moments ( edms ) . </S>",
    "<S> it has been pointed out that the strong bounds are imposed on the cp - violating @xmath86 mixings from the hadronic edms  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> especially it is very strong for the right - handed sector even when we allow large hadronic uncertainties . in the above discussions </S>",
    "<S> , we implicitly assumed accidental cancellations among the additional susy contributions for the edms . </S>",
    "<S> another way out of the edms is to suppress them by large squark masses . </S>",
    "<S> when the left - handed squarks decouple , the edm bound can be relaxed to the negligible level . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical result is in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : deltams_hl ] , where the parameters are the same as fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : deltams_rr](b ) but @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> we find the favored regions by @xmath0 in the graph , though all the constraints are satisfied because the susy contributions to @xmath13 as well as the edms can be neglected by large @xmath88 .    </S>",
    "<S> even when we take other sets of parameters , the results remain similar . </S>",
    "<S> let us first flip the sign of @xmath67 parameter . </S>",
    "<S> then the cancellation becomes worse among the susy contributions to @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , @xmath0 is insensitive to the sign@xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> then the favored region from @xmath0 starts to be restricted by @xmath13 . instead </S>",
    "<S> , when we take @xmath89 , the remaining contributions after the cancellation become enhanced for @xmath13 , while @xmath0 is insensitive to @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> we checked that the favored regions by the observables become narrower for the @xmath9 mixing in both cases </S>",
    "<S> .    there might be a large mixing in the @xmath10 component at the cutoff scale . </S>",
    "<S> as already known , the flavor mixings with chirality flipping can not induce large @xmath0 at the weak scale  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the mixings are constrained by @xmath13 to the extent of the negligible level for @xmath0 . on the contrary , the @xmath10 mixing at the high energy scale can contribute sizably to the @xmath9 mixing at the weak scale through the renormalization group running  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus the similar arguments may be applicable for the @xmath10 mixing at the cutoff scale as those of the @xmath9 case , though the detailed discussion depends on the parameters . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we conclude that the susy contributions to @xmath0 is sensitive to the right - handed squark mixings at the cutoff scale in the light of the current result of @xmath0 by considering the radiative correction for the @xmath19 squark mixing .    </S>",
    "<S> let us comment on implications to other @xmath11 transition processes . </S>",
    "<S> the mixing - induced cp asymmetry of @xmath90 decays has been measured by babar and belle  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the results still contain large theoretical / experimental uncertainties , we obtain an important implication from the measurements that all the values tend to shift to the same side from the sm values , which is determined by @xmath91 modes . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is observed independently of the parity of the final states . </S>",
    "<S> if the displacements are due to susy effects , the results naturally imply additional cp - violating mixings in the left - handed squark sector  @xcite . on the contrary , in order to realize the same feature by the right - handed squark mixings , rather large susy contributions are required  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we checked that such mixings induce too large @xmath0 to stay within the current data as long as we consider the renormalization group effects . </S>",
    "<S> this means that although the susy @xmath92 gut + @xmath93 model is one of the best candidates which naturally induce large susy contributions to @xmath90 decays  @xcite , the model is disfavored in order to explain the current experimental result of @xmath0 as well as those modes . </S>",
    "<S> other interesting @xmath11 observables are mixing - induced cp asymmetry of the @xmath94 decay and @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> since they are sensitive to the right - handed squark mixings , we can still expect to detect signals of new physics at lhc / super @xmath96-factory . </S>",
    "<S> we thus stress that measurements of @xmath0 have impacts on the squark - flavor mixings .    </S>",
    "<S> _ note added _ : shortly after this letter , the cdf collaboration reported the new result of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental error was reduced very well , and the result is found to be consistent with the d value , thus the sm estimation . even taking into account the cdf result , </S>",
    "<S> the analysis in this letter does not change because the uncertainties in the analysis dominantly come from the sm estimation . </S>",
    "<S> although the uncertainty may be reduced by combining the other measurements of the flavor changing processes , such an analysis is beyond the scope of this letter and should be studied elsewhere . </S>"
