    "rna molecules are very diverse both structurally and functionally  @xcite .",
    "apart from having the regular helical purine - pyramidene base pairs , rna molecules are also found to have many other secondary structures ( motifs ) such as loops , knots and bulges etc  @xcite .",
    "the presence of such structural motifs is found to play a role in binding of different molecules to rna  @xcite . for many protein binding rnas",
    ", it was found that the frequency of adenosine bulge at the binding site is very high .",
    "the presence of a bulge may change the conformational flexibility of an rna  @xcite and hence more internal surface area of rna is available for any chemistry .",
    "moreover , the presence of the bulges does not only change the conformational flexibility but the bulges themselves may just flip out exposing the internal regions of a rna to solvent and ligands .",
    "it has been shown that the bulge base looping out is highly sensitive to the bulge bases and their neighbors  @xcite , which makes the question of generality of any picture of base bulge looping out difficult .",
    "recent state of the art computer simulations of small rnas have shed light on the base bulge looping out processes  @xcite in few of the possible cases .",
    "specifically , these works have studied the free energy barriers associated with bulge base looping out process  @xcite . for example a. barthel and m. zacharias studied single uridine and adenosine bulge structures and their looping out using the torsional angle which measures the degree of looping out of bulge bases from the local helical plane .",
    "they find that the conformational free energy change in the case of adenosine bulge in a complete looping out process is higher by @xmath3  kcal.mol@xmath4 as compared to the adenosine bulge  @xcite , suggesting that in a base nonspecific binding process a structure with single uracil bulge base would have higher propensity to flip out of helical plane .",
    "although , a wealth of literature is available on the base looping from the helical plane at ambient conditions ; the changes in the kinetics of bulge base flipping is rather unexplored at conditions away from ambient conditions .",
    "it is known that water s hydrogen bond network and so the local structure of liquid water changes upon changing thermodynamic conditions , giving rise to anomalous changes in the dynamics and thermodynamics of water and aqueous systems . the structural stability and kinetics of proteins ( where structural stability usually implies kinetically functional ) as a function of pressure and temperature .",
    "the solvation barrier in the case of proteins plays an important role both in the hydrophobic collapse of the polypeptides as well as the stability of these structures as a function of pressure and temperature . in this paper",
    ", we will investigate another class of molecules which are involved in ligand binding kientics and are very stable at high pressures and temperatures .",
    "one can ask questions whether the structural stability in these cases will also imply kinetic functionality .",
    "we specifically study the binding of a purine a based molecules to small rnas with a single a - bulge structural motif .",
    "this study is relevant to understand the self - aminoacylation of small ribozymes  @xcite in different thermodynamic conditions .",
    "it is widely believed that for the purine a - based molecules such as atp to bind to such a bulge , the a - bulge base has to flip out , which allows the purine a - based molecules to come and stack into the bulge configuration . in other words , for the binding to proceed the a - bulge has to overcome both the bending regidity and solvation energy barrier to solvate in water .",
    "the solvation of different substances in water is a widely studied problem  @xcite .",
    "indeed , studies of apolar solutes in water shows an ellipitic region in the pressure - temperature plane in which water behaves as a bad solvent and hence less solubility of these subtances  @xcite .",
    "however , study of solvation barrier of base flipping in case of rna / dna is not studied .    in this paper",
    ", we study the effect of pressure on the kinetics of bulge base looping out of a double strand rna with single adenosine bulge . in section",
    "ii , we discuss the method , in section iii we present the results for the free energy barrier associated with torsional deviation of the bulge base from the local helical backbone , in section iv we present a mean first passage time calculation associated with looping out process and finally we discuss and summarize the results .",

    "the long range electrostatic interactions were treated with the particle - mesh - ewald ( pme ) method .",

    "furthermore , we note that although the free energy barrier associated with complete looped out conformations is finite is for all the pressures the final looped out state is not a free energy minimum state hence a rna structure with single a bulge would not favor ligand binding . to verify this we ran @xmath42  ns long simulations to see if there is any bulge looping out event at different pressures and we do not observe any .     for different pressures",

    "as we have seen the sections above , that the base flipping kinetics changes as the pressure is increased  namely , the free energy barrier for the bulge base to flip out increases with pressure . moreover , the transient barrier which presumably is due to the base triplet formation of the bulge base with the neighboring bases disappears at pressures @xmath72  kbar .",
