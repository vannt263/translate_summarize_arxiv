    "future wireless cellular networks ( e.g. imt - advanced ) are expected to provide higher data rates and system capacity .",
    "one potential technology to meet the demands is the infrastructure - assisted device - to - device ( d2d ) communications @xcite .",
    "taking advantage of the physical proximity of communication devices , the d2d technique enables direct communications between devices , which results in high data rates , low delays and low power consumption . unlike conventional ad hoc networks ,",
    "the cellular base station ( bs ) plays an important role for d2d communications in helping the d2d nodes on both peer discovery and resource allocation @xcite .",
    "there are several existing works on d2d communications in cellular networks . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the d2d nodes share the spectrum with cellular users using an underlay approach , in which the throughput of d2d communications is maximized while the qos of the cellular users is guaranteed . in @xcite and @xcite , the maximum sum - rate of the network",
    "is achieved by dynamically selecting one of the transmission modes , including d2d mode with shared channels , d2d mode with dedicated channels and cellular transmission mode . in @xcite ,",
    "the multi - antenna cellular bs acts as a cooperative relay , helping the d2d nodes forward packets so as to improve the throughput of the network .",
    "power control is important for interference coordination among the nodes in wireless networks .",
    "the transmit power is adjusted to meet the users required signal to interference plus noise ratios ( sinr )  @xcite , satisfy the received signal power level  @xcite or achieve a higher data rate  @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", the transmit power is minimized for d2d communications subject to a sum - rate constraint .",
    "however , these existing works have all focused on the physical layer performance without consideration of the bursty data arrivals at the transmitters as well as the delay requirement of the information flows . since real - life applications ( such as video streaming , web browsing or voip ) are delay - sensitive , it is important to optimize the delay performance for d2d communications .    to take the queueing delay into consideration , the radio resource control policy should be a function of both the channel state information ( csi ) and the queue state information ( qsi ) .",
    "this is because the csi reveals the instantaneous transmission opportunities at the physical layer and the qsi reveals the urgency of the data flows .",
    "however , the associated optimization problem is very challenging . a systematic approach to",
    "the delay - aware optimization problem is through the markov decision process ( mdp ) . in general , the optimal control policy can be obtained by solving the well - known _",
    "bellman equation_. conventional solutions to the bellman equation , such as brute - force value iteration or policy iteration @xcite , have huge complexity ( i.e. , the curse of dimensionality ) , because solving the bellman equation involves solving an exponentially large system of non - linear equations",
    ". there are some existing works that use the _ stochastic approximation _ approach with distributed online learning algorithm @xcite , which has linear complexity",
    ". however , the stochastic learning approach can only give a numerical solution to the bellman equation and may suffer from slow convergence and lack of insight .",
    "we treat this issue and provide some preliminary results on cross - layer design with closed - form solution in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the dynamic power control for d2d communications systems .",
    "we focus on minimizing the average transmit power and the average delay of the d2d data flows .",
    "there are several technical challenges associated with the dynamic power control optimization problem .",
    "* * challenges due to the average delay consideration : * unlike other papers which optimize the physical layer throughput of the d2d systems , the optimization involving delay constraints is fundamentally challenging .",
    "this is because the associated problem belongs to the class of _ stochastic optimization _",
    "@xcite , which embraces both _ information theory _",
    "( to model the physical layer dynamics ) and _ queueing theory _ ( to model the queue dynamics ) . a key obstacle to solving the associated bellman equation is to obtain the priority function , and there is no easy and systematic solution in general @xcite . * * challenges due to the coupled queue dynamics : * the interference among the d2d nodes @xcite fundamentally induces coupled queue dynamics among the d2d flows . for instance , the service rate of the queue for each d2d flow depends on the transmit power of all the other active d2d flows due to the mutual interference .",
    "the associated stochastic optimization problem is a @xmath0-dimensional mdp , where @xmath0 is the number of d2d flows .",
    "this @xmath0-dimensional mdp leads to the curse of dimensionality with complexity exponential to @xmath0 for solving the associated bellman equation .",
    "it is highly nontrivial to obtain a low complexity solution for the dynamic resource control of the d2d systems . *",
    "* challenges due to the non - convexity nature : * despite the complexity issue involved in obtaining the priority function for the stochastic optimization problem , the per - stage control optimization in the bellman equation is also non - convex due to the mutual interference term in the mutual information .",
    "this poses a great challenge in solving the delay - constrained optimization in the d2d systems .        in this paper",
    ", we first establish the phy , mac and bursty data source models as well as the queue dynamics in section ii .",
    "we formally formulate the associated stochastic optimization problem of the dynamic power control for delay - aware d2d communications as _ an infinite horizon average cost mdp_. to overcome the aforementioned technical challenges , we exploit specific problem structures in d2d communications . specifically , 1 ) the csma - like mac protocol is adopted to coordinate the transmissions of the d2d nodes in a distributive way and",
    "this induces a _ weak interference _",
    "topology among the simultaneously transmitting d2d nodes , and 2 ) the assistance of the bs substantially simplifies the signaling mechanism of control information exchange .",
    "we derive a _",
    "simplified optimality condition _ for solving the mdp in section iii . compared with the conventional _ bellman equation _ @xcite , the derived optimality condition involves solving a @xmath0-dimensional partial differential equation ( pde ) only . utilizing the _ interference filtering property _ of the mac protocol",
    ", we obtain a closed - form approximate priority function and the associated error bound using _",
    "perturbation analysis_. based on that , we obtain a delay - aware low complexity dynamic power control algorithm for the d2d communications in section iv . the solution is shown to be asymptotically optimal for a sufficiently large carrier sensing distance in the mac protocol . furthermore , in section v , we show that the proposed solution achieves significant performance gain over various baseline schemes .",
    "in this section , we introduce the system model for the infrastructure - assisted d2d communications , including the d2d system topology , the physical layer model , the mac layer model and the bursty data source model .",

    "the numerical results show that the approximation error is small and will vanish if the cross - channel path gain goes to 0 . based on the closed - form approximation",
    ", we propose a low complexity iterative power control algorithm and discuss some implementation issues for practical systems .",
    "finally , simulation results show that the proposed power control algorithm has significant performance gains in delay performance compared with various state - of - the - art baselines .",
