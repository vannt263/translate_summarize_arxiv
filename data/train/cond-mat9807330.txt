    "in recent years the electrical conduction in transition metal perovskite oxides at low temperature has attracted considerable research interest@xcite .",
    "most of these oxides studied belong to the abo@xmath7 class or its closely linked derivatives . in recent years the observation of colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) in rare - earth maganates belonging to the abo@xmath7 class has added yet another new phenomena @xcite .",
    "these oxides have chemical formula of the type",
    "la@xmath8(sr / ca)@xmath9mno@xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "the colossal * negative * mr seen in these oxides have become a topic of intense research activity . in these mixed valent manganates ( doped to create mn@xmath12 ) the cmr",
    "is closely linked to the occurence of strong ferromagnetism which arises from the double exchange ( de ) interactions .",
    "the additional important contribution to the cmr phenomenon comes from the strong jahn - teller effect of the mn@xmath13 ions . in a closely related compound la@xmath8sr@xmath9coo@xmath10 ( with co@xmath13 and co@xmath12 ) which is also a ferromagnetic metallic oxide for @xmath14 the mr was found to be much smaller except in the composition range @xmath15 @xmath6 0.2 where the oxide undergoes a composition driven metal - insulator transition @xcite .",
    "the negative mr in this material for @xmath15 @xmath6 0.2 is believed to be related to the formation of ferromagnetic clusters . in both these oxides",
    "the electron is on the verge of getting localized .",
    "on the other hand there are metallic oxides also belonging to abo@xmath7 class like sr@xmath9nbo@xmath10 ( x@xmath16 0.75 ) @xcite and na@xmath17wo@xmath10 @xcite with relatively high conductivity which have positive mr at all temperatures . in these oxides",
    "the mr has a quadratic dependence on the applied field @xmath18 much like a band metal .",
    "the principal differences between the two classes of perovskite oxides seems to be the extent of electron localization and the presence of ferromagnetic interactions .",
    "this leads us to the following interesting question : _ if we start with a metallic perovskite oxide showing positive mr and gradually make the electrons localized ( by some means ) , will the positive mr change to a negative mr as the electrons get localized ? _ we investigate this question in the metallic perovskite lanio@xmath0 in which we find that the mr changes from positive to negative as the material is made more resistive by increasing @xmath1 .",
    "lanio@xmath7 belonging to the abo@xmath7 class is structurally similar to lacoo@xmath7 and lamno@xmath7 .",
    "however unlike the cobaltate and the manganate , it is a fairly good metal with low resistivity @xcite .",
    "however , as the oxygen deficiency is increased the resistivity is enhanced .",
    "eventually the material becomes an insulator at @xmath1 > 0.25 @xcite .",
    "the investigation of the mr in this oxide is thus of importance because it allows us to investigate the mr in a class of disordered oxides where a change in oxygen stoichiometry leads to a qualitative change in the nature of electronic transport without bringing in strong magnetic effects atleast for @xmath2 0.2 .",
    "lanio@xmath7 is an interesting material because of its potential in application as metallic interconnects ( or electrodes ) in thin film oxide electronics particularly those needing epitaxial multilayer perovskite oxide films @xcite .",
    "the mr data of this oxide will thus be of importance technologically .",
    "the samples of lanio@xmath0 were prepared from co - precipitation and subsequent decomposition of nitrates of la and ni as described in refs .  [ 8 ] and [ 12 ] .",
    "the samples were heat treated under different oxygen atmosphere to get varying oxygen content and the oxygen stoichiometry @xmath1 was determined by iodometric titration .",
    "the grain sizes as measured by scanning electron microscope were typically of the order of 2 @xmath19 m and there was no variation in the grain sizes of the samples with different @xmath1 .",
    "[ see ref [ 13 ] for details of sample preparation and charactrisation ] .",
    "the electrical resistivity @xmath20(t ) and the mr were measured by a high precision low frequency ( 20 hz ) ac bridge technique with a precision of @xmath2110ppm .",
    "the resistivity was measured in the range 0.4k -300k and the mr was measured in the range 1.5k- 30k in a field of up to 6 tesla .",
    "in figure  1 we present the resistivity measurements for the three samples with the general formula lanio@xmath0 . we identify the samples in decreasing order of @xmath1 and",
    "have called them a , b and c for @xmath1 = 0.14 , 0.08 and 0.02 respectively .",
    "for all the samples the @xmath20(t ) curve show a metallic behaviour although the residual resistivity @xmath22 increases by a factor of 30 as @xmath1 changes from 0.02 to 0.14 .",
    "we restrict our investigations to @xmath23 0.14 to avoid any complications arising from magnetic clusters which appear for @xmath24 0.2 @xcite .    for the sample with @xmath1=0.14 which has the highest @xmath25 the mean free path ( @xmath26 ) , estimated from the simple free electron approximation , is somewhat smaller than the ni - o bond length ( @xmath6 2 ) .",
    "interestingly , it can be seen that for this sample there is a resistivity minima around 20k .",
    "this is very similar to the behavior of highly disordered metallic alloys .",
    "the exact temperature dependence of @xmath20(t ) in lanio@xmath0 with varying @xmath1 has been critically looked into @xcite .",
    "we do not discuss these in detail here .",
    "we just mention that in the samples b and c which show no resistivity minima we have a power law dependence of the resistivity with t given as @xcite :      where @xmath28(t ) is the function giving a linear temperature dependence at high temperature ( t  >  200k ) and a t@xmath29 ( n@xmath16 2 ) dependence for low temperatures .",
    "@xmath25 is the residual resistivity and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are constants . for the sample",
    "a , which shows the highest resistivity , we have a resistivity minima at t@xmath32  =  20k and @xmath20(t ) for t  <  t@xmath32 shows a shallow rise ( see figure  1 ) . we find that this shallow rise of @xmath20 below t@xmath32 can be best accounted for by using expressions for weak localization ( wl ) .",
    "we also find below that the mr measurements supports this view .",
    "we quantify the weak localization @xcite contribution by an additional term -@xmath33t@xmath34 which is incorporated into eqn.[eq : fullt ] .",
    "thus , we fit the resistivity of sample a using the expression        in figure  2 we show the mr of the three samples as a function of the applied field h at t = 4.2k . we define the mr as @xmath36/@xmath37 = ( @xmath20(h ) - @xmath20(0))/@xmath37 , where @xmath37 for the zero field resistivity at a given temperature t. the magnetoresistance of the lanio@xmath0 system is small but has a distinct dependence on the oxygen stoichiometry .",
    "it is positive for the least resistive sample c , it is negative for sample a which has the highest resistivity and it is almost zero ( < 0.05% ) for sample b with intermediate resistivity .",
    "the mr thus becomes progressively negative as the resistivity increases .",
    "the field dependence of mr also changes as @xmath1 increases . for sample c",
    ", mr has a quadratic dependence on h which is shown in figure  3 .",
    "the mr seems to follow khler rule @xcite .",
    "the mr for this sample is positive at all t. according to koehler rule the dependence of mr on temperature , magnetic field and purity of the sample should be a function of h@xmath38 only , where @xmath38 is the relaxation time . since @xmath39 , @xmath40 @xmath41(h/@xmath37 ) , where @xmath41(h/@xmath37 ) is a function of h/@xmath37 . for normal metals",
    "the mr shows a quadratic dependence with field due to the band mr .",
    "hence we can write :      where , @xmath43 is a constant for the material .",
    "fitting the mr of sample c with the above expression we get @xmath43 = 3.98@xmath4410@xmath45 ( @xmath46cm / t)@xmath47 . for normal metals the value of @xmath48 10@xmath49 ( @xmath46cm / t)@xmath47 .",
    "this difference is very interesting because if the positive mr indeed arises from a band mechanism then it is one of the largest mr arising from the band mechanism .",
    "it will be of interest to compare the mr of this oxide with other oxides showing positive mr @xcite .",
    "the other known metallic oxides showing positive mr , sr@xmath9nbo@xmath7 ( x @xmath50 0.8 ) @xcite and na@xmath17wo@xmath7 @xcite shows a h@xmath47 dependence over a small field range ( h @xmath50 3 tesla ) .",
    "the values of @xmath43 for sr@xmath51nbo@xmath7 ( @xmath52 = 1.75m@xmath46 cm ) and na@xmath17wo@xmath7 ( @xmath52 = 3@xmath53 cm ) are 1.127@xmath4410@xmath54 ( @xmath46cm / t)@xmath47 and 4x10@xmath49 ( @xmath46cm / t)@xmath47 respectively .",
    "it seems therefore in these oxides the constant @xmath43 increases as @xmath20 increases .",
    "this observation needs more investigation to establish whether this indeed is a general feature of metallic oxides .    for sample",
    "a the mr is not only negative , the field dependence is also qualitatively different",
    ". we will show below that it is possible to explain the field dependence of the negative mr as arising from destruction of weak localisation on application of magnetic field . for sample b , the mr",
    "being almost zero we did nt attempt any fit .",
    "most likely for this sample we have almost equal contribution from both the positive and negative terms .",
    "the temperature dependence of the mr also carries a distinct mark of the oxygen stoichiometry . as shown in figure  4 , the mr of sample a is negative for t < t@xmath32 and positive for t > t@xmath32 , where t@xmath32 is the temperature of resistivity minima ( see figure  1 )",
    "it has been discussed before that the resistivity minima can arise due to the contribution by wl for t < t@xmath32 . for t",
    "the mr is positive as in sample c. for t",
    "< t@xmath32 the wl is supressed by the application of the magnetic field and hence there will be a negative contribution to the mr .",
    "to look at this quantitatively we have fitted the magnetoconductance curves to the wl expression @xcite with an additional h@xmath47 term to account for the khler type negative magnetoconductance ( or positive mr ) . in the following we used conductivity change ( @xmath55 ) instead of resistivity change ( @xmath56 ) to follow the customary procedure for wl expressions .",
    "the expression thus used was @xcite :        here , @xmath59 is the electron diffusivity , @xmath60 is the electron phase relaxation time and @xmath61 is a constant . in this expression @xmath61 and @xmath62",
    "can be free parameters . however , to restrict the number of free parameters we fixed the parameter @xmath61 following khler s rule using the following strategy .",
    "the khler s rule ( see eqn [ eq : kho ] ) expressed in terms of the conductivity is given by @xmath63 = -@xmath61 h@xmath47 where @xmath61 = @xmath64 . assuming the validity of the khler s rule for the samples a and",
    "c would imply that both samples will have the same @xmath43 .",
    "thus , using @xmath43 as found from sample c in figure  3 we have estimated the value of @xmath61 for sample a. the values of @xmath61 for t @xmath50 4.2k are @xmath6 0.01 ( s / cm)/t@xmath47 . using these @xmath61 we fit the magnetoconductance data to eqn [ eq : mr ] using @xmath62 as the only fit parameter .",
    "a good fit can be obtained for the magnetoconductance data as shown in the inset of figure  4 .",
    "the @xmath62 values ( fit parameters ) for the two temperatures were obtained as 1.26x10@xmath45 cm@xmath47 for t=2.3k and 1.12x10@xmath45 cm@xmath47 for t=4.2k . using the above values of @xmath62",
    ", we have estimated the value of the wl correction to the zero field conductivity of the sample .",
    "we get @xmath66 ( @xmath67 to be about 12.3 s / cm which is about a factor of 2.5 more than that estimated from the resistivity data of this sample at low temperature ( @xmath6 4.8 s / cm ) . within the limits of experimental error",
    "we can say that this is a good agreement since , the estimate of @xmath66 from the resistivity involves some uncertainities because of the presence of other terms with much larger contributions ( see eqn .  2 ) .",
    "also we have only an approximate value for @xmath68 .",
    "we can thus conclude that the negative mr seen in this oxide can arise from the weak localization contribution . at t",
    "=  25  k the positive contribution wins over .",
    "but given the smallness of mr it is difficult to obtain any meaningful fit .",
    "one important effect that we should address is the formation of local magnetic moments and any ferromagnetic interaction arising from it which can give rise to negative mr .",
    "while stoichiometric lanio@xmath10 is a pauli paramagnet , creation of ni@xmath69 ions in oxygen deficient samples can lead to a curie - weiss type contribution .",
    "we have measured the susceptibility for sample a. the susceptibility and the analysis are reported in ref.[13 ] .",
    "we mention the important results , since they are relevant to this paper .",
    "for t<100k we could fit the susceptibility to @xmath70 = @xmath71 + c/(t-@xmath72 ) .",
    "a fit to the expression gives @xmath71 = 5.95x10@xmath73 emu / gm , @xmath72 = -51  k and c = 3.83x10@xmath74 emu   k / gm .",
    "the large value of c can arise from the ni@xmath69 formation as @xmath1 increases @xcite . for sample",
    "a , for which @xmath1 = 0.14 , about 30% of the ni in the system is in the ni@xmath69 state .",
    "however , not all of the ni@xmath69 carry moments because part of the ni@xmath69 which are in square planar cordination are diamagnetic .",
    "though there is a net small antiferromagnetic interaction ( @xmath75 -51  k ) , the susceptibility shows no sign of any magnetic ordering or cluster formation .",
    "it can be contrasted to the composition lanio@xmath76 which shows the transition to an insulating state and a clear signature of a spin - glass or cluster glass like transition near 150k @xcite . from these observations",
    "we conclude that the magnetic interactions will not play an important role for the mr of the samples ( @xmath2 0.14 ) which we have investigated",
    ". it may be that for @xmath24 0.2 the cluster formation can lead to mr dominated by magnetic interaction effects .    in summary",
    ", we have measured the magnetoresistance of the metallic perovskite oxide lanio@xmath0 as a function of the oxygen defect @xmath1 .",
    "the most metallic sample has a clear positive mr which progressively goes to the negative magnitude as the oxygen defect increases .",
    "the positive mr seems to arise from a band - like contribution as seen in normal metals but the magnitude is much larger than that seen in conventional metals .",
    "the negative mr seen in the oxygen deficient sample arises from weak - localisation contribution and is not due to any magnetic interactions .",
    "our experiment shows that the effects like weak - localisation of electrons can lead to small but finite negative mr in these oxides which may be masked by stronger negative mr arising from magnetic origin in other oxides .",
