    "this anisotropy is what leads to their useful optic properties .",
    "the molecular geometry and interactions can lead to a wide range of equilibrium phases . in this paper",
    "we are concerned with the nematic phase where the molecules tend to align along a preferred direction , referred to as the director , giving long - range orientational order .",
    "the propensity to order , as well as the direction along which the system orders are conveniently described by a tensor order parameter @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "an important feature of the nematic phase is the possibility of topological defects .",
    "these are director configurations that can not relax to the nematic ground state by a continuous rotation of the molecules .",
    "examples of such defects that we will consider are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_twodefects](b ) .",
    "in addition , although widely recognized as an important factor in device performance , the flow of the liquid crystal in response to changes in the orientation of the molecules is both difficult to measure experimentally and to incorporate into a simulation of the device .",
    "liquid crystal hydrodynamics are typically described by the ericksen - leslie - parodi equations of motion @xcite .",
    "however these are restricted to an order parameter field of constant magnitude and do not include the hydrodynamics of topological defects . here",
    "we consider the beris - edwards formulation of liquid crystal hydrodynamics@xcite .",
    "this allows for variations in the magnitude of the nematic order parameter and correctly models both defect dynamics and the coupling between the velocity field and the motion of the order parameter .",
    "the beris - edwards equations are complex and previous numerical work to explore different flow regimes is very limited . in ref.@xcite",
    "these equations were used but the problem was simplified by imposing a velocity field and ignoring back - flow ( back - flow refers to the effect of the order parameter dynamics on the velocity field ) . in @xcite an euler solution of a somewhat simpler version of the beris - edwards model was used to study the effect of hydrodynamics on phase ordering in liquid crystals .",
    "however it has recently been shown that the beris - edwards equations can be solved successfully using a lattice boltzmann algorithm @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will extend the lattice boltzmann approach described in @xcite to include the electric field terms necessary for a description of electro - optic device physics . the model is also generalized to include the three elastic constant formula for the deformation free energy of the liquid crystal .",
    "the equations of motion are presented in section ii and an outline of the numerical algorithm in section iii .",

    "is fixed . when an electric field is switched on ,",
    "the molecules align parallel or perpendicular to the field depending on the sign of the anisotropy of the dielectric constant .",
    "after switching off the field , long - range elastic interactions ensure that the molecules reorient themselves in the direction preferred by the surfaces .",
    "the device can be used as a display because different liquid crystal orientations have different optical properties .",
    "switching between different director orientations can take place homogeneously throughout the bulk of the device or it may proceed through domain growth involving the motion of domain walls , together with associated defects @xcite",
    ". the operational state of a device such as a pi - cell may be topologically distinct from its state at zero voltage .",
    "before the device can be used , the operational state must be nucleated and must grow to fill the display .",
    "it is important to examine how this depends on different parameters of the liquid crystal material . in particular liquid crystals",
    "are complex fluids and the speed of domain motion will depend on their hydrodynamic properties .    in section",
    "iv we examine the global stability of two topologically distinct states as a function of the applied voltage and the tilt angle at the plates . in section v we discuss the relevance of defect motion to domain growth between the two states and show that hydrodynamic coupling significantly changes the defect velocities .",
    "we summarize the formulation of liquid crystal hydrodynamics described by beris and edwards@xcite and extended to include electric fields .",

    "we now use the lattice boltzmann algorithm described in sections 2 and 3 to investigate a simple liquid crystal device .",

    "this diagram compares well with those measured experimentally for a system using e7 @xcite .",
    "consider the dynamics of the domain growth in the system . rather than fix parameters to a specific material ,",
    "we wish to explore how the dynamics are affected by different parameters .",
    "in particular , we are interested in how hydrodynamics affects the speed of the domain growth .",
    "this is motivated by the observation in ref .",
    "@xcite that the domain growth was anisotropic and the speculation that this may be due to hydrodynamics . to isolate effects due to different elastic constants , for these simulations we set @xmath99 , the so - called one - elastic constant approximation .",
    "the initial configuration , depicted in fig . [ fig_twodefects](a ) , is a horizontal ( i.e. , along the @xmath97-direction ) domain in an otherwise vertically aligned state .",
    "this models a time shortly after the electric field has been switched off when small but macroscopic domains have formed in the device .",
    "once the simulation commences the director configuration relaxes rapidly to that shown in fig . [",
    "fig_twodefects](b ) .",
    "the horizontal and vertical domains are both tilted slightly by the elastic coupling to the surface spins",
    ". then defects are formed at the domain boundaries , which merge to form single defects with strengths @xmath100 at the centre of each domain wall respectively .",
    "once the two defects have formed the vertical domain begins to grow and the defects move in opposite directions .",
    "our aim is to investigate the effect of back - flow and surface director tilt on this motion .",
    "most previous work on the dynamics of topological defects has ignored the back - flow @xcite .",
    "we first investigate the effect of the surface tilt @xmath101 on the defect speed .",
    "the horizontal domain grows because it decreases the free energy of the device .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the difference in free energy between the horizontal and vertical domains is proportional to @xmath102 , where @xmath101 is the angle of the surface tilt to the @xmath97-axis .",
    "thus as @xmath101 increases , the free energy difference decreases , and the defects move more slowly . at @xmath103",
    "the two domains have the same free energy and the defects stop moving .",
    "for @xmath104 the horizontal domain begins to shrink .",
    "a particular advantage of the simulation is that the back - flow can easily be switched off by setting @xmath105 and @xmath106 to zero in ( [ expansion_in_u ] ) and ( [ eq14 ] ) .",
    "thus the effect of the back - flow can be unambiguously identified .",
    "since no flow is imposed , this leads to a zero velocity field throughout the whole simulation .",
    "the dynamical equation for the system in this case can be obtained from ( [ qevolution ] ) by setting @xmath25 to zero .",
    "it corresponds to a simpler model which does not include hydrodynamics .",
    "consider first the diamonds in fig .",
    "[ fig_defectspeed_tilt ] .",
    "this corresponds to the case with back - flow switched off . for this case",
    "both defects move at the same speed ( but in opposite directions ) .",
    "this can be explained by considering a local co - ordinate transformation @xmath107 which is equivalent to changing the sign of the off - diagonal elements in @xmath0 .",
    "assuming @xmath108 , the dynamical equation ( [ qevolution ] ) is invariant under this transformation whereas the two defects in fig .",
    "[ fig_twodefects](b ) transform into each other .",
    "the triangles and circles in fig . [ fig_defectspeed_tilt ]",
    "show the velocity of the defects when back - flow is included in the model .",
    "now the two defects move with different speeds since the @xmath109 elements of the stress tensors ( [ bestress ] ) and ( [ as ] ) are not invariant under the @xmath107 transformation .",
    "thus the stress fields are different for the two defects . due to this stress field",
    "two different flow fields are formed around the defects ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_velocityfield ] ) . the flow is stronger around the @xmath110 defect and",
    "it is substantially accelerated .",
    "the speed of the @xmath111 defect is affected much less by the flow .    an experimental setup similar to fig .",
    "[ fig_twodefects ] was considered in @xcite where the growth of a circular twist domain in a horizontal environment under the influence of an external field was studied for different surface tilt values .",
    "it was found that the domain growth was anisotropic .",
    "although this problem is three - dimensional , a vertical cross section through the growing domain gives a geometry similar to that considered here .",
    "it seems extremely plausible , that the essential physics is captured by our model with the anisotropy in growth resulting from the difference in the flow fields corresponding to different defect topologies at the defect boundary .",
    "quantitative mappings between the experiment and the simulation results must be treated with caution because of the different dimensionality . however , in both the simulation and the experiment the difference between the wall speeds was about @xmath112 .",
    "the simulations were performed on a @xmath113 grid .",
    "we used @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath91 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 . the larger @xmath120 corresponds to increasing the resolution of the lattice in order to perform accurate defect velocity measurements .",
    "in this paper we have described a lattice boltzmann algorithm to simulate the dynamics of a non - newtonian fluid , liquid crystals .",
    "in particular we have considered the the presence of an external electric field and the possibility of a general frank free energy with three elastic constants . in the continuum limit",
    "we recover the beris - edwards formulation within which the liquid crystal equations of motion are written in terms of a tensor order parameter @xcite .",
    "the equations are applicable to the isotropic , uniaxial nematic , and biaxial nematic phases . working within the framework of a variable tensor order parameter it is possible to simulate variations in the magnitude of order and hence the dynamics of topological defects and non - equilibrium phase transitions between different flow regimes .",
    "the algorithm was used to explore states in nematic liquid crystal devices .",
    "we find that switching between topologically distinct states is , as expected , strongly inhibited by a free energy barrier between the initial and the final states . in this case",
    "the state can only change once a domain of the final state has been nucleated .",
    "defects form at the moving domain walls and hence this geometry allows an investigation of defect hydrodynamics .",
    "we find that a @xmath121 defect is substantially speeded up by back - flow effects .",
    "this is relevant to device physics where the speed of switching is an important design variable .",
    "there are many directions for further research opened up by the rich physics inherent in liquid crystal hydrodynamics and the generality of the beris - edwards equations .",
    "for example , another possible switching pathway would be via the escape of the director into a third dimension .",
    "the addition of flexoelectric terms to the equations of motion will allow problems relevant to bistable liquid crystal displays to be addressed .",
    "even cases where the switching is the consequence of back - flow @xcite can be modeled .",
