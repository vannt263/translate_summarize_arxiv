    "molecular clouds are the birth place of stars , and it is essential to study the formation , evolution and fragmentation of molecular clouds in order to understand star formation .",
    "the star formation process in molecular clouds is driven by a variety of mechanisms and is strongly affected by the presence of high - mass stars .",
    "when massive stars form it is expected that they dominate the formation process of other stars formed later in the same cloud .",
    "heating of the molecular cloud by high - mass stars is likely to inhibit further star formation @xcite . on",
    "the other hand , compression of the cloud , by the action of stellar winds or from the expansion of an h  ii region , will enhance star formation @xcite or even trigger star formation ( via sequential star formation or the collect and collapse process , e.g. , elmegreen & lada 1977 , zavagno et al .",
    "2006 , deharveng et al .",
    "alternatively , the expansion of an h  ii region may even blow the cloud apart ( elmegreen & lada 1976 ) .",
    "these different processes not only affect the rate of star formation within the cloud , but might also be expected to have some effect on the initial mass function ( imf ) of the newly forming stars .",
    "for example , the jeans mass increases with cloud temperature : consequently a warmer cloud is more stable against collapse and the process of fragmentation may result in more massive stars with different star formation rates or efficiencies @xcite .",
    "it is instructive , therefore , to study the molecular gas associated with h  ii regions .",
    "many studies have investigated the star formation process adjacent to h  ii regions ( e.g deharveng et al . 2005 , kirsanova et al .",
    "2008 , kerton 2008 ) .",
    "statistically , it has been shown that the most luminous proto - stars form in molecular clouds associated with h  ii regions @xcite .",
    "other studies suggest that a large fraction of stars originate in clusters ( li et al .",
    "1997 ) , mostly at the peripheries of h  ii regions ( e.g. zavagno et al .",
    "2006 , deharveng et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "embedded clusters are associated with clumps and dense cores within clouds , where there is sufficient gas and dust available to form stars ; therefore , the spatial distribution of clumps and cores should reflect the stellar distribution of recent or future star - forming regions .",
    "there is not a well - accepted unique definition of cores and clumps . in this work",
    ", we call the whole molecular gas associated with the h  ii region _ the cloud _ in which we have resolved three main distinct regions : s175a , s175b and s175c .",
    "we define a _ clump _ to be condensed material within each region that forms structures larger than the telescope beam size .",
    "each clump is expected to contain sub - structure and exhibits one or more peaks in @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) emission : we refer to these simply as _ peaks _ as we can not resolve proto - stellar cores within our maps .",
    "the @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) antenna temperature of the brightest peak within each clump is reported as the clump s temperature and is used to calculate other parameters such as column density and mass .",
    "this is the first paper resulting from a study of ten molecular clouds associated with h  ii regions which are selected from the sharpless catalog of h  ii regions ( sharpless 1959 ) .",
    "we have selected objects in the outer galaxy , primarily along the perseus arm , in order to minimize confusion with background stars and to provide the best estimate of the kinematic distance ( for those objects which have no direct distance determination ) .",
    "s175 is our closest source and therefore provides us with the best linear scale resolution in our sample .",
    "we used the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) to study how the formation of a massive star in this molecular cloud may impact the formation of future stars .",
    "clumps within the molecular cloud are identified and their physical characteristics , such as mass , column density and temperature , are measured from properties of @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) and @xmath3co(2 - 1 ) emission .",
    "we look for the influence of shock fronts on the clumps and , from analysis of line widths , study the possible effects of turbulence and dynamics around the h  ii region .",
    "we describe observation details in  2 and present the results in  3 . in ",
    "4 we present the calculations and the models that we applied to determine physical parameters of the observed regions .",
    " 5 contains a discussion of how the h  ii region has affected the cloud physical characteristics and the paper is summarized in  6 .",
    "at a distance of @xmath4 kpc @xcite , s175 is the closest source in our sample and we are able to resolve smaller structures within the molecular cloud associated with this h  ii region .",
    "the h  ii region has been excited by a b1.5v star ( m @xmath5 9.5 m@xmath6 , holmgren et al .",
    "1997 ) at @xmath7(j2000 ) = @xmath8 and @xmath9(j2000 ) = @xmath10 .",
    "scaife et al .",
    "( 2008 ) calculated a dust temperature of @xmath11 k for s175 by fitting a modified planck spectrum to iras 100 and 60 @xmath12 m flux densities and , using optical recombination lines , also calculated an electron temperature of @xmath13 k. fich and rudolph ( in prep . ) recently calculated a density of 112 @xmath14 and a total mass of 0.4 m@xmath6 for this ionized gas .",
    "wouterloot & habing ( 1985 ) also had reported a @xmath15(1 - 0)=2.5 k and @xmath16=5.7 k toward the associated molecular cloud , but they had low spatial and frequency resolution .    two components , s175a and s175b , in the molecular cloud have previously been identified in an iras survey ( of h  ii regions ) by chan & fich ( 1995 ) . both regions have the same @xmath17 km s@xmath18 and are connected by a recently observed filament of molecular gas with the same velocity .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to assume that s175a and s175b lie at the same distance .",
    "figure [ iras ] shows the position of the cloud in an iras 12 micron map ( left panel ) .",
    "the components of the molecular cloud associated with the s175 h  ii region can not be resolved on the iras map but a recent study with the arcminute microkelvin imager ( ami ) @xcite shows that s175a and s175b , observed at 15.8 ghz , sit on a ring of an extended emission ( figures 2 and 3 in their paper ) .",
    "this ring , with a diameter of @xmath19 or @xmath207 pc , is shown in green in figure [ iras ] ( right panel ) . a third condensation , which we label s175c , in the north - east of the boxed region can be seen but it is not as intense as the two mapped regions .",
    "s175a is adjacent to the h  ii region and is likely to be affected by the ionized gas while s175b , at a distance of @xmath21 pc from the visible edge of the h  ii region ( ten times the stromgren sphere radius ) , is too far away to be affected .",
    "therefore comparison of these two regions may provide significant insight into the effects of the formation of a massive star ( and the subsequent expansion of ionized gas ) on the molecular cloud environment and on the physical properties that may affect future star formation .      in august and november , 1998 , we made jcmt observations in @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) of the two selected regions , s175a and s175b , ( figure [ iras ] ) .",
    "we made a @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) @xmath22 map for each of these regions , with the a3 heterodyne receiver .",
    "the beam size at this frequency is @xmath23 .",
    "data was taken by driving the telescope in right ascension ( sampling step of @xmath24 ) with a 4 second exposure time at each point .",
    "we made a mosaic of 12 sub - maps to complete each of the s175a and s175b maps .",
    "eleven of the sub - maps consist of 5 rows and 59 columns , and one consists of 4 rows and 59 columns to complete 59@xmath059 pixel maps .",
    "the @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) maps were used to study the structure of the s175a and s175b molecular cloud and to search for the @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) peaks within the identified clumps ( see the next section for clump identification rules ) .",
    "@xmath2co(2 - 1 ) is optically thick and can not be used to detect the dense gas embedded within the clumps .",
    "therefore , the position of the brightest @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) emission in each clump were observed in the optically thinner emission lines , @xmath3co(2 - 1 ) and cs(5 - 4 ) .",
    "we made pointed observations toward these positions in august 2005 , december 2007 and july 2008 .",
    "@xmath3co(2 - 1 ) was detected towards all positions but we failed to detect any cs(5 - 4 ) emission within s175a .",
    "the peaks detected in s175b display lower temperatures ; therefore , no cs(5 - 4 ) emission was expected and accordingly no cs pointed observations were made for s175b .",
    "we used a bandwidth of 267.5 mhz with 1713 frequency channels which corresponds to a velocity range of about 350 km s@xmath18 with a resolution of @xmath50.2 km s@xmath18 for @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) .",
    "the @xmath3co(2 - 1 ) and cs(5 - 4 ) pointed observations in s175a were made in frequency switching mode .",
    "we used a frequency switch of 8.3 mhz , a velocity resolution of @xmath50.05 km s@xmath18 and a velocity range of 225 km s@xmath18 .",
    "frequency switching mode was not available while observing s175b and therefore we used a position switching mode to observe @xmath3co(2 - 1 ) .",
    "the system temperature , @xmath25 , was typically 300 - 600 k for @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) mapping and 400 - 500 k for pointed observations .",
    "the typical noise level was 2 k for @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) and 0.3 k for @xmath3co and cs .",
    "we used specx and the starlink splat and gaia packages to reduce the data , make mosaics , remove baselines and fit gaussian functions to determine @xmath26v , the fwhm of the observed line profiles .",
    "we used the @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) maps to study the structure and morphology of the molecular cloud associated with s175 , and to identify clumps within it .",
    "the cloud consists of various clumps of gas that display one or more peaks of emission ( typically towards the centre of the clump ) , see figures [ s175aclumps ] and [ s175bclumps ] .",
    "we define any separated condensation as a distinct clump , if : 1 ) the brightest peak within the region has an antenna temperature larger than five times the rms of the background noise ; 2 ) the drop in antenna temperature between two adjacent bright peaks when moving from one to another is larger than the background noise ; and , 3 ) the size of the condensation is larger than the telescope beam size ( @xmath23 or 3 pixels ) .",
    "the edge of a clump is taken to be the boundary at which the antenna temperature drops to below half of the highest measured temperature within that clump .",
    "an ellipse that best fits to this boundary is considered for clump size and integrated flux measurements .",
    "note that this definition means that clumps can contain several peaks of emission and , in fact , almost half of the detected clumps contain more than one bright peak .",
    "we find the gas velocity in s175a to range from -48 km s@xmath18 to -52 km s@xmath18 , which is consistent with previous studies that found v@xmath27(co)= -49.6 @xmath28 0.5 km s@xmath18 @xcite and -50.3 km s@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) map ( integrated between -48 km s@xmath18 and -52 km s@xmath18 ) overlaid on the optical image of the h  ii region is presented in figure  [ s175a-1 ] and shows that s175a takes the form of a wedge , which lies partially over the h  ii region , and a filament that leads to the north - west .",
    "the brightest @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) emission peak lies at the centre of the region and at a velocity of -49.4 km s@xmath18 .",
    "figure  [ s175a-1 ] also reveals s175a to have a clumpy structure .",
    "we used the clump selection method described above to identify thirteen clumps within s175a , which are indicated in figure [ s175aclumps ] by ellipses and listed in table [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "s175a consists of a bright centre containing clumps c5 , c6 and c9 . flanking",
    "the central area to the east is a ring of clumps , of diameter @xmath29 @xmath30 , consisting of c1 - 4 and c7 ( figure [ s175aclumps ] left panel ) .",
    "we find no evidence for expansion of this ring ; all the clumps display narrow single peaks at the same velocity ( -49.5 @xmath28 0.5 km s@xmath18 ) .",
    "a chain of clumps consisting of c10 - 13 lies to the west of the centre ( figure [ s175aclumps ] right panel ) .",
    "the c8 clump , south of the ring , is the only clump in the same line of sight of the h  ii region .",
    "we are unable to determine whether c8 lies in front of or behind the h  ii region .",
    "@xmath2co(2 - 1 ) is optically thick and can not be used to detect the dense gas within the clumps .",
    "therefore , we observed the brightest peak within each clump using single point observations of @xmath3co(2 - 1 ) and cs(5 - 4 ) , in order to further probe the properties of the clumps in s175a . the observed antenna temperatures , @xmath31 , at these points are listed in table [ tbl-1 ] , and range from 9.6 - 29.1 k for @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) and 2.26 - 17.34 k for @xmath3co(2 - 1 ) .",
    "we failed to detect any cs(5 - 4 ) emission within this cloud , indicating that the densities of the dense centres are less than @xmath29 10@xmath32 @xmath33 .",
    "as noted above , s175a is situated very close to the h  ii region and it could be expected to exhibit signs of turbulence , which could manifest as a large velocity dispersion between the clumps and/or as asymmetric line profiles broadened significantly beyond the thermal line width .",
    "however , we find the spread in velocity of the brightest peaks to be small : -49.0 to -50.8 km s@xmath18 for @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) and -49.0 to -50.9 km s@xmath18 for @xmath3co(2 - 1 ) . furthermore , both @xmath2co and @xmath3co velocity profiles of the peaks are very narrow ( @xmath34 km s@xmath18 for @xmath2co and @xmath35 km s@xmath18 for @xmath3co - see table [ tbl-2 ] ) and symmetric . comparing these line widths with calculated thermal line widths calculated from @xmath16 found in ",
    "[ temptau ] ( @xmath36 km s@xmath18 ) , and assuming @xmath37 , we may conclude that s175a is quiescent region and not dynamically active .      the s175b @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) map , which is integrated between -47 km s@xmath18 and -53 km s@xmath18 , is shown in figure  [ s175b1 ] . in comparison with s175a , s175b is more uniform with an extended co emission averaging @xmath5 5 - 7 k covering more than 80 % of the observed region ( figure [ s175b1 ] , left panel ) .",
    "furthermore , a consistent background noise of @xmath5 2 k exists through the mapped region .",
    "clump identification was therefore more difficult in s175b and was restricted to a region at the north - west that showed a greater degree of dynamical activity than in the rest of the region .",
    "a particularly dynamically active area is highlighted in the right panel ( enlarged square ) of fig .",
    "[ s175b1 ] .",
    "twelve distinct clumps have been resolved within s175b ( figure [ s175bclumps ] ) and are indicated by ellipses , with corresponding positions listed in table [ s175bt1 ] .",
    "most of the clumps are located in the northern part of the cloud and only three clumps ( c4 , c5 and c12 ) have been identified in the southern half .",
    "we are unable to resolve these three clumps any further because the southern half of the cloud is especially uniform and the clumps have irregular shapes with edges that are hard to distinguish from the extended 5 - 7 k co emission .    as for s175a ,",
    "single point observations in @xmath3co(2 - 1 ) were made at the peaks within the clumps ( c12 is yet to be observed in @xmath3co ) .",
    "the observed physical parameters of each of these positions are listed in table [ s175bt1 ] .",
    "we note here that the observed t@xmath38 are generally lower in s175b than s175a ( @xmath39=9.3 - 16.8 k and @xmath40=2.7 k to 6.3 k ) , while s175b shows a slightly wider velocity range at the peaks , with -47.8 km s@xmath18 @xmath41 v(@xmath2co ) @xmath41 -52.2 km s@xmath18 and -47.7 km s@xmath18 @xmath41v(@xmath3co ) @xmath41 -52.0 km s@xmath18 .",
    "in contrast to the narrow and uniform @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) line profiles ( @xmath42 km s@xmath18 ) of the extended gas , the peaks within each clump have wide line profiles ( @xmath43 km s@xmath18 for @xmath2co and @xmath44 km s@xmath18 for @xmath3co - see table [ s175bt2 ] ) . with the exception of c5 , which lies in a somewhat isolated position at the centre in the southern half of the region , the peak position @xmath2co line profiles are asymmetric .",
    "s175b is clearly more dynamically active than s175a . comparing the emission line widths with thermal line widths , ( @xmath45 km s@xmath18 )",
    "confirms that the observed line widths are significantly larger than the thermal velocity dispersion .",
    "furthermore , we see multiply - peaked profiles in @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) , which are identified by letters in table [ s175bt2 ] , in c1-c3 , c7 and c9 ( compare the line widths and profile shapes in figure [ s175bspecs ] ) .",
    "the multiple peak structure could be a result of self - absorption or multiple cores at different velocities along the line of sight . in @xmath3co(2 - 1 ) , we find that c1 - 3 and c7 - 11 appear to be either saturated or self - absorbed .",
    "signatures of self absorption and saturation in @xmath3co can be an indication of warm gas inside the cores .",
    "alternatively , multiple peaks in @xmath3co could support the possibility of multiple cores .",
    "our recent observations in @xmath3co(3 - 2 ) ( azimlu , m@xmath46coey & fich , in prep . ) at c1-c3 shows strong signature of an outflow located at c1 , which could explain multiple peaked profiles for these peaks .",
    "@xmath2co(2 - 1 ) maps have been used to study the morphology of the cloud , and to identify the position of clumps and their size .",
    "these observations also are used to determine the brightest peaks within each clump and measure the physical parameters of each peak , such as antenna temperature , line width and velocity profiles . using these parameters",
    "we can calculate the mass of the clumps assuming virial equilibrium conditions or calculate the velocity integrated ( or `` x - factor '' ) mass , using a known `` x - factor '' ( an empirical ratio of h@xmath47 column density to the velocity integrated @xmath2co(1 - 0 ) emission ) to calculate the h@xmath47 column density .",
    "@xmath2co is optically thick and not suitable to measure the properties of the densest gas ; therefore , we also calculated mass using observations of the brightest peak within each clump in @xmath3co(2 - 1 ) .",
    "we measure the @xmath3co(2 - 1 ) antenna temperature and line width directly from the observed spectrum .",
    "then , assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , we determine the excitation temperature , opacity and gas column density for the observed points .",
    "assuming that clumps are uniformly spherical , we calculate the average volume density , lte mass , and the jeans mass for each clump .      the corrected antenna temperature , @xmath48 , and line widths for both @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) and @xmath3co(2 - 1 ) emission lines were directly measured from spectra , after baseline subtraction . for multiply peaked profiles , we determine a separate line width for each peak only if the separation is greater than 1 km s@xmath18 ( five times of the channel resolution of 0.2 km s@xmath18 ) .",
    "the brightest @xmath2co peak within a multiply peaked spectrum is used in calculation .",
    "@xmath49 , the received brightness temperature , is related to the directly observed antenna temperature through the beam efficiency and beam filling factor ; @xmath50 .",
    "the beam efficiency , @xmath51 , is 0.69 at the jcmt for the observed frequencies , and @xmath52 is the fraction of the telescope beam filled by the source emission .",

    "it is common in molecular clouds studies to define the edge of the clumps based on a detection level above the background ( see  [ larson ] ) .",
    "we were unable to use this boundary selection because of the extended @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) emissions in s175b , which cover @xmath120 of the mapped region .",

    "we note that some of the clump masses might be overestimated for the smallest clumps in our sample as the lower limit to our clump size is given by our beam size ( 0.11 pc at 1.09 kpc ) and therefore the masses found for these clumps are upper limits .",
    "we note that less than one third of our clumps are affected by this issue .",

    "we expected more turbulence and internal motion within s175a due to the proximity of the h  ii region .",
    "indeed , we find that s175a contains the clumps with the highest temperature and the largest column densities ( c5 and c6 ) ; these clumps lie at the edges of the h  ii region and are likely to be material that has been swept up by the expansion of the ionization front and has then condensed .",
    "however , s175b displays the wider line profiles and appears more likely to be subject to turbulent motion .",
    "our recent studies of s175b - c1 in @xmath2co(3 - 2 ) ( azimlu , m@xmath46coey & fich , in prep . ) presents strong evidence of an outflow within this clump .",

    "this is higher than the typical star formation efficiency ( @xmath130% , alves et al .",

    "it is possible that we have not accounted all the material in the region , or maybe part of the initial mass is missed .",
    "fich & rodulph ( in prep . ) calculated a total mass of 0.4 @xmath84 for the ionized gas which accounts only for a very small fraction of the total mass .",
    "we do not have any direct estimation of the atomic hydrogen mass but the atomic hydrogen , which lies in a thin layer around the ionized front , can not contribute significantly ( less than 1% ) to the mass of the cloud @xcite .    the velocity range within the s175 cloud is found to be -47 to -53 km s@xmath18 .",

    "since the expansion velocity decreases with time , this age is an upper limit and swept up material can not have been ejected from the cloud within this short time scale .",
    "we conclude that the material around the s175 h  ii region contain more massive clumps than is typical but can not , with this data , explain why .    as an aside",

    "the clumps in s175b display larger line widths than those in s175a and have larger velocity - integrated and virial masses as a result .",
    "the right panel in figure [ integvir ] shows there is a weak relation between virial and velocity - integrated mass in s175b .",
    "an important point to note from this figure is that s175b is clearly not in virial equilibrium .",
    "we can investigate further this issue by plotting the lte masses against @xmath122 ( figure [ virlte ] ) and against @xmath131 ( figure [ integlte ] ) .",
    "these figures show that the lte masses found are slightly smaller than either the virial or integrated - velocity masses for s175a but noticeably smaller for s175b .",
    "in fact , the virial masses in s175b are up to a factor of 20 larger than @xmath136 .",
    "it is possible that the lte analysis may underestimate the mass because of self - absorption and saturation of the line profiles , this is especially true in s175b where most of the strongest emission lines are self - absorbed or distorted by internal dynamics , even for @xmath3co(2 - 1 ) .",
    "however , we note that the ratio of @xmath131 to @xmath110 for s175b - c1 , -c2 and -c3 , which show evidence of infall and outflow , is the greatest among all the clumps in the s175 region .",

    "in figure [ s175a-4 ] we plot the log of @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) and @xmath3co(2 - 1 ) velocity dispersion versus the effective clump radius in order to investigate the larson relation in s175 .",

    "more recent studies in the galactic plane have also indicated a weak or highly scattered relation @xcite .",
    "although we base our boundary selection on the peak temperature within a clump rather than on a level above the background , we see a poor correlation between size and line width for s175a clumps , however , no correlation is found for s175b .",

    "( 1997 ) noted that the line width - size relation breaks down in massive cores which systematically have higher line widths .",

    "matzner ( 2007 ) modeled outflow - driven turbulence from proto - stars and found that at scales much smaller than the turbulent driving scale the larson relation is obtained . at larger scales , however , the line width - size relation flattens in a similar way to that seen in the right panel of figure [ s175a-4 ] .",

    "the feedback from this outflow is a possible source of turbulence in s175b , at least in the north - western part of the cloud .",
    "presence this outflow indicates that s175b is an active star forming region and older outflows of recently formed stars could be responsible for the observed structure and kinematics of this cloud .",

    "the most likely explanation for this is that s175a has been heated by the h  ii region .",

    "3 .   clumps within s175b are generally larger .",
    "we suggest that clumps within s175a may be partially a product of the  collect and collapse \" effect of ionization fronts from the h  ii region , while a source of turbulence , possibly the outflow , supports the gas within s175b against fragmentation and gravitational collapse .",

    "no relation was found for s175b clumps , which may be a result of a local source of turbulence , due to the outflow , or may be a consequence of the confusion of the clump edges with underly extended gas in s175b .",
