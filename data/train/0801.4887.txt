    "the possibility of the existence of large rapidity gaps in hadronic collisions was suggested a number of years ago @xcite . in @xcite , the occurrence of rapidity regions deprived of soft hadronic debris",
    "was proposed as a means to search for higgs bosons produced by interactions between colour singlet particles , e.g. @xmath0 bosons emitted by initial state quarks , but with a warning against the possibility of soft collisions which would populate these regions . for an estimate , an expression for the large rapidity gaps survival probability ( lrgsp )",
    "was proposed , namely @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the probability in impact parameter space that two hadrons a , b got through each other without detectable inelastic interactions , @xmath3 is the @xmath4distribution for collisions involved in interactions in which only low @xmath5 particle emission can take place , and @xmath6 is the cross - section for producing , say , a higgs boson , in such hadronically deprived silent configuration . to use the above equation , one needs to estimate the probability of @xmath7 having inelastic collisions , @xmath8 and the distribution for low-@xmath5 interactions , namely the probability @xmath3 to find those collisions for which two hadrons a and b at distance @xmath9 will not undergo large @xmath5 collisions .",
    "introducing for the scattered partons a cut - off @xmath10 , above which the scattering process can be described by perturbative qcd , we need to estimate the @xmath4distribution of all the collisions with @xmath11 . in order to calculate @xmath12 , one can approximate the bulk of hadron - hadron collisions with a sum of poisson distributions for @xmath13 independent collisions distributed around an average @xmath14 , namely @xmath15 which also leads to the following expressions for the total and inelastic cross - sections @xmath16\\ ] ] and @xmath17\\ ] ] where @xmath18 can be identified with the imaginary part of the eikonal function @xmath19 .",
    "approximating @xmath20 , allows a simple way of calculating @xmath21 if one has a model for @xmath22 . a possible strategy to calculate",
    "the lrgsp is then to build a model for the total cross - section and then insert the relevant @xmath4distributions in eq.([sob ] ) .",
    "the basic quantity to evaluate is thus @xmath23 where we have split the average number of collisions between those with outgoing partons below ( np ) and above ( hard ) the cut - off @xmath10 . in the next section",
    "we shall describe our model @xcite for total cross - section , comparing its results to other models .",
    "then , we shall use the @xmath4distributions from our model to evaluate the lrgsp at lhc , again comparing it to different model results .",
    "to build a realistic model for @xmath21 , one needs to understand what makes the cross - section rise with a slope compatible with the limits imposed by the froissart theorem , namely @xmath24 . in our model ,",
    "the rise in @xmath21 is driven by the rise of low - x ( perturbative ) gluon - gluon interactions , while the saturation imposed by the froissart bound comes from initial state emission of infrared gluons which temper the too fast rise of the minijet cross - section .",
    "the rise is calculated using perturbative qcd for collisions producing partons with @xmath25 , using hard parton scattering cross - sections , and the experimentally measured and dglap evolved parton densities ( pdf s ) in the scattering hadrons .",
    "thus parton densities and the elements of perturbative qcd are the only input needed for the calculation of @xmath26 . the rate of rise of this cross - section with energy is determined by @xmath10 and the low - x behaviour of the parton densities . as noted before ,",
    "the rise with energy of the cross - section obtained with this is much steeper than that consistent with the froissart bound , but in our model this rise is tempered by soft gluon emission .",
    "the saturation mechanism takes place through the @xmath27-distribution obtained from the fourier transform of the resummed infrared gluon distribution .",
    "this distribution is energy dependent and given by @xcite @xmath28 where the function @xmath29 is obtained through summing soft gluons @xcite and requires integration of soft gluon momenta from zero to @xmath30 the maximum transverse momentum allowed by kinematics to single soft gluons .",
    "the saturation of the froissart bound is due to the increasing acollinearity of `` hard '' partons produced by initial state soft gluon emission .",
    "the single soft gluon distribution needed for the calculation of @xmath31 requires using infra - red @xmath32 gluons and different models with a frozen or singular @xmath33 produce different saturation effects .",
    "we have shown @xcite that the frozen model is inadequate to quench the rise due to minijets , since we see that the early rise in proton - antiproton collisions requires minijets with @xmath34 , but then the total cross - section rises too much . put differently , but equivalently , raising @xmath10 to fit higher energy values of the cross - section , say at the tevatron ,",
    "would require @xmath35 but miss the early rise .",
    "instead , we find that a singular @xmath36 produces an adequate @xmath37dependent saturation effect .",
    "singular expressions for @xmath36 are discussed in the literature , in particular for quarkonium phenomenology @xcite .",
    "our choice is a singular , but integrable expression for the strong coupling constant in the infrared region , namely @xmath38 where the scale factor is chosen to allow a smooth interpolation to the asymptotic freedom expression for @xmath36 , namely we choose @xmath39 the singularity in the infrared is regulated by the parameter @xmath40 , which has to be @xmath41 for the integral in @xmath31 to converge .",
    "the next input for phenomenological tests of our model is the number of non - perturbative ( np ) collisions .",
    "we approximate it as@xmath42 with @xmath43 for the process @xmath44 or @xmath45 .",
    "we choose a constant @xmath46 and use for @xmath47 the same model as for the hard collisions , but we restrict @xmath30 to be no larger than @xmath48 , since these collisions are limited to @xmath11 .",
    "the same function @xmath47 is then used for the lrgsp calculation , as discussed in the next section where both the estimated @xmath49 as well as the lrgsp will be presented and compared with other models .",
    "applying the above described model to the calculation of total cross - sections , gives the results shown in the left panel of figure [ figure1 ] . to obtain this figure ,",
    "we have used different pdf s and slightly different values for the parameters @xmath50 and @xmath10 and the variations are indicated by the band .",
    "we have shown @xcite that the asymptotic behaviour of this cross - section can be fitted with a @xmath51 type behaviour .",
    "this is a phenomenological confirmation that the model satisfies froissart bound .",
    "we do not see in our model any hard pomeron behaviour beyond the initial rise and predict a value @xmath52 .",
    "the lrgsp can now be calculated using the two quantities @xmath53 and @xmath54 which were input in the calculation of the total cross - section .",
    "the right panel of figure [ figure1 ] shows such evaluations , with the yellow band corresponding to various mrst densities @xcite , the central full line to using grv densities @xcite and the other lines and bands representing comparisons with other models , as indicated .",
    "the most interesting result of this figure is that the predictions for lhc agree reasonably well amongst eachother , namely @xmath55 , in spite of the fact that the various models differ greatly in details and the way in which they achieve results for total cross - sections consistent with the froissart bound .",
    "thus the model estimates for the lrgsp are quite robust .",
    "we have built a model for @xmath21 which incorporates hard and soft gluon effects , satisfies the froissart bound and can be used reliably to study other minimum bias effects e.g. the survival probability of large rapidity gaps .",
    "it can also be extended to calculations of total @xmath56 and and @xmath57 cross - sections .",
    "one of us , g.p . , wishes to thank the boston university theoretical physics department for hospitality during the preparation of this talk .",
