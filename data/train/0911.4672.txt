    "the main purpose of this paper is to explore some new points on dynamical systems that have emerged with the study of microscopic traffic modeling using minplus algebra and petri nets .",
    "these points are the following  :    * standard petri nets or linear maxplus algebra have not enough modeling power to describe the dynamics of a traffic system as simple as two roads with a crossing and with the simplest vehicle move . * a remedy to",
    "this difficulty is to introduce possibly negative weights on petri net arcs ( not to be confused with negative places or negative tokens as in  @xcite ) or to use nonlinear minplus dynamics that are not monotonic . *",
    "a consequence is that all known standard methodology based mainly on dynamic programming is ineffective . *",
    "nevertheless , it is sometimes possible to use the standard ergodic theory , and/or to compute a generalized eigenvalue for the subclass of additively homogeneous systems and get nice qualitative results on the system . *",
    "when it is not possible to derive analytical results , we can do numerical simulations . in general",
    ", a microscopic modeling of a realistic system has a very large number of state variables difficult to manage .",
    "however , for the construction of the model , a generalized matrix calculus using minplus algebra can be developed for the class of system described here ( having piecewise affine concave dynamics ) .",
    "all these points are illustrated on the traffic application for which we have obtained a new result : a good analytic approximation of the macroscopic law called the fundamental diagram in the case of roads with junctions .",
    "the traffic on a road has been studied from different points of view on a macroscopic level .",
    "for example :    * the lighthill - whitham - richards model  @xcite , which is the most standard view , expresses the mass conservation of cars seen as a fluid : @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the flow at time @xmath2 and position @xmath3 on the road ; @xmath4 denotes the density ; and @xmath5 is a given function called the _ fundamental traffic diagram_. for traffic , this diagram plays the role of the perfect gas law for the fluid dynamics .",
    "the diagram has been estimated using experimental data , and its behavior is quite different from standard gas at high density .",
    "we obtain an idea of the diagram s shape in the subsection titled `` traffic on a circular road . ''",
    "+ daganzo in @xcite using the variable @xmath6 counting the cumulated number of vehicles having reached the point @xmath3 at time @xmath2 , and remarking that @xmath7 and @xmath8 has interpreted the equation @xmath9 as an hamilton - jacobi equation when @xmath5 is concave .",
    "the other equation @xmath10 telling that @xmath11 .",
    "then , in @xcite , daganzo and geroliminis generalized this to a network by postulating the existence of an hamiltonian in this case also and by trying to approximate it as an infimum of linear constraints that he obtains by physical considerations on the street involved . in @xcite ,",
    "geroliminis and daganzo studied what happen experimentally on real towns . *",
    "the kinetic model ( prigogine - herman  @xcite ) gives the evolution of the density of particles @xmath12 as a function of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath14 is the speed of particles .",
    "the model is given by : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is an interacting term that is , in general , quadratic in @xmath17 and , as such , models the driver behavior in a simple way . from the distribution @xmath17",
    ", we can derive all the useful quantities , such as the average speed @xmath18 .",
    "the integration of the second model is more time consuming and , therefore , not used in practice .",
    "the main interest of the prigogine - herman equation is that we can derive macroscopic laws like the fundamental diagram from its solution .    the first model ( the lighthill - whitham - richards model  @xcite ) assumes the knowledge of the fundamental traffic diagram @xmath5 .",
    "this function has been studied not only experimentally but also theoretically using simple microscopic models such as exclusion processes  @xcite , cellular automata @xcite , or simulation of individual car dynamics . here",
    ", we first recall a way to derive an approximation of this diagram on a circular road , then we present an extension to the two dimensional traffic ( crossing roads ) .",
    "this derivation consists of computing the eigenvalue of a simple minplus linear system counting the number of vehicles entering in a road section .",
    "the main result obtained is the generalization of this fundamental law to the 2d case where the roads cross each other .",
    "in statistical physics , a lot of numerical work ( @xcite ) and good surveys  @xcite have been done on idealized towns .",
    "these works analyze numerical experimentations based on various stochastic models with or without turning possibilities and show the existence of a threshold of the density at which the system blocks suddenly .",
    "the particular case of one junction is studied in  @xcite where precise results are given for the stochastic case without turning possibilities .",
    "let us mention also the attempt to derive a 2d fundamental diagram by helbing  @xcite using queuing theory .",
    "in the saturated and unsaturated traffic case he derives a formula for an intersection that he extends to an area of a town that fits well to experimental datas .    here",
    "we present a deterministic model with turning possibilities , based on petri nets and minplus algebra . the minplus linear model on a unique road",
    "can be described in terms of event graph which is a subclass of petri nets .",
    "the presence of conflicts at junctions prevents the extension of this model to the 2d case .",
    "we propose a way to solve the difficulty by extending the class of weights used in petri nets allowing negative weights .",
    "due to such weights , the firing of a transition can consume tokens downstream , and the modeling power of the petri nets is improved significantly .",
    "this possibility is used to model the authorization to enter in the junctions .",
    "the dynamics of general petri nets allowing negative weights can be written easily but is neither linear in minplus algebra nor monotone .",
    "nevertheless , in the traffic applications given here , dynamics ( @xmath19 ) are always homogeneous of degree one ( @xmath20 , where @xmath21 denotes the minplus multiplication that is the standard addition ) . for such systems , the eigenvalue problem ( computation of @xmath22 such that @xmath23 ) can be reduced to a fixed point problem .",
    "the existence of the growth rate @xmath24 is due to the existence of a birkhoff average .",
    "the quantities @xmath22 and @xmath25 coincide when @xmath5 is also monotone , but this is not true in the general case .",
    "the monotone case has been studied carefully in  @xcite . in traffic examples of roads with junctions ,",
    "the dynamics is not monotone .    in all the traffic examples , we study systems of roads on a torus without entries , in such a way that the number of vehicles remains constant in the system .",
    "thus , we represent an idealization of constant densities for a more realistic system . to maintain a constant density in an open system ,",
    "a new vehicle has to enter each time another one leaves the system .",
    "this is mathematically equivalent to consider circular roads .",
    "if we want to maintain a constant local density in a large system , it is the same problem ; each time a vehicle leaves the local subsystem , another one has to enter .",
    "we study indetail the particular case of two circular roads with one junction .",
    "for this system , a result on the existence of the growth rate is obtained using the nondecreasing trajectory property of the states starting from zero . from this result , we show that the distances between the states stay bounded . the eigenvalue problem can be solved explicitly . on simulation , we see that the eigenvalue and the growth rate generally do not coincide",
    ". however , these quantities are very close for any fixed density .",
    "therefore , the simple formulas obtained for the eigenvalue give a good approximation of the traffic fundamental diagram .    this definition of the fundamental diagram must not be confused with the one used by daganzo  @xcite , which is the hamiltonian of the traffic dynamics interpreted as a dynamic programming equation in the simplest case of a single road and generalized in heuristic way to the city case .",
    "his fundamental diagram mainly coincides with our minplus dynamics , in the case of one street , but is observed experimentally not derived of a microscopic model as we do here .",
    "the dependence of the eigenvalue or the average growth rate with the density of vehicles in the system , which is a difficult result to obtain even in the case of two streets with one intersection , is not done in the daganzo work . moreover , for the city case , we remark also , on the simple example studied here , that the dynamics is not a standard dynamic programming equation associated to a deterministic or a stochastic control problem ( since the dynamics is not monotone ) which could be a problem , at least at the conceptual level , for the point of view adopted by daganzo .",
    "the fundamental diagram that we obtain for a system of two roads with one junction , shows four phases :    * _ free phase _ : the density is low where the vehicles do not interact . *",
    "_ saturation phase _ : the junction is saturated , but the locations downstream of the junction are freed when a vehicle wants to leave the junction . *",
    "_ recession phase _ : the locations downstream of the junction are sometimes crowded when a vehicle wants to leave the junction . * _ freeze phase _ : the vehicles can not move .",
    "these phases are derived from a unique simple model and are not postulated to obtain different models subsequently analyzed .",
    "preliminary results on the traffic dynamics have been presented in  @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "many developments , complementary results , and other completely solved examples can be found .",
    "the theorems given here on the eigenvalue problem and the growth rate complete some of the main results of  @xcite by relaxing some assumptions and clarifying the growth rate existence problem .    we show that a system theory can be developed for the class of concave polyhedral 1-homogeneous systems , which we construct using parallel , series , and feedback compositions .",
    "moreover , the dynamics of these systems are characterized by the composition of a standard matrix and a minplus matrix .",
    "the sum of the entries in each line of the standard matrix is equal to one .",
    "we can compute easily the transformation on these two matrices corresponding to the three composition operations .",
    "the interest of this `` system theory '' can be shown by building the traffic dynamics of a regular town starting from three elementary systems .",
    "we do not detail the construction , but we show a stationary vehicle distribution obtained for a simple regular town with dynamics built in that way . in this case , the fundamental diagrams still present the four phases observed in the simple case of two roads with one junction .",
    "all the numerical simulations have been done using the scicoslab software  @xcite .",
    "this paper is divided into three parts .",
    "first , we recall the basic results of minplus algebra ; we present a system theory for polyhedral concave 1-homogeneous systems and discuss their growth rate and eigenvalue problems .",
    "second , we present petri nets allowing negative weights .",
    "third , we give applications to the computation of the fundamental traffic diagram ; we consider the case of one circular road with minplus linear dynamics and study the case of two circular roads with a junction in detail ; then , we explain briefly the way to build the dynamics using the system theory described in the first part .",
    "in this section , we revisit the main definitions and properties of the minplus algebra .",

    "we can also see @xcite for construction of invariant measures of stochastic recursions .    coming back to the tent example , according to the initial value @xmath203 , the tent iterations @xmath211 stay in circuits or follow trajectories without circuit ( possibly dense in @xmath187 $ ] ) .",
    "for example , assuming that the initial condition is @xmath212 , the trajectory is periodic of period 2 .",
    "the invariant measure is @xmath213 the growth rate is @xmath214 , which is again different from the eigenvalues @xmath71 and @xmath192 .",
    "moreover , it can be shown that for all initial conditions with a finite binary development ( this set contains all the float numbers of computers ) , the trajectory stays in the unstable fixed point @xmath71 after a finite number of steps .",
    "that is , for a dense set of initial conditions the invariant measure is @xmath215 and the growth rate is @xmath71 .",
    "we present , in min - plus - times algebra , timed continuous petri nets with weights .",
    "the weights can be negative and the numbers of tokens are not necessary integer ( in continuous petri nets , what we call tokens are in fact fluid amounts ) .    a petri net @xmath216 is a graph with two sets of nodes ( the _ transitions _ @xmath217 ( with @xmath218 elements ) and the _ places _ @xmath219 ( with @xmath220 elements ) ) and two sorts of edges , ( the _ synchronization edges _ ( from a place to a transition ) and the _ production edges _ ( from a transition to a place ) ) .",
    "a minplus @xmath221 matrix @xmath222 , called _ synchronization matrix _ is associated to the synchronization edges . @xmath223 if there exists an edge from the place @xmath224 to the transition @xmath225 , and @xmath226 elsewhere , where @xmath227 is the _ initial marking _ of the place @xmath54 , which is , graphically , the number of tokens in @xmath54 .",
    "we suppose here that the sojourn time in all the places is one unit of time .    a standard algebra @xmath228 matrix @xmath148 , called _ production matrix _ is associated with the production edges .",
    "it is defined by @xmath229 if there exists an edge from @xmath230 to @xmath54 , and @xmath71 elsewhere , where @xmath231 is the _ multiplicity _ of the edge .",
    "therefore , a petri net is characterized by the quadruple : @xmath232 a petri net is a dynamic system in which the token ( fluid ) evolution is partially defined by the transition firings , saying that a transition can fire as soon as all its upstream places contain a positive quantity of tokens ( fluid ) having stayed at least one unit of time . when a transition fires , it consumes a quantity of tokens ( fluid ) equal to the minimum of all the available quantities being in the upstream places . cumulating the firings done up to present time defines the _ cumulated transition firing _ of the transition .",
    "the firing produces a quantity of tokens ( fluid ) in each downstream place equal to the firing of the transition multiplied by the multiplicity of the corresponding production edge .",
    "if the multiplicity of a production edge , going from @xmath230 to @xmath54 , is negative , the firing of @xmath230 consumes tokens ( fluid ) of @xmath54 .",
    "a general petri net defines constraints on the transition firing . denoting by @xmath233 the cumulated firings of transitions @xmath234 up to instant @xmath161",

    "being at time @xmath161 , we know ( from the firing definition of transitions ) that after the firing ( which is instantaneous ) , there is at least one place upstream of any transition in which no token entered before time @xmath241 . for each transition @xmath230 ,",
    "the equation  ( [ gpetri ] ) computes the number of tokens which have stayed at least one unit of time in each place @xmath242 .",
    "the equation expresses that at least one place is empty and the others have nonnegative numbers of tokens .",
    "as long as there is more than one edge leaving a place , the trajectory of the system is not well - defined because we do not know the path of a token leaving this place .    in the case of a",
    "_ deterministic _",
    "petri net ( generally called conflict free petri net ) where all the places have only one downstream edge , the dynamics are well - defined , meaning there is no token consumption conflicts between the transitions downstream of each place . then , denoting by @xmath243 the vector of sequences of cumulated firing quantities of transitions , and by @xmath244 the vector of sequences of cumulated token quantities arrived in the places at time @xmath161 , we have : @xmath245    in equation  ( [ dynamic ] ) , @xmath246 counts the number of tokens available ( for firing in the downstream transitions ) at time @xmath247 coming from the upstream transition firings .",
    "it is obtained by summing the weighted firing numbers of the transitions upstream the places since the tokens are supposed to stay at least one unit of time in the places .",
    "the part about @xmath248 in equation  ( [ dynamic ] ) tells that the transition firing numbers at time @xmath247 are equal to the minimal token numbers in the places upstream the transitions .",
    "to obtain these quantities we have only to add the token numbers in the place at initial time to the numbers entered by the firings that are the entries of @xmath246 .    from these dynamics ,",
    "we deduce the dynamics of the cumulated firing quantities by eliminating the place variables .",
    "we deduce the dynamics of the cumulated token quantities by eliminating the transition variables . @xmath249    in the case of _ event graphs _ ( particular deterministic petri nets where all the multiplicities @xmath231 are equal to @xmath145 and all the places have exactly one edge upstream ) , the dynamics are linear in the minplus sense  : @xmath250 where @xmath251 with @xmath54 the unique place between @xmath230 and @xmath252 .      by using negative weights and/or fixing a routing policy ,",
    "it is possible to transform a petri net with conflicts to a deterministic petri net .",

    ". these two ways are equally useful for traffic applications as we will see later .",
    "* by specifying the routing policy ( for example we choose arbitrarily that half of the total tokens available are given to @xmath254 and half to @xmath253 , see  @xcite for results on the general routing case ) : ] @xmath258 the minplus product of the two equations gives the constraint  ( [ constr ] ) .",
    "* by choosing a priority rule ( top priority to @xmath254 against @xmath253 ) ] : @xmath259 the last equation implies that the initial constraint  ( [ constr ] ) is satisfied .",
    "we see that the negative weights on @xmath260 and on @xmath261 are essential to express this priority .    in the two cases ,",
    "we obtain a _ degree one homogeneous minplus _ system .",
    "we can define a petri net with inputs and outputs in the following way .",
    "we partition the transition set in three parts @xmath262 : the input set @xmath263 , the state set @xmath264 and the output set @xmath265 .",
    "we do the same for the place set and we get the three parts @xmath266 .",
    "the inputs are the transitions [ resp .",
    "places ] without upstream edges .",
    "the outputs are the ones without output edges .",
    "then the dynamics can be rewritten : @xmath267 these dynamics , denoted by @xmath102 and defined by the matrices @xmath268 , associate the output signals @xmath269 to the input signals @xmath270 .",
    "we write @xmath271 .",
    "these systems can be considered as a special case of an extension of the generalized system described in the minplus section . in this special case ,",
    "some blocks are null and an implicit part can appear .",
    "the three operations ( parallel , series , and feedback compositions ) described previously can be extended easily to this case .",
    "let us recall the simplest model to derive the fundamental traffic diagram on a single road .",
    "the best way to obtain this diagram is to study the stationary regime on a circular road with a given number of vehicles .",
    "we present two ways to obtain this diagram : one is by logical deduction from an exclusion process point of view ( it shows clearly the presence of two distinct phases ) , and the other by computing the eigenvalue of a minplus system derived from a simple petri net modeling of the road ( this way will be extended to the case of roads with junctions ) . in the following , the road is cut in @xmath272 sections which can contain at most one vehicle .",
    "following  @xcite , we can consider the dynamical system defined by the rule @xmath273 applied to a binary word @xmath274 .",
    "the word @xmath275 describes the vehicle positions at instant @xmath161 on a road cut in sections ( each bit representing a section , 1 meaning occupied and 0 meaning free , see ii in figure-[ruta ] ) .",
    "let us take an example : @xmath276    let us define :  the _ density _ @xmath17 by the number of vehicles @xmath277 divided by the number of sections @xmath272 : @xmath278 ,  the flow @xmath279 at time @xmath2 by the number of vehicles going one step forward at time @xmath2 divided by the number of sections .",
    "then the _ fundamental traffic diagram _ gives the relation between @xmath279 and @xmath17 .    if @xmath280 , after a transient period , all the vehicle groups split off , and then all the vehicles can move forward without other vehicles in the way , and we have : @xmath281 if @xmath282 , the free place groups split off after a finite time and move backward without other free places in the way .",
    "then @xmath283 vehicles move forward and we have : @xmath284    @xmath285    this result has been proved in @xcite .",
    "let us give the idea of the proof .",
    "we only have to prove that after a finite number of steps , the separations of vehicles or holes appear .    assuming that the density is not greater than 1/2 ,",
    "let us look what happens at a cluster of at least two vehicles denoted by a. there are two cases :    * the cluster behind a is separated from a by one hole , we have the configuration 10a0 .",
    "then at the next step we have 0a01 .",
    "the cluster a has gone backward by one place . *",
    "the cluster behind is separated from a by more than one hole , we have the configuration 00a0 .",
    "then at the next step , the size of a has been reduced by one .    then after a finite number of steps , bounded by the number of places , the size of each cluster of vehicles is reduced strictly .",
    "indeed , the density being not greater than 1/2 , and individual vehicles going forward , there is cluster of vehicles that must meet a cluster of at least two holes .    for a density larger than 1/2 , we follow the cluster of holes instead of vehicles .",
    "we can show by the same arguments that their sizes decrease or they go forward .",
    "therefore after a finite number of steps the holes are separated by vehicles .",
    "consider the petri net given in iii of figure-[ruta ] which describes the same dynamics in a different way .",
    "in fact , this petri net is an event graph .",
    "therefore , the dynamics are linear in minplus algebra .",
    "the number of vehicles entered in the section @xmath286 before time @xmath161 is denoted @xmath287 .",
    "the initial vehicle position is given by the booleans @xmath288 which take the value @xmath145 when the cell contains a vehicle and @xmath71 otherwise .",
    "we use the notation @xmath289 .",
    "then , the dynamics are given by : @xmath290 which can be written linearly in minplus algebra : @xmath291 where the index addition is done modulo @xmath272 .",
    "the average transition speed ( car flow ) @xmath292 depends on the car density @xmath17 according to the law : @xmath293    this event graph has three kinds of elementary circuits : the outside circuit with average weight @xmath294 ; the inside circuit with average weight @xmath295 ; and the circuits on which some steps are made forward and then back with the average mean 1/2 . therefore , using theorem  [ eigenth ] , its eigenvalue is @xmath296 which gives the average speed as a function of the vehicle density since the minplus eigenvalue is equal to @xmath297 for all @xmath51 .      before discussing the dynamics of the town , let us study in detail the case of two circular roads with a junction ( see the top - right side of figure-[junctionsimp ] ) .",
    "a first trial is to consider the petri net given in the middle of figure-[junctionsimp ] .",
    "this petri net is not an event graph .",
    "it is a general non deterministic petri net .",
    "we can write the dynamics of this petri net using equation-[gpetri ] , but these equations do not uniquely determine the trajectories of the system .",
    "we have two places with two outgoing edges , @xmath298 and @xmath299 . at place",
    "@xmath298 , we have to specify the _ routing policy _ giving the proportion of cars going towards @xmath300 and the proportion going towards @xmath301 . at place",
    "@xmath299 , we may follow _ the first arrived the first served rule with the right priority _ when two vehicles want to enter in the junction simultaneously . using petri net with negative weights ,",
    "we obtain the petri net of figure-[junctionsimp ] where the junction is described precisely in the top - left part of the figure . in the place @xmath298 [ resp @xmath302",
    "are accumulated the cars going towards west [ resp . towards south ] . in the place @xmath299 [ resp .",
    "@xmath303 are accumulated the authorizations to enter in the junction from north [ resp . from east ] .",
    "these authorizations are obtained by subtracting the authorizations to enter from east [ resp . from north ] from the total number of authorizations to enter in the junction .",
    "see section  [ dpetri ] to have a precise description of the management of the priority rule .",
    "we remark that we have obtained a deterministic ( conflict free ) petri net with some negative weights .",
    "the dynamics describing the evolution of the vehicle number entered in section @xmath286 before time @xmath161 denoted @xmath304 can be obtained immediately from the petri net of the top left corner of figure-[junctionsimp ] using the minplus notation discussed in section-[maxplus ] .",
    "@xmath305    where the entries satisfy the following constraints ( written with the standard notations ) :    * @xmath306 for @xmath307 .",
    "these initial markings give the presence , @xmath145 , or absence , @xmath71 , of a vehicle in the road sections .",
    "however , here we see vehicles as fluid and can relax this integer constraint",
    ". moreover , the transition firing cuts the tokens , and if we want to see the systems after some firings , there is not necessarily an integer number of tokens in a place .",
    "therefore , it is better to accept real numbers of tokens belonging to the @xmath187 $ ] interval ; * @xmath308 for @xmath309 they give the initial free spaces in the places ; * @xmath310 the maximum number of cars in the junction is 1 ; * @xmath311 give the free place in the junction .",
    "we remark that the system is homogeneous of degree 1 and that it is easy to write the dynamics using the generalized matrix product .",
    "indeed , all the `` monomials '' appearing in the right hand side of system  [ 2ddyna ] ( for example @xmath312 ) are linear in the standard algebra and can be computed by a standard matrix product from the @xmath230 vector .",
    "then it is easy to obtain the complete right hand side from all the appearing `` monomials '' by a minplus matrix product .",
    "this matrix form is very useful to simulate the system in scicoslab  @xcite since the minplus matrix product is implemented in this software .",

    "<S> motivated by microscopic traffic modeling , we analyze dynamical systems which have a piecewise linear concave dynamics not necessarily monotonic . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a deterministic petri net extension where edges may have negative weights . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of these petri nets are well - defined and may be described by a generalized matrix with a submatrix in the standard algebra with possibly negative entries , and another submatrix in the minplus algebra . </S>",
    "<S> when the dynamics is additively homogeneous , a generalized additive eigenvalue may be introduced , and the ergodic theory may be used to define a growth rate under additional technical assumptions . in the traffic example of two roads with one junction , </S>",
    "<S> we compute explicitly the eigenvalue and we show , by numerical simulations , that these two quantities ( the additive eigenvalue and the growth rate ) are not equal , but are close to each other . with this result , we are able to extend the well - studied notion of fundamental traffic diagram ( the average flow as a function of the car density on a road ) to the case of two roads with one junction and give a very simple analytic approximation of this diagram where four phases appear with clear traffic interpretations . </S>",
    "<S> simulations show that the fundamental diagram shape obtained is also valid for systems with many junctions . to simulate these systems </S>",
    "<S> , we have to compute their dynamics , which are not quite simple . for building them in a modular way </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce generalized parallel , series and feedback compositions of piecewise linear concave dynamics . </S>"
