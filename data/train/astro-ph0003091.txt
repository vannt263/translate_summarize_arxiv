    "the @xmath1 pspc and hri detectors have provided x - ray images for a large number of open clusters sampling the age range from @xmath6  20 to 600  myr ( e.g. , randich @xcite and references therein ; jeffries @xcite and references therein ; see also belloni @xcite , for a review on older open clusters ) .",
    "the data have allowed investigating in great detail the dependence of x - ray activity on mass , age , rotation , and , in particular , to check the validity of the rotation  activity  age paradigm .",
    "the overall picture emerging from @xmath1 generally confirms that there is a tight dependence of x - ray activity on rotation ( or on the so called rossby number , the ratio of the rotation period over the convective turnover time ",
    "e.g. , noyes et al .",
    "@xcite ) and , through rotation , on age : the level of x - ray activity increases with increasing rotation and , since stars spin down as they age , the average or median x - ray luminosity decays with increasing age .",
    "however , the x - ray luminosity ( or x - ray over bolometric luminosity ) does not depend simply on some power of the rotational rate , and the activity  age dependence can not be described by a skumanich  type power law .",
    "in addition , a few puzzling results have arisen from @xmath1 data .",
    "for example , the finding that the bulk of the population of praesepe solar - type stars have a significantly lower x - ray luminosity than the coeval hyades and coma berenices clusters ( randich & schmitt @xcite ; randich et al .",
    "@xcite ) has casted doubts on the common thinking that a unique activity  age relationship holds , and , consequently , that the x - ray properties of a cluster of a given age are representative of all clusters of the same age . a study by barrado y navascus et al .",
    "( @xcite ) seems to exclude that this result is due to a strong contamination of the praesepe sample by cluster non - members ; at the same time , @xmath1 observations of ngc  6633 suggest that this cluster , which is coeval to the hyades and praesepe , is more praesepe  like than hyades  like ( franciosini et al . @xcite ; totten et al .",
    "we also mention that the comparison of the pleiades ( 120  myr ) with ngc  6475 ( 200  myr ) and with other clusters with ages of the order of 100200 myr also suggests that a tight / unique age  activity relationship may not hold ( e.g. randich @xcite ) .",
    "the issue of the uniqueness of the activity  age relationship is therefore not at all settled .",
    "in addition to optical studies that should ascertain cluster membership and provide complete ( or close to completeness ) lists of members and better defined cluster ages , additional , and possibly deeper , x - ray surveys of samples of coeval clusters are clearly required to further address this problem .",
    "we present here a @xmath1 study of the ngc  3532 cluster : ngc  3532 is a very rich southern open cluster with an estimated age @xmath0 myr ( fernandez & salgado @xcite ; johansson @xcite ; eggen @xcite ; koester & reimers @xcite ; meynet et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; it is therefore a good candidate to investigate the x - ray activity  age  rotation relationship at ages intermediate between the pleiades and the hyades , where , to our knowledge , x - rays studies exist for only one cluster ( ngc  6475 ) .",
    "the most likely value for the reddening of ngc  3532 is @xmath7 ( fernandez & salgado @xcite ; eggen @xcite ; schneider @xcite ; meynet et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; the metallicity of the cluster has been estimated to be close to solar ( [ fe / h ] @xmath8 ; clari & lapasset @xcite )",
    ". the cluster is located at very low galactic latitude ( @xmath9  deg ) .",
    "distance determinations range from 405@xmath10  pc ( from hipparcos ; robichon et al .",
    "@xcite ) to 500 pc ( eggen @xcite ) ; in this paper the most recent value of 405 pc by robichon et al . ( @xcite ) has been adopted .",
    "the first detailed study of ngc  3532 was carried out by koelbloed ( @xcite ) , who obtained photoelectric or photographic photometry and proper motions for 255 stars down to a limiting magnitude @xmath11 .",
    "a new proper motion survey of these stars was later performed by king ( @xcite ) .",
    "the most extensive study of this cluster is the photometric study by fernandez & salgado ( @xcite ) , who obtained photoelectric and photographic photometry for 700 stars ( including nearly all koelbloed s stars ) down to a limiting magnitude @xmath12 .",
    "photoelectric photometry for another 24 stars down to @xmath13 was obtained by butler ( @xcite ) .",
    "we mention in passing that only 15 g  type and 7 k  type dwarf cluster members are present in the total sample of 724 stars . additional photometric studies of these stars have been performed by johansson ( @xcite ; ubv , 16 stars ) , eggen ( @xcite ; strmgren , 33 stars ) , wizinowich & garrison ( @xcite ; ubvri , 68 stars ) , schneider ( @xcite ; strmgren , 164 stars ) and clari & lapasset ( @xcite ; ubv and ddo , 12 stars ) .",
    "radial velocities are available for about a hundred stars from the studies by harris ( @xcite ) and by gieseking ( @xcite , @xcite ) . gieseking ( @xcite )",
    "derived a mean cluster radial velocity @xmath14 km / s .",
    "our input catalog is based on the lists of stars by fernandez & salgado ( @xcite ) and butler ( @xcite ) . from these lists",
    ", we selected as _ probable _ members those stars with radial velocity , when available , within 4 km / s ( i.e. @xmath15 ) of the cluster mean @xmath16 , or with membership probability from proper motions greater than 80% , or which were suggested as members in photometric studies .",
    "we rejected stars that would be considered members according to either radial velocity or proper motion , but with photometry inconsistent with cluster membership . for stars with no individual membership information , but with ubv photometry available , we accepted as _",
    "possible _ members those falling in a band between @xmath17 below and @xmath18 above the cluster main sequence .",

    "[ cmd ] we show the @xmath19 vs. @xmath20 c  m diagram for the probable and possible members in our field of view .",
    "it is evident from the figure that the majority of the known members are early - type stars . except for three very late possible cluster members",
    ", the cluster main sequence is truncated at @xmath21 , corresponding to g  type stars ; only 13 g  type and 5 k  type members ( excluding giants ) are present in our catalog , compared to 104 b  a and 48 f stars .",

    "[ lxbv]a ) population exists that was not detected in the two @xmath1 surveys of this cluster .",
    "the comparison of the xldf of ngc  6475 with that of the pleiades or other young clusters indeed suggests that this is a very likely possibility .",
    "such a population would contribute to the low luminosity tail of ngc  6475 distribution function ; nevertheless , fig .",
    "[ lxbv]a indicates that , as a matter of fact , ngc  3532 also lacks the high luminosity population that is present in ngc  6475 .",
    "we conclude that , although the presence of an x - ray faint population in ngc  6475 would partly reduce the inconsistency between the two clusters , it could not completely cancel it , unless one assumes that the low x - ray luminosity population of ngc  6475 is 510 times more numerous than the high luminosity one ; * c ) * the ngc  3532 sample is incomplete and the membership for most of the late - type cluster members is based on photometry only . therefore , on the one hand , our optical sample could be highly contaminated by non - members and , on the other hand , several other optically unknown members could exist .",
    "if all or most of the 21 x - ray sources without a known optical counterpart turn out to be solar - type ( or later ) cluster members and , at the same time , part of the optically selected members turn out to be non - members , the discrepancy between ngc  6475 and ngc  3532 would possibly be solved .",
    "the 21 unidentified x - ray sources if located at the cluster distance would have x - ray luminosities in the range @xmath62 erg  sec@xmath3 ; if all these sources were g  type cluster members , the xldf for ngc  3532 would have indeed a median @xmath63 , slightly lower than the median for ngc  6475 ( 29.4 ) .",

    "real _ difference between the x - ray properties of the two clusters . in this case",
    ", two hypothesis could be made : _",
    "i ) _ ngc  3532 is actually older than ngc  6475 ; _ ii ) _ ngc  6475 and ngc  3532 are about coeval , and our result represents an additional piece of evidence that the age ",
    "activity relationship is not unique .",
    "[ lxbv]b indeed indicates that the x - ray properties of ngc  3532 may be more similar to those of the hyades than to ngc  6475 .",
    "using again the two sample tests , we find that the hypothesis that ngc  3532 and hyades solar - type stars are drawn from the same parent population can be excluded with a confidence level ranging between 95 and 98 % , depending on the adopted test .",
    "we mention that the age of ngc  3532 has been generally estimated using c ",
    "m diagram fitting or , in two cases , from the magnitude of the turn - off .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction different methods result in an age between 200 myr ( fernandez & salgado @xcite ; johansson @xcite ) and 350 myr ( eggen @xcite ) ; the most recent determinations give @xmath64 myr ( koester & reimers @xcite ; meynet et al .",
    "@xcite ) . note that meynet et al .",
    "( @xcite ) using the same method / isochrones derived an age of @xmath65 myr for ngc  6475 ; it seems , therefore , that ngc  3532 might be slightly older than ngc  6475 , but not as old as the x - ray data would suggest .",
    "we have analyzed @xmath1 archive data of the open cluster ngc  3532 .",
    "the comparison of the x - ray properties of solar - type stars in the cluster with those of the supposedly coeval ngc  6475 cluster indicates that ngc  3532 is considerably x - ray underluminous with respect to ngc  6475 .",
    "if this result is not due to selection effects and biases in the two cluster samples , it would provide an additional piece of evidence that the x - ray activity  age relationship is not unique and that other parameters , in addition to rotation , determine the level of coronal emission .",
    "however , before such a conclusion can be accepted , additional x - ray and optical observations should be performed .",
    "namely , * i. * an additional x - ray survey of ngc  6475 should be carried out ; the survey should be deeper than the @xmath1 ones so that , if present , an x - ray faint population of cluster members could be detected ; * ii . * additional photometric and spectroscopic studies of ngc  3532",
    "should be carried out in order to confirm cluster membership for the optical candidates known at present and to detect still unidentified solar - type and lower mass stars in the cluster .",
    "these studies would also provide information on rotation for cluster members ; * iii . *",
    "if possible , an effort should also be done , once more low - mass cluster members are known , to provide a definitive estimate of the cluster age using also low main - sequence fitting .    besides the 15 cluster members , the x - ray survey resulted in the detection of 13 foreground / background stars  which is not surprising given the low cluster galactic latitude  and of 21 objects without any known optical counterparts .",
    "priority should be given to optical observations aimed at determining the nature of these sources , and , in particular , at ascertaining whether they are cluster members or not .",
