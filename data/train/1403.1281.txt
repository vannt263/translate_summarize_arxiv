    "all of the classical hypergeometric ( monic ) orthogonal polynomials @xmath0 within askey scheme @xcite satisfy the following second - order linear difference equation @xmath1 where the coefficients @xmath2 and @xmath3 are polynomials or rational functions of @xmath4 .",
    "for instance , the charlier polynomials correspond to @xmath5 and @xmath6 ; the hermite polynomials correspond to @xmath7 and @xmath8 ; and the chebyshev polynomials correspond to @xmath7 and @xmath9 . in this paper",
    ", we will provide a complete plancherel - rotach asymptotic analysis of second - order difference equations with linear coefficients , namely , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are linear functions of @xmath4 . upon a shift on @xmath10",
    ", we may assume @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "there are plenty of methods developed for asymptotic analysis of orthogonal polynomials : if the polynomials can be expressed in terms of an integral , one may adopt the classical laplace s method and steepest - descent method @xcite ; if the polynomials satisfy a second - order linear differential equation , the well - known wkb method @xcite can be applied ; if the polynomials have an explicit orthogonal weight with certain nice properties , we may use the riemann - hilbert approach and deift - zhou nonlinear steepest - descent method @xcite",
    ". however , few studies in the previous literature were considering asymptotic analysis of polynomials via difference equations due to the loss of continuity .",
    "van assche and geronimo @xcite did some pioneer works in this field and obtained asymptotic formulas in the outer region , where trapezoidal rule was used to build a bridge from discreteness to continuity .",
    "wong and li @xcite derived two linearly independent solutions in the oscillatory region , while determining the coefficients of the linear combination of the two solutions with given initial values was left as an open problem . in a series of work @xcite ,",
    "wang and wong established a beautiful lemma on airy functions to derive uniform asymptotic formulas near the turning points .",
    "it is noted that their results were based on the assumption that the asymptotic formulas in the oscillatory region were given .",
    "recently , wang and wong @xcite completed this framework by introducing a matching method to determine the coefficients of linear combination of wong - li solutions in the oscillatory region from van assche - geronimo solutions in the outer region .",
    "therefore , a systematic method of asymptotic analysis on difference equations was formulated .",
    "this method was successively applied in the study of several indeterminate moment problems @xcite where only difference equations were known and thus the classical laplace s method , steepest descent method , wkb method , riemann - hilbert approach and deift - zhou nonlinear steepest - descent method seem to be unapplicable .    to further develop the difference equation technique , we study a general second - order linear difference equation with linear coefficients .",
    "we are interested in the plancherel - rotach asymptotic formulas of solutions in the outer region and oscillatory region .",
    "according to the signs of the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 , we classify the equations into six cases : i.a ) @xmath15 and @xmath16 ; i.b ) @xmath15 and @xmath17 ; i.c ) @xmath15 and @xmath18 ; ii.a ) @xmath19 and @xmath16 ; ii.b ) @xmath19 and @xmath17 ; ii.c ) @xmath19 and @xmath18 .",
    "the cases with @xmath20 can be transformed to the cases with @xmath15 by a simple reflection .",
    "note that the classical orthogonal polynomials ( charlier , hermite and chebyshev , for instance ) always have nonnegative @xmath21 and their zeros are always real .",
    "however , if we choose @xmath17 , as we shall see later , the zero distributions of the polynomials @xmath0 may lie on the imaginary line ( subcase ii.b ) or even on a sideways y - shape curve ( subcase i.b ) .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we focus on the case @xmath22 and divide this case into three subcases according to the sign of @xmath14 . in section 3 , we investigate the special case @xmath19 and again consider three subcases @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 in three subsections , respectively .",
