    "classical ldpc codes , it hardly needs to be recalled , come together with very efficient and fast decoding algorithms and overall display extremely good performance for a variety of channels .",
    "quantum error - correcting codes on the other hand , under the guise of the css @xcite scheme , are in some ways strikingly similar to classical codes , and in particular can be decoded with purely classical means .",
    "it is therefore natural to try to import the classical ldpc know - how to the quantum setting .",
    "there is however a structural obstacle .",
    "a quantum css code is defined by two binary parity - check matrices whose row - spaces must be orthogonal to each other . to have a quantum ldpc code decodable by message - passing these two matrices should be sparse , as in the classical case .",
    "therefore , randomly choosing these matrices , the generic method which works very well in the classical case , is simply not an option in the quantum case , because the probability of finding two sparse row - orthogonal matrices is extremely small .",
    "a number of constructions have been suggested by classical coding theorists nevertheless @xcite but they do not produce families of quantum ldpc codes with a minimum distance growing with the blocklength . while this may be tolerable for practical constructions of fixed size , this is clearly an undesirable feature of any asymptotic construction and it raises the intriguing theoretical question of how large can the minimum distance of sparse ( or ldpc ) css codes be .",
    "families of sparse css codes with a growing minimum distance do exist , the most well - known of these being kitaev s toric code @xcite , which has been generalised to codes based on tesselations of surfaces ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) and higher - dimensional objects .",
    "these constructions exhibit minimum distances that scale at most as a square root of the blocklength @xmath5 ( to be precise , @xmath6 is achieved in @xcite ) though this often comes at the cost of a very low dimension ( recall that the dimension of the toric code is @xmath7 ) .",
    "it is an open question as to whether families of sparse css codes exist with a minimum distance that grows at least as @xmath8 for @xmath9 , even for quantum codes with dimension @xmath10 .",
    "the recent construction @xcite manages to reconcile a minimum distance of the order of @xmath11 with a dimension linear in the blocklength .",
    "all these constructions borrow ideas from topology and can be seen as some generalisation of kitaev s toric code .    in a follow - up to the paper @xcite mackay , mitchison and",
    "shokrollahi @xcite proposed a construction that seemingly owes very little to the topological approach .",
    "they noticed that the adjacency matrix of any cayley graph over @xmath12 with an even set of generators is self - dual and can therefore be used to define a sparse css code .",
    "experiments with some cayley graphs were encouraging . in the present work",
    "we take up the theoretical study of the parameters of these css codes which was left open by mackay _",
    "et al . _ the quantum code in the construction",
    "is defined by a classical @xmath13 $ ] linear binary code where @xmath14 must be even .",
    "its length is @xmath15 , and the row - weight of the parity - check matrix is @xmath14 .",
    "the dimension and the minimum distance of the quantum code does not depend solely on the classical code s parameters , but depend more subtly on its structure .",
    "we solve the problem in the first non - trivial case , which was an explicit question of mackay _ et al .",
    "_ , namely the case when the classical code is the @xmath3 $ ] repetition code .",
    "computing the parameters of the associated quantum code turns out to be not easy , even in this apparently simple case .",
    "our main result , theorem [ thm : main ] , gives the exact parameters for this quantum code , namely : @xmath16.\\ ] ] the construction therefore hits the @xmath11 barrier for the minimum distance , but it is quite noteworthy that it does so using a construction that breaks significantly with the topological connection . for quantum codes based on more complicated classical @xmath13 $ ] structures ,",
    "similarly precise results seem quite difficult to obtain , but we managed to prove a lower bound on the quantum minimum distance of the form @xmath17 for some constant @xmath18 ( theorem [ thm : min_dist ] ) .",
    "notice that the constructed quantum ldpc codes have not a constant row - weight .",
    "indeed , this weight is logarithmic in the blocklength .",
    "this has its drawbacks since decoding will be slightly more complex , we remark however that the best families of classical ldpc codes ( i.e. capacity - achieving ldpc codes ) all have row weights that grow logarithmically in the block length .",
    "we note also that it was recently proved in  @xcite that quantum ldpc stabilizer codes can not achieve the capacity of the quantum erasure channel if their stabilizer matrices have constant row weight .",
