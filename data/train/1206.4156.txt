    "nevertheless , such a complementary approach has already enjoyed some successes . local positional correlation in a disordered material has been shown to lead to resonant scattering events generating extended states at isolated energies in the spectrum.@xcite with much longer - ranged correlated disorder , even in one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems , effective metal - insulator transitions can be induced .",

    "our approach uses a simple product structure for the random potential which , except for certain resonance conditions , leads to anisotropically localized states .",
    "we believe our results to be of particular relevance for ultracold atoms or bose - einstein condensates in optical lattices as these are ideal for studying disorder effects.@xcite in fact , very recently the first direct observations of localization of matter waves in 3d disordered optical potentials have been reported .",
    "@xcite here , by engineering the underlying disorder , our study shows how extended matter waves emerge from a background of localized states ( cp .",
