    "yut - nori with nori meaning a game , is a korean traditional board game .",
    "each team is given four pieces , usually small stones , called mal , and teams share four sticks called yut and the game board called yut - pan to play .",
    "the set of four sticks acts like a dice ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : yut ] ) : each wooden stick has the shape of a cylinder half - cut in a longitudinal direction and has the back side ( the round side ) and the belly side ( the flat side ) . the number of belly sides of four thrown sticks determines the number of steps that a piece on the board can move . if only one stick shows the belly side and others back sides , we call this do .",
    "when one gets do , the team can advance its piece by one step on the game board .",
    "likewise , gae and geol are for two and three sticks of belly sides , and the piece proceeds by two and three steps , respectively .",
    "if all four sticks show belly sides , which is called yut ( the same term yut is used both for the outcome of stick throwing and for the name of sticks ) , the team s piece is advanced by four steps , whereas for four back sided sticks ( no belly sided stick ) called mo , the piece moves by five steps on the game board .",
    "yut sticks are cut in such a way that the probability @xmath0 for the belly side is larger than the probability @xmath1 for the back side . for a given value of @xmath0 ,",
    "it is straightforward to compute the probabilities for do , gae , geol , yut , and mo as @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pn ] , we display the above probabilities as functions of @xmath0 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath0 must be larger than 0.5 to have @xmath7 for example .",
    "also , if @xmath8 , @xmath9 becomes larger than @xmath10 , which needs to be avoided since yut is much better than do and thus should occur less frequently than do .",
    "consequently , we expect that the probability @xmath0 for the belly side must satisfy @xmath11 .    .",
    "( c ) four yut sticks can have five different states , depending on the number of belly sides : do , gae , geol , and yut for one to four belly sides , respectively .",
    "mo is when all four yut - sticks are of the back sides . ,",
    "scaledwidth=47.0% ]     for the belly side of one yut stick .",
    "mo is the most favorable in yut - nori since you can proceed five steps and you are given one more chance to throw sticks .",
    "yut is the second best , giving you four steps on the board and one more chance to throw .",
    "traditionally , @xmath0 is set to close to 0.6 , which is easily understood since @xmath12 when @xmath13 .",
    ", scaledwidth=48.0% ]    there still remains a debate about the historical origin of yut - nori , but the argument by chae - ho shin , who was a korean historian and independence movement activist during japan s colonization period of korea , has been widely accepted  @xcite . according to him ,",
    "yut - nori originated from an ancient korean kingdom gojoseon , which existed from 2333 bc according to the history book samguk yusa written by a buddhist monk ilyeon in the 13th century ad .",
    "in gojoseon era , there were five influential tribes ruling five regions in the kingdom , and they joined forces during wartime .",
    "the game board yut - pan mimics how these five tribes spatially arranged their positions during battles . except for the king s tribe , all four tribes had their names from livestock ; pigs , dogs , cows , and horses . these names are reflected as the terms in yut - nori as do , gae , yut , and mo , respectively .",
    "chae - ho shin argues that the king s tribe is represented as geol in yut - nori .",
    "it is interesting to note that the distance a piece can move appears to correspond to the sizes and the step widths of animals .",
    "the speed of a pig is the smallest and a horse the fastest , giving the increasing step size in yut - nori . even in modern korean language , a dog is still called gae , and a pig doe - ji , probably sharing the same origin as do in yut - nori .",
    "pieces move along the sites marked on the board counterclockwise , starting from the bottom right corner .",
    "allowed sites are drawn as circles , and there are three forks , two upper corners and center [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : yutpan](a ) ] .",
    "there are four possible ways to return to the starting point to make a round trip ; the shortest path , two middle distance paths , and the longest path as shown in fig .  [ fig : yutpan](a ) . rules of the game are almost common across the whole country with a small variation for different regions .",
    "each team , one by one in turn , rolls the sticks and moves pieces on the board .",
    "the team , whose all pieces make round trips around the board returning to the starting point , is the winner .",
    "if other team s pieces are at the site of the stick - rolling team s piece , other team s pieces are caught and the team is asked to roll sticks one more time .",
    "we call this situation as _ catching _ in the present paper",
    ". yut and mo have less chance to occur in comparison with do , gae , and geol ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pn ] ) and when the team has either yut or mo , the team is given another chance to throw sticks .",
    "consequently , one team often can throw sticks several times in one turn .",
    "suppose that a team gets yut , and thus the team throws sticks once more to get mo , which gives the team geol in next rolling .",
    "if the last geol catches the opponent piece(s ) , the team can throw once more .",
    "consequently , there can occur a variety of different situations even in a single turn , and it is possible in principle that one team can win the game in its first turn although present authors have not seen this in their entire lives .",
    "if the same team s pieces meet at the same site on the board , they can pile up ( we call this _ piling _ ) . piled up",
    "pieces can move together afterwards so that piling reduces the number of turns that is needed to win . on the other hand",
    ", piling can be risky , since if piled pieces are caught by an opponent team , all pieces should start the game again from the starting position . accordingly , catching is a more aggressive strategy in yut - nori , but piling is also a good strategy in some situation in which the chance of being caught is slim .",
    "the original two - dimensional game board [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : yutpan](a ) ] is too complicated to analyze . only for the sake of simplicity , we consider only the longest path in the game board , which allows us to analyze the one - dimensional board displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : yutpan](b ) .",
    "the advantage of using the one - dimensional board lies on the fact that we do not need to choose which path to take among the four possibilities in fig .",
    "[ fig : yutpan](a ) . within the limitation ,",
    "we believe that our game theoretic approach described below can give us some clue to answer the question which strategy between piling and catching yields bigger winning rate .",
    "the remaining part of the present paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec:1d ] , we first consider the case in which one player with one piece throws yut sticks . we perform a simple statistical analysis of our simplified one - dimensional yut - nori to compute the average step size and the distribution of number of turns to finish the game . our main result for the winning strategy is reported in sec .  [",
    "sec : winning ] , and the avalanche - size distribution in the infinitely long one - dimensional board is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : avalanche ] , which is followed by summary in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "we first consider the simplest case that one player plays the game alone with only one piece in one - dimensional yut - pan [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : yutpan](b ) ] .",
    "we can ask how long distance the piece advances in one turn on average .",
    "let us denote this expectation value of the distance as @xmath14 .",
    "since the player can throw yut sticks once more if she has yut or mo , @xmath14 satisfies the following self - consistent equation @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the probability for the step size @xmath17 , e.g. , @xmath18 for geol and @xmath19 for mo , respectively , and we get @xmath20 when @xmath21 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pn ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi ] ) yields @xmath22 , which we confirm through numerical simulation : from @xmath23 runs , the average value is found to be @xmath24 .    during numerical experiment",
    "repeated @xmath23 times , we also measure how many turns needs to be spent to finish the game and call it @xmath25 .",
    "the distribution function @xmath26 is very well approximated by the gaussian form as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gauss ] . among",
    "the @xmath23 runs , we find @xmath27 occurs only about 100 times . likewise , in playing the original yut - nori with the game board in fig .",
    "[ fig : yutpan](a ) , it is almost impossible to see the starting team win the game without ever giving its turn to other teams .",
    "versus @xmath25 ( the number of turns to finish the game ) calculated from @xmath23 independent runs ( filled circles ) .",
    "the full - drawn curve is the outcome from the least - square fit to the gaussian form with the mean 7.59 and the standard deviation 1.77.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "although more than two teams can play yut - nori , two - team play appears to be most popular . in every round",
    ", each team throws sticks in turn , and the player who actually throws sticks is chosen sequentially : suppose that two teams @xmath28 and @xmath29 have players @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "in the first round @xmath32 and @xmath33 throw sticks , and in the second round @xmath34 and @xmath35 play , and so on . in our setting , the number of players in each team is not important if all players in the team use the same strategy . to further simplify the game",
    ", we assume that two teams use only two pieces each ( instead of four as in the original yut - nori ) and play the game in the one - dimensional board in fig .",
    "[ fig : yutpan](b ) . even in this simple",
    "setting a variety of different situations can arise .",
    "team s strategy is crucial to win the game since there are different ways to move pieces on the board even in the same situation .",
    "a team can be aggressive and tries to catch the opponent s pieces whenever possible . otherwise , it can pile up their pieces to speed up the movement of pieces afterwards .",
    "our simplified game proceeds as follows : a team throws yut sticks . depending on the outcome ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : yut ] ) , the number @xmath17 of steps the team s piece can advance is decided . for given @xmath17 ,",
    "the team can decide what to do for the current configuration of the game board .",
    "if the piece of the opponent can be caught for given @xmath17 we denote this situation as @xmath36 , while we denote @xmath37 if the team can pile up their two pieces together .",
    "if neither catching nor piling is possible , we denote this as @xmath38. since each team has two pieces , the team s strategy must decide what to do for all possible cases @xmath39 with @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the situation for the first ( second ) piece .",
    "for example , @xmath42 means that the team s first piece can catch the opponent s piece and the team s second piece can pile up with its first piece .",
    "we denote the decision made by a given strategy as @xmath43 . if the strategy @xmath44 decides to move the 1st piece , @xmath45 , while @xmath46 if the 2nd piece is decided to be moved .",
    "for example @xmath47 means that the strategy @xmath44 chooses to catch by using the first piece , while @xmath48 means that the 2nd piece will be moved to pile up with the 1st piece . among all @xmath49 possible combinations for @xmath50 ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath51 is impossible since only one piece that is behind the other piece can pile up . among remaining 8 cases ,",
    "@xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 are easy to handle : we naturally assume that teams always favor @xmath37 and @xmath36 over @xmath38 , giving us @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , irrespective of given strategy . for @xmath60",
    ", it is always better to catch the opponent s piece that is located close to the destination and thus @xmath61 or @xmath62 depending on the locations of opponent s pieces . from the above consideration",
    ", the only cases to be taken carefully are @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 . among these three",
    ", @xmath65 is not related with the choice between catching and piling , and thus we fix the strategy outcome for this : we move the piece which has bigger chance to be caught by the opponent team .",
    "suppose that the distance to the opponent team s piece behind is @xmath66 .",
    "we put the highest priority for the piece if @xmath67 or @xmath68 , and the second highest priority for @xmath69 , and then for @xmath70 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pn ] ) .",
    "if @xmath71 , we move the piece that is behind of the other piece .    in the present work , we aim to find which strategy between catching and piling gives bigger chance to win , and thus consider two different strategies denoted by @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the former prefers catching to piling , and the latter piling to catching .",
    "accordingly , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , whereas @xmath76 and @xmath77 . we also need to consider the effect of who starts first , which makes us consider all four different combinations of competition : @xmath78 = [ s_c , s_c ] , [ s_c , s_p ] , [ s_p , s_c ] , [ s_p , s_p]$ ] , where @xmath79 is the strategy chosen by the first ( the second ) team .",
    "we calculate the wining rate of the first team from @xmath80 independent runs , and report the result in table  [ tab : win ] .",
    "we find that if the 2nd team s strategy is @xmath72 , the 1st team is better off if @xmath72 is used ( the top left corner of table  [ tab : win ] ) .",
    "if the 2nd team is using @xmath73 instead , the 1st team again has a higher winning rate for @xmath72 .",
    "we thus conclude that @xmath72 always gives better chance to win regardless of the opponent s strategy .",
    "other seemingly interesting finding one can draw from table  [ tab : win ] is that always the first team has bigger chance to win . in other words ,",
    "being the first team to throw yut sticks is more important than the strategy choice , within the limitation of simplification made in the present work .    for more detailed understanding of the dominance of @xmath72 ,",
    "let us compare advantages of two strategies , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , in terms of dominance .",
    "we define dominance of one team , say @xmath28 , against the other team , say @xmath29 , as @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 denote positions of two pieces of each team .",
    "if the number of steps given to the team @xmath28 is @xmath17 and the team @xmath28 s situation is @xmath63 , the corresponding configuration must be such that @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( suppose that the 1st piece of @xmath29 can be caught ) . in case",
    "when the team @xmath28 s strategy is @xmath72 , the piece at @xmath86 catches the piece at @xmath87 so that the expected increment of @xmath88 is written as @xmath89 . here",
    "@xmath14 is added due to the fact that the team @xmath28 is given one more chance to throw sticks . if the team @xmath28 uses the strategy @xmath73 , then the piece at @xmath90 will be piled on the top of the piece at @xmath86 .",
    "piling itself does not contribute to the increment of @xmath88 at this turn .",
    "instead , the team @xmath28 will benefit from the piling at later turns unless they are caught by the piece of team @xmath29 behind them .",
    "thus , we get @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the expected number of free movement of the piled piece . the condition for the dominance of @xmath72 , i.e. @xmath93 , reads @xmath94 .",
    "this inequality holds only for sufficiently large @xmath86 because larger @xmath86 leads to both larger @xmath95 , which is @xmath96 , and smaller @xmath92 .",
    "precisely , the expectation of @xmath17 is @xmath14 , and one gets @xmath97 if the team @xmath28 is not interrupted by the team @xmath29 after piling , resulting in the condition as @xmath98 for @xmath99 . despite of the oversimplification , our argument gives a hint for understanding the results .    to conclude the present section , in the present numerical experiment of strategy competition , an aggressive team who starts the game",
    "first has a higher chance to win .    .winning rates for the 1st team for different pairs of competing strategies .",
    "@xmath72 prefers catching the opponent s piece to piling up pieces , while @xmath73 s preference is opposite ( it favors piling over catching ) .",
    "if the 1st team uses @xmath72 , the 2nd @xmath73 , the 1st team wins the game at probability 0.51314(2 ) .",
    "it is found that you d better be the first team and that @xmath72 always gives higher winning rates than @xmath73 .",
    "we repeat @xmath80 runs to get the average winning rates .",
    "the numbers in parentheses are the errors in the last digits . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : win ]",
    "suppose that there are many pieces on the board .",
    "if the density of opponent team s pieces is very high , your piece can easily catch those pieces , giving you one more chance to throw yut sticks and thus to catch more .",
    "accordingly , one can expect that if the density of opponent team s pieces is high , the density will soon be reduced .",
    "on the other hand , if the density is low , it will gradually increase because most of pieces will survive .",
    "the above reasoning suggests a possibility that the board configuration can be self - organized to some state , which might be critical ( or not ) .",
    "we construct a simple model of the one - dimensional game with infinite number of teams and infinite number of sites .",
    "we restrict each team to have only one piece , and the piece can move only one ( at probability @xmath0 ) or two ( at probability @xmath1 ) steps . if the piece is decided to move two steps at probability @xmath1 , or if it catches other piece , the team has one more chance to move .",
    "this simplified model can be considered as yut - nori with one yut stick , with only do and mo .",
    "of course , differently from the original yut - nori , mo with no belly sided stick gives a team two steps , instead of five steps , in this simplified version of the game .",
    "of pieces on the board at time @xmath25 for @xmath100 .",
    "( b ) expansion of ( a ) showing abrupt drops of @xmath101 .",
    "the avalanche size @xmath102 is defined as the drop size whose distribution is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : aval ] . , scaledwidth=45.0% ]     of the avalanche size @xmath102 for the simplified yut - nori on infinitely long one - dimensional board .",
    "we assume that there is only one yut stick , and if the stick shows belly side up ( at probability @xmath0 ) the piece moves one step . otherwise , for the back side , the piece is moved two steps and the team is given one more chance to play , like mo in the original game .",
    "we also assume that each team is given one piece and the number of teams is not limited , which means that every piece on the board is put by a different team . for any value of the probability @xmath0 for the belly side",
    ", the avalanche - size distribution clearly follows an exponential form : @xmath103 with @xmath104 decreasing with @xmath0 . at @xmath105 , @xmath106 , as explained in the text .",
    "we also include the result ( triangles ) for the four stick game ( like the original yut - nori ) , which lies almost on top of curves for @xmath105 and @xmath100 . , scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "the number of pieces on the board varies in time .",
    "it first increases with fluctuation [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : density](a ) ] , and it sometimes decreases drastically [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : density](b ) ] .",
    "avalanche size @xmath102 is defined as the number of caught pieces removed from the board in one turn , and we display the avalanche - size distribution ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the a general discussion ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : aval ] .",
    "irrespective of @xmath0 , the avalanche - size distribution is shown to follow an exponential form @xmath103 with @xmath104 decreasing with @xmath0 .",
    "for @xmath105 , the process becomes trivially deterministic , which allows us to get @xmath107 analytically .",
    "the first player starts and put her piece at the first site .",
    "we represent the configuration of the board as `` @xmath108 '' ( the first site is the rightmost one ) , which we denote as binary digit 1 .",
    "likewise , after the second turn we get the board `` @xmath109 '' @xmath110 , and @xmath111 for the third turn , @xmath112 for the fourth turn , @xmath113 for the fifth turn , all in the binary format . in this binary notation ,",
    "the board configuration after the @xmath17th turn is written as a binary number which is simply @xmath17 in decimal format .",
    "consequently , in order to occupy all sites up to @xmath114th site , one needs @xmath115 turns since the next player at the @xmath116-th turn will have her piece at the @xmath117-th site removing all @xmath114 pieces on its way .",
    "in other words , the avalanche of the size @xmath118 occurs at time @xmath119 .",
    "avalanches that occur in the time interval @xmath120 $ ] are exactly identical to the avalanches in @xmath121 $ ] .",
    "it is interesting to see that the above process is similar to the game of hanoi towers , in which one is asked to move all disks to other pole within the constraint that a smaller disk must be put on a larger disk . for @xmath122 ,",
    "the largest avalanche was of the size @xmath123 and it occurred once .",
    "the second largest avalanche size was @xmath124 and it occurred twice , and the avalanche of the size @xmath125 occurred four times , and so on . consequently , the distribution of the avalanche sizes @xmath102 is written as @xmath126 in fig .",
    "[ fig : aval ] , it is seen that for @xmath127 , the avalanche - size distribution almost overlaps with @xmath128 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hanoi ] ) .",
    "we also present the avalanche - size distribution obtained for four yut - stick game like the original yut - nori in fig .",
    "[ fig : aval ] , which also exhibits exponential form and well described by @xmath128 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hanoi ] ) . in four yut - stick game ,",
    "yut and mo occur at probability about 0.15 in total , which presumably explains the agreement with the one stick game at @xmath129 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : aval ] , since yut and mo give players a chance to rethrow sticks .",
    "it has been well known that one - dimension abelian sandpile models do not show self - organized criticality  @xcite whereas the avalanche - size distribution of the non - abelian model follows a power law form  @xcite .",
    "our yut - nori model is close to the one - dimensional non - abelian model  @xcite .",
    "however , the avalanche - size distribution of our model does not follow the power law because dissipation of pieces can occur at any place in the board . in the presence of severe dissipation of pieces as in our model ,",
    "the average avalanche size was shown not to diverge and the distribution has a cutoff  @xcite , which explains the absence of the self - organized criticality in our model .",
    "one - dimensional version of the korean game of yut - nori has been investigated .",
    "it has been shown that the probability @xmath0 for one yut stick to show the flat belly side up must be close to 0.6 . when yut - nori is played , there can be two competing ways to decide how to move pieces on the game board yut - pan ; a team can either prefer piling , or catching . by performing numerical simulations of huge number of simplified virtual yut - nori games ,",
    "we have shown that the more aggressive strategy that favors catching yields a higher winning rate .",
    "it has been also found that the team who starts first has a higher chance to win .",
