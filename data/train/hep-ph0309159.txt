    "the search for new physics in high energy cosmic rays has intensified over the last few years @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "in fact , several experimental collaborations have provided interesting new data in this direction , even though , at the moment , there is not enough evidence to conclusively assess the presence ( or the exclusion ) of a greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( or gzk ) cutoff @xcite ( @xmath1 ev ) on the basis of these sets of data alone .",
    "it is widely expected that the presence of this cutoff in the - almost structureless - fast falling ( in energy ) inclusive cosmic ray spectrum is due to the interaction of the primary particles with the cosmic background radiation .",
    "the presence of a cutoff implies that the sources should be inside a sphere of approximately @xmath2 mpc ( gzk distance ) in radius .",
    "events above the cutoff ( also termed ultra high energy cosmic rays or uhecr ) , which have been repeatedly reported by several experimental collaborations in the last fourty years or so , if they are experimentally confirmed , should therefore point directly to their sources located within this radial gzk distance from our galaxy . since within this distance there is no homogeneity in the distribution of sources , if we assume a `` traditional '' or `` bottom - up '' mechanism of acceleration , such as fermi acceleration and variants thereof , we should detect clustering in the events .",
    "if clustering is not observed then we need to look for alternative ( non traditional ) explanations , with very interesting consequences .",
    "it has been thought for some time that new physics is involved in the explanation of the uhecr . from a theoretical perspective",
    ", the confirmation of the existence of a systematic violation of the cutoff can be considered as a possible signal of new physics .",
    "there are many interesting suggestions as for the nature of these events .",
    "one possibility is the well known z - burst mechanism ( see @xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) , based on the idea of a ultra high energy neutrino ( uhe ) hitting a relic anti - neutrino .",
    "the corresponding s - channel amplitude may resonate on the z gauge boson with a larger cross section .",
    "the typical energy of the primary protons generated by this mechanism is around the gzk cutoff and is fine - tuned by a neutrino mass which is in agreement with current estimated values .",
    "this suggestion evades the cutoff due to the weakly interacting nature of the primary ( a neutrino ) .",
    "we recall that the possibility of a direct interaction of neutrinos scattering off nucleons in the atmosphere is ruled out by the fact that such interaction should take place uniformly in the atmosphere , and it does nt .",
    "other , more radical suggestions call for a modification of fundamental physics @xcite . we should mention that several re - analysis of the data by the hires @xcite and the agasa @xcite collaborations also add up to the dispute about the very existence of the cutoff , while other proposals call for dark matter candidates ( see @xcite for a summary ) .",
    "there are various suggestions in this last direction and there is enough room , allowed both from cosmological constraints and particle physics constraints , to have viable particle candidates as origin of the uhecr flux without running into some narrow corners of parameter space .    it is expected that the auger observatory @xcite in argentina will be able to provide a definitive answer to this issues , while the construction of a separate ( auger north ) site is also under consideration .",
    "as we have mentioned , one of the possible solution to the problem of the origin of the uhecr events is obtained by assuming that the primary proton spectrum is generated by the decay of long - lived super - heavy states whose mass is in the @xmath3 gev range ( see @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "superstring theory can naturally account for the meta - stable states by a stabilization mechanism due to the breaking of the non - abelian gauge symmetries by wilson lines .",
    "the mechanism @xcite gives rise to states in the string spectrum which carry standard charge under the standard model , but fractional charge under an additional @xmath4 gauge group , which can be regarded as a rather generic consequence of string unification .    in this case",
    "the gzk cutoff is evaded assuming that these relics are distributed within gzk distance from us .",
    "the mass required for the meta - stable state , whose lifetime is between @xmath5 sec , is about @xmath6 gev , while their abundancy ( @xmath7 ) is constrained by the observed flux of the uhecr events .",
    "we remark that the spectrum of the primary hadrons / leptons generated by the decay can be calculated - in some approximation - using standard renormalization group tools ( in the vacuum ) @xcite , while their energy can be comparable with the gzk energy . on the basis of these results one can reasonably assess that long lived meta - stable particles can be candidates for the origin of uhecr events .",
    "the analysis of the structural properties of the shower after the impact of the primary cosmic ray with the atmosphere is the main objective in the work of the experimental collaborations and relies heavily on the use of complex monte carlo programs , such as corsika @xcite .",
    "usually , these monte carlo have , on the other hand , to rely on the performance of special event generators to simulate the first impact , which use data on inclusive cross sections and partial cross sections at lower energies extrapolated up to very high energies , around the cutoff . both a diffractive ( dominant ) and a non - diffractive component are usually included in these models , to which a minijet cross section is also added up .",
    "these routines are called up by the main program repeatedly , both for scattering and fragmentation . at a second stage , iterativly ,",
    "the main code simulates the development of the air shower along the atmosphere , going exhaustively through all the possible channels and tracking down the particles which have been generated at each interaction .",
    "the cascade evolves as a _ fat tree _ and is computationally very expensive . at the gzk cutoff one",
    "soon runs into memory problems and a direct simulation needs therefore special algorithms @xcite to render the analysis possible .    having said this , we come to illustrate other work in the formation of the fragmenting spectrum _ in the vacuum _ which also gives some indication on the multiplicity structure of the various channels open to the fragmenting primary .",
    "these attempts @xcite have been based on the use of standard renormalization group ( rg ) equations , incorporating at times the resummation of small - x effects , for instance using color coherence in the modified leading logarithmic approximation , in the study of the final spectrum of the heavy particle decaying .",
    "we remark that these second attempts usually neglect the role played by the passage of the primaries in the atmosphere in the determination of the final signal on the plane of the detector .",
    "in fact , the rearrangement of the spectrum of the final hadrons induced by the mixing of the anomalous dimensions in the rg evolution , as first suggested in @xcite , due -for instance- to supersymmetry , gives some indication on the presence of a new component , but should be folded with the ordinary atmospheric simulations in order to produce more reliable results @xcite .",
    "we simply do not have , at this time , any analysis which is , from this perspective , complete enough to be useful for the experiments and more work is needed in this direction .    in regard to the study of horizontal air showers , much less is known at a quantitative level , compared to air showers induced by primary hadrons , since the interaction of neutrinos with the atmosphere is not included in simulation programs such as corsika .",
    "we should mention that the column of air above the detector can act as a large calorimeter , thereby increasing the rate for neutrino interaction considerably .",
    "it is important though to remark that horizontal air showers are depleted of the electromagnetic component and have mostly a muon component which makes the shape of the cascade _ distinct _ from the hadron initiated shower .",
    "improvements along these lines will be very important in order to reconstruct these near - horizontal air showers .",
    "in ref . @xcite we have described some of the features of the cascade induced by cosmic rays ( protons ) , performing some large scale simulation of the shower formation both with a fixed and a variable first impact - at zero zenith - of the primary .",
    "the arrival direction is therefore perpendicular to the detector plane and the opening is measured with respect to this vertical axis .",
    "here we intend to describe some of the observables of the shower which may serve as a characterization of its structure .",
    "we start by showing some results obtained using the monte carlo air shower generator corsika .",
    "the simulations have been performed on a small cluster running @xmath8 for parallelization purposes and we have used the thinning option in the compiled code in order to make our results manageable . even with these simplifications ,",
    "the number of possible channels at the gzk energy generate total outputs around 1 terabyte of memory in size .",
    "1 illustrates a simulation of the multiplicites as a function of the various observation levels in the atmosphere .",
    "the impact of the primary has been assumed to take place almost at the beginning ( 113 km ) of the atmosphere and the developement of the multiplicities of the main components ( photons , electrons , muons and antiparticles ) has been tracked .",
    "unfortunately the statistical fluctuations in this results ( not shown in the figure , see @xcite ) are rather large and considering the rate at which auger will presumably collect uhecr events ( 30 to 100 per year ) , we will probably be able to confront the experimental data with simulation of this type only after few years of run ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "while fluctuations in the geometrical opening of the shower can be rather wide , those in the multiplicities are rather reduced @xcite .",
    "therefore , the study of the inclusive multiplicities of the various subcomponents of the air shower as a function of the energy or as a function of the height in the atmosphere are particularly interesting and deserve some comments .",
    "distributions such as those in fig .",
    "2 are a good characterization of the multiplicities of the subcomponents of the shower across the various observation levels in the atmosphere and contain important information useful for its reconstruction .",
    "3 , instead , shows that simulation models such as corsika , combined with hadronization models - in the first hadronic interaction - such as qgsjet @xcite predict linearly rising multiplicities ( with energy , in a log / log plot ) for the various components . in regard to this , it a has been shown in @xcite that the total multiplicities do not seem to be affected appreciably by the statistical fluctuations in the formation of the shower , and therefore they can be taken as a robust characterization both of the hadronization model and of the overall developement of the cascade .",
    "given the robustness of this result , a failure to reproduce experimentally this linear trend can be considered either as a serious fault of the models implemented so far or as a possible signal of new physics .",
    "an interesting possibility to take into consideration is the production of dark matter as a consequence of the first ( primary ) impact",
    ". this may be the case if supersymmetric channels open up at the large energy scale of the first collision of the primary , with a subsequent production of neutralinos or other weakly interacting dark matter candidates . if the underlying interaction favors channels with large missing energy , then the linear trend shown in fig .",
    "2 can be affected .",
    "given the fact that new interactions are likely to open up at a higher energy , the experimental calibration ( the slopes and intercepts ) could be done at a lower energy , say below the cutoff , and deviations from this linear behaviour measured above it .",
    "notice that these measurements are properties of a single shower and as such are not affected by the variations of the flux or of all the other parameters characterizing the inclusive high energy cosmic rays spectrum .",
    "only the particle type of the primary is supposed to be held fixed ( a proton , in this case ) .",
    "one of the issues that need to be addressed is how to characterize the shower in such a way that a reduced measured multiplicity of an event , due to missing energy , is not interpreted as an event of lower energy . to avoid this",
    ", we think that one needs a combined study of the geometry of the modified shower and of the lateral distributions .",
    "if the missing energy takes place mostly at the beginning of the shower , this might be possible , since the geometry of the upper part of the shower could be affected . the use of fluorescence detectors may be able to reconstruct this anomaly . instead",
    ", for a uniform multiplicity loss along the entire atmosphere the shower of reduced multiplicity is unlikely to be correctly identified as such and will probably be confused for an event of lower energy .",
    "however , as the original energy , available at the first impact , degrades due to scattering and fragmentation , there should be a height at which the shower shows an anomaly , since supersymmetric channels are not available any longer .",
    "searches for the origin of the uhecr will span probably a decade , but auger is already collecting data as the detector tanks are deployed on the site .",
    "it will be crucial , in order to confront theory with experiment , to have improved models of the hadronic interaction , which may also include possible extensions of the standard model in the monte carlo reconstruction of the topology and multiplicity of the event .",
    "we have pointed out that the issue of missing multiplicities could be relevant to identify new physics .",
    "large missing energy events ( probably around 20 % ) may have a chance to be identified , with important implications .",
    "we thank alon faraggi for collaborating to this analysis and to j. knapp for very informative discussions about auger while completing this work .",
    "we also thank infn for supporting the building of a small cluster at the univ .",
    "of lecce dedicated to these studies .",
