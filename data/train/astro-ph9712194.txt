    "the study of the physics of accretion onto compact objects ( neutron stars and black holes ) involves length scales much too small to be resolved by the current or the forseable future technology . as such , this study is conducted mainly by the theoretical interpretation of spectral and temporal observations of these systems . in this respect ,",
    "spectral analysis presents the first line of attack in unfolding their physical properties . for the specific systems and",
    "in particular black hole candidate ( bhc ) sources , a multitude of observations have indicated that their energy spectra can be fitted very well by comptonization of soft photons by hot electrons .",
    "it is thus generally agreed that comptonization is the process by which the high energy ( @xmath1 kev ) spectra of these sources are formed .",
    "thus , while the issue of the detailed dynamics of accretion onto the compact object is still not resolved , the assumption of the presence of a thermal distribution of hot electrons has proven sufficient to produce models which successfully fit the spectra of the emerging high energy radiation .",
    "spectral fitting , has been hence used as a probe of the dynamics of accretion onto the compact object .",
    "however , the comptonization spectra , which depend roughly on the product of the electron temperature and the photon escape probability from the scattering cloud , do not provide in and of themselves a measure of the scale of the system .",
    "as such they can not provide any clues about the dynamics of accretion of the hot gas onto the compact object , let alone its parameters ( density , velocity ) as a function of radius , necessary to determine these dynamics .",
    "one needs , in addition , time variability information .",
    "while simple minded dynamics anticipate most of the variability power to be associated with the dynamical time scales of the last few gravitational radii ( msec for galactic sources ) , the observed psd indicate that the variability power resides at time scales @xmath2 sec , far removed from the  natural \" ones . at the same time , however , the observed light curves do exhibit the presence of  flares \" with the expected ( a few msec ) rise times ( see e.g. @xcite ) , even though the latter make an insignificant contribution to the psd .",
    "it is therefore thought that the observed psds are due to a modulation of the accretion rate onto the compact object , the result of a kind of self - organized - criticality for the dynamics of accretion @xcite .",
    "however , the comptonization process , provides a much more refined probe of variability than the psd : because , on the average , the energy of the escaping photons increases with their residence time in the scattering medium , the hard photon light curves lag with respect to those of softer photons by amounts which depend on the photon scattering time .",
    "therefore , if the high energy radiation is emitted from a compact region near the black hole , the resulting lags @xmath3 should be independent of the fourier components of the time variation and @xmath4 msec .    these lags were sought for and fourier analyzed in the light curves of cyg x-1 , the x - ray transient source j0422 + 32 @xcite and the galactic source grs 1758 - 258 @xcite .",
    "surprizingly , rather than being constant ( @xmath5 msec ) , as expected , their magnitude was found to increase linearly with the fourier period @xmath6 , from @xmath70.001 sec at @xmath8 sec to roughly @xmath9 sec for @xmath10 sec .",
    "their magnitude and in particular their @xmath6-dependence , exclude the possibility that the observed psd are due to modulation of the accretion rate and strongly indicate scattering in a very extended non - uniform medium , whose density profile reflects on the functional dependence of the lags on @xmath6 as suggested by .",
    "as suggested originally in @xcite and discussed in more detail in , the issue of time lags can be resolved if the comptonization takes place in a very extended ( @xmath11 cm ) non - uniform hot plasma with density profile @xmath12 , the range in @xmath6 reflecting the range in radius over which this configuration extends .",
    "it was further discussed there that the dependence of lags on @xmath6 relates to the value of the index @xmath13 and it can be used to probe the density structure of the high energy emitting region .",
    "herein we discuss and present models on the x - ray light curves associated with this specific model of high energy emission from accreting compact objects .",
    "the fundamental tenet of our model is that the observed variability is due largely to the stochastic nature of compton scattering . as discussed in @xcite , the response of the extended atmosphere to a @xmath14-function injection of soft photons in its center ,",
    "has a power law ( rather than exponential as is the case for a uniform medium ) time dependence . our model light curves consist of an incoherent sum of such responses , the result of random injection of soft photons at given rate determined by the dynamics of the smallest radii , i.e. @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the response function of the atmosphere , @xmath17 are the arrival times of the individual shots and @xmath18 their amplitudes . to avoid introducing information in the distribution of @xmath18 s and @xmath17 s",
    "we assume that the @xmath18 s are constant while the @xmath17 s are randomly distributed about a mean value .",
    "to perform the sum of eq.(1 ) we produce an analytic fit to the function @xmath16 whose form has been computed using the monte - carlo code developed by one of us ( xmh ) .",
    "the form used in fitting them is the following : @xmath19    the model and computed response functions are given in fig .",
    "the values of the parameters corresponding to the specific figure are @xmath20 sec , and @xmath21 .",
    "the agreement between them is excellent .",
    "the psd of the light curve of fig .",
    "2 , computed using eq .",
    "( 1 ) , due to the independence of the shots , is simply the psd of an individual shot , also shown in fig .",
    "this psd , besides the segment @xmath22 , reflecting the @xmath23 part of @xmath16 , exhibits also a flattening at @xmath24 and a cut - off at @xmath25 hz , due respectively to the cut - off and rising parts of the shot .    in figure 2 we present a light curve given by the above prescription .",
    "the corrsponding values of the shot parameters are @xmath26 , and @xmath27 sec .",
    "the initial rising segment lasts @xmath28 sec , i.e. the cut - off time of the @xmath16 function and it is only a turn - on transient .",
    "eye inspection reveals the presence of shots with a broad range of rising times and durations , down to @xmath29 , and as long as a few seconds , even though only a single type of shot has been used in the model .",
    "these shots of varying duration are simply the result of the random sum of shots with power - law tails .",
    "one should note that the specific form of @xmath16 can not be discerned in their random superposition and one might naively consider the light curve as a sum of exponential shots with a distribution of timescales .",
    "however , the power law structure of the underlying shots is apparent in the psd of the light curves . at the same time",
    ", the fact that the time lags , as computed within this simple model , fit the observations in such straigtforward fashion , argues strongly in support of the above interpretation ."
