    "it is well known that in four - dimensional gauge theories the anomalous dimensions of composite operators with large lorentz spin @xmath1 scales logarithmically with the spin@xcite . in @xcite , this logarithmic scaling at strong coupling in @xmath2 sym",
    "was shown by using ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "they consider a folded string rotating in @xmath3 which is claimed to be dual to an operator of twist two with large spin in the gauge theory .",
    "the classical energy @xmath4 of the string ( scaling dimension of the operator ) scales at large spin as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the t hooft coupling .",
    "this analysis is extended to the operator with large @xmath7-charge @xmath8 as well as @xmath1 , in the form of @xmath9 ( here @xmath10 is the covariant derivative and @xmath11 is a complex scalar ) which corresponds to a folded string rotating in both @xmath3 and @xmath12 in @xcite . in the `` long string limit , '' @xmath13 the classical energy of the string can be written in a closed form @xcite . @xmath14",
    "these operators belong to the @xmath15 sector in the gauge theory .",
    "spectrum of such `` long '' operators can be analyzed using integrability of planar @xmath2 sym @xcite .",
    "partial list of the recent development includes @xcite .",
    "we want to consider what happens when this macroscopic string is replaced by a d - brane@xcite .",
    "there are several studies on this problem with wilson lines in ads / cft @xcite which originally correspond to macroscopic fundamental strings .",
    "when the macroscopic string is replaced by a d - brane with electric flux@xcite , it corresponds to a wilson line of a higher representation ; a d3-brane corresponds to the @xmath16-th symmetric representation while a d5-brane corresponds to the @xmath16-th anti - symmetric representation , where @xmath16 is the string charge of the d - brane with electric flux .",
    "thus , replacing the folded rotating string by a folded rotating d3 or d5-brane , one could analyze the spectrum of the local operators in the @xmath16-th symmetric or anti - symmetric representation . in the fundamental representation",
    "is replaced by the character ( or schur polynomial ) of the symmetric or the anti - symmetric representation . ]",
    "the spectrum of twist two operators in the @xmath16-th anti - symmetric representation is studied by armoni @xcite using rotating d5-brane .",
    "another related study is `` fat magnon''@xcite which is a d3-brane version of the macroscopic string solution called `` giant magnon''@xcite .",
    "other related solutions are found in @xcite .    in this paper",

    "there exists a critical value for @xmath21 for each @xmath20 above which the classical d3-brane solution does not exist ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this seems to be a similar phenomenon as the phase transition in a symmetric wilson loop observed in @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting further work to check this phase transition in the gauge theory side .    in order to calculate this anomalous dimension in the gauge theory side",
