    "in the standard model and the lowest order of perturbation the elastic electron meson scattering is the result of one photon exchange between the electron and one of the quarks in the meson .",
    "formally the hadronic matrix element entering the expression of the scattering amplitude is parametrized in a model independent lorentz covariant way as : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the elementary electromagnetic current expressed in terms of free quark fields , @xmath9 is the time evolution operator of the system due to quantum fluctuations of the colour field and @xmath10 is a space - like momentum transfer .",
    "all the information concerning the quark structure of the meson and the effects of the quantum fluctuations of the coloured field is contained in the electromagnetic form factor @xmath11 .",
    "this makes the calculation of the electromagnetic form factor a rather complicate problem .    as shown in a careful analysis @xcite , perturbative qcd calculations",
    "solely can not explain the observed pion and nucleon form factors at presently accessible values of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the dominant contribution seems to come from the hadronic wave functions which are essentially nonperturbative .",
    "in fact this was to be expected from the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics .",
    "point - like quarks and a real local interaction between them could be observed only asymptotically . at low momentum transfer only dressed quarks , the so - called constituent quarks , are observable .",
    "moreover , the electromagnetic current expressed in terms of constituent quark fields is only approximately local and the binding may also induce sizable effects .    in the present paper",
    "we calculate the form factors at low momentum transfer , where mesons exhibit a stable , time invariant structure in terms of constituent quarks .",
    "we assume that , to a good extent , the electromagnetic current expressed as a product of constituent quark fields may be considered local .",
    "consequently the matrix element ( [ def ] ) will be related to the overlap integral between the wave function of the final meson and that of the initial meson where one of the quarks has been replaced by the quark interacting with the electromagnetic field .",
    "we therefore consider that the space - like form factor indicates to what extent the initial system , where one of the quarks has been replaced by the recoiling quark , represents the final meson .",
    "similar significance can be assigned also to the semileptonic form factors .    in this framework , at low space - like @xmath0 the form factor @xmath11 is the effect of a stable meson structure @xcite and one would expect it to decrease continuously with @xmath12 because the larger is the momentum transfer , the less probable is to find the recoiling quark in the final meson .",
    "the decrease is then nothing else but the consequence of the worse and worse matching of the initial with final wave functions .",
    "then the calculation of the form factors at low momentum transfer amounts in finding a lorentz covariant internal wave function for the meson as a bound system made out of independent constituents .",
    "one of the best known solution to this problem is the bethe salpeter wave function .",
    "completed with the expression of the dressed quark - photon vertex satisfying the dyson - schwinger equation it led to remarkable results for low energy observables @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it must be noticed however that the formalism has ambiguities related to the definition of the relative quark momentum and that the presence of negative energy states in the quark propagators violates the real quark content of mesons . also , in order to satisfy the usual normalization condition of the form factor additional assumptions seem to be necessary @xcite , @xcite .",
    "quark models also used solutions of the schrdinger equation with suitably chosen potential terms .",
    "the calculations have been performed at @xmath13 and the decrease with @xmath12 has been introduced from phenomenological reasons @xcite .",
    "results independent of the specific form of the confining potential have been obtained in the light - front approach @xcite where the potential is formally included into the free mass term of the quark - antiquark system .",
    "the form factors can be calculated at any @xmath0 , but manifest lorentz covariance is lost because of the difference between `` good '' and `` bad '' components of the current .    in this paper we present an original way to take into account the confinement @xcite .",
    "the specific assumption of the model is that at low energy the hadrons look like stable systems made of valence quarks _ and _ of an effective vacuum - like field @xmath14 representing countless excitations of the quark - gluonic field which can not be observed one by one .",
    "the sum of all their momenta is the 4-momentum of the field @xmath14 which is supposed to be the relativistic generalization of the potential energy of the quark system .    the main reason for introducing this effective description is suggested by the exemples taken from relativistic field theory , where a bound state is the result of an infinite series of elementary interactions , but not the instantaneous effect of an elementary process @xcite .",
    "we therefore conjecture that the binding forces are the result of a time average of elementary processes which can not be seen one by one if the time of observation is rather long ( i.e. if the momentum transfer from the projectile to the target is rather low ) .",
    "we consider that the countless elementary excitations continuously taking place in a bound system deserve an average description in terms of an effective field @xmath14 , not an individual , perturbative treatment .",
    "furthermore , the presence besides the valence quarks of an effective field @xmath14 whose 4-momentum does not satisfy any mass constraint may also be useful for ensuring a definite mass to the compound system . indeed ,",
    "as it is well known , a system made of on - mass - shell particles having a continuous distribution of relative momenta does not behave like a single particle because it does not have a definite mass @xcite .",
    "an effective field may improve the situation by playing the role of a potential whose contribution adds to the quark kinetic energy yielding a definite value for the meson mass .",
    "the main features of the model are presented in the next section .",
    "we give the generic form of the meson state and calculate the expression of the electromagnetic form factor by using the canonical formalism of field theory .",
    "the third section contains the numerical results obtained with frozen transverse degrees of freedom .    in the last section",
    "we draw some conclusions concerning the applicability of the model and comment on the values of the parameters yielding the best fit .",
    "the main feature of the model is to suggest the generic wave function of the bound quark system representing the meson .",
    "a first requirement for the wave function is to be a lorentz covariant function of the independent quark coordinates because the quarks really behave like independent particles in the interaction with the electromagnetic field .",
    "it is obvious that in order to satisfy this requirement without introducing unphysical coordinates it is necessary to work in momentum space .",
    "this will also help expressing easily the mass shell constraints and the conservation laws .",
    "for this reason the internal wave function of the meson will be given under the form of the distribution function of the internal momenta .",
    "another constraint for the meson wave function follows from the requirement to satisfy a single particle normalization condition .",
    "accordingly , the integral over the internal momenta must converge , the relative momentum cut - off being provided by the internal distribution function of the quark momenta .",
    "recalling our conjecture that the binding potential can be described with the aid of an effective field we assume that the generic form of a single meson state is @xcite :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 are the creation operators of the valence @xmath17 pair ; @xmath18 are dirac spinors and @xmath19 is a dirac matrix ensuring the relativistic coupling of the quark spins . in the case of pseudoscalar mesons @xmath20 .",
    "the quark creation and annihilation operators satisfy canonical commutation relations and commute with @xmath21 , which represents the mean result of the elementary quark - gluon excitations responsible for the binding .",
    "their total momentum @xmath22 is not subject to any mass shell constraint and , in some sense , it is just what one needs to be added to the quark momenta in order to obtain the real meson momentum .",
    "this is in agreement with our assumption that @xmath23 is the relativistic generalization of the potential energy but we shall avoid for a while making any definite assumptions about the momentum carried by the effective field .    the internal function of the meson is the lorentz invariant momentum distribution function @xmath24 which is supposed to be time independent , because it describes an equilibrium situation .",
    "this means that it does not change under the action of internal strong forces and hence the time evolution operators @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ def ] ) can be replaced by unity . as mentioned above ,",
    "the main rle of @xmath25 is to ensure the single particle behaviour of the whole system , by cutting off the large relative momenta .    in the evaluation of the matrix element ( [ def ] )",
    "we shall use the cannonical commutation relations of the quark operators    @xmath26    and the expression of the vacuum expectation value of the effective field which is defined as follows @xcite :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the meson volume and @xmath29 is the characteristic time involved in the definition of the mean field @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath29 is the time needed by the bound state to be formed and hence we expect it to be of the order of the hadronization time .    it is important to remark that the definition ( [ vev ] ) is compatible with the norm of the vacuum state if one takes @xmath30 .",
    "we notice also that the relation ( [ vev ] ) has the character of a conservation law , just like the commutation relations ( [ cr ] ) , both of them being necessary for the fullfilement of the overall energy momentum conservation in the process .    as a first test of the model",
    "we evaluate the norm of the single meson state ( [ meson ] ) according to the usual procedure .",
    "the exponent in the integral @xmath31 coming from the @xmath32 functions in eqs .",
    "( [ meson ] ) and ( [ vev ] ) shall be put equal to 0 and the integral equal to @xmath33 , because the uncertainty in the meson mass is expected to be much smaller than @xmath34 .    observing that @xmath33 is the characteristic time involved in the definition of the effective field @xmath14 in the case of a moving meson , we write it as @xmath35 and get :    @xmath36    where @xmath37    this a remarkable result because it shows that the wave function of the many particle system representing the meson can be normalized like that of a single particle if the integral @xmath38 converges .    as a matter of consistency",
    ", we also remark the disappearance of the rather arbitrary time constant @xmath29 from the expression ( [ norm ] ) of the norm .",
    "we evaluate now the matrix element ( [ def ] ) proceeding in the same manner as before .",
    "the expression of the electromagnetic current written in terms of free quark fields is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the fraction of the proton charge carried by the quark @xmath41 . introducing ( [ jem ] ) between the meson states ( [ meson ] ) and using the relations ( [ vev ] ) and ( [ cr ] ) to eliminate some integrals over the internal momenta we obtain after a straightforward calculation : @xmath42 where @xmath43\\\\ t_\\mu^{(2)}&=&\\kappa_2~\\delta^{(4)}(p+k+q - p')~\\varphi_f^{(2)}(p , k;q ) ~tr\\left[\\gamma_5(-\\hat k+m_2)\\gamma_\\mu(-\\hat q+m_2 ) \\gamma_5(\\hat p+m_1)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the two terms in ( [ tmu ] ) represent the contributions of the valence quarks , @xmath44 is the momentum of the recoiling quark , @xmath45 is the final meson momentum and @xmath46 are the momentum distribution functions of the initial and final mesons respectively .    in the following",
    "we shall work in the breit frame where the momenta of the initial and final mesons are @xmath47 and @xmath48 and the electromagnetic form factor reads as :    @xmath49    in this frame it is an easy matter to show that @xmath50=1 in the case of a charged meson .",
    "the demonstration makes use of @xmath51 to eliminate the integrals over @xmath52 in @xmath53 and of the identity @xmath54 to reduce the number of projectors . performing a similar operation on @xmath55 and proceeding like in the case of the norm",
    ", one gets @xmath56 which means @xmath57 if the meson wave function is properly normalized .    in order to calculate the form factor at @xmath58",
    "we start by using the @xmath59 functions to eliminate the integrals over the momenta @xmath60 and @xmath52 in the expression of @xmath61 and over @xmath62 and @xmath52 in the expression of @xmath63 . after performing the traces over @xmath64 matrices we get    @xmath65\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath66 next , by writing @xmath67 and @xmath68 we perform the integrals over @xmath69 and @xmath70 in eq .",

    "the expression ( [ final ] ) is , of course , valid for @xmath77 , but the infinite value one gets in the limit @xmath78 seems to contradict the normalization of the electric charge ( [ qnorm ] ) which has been demonstrated previously .",
    "this is a disturbing situation which deserves a careful examination .",
    "looking back , we remark that the contradiction comes from the evaluation of some @xmath79 functions : @xmath80 which have been written as @xmath81 at @xmath820 , while at @xmath0=0 they have been written as @xmath83 in the last expression the integral has been replaced by @xmath33 because it was assumed that the uncertainty in the meson mass is much smaller than @xmath84 .",
    "as it was shown above , at @xmath13 the magnitude of @xmath33 does not really matter because it disappears from the expression of the norm .",
    "this is not the case at @xmath58 where @xmath33 remains in the final expression of the form factor . searching for a way to cure the disagreement between the two cases we conjecture that @xmath33 must be seen as the overlapping time of the initial and final systems",
    "of course , @xmath33 depends on the reference system we consider . on the other hand ,",
    "the form factor is scalar under lorentz transformations which means that we have to choose a particular reference frame and write @xmath33 in terms of lorentz invariant quantities .",
    "( we recall that a similar problem occurs in the definition of the scattering cross - sections , where the flux of the incident particles is written in terms of the relative momentum in the center of mass system . )",
    "we choose the breit frame and consider that @xmath33 is the time necessary for an object of length @xmath85 to pass along another object of length @xmath85 .",
    "we put then @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the lorentz contracted length of the meson box of size @xmath88 in its rest frame .",
    "the numerical results quoted in this paper have been obtained by replacing the symmetry scheme based on the full lorentz group with the symmetry under the collinear group which is equivalent with the flux tube model with frozen transverse degrees . in this respect our working approximation may be considered as opposite to the light front approach @xcite where the transverse degrees of freedom are explicitly taken into account , while the confining potential is assumed to give a fixed contribution to the free meson mass .    in the present approach the relativistic generalization of the potential energy of the quark system",
    "is explicitly taken into account as the 4-momentum of an effective field and the mean contribution of the transverse degrees of freedom to the meson energy is included in the quark masses .",
    "the longitudinal and the temporal degrees of freedom are then the only active and the multiple integral in eq.([final ] ) reduces to a simple one .    in this case",

    "we remark that @xmath102 does not really appear at the end because it will be cancelled out by a similar factor coming from the normalization condition of the internal wave functions .",
    "this is not the case for @xmath88 , which still remains in the expression of the electromagnetic form factor at @xmath58 .",
    "however , keeping in mind that the form factor is really normalized to unity at @xmath13 , we shall take @xmath88 as a free parameter enabling us to impose this constraint on the expression ( [ 11fem ] ) .    a first consequence of the relation ( [ 11fem ] )",

[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we notice that the theoretical results are very sensitive with respect to the up and down quark masses .",
    "this let us believe that the numerical results quoted above may be improved by introducing a difference between the lightest quarks .",
    "we notice also that the values of the quark masses found from the best fit are a bit larger than the currently used constituent masses @xcite.this is normal taking into account that the contribution of the transverse degrees of freedom has been included in the quark masses .",
    "the model we presented in this paper is a relativistic model for bound states .",
    "it enabled us to calculate the electromagnetic form factors by means of the overlap integral over the internal wave functions of the initial and final mesons .",
    "the internal function we used is just a suitable trial function serving to illustrate the qualities of the model , not the solution of a dynamical scheme .",
    "we remark that in the infinite momentum limit it does not have any of the usual asymptotic forms quoted in @xcite .",
    "this is because the distribution amplitude ( [ phi1 ] ) writes in terms of real lorentz scalar products which introduce `` bad '' components of momenta .",
    "it demonstrates , however , that the existence of the meson form factors can be explained through the stable , time invariant structure of the mesons and also , that the colour fluctuations contributing to the quark form factor can be neglected at low momentum transfer .",
    "the remarkable point is that our results are unexpectedly consistent , as it can be seen from the comparison of the pion radius with the box length @xmath88 .",
    "first we mention that @xmath88 can not be infinite or @xmath121 . in the first case @xmath122 for",
    "any @xmath77 and mesons would behave like rigid bodies with respect to the electromagnetic interaction . in the second case mesons",
    "would be structureless .    in our specific case @xmath88",
    "can be calculated from the normalization conditions of the meson state ( [ norm ] ) and of the electromagnetic form factor ( [ qnorm ] ) .",
    "freezing two spatial degrees of freedom , using the internal function ( [ phi1 ] ) and performing the replacements @xmath123 and @xmath124 we get :          it is important to notice that the value we get for @xmath88 may help us to put an upper limit for the time @xmath29 involved in the definition of the effective field @xmath14 . to this end",
    "we recall that @xmath88 is related with the overlapping time of the systems representing the mesons and conjecture that the model is valid up to meson energies where this time is sensibly larger than the time involved in the definition of the effective field @xmath14 .",
    "this means @xmath128 .",
    "then , if we expect the model holds at least up to @xmath129 gev@xmath130 we get @xmath131s .    a last point we comment here",
    "concerns the continuity of the form factor from the space - like to the time - like region . in principle",
    "our expression ( [ 11fin ] ) can be continued at @xmath132 , but it will have no significance in the absence of a dynamical scheme of the strong interaction .      *",
