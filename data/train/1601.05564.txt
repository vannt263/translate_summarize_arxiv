    "gauge hierarchy problem continues to be an unsolved issue in the standard model of elementary particles despite its enormous success in describing physics up to tev scale .",
    "a solution to the gauge hierarchy problem was proposed by randall and sundrum ( rs model ) by considering an extra dimension compactified into a circle @xmath0 with a @xmath1 orbifolding @xcite .",
    "the modulus corresponding to the radius of the extra dimension in such a model can be stabilised via goldberger - wise ( gw ) stabilization mechanism @xcite .",
    "both rs and gw model do not invoke any intermediate scale in the theory and are robust against radiative corrections .",
    "this resulted into a large volume of work in particle phenomenology and cosmology in the backdrop of randall - sundrum warped geometry scenario . in the context of collider physics , possible",
    "role of first kaluza - klein ( kk ) graviton mode have been extensively studied in atlas and cms detectors at lhc which have already set a stringent lower bound for the mass of the first kk graviton to be @xmath2tev @xcite .",
    "various implications of this have been discussed in @xcite",
    ".    there have been several efforts to formulate some variants of the original rs model .",
    "one such effort addresses a similar warped geometry model with non flat 3-branes in contrast to the original rs model which assumes two flat 3-branes sitting at the two orbifold fixed points .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that one can indeed generalise the model with non - zero cosmological constant on the visible 3-brane i.e on our observable universe and can resolve the gauge hierarchy problem concomitantly . in this generalised rs model @xcite",
    "it has been shown that the 3-branes can be either de - sitter ( ds ) or anti de - sitter ( ads ) where the magnitude of the induced cosmological constant and that of the warping parameter are intimately connected .",
    "it is therefore crucially important to determine whether in such non - flat warped geometry models , the goldberger - wise stabilisation mechanism , which neglects the backreaction of the stabilising field , can still be employed successfully to stabilise the radius of the extra dimension to the desired value @xmath3 .",
    "moreover it is worth while to explore the effect of the brane cosmological constant on the masses of the graviton kk modes which are expected to play important role in high energy scattering processes .",
    "this work is focussed into addressing the following two questions in a generalised rs model :    1 .",
    "can the modulus of extra dimension be stabilised to a global minimum for the entire range of values of the cosmological constant in the context of generalised rs model ?",
    "what are the kk graviton masses for different choices of cosmological constant ?    after a brief review of original and generalised rs model in first two sections , we focus into the modulus stabilization conditions as well as the expressions for the modified kk graviton masses due to the presence of non - vanishing brane cosmolgical constant .",
    "in the rs scenario , it is predicted that there exists an extra spatial dimension in addition to the ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional observed universe .",
    "the corresponding five dimensional bulk space - time is described by a metric @xmath4 where greek indices @xmath5 , @xmath6 run over 0,1,2,3 and refer to the four observed dimensions .",
    "the geometry of the extra dimension is @xmath7 and is described by the coordinate y . here",
    "the circle @xmath8 has radius @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is the bulk cosmolgical constant , @xmath11 .",
    "the factor @xmath12 is known as the warp factor .",
    "the @xmath13 constant slices at @xmath14 and at @xmath15 are known as the hidden and the visible branes , the observable universe being identified with the latter which has a negative brane tension as opposed to the hidden brane with a positive brane tension .",
    "it can be shown that a mass parameter @xmath16 of the order of planck scale is warped to a value tev on the visible brane following the relation @xmath17 , for @xmath18 .",
    "thus in this picture , the stability of higgs mass against large radiative correction is ensured by the warped geometry of the five dimensional spacetime . in this context",
    "the kk graviton mass modes are determined by considering a small fluctuation around the flat metric with its kk decomposition .",
    "some of these modes have masses @xmath19 ; @xmath20tev ; @xmath21tev for @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the requirement of @xmath23 emerges from the fact that k , which measures the bulk curvature must be smaller than the planck scale so that the classical solutions of einstein s equations in the bulk can be trusted @xcite .    in the context of modulus stabilisation ,",
    "it was proposed by goldberger and wise that the modulus of the model ( i.e. the radius of the extra dimension ) can be stabilised to the desired value by introducing a massive scalar field in the bulk .",
    "evaluating the effective modulus potential due to the massive scalar field of mass m , one gets the stabilisation condition as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values ( vev ) of the scalar field on hidden and visible brane .",
    "taking @xmath26 and @xmath27 one gets @xmath18 . in this analysis",
    "it was further shown that both @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( in planckian unit ) must be smaller than unity so that the effect of back - reaction on the background metric can be ignored .",
    "moreover the condition of having a global minimum for the modulus potential was found to be @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is a perturbation on the visible brane tension .",
    "present cosmological observation indicates the possible existence of a 4-dimensional cosmological constant ( @xmath32 ) in planckian unit .",
    "it has been demonstrated @xcite that by relaxing the condition of zero cosmological constant ( i.e flat 3-brane ) it is possible to obtain a more general expression for the warp factor .",
    "starting from a general metric ansatz , @xmath33}g_{\\mu\\nu}dx^{\\mu}dx^{\\nu } -dy^2   \\label{generalisedr - smetric}\\ ] ] one may solve the bulk equations for both anti de - sitter(ads ) and de - sitter ( ds ) 3-branes .",

    "here @xmath39 is the brane cosmological constant and @xmath40 is a dimensionless parameter . just as in the original rs model ,",
    "this generalised scenario also can address the gauge hierarchy problem for appropriate choices of the parameters which we discuss below .",
    "the scalar mass on the visible brane @xcite gets warped through the warp factor . in order to resolve the gauge hierarchy problem it must satisfy , @xmath41}= 10^{-16}= m / m_0 $ ] .",

    "+ in the following section we employ the gw stabilisation mechanism for the generalised rs model with non - flat branes to derive the new stability condition .",
    "to stabilise the modulus @xmath9 in the context of generalised rs model , we adopt the method proposed by goldberger and wise @xcite .",
    "let us consider a massive scalar field @xmath47 in the bulk with quartic interactions on the planck ( @xmath14 ) and visible branes ( @xmath15 ) .",

    "it has been shown in @xcite that the magnitude of the cosmological constant on ads brane is constrained to have an upper bound and must lies between @xmath56 . due to this tiny value of the magnitude of the cosmological constant , we keep terms up to @xmath40 order .",
