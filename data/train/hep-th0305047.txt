    "much of our understanding of physics and mathematics relies on our ability not only to find relationships between various quantities through equations ( such as differential equations ) , but also their solutions . in many cases one",
    "resorts to assuming that the solution can be expressed as a series expansion @xmath2 in some parameter @xmath0 . depending on the nature of the problem at hand ,",
    "a first attempt at a series expansion might yield a convergent series , whereas in other situations , a divergent series .",
    "one finds in many instances that a divergent series arises , e.g. in perturbative expansions in field theories  @xcite    convergent series are generally well behaved .",
    "divergent series , on the other hand , require more careful attention to elucidate their meaning . in many scenarios , the information one obtains , such as an expression for the coefficient function @xmath3 , is very useful and various schemes has been proposed that allow to one assign values to divergent series .",
    "many analytical and numerical methods have been put forward , e.g. borel summation , pad and borel - pad approximants , large order perturbation theory ( see  @xcite and references therein ) , variational perturbation theory ( @xcite and refs . therein ) , sequence transformations ( @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "another , but little known , numerical procedure is that of mellin - barnes regularisation originally proposed by kowalenko  _ et al _",
    "@xcite , which can be used to obtain finite numerical values of a divergent ( or convergent ) series , for certain values of complex @xmath0 .",
    "this method is an exact procedure in the sense that no approximations are made , and it yields the same numerical values as those obtained by borel summation for borel summable series .    further investigation of the numerical mellin - barnes regularisation method , particularly with coefficient functions @xmath3 containing @xmath4-functions , and extending @xmath0 to the entire complex plane ( i.e. including non - borel summable series ) , revealed an analytical relationship between series expansions in @xmath0 to those in @xmath1 .",
    "this is in contrast to the basic borel transformation , in which case , before and after the transform one still has a series in @xmath0 .    with this new insight",
    "we show how one can transform a series in @xmath2 to a series in @xmath5 .",
    "it then becomes apparent that the transform makes no distinction between borel ( alternating ) and non - borel ( non - alternating ) summable series .",
    "in fact , in some cases it converts one to the other , and also converts a divergent series to a convergent series .",
    "as we shall see , depending on the form of the coefficient function @xmath3 , a single series in @xmath0 can yield more than one series in @xmath1 .",
    "many functions have both convergent and divergent series , and integral , representations .",
    "our ability to understand the solution to a problem is only as good as our ability to extract information about the coefficient function @xmath3 .",
    "an advantage of the proposed transformation is that given @xmath3 , we can look at both the series in @xmath0 and in @xmath1 .",
    "if one has the exact expression for @xmath3 , be it as a convergent or divergent series , then it can be regarded as the solution to the problem .",
    "if we only have an approximate expression for @xmath3 , it is hoped that converting @xmath6 to @xmath5 might allow us to gain more understanding of the solution to the problem .",
    "consider a sum of a finite number of terms @xmath7 for any ( meromorphic ) coefficient function @xmath3 .",
    "using cauchy s integral theorem , we can express this as @xmath8 where we have introduced a short hand notation for the integral .",
    "it is assumed that the only poles within the contour @xmath9 are the simple poles ( of residue @xmath10 ) of @xmath11 at @xmath12 .",
    "( of course , if there are poles due to @xmath13 , their residues are included ) .    if we express the closed contour @xmath14 where @xmath15 intersects the @xmath16 axis somewhere at @xmath17 , and @xmath18 intersects the @xmath16 axis between @xmath19 and @xmath20 as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure ] , the nature of @xmath21 in the complex @xmath22-plane may allow one to adjust the angles @xmath23 and @xmath24 of @xmath15 so that @xmath25 where we note the angles are centred at @xmath26 , rather than at the origin @xmath27 . if these limits can be achieved , the integral along @xmath15 is independent of @xmath19 .",
    "this is possible if @xmath13 contains @xmath4-functions .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ zabm25 ] for an example , where the coefficient function is given by  ( [ classahodsfinitesum ] ) .",
    "note that the choice of contours @xmath15 and @xmath18 will depend on both @xmath28 and @xmath13 , since for a given @xmath13 it is possible one will need a different contour for @xmath29 , say , compared to @xmath30 .    using the short hand notation in  ( [ theint ] )",
    ", we can express the loop integration in  ( [ theint ] ) as @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the sum of the residues of the poles within @xmath9 , where the last equality is based on the assumption that @xmath13 has no poles within @xmath9 .    now consider another contour @xmath33 , where @xmath34 intersects the @xmath16 axis somewhere between @xmath35 and @xmath36 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure ] , and we note the sign in front of @xmath15 is changed because of the counterclockwise convention of cauchy s intergral theorem .",
    "one finds that @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the sum of the residues of the poles within @xmath39 .",
    "thus , combining  ( [ resrhs ] ) and  ( [ reslhs ] ) , we find that @xmath40 this is the main result of the paper , and is applicable to cases where @xmath3 represents either a convergent or divergent series .",
    "one can use this result for analytical and numerical studies of a series . in numerical studies , if the contour @xmath15 in fig .",
    "[ figure ] is chosen with @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the first line of  ( [ mainresult ] ) gives the mellin - barnes regularisation  @xcite .",
    "in general , one often finds that if @xmath43 is a divergent series , then @xmath44 is a convergent series , and the nature of the integrand in  ( [ reslhs ] ) is such that as @xmath45 then @xmath46 , so @xmath47 therefore we find that @xmath48 is finite and can be regarded as the convergent series representation of @xmath43 , and also of @xmath49 . observe that since @xmath43 is a divergent series , it grows with @xmath19 , but so does @xmath50 , in such a way that @xmath51 is finite and independent of @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath52",
    "let consider an example with a series having a coefficient function of @xmath53 where , without loss of generality , we take @xmath54 and a non - integer . subsituting this into  ( [ mainresult ] ) we see that the only poles within @xmath9 are simple poles at @xmath55 due to @xmath11 , and their residues sum up to yield the divergent series @xmath56    within @xmath39 we find two sets of simple poles .",
    "one set at @xmath57 from @xmath11 where the residue of the pole at @xmath58 is @xmath59 where we have used the @xmath4-function reflection formula , @xmath60 .",
    "summing these residues , we see that it is a convergent series and therefore we can let @xmath45 : ",
    "@xmath61 where @xmath62 is the incomplete @xmath4-function .",
    "this series , arising from the poles of @xmath11 , can be regarded as the counterpart of  ( [ alphads ] ) where we take the sum over negative , instead of positive , integers .",
    "the other set of poles at @xmath63 are from @xmath64 , and the residue of the pole at @xmath65 is @xmath66 and summing up these residues gives a convergent series as well :  @xmath67 which will cancel the first term in the brackets in  ( [ alpha1series ] ) .",
    "this series arises from the poles in the coefficient function @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , the total sum of residues within @xmath69 is @xmath70 where we have used the @xmath4-function reflection formula again .",
    "we thus see the relation of the divergent series  ( [ alphads ] ) and the convergent series  ( [ alphacs ] ) via  ( [ mainresult ] ) .",
    "if we now consider @xmath71 to be an integer in  ( [ alphads ] ) , say ,",
    "@xmath72 , we get the so - called ` paradigm divegerent series ' :  @xmath73 inserting this into  ( [ mainresult ] ) , we have simple poles at @xmath55 within @xmath9 , and the sum of their residues yields the series  ( [ parads ] ) . since @xmath74 has poles at @xmath57 , we now have double poles within @xmath39 , where the residue of the pole at @xmath58 is @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the digamma function .",
    "since the sum of these residues is a convergent series , we can take @xmath45 , and obtain @xmath77 note that this is the same as  ( [ alphacs ] ) with @xmath72 .",
    "notice the presence of @xmath78 in each residue term in  ( [ paralog ] ) , which can pulled out of the summation in  ( [ paraans ] ) .",
    "however , the summation of the @xmath79 terms yields a @xmath80 term , such that it precisely cancels the @xmath78 , resulting in the @xmath78-free expression in  ( [ paraans ] ) .",
    "this is an indication whereby if one finds logarithmic terms in a series expansion , that upon summation of the series such terms might vanish .",
    "thus we see some of main features of  ( [ mainresult ] ) :  a series in @xmath81 is converted to a series in @xmath82 , i.e. a non - alternating series is converted to an alternating series in the inverse of the expansion parameter .",
    "if double , or higher order , poles are encountered , derivatives ( wrt @xmath22 ) of the coefficient function , @xmath13 , and power term , @xmath83 , yield derivatives of @xmath4-functions and @xmath84 terms respectively . we note that if @xmath85 , then  ( [ paraans ] ) is real , whereas if @xmath86 , a non - zero imaginary part arises of magnitude @xmath87 .",
    "if we consider the application of borel summation on the ` paradigm divergent series ' ( pds ) ,  ( [ parads ] ) , : - @xmath88 one inserts @xmath89 into  ( [ borel1 ] ) , interchanges the integral and summation signs , and then does the summation to yield @xmath90 if @xmath85 , we have an alternating series , and it is asserted that the ` finite value ' of the divergent series  ( [ borel1 ] ) is @xmath91 and yields the same results ( with a minus sign ) as in  ( [ paraans ] ) . in this case",
    "the series is borel summable .    if , however , @xmath86 , we have a non - alternating series and there is now a pole on the line of integration at @xmath92 in  ( [ borel ] ) .",
    "a potential ambiguity now arises as one would need a prescription ( e.g. principal parts ) to handle the pole .",
    "such non - alternating series are regarded as being ` non - borel summable ' .",
    "these issues do not arise when one uses the transform  ( [ mainresult ] ) since it can be used in exactly the same way to evaluate non - alternating series as for alternating series ( with appropriate contours for each case ) .",
    "let us now consider the convergent series representation of the exponential function @xmath93 .",
    "putting @xmath94 in  ( [ mainresult ] ) , then within @xmath9 , the only poles are at @xmath55 due to @xmath11 , and the sum of the residues gives @xmath95 and since this is a convergent series , we can take @xmath96 .",
    "however , while @xmath97 has zeroes when @xmath57 ( because @xmath98 has poles of residue @xmath99 at @xmath100 ) , there are no poles within @xmath39 since the poles of @xmath11 are cancelled by the zeroes of @xmath97 .",
    "this means that @xmath101 has the interesting feature that it has no divergent series representation",
    ". therefore we find from  ( [ mainresult ] ) @xmath102 where the last term is in fact independent of @xmath103 .",
    "generally it is the combination @xmath104 that determines whether the series is convergent or divergent , e.g. the geometric series @xmath105 has a finite radius of convergence  it converges if @xmath106 , and diverges for @xmath107 .",
    "however , for many series it is primarily the nature of the coefficient function @xmath3 , rather than the power term @xmath81 that determines their convergent or divergent nature .",
    "knowing @xmath3 for some function , and if it gives rise to a divergent series , one can use this technique to obtain a convergent series representation of that function .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that given a convergent series representation of a function , one can use this method to obtain its divergent series representation , if such exists .",
    "let us look at an example of how a divergent series arises , and then try to gain an understanding of how such objects might be handled . consider the following integral , @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 is the modified bessel function .",
    "if we express @xmath111 as a power series , interchange the integration and summation , we find that @xmath112 if , instead , we express @xmath113 as a power series and do the same operations , we see that @xmath114 using stirling s formula @xmath115 for large @xmath116 , we see that for large enough @xmath116 , @xmath117 grows faster than @xmath81 for all @xmath28 .",
    "if we take  ( [ classahods ] ) literally we see that the series diverges as we add more and more terms , which is why quotes are used in  ( [ classahods ] ) , i.e. @xmath118 .",
    "thus the ` small - g ' expanson  ( [ classahods ] ) gives a divergent series , while the ` large - g ' expansion  ( [ classahocs ] ) is a convergent series .",
    "these are different series representations of the same function .",
    "the origin of the divergent behaviour in  ( [ classahods ] ) is due to the fact that we have been ` careless ' in interchanging the order of integration and summation ( of an infinite number of terms ) in deriving  ( [ classahods ] ) .",
    "however , the coefficient function of the divergent series  ( [ classahods ] ) @xmath119 does contain _ all _ the information about the function @xmath120 . to see this ,",
    "consider the sum of a finite number of terms of  ( [ classahods ] ) @xmath121 where we have used @xmath122 ( @xcite 8.335 ) .",
    "inserting the coefficient function into  ( [ mainresult ] ) we find that the residues of the poles within @xmath9 gives  ( [ classahodsfinitesum ] ) .",
    "it is well known that for small @xmath123 we can sum a few terms to give approximate ( and very accurate ) results for @xmath120  this is the essence of asymptotic expansions .",
    "but if we consider @xmath124 it gives the same numerical values as the integral form of @xmath120 for @xmath125 .",
    "figure  [ zabm25 ] gives a density plot of the real part of the integrand in  ( [ classdsandint ] ) for @xmath126 showing the oscillatory nature , and also a suitable contour for @xmath15 is given by the dark line .",
    "a density plot of the imaginary part of the integrand is similar .    within @xmath39",
    "there are two sets of poles , each set giving a convergent series .",
    "letting @xmath45 , we find the residues of the set ` a ' of poles at @xmath127 are @xmath128 while the set ` b ' of poles of at @xmath129 gives residues @xmath130 and @xmath131 if @xmath123 is real , the sums can be converted to bessel functions , @xmath132 for the case of @xmath133 , we can express the imaginary part of @xmath120 as @xmath134 figure  [ zabplot ] shows a plot of the imaginary parts .",
    "the euler - heisenberg - schwinger one - loop qed effective action  @xcite , for a constant background magnetic field @xmath135 can be expressed as a proper time integral : ",
    "@xmath136 where @xmath137 is the space - time volume factor , and @xmath138 where , @xmath139 .",
    "if we expand @xmath140 as a power series about @xmath141 we obtain the divergent series ( and hence the use of quotes ) :  @xmath142 with coefficient function @xmath143 and @xmath144 are the bernoulli numbers , whose magnitudes are given by @xmath145 while @xmath146 is the riemann @xmath147-function .",
    "we have used the following relation between the @xmath4- and @xmath147-functions ( @xcite 9.535 ) : ",
    "@xmath148 notice in  ( [ schcf ] ) we have not written @xmath149 for @xmath116 integer as we wish to maintain the analytical structure of  ( [ gammazeta ] ) for complex @xmath150 .",
    "if one replaces @xmath151 with @xmath152 ( even though they give the same divergent series ) , which will cancel the other @xmath152 term in  ( [ schcf ] ) , the pole / singularity structure at @xmath153 will give different residues from the simple ( i.e. non - leading singularities ) poles at @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "the resolution of ambiguities of this nature depends on the problem at hand . in this case , the term @xmath157 is not the same as @xmath158 for complex z.    if we insert the coefficient function  ( [ schcf ] ) into  ( [ mainresult ] ) we find within the contour @xmath9 there are simple poles at @xmath55 whose residues give  ( [ schdsnew ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath159    within @xmath39",
    "we have simple and double poles at @xmath160 and @xmath161 ; two sets of simple poles , one set at @xmath162 and another set at @xmath163 .",
    "the residues of all poles within @xmath39 are related to @xmath164 through @xmath165 letting @xmath45 , we find the closed form @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the derivative of the hurwitz @xmath147-function , @xmath168 numerical values for  ( [ schresult ] ) can be obtained using mathematica  @xcite , where @xmath169 is expressed in terms of the barnes g - function  @xcite .",
    "if instead one has constant electric fields , the one - loop effective action is @xmath170 where @xmath171 , and @xmath172 one finds very good numerical agreement of @xmath173",
    "the above examples illustrate how various series expansions of a function are related .",
    "if a problem is well posed , one would hope to obtain well defined results .",
    "if a divergent series in @xmath28 arises , the starting point is to utilize the information contained in the coefficient function @xmath13 . by considering a sum of a finite number of terms , i.e. a partial sum , and expressing it as a cauchy integral representation via  ( [ theint ] ) , one then attempts to find a contour @xmath9 that can be split into two parts @xmath18 and @xmath15 as in fig .",
    "[ figure ] . if a suitable contour can be found , the integral along @xmath18",
    "is subtracted from the partial sum , the result of which gives the integral along @xmath15 .",
    "this in turn is related to the corresponding ( convergent ) series in @xmath174 obtained from the same coefficient function @xmath13 .",
    "equation  ( [ mainresult ] ) , relating a series in @xmath28 to a series in @xmath174 is an exact relation .",
    "we also see there is no essential difference between alternating ( borel summable ) and non - alternating ( non - borel summable ) series , in contrast to the situation where a prescription is required to handle the potential ambiguity in the borel summation procedure for non - alternating series ( e.g. for the case of @xmath86 in  ( [ borel ] ) ) .",
    "if one has a situation where there are several @xmath4-functions in the numerator of @xmath13 , then the borel summation procedure would result in each @xmath4-function being expressed in the integral form  ( [ gammafunc ] ) , leading to a multi - dimensional integral version of  ( [ borel ] ) .",
    "an advantage of using  ( [ mainresult ] ) is that it is a one - dimensional integral for arbitrary @xmath13 .",
    "if there are @xmath4-functions in the coefficient function in the form of @xmath175 where @xmath116 is a positive integer , and @xmath71 not an integer , then it is likely that the @xmath4-function reflection formula @xmath60 will introduce phase factors in the residues of poles within @xmath39 .",
    "this can be seen in  ( [ alphacs1 ] ) and  ( [ alphacs2 ] ) which respectively give phases factors of the type @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "this leads to terms in the series that will , in general , be complex if @xmath71 is not an integer .",
    "care should be exercised , for example , in situations where large - order perturbation results are used  since expressing @xmath178 , say , as @xmath179 for large @xmath116 could lead to different imaginary parts .",
    "it is not always the case that applying  ( [ mainresult ] ) to a non - alternating series will give a finite imaginary part  for example , consider the geometric series , @xmath105 , for @xmath29 , say , which when summed gives @xmath180 .",
    "an interesting feature of  ( [ classaho ] ) is that the divergent series representation  ( [ classahods ] ) , after the application of  ( [ mainresult ] ) yields two convergent series , ( [ bess14 ] ) and  ( [ bess34 ] ) , which are also valid when @xmath133 , even though the integral in  ( [ classaho ] ) is undefined .",
    "thus , in some cases , the range of applicability of the divergent ( and convergent ) series exceeds that of the integral representation of the function in  ( [ classaho ] ) .    in general , the difficult part of a problem is to find the exact coefficient functions , and often one has to resort to some approximation .",
    "the results obtained from  ( [ mainresult ] ) are only as good as our ability to find the exact coefficient function .",
    "the form of  ( [ mainresult ] ) is well suited for analytical and numerical evaluation of series via contour integration ( using packages like mathematica ) . by expressing some divergent series as a convergent series , or even vice - versa",
    ", one might be able gain a further understanding of the nature of the solution to a problem .",
    "i benefitted from numerous discussions with nicole bell , john costella , bob delbourgo , angas hurst , tien kieu , don koks , vic kowalenko , john mcintosh , ray sawyer , jerry stephenson and cameron wellard .",
