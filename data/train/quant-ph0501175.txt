    "the ultimate security of quantum cryptography stems from the non - cloning theorem@xcite of quantum mechanics , which is applied to a single quantum system . in other words",
    ", quantum information can only be shared between two parties , the one ( alice ) who creates it and the one ( bob ) who receives it .",
    "therefore , in the implementation in optical communication , the ideal source is a single photon source with information carried by individual photons .",
    "so far a weak coherent state from a laser is closest to a single photon source for quantum cryptography .",
    "the experimental realization@xcite of the first proposed quantum cryptography protocol , known as bb84 protocal@xcite , involved a heavily attenuated thermal source ( which is worse than a laser in the aspect of multi - photon events ) .",
    "however , the existence of multiple photon events for a weak coherent state , even though very rare , poses serious problem for the security of the protocol .",
    "an eavesdropper ( eve ) can in principle use the so - called photon number splitting attack to tap the information without being noticed .",
    "recent analysis by ltkenhaus@xcite on the security of quantum cryptography by a weak coherent state puts limit on the data rate and transmission distance for secure key distribution .",
    "significant progress has been made in producing single photon states@xcite .",
    "but so far these sources are fluorescence - based and have small efficiency .",
    "furthermore , because the emission depends on energy structure , it has a fixed wavelength and a finite time response for high repetition rate .",
    "so they are limited for practical applications .",
    "recently a new scheme was proposed@xcite and realized@xcite for producing a photon source with same single photon rate as a coherent state but less two - photon events .",
    "the scheme relies on a two - photon quantum interference phenomenon to reduce and eventually cancel the two - photon events from a coherent state .",
    "although it can not take out all the multi - photon events , it does take out the most dominating multi - photon events  two - photon events .",
    "this modified coherent state ( mcs ) has the advantages of high data rate , well defined direction and wave - length independence for practical application in quantum cryptography .",
    "a new quantum cryptography protocol(sarg04 ) was recently proposed@xcite against the photon number splitting attack for weak coherent state .",
    "such a scheme relies on a smarter encoding scheme that is based on nonorthogonal states and requires at least two or more photons for eve to recover the data .",
    "thus eve needs at least three photons to use the photon number splitting attack .",
    "if we use this protocol on the modified coherent state , we will make a three - photon interference effect to cancel the three - photon term so that eve can only rely on the 4-photon or higher order terms to apply the photon number splitting attack .",
    "so the modified coherent state still has advantage over a weak coherent state in this new protocol .",
    "because of the existence of the multi - photon terms , the modified coherent state has similar security problems as the coherent state .",
    "but the influence of those higher order terms will be smaller .",
    "the security problem of the coherent state was investigated by l \" utkenhaus @xcite and brassard et al@xcite . in the following",
    ", we will apply the same line of argument of ref.@xcite to look for the optimum secure data rate and transmission distance for a given transmission loss and dark counts of the detectors for the modified coherent state in both bb84 protocol in ref.@xcite and the new sarg04 protocol in ref.@xcite . to do that , we need to find the probability @xmath0 for multi - photon event and the probability @xmath1 to detect any photon in such a state",
    ". we will start in the following with the description of the modified coherent state .",
    "the modified coherent state is just a coherent state without the two - photon or three - photon terms .",
    "it can be generated by mixing a coherent state with a two - photon state from parametric down - conversion .",
    "there are two types of mixing .",
    "the first one is to inject the coherent state into an optical parametric amplifier with a small gain .",
    "this is the scheme first proposed by stoler to produce light source with sub - poisonian statistics .",
    "the second one mixes the two fields with a beamsplitter . in practice",
    "the first method is more direct and simpler to implement . in the following calculation ,",
    "the results are more or less same .",
    "we will consider only the first method .    for simplicity of argument",
    ", we will only treat single mode case here . in reality",
    ", this corresponds to , for example , a single temporal mode of pulses of light .",
    "we will concentrate on the probabilities of detecting photons in each pulse .",
    "the data rate discussed below will be the probability per pulse . in cw case",
    ", we will consider the average photon number ( @xmath2 for coherent state , see below ) rather than the intensity as our parameter .",
    "so the detection time does not appear as a separate parameter but is included in the average photon number .",
    "however , we do require the detection time be much smaller than the coherence time of the field to ensure the single mode approximation .    in an optical parametric amplifier ,",
    "the interaction hamiltonian is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is proportional to the amplitude of the pump field and the nonlinear conversion coefficient of the nonlinear medium .    with the injection of a coherent state ,",
    "the initial state is simply a coherent state @xmath5 and the output state becomes @xmath6 @xmath7 is proportional to @xmath4 . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the above state is simply the two - photon coherent state or the squeezed coherent state first discussed by yuen@xcite . in order to find the probability of photon number , we expand the above state in the photon number state base and obtain from ref.@xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the @xmath10th - order hermite polynomial and @xmath11 more specifically to our interest ,",
    "we list @xmath12,\\cr c_3 & = & { c_0 \\over \\sqrt{6 } } \\big [ -{3\\nu\\alpha\\over \\mu^2}+ \\big({\\alpha\\over\\mu}\\big)^3\\big],\\cr c_4 & = & { c_0 \\over \\sqrt{24}}\\big [ 3\\big({\\nu\\over\\mu } \\big)^2- 6{\\nu\\alpha^2\\over \\mu^3}+ \\big({\\alpha\\over\\mu}\\big)^4\\big],\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from the above , we easily find the probability for multi - photon event as @xmath13 this quantity is minimized when @xmath14 with a minimum value of @xmath15 notice that the two - photon probability @xmath16 is zero under this condition .",
    "this results from a two - photon interference effect between the coherent state and the spontaneous parametric down - conversion , i.e. , interference between the two - photon amplitude @xmath17 of parametric down - conversion and the two - photon amplitude @xmath18 of a coherent state .    for sarg04 protocol ,",
    "we need to minimize the probability for events of three or more photons .",
    "this probability is given by @xmath19 which is minimized when @xmath20 with a minimum value of @xmath21 similar to the two - photon case , when condition in eq.(10 ) is satisfied , three - photon probability @xmath22 is zero as a result of three - photon interference .",
    "it is not easy to understand how a three - photon effect can arise from parametric down - conversion with only even number of photons .",
    "what happens is that a two - photon event from parametric down conversion combines with a single photon event in coherent state to form a three - photon event with an amplitude of @xmath23 .",
    "this amplitude interferes with another three - photon event directly from the coherent state with an amplitude of @xmath24 .",
    "complete cancellation occurs when the two amplitudes are equal leading to eq.(10 ) .    to evaluate the photon detection probability @xmath1",
    ", we notice that in practice , photodetection usually has non - unit efficiency",
    ". this will reduce the signal level .",
    "we need to calculate the photon detection probability under this non - ideal condition .",
    "the non - unit efficiency is modelled as a beamsplitter of transmissivity @xmath25 .",
    "we may start with the photon number probability for single mode case as @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes normal ordering and @xmath28 with @xmath29 in the vacuum . more specifically for the case of no photon : @xmath30 then a simple calculation leads to @xmath31 where the average is over the state in eq.(2 ) .",
    "then the photon detection probability is simply @xmath32 from the appendix , we have @xmath33\\over\\sqrt{\\mu^2-|\\nu|^2(1-\\eta)^2}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) .    with the condition in eq.(7 ) for minimum multi - photon events , we have the signal probability @xmath36\\over\\sqrt{\\mu^2-|\\nu|^2(1-\\eta)^2}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or @xmath37\\over\\sqrt{\\mu^2-|\\nu|^2(1-\\eta)^2}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for condition in eq.(10 ) .",
    "next we evaluate the secure transmission rate based on the formulism from ref.@xcite .",
    "the communication rate per slot ( pulse ) for a certain error rate @xmath38 is given by @xmath39.\\ ] ] in the above equation , the parameter @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 which is the probability of detection events originating from the desirable photon events .",
    "the compression function @xmath42 is given by @xmath43.\\ ] ] the function @xmath44 is the shannon entropy function given by @xmath45 the function @xmath46 characterizes the performance of the error correction algorithm .     for bb84 with coherent state , ( b ) @xmath47 for bb84 with modified coherent state , and ( c ) @xmath47 for sarg04 with modified coherent state .",
    "the overall efficiency is @xmath25 = - 9.45 db , which corresponds to a transmission distance of 5 km in kth15.,width=240 ]    in order to simulate the communication rate , we need the values of @xmath1 , @xmath0 , @xmath38 , and @xmath46 . for bb84 protocol with the modified coherent state , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are given in eqs.(7 ) and ( 15 ) , respectively .",
    "however , due to the existence of dark count of any photodetectors , bob s detection events can be contributed from a signal that originates from alice s transmission , and a dark count that originates from bob s photodetectors .",
    "therefore , after taking into account the dark counts of the detectors , the signal probability @xmath1 has to be modified as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the dark count distribution and is simply equal to the dark counts per slot . similarly , the error rate is also resulted from the signal and the dark count , and can be modelled by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a constant and characterizes a baseline signal error rate .",
    "typical system should have a value of @xmath51 less than @xmath52 .",
    "the total detection efficiency @xmath25 can be separated into the channel transmission and the quantum efficiency of bob s photodetectors . for fiber communications , the transmission in the quantum channel",
    "is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the loss coefficient of the fiber channel measured in db / km , @xmath55 is the length of the fiber , and @xmath56 is the loss in the receiver bob s detection .",
    "we evaluate the communication rate as a function of the free parameters @xmath57 for mcs in bb84 and sarg04 or @xmath58 for coherent state , using parameters taken from the case kth15 in ref.@xcite .",
    "the dark counts per slot is @xmath59 .",
    "the baseline signal error rate is set to be @xmath60 .",
    "the loss coefficient @xmath54 of the fiber channel is 0.2 db / km , and the receiver loss is 1 db . the quantum efficiency of the photodetectors is @xmath61 .",
    "the total detection efficiency is then @xmath62 . for mcs in bb84 , @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "are given in eqs.(8 ) and ( 15 ) while for sarg04 protocol with mcs , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are from eqs.(11 ) and ( 16 ) , respectively .",
    "fig.1 shows the communication rates as a function of @xmath58 at @xmath55 = 5 km for the bb84 protocol with coherent state or as a function of @xmath47 for the modified coherent state in bb84 protocol and the sarg04 protocol .",
    "as can be seen , there is a clear maximum on the communication rate curve as a function of the adjustable parameter @xmath47 or @xmath58 .",
    "next we concentrate on the optimal rate as we vary the transmission distance @xmath55 , then obtain the resulting curves as shown in fig.2 .",
    "the overall efficiency @xmath25 is plotted in the top axis of fig.2 for reference .",
    "the curve ( a ) is a simple repeat of ref.@xcite for a weak coherent state in bb84 .",
    "curves ( b ) for mcs in bb84 and ( c ) for mcs in sarg04 have significant improvement over ( a ) . at zero transmission distance",
    ", we find a 4 db increase in secure data rate from modified coherent state over the coherent state in the bb84 .",
    "a further 6 db increase in secure data rate is resulted from mcs with sarg04 protocol .",
    "note that each curve features a cutoff transmission distance . modified coherent state has nearly two - fold increase in transmission distance over the coherent state in bb84 .",
    "a further nearly two - fold increase in transmission distance is found with sarg04 .",
    "this paper is based upon work supported by the national science foundation under grant no .",
    "we wish to acknowledge the support of nsf and the purdue research foundation .",
    "the average in eq.(12 ) is over the state in eq.(4 ) . to do this",
