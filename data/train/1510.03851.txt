    "quantum spin liquids  insulating magnetic phases which remain disordered down to absolute zero temperature  have attracted great interest in the nearly 30 years since anderson suggested an intimate relation between the cuprate superconductors and the resonating valence bond state .",
    "@xcite while theorists now have a good understanding of the topological orders and fractionalized excitations that characterize these systems,@xcite the experimental realization of the spin liquid phase has remained a challenge , and despite success in recent years@xcite the pool of spin liquid candidate materials remains small .",
    "the primary difficulty lies in finding systems with sufficiently large spin fluctuations , and to achieve this in the solid - state  where electron exchange mediates the spin - spin interactions ",
    "one must restrict the search to low - dimensional , geometrically - frustrated , spin-@xmath1 antiferromagnets.@xcite we believe however , that by fundamentally broadening our search to include other novel systems , we may bypass these restrictions and expedite the study of this long sought - after phase .",
    "in particular , mott insulating ultracold atoms may provide an alternate route to the experimental realization of spin liquids .",

    "_ for atomic gases optically confined to the mott state ( top ) , superexchange of whole spin-@xmath2 atoms leads to magnetic fluctuations on the order of @xmath4 . in the solid state by contrast ( bottom ) , electron superexchange restricts fluctuations to order 1 , which may be small compared to the total spin on each site .",
    "therefore , large - spin cold atoms could potentially realize exotic fluctuation - driven states not accessible with solid state systems .",

    "]    in this paper , we perform a mean field theory for spin-@xmath2 bosons on a square optical lattice , tightly confined to the mott insulating state .",
    "we choose to include only the fundamental low - energy scattering interactions ; described by a set of s - wave scattering lengths @xmath5,@xcite and tuned via microwave and optical feshbach resonances.@xcite we then show that our model supports the existence of a short - range resonating valence bond ground state , for certain values of @xmath5 and @xmath2 . at present , we omit both anisotropic dipole - dipole interactions and gauge fluctuations of the mean field , though we briefly discuss their effects in later sections of this paper . despite these omissions in our model , the results indicate that whole - atom exchange may melt magnetic order and stabilize spin liquid phases in a much broader class of systems than currently under investigation .",
    "we first write a model that captures the physics of whole - atom exchange , while fluidly describing bosons of different spin . to do this",

    ". the natural decoupling of the interaction into total angular momentum channels , each parametrized by a scattering length @xmath5 , arises from the rotational symmetry of the low - energy interaction , which conserves the total angular momentum of two bosons during a collision@xcite .    at this point ,",

    "( [ eq : projectionhamiltonian ] ) in terms of operators which possess a more direct physical interpretation , such as a polynomial in the heisenberg coupling @xmath28 , or with tensor operators of increasing rank .",
    "these methods do not move fluidly from one spin @xmath2 to another however , as one must continually define new operators upon increasing the spin .",
    "although schemes have been developed to simplify such descriptions,@xcite we instead elect to return our hamiltonian to second quantization .",
    "while doing so simplifies study for generic @xmath2 , it implicitly enlarges our hilbert space to include multiply - occupied sites .",

    "additionally , on a square lattice the dispersion takes a minimum value at @xmath84 and @xmath85 , and the value of @xmath86 at these points defines the energy gap @xmath87 .",

    "to determine the ground state of the s - rvb hamiltonian in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath88 with @xmath89 fixed ) we solve the self - consistent equation , @xmath90 , in the presence of the constraint , @xmath91 .",

    "the first occurs for @xmath98 , where one may satisfy the constraint with @xmath99 .",
    "the gapped excitations imply that the condensate fraction is zero , and so the @xmath53 field characterizes the state completely , making it a realization of a pure s - rvb spin liquid . on the other hand , for @xmath100",

    "this restores the validity of the constraint , but one must now describe the state with a spinor of condensate parameters @xmath104 , in addition to the @xmath53 field .",
    "a spinor of this type breaks spin rotational symmetry , implying a magnetically ordered ground state for @xmath100 . at present",

    ", we emphasize that these fluctuation driven states result directly from the increasing number of magnetic sublevels as one moves to larger spin .",
    "the enlarged space through which the spins may interact enhances the fluctuations , melting magnetic order and driving the system into an s - rvb spin liquid phase . despite these positive results , to better describe the atomic species used in cold atom experiments we must study the more general problem , which allows scattering through the @xmath49 angular momentum channels",
    "the most general case of the mean field hamiltonian ( [ eq : meanfieldhamiltonian ] ) allows scattering through all total angular momentum channels , @xmath116 .",
    "however , with all @xmath45 fields allowed , the increasing size of the interaction space at large @xmath2 makes the hamiltonian increasingly cumbersome to solve numerically .",

    "fortunately , since this retains only the @xmath120 pairing , we may again write the hamiltonian with the 2-dimensional spinor @xmath121 .",
    "this again allows us to diagonalize in a straightforward manner , but we omit the details due to their similarity with the s - rvb case covered previously .",
    "we motivate this ansatz by extending our results from the s - rvb ansatz , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : q00phasediagram ] , and by looking to the phase diagram for the spin 1 , 2 , and 3 spinor bose - einstein condensates.@xcite we find that our region of interest , parametrized by @xmath19 for all f and @xmath122 for @xmath21 , lies entirely within the nematic sector of these phase diagrams .",
    "additionally , our ansatz consists of a linear combination of the uniaxial and biaxial spin nematic states , which are known to posses an accidental degeneracy at mean field level.@xcite thus , it provides a suitable trial state for our specific parameter regime , capable of describing both a nematic spinor condensate and a @xmath53-only s - rvb spin liquid phase .",
    "we therefore proceed with this ansatz with the belief that our results describe the physically accessible states of the general @xmath45 model ( [ eq : meanfieldhamiltonian ] ) .",
    "while we have simplified the determination of the ground state for a general set of scattering lengths , a difficulty remains in how to best present the results graphically .",
    "the number of scattering lengths grows as @xmath123 , which on a phase diagram would require the introduction of an additional axis at each @xmath2 . to avoid this we seek an approximation which describes the various scattering lengths with a single parameter .",
    "guided by the s - rvb case , where we found that @xmath50 favors the singlet pairing and induces an s - rvb spin liquid , we shall use the following approximation for the relative scattering lengths @xmath42 , @xmath124 where scattering lengths through non - zero angular momentum channels have equal magnitude , and differ from @xmath54 through the proportionality factor @xmath125 .",

    "<S> mott insulating ultracold gases posses a unique whole - atom exchange interaction which enables large quantum fluctuations between the zeeman sublevels of each atom . by strengthening this interaction  either through the use of large - spin atoms , or by tuning the particle - particle interactions via optical feshbach resonance  </S>",
    "<S> one may enhance fluctuations and facilitate the appearance of the long sought - after quantum spin liquid phase  all in the highly tunable environment of cold atoms . to illustrate the relationship between the spin magnitude , interaction strength , and resulting magnetic phases , we present and solve a mean field theory for bosons optically confined to the one particle - per - site mott state , using both analytic and numerical methods . </S>",
    "<S> we find on a square lattice with bosons of hyperfine spin @xmath0 , that making the repulsive s - wave scattering length through the singlet channel small  relative to the higher - order scattering channels  accesses a short - range resonating valence bond ( s - rvb ) spin liquid phase . </S>"
