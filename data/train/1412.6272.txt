    "[ introduction ]    the study of nucleon resonances in meson production reaction is an interesting topic in light hadron physics . among these resonances , the negative parity nucleon excited state ,",
    "@xmath3 ( spin - parity @xmath4 ) , has been a controversial resonance for many years . in the traditional three - quark constituent model",
    ", it should be the lowest spatially excited nucleon state with one quark in a @xmath5wave  @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) has in fact a much lower mass , despite requiring two units of excitation energy .",
    "this is the long - standing mass inversion problem of the nucleon resonance spectrum .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath3 resonance couples strongly to those strangeness channels  @xcite . besides the @xmath8 channel  @xcite",
    ", it also couples strongly to @xmath9  @xcite , @xmath10  @xcite , and @xmath11  @xcite channels .",
    "moreover , it is found that the @xmath3 state is dynamically generated within a chiral unitary coupled channel approach , with its mass , width , and branching ratios in fair agreement with the experimental results  @xcite .",
    "this approach shows that the couplings of the @xmath3 resonance to the @xmath12 , @xmath8 , and @xmath13 channels could be large compared to that for the @xmath14 channel .",
    "the mass inversion problem could be understood if there were significant five - quark ( @xmath15 ) components in the wave function of the @xmath3 resonance  @xcite , which would also provide a natural explanation of the large couplings of the the @xmath3 resonance to the strangeness @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 channels .",
    "it would furthermore lead to an improvement in the description of the @xmath3 helicity amplitudes  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we wish to argue that the @xmath3 resonance might play an important role in the associated strangeness production of the @xmath0 reaction .",
    "since this reaction needs to create two @xmath20 quark pairs from the vacuum , its total cross sections should be small , which is why not much attention has been paid to it on either the theoretical or experimental sides .",
    "however , because of the week interactions of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the @xmath0 reaction near threshold provides a good new platform to study the @xmath3 resonance decaying to @xmath23 .",
    "the couplings of the @xmath3 resonance to the @xmath16 and @xmath8 channels and the ratio of @xmath24 to @xmath25 , @xmath26 , have been intensively studied within various theoretical approaches . by analyzing the @xmath27 and @xmath28 experimental data , ref .",

    "a value @xmath39 is obtained  @xcite .",
    "obviously , theoretical predictions on @xmath40 are not completely consistent with each other , thus , it is still worth studying the coupling constant @xmath24 in different ways .    in the present work ,",
    "we investigate the role of nucleon resonances in the @xmath0 reaction near threshold in the framework of an effective lagrangian approach and the isobar model .",
    "initial interaction between incoming photons and protons is modeled by an effective lagrangian which is based on the exchange of the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and kaon mesons .",
    "the @xmath41 production proceeds via excitation of the @xmath3 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 intermediate nucleon resonances which have appreciable branching ratios for the decay into the @xmath45 channel .",

    "<S> various nucleon resonances caused by the @xmath1 and @xmath2 meson exchanges and background contributions are considered . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the contribution from the @xmath3 resonance caused by the @xmath2 meson exchange plays the predominant role . </S>",
    "<S> hence , this reaction provides a good new platform to study the @xmath3 resonance . the predicted total cross section and specific features of angular distributions can be tested by future experiments . </S>"
