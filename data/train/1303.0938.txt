    "a diffuse optical component to the galactic interstellar medium ( ism ) , which is called diffuse galactic light ( dgl ) or sometimes `` optical cirrus , '' was noticed in late 1930 s .",
    "extensive studies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) revealed that the dgl is starlight scattered off by dust grains in the diffuse ism which is illuminated by the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) .",
    "the spectrum of the dgl extends to ultraviolet ( uv ) wavelengths where @xcite made extensive studies of the dust scattering properties .",
    "the dgl distribution is strongly concentrated toward the galactic plane .",
    "this concentration is attributed to the forward - scattering characteristic of interstellar dust grains coupled with a non - isotropic distribution of stars .",
    "over 50 years later , diffuse far - infrared ( ir ) emission , so - called `` ir cirrus , '' was discovered in the _ ir astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ) mission @xcite .",
    "it was quickly shown that the ir cirrus is also visible on photographic material ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and suggested that the 100  brightness varies linearly with extinction in a range of up to @xmath11 20 mjy sr@xmath12 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . finding good agreement between the structures seen on the optical images and the distribution of the co emission , @xcite pointed out that the optical images can be used to distinguish variations in the dust column density from those in the molecular column density .",
    "these studies indicate that the ir cirrus is the far - ir counterpart of the dgl ; far - ir emission in ir cirrus is thermal emission which follows the dust absorption of starlight .",
    "it is thus natural to expect a linear correlation between the dgl and far - ir brightness in the optically thin limit .",
    "a combination of optical and far - ir observations would give a powerful tool for investigating the dust properties as well as the isrf in diffuse ism ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ; @xcite ) .",
    "since the late 1990s , remarkable progress has been made in the optical and far - ir . in the optical ,",
    "new wide - field ccd cameras make it possible to cover one or more square degrees at a time , providing the uniform sensitivity over a large area and reducing the systematic uncertainty by temporal airglow variations . in the far - ir ,",
    "@xcite , hereafter sfd98 , published the @xmath13dirbe maps , which are reprocessed all - sky maps , by combining @xmath14 and dirbe ( diffuse infrared background experiment on board the cosmic background explorer satellite ) data .",
    "the @xmath13dirbe maps have dirbe quality calibration and @xmath14 resolution and feature removal of point sources as well as of artifacts from the @xmath14 scan pattern .",
    "recent studies of diffuse optical light benefit from the progress using a wide - field ccd camera and/or the @xmath13dirbe maps .",
    "analysis of diffuse optical light recorded in the @xmath15 mission against the @xmath13dirbe 100@xmath2 maps finally led @xcite to report the detection of the cosmic optical background ( cob ) .",
    "the dgl is an important foreground to be subtracted from data taken to measure the cob .",
    "thus , studying the dgl distribution is indispensable to a better understanding of the cob .",
    "the present paper mainly focuses on the following issues .",
    "the first issue is related to variations in slope parameters , i.e. , @xmath16(100@xmath2 ) , which is determined by fitting a linear function to the measured intensity of diffuse optical light @xmath17 as a function of 100@xmath2 intensity @xmath18(100@xmath2 ) .",
    "it has been indicated that slope parameters vary from cloud to cloud by a factor of 3 - 4 .",
    "for example , @xcite reported the slope parameters scatter by a factor of 3 in their sample of 4 high galactic latitude clouds , and the slope in a cloud studied by @xcite is 4 times greater than that obtained from blank - sky spectra sampled in 92,000 directions at high latitude ( mostly @xmath19 30@xmath20 by @xcite",
    ". what does cause such large variations ?",
    "another issue is related to extended red emission ( ere ) in the diffuse optical light .",
    "ere detected in the reflection nebula ngc2327 has a broad emission feature with fwhm of 1500  peaking at 7200  ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . carrying out a spectroscopic survey of high - latitude cirrus clouds",
    ", @xcite found that the cirrus spectrum does not agree with that of synthetic scattered e - type galaxy spectra , and explained this mismatch by the presence of ere .",
    "their cirrus ere feature peaked at 6000   and is shifted toward short ( bluer ) wavelength as compared with ere in hii regions ( peak @xmath11 8000  and reflection and planetary nebulae ( peak @xmath11 7000 ) . on the other hand , @xcite concluded that their blank - sky spectrum is consistent with those expected for their scattering dgl models , finding no evidence of ere in the diffuse optical light . for broadband observations , some authors favor the presence of ere in the diffuse optical light ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , while the others suggest the absence of ere ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in the course of our program to constrain the cob ,",
    "we have carried out broadband imaging of a 45  @xmath21 40  field which contains a translucent molecular cloud at high galactic latitude . in section 2",
    ", we describe the observations and the data processing details , such as flux calibration , masking , and aperture correction .",
    "correlation analysis of the intensity of diffuse optical light against the 100@xmath2 emission is presented in section 3 . in section 4",
    ", we use our measurements along with similar measurements in the literature to discuss issues affecting the correlation , and consider implications for dust scattering dgl models .",
    "a summary appears in section 5 .",
    "the target field was selected to have the following properties : ( 1 ) it is optically thin or translucent at optical wavelengths , and is characterized by a sufficient contrast at 100@xmath2 to be distinguished from the 100@xmath2 background ; ( 2 ) it is not crowded with stars and does not include bright stars .",
    "the first criterion is needed in order to see clearly the correlation between optical 100@xmath2 emission .",
    "the second is needed in order to minimize the contamination from stars , especially from the extended halos of bright stars . using these criteria ,",
    "we have selected the southern part of mbm32 , covering @xmath22 .",
    "this is a diffuse , translucent molecular cloud with extinction of @xmath23 @xcite , and located at a distance of 120 pc @xcite at @xmath24=1472 , @xmath25=407 .",
    "the surrounding sky is not a pure blank - sky ; thermal far - ir emission from interstellar dust was detected .",
    "based on the @xmath14/dirbe 100@xmath2 map , @xcite estimated @xmath26 for the cloud and @xmath27 for the surrounding sky . the 100@xmath2 intensity in the field ranges from 1.4 to 7.0 mjy sr@xmath12 .",
    "observations were made at kiso observatory on dark nights in 2011 february , april , and 2012 february .",
    "the sun and the moon were more than 35 degrees below the horizon when the data were acquired .",
    "the optical data were acquired using the 105 cm schmidt telescope with the 2kccd camera which has 2048 @xmath21 2048 pixels @xcite .",
    "the field of view of the camera is 50  @xmath21 50  with a pixel scale of 15 pixel@xmath12 .",
    "the average seeing was @xmath11 33 .",
    "the area of high - quality is approximately 45  @xmath21 40 , smaller than the field of view of the camera due to using dithering .    in figure 1 ,",
    "the observed 45  @xmath21 40  field is indicated with a white square superimposed on the @xmath14/dirbe 100@xmath2 map .",
    "images were obtained at four photometric bands , _ b _ , _ g _ , _ v _ , and _ r_. in order to reduce the effects of large - scale non - uniformity in the flat - fielding , we observed the field at two different telescope attitudes by flipping the telescope around the right ascension axis in such a way that the difference in hour angle is 180 degrees , thereby rotating the image plane on the detector by 180 degrees . in each telescope attitude , the field was observed three times per photometric band while dithering a few arcmins .",

    "the solid square represents the observed field .",
    "the brightest point of the 100@xmath2 map corresponds to the center of co emission from molecular cloud mbm32 ( @xcite ) . ]",
    "the data reduction was performed in a standard manner , including overscan subtraction , bias subtraction , and flat - fielding with dome - flat , using the iraf software package .",
    "the flux calibration was obtained from nearly 1,000 stars in a range of 15 - 19 mag which are listed in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 8 photometric catalog @xcite .",
    "the sdss magnitudes ( _ psfmag _ ) are transferred to the _ bvr _ magnitudes @xcite , and then correlated against instrumental magnitudes to derive the zero - points .",
    "the sextractor software package @xcite was used with a circular aperture of 8@xmath28 radius . the uncertainty in the zero - points is estimated to be 0.01 - 0.02 mag .",
    "the systematic errors introduced through the conversion of magnitudes are approximately 0.03 mag .      in order to obtain the diffuse component , we masked stars and galaxies in the images .",
    "our masking procedure is as follows .",
    "first , we detected all the discrete sources that exceed 1.5 @xmath29 of the local background in more than three contiguous pixels using sextractor with parameters _",
    "= 1.5 and _ detect_minarea _",
    "second , from the detected bright stars , we derived point spread functions ( psfs ) by fitting a moffat function @xmath30^{-\\beta}$ ] ( @xcite ) , where @xmath31 is the intensity at the center of the stellar image and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the fitting parameters depending on the seeing .",
    "figure [ fig02 ] shows the radial profiles of bright unsaturated stars along with the best - fit curves . adopting these best - fit curves as the psf templates ,",
    "every unsaturated star is masked with a circle with the radius where the count level is equal to 1/10 @xmath29 of the local background count level .",
    "saturated stars , magnitudes of which are supposed to be underestimated , are masked with a sufficiently large radius such as five or ten times larger than the masking radius estimated by using the flux value and the psf for an unsaturated star .",
    "the unmasked and masked images are presented in figure [ fig03 ] and figure [ fig04 ] , respectively .",
    "the fractions of masked areas in _ b , g , v _ , and _",

    "^{-\\beta}$ ] . ]      in the flux calibration of the surface brightness of extended sources , as extensively discussed by @xcite and @xcite , one must compensate for the flux that is scattered and diffracted into the aperture . here",
    "we introduce the aperture correction factor , @xmath34 , which is the fraction of the flux from a point source within the aperture .",
    "the flux from the point source , @xmath35 , in units of jy is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the signal counts within the aperture in instrumental units ( adu ) , @xmath38 the sensitivity function in units of jy adu@xmath12 .",
    "because @xmath35 is known and @xmath37 is measured , we can only derive @xmath39= @xmath38 /@xmath40 , but not @xmath38 and @xmath40 independently . in case of an extended source , no flux is lost ; the flux lost from the aperture @xmath41 is compensated for by the flux scattered in , from the outside the aperture .",
    "therefore , the brightness of the extended source @xmath42 in units of jy sr@xmath12 is simply given as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the solid angle of the aperture in units of steradians . in the above equation , @xmath42 is obtained once @xmath40 is given .",
    "the flux loss calculated from the fitted moffat function is negligible ; @xmath45 .",
    "however , @xcite pointed out that outside the central part of the profile , which is represented by a gaussian or moffat function , there is a more slowly declining halo or aureole .",
    "the aureole has a profile of an inverse - square law that extends out from the central part by a factor of 1000 in angular distance , and contains about 5% of the star s light .",
    "similar results are presented by several authors ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "even higher aureole energy fractions of @xmath46 are reported in some cases ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . here",

    "figure [ fig07 ] suggests that a range of @xmath8 = 0.16 - 2.0 mag could change the @xmath6 strength by a factor of 2 - 3 while keeping @xmath101 constant .",
    "it also indicates that the @xmath8 range alone can not explain the full range of the @xmath6 scatter .",
    "if the albedo becomes greater as the optical depth becomes smaller , then the full range of the @xmath6 scatter could be explained in terms of the optical depth effect coupled to variations in albedo .",
    "however , this case is not likely , because small - size dust grains , which have smaller albedo than large ones(e.g .",
    "@xcite ) , are expected in smaller optical depth regions according to the theory of grain growth .",
    "two smooth curves in figure [ fig06 ] are synthesized spectra for @xmath106 = 0.15 by @xcite , adopting the isrf spectrum by @xcite combined with a simple plane - parallel galaxy model and two dust models from @xcite and @xcite ( hereafter zda04 and wd01 models ) .",
    "the models underestimate @xmath6 by a factor of 2",
    ". there would be two possible explanations for this .",
    "one is a deficiency in uv photons compared to the assumed spectrum of the isrf ; the dust temperature is low and @xmath107 thus increases where the dust grains are illuminated by a small number of uv photons(see figures 9 and 10 in @xcite ) .",
    "the other is that the albedo is greater than assumed in the models , because figure [ fig07 ] and equation ( [ eq : appendix ] ) imply that the @xmath6 strength is doubled if @xmath101 increases by 20% ; for example , @xmath105 to be 0.8 instead of a standard milky way value of 0.67 at v @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , more large grains are needed than in the zda04 and wd01 models , because large grains are efficient scatters of light .         as a function of @xmath54 ) for the peak of 100  emission in the cloud .",
    "the legend for the points is the same as in figure [ fig06 ] . ]",
    "another possible cause of the large @xmath6 scatter is variations in dust temperature .",
    "higher dust temperature increases the intensity of the 100  emission and , as a consequence , it would decrease the @xmath6 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the resulting 100  radiation is @xmath108 at 18k @xcite .",
    "however the real situation is not so simple .",
    "the temperature of 100-emitting dust grains , i.e. large grains , is determined by the balance between incoming energy from the illuminating radiation to the grains and the outgoing infrared thermal energy .",
    "one can increase the temperature of the grains by increasing the uv component of the isrf while leaving the optical intensity of the isrf the same .",
    "that would leave the optical dgl intensity the same but increase the 100  intensity .",
    "however , if the optical intensity of the isrf changes , it also changes the intensity of the dgl .",
    "thus , the increment of @xmath6 , e.g the ratio of increment of the dgl and that of the 100  emission , depends intricately on the spectral energy distribution and the non - isotropy of the isrf .",
    "@xcite showed that the dust emissivity , which is measured from the ratio of far - ir optical depth to visual extinction @xmath109(far - ir)/@xmath8 , decreases as a function of dust temperature , and the higher temperature dust does not necessarily mean the higher surface brightness at 100 .",
    "they concluded that the emissivity variations are caused by the variations in the absorption cross section of dust in the far - ir , or the grain size distribution .    in our sample",
    ", we do not see any convincing correlation between @xmath6 and dust temperature @xmath110 as shown in figure [ fig09 ] .",
    "the plotted dust temperatures are taken from the @xmath14/dirbe temperature map .",
    "the @xmath111 dependence of the 100  intensity causes an increase by a factor of about 1.7 over a temperature range from 16k to 17.5k shown in the data of figure [ fig09 ] .",
    "however , the ratio of @xmath109(far - ir)/@xmath8 declines with increasing temperature , and the effective increase in @xmath54 ) would become lower than 1.7 .",
    "this may explain why the data of figure [ fig09 ] do not lead to any discernible trends . as a caveat",
    ", it should be noted that the @xmath14/dirbe temperature map is severely limited by the angular resolution of dirbe of @xmath11 1 degree .",
    "thus , this map is not capable of correctly reflecting the temperature variations across cloud structures with scales much smaller than the dirbe resolution .",
    "further exploration of the @xmath6 dependence on the dust temperature requires far - ir data with higher resolution such as those from the akari all sky survey .",
    "such analysis is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "another possible cause of the large @xmath6 scatter is the effect of the forward - scattering characteristic of dust grains .",
    "the isrf is non - isotropic because of the stellar concentration toward the galactic disk .",
    "the scattering efficiency in the direction towards the observer is coupled to this non - isotropy through the forward - scattering phase function of scattering grains .",
    "this effect is maximized for the geometric configuration explored by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the latitude dependence of surface brightness of a cloud at high latitude was studied , employing the @xcite approximation for the scattering phase function . in this model",
    ", it is assumed that a cloud is illuminated by an infinite homogeneous disk .",
    "the observer is located in the plane , and the cloud is located above the plane .",
    "the numerical results by @xcite show that the surface brightness of a cloud @xmath112 is written as @xmath113 where @xmath65 is the asymmetry factor of the phase function and @xmath25 the galactic latitude .",
    "for strong forward scattering , @xmath114 ; for isotropic scattering , @xmath115 .",
    "this equation shows that the brightness of the scattered light is significantly changed with the latitude of the cloud . adopting a typical asymmetry factor @xmath116 ,",
    "the intensity of the scattered light at @xmath117 is 2 - 3 times larger than that of at @xmath118 .",
    "this model assumes that all radiation sources , i.e. stars , are located just in a plane , however , this is not the case .",
    "in fact , the mean vertical height of high - latitude clouds is @xmath119 pc @xcite and that of the stellar disk is @xmath120 pc @xcite .",
    "thus , the geometry used in the model of @xcite is extreme",
    ". it would be more natural to assume that a significant portion of stars are located behind the high - latitude clouds .    to examine the effectiveness of the forward - scattering characteristic of dust grains , we present figure [ fig10 ] , illustrating @xmath6 as a function of galactic latitude @xmath121 ( _ upper panels _ ) and longitude @xmath122 ( _ lower panels _ ) . in upper panels",
    ", we may see a correlation between the @xmath6 and the galactic latitude @xmath121 in the blue range , but no correlation in the red range .",
    "there are no @xmath6 dependency on the longitude @xmath122 at all . for comparison , equation ( [ jura ] ) with @xmath123",
    "is plotted in upper panels of figure [ fig10 ] .",
    "the absolute value of the equation is determined by eye to fit the observed data .",
    "the @xmath6 variation in the blue range seems to be partly explained in terms of the forward - scattering .",
    "then , why are there no correlations in the red range ?",
    "a possible cause could be a difference in the distribution of blue stars ( i.e. , effective emitter of blue light ) and red stars ( i.e. , effective red light emitter ) .",
    "blue young stars are more concentrated towards the galactic plane than red old stars and the @xmath65 value at the blue range is greater than the red range in dust models ( e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the effect of the forward - directed scattering phase function would be more efficient in the blue range than in the red range .",
    "extended red emission ( ere ) is observed as an excess in the 5000 - 9000   spectral range in the ism .",
    "it is suggested that ere is the result of an interaction of far - uv photons with interstellar dust @xcite .",
    "ere is observed in reflection nebulae @xcite , hii regions @xcite , and planetary nebulae @xcite . in the diffuse ism , such as high latitude clouds ,",
    "some authors favor the presence of ere in the diffuse optical light ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , while others suggest the absence of ere ( @xcite ; @xcite ) based on broadband observations .",
    "the cloud observed by @xcite and @xcite is illuminated by the nearby star polaris ( f7 ib ) .",
    "the optical surface brightness of the cloud is dominated by scattered light of polaris , but this star is not blue enough to emit sufficient far - uv photons for ere excitation ( private communications with the anonymous referee ; see section 6.4 of @xcite for further discussion ) .",
    "thus , it would be natural for them to miss ere .",
    "carrying out spectroscopy of the diffuse optical light toward a high latitude cloud , @xcite claimed to detect ere peaking at 6000 , which is blue - shifted compared with 8000  for hii regions and 7000  for reflection nebulae and planetary nebulae . on the other hand ,",
    "the more recent spectroscopic study by @xcite can not find any evidence of ere .",
    "there is some confusion in the dgl models , which are sometimes used for the claim of ere detection ; ere is detected , if the observed diffuse optical light is redder than predicted by the model , and vice verse .",
    "here we introduce the @xmath79 value , which is a measure of the redness of the diffuse optical light .",
    "as indicated in table [ tab03 ] , measured @xmath79 values are typically @xmath124 .",
    "models by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite predict @xmath125 , which is bluer than the measured values @xmath126 , supporting the presence of ere in the diffuse optical light .",
    "in contrast , @xcite predicted @xmath127 , using the witt - petersohn dgl model(wp model ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , an advanced monte carlo multiple scattering model utilizing the actual galactic radiation field and realistic dust scattering properties . @xcite also predicted @xmath128 using their scattering dgl models(zda04 and wd01 )",
    ". these are consistent with the observed values without ere",
    ". however , the observed values deduced from @xmath12910/11 data from the high - latitude regions by @xcite are @xmath130 , which is higher than other observed values , and still redder than the models .",
    "it is emphasized that @xmath6 in this work on cloud mbm32 in figure [ fig06 ] has an excess at the @xmath10-band and favors ere in the diffuse optical light ; @xmath6 rises from b to v faster than the models , seems to peak around 6000  and decreases towards long wavelengths .",
    "such a characteristic is expected from the models in which scattered dgl is combined with ere .",
    "we have conducted _ b , g , v , _ and _ r_-band imaging in a @xmath131 field containing part of the high galactic latitude translucent cloud mbm32 , and correlated the intensity of the diffuse optical light @xmath1 with that of 100@xmath2 emission @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath54 ) ranges from 1.4 to 7.0 mjy sr@xmath12 in the field .",
    "a minimum @xmath4 analysis is applied to fit a linear function to the measured correlation and to derive the slope parameter @xmath6 of the best - fit linear function .    compiling a sample by combining our @xmath6 and published ones",
    ", we showed that the @xmath6 strength varies from cloud to cloud by a factor of 4 .",
    "we also found that @xmath6 decreases as @xmath3 increases in the sample . to incorporate this @xmath6 - @xmath3 relation",
    ", we proposed that a non - linear correlation including a negative quadratic term of @xmath7 be fitted to the measured correlation .",
    "we explored possible causes of the large @xmath6 scatter by examining the effects of the optical depth , dust albedo , dust temperature and the forward - scattering characteristic of dust grains coupled to the non - isotropic interstellar radiation field(isrf ) .",
    "the variation of optical depth , which is @xmath8 = 0.16 - 2.0 in the sample , can change @xmath6 by a factor of 2 - 3 while keeping the albedo , @xmath101 , constant .",
    "this indicates that the @xmath8 range alone can not explain the full range of the @xmath6 scatter .",
    "our finding of a correlation between the @xmath6 and galactic latitude @xmath121 in the blue range ( 0.43 - 0.48 ) would imply that there would be some contribution to the @xmath6 scatter from the effect of the forward - scattering characteristic of dust grains coupled to the non - isotropic interstellar radiation field(isrf ) .",
