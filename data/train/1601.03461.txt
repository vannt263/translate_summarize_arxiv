    "the expected increase in the growth rate of mobile data is driving the evolution of mobile communication technologies .",
    "the lte specification , which has been introduced by the 3gpp is one of the solutions for the increasing appeal of packet - based mobile broadband systems @xcite .",
    "it is intended as a system to be able to provide a significant improvement in throughput over the preceding mobile standards ( e.g. gsm , umts , hspa ) and support multiple classes of quality of service ( qos ) .    with the aim to efficiently support the current high variety of services , the efficient use of limited share bandwidth is essential .",
    "the purpose of effective scheduling strategies is crucial to meet the lte targets , inasmuch as selecting an appropriate scheduling scheme is not standardized by the 3gpp specification for lte @xcite , but it is left to the vendors as an implementation decision to adaptively configure and implement an appropriate algorithm according to the desired concerns of the system @xcite .",
    "however , typically , it is impossible to accomplish all intended goals at the same time @xcite .",
    "each factor can be supplied always at the cost of reducing another one .",
    "for example , scheduling algorithms aiming to optimize only spectral efficiency are unsuitable for dealing with guaranteed bit rate traffic @xcite . in this sense",
    ", the main challenge is designing an allocation strategy to create a trade - off among the system performance factors .",
    "therefore throughput - aware approaches must be used with qos - aware strategies to provide a good balance between multi - qos provisioning to support mixes of real - time and non - real - time traffic and system throughput maximization @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that , despite the network - wide control mechanisms to mitigate traffic overload @xcite , mobile data content overwhelms the available bandwidth for each node in many peak traffic times @xcite .",
    "based on this premise , it is clear that the overload state is an inevitable issue in lte mobile networks , and that the proposed scheduling algorithms must also be resistant to the unexpected traffic overload patterns .",
    "accordingly , in this paper the design of an optimal scheduling algorithm for lte downlink by considering the qos requirements specified for each application is addressed .",
    "we intend to clarify how the demand of the bearers in the application architecture should be accommodated by assigning the available radio resources such that , the application requirements and resource constraints in the network are satisfied without sacrificing the system throughput .    the strategy is based on the concept of optimization problems in which the resource allocation problem is formulated as a knapsack problem .",
    "this allows for quick and accurate solutions to find nearly optimal allocation decisions .",
    "thus , we propose a greedy heuristic approach as an efficient solution to this problem .",
    "in addition , by applying a ranking model to the bearers , the relative merits of various bearers demanding resource allocation are quantified .",
    "when this greedy - knapsack approach is applied in time - domain scheduling , it is shown to be effective in improving system performance and reliability while the network experiences a mix of normal and overload traffic .",
    "the performance evaluation is conducted in terms of average system throughput , delay and packet loss for guaranteed bit rate ( gbr ) and non - guaranteed bit rate ( non - gbr ) classes of services .",
    "in addition to the average throughput , fairness among voip bearers is evaluated as another effect of throughput - aware decision making for scheduling .",
    "this paper is organized into six sections including this introductory section .",
    "section 2 presents the main motivation for optimal greedy scheduling .",
    "it gives an overview of scheduling issues in lte networks as well as different solutions proposed to provide efficient resource allocation among user equipments ( ues ) and cites related works .",
    "section 3 describes the system model and provides the details of our proposed greedy - knapsack scheduling algorithm .",
    "the simulation process , simulation parameters and performance metrics are described in section 4 , while section 5 discusses the performance of the greedy - knapsack algorithm in respect of the simulation results .",
    "section 6 concludes the overall research study and outlines recommendations for future work .",
    "this section addresses three issues that are dealt with in this study , namely , lte performance targets , optimized scheduling and reliable scheduling in overload states .",
    "it also reviews various solutions proposed in lte literature to provide efficient , optimized and reliable downlink resource allocation among bearers from different classes of applications in lte networks .",
    "it is worth noting that the responsibility for providing scheduling performance targets is up to the implementation of the enodeb residing in the mac layer @xcite .",
    "the enodeb assigns each active user a fraction of the total system bandwidth to share available resources among them by using a multiple access technique .",
    "the lte downlink 3gpp adopts orthogonal frequency division multiple access ( ofdma ) as an access technique to accommodate user equipments with a wide variety of qos application requirements and in channel conditions @xcite .",
    "ofdma allows multiple access by allocating a disjoint selective collection of sub - carriers to each individual user to leverage multi - user diversity and provide high scalability and robustness @xcite .",
    "the lte radio resources are distributed in time and frequency domains .",
    "each ofdma frame comprises ten 1ms sub - frames in the time domain and a sub - channel of 12 consecutive same size sub - carriers that cover 180 khz of the frequency domain . the basic resource unit for mapping sub - carriers to active users",
    "is called the resource block ( rb ) .",
    "each rb spans over a 0.5 ms time extent and one sub - channel @xcite .    to decrease the complexity and increase the design flexibility ,",
    "the new sophisticated radio resource management mechanisms follow a two level framework @xcite . in these kinds of framework",
    "the resource allocation procedure is divided between the time domain ( td ) and frequency domain ( fd ) schedulers operating in independent ways .",
    "the td scheduler determines a priority list of users in each transmission time interval among those waiting for scheduling , and the fd scheduler is in charge of physically assigning frequency resources to the selected users in the time domain .",
    "the scheduling algorithm presented in this paper focuses on the time domain to provide efficient sharing of time resources among the candidate users .",
    "this algorithm can be integrated with most of the fd schedulers in the literature to exploit the provisioned spectrum resources efficiently .",
    "the concept of performance guarantee in network utilization can be expressed in terms of qos and throughput provisioning . in the field of cellular communication networks ,",
    "the term qos indicates a measure of how efficiently and reliably a network can fulfil a guaranteed level of satisfaction for its diverse services from real - time to non - real - time services .",
    "as the different services are susceptible to different measures of quality , a proper level of qos requirements needs to be guaranteed .",
    "several studies have conceived the concept of qos provisioning in lte networks @xcite .",
    "a qos - oriented scheduler for best effort and constant bit rate traffic was introduced in @xcite .",
    "prioritization of users is done using the common well - known blind equal throughput ( bet ) and proportional fair ( pf ) approaches in time domain .",
    "the bet and pf metrics are expressed as :    @xmath0)\\ ] ]    and@xmath1)/(r[n])\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the user index , @xmath3 $ ] is the wideband throughput expected for the user @xmath2 through available bandwidth and @xmath4 $ ] is the past average throughput of user @xmath2 , which is updated at every transmission time interval ( tti ) @xcite .",
    "the main focus of this method is on improving total throughput along with considering guaranteed bit rate measurements as the only one qos parameter .",
    "a flexible fairness and qos - oriented multi - stream scheduler is based on the two - stage ( time and frequency domains ) proportional fair scheduling principle described in @xcite for real - time video traffic .",
    "the multi - stream pf ( qos - mspf ) resource allocation algorithm considers the arrival rate and head of line packet delay to be qos constraints .",
    "eventually , this scheduler uses a metric , which is a combined function of delay , throughput and channel quality identifier ( cqi ) factors , as follows : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a function of qos delay factors , @xmath7 is a function of cqi indicating channel state information of each user , and @xmath8 is a factor of corresponding throughput calculation .",
    "this algorithm can not be considered to be a strong qos provisioning scheduler because it ignores other qos factors , such as the minimum data - rate requirements .",
    "the authors in @xcite applied a self - optimization method in response to the active changes in network conditions and traffic over time , and proposed an optimized - service aware ( osa ) scheduler . to simplify the complexity of the resource allocation procedure",
    ", it has been partitioned into three separate stages - qos classes identified classification , time domain , and frequency domain scheduling .",
    "the osa algorithm sorts each gbr bearer according to the head of line ( hol ) packet delay in the buffer of the related bearer , while the non - gbr bearer list is ordered according to the following priority metric :    @xmath9)/(\\theta[n])w_{qos}\\ ] ]    where @xmath10 $ ] is the normalized average channel condition estimate of bearer @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the qos weight .",
    "two created sorted candidate groups are passed through the fd scheduler to be assigned to the optimal spectrum .",
    "the fd scheduler allocates the best rb to the highest gbr priority bearer . after giving enough resources to all gbr bearers ,",
    "if any rb still remains , the fd scheduler assigns them to non - gbr bearers .",
    "the osa algorithm can be demonstrated to be unsuitable for dealing with bounded losses as another factor of qos support .",
    "we note that none of the aforementioned approaches offer any strict guarantees on all qos characteristics specified for different classes of qos , which plays a major role in end - user satisfaction .",
    "consequently , a generic ranking function has been proposed in @xcite to provide absolute delay and loss guarantees to gbr and non - gbr bearers .",
    "this scheme does not account for past throughput experienced by users .",
    "research shows that a lack of throughput awareness by schedulers when a specified level of qos is required will lead to the quality degradation of video and voip services even during the low traffic times of network .",
    "consequently , there is a need for a unique resource allocation mechanism for both qos and throughput gain to be employed in enodeb . in this research",
    ", we propose a ranking function , which is a combination of the influential parameters that can provide qos provisioning as well as throughput gain in one algorithm .",
    "the lte scheduler has to supply qos requirements of mobile communication and be adaptive to the channel quality fluctuations .",
    "hence , the complexity of the lte scheduling problem has been classified as a np - hard category @xcite",
    ". the scheduling job is becoming increasingly complex because it has to be performed in hard real time fashion .",
    "recently , to improve the performance of the proposed schemes , cross - layer formulations and several optimization tools , including game theory , have been adopted .",
    "nevertheless , many drawbacks that limit the application of state - of - the - art algorithms to practical contexts still hold , mainly due to the high computational complexity and the weak scalability of the proposed techniques , that often make real - time solutions intractable problems , as they also require a considerable amount of feedback information across the network nodes .    in @xcite",
    ", an linearized optimization model has been presented for multi - user scheduling in the context of lte downlink . however , obtaining an exact optimal scheduling solution remains very time - consuming .",
    "the authors in @xcite proposed near - optimal scheduling approaches based on the genetic algorithm ( ga ) and simulated annealing ( sa ) heuristic methods to solve the earlier formulated optimization problem of multi - user scheduling .",
    "they provided near - optimal solutions in terms of average total bit rate , without concern for the qos requirements , specified as loss and delay constraints .    in this respect ,",
    "we rely on heuristics @xcite to find solutions in a reasonable amount of time with low complexity . in @xcite , a knapsack optimization implementation",
    "is employed in response to the need for qos provisioning for lte downlink scheduling . in this method ,",
    "the lte resource allocation problem is formulated to a fractional knapsack problem by mapping their respective properties . in this method ,",
    "bearers are selected for scheduling according to their overall rank .",
    "however choosing the highest rank bearer without any concern for the extent of their required resources does not lead to optimal benefit .",
    "furthermore , other lte performance targets also need to be considered in resource allocation .",
    "accordingly , the central contribution of this paper involves the introduction and analysis of a new lte downlink resource allocation strategy with respect to a utility function to express allocation preferences and represent the optimal allocation solution as a greedy - knapsack algorithm .",
    "although both utility models @xcite and fractional knapsack resource allocation formulations are available in the literature @xcite , this work presents a new and significant solution to provide optimal trade - off between the performance targets .",
    "to optimize the various objectives of proportional fairness and maximize the average system throughput , subject to satisfying qos constraints on data rate , priority , packet loss and delay , the scheduling approach presented here is a bearer - level qos control approach .",
    "a bearer is established between the user equipment ( ue ) and packet data network gateway to indicate the application data flows within the evolved packet system .",
    "typically , a user may apply several applications having different qos requirements at the same time ( as a case in point , streaming a video whilst downloading a ftp file ) . in order to discriminate between these various services ,",
    "the qos characteristics have been standardized in 3gpp technical specifications , in nine quality channel indicator ( qci ) classes as listed in table [ table 1 ] .",
    "thus , every bearer is assigned to a distinc qci class and associated with an individual allocated and retention priority ( arp ) parameter @xcite .",
    "the arp parameter has no effect on scheduling decisions as it is used for call admission control to imply the importance of the bearer set up and modification request depending on the system resource availability .",
    "lllllp9 cm    qci & bearer type & priority &    [ cols= \" < \" , ]     [ table 3 ]    in this work , we evaluated the performance of the proposed greedy - knapsack algorithm in terms of the qos parameters and system average throughput per qos class .",
    "the qos analysis was made by measuring the correspondent qci s packet loss rate and packet delay budget .",
    "these metrics describe the user s perspective performance and are measured when there are various stochastic intervals of normal and overload states .",
    "in this research , we seek to solve the knapsack scheduling problem and optimize the total performance of the network by exploiting the greedy property of lte resource sharing . furthermore , a qos and throughput aware ranking function was included to deal with the challenging issue of give - and - take scheduling targets .",
    "to better conceive the obtained results , several graphs and tables were generated based on the simulation outputs .",

    "the greedy - knapsack algorithm shows a general throughput increase especially for qci classes 1 , 2 , 4 , 7 , 8 and 9 , compared to the knapsack algorithm .",
    "this increment is obtained thanks to the qos class - based ranking function combined with the time - domain normalized throughput ratio .",
    "it turned the multi - service resource allocation algorithm into an opportunistic scheduler , which provides system throughput improvement compared to the qos guarantee in traffic overload patterns .",
    "the greedy - knapsack algorithm tends to give higher priority to the bearers with higher potential of the wideband throughput when they are in superior quality of the channel state .",
    "furthermore , it seeks to give a relatively equal share of the resources to proportionally equalize the throughput of all users .",
    "in contrast , the knapsack and priority only schedulers have a qos - oriented allocation pattern , which is completely independent of the frequency domain setting ; therefore , the qos constraints are provided at the expense of the throughput . in the case of the priority only algorithm , a bearer having higher qci priority is resource allocated in advance .",
    "consequently , the biggest throughput rate improvement belongs to the lowest priority qci class 9 , with 109.2% raise .",
    "there is no significant variation of throughput for qci class 1 when using the three mentioned algorithms .",
    "they show the highest throughput performance around 5 mbps for voip bearers .",
    "we can justify this no - variation and maximum throughput because of the prominent factor of qci metrics , particularly the highest priority affected , in the bearers sorting pattern .        to illustrate the relative equal share of the resources ,",
    "we have evaluated the fairness of the voip bearers by computing the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of jain s fairness index during the simulation window time . as much as the effect of past",
    "experienced throughput awareness is more prominent for prioritizing the bearers with the same qos characteristics , and the voip traffic is the major volume of the existing wireless communication traffic the measure of fairness for the voip traffic is important in assessing how fair the system scheduling solution performs .",
    "based on fig .",
    "[ fig : fair ] we can deduce that the level of fairness was improved as the particular effect of the added normalized throughput metric .",
    "it indicates that greedy - knapsack achieves a good level of fairness ( jain s fairness index between 0.87 and 1.00 ) where , 60% of voip bearers receive less than or equal to 0.96 fairness index while for the case of knapsack scheduler in use , they receive less than or equal to 0.92 fairness index .      to study and compare the behaviour of the greedy - knapsack algorithm with the knapsack and priority only algorithms , figs .",
    "[ fig:2]-[fig:8 ] show the obtained numerical results for the loss and delay , which are defined as the influential qos factors in providing an optimal level of quality of experience ( qoe ) during the whole simulation time , including intervals of normal and overload states .    due to the fact that the entire quantity of traffic is greater than the available system bandwidth during the overload periods , the schedulers serve the bearers with the most emergency demand of resource to optimize the performance with a trade - off between the system optimization targets ; therefore , no scheduling algorithm would be optimal for all qci classes in overload periods .",
    "tables [ table 5 ] and [ table 6 ] show the improved percentage of the greedy - knapsack algorithm in terms of average loss and latency per class in comparison with the reference algorithms .",
    "as can be seen from these tables , greedy - knapsack algorithm provided a trade - off in terms of loss and delay among the gbr and non - gbr application classes .",

    "the difference between the greedy - knapsack scheduler and alternative schedulers increases .",
    "as can be seen from figs .",
    "[ fig:5]-[fig:7 ] , the greedy - knapsack algorithm shows a better level of qoe in terms of loss and latency over the qci classes 6 - 8 and slightly over qci class 9 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] ) , compared to the knapsack algorithm . for example , 90 % of the bearers from qci class 6 experience less than 12 ( mbps ) loss and 2200 ( ms ) delay over greedy - knapsack and less than 17(mbps ) loss and 3300 ( ms ) delay over the knapsack algorithm .",
    "this performance improvement is explained because the greedy - knapsack algorithm considers the quantity of packets from each application bearer waiting for scheduling in the bearer s queue .    as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:5 ] and [ fig:6 ] , the priority only algorithm provides a good service with small loss and delay to qci classes 6 and 7 , thus leaving a small quota of bandwidth for qci classes 8 and 9 , which is a weakness of this algorithm .",
    "it results in intensely high spikes of delay , especially in case of qci class 9 in which the bearer waits starving in overload periods and is not served ( fig .",
    "[ fig : d9 ] ) .",
    "the low priority bearers of qci 8 and 9 are the dominant traffic in the current internet browsing including a huge amount of data flows coming from the applications , such as web pages , email services , peer - to - peer file sharing and progressive video . regarding this issue ,",
    "the knapsack and greedy - knapsack algorithms provide an efficient service level , which is finely tuned between all qci classes 6 - 9 to handle the bandwidth sharing in the overload conditions of the network .",
    "in this paper , the problem of downlink multi - service scheduling for lte systems was addressed . in this context",
    ", we determined how the candidate users should be selected in each tti for scheduling , such that the service requirements and bandwidth constraints in the network are fulfilled , without sacrificing the throughput performance of the system .",
    "accordingly , a greedy approach proposed by exploiting the greedy property of the fractional knapsack problem to list an optimal set of users to efficiently share resources by multiple applications . ultimately , this approach provided an optimal solution to the lte resource allocation problem , formulated based on the fractional knapsack optimization problem . a throughput - aware class - based ranking function , included in the greedy - knapsack algorithm , was presented to provide a joint optimization of the throughput parameter and qos constraints to support mixes of gbr and non - gbr traffic .",
    "we compared the system throughput induced by the schedulers , packets delay , and packet loss rate of the bearers coming from different classes of qos under a mix of normal and overload traffic states .",
    "the simulation results showed that the proposed algorithm provided a flexible resource allocation strategy for different classes of qos with separable constraints , while reducing the loss and delay .",
    "moreover , the experienced data rate awareness of the proposed ranking function resulted in increasing throughput even for non - gbr classes of applications .",
    "the innovative solutions standardized for lte - advanced , such as carrier aggregation , can influence the design of the scheduling algorithms .",
    "therefore , it will be interesting to explore the greedy - knapsack formulation when the modulation and coding scheme constraint , and the component carriers assignment , are also considered to make the resource allocation strategy compatible with lte - advanced networks as well .",

    "<S> the long term evolution ( lte ) as a mobile broadband technology supports a wide domain of communication services with different requirements . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , scheduling of all flows from various applications in overload states in which the requested amount of bandwidth exceeds the limited available spectrum resources is a challenging issue . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , in this paper , a greedy algorithm is presented to evaluate user candidates which are waiting for scheduling and select an optimal set of the users to maximize system performance , without exceeding available bandwidth capacity . </S>",
    "<S> the greedy - knapsack algorithm is defined as an optimal solution to the resource allocation problem , formulated based on the fractional knapsack problem . a compromise between throughput and qos provisioning </S>",
    "<S> is obtained by proposing a class - based ranking function , which is a combination of throughput and qos related parameters defined for each application . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation results show that the proposed method provides high performance in terms of throughput , loss and delay for different classes of qos over the existing ones , especially under overload traffic . </S>"
