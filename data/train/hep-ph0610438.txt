    "in the last few years , various indications appeared that the quark - gluon plasma is not a weakly coupled system even up to temperatures of the order of a few times the deconfinement one , @xmath0 .",
    "for instance , rhic data point to a nearly perfect - fluid type behavior of the plasma at such temperatures , which is characterized by the shear viscosity to the entropy - density ratio of the order of 0.1 , whereas the values for this ratio predicted by perturbative qcd are larger than 1 .",
    "besides experimental data , a lot of information on the nonperturbative properties of the plasma comes from the lattice . among the recent results obtained there and calling for a theoretical explanation ,",
    "are the anomalously large ( from the perturbation theory standpoint ) maxima of the entropy and internal energy of the static quark - antiquark pair in unquenched qcd around @xmath0  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this work is aimed at a description of these data below @xmath0 .",
    "the strategy of our analysis is the following . in the next section , we will determine @xmath0 and the effective string tension @xmath1 in the quenched su(@xmath2 ) qcd within the so - called gluon - chain model .",
    "in section  3 , with the use of @xmath1 adjusted to the unquenched ( @xmath3)-case , we will calculate , within the relativistic quark model , the partition function of heavy - light mesons and baryons .",
    "entropy and internal energy stemming from this partition function will further be compared to the corresponding lattice data , and in the summary section conclusions will be drawn .",
    "it is generally accepted that the @xmath4-string , which sweeps out the flat surface of the corresponding wilson loop , is produced by soft ( stochastic background ) gluonic fields . on top of those ,",
    "fluctuations of the gauge field exist , which lead to string vibrations .",
    "these fluctuations are called valence gluons , and the @xmath4-string passing through one such gluon is called hybrid . at",
    "asymptotically large @xmath4-separations of interest , one has a string passing through numerous valence gluons , which we will call gluon chain .",
    "further , when one starts heating the system , at low temperatures the free energy of one string bit between two nearest gluons in the chain , being a constant , exceeds thermal mass of a gluon , which grows with @xmath5 linearly from zero on .",
    "the motion of gluons at low temperatures is therefore guided by the string ",
    "they move collectively and do not affect string s dynamics .",
    "however , at a certain temperature @xmath6 smaller than @xmath0 , the gluon s thermal mass becomes larger than the free energy of one string bit . from this temperature on , the system looks totally different , since gluons from the string s standpoint are now ( nearly ) static",
    ". therefore , at @xmath7 , a gluon chain is nothing but a sequence of static nodes with adjoint charges , connected by independently fluctuating string bits . at the moment of formation of such a chain ,",
    "its end - point originating from the heavy @xmath8 performs a random walk towards @xmath9 over the lattice of static nodes .",
    "the entropy of such a random walk turns out to be large , namely proportional to its length , and eventually leads to the deconfinement phase transition in this model .",
    "the reason is that color may alter from one node to another , i.e. every string bit may transport each of the @xmath2 colors .",
    "the total number of states of the gluon chain is therefore @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is its length and @xmath12 is the length of one bit .",
    "taking into account that the full free energy is the sum of the usual linear potential and the free energy of the random walk , we have for the effective string tension : @xmath13 where @xmath14 @xmath15\\ ] ] is the partition function of the random walk . here ,",
    "@xmath16 , @xmath17 is the zero - temperature string tension , @xmath18 is the schwinger proper time , and @xmath19 is the number of a matsubara mode .",
    "this formula takes into account the confining potential between the end - point of the walk and its starting point ( chosen at the origin ) , as well as the entropy factor discussed above . at asymptotically",
    "large @xmath20 s of interest , only the contribution of the ( @xmath21)-term is essential , and we obtain @xmath22 @xmath23.\\ ] ] an estimate for @xmath0 stems from the condition that the argument of the first square root vanishes : @xmath24 equating @xmath0 to the modern @xmath25 lattice value  @xcite , 270 mev , we obtain an effective length of one string bit @xmath26 .",
    "this is larger than the minimal possible value of this quantity , @xmath27  the so - called vacuum correlation length  @xcite , which defines the onset of a string - bit formation .",
    "the temperature @xmath6 , below which the lattice of valence gluons does not exist , can be defined from the condition @xmath28 , which yields @xmath29 an important finding of this model is the behavior @xmath30 it is the same as the one which follows from the nambu - goto model for the two - point correlation function of polyakov loops  @xcite .",
    "let us finally consider the limiting case when string bits can not alter color , i.e. one should formally set in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) @xmath31 , that yields @xmath32 determining in this case @xmath6 directly from the equality of the gluon s thermal mass in qcd to the free energy of one string bit , we have @xmath33 setting for an estimate @xmath27 , @xmath34 , we obtain still reasonable values @xmath35 , @xmath36 . however , the fundamental difference of this limiting case from the realistic one , @xmath37 , is that here @xmath38 at @xmath39 .",
    "such type of the critical behavior characterizes the 2d ising model , which by no means can be realized in the 4d quenched su(@xmath2 ) qcd .",
    "the same linear fall - off of @xmath1 with @xmath40 one finds also in the hagedorn phase transition and in the deconfinement scenario based on the condensation of long closed strings  @xcite .",
    "it is a mere consequence of the formula @xmath41 at @xmath42 .",
    "let us now consider the unquenched case , where , at a certain distance , the @xmath4-string breaks due to the production of a light @xmath43-pair .",
    "the subsequent hadronization process leads to the formation of heavy - light mesons ( @xmath44 ) and heavy - light - light baryons ( @xmath45 ) , as well as their antiparticles . we will consider the ( @xmath46)-case , with light @xmath47- and @xmath48-quarks , and use the value @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "equation  ( [ 2 ] ) then yields an effective value of @xmath50 , which should now be used in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) to determine @xmath1 . then , for a heavy - light meson , the hamiltonian of the relativistic quark model reads @xmath51 here , @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the heavy - antiquark mass , whereas @xmath54 is the constituent mass of a light quark , @xmath55 .",
    "the subtraction of @xmath56 in @xmath57 is known to be important to reach an agreement between the predictions of the relativistic quark model to the phenomenology of meson spectroscopy  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "an additional correction , @xmath58 , is needed to obey the normalization condition @xmath59 at @xmath60 . here",
    ", @xmath61 is the resulting free energy of two noninteracting mesons , @xmath62 is the @xmath63-meson mass , @xmath64 is the @xmath65-quark mass .",
    "further , the square root in the relativistic kinetic energy can be disentangled by using the integration over an auxiliary parameter : @xmath66 @xmath67 one then arrives at a 3d schrdinger equation of the form @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are positive constants of dimension @xmath71 $ ] and @xmath72 ^ 2 $ ] , respectively .",
    "its eigenenergies have the form  @xcite @xmath73 where @xmath74 s are positive numbers with @xmath75 .",
    "further strategy for the calculation of the partition function of a meson  @xcite consists of accounting for its ground state exactly and modeling its higher eigenenergies by those of a 3d harmonic oscillator with the frequency @xmath76 then , because of the degeneracy factor @xmath77 for the oscillator , we have @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80.\\ ] ] the free energy of two noninteracting mesons reads @xmath81 , where the factor 4 is a product of two flavors and two spin states of the mesons ( which are antiparticles of each other )",
    ". doing the sum over @xmath19 analytically , we arrive at the following result : @xmath82 @xmath83.\\ ] ] the remaining @xmath84-integration has been done numerically .",
    "the resulting value of the parameter @xmath85 is 0.344 .",
    "entropy and internal energy can further be calculated by the standard formulae @xmath86 , @xmath87 .",
    "note that , when calculating the entropy , the derivative @xmath88 should not act on the hamiltonian in the partition function .",
    "similarly , one can treat @xmath89-baryons , whose hamiltonian reads @xmath90 here , we have approximated the position of the baryon string - junction point by the position of @xmath8 , that is legitimate due to the heaviness of @xmath8 .",
    "the value of the parameter @xmath85 , at which the free energy of a baryon goes to @xmath91 at @xmath60 , is 0.393 . here",
    ", @xmath92 is the mass of the @xmath93-baryon . in the figures , we plot the entropy and the internal energy of mesons together with baryons , at the averaged value @xmath94 . in the same figures , we plot the corresponding lattice data for the @xmath4-pair  @xcite .",
    "in this work , we have analytically addressed thermodynamics of the static @xmath4-pair below the deconfinement phase transition , in quenched and unquenched qcd . in the quenched su(@xmath2)-case , within the so - called gluon - chain model",
    ", we have derived an effective temperature - dependent string tension . with this string tension adjusted to the unquenched ( @xmath3)-case",
    ", we have calculated the entropies and internal energies of heavy - light mesons and baryons . in general , the results obtained are in a good agreement with the corresponding recent lattice data for the same quantities .",
    "our analysis shows also that the entropy and the internal energy of heavy - light mesons alone are not enough to reproduce correctly the lattice data .",
