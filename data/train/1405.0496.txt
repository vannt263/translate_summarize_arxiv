    "massive star formation is a phenomenon of fundamental importance in astrophysics yet a detailed understanding of it has been elusive @xcite .",
    "the present state of theory and numerical simulation research fall into two major categories of processes : `` core accretion '' and `` competitive accretion '' , as recently reviewed by @xcite . in the core accretion scenario , massive stars ( like low - mass stars )",
    "are formed via the collapse of self - gravitating , centrally condensed cores .",
    "these cores are discrete structures within the larger - scale molecular cloud , and each core constitutes the mass reservoir for a single star or small multiple system . as a result ,",
    "core mass maps directly to stellar mass , and the core mass function ( cmf ) maps to the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in contrast , competitive accretion models are intrinsically models of star cluster formation . fragmentation in a cluster - scale gas clump produces many low - mass protostars , which then accrete ( competitively ) from the large - scale gas reservoir . in this picture , massive stars _",
    "must _ form in a cluster environment , and massive stars and their surrounding clusters must form simultaneously ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "there are several significant observational constraints that these theories must face .",
    "first , there is mass segregation  the fact that the most massive members of young clusters are concentrated in the center ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it remains unclear whether this property is primordial or a result of dynamical evolution .",
    "@xmath14-body simulations of star clusters have shown that it is common to form compact groupings of massive stars ( i.e. trapezium - like systems ) near the center of the cluster in as little as one free - fall time , particularly when there is initial substructure @xcite .",
    "observational studies of young clusters caught early in the act of forming are critical to address the origin of mass segregation .",
    "second , there is the correlation between the mass of the most massive star and the number of cluster members @xcite .",
    "an ensuing question is whether the high - mass and low - mass members of clusters form at the same time .",
    "perhaps the only way to answer this question is to search for actively forming low - mass protostars amidst their high - mass counterparts . toward this end , the past decade of advances in",
    "( sub)millimeter interferometry has enabled the identification of proto - trapezium - like systems , termed `` protoclusters '' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which four or more compact millimeter continuum sources exist within a projected diameter of 10000  au . in many cases ,",
    "the protocluster members present a striking diversity in star formation indicators  including the presence or absence of h@xmath1o masers , hot core line emission , and free - free emission  providing strong evidence that closely neighboring objects can exist in different evolutionary stages of formation @xcite . at last count of the literature ,",
    "half of these massive cores studied at @xmath15  au resolution were resolved into four or more millimeter sources @xcite .",
    "these results emphasize the possibility of interaction between massive protostars , as well as their probable impact on low - mass protostars forming in their midst .",
    "furthermore , given the deeply embedded nature of protoclusters , sensitive high dynamic range millimeter and centimeter imaging will be needed to obtain an accurate census of their low - mass membership .",
    "a third observational constraint on theory is the tentative yet growing evidence for massive keplerian accretion disks around massive protostars",
    ". discovered through subarcsecond angular resolution imaging , there is a steadily increasing number of massive disk candidates around central stars of varying mass @xmath16 .",
    "examples of disk candidates with an enclosed mass of @xmath17  @xmath11 include iras  20126 + 4104 , iras  18360 - 0537 , and orion kl source i @xcite .",
    "larger scale structures ( toroids ) of diameter several thousand au have also been reported which may encompass either an o - type protostar or a cluster of massive protostars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are also cases of apparent sub - keplerian rotation ( afgl2591-vla3 : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as of a lack of keplerian rotation signatures on 500  au scales ( ngc7538  irs1 : * ? ? ?",
    "most of the candidate disks show a strong bipolar molecular outflow perpendicular to the disk plane , analogous to low - mass protostellar disk / outflow systems .",
    "it is important to note that the presence of such disks does not immediately favor either the core accretion or competitive accretion model , as they are expected to exist under both scenarios .",
    "however , as our knowledge of the massive disk population grows , both theories are certain to face new challenges .    to further explore the protostellar population of massive protoclusters ,",
    "we have been pursuing detailed observations of the nearby examples in ngc  6334 , a region containing multiple sites of high mass star formation @xcite . a recent deep near- and",
    "mid - infrared survey revealed over 2200 young stellar object ( yso ) candidates , and subsequent estimates of the star formation rate suggest that it may be undergoing a `` mini - starburst '' event @xcite . at the northeastern end of the region ,",
    "the deeply - embedded source `` i(n ) '' was first identified at 1  mm by @xcite and later detected at 400  by @xcite , who estimated a size of 50 .",
    "single - dish observations of high velocity sio emission indicated significant outflow activity at this location @xcite .",
    "our initial sma observations of ngc  6334  i(n )  at @xmath18 resolution resolved a trapezium - like protocluster of seven compact millimeter continuum sources within a projected diameter of 0.1  pc @xcite .",
    "as revealed by the millimeter spectral line data @xcite , the brightest three continuum sources ( sma  1 , sma  2 , and sma  4 ) are the origin of the hot core line emission seen in the many single - dish molecular line observations of this source @xcite .",
    "hot nh@xmath5 was resolved by 1.5 resolution australia telescope compact array ( atca ) observations of the ( 5,5 ) and ( 6,6 ) lines , which peak toward sma  1 @xcite .",
    "the profile of the ( 6,6 ) line showed a double peak separated by @xmath194  km  s@xmath9 , which was interpreted as possibly tracing a rotating circum - protostellar disk @xcite . with similar angular resolution",
    ", @xcite detected a comparable velocity gradient toward sma  1 in a few other hot core molecules .",
    "however , karl g. jansky very large array ( vla ) 7  mm continuum observations with a 0.5 beam resolved sma  1 into multiple components @xcite , making the larger - scale velocity gradient difficult to interpret .",
    "the ngc  6334  i(n ) millimeter protocluster is embedded in a region that is remarkably dim in the mid - infrared _ spitzer _ images , and has the characteristics of an infrared dark cloud ( irdc ) . to provide an overview , figure  [ fig0 ] reprises the millimeter and infrared continuum imaging results from @xcite .",
    "despite the millimeter multiplicity , we identified only some extended 4.5   emission associated with the bipolar outflows from sma  1 , 4 and 6 , and a single 24   point source near sma  4 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , our vla detection of copious amounts of 44  ghz class i ch@xmath5oh  maser emission to the southeast of the compact millimeter continuum sources is indicative of outflow activity @xcite , specifically in the area surrounding the single - dish ( sub)millimeter continuum source sm2 @xcite .",
    "similarly , our vla h@xmath1o  maser observations revealed 11 locations of emission , only 8 of which were associated with the known compact millimeter continuum sources , suggesting the presence of additional young stellar objects @xcite .    in this paper , we present new sub - arcsecond sma 1.3  mm , 0.87  mm and vla 6  cm imaging that indeed reveals significant further multiplicity in this protocluster , as well as the detailed kinematics of the hot cores and complex spectral energy distributions .",

    "[ obs ] , while   3 and   4 present our key results and discussion , respectively . for",
    "the distance to ngc  6334  i(n ) , we adopt 1.3 kpc based on recent h@xmath1o maser parallax studies : @xmath20  kpc @xcite and @xmath21  kpc @xcite . in the past ,",
    "the most commonly used value was 1.7 kpc from photometric estimates for the ngc  6334 region @xcite , implying a reduction by a factor of 1.7 for derived quantities based on the distance squared , such as mass and luminosity .",
    "for example , the total luminosity of ngc  6334  i(n ) as measured by @xcite is now @xmath22  @xmath23 with this revised distance .",
    "the details of the sma 1.3  mm and 0.87  mm observations and the nrao vla 6  cm observations are summarized in table  [ smaobs ] .",
    "the very extended ( henceforth , vex ) 1.3  mm sma data were calibrated in miriad @xcite , then exported to casa @xcite where the continuum was subtracted to create a line - only vex dataset .",
    "the continuum is then composed of the line - free portions of the dataset .",
    "self - calibration was performed on the continuum data , and solutions were transferred to the line data .",
    "line cubes were generated with a channel spacing of 1.1  km  s@xmath9 and robust weighting of 1.0 , with the exception of the 218.44 and 229.76 ghz class i methanol maser transitions which were imaged with robust weighting of 0.0 .",
    "the flux calibration is based on titan , ceres , and sma flux monitoring of the observed quasars and is estimated to be accurate to within 20% .",
    "the same procedure was also followed for the vex 0.87  mm data .",
    "unfortunately , the observing conditions for the 0.87  mm data were significantly worse than for the 1.3  mm data in terms of higher winds and more variable opacity , leading to greater phase instability .",
    "as a result , the 0.87  mm spectral line cubes are too noisy to be useful .",
    "two 1.3  mm continuum images were constructed : ( 1 ) to maximize the continuum sensitivity and minimize artifacts from resolved out structure , the vex 1.3  mm continuum data were combined with the extended configuration ( henceforth , ext ) continuum data presented in @xcite and @xcite and imaged with robust weighting of 0.5 . note that the ext 1.3  mm data only cover a portion of the spectral coverage of the vex data so no such combination was possible for the line data . the relative weight of the individual visibilities between the two configurations is such that the angular resolution of the combination is similar to that of the vex data alone .",
    "this `` ext+vex '' continuum image was used to identify and characterize the 1.3  mm dust continuum sources ; it is not sensitive to smooth structures larger than about @xmath24 .",
    "( 2 ) in an effort to better match the uv - coverage of the vex 0.87  mm data , the line - free portions of the vex 1.3  mm data were imaged with uv - spacings @xmath25k@xmath26 and robust=0 weighting .",
    "this image is henceforth termed the `` vex - uv '' 1.3  mm continuum image .",
    "the 0.87  mm continuum image was also created two ways , both using robust weighting of 1.0 : ( 1 ) a version using all of the data to obtain good angular resolution and sensitivity ; and ( 2 ) a version with a 300k@xmath26 uv - taper to better match the vex 1.3  mm data , which was then subsequently convolved to the same resolution as the vex - uv 1.3  mm continuum image .",
    "this uv - tapered and convolved image was used to determine the 0.87  mm dust continuum properties .",
    "the 0.87  mm images are not sensitive to smooth structures larger than about @xmath27 .",
    "all measurements from all images were obtained from versions that had been corrected for the primary beam response .",
    "the vla data were calibrated in casa with scripts based on the vla pipeline .",
    "imaging and self - calibration were performed manually in casa .",
    "the flux calibration accuracy is estimated to be 10% . due to the large primary beam ( nearly @xmath28 )",
    ", the vla 6  cm data include the bright ultracompact hii region ngc  6334  f as well as the 45-diameter hii region ngc  6334  e @xcite , which are both located south of the field of interest .",
    "we thus imaged a large field ( @xmath29 pixels ) containing these objects in order to minimize the confusion toward ngc  6334  i(n ) . comparing the new 6  cm jvla data to the 1.3  cm and 7  mm vla data presented in ( *",

    "2007 ) , we found a @xmath30 disagreement in the astrometry between the old and new data .",
    "the most likely culprit was the phase calibrator used in the older vla observations j1720 - 358 ( b1717 - 358 ) .",
    "we alerted both vla and alma to our suspicion , which led to an alma calibration observation of j1720 - 358 using the nearby vlba calibrator j1717 - 3342 @xcite at band 3 ( 92 ghz ) as the reference source with 24 antennas ( oct .",
    "29 , 2013 , execution blocks : uid://a002/x70c186/x12 , x25 , and x4a ) . as a result of these observations ,",
    "the alma calibrator database has been updated with a revised position of 17:20:21.798@xmath100.030 , -35:52:48.128@xmath100.010 ( a correction of 0.43 , as of this writing the vla calibrator database has not yet been updated ) .",
    "we have used this new information to correct the astrometry of the 1.3  cm and 7  mm images used in this paper .",
    "we note that our h@xmath1o maser observations used j1717 - 3342 as the phase calibrator @xcite and thus do not require correction .",
    "the 1.3  mm ext+vex image of the continuum emission is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "all of the seven previously - identified millimeter sources @xcite are detected , with the exception of one of the fainter , more extended sources ( sma  7 ) , whose emission is apparently resolved out by the longer baselines employed in these observations .",
    "we detect many new compact sources in the surrounding field , primarily because the rms noise achieved is nearly 4 times better than @xcite , and the higher angular resolution leads to a lower confusion limit . due to the limited size of the sma primary beam ,",
    "the rms noise in the image corrected for primary beam response increases as a function of angular radius from the phase center .",
    "therefore , we have established our detection threshold corresponding to @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the rms noise measured in an annulus @xmath33 .",
    "we defined four annuli corresponding to the following levels in the casa sensitivity image ( which for a single pointing observation is simply the image of the primary beam response ) : 80%100% , 60%80% , 40%60% , and 20%40% , for which we measured @xmath32 values of 2.2 , 2.5 , 3.4 and 5.4  mjy  beam@xmath9 .",
    "the area of the image above the 20% sensitivity level corresponds to 5500 times the area of the synthesized beam .",
    "therefore , we chose @xmath34 because the expected number of false @xmath35 `` peaks '' is only 0.019 .",
    "( for @xmath36 , the value is 0.17 which we considered to be too close to 1 false positive . ) with our @xmath37 criterion , we identify 24 sources , 16 of which are new ( table  [ contsources ] ) , and two of which ( sma  20 and 18 ) correspond to two of the brightest h@xmath1o  maser components ( c1 and c2 , respectively ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "all of the new sources , starting with sma  8 , are numbered in order of increasing right ascension .",
    "the majority of new sources are found in the southern half of the sma primary beam , consistent with the area of extended dust emission seen in the single dish 0.45  mm image ( see figs  1 and 2 ) .",
    "sma  18 coincides with the single - dish source sm2 to within the single - dish position uncertainty @xcite .",
    "we used the casa imfit task to fit each source with a two - dimensional gaussian to find the peak position and integrated flux density and attempt to find the deconvolved size . for 9 of the 24 sources ,",
    "the fitted size was well constrained in both the major and minor axes , and we can compute the brightness temperature ( a lower limit to the physical temperature ) . for 11 sources ,",
    "the minor axis was not well constrained , and the geometric mean of the major and minor axes of the fitted gaussian was less than that of the synthesized beam ( 0.5 ) .",
    "four sources were consistent with a point source in both axes . for the latter two cases , we assign 0.5 as an upper limit to the size and use this to compute a lower limit to the brightness temperature . with the exception of the 24   source near sma  4 , which likely traces hot dust in the walls of the cavity formed by the outflow from that source ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , none of the millimeter continuum sources have counterparts in the mid - infrared _ spitzer _ images @xcite .",
    "the vla 6  cm image ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) shows two previously known 6  cm point sources , associated with sma  1 and sma  4 @xcite , plus two new sources that are not associated with 1.3  mm emission .",
    "all four sources are consistent with unresolved compact sources with sizes @xmath38 . their positions and flux densities are listed in table  [ cmcontsources ] .",
    "one of the new sources coincides within 0.054 ( 70  au ) with the centroid of h@xmath1o maser component c4 @xcite , hence we call it h@xmath1o - c4 .",
    "the other new source is located @xmath3930 ( 0.2  pc ) south of sma  1 . because it is not coincident with any maser or 1.3  mm source",
    ", we call this source vla  2 in order to distinguish it from both the 1.3  cm source vla - k1 reported by @xcite ( outside the sma field of view ) and the 7  mm source vla  3 reported by @xcite ( which was named for its proximity to sma  3 and yet independent nature )",
    ".    the central portion of the ngc  6334  i(n ) protocluster is shown in figure  [ sma1zoom ] .",
    "the 1.3  mm emission from sma  1 has been clearly resolved into three components ( a , b+d , and c ) , which are composed of the four sources previously identified at 7  mm . in addition , the east / west extension of sma  1b at 1.3  mm is consistent with the presence of the fourth 7  mm component ( sma  1d ) .",
    "both sma  1b and sma  1d are detected at 1.3  cm and 7  mm while only sma  1b is detected at 6  cm . revised positions of the 1.3  cm and 7  mm counterparts based on the corrected astrometry of those images are given in table  [ cmpositions ] . with the new astrometry",
    ", there is now very good agreement between the vla and sma continuum contours for the primary millimeter sources ( sma  1b+d , 4 , and 6 ) .",
    "the angular separation between sma  1b and 1d in the 7  mm image is 0.45 ( 590  au ) at a position angle of -67 ( east of north ) .",
    "the area surrounding sma  6 is shown in figure  [ sma6zoom ] .",
    "the peaks of the 7  mm , 1.3  mm and 0.87  mm emission are in good agreement .",
    "there is an extended ridge of 1.3  mm emission to the southwest , part of which may arise from a distinct source .",
    "however , because it is not clearly separated from sma  6 and there is no compact counterpart at any other wavelength , we have not identified this ridge as a separate object .      a further zoomed view of the sma  1b+d region",
    "is shown in figure  [ sma1bd]a , b in 1.3  mm and 0.87  mm continuum , along with the h@xmath1o maser positions observed with a beam of @xmath40 at p.a.=+7 @xcite and the first moment of the ch@xmath5cn @xmath6=1211 , @xmath41=7 transition . with higher resolution",
    "than the 1.3  mm vex image , the 0.87  mm image clearly indicates that sma  1d is a source of submillimeter emission separate from sma  1b .",
    "further evidence that these are distinct sources comes from the h@xmath1o maser positions : the vast majority are coincident with sma  1b while none are seen toward sma  1d ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the position angle of the spatial extent of the h@xmath1o masers is somewhat inclined to that of the large - scale bipolar outflow axis measured in sio 54 @xcite .",

    "* ) in terms of spatial extent ( @xmath19500  au ) and the apparent overlap of widely disparate velocities . similar to the h@xmath1o emission , the ch@xmath5cn emission is centered on sma  1b ( see   [ hotcore ] ) , with no measurable emission coming from sma  1d .    in an attempt to apportion the 1.3  mm continuum flux density between sma  1b and 1d ,",
    "we fit a single two - dimensional gaussian to sma  1b in the 1.3  mm vex - uv continuum image .",
    "the residual image showed a weak source of unresolved emission coincident with the 7  mm and 1.3  cm source sma  1d . to estimate the flux density of this source",
    ", we fit the residual image with a single gaussian , which yielded a point source of @xmath42  mjy at the j2000 position : 17:20:55.23@xmath100.07 , -35:45:04.14 @xmath10 0.07 .",
    "the angular separation of this position from sma  1b is 0.56@xmath100.04 at position angle -69@xmath1010 , in good agreement with the 7  mm separation between sma  1b and 1d .",
    "finally , we estimate the flux density of sma  1b alone to be the joint flux density of sma  1b+d from table  [ contsources ] minus the value for sma  1d , or @xmath43  jy . a similar procedure",
    "was then performed on the 0.87  mm image , yielding a flux density of @xmath44  mjy for sma  1d .",
    "eight of the 1.3  mm sources are detected in the uv - tapered 0.87  mm image .",
    "note that 10 of the 16 non - detected sources ( including vla  2 ) lie beyond the one - third sensitivity radius of the primary beam , where the @xmath37 limit is @xmath45  jy  beam@xmath9 . using this image , the fitted positions , flux densities , and sizes",
    "are listed in table  [ contsourcesband7 ] .",
    "we caution that the uv - tapered 0.87  mm image is still not sensitive to the largest angular scales that the 1.3  mm ext+vex image contains .",
    "therefore , the 0.87  mm flux densities should be taken as lower limits for those sources having 1.3  mm fitted sizes significantly larger than @xmath46 , particularly those located in the complicated central cluster . for the 1.3  mm sources smaller than @xmath46 and located away from the central cluster ( including sma  13 and sma  15 ) , the 0.87  mm measurements are unlikely to suffer from missing flux and may be considered to be accurate .",
    "in our sma 1.3  mm data cubes , sma  1b , sma  2 and sma  4 all show copious hot core line emission , as do sma  6 , sma  15 , and sma  18 to a lesser extent . at the current sensitivity ,",
    "1.3  mm spectral line emission is not detected toward any of the other cores .",
    "the spectral line emission is dominated by spatially compact emission from complex molecules .",
    "indeed , most of the more abundant species that exhibited outflow emission ( e.g. co , @xmath47co , sio , dcn , etc . ) in the lower resolution sma data presented in @xcite are mostly resolved out in the very extended configuration data . as a result ,",
    "the channels with these molecules have significantly higher noise ( by factors of 3 - 10 ) due to imaging artifacts caused by the lack of short spacing information .",
    "from the 8 ghz of available 1.3 mm spectral bandwidth we identified for detailed analysis 12 transitions from 9 different chemical species that are representative of the range of line emission morphologies , kinematics , and line excitation temperatures detected in these data , and furthermore do not suffer significant line blending ( see table  [ linelist ] for more details ) .",
    "first moment images of these transitions toward the central region of the cluster are shown in figure  [ moments ] , where the field of view is the same as figure  [ sma1zoom ] .",
    "the parent cube was made with briggs weighting and a robust parameter of 1.0 .",
    "details of the transitions shown are provided in table  [ linelist ] , including their rest frequencies , excitation energies , and integrated intensities .",
    "the first striking feature in the images is the velocity gradient across the central 0.8 ( 1000  au ) of sma  1b , which is seen consistently in all transitions .",
    "the orientation and magnitude of the velocity gradient is comparable to that seen at @xmath192 angular resolution @xcite . in the lower energy lines such as hc@xmath5n and ocs , the emission and its accompanying gradient also extend somewhat to the northeast toward sma  1c . a zoomed view of the ch@xmath5cn @xmath41=7 transition is shown in figure  [ sma1bd]b .",
    "the magnitude of the gradient ranges from 3 to 5 km  s@xmath9/arcsec , with the largest values seen in the lines of ch@xmath5oh and ch@xmath5ocho .",
    "the position angle of the gradient was measured in each transition by viewing the data cube in casa , marking the ra / dec centroid of the emission in the outer velocity channels , and computing the corresponding slope .",
    "the median and standard deviation of the position angle taken over all the transitions is -52@xmath105 .",
    "sma  2 and sma  4 also show compact emission , but in only 9 or 10 of the 12 transitions , respectively .",
    "the differences in detections indicate differences in both chemistry ( hc@xmath5n being detected in sma  4 but not sma  2 ) and excitation conditions ( sma  2 being more extended in the lower energy transitions ) .",
    "also , the central velocity of the emission in sma  1b differs by several km  s@xmath9 from the emission seen toward sma  2 and sma  4 , indicating a significant velocity dispersion in this protocluster .",
    "to better quantify the characteristics of the line emission and estimate the gas physical conditions , we extracted the @xmath6=1211 ch@xmath5cn spectra at the peak positions of all the continuum sources in table  [ contsources ] .",
    "only 6 sources show detectable emission ; in particular , there is no sign of emission from sma  1c or 1d .",
    "we used the cassis package to perform a local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) model fit to the ch@xmath5cn  and ch@xmath48cn  ladders , which provide a good measurement of gas temperature in hot cores ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we used the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) @xmath50 minimization option , which is far more cpu time - efficient and tractable than a uniform grid search . unlike a grid search ,",
    "the mcmc search begins with an initial guess and a range for each parameter , and makes random steps in each parameter in order to explore the range .",
    "the amplitude of the random step size is initially large but decreases during the first stage of the computation as the space is explored . in the latter stage ,",
    "smaller steps are used to refine the best chi - squared potential . in order to establish the parameter space for each source and the initial guess , we ran initial executions with very broad ranges in order to encompass plausible values .",
    "based on these results , we narrowed the ranges somewhat .",
    "the typical search parameters were ranges of @xmath51  k for cool sources and @xmath52  k for warm sources in temperature , @xmath53 km  s@xmath9  in linewidth , @xmath54 km  s@xmath9  in velocity , and a factor of 10 - 50 in column density ( all centered on the initial guess ) , and a range of 0.1 - 0.5 for angular diameter . with these ranges",

    "in addition to a dust component , this source shows excess emission at 1.3  cm , the nature of which remains unclear .",

    "this slope is only marginally steeper than an optically - thick blackbody , and is similar to the values recently reported in the low - mass class 0 protostar l1527 @xcite and in source vla2 in the high mass star - forming core afgl2591 @xcite . if this emission arises from dust ,",
    "then , as summarized by @xcite , it could be explained by large dust grains ( compared to the wavelength ) , non - isothermal conditions , or optically - thick structure , in which case it must be very compact .",
    "a similar spectral index is seen in the source ngc  6334  i - sma4 @xcite , suggesting that it arises from a not uncommon phase of evolution of massive star formation .",

    "again , more sensitive and higher resolution observations are needed to explore these possibilities .",
    "the rest of the continuum sources that are detected at 1.3  mm and 0.87  mm but not at longer wavelengths almost certainly arise from dust emission . if they were free - free emission , the allowed range of spectral index ( -0.1 for optically - thin emission to @xmath87 for optically - thick emission )",
    "would make them easily detectable in the vla images . as described in ",
    "[ missingflux ] , our 0.87  mm measurements of sma  13 and sma  15 do not suffer from missing flux , and their steep spectral indices from 1.3  mm to 0.87  mm are consistent with thermal dust .",
    "however , we must consider the chances of these sources being extragalactic background objects dominated by dust emission . the south pole telescope ( spt - sz ) survey of 771 square degrees in three frequency bands provides a good reference point for comparison @xcite . from their cumulative distribution plot ,",
    "the number of spt detections with dust - like spectral energy distributions that are brighter than 25  mjy at 220  ghz is only 0.25 - 0.40 per square degree .",
    "the probability of encountering such a source in the field of view of figure  [ fig1 ] is only @xmath88 .",
    "thus , it is safe to conclude that these are not background objects , but are members of the protocluster . in the case of sma  2 and sma  5 , although the spectral indices are consistent with dust emission , we can only place lower limits on @xmath75 : 1.0 and 0.5 , respectively ( based on the upper limits at 1.3  cm and the lower limits at 0.87  mm ) .      regarding the two new 6  cm point sources ( vla  2 and h@xmath1o - c4 ) that are not detected in millimeter continuum , the fact that one of them ( h@xmath1o - c4 ) coincides with a h@xmath1o maser is compelling evidence that it is tracing a protostellar object , due to the strong association of molecular outflows with h@xmath1o masers @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is the fourth brightest of the 11 h@xmath1o masers in the region , with an isotropic luminosity of @xmath89 @xmath23 , which is characteristic of massive young stellar objects ( mysos ) ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and the high end of intermediate - mass ysos ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . in the @xcite red msx source ( rms )",

    "so we must assess the possibility that it is a background source .",
    "using the formula of @xcite for the expected number of background sources at 6  cm as a function of field size , we calculate a 4.4% chance of finding a background object of @xmath91  mjy in the field of view in figure  [ fig1 ] . alternatively , using the source counts from more recent evla 10  cm observations and extrapolating their flux densities to 6  cm with the typical spectral index of @xmath92 @xcite , we find an expected source density of @xmath93 sr@xmath9 .",
    "multiplying by the solid angle of figure  [ fig1 ] , we calculate a 6.3% chance of finding a source in the range of 0.05 - 0.15  mjy .",
    "thus , the most likely scenario is that vla2 resides in the protocluster and may trace some form of young stellar object .",
    "given the lack of millimeter continuum and maser emission , the centimeter emission could also arise from a low - mass , pre - main sequence ( pms ) star in which any associated circumstellar dust emission is too faint to be detected .",
    "such objects have been seen , for example in the cepheus a east star - forming region @xcite at a distance of 700  pc @xcite .",

    "the unprecedented multiplicity of sources in this field allows us to quantitatively analyze the structure of a young massive protocluster for the first time .",
    "first , we define the membership of the protocluster by requiring either the detection of compact millimeter continuum emission or the positional coincidence of at least two star formation indicators . starting with the source list of table  [ contsources ] , we exclude sma  7 as there is no compact component detected . of the two new 6  cm sources",
    ", we can include only the h@xmath1o maser source h@xmath1o - c4 .",

    "finally , although we have presented strong evidence that sma  1b and 1d are independent sources , they may form a binary system . our sensitivity to binaries",
    "is clearly limited by our angular resolution , so we choose to count these two objects as a single source in order to avoid biasing the following statistics by double counting some binaries but not others .",
    "the final tally of sources is then @xmath96 .",
    "the area of the protocluster on the sky is limited by the 1.3  mm primary beam .",
    "the largest angular radius from the phase center of a detected source at 1.3  mm is @xmath97 , where @xmath98  mjy  beam@xmath9 .",
    "this implies that our sample of the 1.3  mm compact sources in this region is complete down to 25  mjy across a physical radius of 0.21  pc corresponding to a projected area of 0.14  pc@xmath99 and a spherical volume of 0.038  pc@xmath100 .",
    "the presence of 25 sources within this volume yields an average number density of 660  pc@xmath3 .",
    "we note that only 20 of the sources are above the 25  mjy completeness threshold ; therefore , this computed density is strictly a lower limit even if the underlying population does not extend beyond the faintest detection .",
    "in other words , due to the radial decrease in sensitivity , the faintest sources detected in the central portion of the field would have been missed in the outer portions of the field .    following the techniques applied to infrared and optical observations of clusters of stars and hii regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "it is also limited in terms of sensitivity depth .",
    "future more sensitive observations with a wider field of view are needed to improve the robustness of this result . in any case , it is likely that this protocluster exists in a stage when its ultimate structure is still to be determined .      using the virial theorem ,",

    "the mass values are not as high as massive disk candidates ( e.g. the 0.8 - 8@xmath11 of iras  20126 + 4104 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but they are an order of magnitude higher than the typical masses of circumstellar disks around low - mass stars , for example 0.005 - 0.14  @xmath11 in the ophiuchus sample of @xcite . however , they are not too massive to be disks around intermediate mass stars .",
    "there are a number of examples of herbig a stars with disk masses of @xmath190.2@xmath11 , such as mac  ch12 @xcite .",
    "its 1.3  mm flux density of 44  mjy @xcite would be 19  mjy at the distance of ngc  6334  i(n ) .",
    "a more massive example is sma1 in g5.89 - 0.39 , which appears to be an intermediate mass protostar with @xmath191  @xmath11 of circumstellar material @xcite .",
    "thus , along with the lower mass population of disks around high - mass protostars ( such as the 0.8  @xmath11 of afgl2591  vla3 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we may also be detecting the most massive tip of the population of disks around intermediate - mass protostars in this protocluster .    finally , in principle one can use the h@xmath1 gas column density estimated from the dust column density to calculate the ch@xmath5cn abundance , subject to the assumption that both tracers arise from the same volume of gas . in the case of sma  1b ,",
    "the fitted size of the dust emission ( 0.87 at 1.3  mm and 0.47 at 0.87  mm ) is significantly larger than the modeled size of the ch@xmath5cn emission region ( 0.38 ) , so this assumption is not valid .",
    "nevertheless , proceeding with this uncertainty , the gas column density toward sma  1b inferred from the dust emission is @xmath131  cm@xmath115 , yielding an abundance estimate of @xmath133 .",
    "similarly , for the next two brightest line sources ( sma  2 and sma  4 ) , we obtain abundances of @xmath134 and @xmath135 . given all the uncertainties , these values are in reasonable agreement with the assumed value of @xmath136 ( see   [ hotcore ] ) .",
    "higher resolution observations are needed to obtain more accurate estimates of the molecular abundances via this method .",
    "the position angle of the velocity gradient in the molecular gas in sma  1b ( @xmath1375 ) is equal to the position angle of the two - dimensional gaussian model fit to the dust emission ( figure  [ sma1bd ] ) : @xmath1379at 1.3  mm ( table  [ contsources ] ) and @xmath1388at 0.87  mm ( table  [ contsourcesband7 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , this position angle is 91 different from the position angle of @xmath139 determined for the sio  5 - 4 outflow ( * ? ? ?",
    "* also see figure  [ methanolmasers ] ) .",
    "this perpendicularity is heavily suggestive of a disk - outflow system . in a few of the lower temperature transitions , including hc@xmath5n , ocs , and @xmath47cs",
    ", emission extends beyond sma  1b by up to an arcsecond along the outflow direction on one or both sides .",
    "this behavior is not expected from a compact disk . however , at these locations , the kinematic structure changes from a strong gradient to a narrower range of velocities , suggesting that these transitions are tracing an interaction of the outflow with ambient material near the disk .    to further explore the velocity gradient toward sma  1b ,",
    "we constructed position - velocity ( pv ) images ( figure  [ pv ] ) for the same 12 transitions whose moment maps were shown in figure  [ moments ] ( the position and orientation of the slice is shown on the ch@xmath5ocho panel of figure  [ moments ] ) . in the context of a disk",
    ", three main factors will govern the appearance of the pv image of a molecular line : ( 1 ) the overall physical structure of the circum - protostellar material , in particular the outer radius , inner radius ( if there is a central cavity ) , and the thickness ; ( 2 ) the radial gradient in the temperature , density , and molecular abundance ; and ( 3 ) the observer s viewing angle .",
    "evidence for chemical segregation in the context of a hot core was recently reported for the inner 3000  au of the afgl2591  vla3 , in which different species appear to trace different radii with respect to the continuum peak @xcite .",
    "one interpretation of this object is that it contains a massive disk @xcite . in the case of ngc  6334",
    "i(n )  sma  1b , we observe the overall shapes of the structures in the pv images to be generally consistent with one another , but the differences are worth noting . in general , the high temperature transitions are peaked toward the central source , including the two highest temperature ch@xmath5oh lines , ch@xmath5cn k=7 , and ch@xmath5ch@xmath1cn .",
    "in contrast , most of the lower temperature transitions show a double peak with a local minimum toward the central source , including @xmath47cs , ocs , ch@xmath5ocho and ch@xmath5cn k=3 .",
    "this pattern is consistent with the combination of a radial temperature gradient in which the hotter gas lies closer to the central heating source , and a viewing angle that is edge - on ( or at least moderately so ) .",
    "the two species that deviate from this picture are hnco , which shows a distinctive compact morphology , and hc@xmath5n , which extends to higher velocities .",
    "regarding hnco , @xcite recently modelled its abundance in hot cores versus time using a wide range of assumed chemical reactions ( both grain and gas - phase ) , along with different initial cloud collapse temperatures and post - collapse ( hot core ) temperatures .",
    "they find the best agreement with observed abundances from models that include both grain and gas - phase chemistry , cloud collapse temperatures of 10  k , and post - collapse temperatures @xmath140  k. furthermore , the late peak of hnco abundance with time ( @xmath141 yr ) suggests that hnco is not itself a `` first generation '' species liberated from dust grains . instead , it is the ejection of several larger hnco `` daughter '' molecules formed on the grains ( such as hncoho , hncocho , hnconh , and hncooh ) and their subsequent destruction that form hnco in the gas phase .",
    "the compact size of the observed hnco emission relative to other species suggests that this formation scenario is efficiently proceeding only in the inner disk , perhaps due to the higher temperatures there .",
    "regarding hc@xmath5n , not only does its emission extend to higher velocities , but these velocities arise exclusively from locations close to the center .",
    "this pattern suggests faster rotation toward the inner radii .",
    "however , it is somewhat surprising that hc@xmath5n is seen closer to the central source than other molecules given that it has a relatively high photodissociation rate @xcite and that ionizing radiation should be stronger at smaller radii . on the other hand , if there are locations with sufficient shielding , such as in the mid - plane of a high column density disk , the formation of hc@xmath5n can proceed quickly as a product of c@xmath1h@xmath1 and cn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and cn has a low photodissociation rate @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the hc@xmath5n abundance observed toward the continuum peak of afgl2591  vla3 by @xcite exceeds their gas - grain chemical evolution model predictions by more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "indeed , these authors emphasize that molecular abundances are very sensitive to extinction , and hence the detailed geometry of the system .",
    "as seen in figure  [ pv ] , the maximum extent of the emission toward sma  1b is @xmath142 ( @xmath10800  au ) and the observed range of gas velocities at that radius is approximately @xmath143  km  s@xmath9 with respect to the lsr . if this emission is interpreted as arising from a circular rotating disk , then these two quantities alone can be used to make a simple dynamical estimate of the central enclosed mass using kepler s law for circular rotation : @xmath144 @xmath11 , where @xmath145 is the angle of inclination of the rotation axis to the line of sight . however , rotation is not the only possible motion , as evidence for infall in this source has already been demonstrated by the trend of the increasingly redshifted absorption features with increasing line excitation seen in three transitions of cn and h@xmath1co @xcite .",
    "therefore , to build a more illustrative physical model , we follow the approach of equation  1 of @xcite , where we interpret the pv images as arising from a rotating keplerian disk undergoing free - fall and having a specific inner and outer radius .",
    "using this model , the white contour in figure  [ pv ] encompasses the entire region where emission can arise ( ignoring any effects of line opacity and dust opacity ) from a disk with an enclosed mass of @xmath146  @xmath11 , and the specified inner and outer radii for each transition .",
    "( for comparison , the model without free - fall is included as the black contour in the first panel of figure  [ pv ] . )",
    "the inner radius sets the total extent of the white contour along the velocity axis , while the outer radius sets its total extent along the position axis .",
    "most of the molecular transitions are consistent with a model having an inner radius of 500  au , and outer radius of 800  au .",
    "the hc@xmath5n line is more consistent with a smaller inner radius of @xmath19200  au , while the hnco line is more consistent with originating from a narrow range of inner radii ( 400 - 500 au ) .",
    "the outer radius of 800  au seen in most species is comparable to the semi - major axis of the deconvolved gaussian model of the continuum from sma  1b , which is 660@xmath1033  au at 1.3  mm ( table  [ contsources ] ) and 403@xmath1020  au at 0.87  mm ( table  [ contsourcesband7 ] ) .",
    "for example , an outer radius of 800  au for the molecular gas would correspond to the 7@xmath102 percent point of the 0.87  mm model dust source .",
    "thus , the extent of the dust and gas emission yield similar values for the size of the structure . assuming circular symmetry , the observed ellipticity of the 0.87  mm deconvolved model can then be used to set a lower limit for @xmath145 of 55 , i.e. nearly edge - on .",
    "the corresponding upper limit for the enclosed mass is then 30  @xmath11 .",
    "we note that for a disk viewed edge - on , the line emission from the innermost radii will be obscured by the high optical depth of the foreground material in the disk , both from the gas and ( at some point ) the dust grains . to demonstrate , the ch@xmath5cn optical depths at line center for the @xmath41=7 and 8 components , derived from their peak brightness temperatures in the single - temperature cassis model , are 0.7 and 0.4 , respectively .",
    "although the presence of a keplerian disk is tantalizing , future higher resolution observations are necessary to properly model the geometry and inclination angle and to confirm the expected kinematic structure in more detail .",
    "radiative transfer modelling will no doubt be profitable in delineating and interpreting the chemical structure as it has been for low - mass protostellar disks @xcite .",
    "using new high - resolution sma and vla images from 6  cm to 0.87  mm , we have found further multiplicity in ngc  6334  i(n ) , allowing us to perform the first structural analysis of a massive protocluster using techniques developed for optical / infrared studies of star clusters .",
    "we also demonstrate the first use of the thermal gas velocities from an ensemble of hot cores to probe the dynamical properties of a protocluster .",
    "our results are summarized as follows :    * we have identified 16 new compact 1.3  mm continuum sources and two new 6  cm sources .",
    "three of the newly discovered sources are associated with h@xmath1o masers .",
    "combined with the previously - known 1.3  mm sources from @xcite , the total number of compact centimeter or millimeter sources is 28 . limiting our analysis to likely protostars , i.e. 25 sources ( see   [ clusterstructure ] ) , we measure a protostellar density of @xmath2 pc@xmath3 and a minimum spanning tree @xmath4-parameter of 0.82 .",
    "although our measurement of the @xmath4-parameter is likely limited in terms of sensitivity and extent , the value is close to the expected value for a uniform volume density of sources .",
    "* all nine sources detected at more than one continuum wavelength have seds indicative of dust emission . the long wavelength emission toward sma  1b and sma  4",
    "is well modeled by the additional presence of a hchii region .",
    "thermal molecular line emission is detected towards six of the 1.3 mm continuum sources ( sma1b , sma2 , sma4 , sma6 , sma15 , and sma18 ) . from lte modeling of ch@xmath5cn ( @xmath6=12 - 11 ) using cassis we find gas temperatures ranging from 95 - 373  k , ch@xmath5cn column densities from ( 4 - 40)@xmath147 cm@xmath115 , and h@xmath1 gas densities of ( 0.8 - 9)@xmath148 cm@xmath3 ( assuming a ch@xmath5cn : h@xmath149 abundance of @xmath57 ) .",
    "the radial velocities of the hot cores , measured from ch@xmath5cn , range from @xmath7 to @xmath8 km  s@xmath9 , and the corresponding 1d velocity dispersion of 1.43 km  s@xmath9 implies a dynamical mass of @xmath150 @xmath11 .",
    "this mass is compatible with the gas mass of @xmath151  @xmath11 based on single dish imaging , and demonstrates that hot core line emission can be an important probe of protocluster dynamics .",
