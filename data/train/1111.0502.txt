    "the neutrinos from sn 1987a have been the subject of hundreds of papers , both theoretical and phenomenological.@xcite some of these papers analyze the data to infer an upper limit on the neutrino mass , which ranges typically from 12 to 16 @xmath2.@xcite .",
    "it is expected however that neutrinos from a supernova should include all three active neutrino mass eigenstates , therefore such a limit must represent some sort of average over whichever eigenstates are represented in the neutrino events recorded",
    ". there have in fact been at least three analyses of the sn 1987a neutrino data that have given evidence for a bifurcation into two groupings.@xcite .",
    "the analysis by loredo was based on baysian statistics,@xcite and it gave no physical interpretation to the two classes of events .",
    "the roos paper based the bifurcation on neutrino mass , but he attributed the different mass values to the events recorded in the two detectors , rather than to two mass eigenstates .",
    "finally , the cowsik paper did suggest a bifurcation associated with two mass eigenstates whose masses he found based on the relation between neutrino arrival times and their measured energies .",
    "cowsik reported these eigenstates as @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we here extend his analysis to include the possibility of observed regularity arising in part from chance , or variations in their emission times at the source , since his conclusion was conditional on there being near instantaneous emissions .",
    "additionally , we show how the result can be made consistent with existing electron neutrino mass limits , and other experiments . as with most sn 1987a analyses ,",
    "we include neutrino events recorded in the kamioka , and imb detectors , but exclude the 5 events seen in the mont blanc detector since they occured 5 hours before those detected by the other three detectors . additionally , given its size and sensitivity that detector should have only seen 1 neutrino from the supernova not 5 .",
    "we also exclude 5 events seen in the baksan detector because there are substantial reasons to believe that perhaps 2 or 3 of them may have been due to background .    as noted in the paper on the baksan neutrinos from sn 1987a.@xcite",
    "* the 5 event burst they saw over a 10 s period was only slightly above their background , since there have been past instances when the baksan detector recorded 3 `` random '' events in 10 seconds * the timing of the baksan burst occurred 30 s after those seen in the imb and kamioka detectors * the 5 baksan events were spread evenly over the entire 10 s period , not bunched strongly near the start of the 1987a burst as with the other detectors .",
    "thus , there is considerable uncertainty over the true @xmath5 time for these events relative to the other two detectors .",
    "the basic idea of the analysis is straightforward .",
    "a neutrino of mass m and energy e that is emitted at a time @xmath6 and observed in a detector at time t will take a time to reach earth given by    @xmath7    where the approximation requires that @xmath8 be small compared to @xmath9 and where @xmath10 is the light travel time from sn 1987a or 168,000 years .",
    "eq . 1 allows us to calculate a mass @xmath11 for the kth neutrino event observed at a time @xmath12 whose energy is @xmath13 , assuming the neutrino was emitted at time @xmath14 , and travelled a distance @xmath15 to reach earth .",
    "note that @xmath16 can vary from one event to another depending on the collapsing core radius at the time that neutrino was emitted .",
    "on solving for the mass attributed to a given event , we have :    @xmath17    but clearly eq .",
    "2 can only be used to find @xmath11 when @xmath14 and @xmath16 are both nearly event - independent , which requires near - simultaneous emissions .",
    "the evidence for near simultaneous emissions comes from supernova core collapse models and their calculated neutrino fluxes as a function of time , specifically :    1 .",
    "_ brief `` burst '' of @xmath18 _ the literature on electron neutrinos and antineutrinos emitted during a core collapse consistently shows that both fluxes rise and fall over a very short time interval .",
    "typically , this initial burst is found to rise and fall by almost an order of magnitude over a time interval of 0.3 seconds,@xcite while some models show this `` burst '' of electron neutrinos and antineutrinos being as short as about 0.02 seconds.@xcite 2 .   _",
    "greater @xmath18 than @xmath19 flux during burst _",
    "these core collapse simulations find that the drop in emitted muon and tau neutrinos following its peak is much more gradual and extends over @xmath20 , but the initial @xmath18 flux during its short `` burst '' is found to be about an order of magnitude greater than the @xmath19 flux for @xmath21,@xcite and in any case , the sn 1987a neutrinos observed are unlikely to be these flavors  certainly not for the imb detector whose threshold was below muon neutrino detection .",
    "possibility of brief burst for @xmath19 _ although some core collapse simulations find that the drop in emitted muon and tau neutrino fluxes following its peak is much more gradual than @xmath18 , other authors suggest that a similar rapid rise and fall applies to these two flavors as well.@xcite  see keil , et.al for a summary of predictions from various models.@xcite 4 .",
    "_ correlation between neutrino energy and emission time _",
    "if the later arriving neutrinos are simply late because they were emitted at later times , one would expect them to have higher energies than the earlier emitted neutrinos according to the models , but this is not what the data show .",
    "given the above , it is not unreasonable to assume that most ( or all ) of the sn1987a neutrinos detected were emitted within a @xmath22 time interval .",
    "moreover , given the rapidity of the core collapse ( whose radius drops by an order of magnitude or more depending on mass ) within a time of 0.2 sec,@xcite we may assume that the neutrino travel distance changes very little for those emitted at the start and end of the @xmath23 burst .",
    "hence , taking @xmath24 , we may plausibly assume that within roughly a @xmath25 sec uncertainty @xmath26    thus , within this time uncertainty which we assign to the observed @xmath27 , eq .",
    "2 becomes :    @xmath28     +    we note that according to eq .",
    "3 @xmath5 for any @xmath29 requires @xmath30 .",
    "however , for a pair of unsynchronized detectors , for which @xmath5 was arbitrarily chosen to mark the arrival of their first event , it is unlikely that this time corresponds to the instant a photon emitted with the neutrino burst would have reached the detector  especially when the number of recorded events in each detector is small .",
    "however , straight line fits of @xmath31 versus @xmath12 show that the data is consistent with one of two lines both cosnsistent with passing through the origin .",
    "therefore , apart from a small time offset for each detector @xmath5 is consistent with @xmath24 . for our estimate of the size of this offset in each detector",
    "we have chosen 1/4 the time difference between each detector s first and second events : 0.107 s in kamioka , and 0.42 s in imb in using eq . 3 to find the mass for each event .",
    "however , since these estimated detector offsets are rather uncertain , the @xmath32 uncertainty due to a spread in emission times at the source has been increased to a net uncertainty for all the @xmath12 of @xmath33 when computing the uncertainty in the mass associated with each event using :    @xmath34    and @xmath35    .masses in @xmath2 for 6 kamioka events and 7 imb events that are clearly clustered about a weighted average of 21.4 @xmath2 .",
    "each event s mass is calculated from eq .",
    "3 using their observed time and energy with their associated propagated errors . [ cols=\"<,^,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in terms of the robustness of these results , it should be noted that :    1 .   _",
    "every _ kamioka or imb event in the data is included in this analysis , using the published values for t , e and @xmath36,@xcite .",
    "thus , baksan aside , it would appear there is no noise or background events in the sn 1987a data .",
    "moreover unlike earlier interpretations of the data where only events with @xmath37 seconds are assumed to be part of the main supernova burst here it is assumed that they all are .",
    "every _ event is cleanly associated with _ only _ one of the two mass eigenstates given its error bars , and as noted previously the chi squares for the two fits are quite acceptable . in contrast",
    "fitting all 20 events using a single gaussian distribution gives an infinitessimally small probability .",
    "every event is consistent with @xmath38 values that are positive . in any case , no assumption was made at the outset in this analysis about whether there were or were not events having `` tachyonic '' or superluminal masses , which would have to lie on negatively sloped lines in fig.1 .",
    "4 .   as a general rule",
    "it is not very unlikely to find some kind of interesting pattern with only 20 events just based on chance .",
    "however , finding a highly specific pattern ( every single event strongly clustering about one of two mass values is quite another matter , especially given the support from supernova models showing that the detection times are very likely indicators of the neutrino travel times within a @xmath39 uncertainty in @xmath12 .",
    "one could choose to disregard the present models of supernova core collapse , and insist on a significant spread in neutrino emission times .",
    "but in that case , one would need to assume the existence of some kind of weird correlation between the varying emission times and the emitted neutrino energies that perfectly mimics the presence of two discrete mass eigenstates at earth s particular distance from sn 1987a .",
    "moreover , this correlation would fail to produce that result if the distance , @xmath40 to sn 1987a happened to be significantly different , because the neutrino travel times for a given energy are proportional to @xmath40 , making this alternative explanation extremely improbable .",
    "the values reported here for the two observed mass eigenstate might seem implausibly high . given that the electron neutrino presumably consists of a mixture of the light mass eigenstate plus one or both of the other two , the @xmath18 mass seemingly would need to exceed that of @xmath41 which is inconsistent with the upper limit on the mass of the electron neutrino from tritium decay : @xmath42@xcite .",
    "however , there is an interesting possible explanation of this anomaly that depends on the opera experiment on superluminal @xmath43 neutrinos being correct.@xcite given the reported opera excess over light speed , one can calculate the muon neutrino mass that would give that result . using the average neutrino energy in the experiment",
    "@xmath44 one find a superluminal neutrino masss :    @xmath45    since opera only measures a single average mass even if several mass eigenstates are present , this need not equal the mass of one single eigenstate .",
    "however if this mass did represent that of a single superluminal very heavy eigenstate , a sn 1987a neutrino having this mass and an energy @xmath46 it would have reached earth in the past by :    @xmath47    which could explain the absence of this eigenstate in the sn 1987 data , i.e. , why the opera result need not be in conflict with the more stringent upper limit from sn 1987a on the value of @xmath48 .",
    "furthermore , the opera result , if correct , offers a way to understand why the upper limit on the mass of the electron neutrino from tritium decay : @xmath42 need not be in conflict with the `` implausibly high '' values of @xmath49 and @xmath50 reported here .",
    "for example , suppose that the electron neutrino consisted of a superposition of a tachyonic and tardyonic mass states : @xmath51 where the superscripts refer to the signs of the respective @xmath38 values for the two states whose masses are @xmath52 and @xmath53 to find the mass of the mixed state @xmath54 we need the expectation value of @xmath55 , i.e. ,    @xmath56    if we assume that the mass states have a common momentum @xmath57 their respective energies are @xmath58 and @xmath59 where we obviously have @xmath60 .",
    "thus , eq .",
    "7 gives a mass for the mixed state :    @xmath61    it is clear that @xmath38 could be anything between the superluminal ( tachyonic ) @xmath62 and the tardyonic @xmath63 depending on the values of the mixing angle @xmath64 in particular , under this scenario , the large superluminal mass eigenstate implied by opera could be consistent with a value for the electron neutrino mass very close to zero and superluminal depending on the mixing angle .",
    "in fact , there is previous work that supports the idea that @xmath65.@xcite    in the same manner , the possibility of a very heavy superluminal mass eigenstate need not conflict with the tight limits from cosmology and astrophysics on the sum of the three neutrino masses assuming they have @xmath66 , @xcite , nor would it necessarily conflict with a suggested tachyonic mass limit of @xmath67 that applies to the flavor eigenstates.@xcite given the much greater sensitivity of today s neutrino detectors compared to those of 1987 , were there to be a once - in - a - century occurrence of a supernova in our galaxy , it could offer either a clear confirmation or refutation of the existence of the two mass eigenstates claimed here .",
    "furthermore , in the event of a confirmation , it would be exceedingly difficult to see how the mass limits from tritium beta decay and cosmology could be satisfied without the existence of a superluminal mass eigenstate .",
