    "it is wellknown that for relatively short polymer chains the standard rouse model can describe the dynamics of a melt reasonably well @xcite . on the contrary , for chain length",
    "@xmath3 exceeding a critical length , the entanglement length @xmath4 , the behavior is usually described by the reptation model @xcite . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to chain lengths @xmath5 , i.e. the entangled polymer dynamics will be beyond of our consideration .",
    "the reason why in a dense melt the rouse model provides so well dynamical description for short chains is connected with a screening of the long - range hydrodynamic as well as the excluded volume interactions . as a result the fluctuations of the chain variables are gaussian .",
    "but there are further essential questions : how does the bare monomeric friction coefficient @xmath6 and the entropic elastic modulus @xmath7 ( which are simple input parameters of the standard rouse model ) change due to the interactions of the test chain and the surrounding matix ?",
    "why does such a simple model work so well for describing short chain melts ?",
    "obviously , the corresponding answers can not be given by the rouse model , which describes only the dynamics of connected gaussian springs without further interactions .",
    "on the other hand , at relatively low temperatures close to the glass transition of the surrounding matrix the deviations from the standard rouse behavior will be definitely more pronounced .",
    "for example , monte carlo ( mc ) studies of the bond fluctuation model at low temperatures ( but still above the temperature region where possibly the glass transition mode coupling theory @xcite applies ) show that the rouse modes remain well - defined eigenmodes of the polymer chains and the chains retain their gaussian properties @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the relaxation of the rouse modes displays a stretched exponential behavior rather than a pure exponential .",
    "it could even be expected that at temperatures below the glass transition temperature of the matrix @xmath0 the rouse modes are frozen out . in these temperature regimes",
    "the interactions between monomers take a significant role and determine the physical picture of the dynamics as will be shown below .",
    "the generalized rouse equation ( gre ) , which can be used for the investigation of the problems mentioned above , has been derived by using projection formalism methods and mode coupling approximations ( mca ) @xcite . as a result of projection operator formalism the time evolution of the test chain",
    "is expressed in terms of a frequency matrix , which is local in time , and a memory function contribution due to the inter - chain forces exerted on the test chain segments . with the assumption that the frequency matrix term has the same form as in the standard rouse model ( linear elasticity with the entropic modulus @xmath8 ) all influence of the matrix chains reduce to the memory function contribution @xcite .",
    "the projection operator methods appears to be exact but rather formal , and to derive explicit results further approximations have to be made , which can be hardly controlled often .",
    "therefore it is instructive to use another alternative theoretical method to derive the gre .",
    "recently , a non - pertubative variational method which is equivalent to a selfconsistent hartree approximation was used for the investigation of the dynamics of manifolds @xcite and sine - gordon model @xcite in a random media . as a starting point",
    "the authors employed the standard martin - siggia - rose ( msr ) functional integral technique @xcite . here",

    ", we give a general msr - functional integral formulation for a test chain in a polymer ( or non - polymer ) matrix . under the assumption that the fluctuations of the test chain are gaussian",
    "the hartree - type approximation is applied and a gre is finally derived .",
    "the case when the fluctuation dissipation theorem ( fdt ) and the time homogenity are violated is also shortly considered . in section 3 on the basis of the gre some static and dynamical properties of the test chain are discussed .",
    "in particular the theory of the test chain ergodicity breaking ( freezing ) in a glassy matrix is formulated .",

    "one can see that in the reasonable range of parameters @xmath158 . as a result",

    "this model was used for the investigation of the @xmath161-peak in the spectrum of glass forming systems @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have derived a gre for a test polymer chain in a polymer ( or non - polymer ) matrix which has its own intrinsic dynamics , e.g. the glassy dynamics @xcite .",
    "we have used here the msr - functional integral technique which could be considered as an alternative to the projection operator formalism @xcite .",
    "one of the difficulties in this formalism is the necessity of dealing with the projected dynamic , which is difficult to handle with explicitly . on the contrary in msr",
    "- technique the dynamic of slow variables is well defined and several approximations which one have to employ could be justified .    in the interaction of the test chain with the surrounding matrix only two - point correlation and response",
    "functions are involved . in terms of mca",
    "@xcite this obviously corresponds to the projection of the generalized forces only onto the bilinear variables : product of test chain density and matrix density .    to handle with the action in the gf of the test chain we used the hartree - type approximation ( i.e. , equivalent to the feynman variational principle ) @xcite , which is reasonable when the fluctuations of the test chain are gaussian . in the case of a polymer melt ( high densitiy )",
    "this is indeed the case due to the screening effects for the excluded volume @xcite .",
    "the use of the hartree - type makes the problem that we deal with analytically amenable and results in the gre s for the case when the fdt holds as well as for the case when fdt does not hold . in this paper",
    "we have restricted ourselves to the first case and have shown that the interaction with the matrix renormalizes not only the friction coefficient ( which makes the chain non - markovian ) but also the elastic modulus ( which changes the static correlator ) .",
    "the form of the static correlator for the rouse mode variables is qualitatively supported by md - simulations @xcite .",
    "as regards the dynamical behaviour , we have shown that the test chain in a glassy matrix ( with the matrix glass transition temperature @xmath0 ) undergoes the ergodicity breaking transition at a temperature @xmath162 .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath1 could be parametrized with the rouse mode index @xmath2 and is a decreasing function of @xmath2 .",
    "we have considered only the a - type transition which is assured by the bilinear term in the expansion of eq .",
    "( [ gammap ] ) .",
    "it seems reasonable that keeping the whole exponential function in eq .",
    "( [ gammap ] ) might lead to a b - type transition also .",
    "the results also essentially would change if the off - diagonal elements in the matrix ( [ 2rt ] ) can not be neglected ( see eq .",
    "( [ grerq ] ) ) . in this case",
    "only one ideal transition temperature @xmath163 would be possible .",
    "the general theory of a a - type transition was discussed in @xcite .",
    "this picture of freezing here should not be mixed with a different one , the underlying glass transition by itself ( e.g. the glass transition of the matrix at @xmath164 ) . according to the present view of this phenomenon @xcite , the spontaneous arrest of the density fluctuations",
    "is driven by those of the microscopic lengthscale @xmath165 , where @xmath165 is the wave vector which corresponds to the structure factor s main maximum .",
    "the freezing of these fluctuations then arrests the others through the mode coupling .",
