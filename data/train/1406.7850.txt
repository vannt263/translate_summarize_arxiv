    "this paper grew out of the following question : given a metrisable topological space @xmath0 , and a homeomorphism @xmath4 of @xmath0 , how can one determine whether there exists a distance inducing the topology of @xmath0 and for which @xmath4 is an isometry ?",
    "more generally , it is interesting to determine when there exists a compatible invariant distance for an action by homeomorphisms of some group @xmath1 on @xmath0 .",
    "when this happens we say that the action @xmath2 is _",
    "isometrisable_.    when @xmath0 is compact , this problem is well understood , and various characterisations are available  for instance , in that case an action @xmath2 is isometrisable if and only if it is equicontinuous , in the sense that for any open @xmath5 containing the diagonal @xmath6 , there exists an open @xmath7 containing @xmath6 and such that for all @xmath8 one has @xmath9 .",
    "one way to prove this is to note that , if the latter property holds , then the sets @xmath10 form a countably generated uniformity which is compatible with the topology and admits a basis of invariant entourages , and such a uniformity comes from a @xmath1-invariant metric ( as a general reference about uniformities and the basic facts about them used in this paper , the reader may consult chapter 8 in @xcite ) . one could equivalently formalise the previous condition by saying that @xmath1 generates a relatively compact subgroup of the group of homeomorphisms of @xmath0 , endowed with the topology of uniform convergence for some compatible distance on @xmath0 ( here the nontrivial direction follows from the arzel - ascoli theorem , or by considering averages of any compatible metric against the haar measure of @xmath1 ) .    beyond that , only the locally compact case seems to be addressed in the literature .",
    "marjanovi @xcite appears to be the first with a significant result in this direction . in order to formulate it",
    ", we recall that , if @xmath11 is a family of continuous maps from a topological space @xmath0 to a topological space @xmath12 , @xmath11 is said to be _ evenly continuous _",
    "if for all @xmath13 , all @xmath14 and all open @xmath15 , there exists an open @xmath16 and an open @xmath17 with @xmath18 and such that @xmath19    let @xmath0 be a locally compact separable metrisable space , and @xmath20 be homeomorphism of @xmath0 .",
    "then there is a compatible distance for which @xmath20 is an isometry if , and only if , the family @xmath21 is evenly continuous from @xmath0 to its alexandrov compactification .",
    "this result was slightly extended by borges @xcite and kiang @xcite ; it follows from kiang s work that marjanovi s result extends to arbitrary groups acting on locally compact separable metrisable spaces ( though that fact is not explicitly formulated in @xcite and could also be deduced from marjanovi s argument , it is a direct consequence of the main theorem of @xcite ) .",
    "one obstacle to extend these results beyond the locally compact case is the presence of the alexandrov compactification in the statement ; another is that marjanovi s and kiang s arguments rely heavily on compactness . to address the first issue",
    ", one might try considering a stronger property than even continuity .",
    "the action @xmath2 is _ topologically equicontinuous _ if , for any @xmath22 and any open subset @xmath15 , there exists open subsets @xmath23 and @xmath24 such that @xmath25    it is obvious that , if @xmath2 is isometrisable , then it is topologically equicontinuous .",
    "it is also not hard to check that , when @xmath0 is locally compact , even continuity of @xmath1 as a family of maps from @xmath0 to its alexandrov compactification is equivalent to topological equicontinuity of @xmath1 as a family of maps from @xmath0 to itself .",
    "topological equicontinuity is a strong assumption , and we discuss some consequences in the second section .",
    "it appears not to be sufficient for isometrisability of the action @xmath2 , leading us to consider an even stronger property .",
    "we say that @xmath2 is _ uniformly topologically equicontinuous _ if , for any @xmath26 and any open @xmath15 , there exists an open @xmath27 with @xmath24 and such that for all @xmath13 there exists an open neighborhood @xmath17 of @xmath28 satisfying @xmath29    our main result is the following .",

    "then the action @xmath2 is isometrisable if , and only if , it is uniformly topologically equicontinuous .",
    "rahter than directly defining a @xmath1-invariant compatible metric under the assumption of uniform topological equicontinuity , our argument proceeds by building a countably generated uniformity with a basis of @xmath1-invariant entourages , then using the fact that such an uniformity is generated by @xmath1-invariant pseudometrics , and finally using second countability to subsume this family into one @xmath1-invariant metric .",

    "thus both @xmath63 and @xmath64 belong to @xmath27 , and @xmath65 .",
    "thus the sets @xmath54 form a basis of entourages for a uniformity , which is metrisable by a @xmath1-invariant distance @xmath66 since it is countably generated by @xmath1-invariant entourages , and we claim that it is compatible with the topology on @xmath0 .",
