    "an ensemble of globally coupled limit - cycle oscillators is a widely used model for many natural systems @xcite .",
    "the main , well - understood , effect in this setup is emergence of a collective mode ( mean field ) via synchronization of ensemble elements @xcite .",
    "typical synchronization scenario is as follows .",
    "if a homogeneous coupling between generally non - identical ensemble units is attractive and quantified by parameter @xmath0 , then , typically , with the increase of @xmath1 beyond some critical value , a number of oscillators adjust their ( initially different ) frequencies and form a synchronous group .",
    "the units in this group have coherent , though slightly different , phases and , as a result , produce a non - zero mean field . with the further increase of @xmath1 , more and more oscillators",
    "join the synchronous group and the mean field amplitude grows .",
    "the situation becomes almost trivial if the oscillators in the ensemble are _ identical _ : then full synchrony appears already for an arbitrarily small attractive coupling .",
    "the described synchronization scenario assumes that the interaction remains attractive for all values of @xmath1 and for all amplitudes of the collective mode .",
    "this is , however , not a general case : one can expect that weak and strong forcing on an oscillator may have different properties . in this paper",
    "we are interested exactly in the situations when the increase of the bifurcation parameter @xmath1 results in a change of the interaction type from an attractive to a repulsive one , yielding complex regimes already for the simplest setups with identical units .",
    "in particular , our goal is to analyze the _ quasiperiodic partially synchronous ( qps ) regimes _ that appear via a synchrony - breaking transition and are characterized by scattered or clustered oscillator states and yet non - vanishing collective mode ; the most important feature is the quasiperiodic dynamics of oscillators .",
    "we describe two types of such solutions . in one case , which we denote as qps - i , the time averaged frequencies of individual oscillators and of the mean field are different . in the second case , labeled as qps - ii ,",
    "the averaged frequencies coincide , but the motion of oscillators is additionally modulated .",
    "we demonstrate that these regimes between full synchrony and complete asynchrony appear in an ensemble of stuart - landau ( sl ) oscillators with global nonlinear coupling . for this model",
    ", we analytically find the conditions for two bifurcations resulting in emergence of two types of qps dynamics .",
    "furthermore , we reveal transitions between the qps - i and the qps - ii dynamics , as well as parameter domains where full synchrony coexists with the qps states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we introduce our basic model in section [ nlsl ] .",
    "then , in section [ weak_lim ] we discuss the weak - coupling limit and properties of partial synchrony in the phase approximation .",
    "next , in section [ sec : bpa ] we analyze stability of the synchronous and of the asynchronous state for arbitrary coupling , and present the diagram of different states . section [ sec : num ] presents the results of numerical analysis .",
    "we discuss and summarize our results in section [ sumdis ] .",
    "our basic model is a system of @xmath2 identical stuart - landau oscillators with global nonlinear coupling ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the complex mean field . here",
    "@xmath5 is the frequency of small oscillations ( it does not play any role since it can be eliminated by a transformation to a rotating reference frame ) and @xmath6 describes non - isochronicity of uncoupled oscillators .",
    "the coupling is quantified by four parameters : parameters @xmath7 describe linear coupling term @xmath8 , while parameters @xmath9 describe nonlinear coupling @xmath10 .",
    "notice that the case of purely linear coupling was extensively studied by hakim and rappel @xcite and by nakagawa and kuramoto @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "we come back to this case in the discussion section below .    in the synchronous regime @xmath11 and the stationary ( uniformly rotating with frequency @xmath12 ) solution of eqs .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) can be easily found : @xmath13 in the fully asynchronous regime the mean field @xmath14 vanishes .",
    "this state is microscopically degenerate , as there is just one condition on the distribution of @xmath2 phases .",
    "stability of the asynchronous and synchronous states is studied in the next sections .    before proceeding to a more general analysis ,",
    "we mention one intermediate dynamical state which appears for a special set of parameters .",
    "indeed , if the ratio @xmath15 is real , then for @xmath16 the coupling vanishes . in this regime , called `` bunch state '' in  @xcite , the oscillators are partially synchronized , but the dynamics is purely periodic as all units have the same frequency @xmath17 .",
    "close to the asynchronous regime , where the amplitude @xmath14 is small , the coupling between the oscillators is weak .",
    "this also holds for a non - small amplitude @xmath14 , if coupling parameters are small @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "for such a weak coupling , the amplitudes @xmath20 are only slightly perturbed : @xmath21 .",
    "then @xmath22 and the mean field @xmath14 is simply the kuramoto order parameter @xmath23=n^{-1}\\sum_j\\exp[{\\mathrm{i}}\\vp_j]$ ] , @xmath24 . using the standard approach @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) can be reduced to the phase dynamics : @xmath25\\ ; , \\label{e1_2}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 , while the amplitude @xmath27 and the phase shift @xmath28 in the coupling are determined from @xmath29    equation  ( [ e1_2 ] ) can be considered as a nonlinear generalization of the popular kuramoto - sakaguchi model @xcite .",
    "indeed , for the linear coupling @xmath30 we obtain exactly the kuramoto - sakaguchi model @xmath31 where @xmath32 generally , if both linear and nonlinear couplings are present , instead of two constants @xmath1 and @xmath28 we have two functions @xmath33 ; this model has been suggested and studied in @xcite .",
    "notice that this phase model also appears as an approximation of the system of sl oscillators , coupled through a common nonlinear load  @xcite .",
    "a very important property of the model ( [ e1_2 ] ) is its partial integrability : according to the watanabe - strogatz theory  @xcite , dynamics of ( [ e1_2 ] ) is described by three global variables and @xmath34 constants of motion ; this description is valid for any @xmath35 , including the thermodynamic limit @xmath36 ,    it is easy to see that synchronous solution of the model ( [ e1_2 ] ) is stable if + @xmath37<0 $ ] . to determine stability of the asynchronous state",
    ", we have to consider effect of a small perturbation , i.e. effect of the mean field with @xmath38 .",
    "this means that we can neglect the terms @xmath39 in   and the model reduces to the kuramoto - sakaguchi system ( [ eq : ks ] ) .",
    "so , only the linear part of the coupling contributes to the instability of the asynchronous state",
    ". the asynchronous state will be unstable if the coupling is attractive , i.e. if @xmath40",
    ". this condition yields instability provided @xmath41 , and stability otherwise .",
    "here we discuss partial synchrony in the framework of the phase approximation  .",
    "a detailed analysis of this model has been presented in  @xcite , so we just reproduce the basic ideas for consistency .",
    "consider first the pure kuramoto - sakaguchi case  . as is well - known , the synchronous state , @xmath42 , is stable , if @xmath43 , and unstable , if @xmath44 ( we remind that @xmath0 ) . for the asynchronous ( splay )",
    "state , @xmath45 , the stability conditions are reversed .",
    "hence , there occurs either full synchrony or full asynchrony .",
    "notice that existence of other attractive states with @xmath46 or of many - cluster solutions with @xmath45 is excluded by the watanabe - strogatz theory @xcite .",
    "complementarity of stability domains for synchronous and asynchronous solutions is a specific property of the kuramoto - sakaguchi model . for general",
    "globally coupled systems the situation can be different .",
    "so , we can expect overlap of stability domains for some parameter region ; then , in this region , the system is at least bi - stable .",
    "another possible case , of our interest here , is when _ both fully synchronous and fully asynchronous solutions are unstable_. then , for the corresponding parameters the system is enforced to settle at some non - trivial state between synchrony and asynchrony .",
    "an example is given by eq .",
    "( [ e1_2 ] ) , where @xmath47 depends on the order parameter @xmath48 .",
    "stability of the asynchronous state is determined solely by @xmath49 , while for the state of full synchrony , @xmath42 , the value @xmath50 is relevant . if @xmath51 and @xmath52 , both fully synchronous and asynchronous states are unstable ( the border between stability and instability domains for the synchronous state is determined from the condition @xmath53 ) .",
    "it means , that an intermediate , _ partially synchronous _ state with @xmath54 is established .",
    "the order parameter in this state is given by the condition @xmath55 .",
    "next , we stress that system ( [ e1_2 ] ) , like the kuramoto - sakaguchi model , is fully described by the watanabe - strogatz theory  @xcite which excludes the states with more than one synchronous cluster for general non - identical initial conditions .",
    "hence , at partial synchrony , all phases shall be scattered and non - uniformly distributed on the unit circle . as it follows from eq .",
    "( [ e1_2 ] ) , this scattering results in different instantaneous frequencies of all units .",
    "furthermore , it results in the most peculiar feature of this state , namely in a difference of the time - average frequencies of the units and of the frequency of the mean field .",
    "let us denote these frequencies as @xmath12 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "( notice that since oscillators are identical , all @xmath57 ) . in our previous publications @xcite we called such states with @xmath46 and @xmath58 self - organized quasiperiodic ( soq ) solutions .",
    "qualitatively the property @xmath59 can be shown by contradiction .",
    "suppose first the contrary , @xmath60 , and consider the motion in the frame , rotating with the mean field frequency @xmath56 .",
    "then , according to eq .",
    "( [ e1_2 ] ) , the points , representing some oscillators move forwards and some of them move backwards with respect to the mean field .",
    "hence , there are two values of @xmath61 where the velocity in this frame changes its sign , and one of these values corresponds to stable state and another corresponds to an unstable one .",
    "so , the oscillators having these phase values are in rest .",
    "other oscillators move towards the stable state and therefore merge into a cluster .",
    "since clusters in this setup are not possible , the assumption @xmath60 can not be true .",
    "hence , either all oscillators move faster than the mean field or all of them move slower , i.e. @xmath58 . a detailed quantitative analysis of system ( [ e1_2 ] ) can be found in @xcite .",
    "it is important to notice that the phase model   is only an approximation of the full system of eqs .   for the case",
    "when the amplitude dynamics is enslaved .",
    "in this situation the amplitude perturbations decay rapidly , and instability of the fully synchronous state occurs due to one real eigenvalue , corresponding to the phase ( as described in the next section ) .",
    "thus , for weak coupling we can expect that the above described soq dynamics appears close to instability of the synchronous state of the full system , when one real multiplier becomes larger than unity .",
    "here we denote such dynamics as qps - i , to be distinguished from another quasiperiodic state , discussed below .",
    "however , the correspondence between qps - i and soq is not exact , as due to corrections to the first - order model  , some fine features may become different .",
    "for example , while in model   several clusters are not possible due to the watanabe - strogatz theory , already small perturbations to the model generally destroy this property and enable clustering .",
    "we analyze stability of the fully synchronous state eq .",
    "( [ e1_1 ] ) with respect to the evaporation of individual oscillators from the synchronous cluster .",
    "in fact , one can always consider purely transversal evaporation modes such that the mean field @xmath14 remains unchanged .",
    "substituting @xmath62 , we make transformation to the coordinate frame , rotating with the frequency @xmath12 , where @xmath12 is given by eq .",
    "( [ e1_1 ] ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in the new frame",
    ", synchronous motion corresponds to a resting point ; we choose the coordinate system so that @xmath66 . linearizing the equation around this point",
    "while keeping @xmath67 , we obtain after straightforward manipulations the eigenvalues @xmath68 related to evaporation multipliers as @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the oscillation period  @xcite .",
    "if both eigenvalues   are negative , the fully synchronous cluster is stable .",
    "the instability occurs when either one real eigenvalue becomes positive , or a pair of complex eigenvalues crosses the imaginary axis .",
    "the situation when one real eigenvalue @xmath71 changes from negative to positive value is exactly the transition described in section  [ sec : soq ] above .",
    "one can check that the condition @xmath72 in in the limit of small coupling terms @xmath73 is exactly the condition @xmath53 where @xmath28 is defined according to .",
    "the comprehensive analysis of eqs .",
    "( [ e2],[eigenv ] ) is hardly feasible due to a large number of parameters .",
    "therefore , we consider here below only a special case of isochronous oscillators , @xmath74 , which demonstrates both types of synchrony - breaking transition , of our interest in this study . additionally , we fix @xmath75 , i.e. take purely dissipative nonlinear coupling . furthermore , we consider @xmath76 . then , with account of eq .",

    "for example , for some small parameter domain we have observed coexistence of both types of qps dynamics .",
    "we can not exclude other interesting dynamical regimes , but we believe that we have described the dominating solutions .",
    "in this paper we analyzed two regimes of partially synchronous states in globally coupled identical oscillator populations .",
    "these regimes can be attributed to a type of bifurcation at the transition from full to partial synchrony : qps - i corresponds to one real evaporation eigenvalue becoming positive , while regime qps - ii corresponds to two complex evaporation eigenvalues crossing real axis ( in terms of multipliers , one real multiplier becomes larger than one or two complex multipliers become larger than one in absolute values ) .",
    "these transitions are roughly related to two typical bifurcations from a steady state to a periodic dynamics : sniper ( saddle - node - infinite - period ) and hopf bifurcations .",
    "the main difference is that in ensembles of oscillators the transition is extremely high - dimensional ( in fact , infinite - dimensional in the thermodynamic limit ) so that usual low - dimensional bifurcation theory does not apply . in particular , while we can reliably describe some robust dynamical features like frequency difference between the mean field and the individual oscillators , other fine dynamical features such as appearance of clusters seem to be non - universal and strongly model - dependent .    for example",
    ", the simplest setup for the description of the regime qps - i is the nonlinear extension of the kuramoto - sakaguchi model eq .",

    "certainly , the same can be said if one goes beyond the phase dynamics approximation and analyzes globally coupled multidimensional oscillators . to the type ( iii ) belong also chimera states @xcite , originally described for non - locally coupled oscillators and for interacting subpopulations . in a chimera - like state of a globally coupled ensemble , one cluster coexists with a scattered sub - population . this regime can be considered as a special case of partial synchrony ; recently studied examples include ensembles of phase oscillators with delay @xcite and ensembles of sl systems  @xcite .",

    "notice that the transition from the asynchronous state to the stable synchronous state happens when one real eigenvalue becomes negative .",
    "remarkably , in case of chaos the dynamics also possesses the property , characteristic of the qps - i regime : the frequencies of the mean field and of the units are different . for an example we take the model   with @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 . for these parameter values the dynamics of both oscillators and of the collective mode is chaotic , see fig .",
    "[ fig : nk1]a .",
    "computation of average frequencies @xmath56 and @xmath12 shows that @xmath144 .",
    "this fact obviously follows from the plots of @xmath145 $ ] , @xmath146 $ ] , see fig .",
    "[ fig : nk1]b : when the amplitude of an oscillator becomes relatively small due to chaos , the phase slip occurs because the mean field makes an additional rotation with respect to the oscillator .",
    "this picture agrees with a qualitative description of phase synchronization of chaos @xcite , where the effect of chaotic amplitudes is considered as an effective noise which causes phase slips .",
    "phase slips of chaotic oscillators with respect to the mean field can be also observed for intrinsically chaotic systems , e.g. , for a ensemble of globally coupled rssler oscillators .",
    "finally , we notice that quasiperiodic partially synchronous states can appear without synchrony - breaking transition .",
    "the most known example is the van vreeswijk model @xcite of leaky integrate - and - fire neurons where the quasiperiodic motion emerges from the splay state .    in summary",
    ", we have analyzed a model of nonlinearly - coupled limit - cycle oscillators and revealed two routes to two quasiperiodic states via synchrony breaking .",
    "these states appear via two different bifurcations .",
    "moreover , we have shown the transition between qps - i and qps - ii states , as well as domains of bistability .",
