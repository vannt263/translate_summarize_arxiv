    "clusters of galaxies have been used for many years as tracers of the large - scale mass distribution in the universe . as the largest gravitationally bound objects",
    "their clustering statistics provide important information on the hierarchical process of galaxy formation enabling estimates to be made of the mass fluctuation amplitude and the density paramter @xmath15 ( e.g. mo et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the early statistical analyses relied on the visual cluster compilations of abell ( 1958 ) and abell , olowin & corwin ( 1989 ) . from the redshift surveys of richness - limited subsamples of the abell catalogue ( bahcall & soniera 1983 , klypin & kopylov 1983 , postman et al .",
    "1992 , peacock & west 1992 ) it was established that the correlation function @xmath0 followed the form @xmath16 on scales @xmath17 mpc with @xmath18 and @xmath12 systematically 5 times higher than the value of @xmath19 mpc found for galaxies ( e.g. davis & peebles 1983 , tucker et al .",
    "1997 ) , but with a strong dependency on the limiting richness of the cluster sample used ( see bahcall 1988 ) .",
    "for example , while the richness class @xmath20 samples give @xmath21mpc , at the higher threshold @xmath22 the correlation length rises to @xmath23mpc ( peacock & west 1992 ) . in principle these results can be used to place constraints on theoretical models of large - scale structure , however the cosmological information they contain is questionable due to the likely existence of inhomogeneities ( sutherland 1988 , sutherland & efstathiou 1991 ) and line - of - sight projection effects ( lucey 1983 , dekel et al .",
    "1990 ) artificially enhancing the correlation amplitude of abell - based cluster samples .",
    "strong evidence that these effects play a significant role comes from comparing the amplitude of the correlation function @xmath24 in the redshift direction @xmath25 of space with the perpendicular direction @xmath26 .",
    "both rich and poor abell cluster samples regularly fail this isotropy test , showing line - of - sight elongations in the contours of @xmath24 .",
    "these features are consistent with an artificial enhancement of the correlation function ( sutherland 1988 , efstathiou et al .",
    "1992 , peacock & west 1992 ) although physical interpretations have also been suggested ( bahcall et al .",
    "1986 , miller et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the advent of digitised cluster surveys saw a dramatic increase in the homogeneity with which optical cluster samples could be compiled .",
    "results from both the edinburgh / durham cluster catalogue ( nichol et al . 1992 ) and the apm survey ( dalton et al .",
    "1992 , 1994 , croft et al .",
    "1997 ) demonstrated that for the equivalent abell richness class @xmath20 , clusters found from automated detection algorithms have @xmath27mpc with significantly reduced anisotropies .",
    "testing the results of the richer clusters has proved more difficult due to the large search volume required to find suitable numbers and the diminishing contrast of distant clusters against the background of faint galaxies .",
    "for example , croft et al . (",
    "1997 ) used 46 apm clusters with richnesses equivalent to @xmath22 and found @xmath28 .",
    "in recent years attention has focused on cluster samples generated on the basis of their x - ray emission .",
    "this method has enormous advantages for the determination of @xmath29 over the optically compiled cluster catalogues described above :    * the x - ray emission from a cluster provides a direct physical link with the presence of a large gravitational potential in quasi - equilibrium ( e.g. @xmath30 ) .",
    "thus the signature of x - ray emission provides strong evidence that the apparent overdensities seen in the optical are gravitationally bound structures . *",
    "the emissivity of thermal bremsstrahlung radiation is proportional to the square of the electron number density , whereas the optical richness estimates are simply proportional to the galaxy density .",
    "therefore , at fixed density , the contamination in cluster samples resulting from the projection of systems along the line - of - sight is intrinsically higher in richness - based optical samples compared to x - ray cluster catalogues .",
    "furthermore the x - ray emission from clusters is concentrated towards the dense central cores which are typically @xmath31 kpc in size ",
    "significantly smaller than the spatial extent of the galaxy concentration in clusters .",
    "both these effects substantially reduce the chance of projection effects which , as described above , are thought to plague abell - based samples . * the comparatively low internal background of the rosat position sensitive proportinal counter ( pspc ) and",
    "the relatively short exposure times in the all - sky survey means that the x - ray fluxes from clusters at the flux limit of reflex are photon - noise limited as opposed to background limited .",
    "this is in contrast to purely optically selected samples which are forced to have a minimum density contrast above a varying background of galaxies before they can be detected .",
    "the first attempts to measure @xmath29 using x - ray clusters were confined to small samples : lahav et al .",
    "( 1989 ) detected significant clustering with @xmath32 for @xmath33 using an all - sky sample of 53 clusters above a flux @xmath34 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 ( 2 - 10 kev ) .",
    "nichol , briel & henry ( 1994 ) used rosat data for a complete sample of 67 x - ray bright abell clusters finding a correlation length @xmath35 mpc and detecting no significant clustering anisotropy . a more extensive study using data from the rosat satellite carried out by romer et al .",
    "( 1994 ) for a nearly complete flux - limited sample of 129 clusters above @xmath36 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 found @xmath37mpc , @xmath38 .",
    "this study also found no evidence of spatial anisotropy in the clustering pattern .",
    "more recently , there have been two independent estimates of @xmath29 from the 277 x - ray brightest abell cluster sample from the rass ( xbacs , ebeling et al .",
    "1996 ) . for this sample abadi et al .",

    "1999 ) have the advantage that the sky coverage is known from accurate information on the x - ray flux limit pertaining to any part of the sky .    the first attempt to utilise",
    "the rass sky coverage information is moscardini et .",
    "al . ( 2000a ) , who analyse the spatial distribution of the clusters in the rass1 bright sample ( de grandi et al .",
    "1999 ) using a very simple version of the sky coverage based on the first processing of the all - sky survey .",
    "this cluster catalogue is the forerunner to reflex consisting of 130 clusters to a limit @xmath44 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 defined in the rosat hard energy band ( @xmath45 kev ) and covering an area covering 2.5 sr centred on the southern galactic cap .",
    "moscardini et al .",
    "( 2000a ) find @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( @xmath48 errors ) with a mild dependence of @xmath12 on limiting flux and luminosity .",
    "the reflex survey provides the opportunity to substantially improve on this result in a number of important respects : ( i ) reflex provides more than 3 times the number of x - ray clusters over a contiguous area nearly twice as large .",
    "( ii ) all rass standard analysis source detections are reanalysed using our own flux determination method .",
    "( iii ) due account is taken of all exposure variations , in contrast to the the rass1 sample which is limited to exposure times larger than 150 secs .",
    "( iv ) the optical identification is done in a homogeneous way based on the most comprehensive optical data base available for the southern sky . the power spectrum for reflex",
    "is presented elsewhere ( schuecker et al . 2000 ) , here we concentrate on the correlation function .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we give a brief description of the reflex cluster survey . in section 3",
    "we discuss the algorithm used to esimate the the correlation function and the results for both the entire reflex catalogue and volume limited sub - samples are presented in section 4 .",
    "the interpretation of these results in terms of structure formation models is discussed in section 5 .",
    "the reflex survey represents an objective flux - limited catalogue of x - ray clusters in the southern hemisphere south of declination + 2.5 degs and excluding the region within @xmath49 deg of the galactic plane .",
    "a further @xmath50 deg@xmath51 of sky around the lmc and smc is removed where x - ray detection is hampered by the high interstellar absorption and crowded star fields .",
    "the remaining area covered by the survey is 13924 deg@xmath51 or 4.24 sr , representing @xmath52 of the entire sky .",
    "the primary x - ray data for reflex originates from the second processing of the rosat all - sky - survey ( rass2 ) using the standard analysis software system ( sass ) which is based on a maximum likelihood detection algorithm .",
    "confirmed rass2 sources with a likelihood parameter of at least 15 and count rate @xmath53 cts s@xmath2 in the @xmath4 kev energy band have already been published in the rass bright source catalogue ( voges et al .",
    "for reflex we use the internal mpe source catalogue totalling 54076 sources in the study area which allows the inclusion of sources with a likelihood @xmath54 .",
    "although some sources will be detected at a significance @xmath55 and not all are real , this lower likelihood threshold ensures that the parent catalogue is as complete as possible .",
    "it is well known from previous studies that the rass analysis software is optimised for point - like sources and therefore underestimates the flux of extended sources ( e.g. ebeling et al .",
    "1996 , de grandi et al .",
    "therefore we have reanalysed all the source fluxes using a growth curve analysis method to recover the total flux of extended sources with an internal error of between @xmath56 ( bhringer et al .",
    "note : x - ray count rates are measured in the hard band ( @xmath45 kev ) then converted to unabsorbed fluxes in the rosat band ( @xmath4 kev ) and the cluster x - ray luminosities are determined by an iterative procedure using the luminosity - temperature relation of markevitch ( 1998 ) assuming @xmath57 ( bhringer et al .",
    "2000c in preparation ) , with the values scaled by a factor 0.25 to @xmath58 in this paper . excluding double detections we have 4206 sources above a count rate limit of 0.08 cts s@xmath2 , which corresponds to a flux limit between @xmath59 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "the optical identification is based on finding galaxy overdensities in concentric rings around x - ray source positions using the uk schmidt j - survey photographic plates digitised by cosmos which reduces the total number of cluster candidates to @xmath60 above a flux limit @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 in the rosat energy band @xmath4 kev .",
    "details of the optical identification process are given elsewhere ( bhringer et al .",
    "2000b ) .    to carry out further indentification and obtain redshifts , multi - object",
    "( @xmath61 galaxies per cluster ) and single - slit ( @xmath62 galaxies per cluster ) spectroscopy was carried out on @xmath63 targets as part of an eso key programme ( bhringer et al .",
    "1998 , guzzo et al . 1999 ) .",
    "this results in 452 clusters above @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 in the energy band @xmath4 kev , of which 449 have secure redshifts either from our eso programme or from the literature . about @xmath64 of these clusters",
    "are in the abell catalogue while most of the others were previously unknown .    a comprehensive discussion of the contamination and completeness statistics in reflex is given in bhringer et al .",
    "( 2000b ) and results on the comoving number density of clusters in the survey are presented in schuecker et al .",
    "these indicate a completeness well in excess of @xmath65 and a contamination by non - cluster x - ray sources of less than @xmath66 .",
    "we mention a few results here to serve as an illustration of the quality of the catalogue : ( i ) from a search for x - ray emission around all aco and aco supplimentary clusters only 1 cluster with an x - ray flux more than the flux limit is not found by the selection process .",
    "( ii ) clusters in the luminosity range @xmath67 erg s@xmath2 have a constant comoving number density of objects and v / vmax=@xmath68 at the flux limit of the survey .",
    "this is consistent with the lack of evolution seen in the x - ray luminosity function out to at least @xmath69 reported by other surveys ( _ e.g. _ burke et al .",
    "1997 , ebeling et al . 1997 ) .",
    "( iii ) approximately @xmath70 of the reflex clusters are extended  we searched the rass2 database separately for extended x - ray sources finding only a further 8 bona - fide clusters and 5 candidate clusters , 3 of which show no obvious optical counterpart and for which futher deep imaging is planned .",
    "one complication with the rass is that the sky coverage is not homogeneous resulting in about @xmath71 of the reflex survey region having an exposure time less than half of the median exposure time ( @xmath72 s ) .",
    "this , coupled with the varying galactic hydrogen coloumn density , results in a variation of the limiting flux of the rass2 across the sky .",
    "although the very low background for the rosat pspc , especially in the hard band ( @xmath45 kev ) , allows the detection and characterisation of sources with comparitavely low source source counts a minimum number is required for a safe detection .",
    "[ effective ] shows the resulting effective area of the reflex survey as a function of flux with the additional criterion imposed of detecting at least 10 photons in the hard band .",
    "the exposure times of the rass2 in the reflex area are sufficient that at a flux limit of @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 at least 10 photons are detected for @xmath73 of the reflex survey area and hence the number of clusters detected with low photon counts is very small  3.8 clusters with less than 10 counts are expected in the survey and only 1 is detected . for a more conservative requirement of at least 30 photons for each source",
    "the sky coverage falls to @xmath74 ( see bhringer et al .",
    "2000b ) .      in all computations",
    "we use the estimator    @xmath75    where dd stands for the number of distinct pairs in the data , rr stands for the number of distinct pairs in the random catalogue and dr represents the number of cross pairs .",
    "the factor of 4 in this expression accounts for the fact that while the number of distinct pairs in a large catalogue of size @xmath76 , say , is @xmath77 , the number of cross - pairs between two different catalogues each with @xmath76 entries is @xmath78 and these are all distinct . since the correlation function is defined in terms of the total number of pairs , the number of distinct @xmath79 and @xmath80 pairs must each be multiplied by 2 to obtain the total numbers , hence the factor of 4 .",
    "this estimator has been shown by hamilton ( 1993 ) to be the most robust for datasets which may be sensitive to the chance location of strong clustering close to the sample boundary .    in principle",
    "the estimator in equation [ hamilton ] can be generalised to include an arbitrary weighting function . for calculating the correlation function of galaxies from magnitude - limited samples , the variance in the estimate of @xmath8 on large scales",
    "is minimised if @xmath81 is    @xmath82    where @xmath83 is the distance of an object from the origin , @xmath84 is the distance separating two objects , @xmath85 is the survey selection function , @xmath86 the mean space density of objects and @xmath87 ( see saunders , rowan - robinson & lawrence 1992 , fisher et al .",
    "1994 , guzzo et al .",
    "the physical interpretation of the term @xmath88 in the weighting scheme is that it represents something like ` the mean number of objects per clump ' . for galaxies",
    "this number is large on small scales giving equal volume weighting to the pairs ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "by contrast , for clusters the weighting term @xmath88 is always small compared to unity on scales of interest and consequently we assign equal weight to all pairs in the calculation of the cluster correlation function .",

    "is assumed that the observed number count distribution of x - ray clusters , logn - logs , is well fitted by a simple lower - law :    @xmath96    for the purposes here we adopt the value @xmath97 , consistent with the reflex number counts ( see bhringer et al .",
    "2000b ) and those of rass1 , the precursor survey of reflex ( de grandi et al .",
    "small changes to the value of @xmath98 does not alter the outcome of the results .",
    "if we assume that the accumulative distribution @xmath99 defined as    @xmath100    is uniformly distributed in the range @xmath101 , then the distribution of cluster x - ray fluxes @xmath102 selected at random above @xmath103 is given by    @xmath104    we select a cluster at random within the allowed borders of the reflex survey and then use eqn .  [ simulate ] to assign it a flux .",
    "we then test whether the cluster falls above or below the flux limit for that region of the reflex survey based on the local values of exposure time and the interstellar hydrogen column density ( dickey & lockman 1990 , stark et al .",
    "we set @xmath105 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 , which is the cut - off flux limit for the entire survey .",

    "the random catalogues used in the determination of @xmath29 contain typically 100,000 points .",
    "we use two methods to assign each random point a redshift .",
    "( i ) redshifts are drawn from the distribution of reflex clusters smoothed with a gaussian kernel .",
    "this method allows the redshift selection function to be estimated without prior knowledge of the underlying density distribution of clusters and is used in almost all previous determinations of the cluster correlation function . for reflex",
    "we use a gaussian of width 5600 km s@xmath2  the optimum value depends on the space density of clusters and is constrained by the need to follow the redshift distribution accurately enough while not removing large - scale clustering .",
    "the exact figure used is generally not critical , with values in the literature ranging between @xmath106 km s@xmath2 .",
    "( ii ) the second method , which we apply to luminosity limited samples , uses the x - ray cluster luminosity function to generate the expected number of clusters at each redshift .",
    "assuming a schechter function of the form    @xmath107    where @xmath108 is the number density of clusters per luminosity interval , then for particular values of @xmath98 and @xmath109 , we can integrate @xmath110 above @xmath111 to determine the number density of clusters at each redshift @xmath112 .",

    "the danger with such an approach is that the resulting estimates of parameters describing the power - law ( @xmath128 ) will then depend on the precise details of the binning . in order to overcome this limitation",

    "moscardini et al .",
    "the likelihood estimate is based on poisson probabilities , such that    @xmath130    where @xmath131 is the observed number of cluster - cluster pairs in a small interval @xmath132 and @xmath133 is the expected number in the same interval calculated using hamilton s estimator ( eqn .",

    "the resulting power - law fit to the correlation function out to @xmath169 mpc gives @xmath170 @xmath171 , smaller than the reflex amplitude of @xmath172 and very close to the original sgp result of @xmath173 mpc , @xmath38 found by r94 fitting over the same range .",
    "this suggests that the difference between the reflex and the sgp result is most likely due to the superior statistical sampling of reflex which represents a 4-fold increase in survey area over the sgp region while probing to a similar redshift .",

    "( 2000 ) analyse the @xmath24 diagram for a number of x - ray cluster samples . in their analysis",
    "the xbacs clusters show very strong elongations around @xmath174 in the redshift direction and a similar anisotropy is present in other x - ray confirmed abell cluster samples .",
    "the rass1 sample shows a much weaker anisotropy over the same scale . on the basis of this miller et al .",
    "( 2000 ) argue that clustering anisotropy is a ubiquitous feature of x - ray cluster samples which demonstrates that the anisotropies are real .",
    "however , the absence of any significant anisotropy in the contours of @xmath24 for the reflex survey shown in fig .  [ pisig ] indicates that this is not the case .",
    "this is the strongest indication yet that elongations seen in other catalogues are spurious and justifies the claim , first pointed out by r94 , that x - ray selected surveys do not suffer from significant projection biases . as with optical studies based on the abell catalogue ,",
    "the presence of strong elongations close to the scale of @xmath12 in the xbacs bring the accuracy of the clustering signal derived from this sample into question .",
    "predictions for the clustering properties of x - ray selected clusters from a number of surveys , including reflex , have recently been made by moscardini et al .",
    "( 2000b ) . in these predictions",
    "the structures on a given scale are assumed to evolve by hierarchical merging of smaller units and instantaneous merging on cluster scales .",
    "the comoving mass function of haloes is computed using the press - schechter ( 1974 ) technique but incorporating more recent corrections which improve the comparison of press - schechter with numerical simulations ( e.g. sheth & tormen 1999 ) .",
    "the link between x - ray luminosity and mass of the hosting dark matter halo begins with the empirical relation between gas temperature @xmath175 and x - ray luminosity @xmath176    @xmath177    with @xmath178 & @xmath179 , which is a good approximation for clusters ( e.g. david et al .",
    "1993 ; white , jones & forman 1997 ; markevitch 1998 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath131 describing the evolution of the @xmath180 relation is constrained by moscardini et al .",

    "an examination of these figures reveals clear evidence for an inconsistency between all @xmath183 models and the reflex correlation function , with a significantly better fit to the data for open or @xmath185-dominated cosmologies .",
    "this is further illustrated in fig .",
    "[ cdmr0 ] which shows the moscardini et al .",
    "( 2000b ) predictions of correlation length with limiting x - ray flux .",
    "while the einstein - de sitter models predict @xmath187mpc , both the ocdm and @xmath185cdm models predict @xmath188mpc .",
    "these results are in agreement with the analysis of the x - ray clusters based on the rass1 bright sample ( moscardini et al . 2000a ) and the digitised optical surveys ( e.g. croft et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "confirmation of the general conclusions on the form of the cosmological power spectrum comes from the behaviour of of @xmath29 on large scales . in fig .",
    "[ cross ] we show the reflex @xmath0 at low amplitude which shows a positive clustering signal out to at least @xmath189 mpc ( @xmath190 ) , with a zero - crossing @xmath191 ( @xmath192 ) . on larger scales",
    "the amplitude remains slightly negative ( @xmath193 ) .",

    "( 2000b ) for the ocdm and @xmath185cdm models .",
    "since the scdm model predicts a zero - crossing near @xmath196mpc ( klypin & rhee 1994 ) , the reflex data again support the findings of other cluster surveys that models with more power than scdm are required to adequately fit the large - scale @xmath0 .",
    "generally for cdm - like models ( with @xmath197 for the primordial spectral index ) the first zero - point occurs at @xmath198 for a vanishing baryon fraction ( see klypin & rhee 1994 ) . for the particular parameterisation used by moscardini et al .",
    "( 2000b ) the ocdm and @xmath185cdm models remain positive until @xmath199 mpc , however the small clustering amplitude in the data between @xmath200 mpc seen in fig .",
    "[ cross ] prohibits any definitive comparison of the zero crossings .",
    "catalogues of galaxy clusters based on their x - ray emission provide a powerful tool for studies of large - scale structure .",
    "we present the spatial correlation function of the reflex cluster survey , which consists of 449 x - ray emitting clusters above a flux limit @xmath201 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 and covering a contiguous area of 4.24 sr in the southern hemisphere .",
    "the advantages of x - ray selection , combined with the increased statistics and high completeness of reflex enable a significant step to be taken in establishing the clustering properties of clusters in the local universe . over the scale @xmath145 mpc we find a correlation amplitude @xmath10 and power law index @xmath146 for the entire survey .",
    "the high degree of isotropy in the correlation function demonstrates that systematic projection effects are not present in the data . by analysing volume - limited sub - samples we find no significant trend of clustering amplitude with x - ray luminosity . comparing the reflex @xmath29 results with predictions from various cdm - type models which incorporate directly the areal coverage of reflex ,",
    "@xmath14 models provide an excellent fit , while @xmath13 & @xmath202 models fail to provide enough large - scale power .",
    "finally , it is intriguing to note the concensus emerging between clustering studies and the lack of evolution in the abundance of x - ray clusters ( e.g. burke et al .",
