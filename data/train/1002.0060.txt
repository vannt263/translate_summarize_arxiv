    "one of the most common properties of attractive fermion many - body system is the arising of superfluid state at low temperature .",
    "depending on the strength of the attractive interaction between two fermions , however , the physical contents of the superfluid state could be distinguishably altered .",
    "when the interaction is weak , the system can be well described by the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory . in this case , the superfluidity is due to the condensate of loosely correlated cooper pairs and superfluid gap is much smaller than the fermi energy . when the interaction becomes sufficiently strong , the two - fermion bound state could form , which may behave like a boson . in this situation ,",
    "the superfluidity is due to the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of the tightly bound two - fermion state and the superfluid gap could be much larger than the fermi energy .",
    "although the bcs and bec limits have quite different physics , it was found that there is no true phase transition ( traditional symmetry breaking ) happening in between .",
    "the transition from bcs state to bec state is smooth and is often called the bcs - bec crossover  @xcite .",
    "such bcs - bec crossover was recently realized in cold atomic experiments ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it was well known that cold nuclear matter can be in a superfluid state , which plays a crucial role in a variety of nuclear many - body problems , from neutron stars , low - energy heavy - ion collisions , to finite nuclei .",
    "it was argued that the bcs - bec crossover should also occur in nuclear matter where the bcs state of neutron - proton ( @xmath2 ) cooper pairs at high density undergoes a smooth transition into bec state of deuterons at low density  @xcite . at the same time , the chemical potential changes its sign at a certain density and finally approaches one - half of the deuteron binding energy at the low - density limit .",
    "recently , a similar situation was also studied for the neutron - neutron ( @xmath3 ) pairs in the @xmath4 channel  @xcite .",
    "it was found that in certain ( low ) density regions the @xmath3 pairs can be strongly correlated .",
    "however , no assured bec state was found for @xmath3 pairs .",
    "so far , most of the investigations of nuclear bcs - bec crossover in the literatures focused on the ground state crossover described by bcs theory .",
    "although the bcs theory succeeds in describing the bcs - bec crossover at zero temperature , it , as a mean - field theory , is not sufficient to describe low - density nuclear matter at finite temperature where the pairing fluctuation is substantial due to the strongly correlating nature of the system . actually , as a consequence of the strong correlation , the low - density nuclear matter exhibits  pseudogap \" phenomena above the critical temperature @xmath5 of superfluid transition and has an exotic normal state that is different from the fermi liquid normal state associated with bcs theory  @xcite .",
    "similar situations were also found in other strongly correlated systems , such as high @xmath5 superconductors  @xcite and cold atomic fermi gases under feshbach resonances  @xcite . to include the pairing fluctuation effects and investigate the pseudogap phenomena",
    ", we will adopt a @xmath0-matrix formalism based on a @xmath1 approximation for the pair susceptibility which was first introduced by the chicago group  @xcite .",
    "this formalism generalizes the early works of kadanoff and martin  @xcite and patton  @xcite , and can be considered as a natural extension of the bcs theory since they share the same ground state . moreover",
    ", this formalism allows quasi - analytic calculations and gives a simple physical interpretation of the pseudogap phase .",
    "it clearly shows that the pseudogap is due to the incoherent pairing fluctuation .",
    "our focus will be put on the @xmath2 pair in symmetric nuclear matter ( mainly in the low - density region ) , since the interaction in this case is more attractive than in the @xmath3 or @xmath6 channels and it provides a very good playground for the bcs - bec crossover .",
    "we will extend the early studies  @xcite to include the pairing fluctuation effects and determine the magnitude of the pseudogap .",
    "furthermore , the transition temperature for the onset of the superfluid and the thermodynamic properties will be also be a concern .",

    "since @xmath95 is related to @xmath122 and the deuteron binding energy @xmath238 through @xmath239 , we get that the binding energy @xmath238 at zero temperature is roughly @xmath240 at @xmath230 from fig .",
    "the effective deuteron mass @xmath241 is shown in fig .",
    "it is seen that at low temperature @xmath175 is almost a constant , but it drops when temperature becomes higher .",
    "we note here that @xmath175 can be regarded as the medium renormalized deuteron mass only in deep bec region  @xcite .",
    "it is renormalized because it contains indirectly the deuteron - deuteron interaction through the nucleon - deuteron coupling in the nucleon self - energy .",
    "hence , this effective mass is not equal to @xmath242 , as one may intuitively expect .",
    "it is actually a parameter measuring the effective size of the non - condensed pairs , hence it is also defined in intermediate coupling and even weak coupling regions .",
    "the drop of @xmath175 at high temperature simply indicates that the effective size of the non - condensed pair is enlarged by the thermal motion of participate nucleons .     at density @xmath230.,width=283 ]     at density @xmath230.,width=283 ]    finally , we depict the entropy density and the specific heat for deuteron gas in fig .",
    "one should note that at low temperature , the behavior of @xmath139 is very different from the prediction of bcs theory : it shows @xmath243 dependence at low @xmath0 rather than an exponential suppression .",
    "actually , since the condensate does not contribute to entropy , @xmath139 at @xmath244 contains contributions from quasi - nucleons and from thermal excited pairs .",
    "the former contribution is just the bcs theory result , @xmath245 with @xmath246 .",

    "( [ eq : bec2 ] ) ] , hence @xmath248 which dominates @xmath139 at low temperature . at the phase transition point , similarly with unitary matter , due to the continuity of the temperature derivative of excitation gap , @xmath139 does not get a discontinuity , but a @xmath249-type behavior .",
    "now , both the low temperature and the critical behaviors of @xmath139 are quite similar with the situation found in ideal bec superfluid .",
    "it indicates that the symmetric nuclear matter at very low density is a nearly ideal deuteron gas .",

    "@xmath251 monotonously decreases and vanishes when density is smaller than @xmath252 which is just the unitary point .",

    "as is well known , bcs theory is only applicable to weak coupling system or at zero temperature since it does not contain any pairing fluctuation effects . to study the bcs - bec crossover at finite temperature ,",
    "it is necessary to go beyond bcs description .",
    "we , in this article , studied the effects of pseudogap due to pairing fluctuation on the bcs - bec crossover problem in symmetric nuclear matter . for this purpose",
    ", we adopted a @xmath0-matrix method based on a @xmath1 approximation for the pair susceptibility .",
    "this method is a natural extension of bcs theory and has been widely used in theoretical studies of high @xmath5 superconductor and bcs - bec crossover problems in cold fermion atoms .",
    "the pseudogap is determined by the density of thermally excited @xmath2 pairs and vanishes at zero temperature .",
    "we found that its effects are substantial for intermediate and strong coupling regions ( corresponding to intermediate and low - density regions ) in the bcs - bec crossover when temperature is not zero . at high - density region ,",
    "the pseudogap is essentially small , and the @xmath1 theory recovers the bcs theory . taking into account the pseudogap effects , we calculated the critical temperature for superfluid phase transition shown in fig .",
    "[ tc ] . at high density",
    ", @xmath5 follows the bcs result , but at intermediate and low densities , it deviates from the bcs prediction remarkably . at dilute limit , @xmath5 coincides with the bec transition temperature of dilute deuterons .",
    "the pseudogap persists in both @xmath124 and @xmath221 regions .",
    "we investigated how the pseudogap affects the properties of unitary matter and dilute deuteron matter . at intermediate and low densities ,",
    "the significant result is that due to the pseudogap , the specific heat is continuous at @xmath5 . at low density , @xmath253 at low temperature and has a continuous @xmath249-type behavior at @xmath5 just like an ideal bec superfluid .",
    "the qualitative change of the temperature dependence of specific heat from high density to low density also indicates the bcs - bec crossover .",
    "moreover , as density decreases , the jump of specific heat at @xmath5 decreases and eventually disappears when @xmath254 as shown in fig .",
    "[ deltcv ] .",
    "this may serve as a thermodynamic signal for bcs - bec crossover .",
    "we stress that the @xmath1 approximation is , in principle , not applicable at temperature much higher than @xmath5 , since then the thermal dissociation effect will result in a finite width of the pairs which we did not take into account .",
    "besides , symmetric nuclear matter may favor the formation of @xmath255 cluster  @xcite , but we did not consider this situation in present article . finally , since most of the nuclear systems in nature do not contain equal numbers of neutrons and protons , it will be significant to extend present formalism to asymmetric nuclear matter  @xcite .",
