    "despite the absence of an explicit minimization principle , variational methods have been used successfully in many problems of quantum scattering theory .",
    "such calculations typically exploit a stationary principle in order to obtain an accurate description of scattering processes .",
    "the kohn variational method @xcite has been applied extensively to problems in electron - atom @xcite and electron - molecule @xcite scattering , as well as to the scattering of positrons , @xmath1 , by atoms @xcite and molecules @xcite .",
    "it has been widely documented , however , that matrix equations derived from the kohn variational principle are inherently susceptible to spurious singularities .",
    "these singularities were discussed first by schwartz @xcite and have subsequently attracted considerable attention @xcite . in the region of these singularities",
    ", results of kohn calculations can be anomalous .",
    "although sharing characteristics similar to those exhibited by scattering resonances @xcite , schwartz singularities are nonphysical and arise only because the trial wavefunction , used in kohn calculations to represent scattering , is inexact @xcite . for projectiles of a given incident energy ,",
    "anomalous results are confined to particular formulations of the trial wavefunction and can , in principle , be mitigated by a small change in boundary conditions or some other parameter .",
    "it has also been shown @xcite that the use of a complex - valued trial wavefunction avoids anomalous behaviour except in exceptional circumstances .",
    "alternative versions of the kohn method have been developed in terms of a feshbach projection operator formalism @xcite and have been found @xcite to give anomaly - free results .    in this article",
    "we will discuss our investigations of schwartz - type anomalies for generalized kohn calculations involving the elastic scattering of positrons by molecular hydrogen , @xmath2 .",
    "we will find that our choice of trial wavefunction contains a free parameter that can be varied in such a way as to produce singularities which are legitimate in the context of the scattering theory and which do not give rise to anomalous results . indeed",
    ", these singularities can be used to formulate an optimization scheme for choosing the free parameter so as to automatically avoid anomalous behaviour in calculations of the scattering phase shift .",
    "the novelty of determining the phase shift in this way is that an explicit solution of the linear system of kohn equations is not required .",
    "we will also develop an alternative optimization and show that the two schemes give results in close agreement .",
    "further , the results obtained will be seen to be in excellent agreement at all positron energies with those determined via the complex kohn method .",
    "we will give examples of anomalous behaviour which can not be avoided with either optimization , and show that the same anomalies appear in our application of the complex kohn method .",
    "we will discuss circumstances under which these anomalies might occur .",
    "we will show also that such results are nonphysical by considering small changes in the nonlinear parameters of the trial wavefunction .",
    "our investigations of singular behaviour have been carried out as part of a wider study on @xmath0scattering and annihilation using extremely flexible wavefunctions . our ability to recognize clearly and analyze the anomalous behaviour is as good for this system as it would be for a simpler model system , with the advantage that our calculations can be used to provide meaningful and physically relevant results @xcite .",

    "the standard approach in kohn calculations is to assume an overall form for @xmath3that depends linearly on a set of unknown parameters , optimal values for which are then determined by the application of a stationary principle .    in our investigations of anomalous behaviour in kohn calculations for @xmath0scattering",
    ", we have studied the lowest partial wave of @xmath5 symmetry .",
    "this partial wave has been shown @xcite to be the only significant contributor to scattering processes for incident positron energies below @xmath6 ev .",
    "the first significant inelastic channel is positronium formation which has a threshold at @xmath7 ev @xcite .",
    "although we will here consider positron energies higher than these thresholds , it is not our intention to provide a comprehensive physical treatment of the scattering problem taking higher partial waves and inelastic processes into account .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to give a correct and , as far as possible , anomaly - free treatment of the lowest partial wave .",
    "it is important to examine the single channel case as accurately as possible as a preliminary for more sophisticated calculations . by not taking into account additional channels ,",
    "it is possible that anomalous behaviour could occur due to physical inaccuracies in the trial wavefunction at higher energies .",

    "away from the spurious singularities , for an accurate trial wavefunction we can expect the variation in the calculated values of ps . over @xmath31 to be small . in the original application of the kohn method @xcite , only wavefunctions corresponding to @xmath32 were considered .",

    "what follows , the particular choice of the 1-norm in our calculations will implicitly be assumed .",

    "a number of methods are available . in principle ,",
    "anomalous behaviour can be reduced dramatically by allowing the kohn trial wavefunction to be complex - valued @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach for avoiding anomalies persistent in @xmath31 is to make a small change in some other parameter of the trial wavefunction .",
    "we will explore both of these techniques in the following section .",
    "the complex kohn method is an extension of the original variational approach in which the boundary conditions of the trial wavefunction are complex .",
    "it was originally believed @xcite that this method was anomaly - free , although anomalies were subsequently reported by lucchese @xcite . for our complex kohn calculations on @xmath0scattering ,",

    "the unknowns @xmath181 and @xmath182 will not , in general , be real .",

    "hence , singularities are obtained only if both the real and imaginary parts of @xmath192 are zero ; they can neither be located nor avoided by varying only @xmath31 .",
    "we would therefore expect anomalous results due to singularities arising from the choice of @xmath31 at a given @xmath27 to be eliminated in the complex kohn method .",
    "however , from ( [ eq : dabc ] ) we would also expect @xmath192 to be close to zero at @xmath126 , in the same sense that @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 have already been seen to be close to zero at this value of @xmath27 .",

    "we have found that the differences in the calculated values of ps . at different values of @xmath10 are negligible , for all positron momenta considered here . without loss of generality , we can regard the complex kohn calculation as effectively independent of @xmath31 and choose @xmath32 for simplicity . in figure",

    "as expected , the complex kohn method automatically avoids anomalies at most values of @xmath27 without the need for an optimization of @xmath31 .",
    "nevertheless , the use of the complex trial function has predictably failed to remove the persistent anomaly at @xmath126 . in figure",
    "[ fig : d ] we verify that @xmath195 is anomalously small at @xmath154 for @xmath32 .",
    "we have found that differences between the results shown in figure [ fig : d ] and values of @xmath195 calculated at other values of @xmath31 are negligible .",
    "over @xmath27 for @xmath32 . ]    having failed to find a systematic remedy for the persistent anomalous behaviour , we consider a more _ ad hoc _ approach .",
    "it should be possible to avoid any schwartz - type anomaly by some variation of parameters in the trial wavefunction .",

    "@xmath197 away from this curve , the calculations are free of anomalies .",
    "hence , a small change in the values of @xmath196 or @xmath197 can indeed be shown to successfully avoid persistent anomalous behaviour .     at @xmath126 . ]    finally , we consider briefly that the shielding parameter , @xmath23 , in ( [ eq : cosopenchannel ] ) and ( [ eq : chi ] ) might also be varied in an effort to avoid anomalous behaviour .",
    "values of ps . at @xmath126 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 for @xmath205 are shown in figure [ fig : varygamma ] .",
    "it is apparent that small changes in the value of @xmath23 have relatively little effect on the persistent anomaly at @xmath126 .",
    "this is not unexpected , being consistent with the findings of lucchese @xcite , who investigated the effect of varying a parameter analogous to @xmath23 in his model potential calculations .",
    "he noted that singularities due to the choice of @xmath23 occurred when the values of @xmath23 and @xmath196 were not similar , most typically when @xmath206 . with this in mind , and from inspection of figures [ fig : psssurf ] and [ fig : varygamma ] , we can conclude that the anomaly observed in figure [ fig : methcomp ] is due primarily to the choices of @xmath196 and @xmath197 rather than the choice of @xmath23 .",
    "we have carried out a thorough examination of singularities and related anomalous behaviour in generalized kohn calculations for @xmath0scattering . we have argued that singularities do not always occur spuriously and that variational calculations of the scattering phase shift can be anomaly - free at these singularities .",
    "subsequently , we have developed an optimization scheme for choosing a free parameter of the trial wavefunction allowing anomaly - free values of the phase shift to be determined without the need to solve the linear system of equations derived from the kohn variational principle .",
    "this approach has been seen to be largely successful , giving phase shifts in close agreement with those determined by a conventional generalization of the kohn method , as well as those obtained with the complex kohn method .",
    "persistent anomalies in both sets of calculations have been identified and attributed to singularities that can not be avoided with any choice of the parameter , @xmath31 .",
    "further , we have found that our implementation of the complex kohn method is susceptible to the same behaviour .",
    "we have demonstrated , however , that persistent anomalies can be avoided by small changes in the nonlinear parameters of the short - range correlation functions .",
    "hence , by studying the behaviour of @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 over @xmath27 , we can predict the appearance of persistent anomalous behaviour quantitatively and avoid it by an appropriate change in @xmath196 or @xmath197 .",
