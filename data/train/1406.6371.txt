    "the potential afforded by bayesian techniques for inferring the properties of infinite - dimensional mathematical structures , such as random fields ( to be understood here as random functions defined at each point of some finite - dimensional metric space ) , has long been recognised by both probability theorists , e.g.  @xcite , and practitioners : with the first wave of practical applications in geoscience ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite ) and machine learning ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite ) contemporaneous with the advent of sufficiently powerful desktop computers .",
    "cosmologists were at this time notable as _ ` early adopters ' _ and pioneers of the new techniques for field inference .",
    "indeed , the monte carlo methods for constrained simulation from gaussian random fields developed by @xcite and @xcite remain key tools for efficient conditional simulation , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "however , over the past decade the sophistication of statistical analysis techniques brought to bear on the study of cosmological fields has not kept pace with progress outside of astronomy . with modern tools such as the integrated nested laplace approximation ( inla ; @xcite ) , ` variational inference ' ( @xcite ) , particle filtering ( @xcite ) , and approximate bayesian computation ( abc ; @xcite ) almost entirely ignored to - date by the cosmological community we have , in my opinion , become the _ ` laggards ' _ of the technology adoption lifecycle .",
    "there are multiple factors seemingly to blame for this divergence : ( i ) the emergence of an isolationist attitude to the practice of cosmological statistics ; ( ii ) an over - emphasis on the path integration - based conceptulisation of random fields , rather than the measure - theory - based mathematics of mainstream statistics ; and ( iii ) an under - appreciation of the potential for stochastic process priors ( including , _ but not limited to _ , the gaussian process ) as flexible modelling components within the hierarchical bayesian framework . with the first",
    "already being well fought back against by inter - disciplinary programming in conferences such as the iaus306 and the scma series i will therefore focus in this proceedings ( as in my contributed talk ) on the latter two .",
    "in particular , i aim to clarify a number of mathematical concepts crucial to a high - level understanding of bayesian inference over random fields and measures ( section [ mathematics ] ) , and then to highlight just a few of the exciting techniques to have recently emerged in this area ( section [ techniques ] ) .",
    "cosmologists and astronomers already well - versed in the practice and theory of bayesian statistics in the finite - dimensional setting will typically have one of two contrasting experiences upon first attempting to extend these ideas to infinite - dimensional inference problems .",
    "the pragmatist will happily observe that the mechanics of computation are little changed ( e.g.  the gaussian random field at finite sample points is distributed just as the familiar multivariate gaussian ) , while the cautious theorist will more likely be overwhelmed by a first acquaintance with measure - theoretic probability ( i.e. , probability triples and the algebra of sets ) .",
    "but ideally one will have both experiences , since each offers an equally important perspective , as i discuss in this section .      in formal statistics",
    "the core of probabilistic computation is framed within the language of measure theory : the key object being the _ ` probability triple ' _ of ( i ) a sample space , @xmath0 , i.e. , some non - empty set ; ( ii ) a @xmath1-algebra , @xmath2 , i.e. , a collection of subsets of @xmath0 with @xmath3 , closed under the formation of complements , countable unions and intersections ; and ( iii ) a probability measure , @xmath4 , i.e. , a countably additive set function from @xmath2 to [ 0,1 ] for which @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in this context carathodory",
    "s extension theorem provides the theorist with the machinary to build complex probability triples and forge a rigorous notion of random variables as measures on the pre - images of borel @xmath1-algebra sets of the real numbers ; and from this to the familiar mechanics of probability densities defined with respect to the lebesgue measure ( e.g.  the standard normal with @xmath7 ) .",
    "nevertheless , with the lebesgue measure behaving intuitively as a product measure in @xmath8 , and with lebesgue and riemann integration interchangable in practice for all but a few rare cases , the pragmatist can safely ignore these theoretical foundations in the study of ` real - world ' problems in finite - dimensional settings .    in the context of probabilistic inference over _ fields",
    "_ , however , one must proceed with care as there exists no equivalent to the lebesgue measure to serve as a natural reference for defining densities in an infinite - dimensional banach space ( e.g.  the @xmath9 function spaces ) .",
    "hence , for bayesian analysis in infinite - dimensional space we must be deliberate in our choice of reference measure , which we encode into the prior .",
    "typically we will do this indirectly by assigning as prior the implicit measure ( or ` law ' ) belonging to a given _",
    "stochastic process _",
    "( e.g.  a gaussian process , or poisson process ) having sample paths within the field space under study .",
    "although quite technical the distinction between this formal statistical approach and the path integration - based language of cosmological papers , e.g.  @xcite , is important if we are to connect with , _ and thereby benefit from _ , the rich body of applied statistics literature on infinite - dimensional inference .",
    "worth noting also is that the measure - theoretic equivalent of the probability density is the ` radon - nikodym ( r - n ) derivative ' , with a trivial but illustrative example being that of the r - n derivative of posterior against prior given by the likelhood function divided by the marginal likelihood , c.f .  @xcite .",
    "finally , the measure theoretic definition of a stochastic process is a collection of random variables _ indexed _ by a set ; here all points of the physical metric space over which the field problem is to be studied .",
    "a key theoretical tool for the construction of stochastic processes , which is greatly illustrative of their behaviour , is kolmogorov s extension theorem .",
    "the theorem gives conditions under which a rule for assigning the distributions of the finite - dimensional projections of an infinite - dimensional indexing set can be considered sufficient to define a proper stochastic process .",
    "the key condition here is one of _ mutual consistency _ of ` coarser - binned ' finite - dimensional projected distributions with respect to ` finer - binned ' ones ; this idea was well - understood by the maxent pioneers , cf .",
    "@xcite : `` the prior must depend @xmath10 on the pixel size @xmath11 in such a way that subsidiary pixelisation is immaterial '' .",
    "as mentioned earlier for the pragmatist the mechanics of bayesian field analysis need differ little from those of finite - dimensional inference ; especially when we are able to write our prior ",
    "likelihood pairing via a stochastic process embedded within a _ hierarchical bayesian model_. a typical hierarchical model for bayesian field inference is the following from @xcite in the context of epidemiological geostatistics , @xmath12 we can read this model from the top down to understand the generative process for the data : binomial sampling from a population of @xmath13 at each site with underlying prevalence ( probability ) , @xmath14 , depending on the location of the site , @xmath15 .",
    "the prevalence field , @xmath14 , is in turn the realisation of a gaussian random field , gp , transformed to the range , ( 0,1 ) , by the _ link function _ , @xmath16 .",
    "a prior on the parameters of the mean and/or correlation function of the gp would be a natural extension of this particular model ; while natural extensions to other problems using the gp could include , e.g. , exponentation of @xmath17 via @xmath16 , use of a poisson process likelihood function , or some penalisation of the gp sample paths .",
    "an even greater diversity of hierarchical forms can then be built with the addition of _",
    "non_-gaussian processes : cf .",
    "systematic error analysis ( @xcite ) and _ non_-proportional hazards modelling ( @xcite ) with dirichlet processes , online bayesian classification with mondrian processes ( @xcite ) , and so on ( poisson processes , gamma processes , negative binomial processes , etc . ) .    for complicated real - world problems",
    "there is rarely an analytical solution to the resulting posterior so , as in ordinary bayesian analysis , one will almost always turn to computational methods .",
    "some of these are well - known to cosmologists already , such as gibbs sampling ( e.g.  @xcite ) and hamiltonian monte carlo ( e.g.  @xcite ) ; however , a much greater number of specialised techniques for bayesian field inference remain largely undiscovered .",
    "i highlight just a few of these briefly in the following section .",
    "from a geostatistical perspective it is difficult to overstate the revolutionary impact lately effected by the emergence of inla ( @xcite ) and the stochastic partial differential equation ( spde ) approach to gaussian processes ( @xcite ) . using the machinery of the finite - element method already familiar to astronomers",
    ", the spde approach aims to identify discretely - indexed gaussian _ markov _",
    "random fields providing weak approximations to their continuously - indexed counterparts .",
    "the result is a system for approximate bayesian inference over random fields amenable to _ fast _ computation via sparse matrix operations ; whereas hamiltonian mcmc over field posteriors is typically the reserve of cluster - computing , the inla method enables approximate field inference on desktop computers with run - times small enough to allow for the important follow - up inference steps of model testing and refinement .",
    "a first glimpse of the potential for inla in cosmological applications was provided in a 2010 study of cmb reconstruction by @xcite ; but as yet this pioneering work remains unappreciated ( or , at least , uncited ) .",
    "another seminal technique for ` big data ' bayesian inference over random fields is that of ` variational inference ' ( @xcite ) , in which approximation to the full field posterior is made using sets of data - driven ` inducing points ' .",
    "ongoing research efforts into the application of approximate bayesian computation ( @xcite ) and kalman filtering ( @xcite ) in the spatial domain are also well worth keeping an eye on ."
