    "the variational parameters @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 can be found from the bogoliubov inequality after minimizing the rhs of ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "thus our focus is on the cluster depicted in figure  [ tgl ] .",
    "each of the @xmath11-type spins belongs to two of such clusters simultaneously .",
    "hence only the half of each @xmath11-spin belongs to one cluster and therefore there are @xmath41 b - type spins in it . consequently the total number of ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) spins in the cluster will be @xmath44 ( there are @xmath45 @xmath10-type spins in the triangle ) . inequality ( [ 2 ] ) can be rewritten for the described cluster : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the real and @xmath48 the trial hamiltonian of the cluster , @xmath49 and @xmath50 free energies of the cluster defined by @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively .",

    "moreover , in general the presence of magnetic field ( @xmath90 ) suppresses the spin fluctuations and makes the self - consistent results more reliable and accurate @xcite .",
    "therefore , the equations ( 7 ) , ( 8) and ( 13)-(15 ) with magnetic field are quite sufficient for understanding some intrinsic relationships between magnetic and entanglement properties @xcite that naturally emerge in the ising - heisenberg model when one is complying with the variational mean - field like procedure .",
    "the results of the previous section can be used for investigation of the magnetic properties of the model . here",
    "we are interested in the sublattice @xmath10 properties , which , however , depend on parameters describing @xmath11-type spins .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a new ( ratio ) parameter @xmath91 .",
    "the magnetization curves can be found by solving numerically the transcendental equations ( [ 8a ] ) and ( [ 8b ] ) . the magnetic field dependence of the magnetization per atom is plotted in figure [ mag ] at @xmath92 .",
    "we find that in the absence of magnetic field , the ordered ferromagnetic phase with spontaneous magnetization per site @xmath93 is a stable ground state for all @xmath94 in spite of the high geometric frustration caused by the non - bipartite structure and antiferromagnetic intra - trimer interaction .",

    "a new partially saturated phase emerges in form of the ( spin ) plateaus shown in figure  [ mag](b ) , which can be associated with staggered magnetization or short range antiferromagnetism ( af ) in frustrated kagom geometry .",
    "indeed , the appearance of plateau in magnetization curve at @xmath95 can be explained as stability of trimeric @xmath10 sites in @xmath96 configuration .",
    "thus , at rather low temperatures , the magnetization shows the finite leap across a plateau at @xmath95 at infinitesimal magnetic field and below the critical field for full saturation by flipping a down spin .    in figure  [ mag_t ]",
    "we also show the temperature dependence of the magnetization in equilibrium . as one can see from figure  [ mag_t](a ) , in the absence of the external magnetic field the magnetization tends gradually to zero near the second - order transition temperature @xmath97 between ordered ( @xmath98 ) and disordered ( @xmath99 ) phases .",

    "we further discuss magnetic properties by comparison with thermal entanglement .",
    "the mean - field like treatment of ( [ 1 ] ) transforms many - body system to reduced `` single '' cluster study in a self - consistent field where quantum interactions exist .",

    "these phases exist only for the antiferromagnetic coupling , @xmath26 . for the ferromagnetic case ( @xmath150 ) in @xmath165 and @xmath166 regions we get spin saturation , with maximum @xmath107 ( @xmath167 ) and minimum @xmath168 ( @xmath169 ) magnetization per atom respectively .",
    "phase @xmath161 contains the two - fold degenerate states @xmath170 and @xmath171 , while phase @xmath162-the two - fold degenerate states @xmath172 and @xmath173 . by constructing the reduced density matrix in phases @xmath161 and @xmath162",

    "the area of non - zero entanglement coincides with the phase @xmath177 , where @xmath178 , while the one with zero entanglement ( @xmath149 ) corresponds to the phase @xmath179 with @xmath180 .",
    "notice , the plateau behavior in magnetization corresponds to constant entanglement values in corresponding density plots .",
    "the plateau in magnetization at @xmath178 corresponds to maximum entanglement value , @xmath174 , where the saturated phase at @xmath180 is disentangled , @xmath149 .",
    "this descriptive picture is also available at the non - zero temperature . at relatively low temperatures",
    "the plateau of magnetization at @xmath178 and entanglement coincide , except the narrow region in the vicinity of @xmath89 border . by decreasing the temperature the middle stripe in figure [ for_j](b ) narrows and",
    "gradually disappears ( see figure [ zero](b ) and also section  [ nonzero ] ) .",
    "this trend becomes apparent by comparison of figures [ for_j](b ) and [ plateau ] .",
    "the latter represents the density distribution of @xmath100 magnetization at considerably low temperature @xmath140 . in figure [ plateau ]",
    "the grey areas describe the plateau at @xmath178 , while black and white regions correspond to saturated states , @xmath180 .",
    "white regions in figure [ plateau ] correspond to the plateau behavior in the concurrence .",
    "as the temperature increases the borders between distinct ( different ) phases are gradually smeared out .",
    "summarizing , the structure of each of the heisenberg trimers has the crucial impact on the phase diagram in figure  12(a ) : the geometrical structure of a - sublattice is responsible for the frustration effects arising in the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model ( geometrical frustraion ) .",
    "this leads to above mentioned ground states with definite values of concurrence in figure 12(b ) .",
    "the ground state concurrence arises on magnetization plateaus at @xmath178 ( see figure 2(b ) for non - zero temperatures ) , which is a consequence of strong geometrical frustration of a - sublattice . while the octahedron environment ( b - sites ) are responsible for the effective field only .",

    "in this paper we find strong correlations between magnetic properties and quantum entanglement in spin-@xmath9 ising - heisenberg model on triangulated kagom lattice , which has been proposed to understand a frustrated magnetism of the series of @xmath181 polymeric coordination compounds .",
    "the ratio @xmath182 ( @xmath12 labels intra - trimer heisenberg , while @xmath13 monomer - trimer ising interactions ) is considered , which guaranties experimental realization for suitable theoretical treatment .",
    "we adopted variational mean - field like treatment ( based on gibbs - bogoliubov inequality ) of separate clusters in effective interconnected fields of two types ( consisting of heisenberg @xmath10 trimers and ising - type @xmath11 monomers ) .",
    "each of these fields taken separately describes not only corresponding ( a- or b- type ) spins , but the whole system .",
    "the calculated magnetic and thermodynamic properties of the model display the ( smooth ) second order phase transition from ordered into disordered phase driven by temperature and magnetic field .",
    "the thermal entanglement properties of @xmath10-trimers are the central in the aforementioned approximation .",
    "since there are some open questions in the definition of multipartite entanglement ( for example , see @xcite ) we used concurrence as a computable measure of bipartite entanglement for the trimeric units in terms of @xmath22 heisenberg model in self - consistent magnetic field applied to @xmath10 subsystem . due to the classical character of ising - type interactions the states of two neighboring heisenberg trimers are separable . using",
    "this fact we studied the entanglement of the each `` @xmath10 subdivisions '' of the cluster individually in effective ising - type field.our results show that entanglement does not vanish in zero external field as it happens for the mean field treatment of the isotropic @xmath22 heisenberg model on triangulated lattice .",
    "the geometrical structure of the lattice is responsible for the frustration effects arising in the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model ( geometrical frustration ) .",
    "it leads to existence of magnetization plateaus at @xmath178 and concurrence at @xmath174 . besides the effective field in mean - field solution also depends on the lattice structure ( via the number of @xmath11-sites in the cluster ) .",
    "in addition , the entangled - disentangled phases in concurrence and order - disordered phases in quantum phase transitions share many common features .",
    "the threshold temperature for concurrence is identical to critical temperature of second order phase transition . besides the entanglement and thermodynamic properties exhibit also common ( plateau and peak ) behavior in magnetization , susceptibility and concurrence .",
    "moreover , we found that for antiferromagnetic interaction the magnetic susceptibility peaks coincide with the corresponding phase boundaries at which the entanglement vanishes .",
    "however , this does not take place for the classical ferromagnetic interaction .",
    "this fact allows one to notice a quite visible correlation for the boundaries between various phases for entanglement , susceptibility and magnetization densities as a fingerprints of corresponding quantum phase transitions .",
    "thus , the density diagrams in the presence of magnetic field can be considered as a useful tools to detect important relationships between entanglement - disentanglement transitions in concurrence and corresponding order - disorder quantum phase transitions in quantum magnetism .",
