    "numerical solutions of our system of boltzmann transport equations ( see app .  [ sec : grb ] ) require knowledge about the rate of interactions and the average outcome of the bulk of all possible reactions . the interaction rate @xmath30 of the primary nucleus @xmath31 is used to compute the secondary injection and primary escape flux .",
    "the interaction rate depends on the interaction partner , the photon , as @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the photon density as a function of photon energy @xmath34 and the ( pitch ) angle between the photon and proton momenta @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the absorption cross section and @xmath37 is the photon energy in the parent rest frame ( prf ) or nucleus rest frame in the limit @xmath38 , and can be directly related to the available center - of - mass energy .",
    "the interaction itself , and therefore @xmath39 and @xmath34 , is typically defined in the shock rest frame ( srf ) .",
    "( [ equ : epsilon_r ] ) clearly shows that the relevant energy range in the prf is defined by the product of the target photon s energy times the nucleus energy in the srf and is therefore highly dependent on both , the choice of the target photon and the injection spectrum . in our models",
    "we assume isotropy @xmath40 of the target photon distribution .",
    "this means that , for grbs , we compute the interactions in the shock rest frame where isotropy occurs if the target photons come from self - consistent internal radiation processes ( such as synchrotron emission of electrons / positrons ) .",
    "isotropy smears out the substructure of the energy dependence of @xmath41 .    the injection @xmath42 of secondaries @xmath43 , which we need in eq .",
    "( [ equ : inject ] ) , is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ equ : agamma ] ) by replacing the total absorption cross section with the differential inclusive cross section @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the re - distribution function of the secondaries . for the energy spectrum of secondaries , we make use of typical kinematics , where for example , for grbs , the nuclei have pev energies and the photons are in kev range . in that case",
    "the momentum transfer on the ejected secondaries is small compared to @xmath39 , resulting in an approximate conservation of the relativistic boost . in that case",
    ", the re - distribution function can be approximated as a function of @xmath48 and @xmath49 as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the average number of secondaries produced per interaction ( also called `` multiplicity '' ) .",
    "it can be related to the exclusive reaction cross sections , summed over all channels in which the species @xmath52 is produced , as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the number of secondaries @xmath52 in that exclusive channel .",
    "note that the ratio between exclusive and total absorption cross section corresponds to the branching ratio .",
    "while for light fragments , @xmath55 can be larger than one , one expects for residual nuclei @xmath56 .    finally , note that fixed target experiments in photon beams typically measure the cross section in terms of prf energy , and it is a frequently asked question up to which energy the cross section needs to be measured . in astrophysical environments ,",
    "a certain prf energy can be related to the primary @xmath39 and photon @xmath34 energies by the estimate @xmath57 , neglecting the pitch angle averaging , see eq .",
    "( [ equ : epsilon_r ] ) .",
    "astrophysical photon spectra typically exhibit features , such as a spectral break ( such as for grbs ) or a maximum ( such as for the cmb ) at a certain @xmath58 , whereas the cosmic - ray primaries typically follow a power law . as a consequence , given a cross section @xmath59 at a certain energy @xmath48 , primaries with the energy @xmath60 will be selected to interact , and the secondary spectra will exhibit spectral excesses corresponding to that primary energy . in that sense , @xmath59 as a function of the prf is the required input for astrophysical applications , and a definition of a target photon spectrum in the nucleus rest frame does not make sense .",
    "larger values of @xmath48 just mean that the spectral features will appear at higher energies in @xmath39 if the cross section is significantly large there .",
    "for all practical cases , one therefore needs the cross section in the region around the gdr up to the point where it significantly drops .",
    "this can be seen _",
    "e.g. _  in fig .",
    "[ fig : dis23 ] by comparing the peanut cross section curve with the measurement for @xmath61na , which are practically identical up to the maximally measured energy .",
    "the difference in the disintegration length is nevertheless large , as the contribution beyond @xmath62 30  mev , which is missing in the measurement case , can not be neglected ( and will be re - distributed by the pitch angle averaging ) .",
    "the direct correlation @xmath63 , translating cross section peaks into the disintegration rate , can be best seen in the cmb cases in fig .",
    "[ fig : dis23 ] .",
    "here we summarize the status on experimental data and theoretical models .",
    "exfor @xcite is a nuclear reaction database , aimed to be a complete collection of experiments and theoretical evaluations performed during the last half century .",
    "the effort to maintain and standardize the data collection is a world - wide collaborative effort between various nuclear centers . in this work",
    ", we assume that this database is to a large extent complete and our result is not distorted by one or few missing entries .",
    "the database contains experimental data points , model - evaluated data , ratios of cross sections and other data categories . for our purpose",
    "we apply the following criteria to the data selection :    * only real experimental data , no evaluated cross sections ; * no reaction combinations , ratios or partial measurements ; * full unfolded cross sections in barns ; * energy range of the measurement has to cover the gdr peak .",
    "further , we create two selections ( exfor , @xmath5 ) and ( exfor , any ) , where the first includes only measured absorption cross sections @xmath5 and the latter requires at least one inclusive cross section to be measured . with these criteria , exfor contains 14 absolute cross sections and 47 of the second category up to masses of @xmath19fe .",
    "( exfor , any ) can be used to estimate the number of more certain absorption cross sections from nuclear reaction models .",
    "monte carlo particle transport codes , such as fluka  @xcite , mcnp @xcite or phits @xcite use evaluated nuclear data files to compute interaction rates and icpe for exclusive reaction cross / sections .",
    "fluka contains a comprehensive photo - nuclear cross section library based direct on data , photo - neutron evaluation and parameterizations for a large set of isotopes @xcite .",
    "it is coupled to the icpe code peanut to generate final state distributions .",
    "comparisons of peanut cross sections reveal a very good agreement to available data on @xmath41 .",
    "mcnp employs in a similar manner endf - b - vii.1 @xcite as evaluated nuclear data library , based on reaction model calculations using the gnash code system . for photo - nuclear data",
    "file for phits is jendl / pd-2004 @xcite , which has often good agreement with data but also shows some interpolation or fitting artifacts for light and intermediate nuclei .",
    "our current baseline model is based on cross sections extracted from talys 1.8 for nuclei with @xmath64 and crpropa2 lighter nuclei .",
    "talys 1.8 was configured to use the kopecki - uhl generalized lorentzian description , as it is recommended in @xcite in order to better predict cross sections non only in the gdr region .",
    "photo - nuclear cross sections for light nuclei in crpropa 2 are compiled from various references , as reported in @xcite , for a total of 19 primary isotopes and 69 inclusive cross sections .",
    "the talys 1.6 cross sections are currently used in crpropa 3 , to predict photodisintegration products of all available exclusive channels : proton , neutron , deuterium , tritium , helium-3 and helium-4 and combinations thereof ; the parameters used to model the giant dipole resonance have been adjusted to match the cross sections reported in @xcite , as explained in @xcite .",
    "the _ simprop _ code uses an approximation scheme to implement talys cross sections , as reported in @xcite .",
    "the psb model @xcite , which is tailored for cosmic - ray propagation problems , represents each isobar with the most abundant stable isotope , starting from @xmath65fe down to @xmath66h , excluding the unstable masses @xmath67 .",
    "this model approximates the cross sections for one- and two - nucleon emission with a gaussian shape in the low energy range ( 2 @xmath68 30 mev ) , while the cross sections for multi - nucleon emission in the high energy range ( 30 @xmath68 150 mev ) are constant . in _",
    "simprop _ the list of isobars matches @xcite , but the corresponding elements are assigned from table 1 in @xcite by choosing the isotope that corresponds to the lowest energy threshold for the emission of one proton . for the purpose of the present work ,",
    "we have slightly changed the criterion for choosing the element with respect to what has been done in _",
    "simprop _ or in the original psb model , that allowed for example for @xmath69 with an increasing number of protons with respect to the parent nucleus , by choosing descending elements in the chain corresponding to the mass in the original list .",
    "our grb model follows refs .",
    "@xcite , extended by the explicit simulation of the nuclear cascade . here",
    "we only sketch the key ingredients , whereas details of the computation method and the efficient treatment of the particle interactions will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "we solve a system of partial differential equations , which , for particle species @xmath52 ( in our case nuclei ) , reads @xmath70 where @xmath71 with the energy loss rate @xmath72 and @xmath73 the escape rate .",
    "the equation is solved for the differential particle densities @xmath54 as a function of time , evolved until the steady state is reached .",
    "the coupled system arises because the injection term @xmath74 allows for injection from an acceleration zone @xmath75 , as well as for injection from other species @xmath31 with the term @xmath43 , such as from photodisintegration . in this work ,",
    "we only inject @xmath19fe into the system with a power law @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is determined by balancing the dominant energy loss process with the acceleration rate @xmath78 . here",
    "@xmath79 is the larmor radius and a relatively high @xmath80 has been chosen to reproduce the composition transition observed by auger  @xcite .. ] the target photons are assumed to follow a broken power law with a break at 1  kev in the shock rest frame between the power law index @xmath81 ( low energy ) and @xmath82 ( high energy ) .",
    "note that we choose the minimal photon energy low enough such that photodisintegration will always dominate at the highest energies .",
    "the baryonic loading is assumed to be ten , which means that there is ten times more energy injected into iron compared to electrons , and energy equipartition between magnetic field , electron and photon energy is assumed .    for the nuclear energy losses , we include synchrotron losses , adiabatic losses , pair production losses , and photonuclear losses , where we distinguish between photodisintegration ( focus of this work , dominated by the gdr ) and photo - meson production ( dominated by the @xmath83-resonance and other processes ) by @xmath48 .",
    "the photodisintegration is implemented in different models , as discussed in the main text of this work .",
    "we include photo - meson production based on sophia  @xcite using an improved and extended version of ref .",
    "@xcite with a superposition interaction model assuming that the cross section scales @xmath84 .",
    "while such an approach is state - of - the - art in the literature , see _ e.g. _  refs .",
    "@xcite , it is clear that it needs improvement from the interaction model perspective . note that photo - meson production leads to the disintegration of nuclei as well , where the characteristics ( secondary nuclei multiplicities and distributions ) can be different ; however , for the chosen parameters , the photodisintegration dominates .",
    "we furthermore include beta decays of radioactive isotopes and spontaneous emission channels which are relevant on the dynamical timescale  @xcite .    in order to discuss the ejected cosmic - ray composition",
    ", we assume that cosmic rays can either escape as neutrons ( which are not magnetically confined ) or , directly from the borders of the production region within their interaction length or larmor radius ( whatever is smaller )  @xcite , which leads to relatively hard spectra acting as a high - pass filter  @xcite .",
    "this is , in a way , the most conservative assumption one can make , as , for instance , diffusion would enhance the escape at lower energies , or the magnetic fields may decay quickly enough that all particles can escape .",
    "more detailed discussions of the astrophysical implications including the neutrino production will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .    for an efficient computation ,",
    "we need to pre - select the isotopes which are dominantly populated .",
    "our isotope selection scheme is a fully automated recursive algorithm starting ( in this case ) with @xmath19fe , following all disintegration and beta decay paths recursively .",
    "we also allow for mixed paths , meaning , for instance , that a disintegration may be followed by beta decay and then disintegration again .",
    "since one isotope has typically very many ( disintegration ) branchings into daughters , some of these being very small , we impose a cutoff on the secondary multiplicity ( number of secondaries produced on average ) at a value of 0.01 . as a further complication , the multiplicities , _",
    "i.e. _ , the distribution of secondaries , depend on @xmath48 . in order to be as inclusive as possible",
    ", we therefore repeat the procedure for several values of @xmath48 in the relevant interaction energy range .",
    ", see eq .",
    "( [ equ : epsilon_r ] ) .",
    "] we also tested other methods ( such as based on the fractional contribution or picking the leading channels ) with similar results .",
    "however , the result will depend on the choice of the control parameter , which is the threshold multiplicity here .",
    "as it turns out that intermediate mass number isotopes have a large number of daughter nuclei with relatively small multiplicities off the main diagonal , one can not pick a too large threshold value as it would stop the cascade .",
    "fast spontaneous emitters ( faster than any other process at any given energy ) are automatically integrated out by recursively following their decay paths to the next isotope which is explicitly treated .",
    "for example , for the talys disintegration model , the software uses 481 isotopes , about 41000 inclusive disintegration channels and about 3000 photo - meson channels as primary input , selects 233 isotopes , and attaches 4943 disintegration , 10 beta decay ( relevant on the grb timescale ) and 1344 photo - meson channels to them . with this level of complexity and the explicit treatment of the nuclear cascade ,",
    "it is clear that our technology is currently more advanced that any other method in the literature for the simulation of the sources of the uhecr nuclei themselves .    the choice of isotopes in fig .",
    "[ fig : exfor_chart ] labeled `` astro , priority 1 '' and `` astro , priority 2 '' has been obtained with a similar method by repeating the above recursive procedure for a number of possible injection elements : we inject for each atomic number the most abundant stable isotope .",
    "the multiplicity threshold has been chosen to be 0.2 for priority  1 and 0.05 for priority  2 .",
    "as these numbers are larger than the threshold above , this list of isotopes is smaller than the one actually used for the grb computation .",
    "however , one can easily see by comparing the blue isotopes in fig .",
    "[ fig : exfor_chart ] with the ones in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuclei ] , upper right panel , that these are actually the most populated ones in a realistic simulation .",
    "note that the main difference between these plots is that the extension of the nuclear cascade to low mass numbers depends on the energy in the grb , and that only iron has been injected in the grb case .",
    "we expect that our isotope priority selection is robust in the sense that taking into account different @xmath48 and being inclusive in the selected isotopes , they hardly depend on the shape of the target photon spectrum .",
    "we also show two models used in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuclei2 ] : the `` systematic offset '' and `` random systematics '' ( one example ) cases .",
    "the uncertainties in the cross sections are inspired by fig .",
    "[ fig : dis40 ] , which are of the the order of a factor two . for the random offsets panel ,",
    "we vary all unmeasured absorption cross sections randomly between @xmath85 and @xmath86 of their nominal values , and all absorption cross sections with only some partial information ( inclusive channels ) between @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "note that we re - scale all absorption and inclusive cross sections for one isotope with the same number , as we obtain otherwise inconsistencies between the escape and re - injection rates .",
    "we can read off from the figure that certain isotopes will be more highlighted then others , while the total cascade looks similar to the nominal talys model .",
    "for the `` systematic offset '' panel , we systematically choose the minimal value in these cases , which leads to a systematic suppression of the nuclear cascade . here",
    "the nuclear cascade will stop because of the cross section suppression , and intermediate and light elements will not be populated .",
    "to illustrate a second example in addition to fig .",
    "[ fig : dis40 ] , we compare cross sections of @xmath89na and @xmath89 mg in fig .",
    "[ fig : dis23 ] .",
    "contrary to the double - magic @xmath12ca , @xmath89na is not expected to be spherical , where gdr cross sections can be sufficiently approximated using a single peak .",
    "therefore , the models with only one main lorentzian or gaussian peak do not reproduce the measurement , as it is the case for the psb model . without dedicated lorentzian fits",
    ", talys does nt reproduce the shape of the gdr peak , adding an additional , unphysical , peak at @xmath90 mev .",
    "the latter can be attributed to the strength parameter setting and can be potentially corrected through individual tuning . however",
    ", such modification would alter the model for a single isotope without improving the predictive power for other isobars .",
    "the peanut prediction reproduces very well the available measurement  @xcite on @xmath89na , while the box model is insufficient and yields factor of two smaller disintegration rates . for the unknown @xmath89 mg cross section , talys , psb and the box model",
    "predict identical cross sections , while peanut falls back to a parametrized form , producing a significantly different result .",
    "updated versions of peanut and fluka estimate unknown cross sections with the isobaric analog state ( ias ) approach , where nuclei with identical wave functions , and therefore , with a similar isospin and level structure are treated analogously .",
    "if such an equivalence case is detected , the model maps unknown cross sections of nuclei to a known ias nucleus .",
    "the effect of ias is illustrated in the right panel fig .",
    "[ fig : dis23 ] and results in up to a factor three higher disintegration rates in the case of peanut .",
    "if ias is a valid concept for photon projectiles , several additional cross sections can become known to higher precision without the need for individual measurements ."

    "<S> the shaded region shows the model spread for an ensemble of 100 variations of the talys model with random cross section offsets ( per isotope ) within the anticipated uncertainty , and the `` systematics offset '' curve refers to a systematic suppression of all unmeasured cross sections , see app .  </S>",

    "<S> first of all , it is noteworthy that the observed uhecr composition  @xcite can be roughly reproduced from a single grb shell and iron injection only , and will be even smoother after propagation . </S>",
    "<S> more sophisticated interaction models ( talys , peanut ) produce similar results , and even random cross section offsets within the model uncertainties do not qualitatively affect this picture , as the random variations seem to average out over the large number of involved isotopes ( see shaded region for 100 ensemble models ) </S>",
    "<S> . however , the lack of / feeddown into light and intermediate elements produced in the psb and `` systematic offset '' ( systematic suppression of all unmeasured cross sections ) models leads to strong deviations at about @xmath25 from the baseline models . from this example </S>",
    "<S> , we conclude that the interaction model needs to be more sophisticated than the psb model with a prediction power good enough to avoid systematic offsets . </S>",
    "<S> note that such systematic offsets can also occur if a subset of isotope cross sections in the model is adjusted to measurements , while leaving the bulk of other unmeasured isotopes unmodified . since neutrons can easier escape from the astrophysical source than protons , the cosmic ray composition is sensitive to an artificial imbalance between proton- and neutron - rich elements in the cascade .    </S>",
    "<S> we derive a complete list of isotopes for which the absorption and inclusive cross sections are needed to cover any cosmic - ray astrophysics scenario involving injection elements with masses up to iron , that we separate in `` astro , priority 1 '' and `` astro , priority 2 '' in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> this information could come from predictive models , or from measurements directly . </S>",
    "<S> the certainty in predictive power for cross sections may be improved by systematic measurements using isotope groups along the main diagonal and perpendicular to it ( isobars ) , such as @xmath18ar in addition to @xmath18ca ( other stable isobar pairs are @xmath26s/@xmath26ar , @xmath27ca/@xmath27ti , @xmath28ti/@xmath28cr , and @xmath29cr/@xmath29fe ) .    </S>",
    "<S> * summary and conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> * we have compared the situation of nuclear measurements ( red / yellow in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : exfor_chart ] ) with the input needed for cosmic - ray astrophysics ( blue in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : exfor_chart ] ) , where we have included astrophysical sources as a key aspect in addition to conventional studies on cosmic - ray propagation . </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated that the measurements on the participating nuclear isotopes are sparse , as unstable nuclei are produced in the photodisintegration which can live relatively long at extremely high energies where their lifetimes are lorentz - boosted .    </S>",
    "<S> while sophisticated nuclear models exist , such as talys , their prediction power for low mass ( lower than iron ) isotopes seems limited to within about a factor of two . </S>",
    "<S> while the impact on individual photodisintegration rates can be large , we have found that random fluctuations do not affect the nuclear cascade unless there are systematic effects not probably accounted for , such as offsets between neutron- and proton - rich elements , along the main diagonal , or a missed feeddown into lighter isotopes . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore propose systematic measurements to improve the predictability of unmeasured cross sections , such as by measuring the total absorption cross section for two or more different isobars  for which we did not find a single existing example . </S>",
    "<S> a long term goal could be measurements of total and inclusive cross sections of the blue - marked isotopes in fig .  </S>",
