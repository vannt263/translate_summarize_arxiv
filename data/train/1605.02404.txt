    "the discovery of superconductivity in iron pnictides was soon followed by its discovery in iron _ chalcogenide _ fese .",
    "a lot of attention was attracted to this system because of its simplicity , though its superconducting characteristics ( under normal conditions ) were quite modest ( @xmath88k ) and its electronic structure was quite similar to that of iron pnictides ( cf . review in @xcite ) .    the situation with iron chalcogenides fundamentally changed with the appearance of _ intercalated _ fese based systems with the value of @xmath830 - 40k , which immediately attracted attention due to their unusual electronic structure @xcite .",
    "currently quite the number of such compounds is known .",
    "the first systems of this kind were a@xmath0fe@xmath9se@xmath1 ( a = k , rb , cs ) with the value of @xmath8 30k @xcite .",
    "it is generally believed that superconductivity in this system appears in an ideal 122-type structure .",
    "however samples studied so far always have been multiphase , consisting of a mixture of mesoscopic superconducting and insulating ( antiferromagnetic ) structures such as k@xmath1fe@xmath10se@xmath11 , which complicates the studies of this system .",
    "a substantial further increase of @xmath7 up to 45k has been achieved by intercalation of fese layers with rather large molecules in compounds such as li@xmath0(c@xmath1h@xmath12n@xmath1)fe@xmath9se@xmath1 @xcite and li@xmath0(nh@xmath1)@xmath13(nh@xmath4)@xmath14fe@xmath1se@xmath1 @xcite .",

    "these films were grown as described in ref .",
    "@xcite and most of the works to follow on the 001 plane of the sto .",
    "the tunnel experiments reported in ref . @xcite produced the record values of the energy gap , while the resistivity measurements gave the temperature of the beginning of superconducting transition substantially higher than 50k .",
    "it should be noted that the films under study are very unstable on the air .",

    "so far , these results have not been confirmed by the other authors .",
    "however arpes measurements of the temperature dependence of the superconducting gap in such films , now confidently demonstrate value of @xmath7 in the range of 6575 k.    films consisting of several fese layers produce the values of @xmath7 significantly lower than those for the single  layer films @xcite .",
    "recently monolayer fese film on 110 sto plane @xcite covered with several fete layers was grown .",
    "resistivity measurements on these films ( including measurements of the upper critical magnetic field @xmath17 ) gave value of @xmath830k .",
    "at the same time , the fese film , grown on batio@xmath4 ( bto ) substrate , doped with nb ( with even larger than in sto values of the lattice constant @xmath15 3.99  ) , showed in the arpes measurements the value of @xmath18 70k @xcite . in a recent paper @xcite it was reported the observation of quite high values of the superconducting gap in fese ( from tunnelling spectroscopy ) for fese monolayers grown on 001 plane of tio@xmath19 ( anatase ) , which in its turn was grown on the 001 plane of srtio@xmath4 .",
    "the lattice constant of anatase is very close to the lattice constant of bulk fese , so fese film remains essentially unstretched .",
    "single  layer fese films were also grown on the graphene substrate , but the value of @xmath7 was of the order of 8 - 10k similar to bulk fese @xcite . that emphasizes the role of the unique properties of substrates such as sr(ba)tio@xmath4 , which can play determining role in the significant increase of @xmath7 .    more information about the experiments on single ",

    "we can conclude , that the presence of sto interface leads to the appearance of this additional band of o-2p surface states near the fermi level with probable `` nesting '' with hole fe 3d  band band with nesting vector @xmath60=0 .",
    "also we observe rather small splitting of electron bands at @xmath6  point .",
    "the relevance of these results to arpes experiments and their significance for enhanced superconductivity in fese / sto system are at present unclear .",
    "however , the additional electron band splitting may have the relation to the observation of the `` replica '' band at @xmath6 ",
    "point @xcite , providing the explanation of its appearance not related to interaction with optical phonons in sto .",
    "we have presented a short review of calculations of electronic band structure of high  @xmath7 systems based on fese monolayers , from intercalated compounds like a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath38s@xmath46 ( a = k , cs , ... ) and [ li@xmath3fe@xmath0oh]fese to single fese layer films of srtio@xmath4 substrate .",
    "our calculations show , that in all these systems the general structure of electronic spectrum is significantly different from the `` standard model '' typical for almost all feas based superconductors and bulk fese .",
    "this structure is characterized by the practical absence of hole  like fermi surface cylinders around the @xmath5  point at the center of the brillouin zone with only electron  like cylinders present around the @xmath6  points in the corners of the brillouin zone .",
    "these results are essentially confirmed by the available arpes experiments .",
    "an apparent absence of obvious `` nesting '' properties between electron and hole fermi surface pockets cast serious doubts upon the most popular picture of cooper pairing , assumed to realize in feas systems , based on the exchange of antiferromagnetic fluctuations and leading to the picture of @xmath61 pairing @xcite .",
    "the role of electronic correlations in fese monolayers remain rather controversial .",
    "lda+dmft calculations for k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath1s system show that here these correlations are more important than in typical feas systems , leading to stronger bandwidth compression ( different for different fe 3d  bands ) and rather poorly defined quasiparticles close to the fermi level . in contrast to this , in isolated fese single ",
    "layer system the same calculations demonstrate rather weak influence of correlations with small bandwidth compression ( effective mass renormalization ) . the role of srtio@xmath4 substrate may also be important leading to the appearance of o-2p hole band of tio@xmath1 layer in the vicinity of the fermi level .",
    "the serious problems for understanding of the observable electronic structure of fese monolayer systems remain to be solved .",
    "in particular , at present there are no acceptable explanation of formation of unusually `` shallow '' electronic bands around the @xmath62  points , with fermi energies @xmath15 0.05 ev , observed in arpes experiments on all of these systems .",
    "it can be guessed that this fact reflects our poor understanding of electron correlations and the question remains open .",
    "note that the existence of such small fermi energies in conduction bands of the system under discussion signifies the serious problems related to the antiadiabatic regime of cooper pairing @xcite .",
    "taking into account the typical values of the energy gap in fese monolayer superconductors @xmath63 0.015 - 0.02 ev @xcite we also obtain the anomalously low gap to the fermi energy ratios : @xmath640.25 - 0.5 , which indicate , that these superconductors belong to bcs ",
