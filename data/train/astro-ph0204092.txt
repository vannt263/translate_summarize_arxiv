    "the non - gaussian features of the qso s ly@xmath0 transmitted flux were recently studied and showed that the cosmic mass field traced by the qso s ly@xmath0 forests is intermittent on small scales .",
    "that is , the probability distribution functions ( pdf ) of the transmitted flux fluctuations were found to be substantially long tailed on scales less than @xmath5 1 h@xmath4 mpc .",
    "the spatial distribution of the power of the transmission fluctuations was found to be spiky , i.e. , the power was concentrated in rare modes while most modes showed very low power ( jamkhedkar , zhan and fang 2000 ; zhan , jamkhedkar and fang 2001 ; feng , pando and fang 2001 ) .",
    "the impact of intermittency on observational cosmology is that the power spectrum is no longer effective for testing models when intermittency is substantial .",
    "although spikes in the intermittent field are rare and improbable events , one can not neglect the spikes in measuring the power spectrum as almost all power of the transmission fluctuations is concentrated in these events . in such a case , the power spectrum is dominated by rare and improbable events ( spikes ) .",
    "an intermittent field is statistically homogeneous .",
    "yet , the rare events lead to significant differences among samples from different parts of the universe when the spatial size of the region is not large enough to contain numerous spikes .",
    "the precision of determining the power spectra is intrinsically constrained by intermittency .",
    "the uncertainty of the power spectrum for an intermittent field is inevitably large ( jamkhedkar et al 2002 , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "therefore , in the nonlinear regime , more effective measures to compare the predictions of models and observations must be used .",
    "although an intermittent field is non - gaussian , many non - gaussian statistics are ineffective or insensitive to intermittency .",
    "this is because we need not only techniques for confirming the non - gaussianity of a field , but also methods which can tell the _ type _ of non - gaussianity .",
    "the most effective measures sensitive to the _ type _ of intermittency are the structure functions and the intermittent exponent ( e.g. shraiman & siggia 2000 ) .    in this paper",
    ", using a set of 28 high resolution , high signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) qso ly@xmath0 absorption spectra ( keck data ) , we will carry out a systematic investigation of the structure functions and the intermittent exponent of the transmitted flux . to show the usefulness of the structure function and intermittent exponent as model discriminators",
    ", we also study the intermittent behaviors of ly@xmath0 forest samples produced by a pseudo - hydro simulation technique for the lcdm and wdm models .",
    "these models are among the best that match the observed power spectrum and other lower than second order statistics .",
    "we will show that the simulation samples are significantly intermittent .",
    "however , both the quantitative and qualitative properties of simulation samples are found to be substantially different from the keck data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    " 2 addresses the method for measuring intermittent random fields .  3",
    "presents the algorithm for calculating the structure functions and intermittent exponent .",
    " 4 describes , both the observed and simulated samples , that we will use .",
    "the power spectrum and other lower order statistics of the keck data and simulation samples are given in  5 .",
    " 6 contains the important result , the structure function , intermittent exponent and their of order- , redshift- and scale - dependencies for the keck data and simulation samples .",
    "the emphasis is on revealing the deviation of the intermittent behavior for the simulation samples from the keck data",
    ". finally , the conclusions and discussions are in  7 .",
    "physically , intermittency is used to characterize a special type of random field in which structures are essentially strong enhancements , peaks or spikes , randomly and widely scattered in space and/or time , with a low field value between the spikes .",
    "the spike - gap - spike feature is more pronounced on smaller scales .",
    "that is , compared with gaussian fields , the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the fluctuations possesses a high peak around zero and possibly a long - tail .",
    "the long - tail events correspond to the rare and improbable high peaks .",
    "this feature was originally found in the temperature and velocity distributions in turbulence ( batchelor & townsend 1949 ) .",
    "mathematically , an intermittent random density field @xmath6 is defined by the ratio between the high- and low - order moments of the field @xmath7^{2n}\\rangle } { [ \\langle [ \\rho(x+r)- \\rho(x)]^2\\rangle]^n } \\asymp\\left \\langle \\frac{r}{l } \\right \\rangle^{\\zeta(n)},\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the size of the sample , and the exponent @xmath9 can be function of @xmath10 and @xmath11 . if @xmath9 is negative for small @xmath11 , the ratio eq.(1 ) is divergent with @xmath12 .",
    "this corresponds to an intermittent field .",
    "an intermittent field is characterized by the @xmath10- and @xmath11-dependencies of exponent @xmath9 .",
    "these properties make characterizing intermittent fields by traditional statistical measures difficult .",
    "the power spectrum and two - point correlation function are unable to quantify intermittency .",
    "two fields having the same power spectrum may have very different tails in their pdf .",
    "very different from the linear regime , the power spectrum will on longer be a critical discriminator among models of structure formation for an intermittent field .",
    "equally ineffective are any individual higher order correlation functions and higher order moments of the density fluctuations @xmath13/\\bar{\\rho}$ ] . three- and four - point correlation functions of the density perturbation @xmath14 are very useful for distinguishing a gaussian from a non - gaussian field .",
    "however , they are insensitive to the difference between an intermittent field and a non - gaussian , but non - intermittent field .",
    "moreover , eq.(1 ) means that the pdf of the density fluctuations @xmath15 $ ] can not be expanded into a series of moments of @xmath15 $ ] , as it does not converge . in this case , a better measure is not the divergent quantity itself , @xmath16^{2n}\\rangle/ \\langle [ \\rho(x+r)- \\rho(x)]^2\\rangle ^n$ ] when @xmath12 , but the quantity describing the divergent behavior , specifically , the exponent @xmath9 .",
    "let us define density difference @xmath17 .",
    "the density difference is equal to the density contrast difference , @xmath18 , if the mean density @xmath19 is normalized to 1 .",
    "intermittency is now defined by the divergence of the ratio between the high and low order moments @xmath20 . for a gaussian field ,",
    "the statistical properties of a field @xmath6 and its difference @xmath21 are the same , while they are different for an intermittent field .",
    "the ensemble average of the moment @xmath22 is @xmath23 where @xmath10 is a positive integer . if the field is homogeneous , @xmath24 is independent of @xmath25 and depends only on @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath24 is called the structure function . when the  fair sample hypothesis \" is applicable ( peebles 1980 ) , the structure function can be calculated as the spatial average @xmath26 where @xmath8 is the spatial range of the sample .",
    "when @xmath27 , we have @xmath28 @xmath29 is the mean of the square of the density fluctuations at wavenumber @xmath30 , and therefore , the @xmath11-dependence of @xmath29 actually is a different version of the ordinary power spectrum of the field .",

    "the condition @xmath33^n$ ] on small scales @xmath34 indicates that the field contains `` abnormal '' events of large density fluctuations @xmath35 on scale @xmath11 .",
    "thus , the more negative the exponent @xmath9 on smaller scales , the stronger the `` abnormal '' events on smaller scales .",
    "this gives rise to the spiky structure of an intermittent field .",
    "generally speaking , the intermittent exponent @xmath9 measures the smoothness of the field : for positive @xmath9 , the field is smoother on smaller scales .",

    "\\left [ s^2_r\\right ] ^n,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the gaussian pdf of @xmath38 .",

    "it has been shown that a hierarchical clustered field is ( feng , pando & fang 2001 ) @xmath31^n } \\propto \\left(\\frac{r}{l }     \\right ) ^{-(d-\\kappa)(n-1)},\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the spatial dimension , and the coefficient @xmath51 is a constant depending on the power law index of the power spectrum . in the case",
    "where @xmath52 , the field is intermittent with exponent @xmath53 this is the simplest type of intermittency  a mono - fractal with fractal dimension @xmath51 in @xmath50-dimensional space . a phenomenological model with hierarchical relations",
    "was developed by soneira & peebles ( 1977 ) .",
    "the model is essentially the same as the so - called @xmath54-model of the intermittency in turbulence where a dimension @xmath51 fractal distribution in @xmath50-dimensional space has the exponent @xmath9 is given by eq.(12 ) ( frisch 1995 . )    \\4 . a lognormal field    since the time of hubble , the lognormal distribution has been used to model the pdfs of the cosmic mass and velocity field , such as the one - point distribution of the number of galaxies , velocity difference , angular momentum , etc ( e.g. yang et al .",
    "2001b ) . the lognormal model of the baryonic matter distribution ( bi & davidsen , 1997 ; feng & fang 2000 ) has also been found to be in good agreement with all observed properties of the ly@xmath0 forests .",
    "for a lognormal field , the pdf of @xmath38 is given by @xmath55 = \\frac{1}{2^{3/2}\\pi^{1/2}|\\delta_r(x)|\\sigma(r ) }   \\exp\\left \\",

    "therefore , a lognormal field is intermittent .    to summarize , the structure function and intermittent exponent provide a complete and unified description of intermittent fields .",
    "the @xmath10- and @xmath11-dependencies of the structure functions and intermittent exponent @xmath9 are sensitive to the details of the intermittency of the field .",
    "these measures are very powerful for distinguishing among fields that are gaussian , self - similar , mono - fractal , multi - fractal , and singular .",
    "the quantity @xmath38 or @xmath60 $ ] contains two variables : the position @xmath25 and the scale @xmath11 , and therefore , @xmath61 should be calculated with a space - scale decomposition .",
    "moreover , as defined by eq.(2 ) , @xmath62 is sometimes a diverging quantity .",
    "for instance , @xmath63 $ ] is divergent if the 2-point correlation function @xmath64 .",
    "this problem can be handled in the same way as n - point correlation functions are handled , i.e. , smoothing the density field at small scale prior to its measurement .",
    "however , the size of the smoothing scale is put in by hand and might induce uncertainties , especially in studying the scaling behavior on scale comparable with the smoothing size .    ideally one would like a space - scale decomposition without the need for pre  smoothing by hand .",
    "this leads us to chose the discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ) .",
    "the dwt performs a smoothing  automatically \" as the density difference @xmath65 $ ] on scale @xmath11 is calculated by a difference between the smoothed densities at spatial ranges @xmath66 and @xmath67 . in wavelet analysis ,",
    "the smoothing is done scale - by - scale . moreover , the bases that the dwt uses for smoothing and decomposing distributions are orthogonal and complete .",
    "the smoothing and decomposition are optimized and there is no loss of information .",
    "furthermore , no mixing of the density fluctuations among different scales occurs .",
    "this property is excellent for studying scaling .",
    "here we only very briefly introduce the dwt decomposition , as it has been introduced in our previous publications ( e.g. pando & fang 1996 ; pando & fang 1998 ; fang & feng 2000 ) . for details on the dwt refer to mallat ( 1989a , b ) ; meyer ( 1992 ) ; daubechies , ( 1992 ) , and for physical applications , refer to fang & thews ( 1998 ) .",
    "we restrict our discussion to a 1-d random field of the transmission flux @xmath68 extending in a spatial or redshift range @xmath69 .",
    "to apply the dwt , we first chop the spatial range @xmath69 of the 1-d sample into @xmath70 subintervals labeled with @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a positive integer .",
    "each subinterval spans a spatial range @xmath73 .",
    "the subinterval @xmath74 is from @xmath75 to @xmath76 .",
    "that is , we decompose the space @xmath8 into cells @xmath77 , where @xmath72 denotes the scale @xmath73 , and @xmath74 the spatial range @xmath78 .",
    "cell @xmath77 is localized in scale space and physical ( or redshift ) space .",
    "corresponding to each cell , there is a scaling function @xmath79 , and a wavelet function @xmath80 .",
    "these functions are the basis for the scale - space decomposition .",
    "the most important property of the dwt basis is its locality in both scale and physical spaces .",
    "the scaling function @xmath79 is a window function on scale @xmath72 and at position @xmath74 .",
    "the wavelet function @xmath81 is admissible ( daubechies 1992 ) , i.e. , @xmath82 , and therefore , it measures the fluctuation on scale @xmath72 and at position @xmath74 .    with the dwt , a transmission @xmath68 can be decomposed as ( fang & thews 1998 ) .",
    "@xmath83 where @xmath84 is given by the finest scale ( resolution ) of the sample , i.e. , @xmath85 , and @xmath72 is the scale of interest . the scaling function coefficient ( sfc ) @xmath86 in eq.(16 )",
    "is given by projecting @xmath68 onto @xmath79 @xmath87 the sfc @xmath88 describes the mean ( or smoothed ) field of the mode @xmath77 .",
    "the wavelet function coefficient ( wfc ) , @xmath89 , in eq.(16 ) is obtained by projecting @xmath68 onto @xmath80 @xmath90 the wfc is basically the difference between the smoothed flux @xmath68 in cells @xmath91 $ ] and @xmath92 $ ] .",

    "we can express eq.(3 ) in the dwt representation by replacing the density difference , @xmath95 , by the wavelet coefficient @xmath89 as discussed in  3.1 .",

    "since the noise is gaussian , this term can be ignored on scales for which @xmath100 is larger than the variance of the noise .",

    "the experimental data used in our study is the same as paper i. it consists of 28 keck hires qso spectra ( kirkman & tytler 1997 ) .",
    "the qso emission redshifts cover a redshift range from 2.19 to 4.11 . for each of the 28 qso s ,",
    "the data are given in terms of pixels with wavelength @xmath109 , flux @xmath110 and noise @xmath111 .",
    "the noise includes the poisson fluctuations and the noise due to the background and the instrumentation .",
    "the continuum of each spectrum is given by iraf continuum fitting .",
    "for our purposes , the useful wavelength region is from the ly@xmath54 emission to the ly@xmath0 emission , excluding a region of about 0.06 in redshift close to the quasar to avoid any proximity effects . in this wavelength range ,",
    "the number of pixels is about @xmath112 for each spectrum .    for all bins in this data set ,",
    "the ratio @xmath113 is constant ,  @xmath114 , or @xmath115 km s@xmath4 , and therefore , the resolution is about 8 km s@xmath4 .",

    "we use only @xmath119 pixels for each spectrum .",
    "thus , each cell on scale @xmath72 corresponds to @xmath120 pixels .",
    "the smallest scales are generally dominated by noise .",
    "we study only scales @xmath121 km s@xmath4 , corresponding to @xmath122 4 pixels or @xmath123 , and @xmath124 km@xmath4 s. since metal lines are generally narrow with doppler parameter b@xmath125 15 km s@xmath4 , ignoring scales less than 16 km s@xmath4 also suppresses metal line contamination . the algorithm for treating unwanted data ( pixels with negative flux or missing data ) and detected metal lines with space - scale decomposition will be discussed in more detail in  4.3 .    in applying our algorithm , we sometimes use the 28 qso transmissions individually , i.e.  calculate the statistics of the transmission over each qso separately , and sometimes all the transmissions are treated together . in the latter case , we divide the data into 12 redshift ranges from @xmath126 to 1.6 + @xmath127 0.20 where @xmath128 . all the transmission flux in a given redshift range forms an ensemble .",
    "note that the number of data points in each redshift range is different .",
    "the simulated samples of the ly@xmath0 forests are produced as in paper i. besides the lcdm model , we also simulate the warm dark matter ( wdm ) model , for which the linear power spectrum on scales smaller than the free - streaming length of the warm particle , @xmath129 , is damped exponentially with respect to the pure cdm model .",
    "the wdm model is believed to be a possible candidate to solve the problem of cuspy halos , or the singular mass profiles of massive objects .",
    "the problem appears in high resolution n - body simulations of cdm models where the models predict central cusps in the dark halos ( jing & suto 2000 ) .",
    "however , observations instead show soft halo profiles as inferred from low surface brightness galaxies and the rotation curves of dwarf galaxies ( flores & primack 1994 , burkeret 1995 ) .",
    "the wdm models are able to soften the density profile of the central core , while at the same time having no effect on large scales .",
    "hence , wdm models are proposed in order to deal with the nonlinear clustering on small scales .",
    "since the cosmic field on those scales is already intermittent , it is important to examine the intermittent behavior of the wdm models .",
    "we consider four wdm models having particle masses @xmath1 and 1000 ev .      in the keck transmission flux , there are suspect data including bad pixels ( gaps without data ) , and negative flux pixels .",
    "the latter are generally saturated absorption regions having lower @xmath130 .",
    "although the percentage of low @xmath130 data is not large , it will introduce large uncertainties in the analysis .",
    "as in paper i , we use the conditional - counting method to treat the unwanted data .",
    "briefly , the algorithm is as follows :    1 .",
    "calculate the sfcs for both the transmission @xmath131 and noise @xmath132 , i.e. @xmath133 2 .",
    "identify unwanted mode @xmath77 using the condition @xmath134 where @xmath135 is a constant .",
    "this condition flags all modes with s / n less than @xmath135 .",
    "we can also flag modes dominated by metal lines .",
    "3 .   since all the statistical quantities in the dwt representation are based on an average over the modes @xmath77 , we do not count all the flagged modes when computing these averages .",
    "condition ( 24 ) is applied at each scale @xmath72 .",
    "if the size of a bad data segment is @xmath50 , condition ( 24 ) only flags modes @xmath77 on scales less than or comparable to @xmath50 . therefore in this algorithm ,",
    "no rejoining and smoothing of the data is needed .",
    "we also flag two modes around a unwanted mode to reduce any boundary effects of the chunks . with this method",
    ", we can still calculate the structure functions and intermittent exponent by eqs.(19 ) , ( 20 ) and ( 22 ) , but the average is not over all modes , but over the un - flagged modes only .",
    "since the dwt calculation assumes the sample is periodized , this may cause uncertainty at the boundary . to reduce this effect , we drop 5 modes near the boundary .",
    "the power spectra of the transmitted flux of the keck data and simulated lcdm samples have been studied in detail in paper i. the spatial distribution of local power @xmath107 show spiky features .",
    "this property leads to large uncertainty of @xmath103 .",
    "now we do a similar analysis for the wdm samples .",
    "1 plots the mean and error bars for @xmath103 for @xmath136 ( @xmath137 km@xmath4 s ) of the 28 qso s pseudo hydro simulation samples for the wdm model with @xmath1 and 1000 ev .",
    "for each qso , we calculate the mean @xmath103 for each realization then calculate the mean over the 20 realizations .",
    "the error bar is given by the range of @xmath103s by dropping the highest and lowest @xmath103 of the 20 realizations .",
    "this is equivalent to dropping the top and bottom 5% of the data .",
    "as expected , the mean power @xmath103 is slightly lower for smaller @xmath138 .",
    "but the error bars of the power spectrum are generally much larger than the @xmath138-dependence of @xmath103 .    in fig .",
    "2 , we present the mean of the power spectrum in 8 redshift bins and on scales @xmath139 to 11 ( @xmath140 km@xmath4 s ) for the keck data and all the simulated samples . on scale @xmath141 ( @xmath142 km@xmath4 s ) and for all redshift bins ,",
    "the powers decrease in the order from lcdm , to the wdm of @xmath143 , 800 , 600 , and 300 ev .",
    "this order is expected , as on scale @xmath141 and redshift @xmath144 , the nonlinear and intermittent features are weak , and the power spectra trends are about the same as in linear regime . that is the power is smaller for smaller @xmath138 , and the lcdm corresponds to an infinite mass @xmath138 . on scales",
    "@xmath145 ( @xmath146 km@xmath4 s ) the trend changes .",
    "this is because the nonlinear evolution is significant on these scales .",
    "the mean power is mainly dependent on rare and improbable events , and therefore , it induces a large uncertainty .",
    "2 also shows that the power spectrum of the wdm model with @xmath2 ev is systematically lower than the power of keck data on almost all scales and higher redshifts ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "therefore , this model can be ruled out by the power spectrum . on the other hand ,",
    "there are no systematic differences between the power spectra of the real data , and the lcdm , or wdm ( @xmath148ev ) data .",
    "the dispersions among these power spectra generally are less than a factor of 2 .",
    "considering the error bars of the observed power spectrum ( paper i ) and that shown in fig .",
    "1 are larger than by a factor of 2 , the lcdm , @xmath149 and 600 ev models are basically consistent with the keck data .",
    "this is one reason for proposing wdm models with @xmath150 ev .",
    "the pdf of the local power @xmath107 [ eq.(21 ) ] for a given @xmath72 are found to be long tailed ( paper i ) .",
    "this property can also be shown by the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) , which is defined as the percentage of the modes with local power less than a given @xmath151 .",
    "3 presents the cdfs of @xmath151 on scales @xmath152 and 11 ( @xmath140 km@xmath4 s ) , and in redshift range 1.7 to 1.9 .",
    "the cdfs generally consist of two parts : a rapidly growing branch at @xmath153 , and very slowly growing branch at @xmath154 .",
    "the latter is given by spiky modes and the former from the passive modes between the spikes .",
    "for a gaussian field , the pdf of @xmath107 is a @xmath155 distribution .",
    "the cdf of the @xmath156 distribution is also shown in fig .",
    "3 ( dotted line ) .",
    "this cdf approaches 1 at @xmath157 , i.e. @xmath5 3 @xmath158 .",

    "we also calculate the cdfs of the quasi - hydro simulation samples for the lcdm and wdm models .",
    "the cdfs of simulation samples are generally in good agreement with the keck data .",
    "only the cdf of model @xmath2 ev on scale @xmath141 shows a strong deviation from keck data at @xmath162 .    on scales @xmath136 and 11 , the cdfs of the simulation samples show a little more rapid growth at @xmath153 than keck data , and longer tail than the keck data at @xmath163 .",
    "the cdf of the simulation samples approaches 1 at @xmath164 ( @xmath136 ) , and 100 ( @xmath161 ) .",
    "this seems to indicate that the long tail behavior of the quasi - hydro simulation samples is more prominent than the observed samples .",
    "however , care should be taken about any conclusion made with the cdfs .",
    "the rapidly growing branch , which is given by the quiet modes , is sensitive to noise . on the other hand ,",
    "the horizontal branch is sensitive to spiky events , and therefore , depends on the number of modes of the sample considered .",
    "therefore , from the cdfs of fig .",
    "3 , one can only conclude that the lcdm and wdm with @xmath165 , 800 , and 1000 ev are consistent with the keck data .",
    "the pdf of the transmitted flux @xmath166 is often used as a statistical measure of the ly@xmath0 forests .",
    "the sfcs @xmath86 defined by eq.(17 ) are proportional to the ly@xmath0 transmitted flux at position @xmath74 .",
    "the @xmath86 multiplied by @xmath167 is the mean transmitted flux in the cell @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , the pdf of @xmath168 is the pdf of @xmath166 smoothed on scale @xmath72 .    as an example , fig .",
    "4 presents the pdf of @xmath168 for the observed qso , q0131 on scales @xmath169 .",

    "4 , we also plot the pdfs of @xmath168 on @xmath169 ( @xmath170 km@xmath4 s ) for a simulation sample of the lcdm model .",
    "it can be seen , even on this small scale , that the pdfs of the simulation sample basically are still consistent with observations .",
    "the biggest difference between the observation and model prediction is at @xmath171 .",
    "however , this difference is sensitive to noise .",
    "5 gives the pdfs of @xmath168 on @xmath136 ( @xmath137 km@xmath4 s ) for the lcdm simulation , but with gaussian noise of different @xmath158 added .",
    "the peak at @xmath171 is significantly dependent on the noise .",
    "moreover , for the keck sample , the noise level is correlated with @xmath166 .",
    "generally , noise is high at @xmath172 , and low at @xmath173 .",
    "this makes the peak of the pdf at @xmath171 more uncertain .",
    "statistics with sfcs @xmath86 [ eq.(17 ) ] generally are more sensitive to noise than wfcs @xmath89 [ eq.(18 ) ] .",
    "this is because @xmath89 is the density _ difference _ between neighboring positions , and the uncertainty of the background noise on large scales is canceled in this difference . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath86 is the mean density at @xmath74 , it is contaminated by the uncertainty of the background noise on all large scales .",
    "thus , one may conclude that the pdfs of flux @xmath166 is not reliable as a discriminator .",
    "with eqs.(19 ) and ( 22 ) , we calculate the structure functions for the transmitted flux fluctuations of the keck data .",
    "a typical result is plotted in fig .",
    "6 , which is given by the keck data in redshift range @xmath174 for all qsos .",
    "the error bars are the maximum and minimum of bootstrap resampling .",
    "it is well known that the higher order correlation functions for large scale structure samples have larger error than the 2-point correlation function . however , even for the 8th order statistic @xmath175 , the error bars are not much larger than that of the power spectrum , i.e. , the second order statistics @xmath103 .",
    "the structure functions are a very stable statistical quantity because the structure functions are a ratio between @xmath97 and @xmath176 , which reduces the effect caused by high spikes .",
    "6 shows that , for a given @xmath10 , @xmath177 increases with scale @xmath72 , and therefore , the intermittent exponent @xmath9 is non - zero and negative [ eq.(22 ) ] .",
    "the distribution of the transmitted flux fluctuations are neither gaussian nor self - similar , but essentially intermittent . at other redshift ranges ,",
    "the structure functions behave similarly .",
    "this conclusion was already found with the local power distribution ( paper i ) .",
    "however , the local power distribution is based on the measures of each individual mode , @xmath89 and has a large uncertainty .",
    "the distribution of local power is not effective for model discrimination . on the other hand , the structure function",
    "is calculated by taking an average among modes .",
    "statistically , they are more effective to test models .    this point can be seen with fig .",
    "7 , which plots the structure function @xmath177 of the transmitted flux fluctuations of the simulation samples for the lcdm and wdm models in redshift range @xmath174 .",
    "the error bars are the maximum and minimum of bootstrap resampling . as a comparison ,",
    "the structure functions of the keck data are shown in each panel too .",
    "we can see from fig . 7",
    "that the structure functions of the lcdm and wdm models show intermittent behavior . however , the @xmath72-dependence of the structure functions of either the lcdm or the wdm models is clearly different from the keck data . for the simulation samples , the slope is steeper than the keck data .",
    "this result shows that the intermittent behavior can not be measured by any individual high order moment or correlation function , but must be measured by the scale- and @xmath10-dependencies of the ratio between the moments .",
    "it is also interesting to point out that the structure functions on small scales @xmath160 , 10 , and 11 ( @xmath178 and 0.4 km@xmath4 s ) are larger for smaller mass @xmath138 .",
    "the structure functions of @xmath2 ev are always the largest one compared to the other models .",
    "this is because the wdm model with smaller mass @xmath138 , or longer free - streaming length @xmath179 , lacks power on small scales .",
    "the density fluctuations on those small scales mainly originate from the nonlinear process of transferring power from large to small scales ( suto & sasaki 1991 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the structure function @xmath177 is the 2n - th moment @xmath180 normalized by the power @xmath181 , and hence , essentially measures the fraction of density fluctuations which undergoes a nonlinear evolution due to transfer of power .",
    "therefore , smaller @xmath138 leads to a stronger intermittency on scales less than @xmath179 .    figs .  6 and 7",
    "show that the relations of @xmath177 vs. @xmath72 for all models and keck data can be very well fitted by a line .",
    "that is , the intermittent exponent @xmath9 , which is the slope of the fitting line , is a constant in the scale range from @xmath182 to 11 [ eq.(22 ) ] , i.e. from @xmath183 to 0.4 km@xmath4 s.      we now turn to the @xmath10-dependence of the structure function and intermittent exponent . from eq.(22 ) , we have @xmath184 or @xmath185 for a given @xmath72 , the @xmath10-dependence of @xmath186 is given by @xmath187 vs. @xmath10 .",
    "8 presents @xmath187 vs. @xmath10 for the keck data in the redshift range @xmath188 . for a gaussian field ,",
    "the @xmath10-dependence of @xmath187 is given by eq.(7 ) , i.e. @xmath189 , which is also plotted in fig .",
    "the figure shows that the difference between the keck data and a gaussian field is greatest at small scales .",
    "more interesting is to fit the observed @xmath10-dependence of @xmath187 with @xmath190 the motivation is simple , as @xmath191 corresponds to hierarchical clustering [ eq.(12 ) ] , and @xmath192 to a lognormal field [ eq.(15 ) ] .",
    "8 shows that the best fit of @xmath0 for the keck data is about @xmath193 on scales @xmath141 and 9 ( @xmath194 and 0.1 km@xmath4 s ) , but @xmath195 or higher on scales @xmath136 and 11 ( @xmath196 and 0.4 km@xmath4 s ) .",
    "this indicates that the transmitted flux is closer to a lognormal field on small scales . in other words , on scales for which the intermittency has been fully developed , the transmitted flux field can be modeled by a lognormal field .",
    "this may be the reason that lognormal models of ly@xmath0 forests match very well with observations not only at second and lower order statistics of ly@xmath0 forests bi & davidsen , 1997 ) , but also with higher order behavior , like the scale - scale correlations ( feng & fang 2000 ) .",
    "figs . 9 and 10 are , respectively , the @xmath187 vs. @xmath10 for the lcdm model and the wdm models with @xmath2 ev .",
    "they are significantly different from a gaussian field .",
    "this is consistent with the cdfs results (  4.2 ) .",
    "the best fit for @xmath0 is always about 0.2 , regardless of scale . for the wdm models with other mass @xmath138 , the results are similar to figs .",
    "that is , the intermittency of the simulation samples is approximately that of hierarchical clustering , i.e. , a mono - fractal distribution .",
    "thus , one may conclude that the intermittency of the simulation samples is different from those of the keck data not only quantitatively , but also qualitative .",
    "the former is scale - independent , and close to a hierarchical clustering , while the later is close to a lognormal field on small scales .      in the last two subsections , only redshift @xmath197 to 2.6",
    "is considered .",
    "for other redshift bins , the result is about the same as @xmath197 to 2.6 .",
    "the @xmath9 against redshift @xmath198 for @xmath199 , 3 and 4 is shown in fig .",
    "the error bars are from the least squares fitting [ eq.(25 ) ] .    in all redshift ranges",
    ", the value of @xmath200 for the keck data is found to be substantially and systematically lower than that of the lcdm and wdm models .",
    "this can directly be seen from with fig .",
    "this is also consistent with figs .",
    "it is interesting that either for the keck data or the models , the intermittent exponents are almost independent of redshifts in the range @xmath201 to 4 .",
    "this is very different from both the observation and theory of massive halos",
    ". collapsed halos with mass on the order of galaxies and clusters undergo a significant evolution in the redshift range from 4 to 2 .",
    "the difference between the statistics of the ly@xmath0 forests and massive halos is probably due to the fact that the qso s transmitted flux is given mainly by the absorption of baryonic matter outside of the collapsed massive halos , i.e. , the weakly clustered area . collapsed halos",
    "correspond to the saturated absorption in the transmitted flux for which the s /",
    "n generally is low .",
    "therefore , the ly@xmath0 forest does not contain information on the details of the massive halos .",
    "11 also shows that the intermittent exponents of the lcdm and wdm models with @xmath2 ev are about the same .",
    "this is also different from massive halos , for which the lcdm and wdm models predict different mass density profiles and number of substructures .",
    "we have simulated the intermittent formation at high redshift .",
    "the results show that in the area outside of the collapsed halos , the intermittency is already well developed at redshift @xmath202 , and does not increase much for @xmath203 .",
    "therefore , intermittency is probably the earliest developed nonlinear feature formed during the evolution from the linear to the nonlinear regimes .      in the above calculations",
    ", we generally take the parameter @xmath204 , i.e. , drop modes with @xmath205 .",
    "the effect of noise on the statistical result can be estimated by the @xmath135-dependence , as large @xmath135 is equal to adding large noise to the simulation samples , but still taking @xmath206 . in paper",
    "i , we showed that the power spectrum @xmath101 is almost @xmath135-independent when @xmath206 to 5 .",
    "12 shows @xmath207 vs. @xmath72 for the lcdm model when the noise and @xmath135 are treated as follows : 1 . ) sample without adding noise , and @xmath208 ; 2 . )",
    "sample without adding noise and @xmath209 ; 3 . )",
    "sample with adding noise and @xmath209 .",
    "12 shows that the effect of noise and @xmath135 should be considered only on the smaller scale @xmath161 , and can be ignored on all other scales .",
    "13 is similar to fig .",
    "10 , but with added noise and taking @xmath210 . similar to fig .",
    "12 , the effect of noise and @xmath135 on @xmath0 should be considered only on the smallest scale @xmath161 and gives @xmath0 of about 0.45 . even in this case , the simulation samples are still significantly different from the keck data .",
    "therefore , one can conclude that all results of  6.1 to 6.3 are not very sensitive to noise .",
    "in the paper i , we showed that in the nonlinear regime , the cosmic mass field is intermittent and the power spectrum will on longer be a critical discriminator among models of structure formation . in this paper , we show that for an intermittent field , the structure functions and intermittent exponent are the critical discriminators for models of structure formation .",
    "this discriminator can be employed not only to distinguish gaussian and non - gaussian fields , but to detect the _ type _ of the non - gaussianity . with the @xmath10- @xmath72- and @xmath198-dependence of the structure functions and the intermittent exponent , we are able to distinguish between various nonlinearly evolved fields in detail .",
    "that is , the intermittent exponent provides both qualitative and quantitative measures of the cosmic mass and velocity fields from the linear to nonlinear regimes and from large to small scales .",
    "we show that the distribution of the transmitted flux fluctuations of the qso s ly@xmath0 forests is intermittent and closer to a lognormal field on small scales . obviously , this conclusion is important in order to understand the dynamics of the clustering evolution of baryonic matter",
    ". it will be interesting to study when this feature formed , and whether the intermittency on scales less than @xmath161 ( @xmath211 km@xmath4 s ) is closer to a lognormal field .",
    "these problems can be studied with samples at higher redshift and higher s / n than the one used in this work .",
    "using intermittent features , even  weakly \" clustered samples , such as qso",
    "s ly@xmath0 absorption spectrum , can play an important role for testing structure formation dynamics in the nonlinear regime .",
    "it is also important to detect the intermittency of galaxy distributions , as the transmitted flux of ly@xmath0 can not provide information of highly collapsed regions in the cosmic mass field .",
    "note that from the definition of the structure function eq.(1 ) , the intermittent exponent is bias - free if the galaxy bias is linear , i.e. @xmath212 .",
    "although the pseudo - hydro simulation samples for the lcdm and wdm models are good in agreement with the keck data in terms of the power spectrum , pdf and cdf of the transmission flux fluctuations , they are significantly and systematically inconsistent with the intermittent features of the keck data . specifically , 1 . )",
    "the structure functions of the simulation samples are larger than that of keck data on scales less than @xmath213 km@xmath4 s ; 2 . )",
    "the intermittent exponents of the simulation samples are more negative than that of keck data on all redshifts considered ; 3 . )",
    "the @xmath10-dependence of the intermittent exponent of simulation samples are close to the intermittency of hierarchical clustering on all scales , while the keck data are close to a lognormal field on small scales .",
    "that is , the model - predicted intermittency is quantitatively and qualitatively different from the observed results .",
    "this is probably the first result to reveal the deviation of the popular dark model lcdm model from the ly@xmath0 forest observations .",
    "however , we should be very careful in reaching conclusions ruling out the relevant dark matter models . for a linear gaussian field ,",
    "all statistics can be determined by power spectrum with given dark matter parameters .",
    "however , intermittency arises from the nonlinear evolution and depends not only on the cosmological parameters , but also on 1 . )",
    "dynamical assumptions of the relation between the igm and underlying dark matter field and 2 . ) parameters used for simulation .",
    "for instance , the lognormal model of ly@xmath0 forests ( bi & davidsen 1997 , feng & fang 2000 ) assumes phenomenologically that the nonlinear field of baryonic matter is given by a lognormal transformation of the underlying mass field in linear regime . the sample given by this dynamical assumption can certainly fit with a lognormal pdf of the ly@xmath0 transmitted flux .    in the pseudo hydro simulation , the density of baryonic matter in each pixel is assigned according to the dark matter density at that pixel .",
    "this is equal to phenomenologically assuming that the statistical property of the baryonic matter is determined by the underlying mass field .",
    "this assumption is reasonable in terms of second and lower order statistics .",
    "however , it may not be correct in the context of intermittency .",
    "that is , although baryonic matter can be considered as a passive component in the system consisting of dark matter and baryonic matter , the statistical properties of the passive component can decouple from the underlying mass field during the nonlinear evolution ( shraiman & siggia 2000 ) .",
    "for instance , a diffused passive substance can exhibit intermittency , even when the underlying mass field is gaussian ( kraichnan , 1994 ) .",
    "this is due to the nonlinear evolution of this two component system .",
    "moreover , the parameters of simulation may also cause uncertainty in measuring the intermittency . in the paper i , we studied the effect of the sample size on the power spectrum .",
    "when the characteristic spacing between high spikes ( long tail events ) exceed the spatial size of samples , the spatial averages cease to coincide with ensemble averages . as a consequence ,",
    "the mean power of the transmission fluctuations is concentrated in rare but large spikes while the other modes have low power , or are even inactive .",
    "we showed that on scales less than @xmath214 km@xmath4 s , 50% or more of the power is contributed by the top 5% modes for unnormalized power spectrum , and 1% modes for the locally - normalized power spectrum .",
    "therefore , before making conclusions about the dark matter parameters , we should study whether the deviation is caused by the dynamical assumptions on the relation between the igm and dark matter .",
    "we should also study the effects of simulation parameters ( size , resolution etc ) on intermittency .",
    "nevertheless , the current result is strong enough to conclude that all theory and models on the dynamics of nonlinear evolution of the cosmic mass and velocity fields must be examined with their predictions of intermittency . for models which are almost degenerate in the linear regime , the tests with intermittency in nonlinear regime are crucial .",
    "finally , we should mention that the dynamical evolution of cosmic clustering was found to be able to sketch by the stochastic - force - driven burgers equation ( berera & fang 1994 ; jones 1999 ) , or the so - called kpz equation ( kardar , parisi & zhang 1986 ; barabsi & stanley 1995 ) .",
    "these equations are typical of dynamical models which lead to intermittency ( e.g. polyakov , 1995 ; e , et al 1997 ; balkovsky et al . 1997 ) .",
    "these examples clearly illustrate that intermittency is a basic property of the nonlinearly evolved cosmic mass field .",
    "hence , we strongly believe that intermittency is a window to the dynamical evolution of cosmic nonlinear clustering .",
    "knowledge of intermittency may ultimately lead to a better understanding of the still intractable problem of galaxy formation .",
