    "the celebrated ising model has in the past been studied extensively , mainly because of its conceptual simplicity in combination with non - trivial features and because of the fact that , in two dimensions , exact results can be obtained@xcite . besides being the best studied model in the theory of critical phenomena , it is for example also discussed in connection with magnetism , surface physics , or even nuclear physics ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent overview on the use of classical microscopic models in nuclear physics ) .    in the present work",
    "we want to focus on the behavior of the two- and three - dimensional nearest neighbour ising models inside the coexistence region . in the temperature - magnetization space",
    "this two - phase region is bordered by the line of spontaneous magnetization , the coexistence line .",
    "investigations inside the two - phase region mainly deal with non - equilibrium dynamics@xcite ( analyzing , for example , the time evolution when the external field is switched or when the system is quenched from high temperatures ) or with the equilibrium shape of droplets of minority spins@xcite . using monte carlo techniques we study the ising model in the temperature - magnetization and in the energy - magnetization space when the magnetization density @xmath0 is fixed at some value @xmath1 .",
    "this approach has the advantage that data both below and above the coexistence line can be gathered without having to deal with the complications of an external field changing sign at the coexistence line .",
    "recently , properties of a surface with a constant coverage of adatoms have been described within a model equivalent to the two - dimensional ising model with fixed magnetization ( imfm)@xcite . the transition between a cluster of monoatomic height at low temperatures and a gas of adatoms at higher temperatures , observed in that study , has led to a subsequent work on the two - dimensional imfm where the finite - size dependences of the stability of minority clusters in small systems were elucidated@xcite .",
    "these system are small in comparison with the asymptotically large systems where rigorous results are available@xcite .",
    "in particular , numerical simulations of systems of finite size showed that the macroscopic droplets of minority spins ( i.e. clusters whose radii scale with the system size ) which disappear at the coexistence line in the thermodynamic limit , do that with the signatures of a possible phase transition as e.g. pronounced maxima in cluster and thermal properties . in three dimensions , the imfm model was considered in relation to nuclear matter fragmentation@xcite . here ,",
    "based on simulations of moderate sized systems , the cluster transition was discussed in terms of a continuous transition taking place at the coexistence line . to be complete",
    ", we should also mention a recent study of the three - dimensional imfm at the critical temperature@xcite .",
    "based on general considerations on the topology of the entropy of finite systems@xcite , one would expect to observe the finite - size signatures of a discontinuous transition when crossing this line at fixed magnetization , but recent numerical studies of finite systems in two@xcite and three@xcite dimensions seemed to be more compatibel with a continuous transition .",
    "our main subject will be the microcanonical caloric curve as obtained from monte carlo simulations of the imfm in two and three dimensions ( analysing a vast range of different lattice sizes ) .",
    "indeed , a thorough analysis of the caloric curve is expected to provide new insights .",
    "furthermore , as a complement to ref.@xcite , we will also discuss the influence of finite - size effects on the thermal stability of macroscopic droplets of minority spins in three dimensions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "our simulation techniques are introduced .",
    "especially , we want to point out how histogram methods can be used for the computation of the caloric curve . in section 3",
    ", microcanonical caloric curves of the imfm in two and three dimensions are discussed in detail , whereas the thermal stabilty of three - dimensional extensive droplets on finite lattices is investigated in section 4 .",
    "finally , section 5 gives our conclusions .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) calculations have been developed into a universally applicable tool for problems which defy an exact solution by analytical methods . in statistical mechanics",
    "many of these extremely difficult problems occur in the vicinity of phase transitions . there",
    "the mc method serves the purpose of calculating the mean values of physically interesting quantities as e.g. the energy density or the magnetization density of the system .",
    "the dissipation fluctuation theorem relates the response functions to the mean values of the spontaneous fluctuations of the corresponding densities . for the examples mentioned above the fluctuations yield the specific heat and the magnetic susceptibility , respectively .",
    "the main purpose of mc calculations is thus the determination of mean values of densities and of their fluctuations .",
    "most calculations are performed for the experimentally relevant situation where the system of interest is in contact with a thermostat . there",
    "the microstates @xmath2 of the system appear according to the canonical distribution @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the value of the energy in the microstate @xmath2 , @xmath5 is the inverse temperature of the thermostat and @xmath6 the partition function @xmath7 in conventional mc calculations an approximation for the mean value of the energy @xmath8 is directly obtained in the course of the mc run by sampling the energy values @xmath9 at @xmath10 sufficiently distant instants @xmath11 of the calculation @xmath12 the mean value of the fluctuations are obtained by summing the equivalent expression for @xmath13 .    in recent years , however , the direct summation has frequently been replaced by the histogram method@xcite .",
    "there one tries to find an approximation for the degeneracy @xmath14 of the energy levels @xmath15 of the system @xmath16 to this end the energy values @xmath9 at the instants @xmath11 are collected into a histogram : @xmath17 eq .",
    "( [ gl:6 ] ) can be solved for @xmath14 in the energy range where the statistical errors on the right hand side are sufficiently small .",
    "@xmath18 is an undetermined constant .",
    "nothing is lost when a histogram is stored instead of the mean values . on the contrary",
    "there are several advantages : ( 1 ) once @xmath14 has been established , the canonical mean value of any function @xmath19 of the energy can easily be calculated afterwards : @xmath20 with @xmath21 ( 2 ) as indicated by the prime in the formula ( [ gl:7 ] ) , @xmath22 may deviate by a small amount from the value of @xmath5 which has been used in the simulation where @xmath14 was established .",
    "this allows the determination of the temperature dependence of @xmath23 in a small range around @xmath24 .",
    "( 3 ) with an algorithm that finds the best values for the undetermined constants @xmath18 , histograms of mc runs at several temperatures may be combined to yield a single broad histogam which may then be used to find the temperature dependence of @xmath23 over the desired range@xcite .",
    "here we shall exploit yet another advantage of the histogram method .",
    "( 4 ) from the entropy @xmath25 and the microcanonical definition @xmath26 one finds the microcanonical inverse temperature @xmath27 . for a finite system",
    "a plot of @xmath28 versus @xmath29 ( the microcanonical caloric curve ) shows a lot more detail than the equivalent canonical plot of @xmath30 as a function of @xmath31 .",
    "the sum in ( [ gl:3 ] ) involves an average over many energy levels , whereas ( [ gl:9 ] ) exhibits local anomalies of the density of states .",
    "there is furthermore no need to determine the constants @xmath18 of mc runs at different temperatures .",
    "these drop out when the derivative is performed in ( [ gl:9 ] ) .",
    "the bits of the @xmath28 versus @xmath32 curve from the different runs join smoothly without any further need for adjustment .    here",
    "we consider two and three dimensional ising systems with ferromagnetic nearest neighbour interactions .",
    "the natural variables of the entropy are the energy @xmath28 and the magnetization @xmath33 .",
    "we are interested in the thermal behavior of a system with clamped magnetization @xmath34 , which can be deduced from @xmath35 , the degeneracy of the states with fixed magnetization as a function of the energy .",
    "fixing the magnetization means fixing the number of minority spins . at low energies almost all",
    "the minority spins form one big droplet whereas at high energies one observes a large number of small droplets composed of only a few minority spins .    in order to find @xmath35 we perform a conventional canonical mc run at a temperature @xmath24 . at",
    "the start the system is prepared in any one of the states with @xmath34 and with an arbitrary energy @xmath15 . during the procedure we randomly select one spin in the system and try to flip it .",
    "the flip leads to a new state with energy @xmath36 and magnetization @xmath37 .",
    "the flip is not performed if @xmath38 or if @xmath39 .",
    "if @xmath37 is equal to one of the three admitted values @xmath40 , @xmath41 of the magnetization , the spin is flipped with probability 1 if @xmath42 , and it is flipped with probability @xmath43 if @xmath44 .",
    "after every 1000 attempted spin flips a histogram @xmath45 is augmented by 1 count at the actual value of @xmath28 and @xmath33 .",
    "this way one obtains estimators for @xmath46 for the three allowed values of the magnetization and for a range of energies centered around @xmath47 ( [ gl:7 ] ) .",
    "alternatively , one might have used kawasaki dynamics , but our approach has the advantage that three independent histograms for the three allowed values of the magnetization are obtained in one run .    the degeneracy @xmath35 can now be exploited in different ways .",
    "one can e.g.  calculate @xmath23 from ( [ gl:7 ] ) . for large enough systems",
    "this corresponds to a sampling of @xmath19 with a gaussian distribution function centered at the most probable value of @xmath48 of @xmath28 which solves @xmath49 .",
    "the width of the distribution @xmath50 depends on the number @xmath51 of spins in the system , but it tends to a constant for large system sizes . on the extensive energy scale @xmath19 is therefore sampled over a constant range @xmath52 of energies and the relative width of the distribution @xmath53 with @xmath54 ( @xmath55 being the dimensionality of the lattice ) tends to zero with increasing system size .",
    "one may also calculate local derivatives of @xmath56 as e.g.  the microcanonically defined temperature @xmath57 or its derivative @xmath58 which serve in the definition of the specific heat : @xmath59    statistical errors in the numericaly determined histogram @xmath35 are unavoidable .",
    "these are accentuated when derivatives are formed .",
    "the fluctuations of @xmath60 and @xmath61 can be smoothed by gaussian sampling : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the normalization .",
    "( [ gl:11 ] ) and ( [ gl:12 ] ) bear some resemblence with the canonical mean values of ( [ gl:7 ] ) and ( [ gl:8 ] ) , but here we have the advantage that the center @xmath28 and the width @xmath64 of the gaussian distribution can be chosen at will - as long as the sampling is restricted to energy levels @xmath15 with sufficiently accurate data .",
    "the freedom of choosing the width @xmath64 is exploited in a compromise between the demand of exhibiting the local anomalies of the entropy clearly and the goal of getting rid of the statistical errors as well as possible .",
    "gaussian smoothing has the definite advantage over any other smoothing procedure that it does not create any spurious features which were not present in the original data . in the canonical averaging procedure ( [ gl:7 ] ) @xmath65 ( see ( [ glnew ] ) )",
    "the value of @xmath64 in ( [ gl:12 ] ) should be as small as possible , but this depends on the quality of the data . in the examples of the next section we were able to keep @xmath64 two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath65 .",
    "therefore much finer details of the caloric curve can be resolved .",
    "besides using the procedure just described , we also simulated the imfm model with an adapted nonlocal spin - exchange algorithm@xcite , especially designed for the investigations of equilibrium crystal shapes , in order to study the thermal stability of extensive macroscopic droplets in three dimensions .",
    "recently , the thermal stability of macroscopic droplets of minority spins in small systems has been investigated at fixed magnetization in the two - dimensional ising model@xcite . inside the coexistence region",
    "the disappearance of these droplets is accompanied by a pronounced maximum in the specific heat .",
    "similar peaks were also observed in three dimensions@xcite .",
    "however , rigorous results@xcite show that for the infinite two - dimensional lattice this transition takes place at the coexistence line . the same conclusion may be drawn from a rather simple and physically appealing argument which we will briefly discuss in the next section when dealing with the stability of three - dimensional droplets .",
    "one may therefore ask how to interpret these specific heat peaks in the light of what is known about this line .    as a thorough investigation of the caloric curve",
    "should shed new light on this problem , we studied the two- and the three - dimensional imfm using the histogram method presented in the previous section .",
    "two - dimensional square lattices with @xmath66 spins and three - dimensional simple cubic lattices with @xmath67 spins , both with full periodic boundary conditions , were simulated .",
    "the system sizes ranged from @xmath68 to @xmath69 in two dimensions and from @xmath70 to @xmath71 in three dimensions .",
    "1 shows the computed microcanonical caloric curve @xmath72 versus @xmath32 for the two - dimensional system at the fixed magnetization density @xmath73 for different system sizes .",
    "here , @xmath27 is the microcanonical inverse temperature defined in eq .",
    "( [ gl:9 ] ) , whereas @xmath72 is the intensive energy @xmath74 .",
    "we emphasize again that the gaussian smoothing procedure ( see section 2 ) used in this plot only reduces the unavoidable statistical errors .",
    "all the features discussed in the following are clearly visible in our original , unsmoothed , high - quality data .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "1 reveals a completely different behavior of the system for small and large system sizes . for not too large systems ( line * a * in fig .",
    "1 ) the caloric curve is monovalued , showing no indications of a possible phase transition .",
    "increasing @xmath75 leads first to a steepening of the curve ( line * b * ) .",
    "after a threshold value has been passed , the monovaluedness is lost and the characteristic s - shape of a first order phase transition in finite systems@xcite is observed ( lines * c * , * d * , and * e * ) .",
    "this backbending of the caloric curve is associated with a segment of positive curvature of the entropy and leads to a negative microcanonical specific heat , see eq .",
    "( [ gl:10 ] ) .",
    "remarkably , large system sizes are needed in order to exhibit the s - shaped microcanonical caloric curve as the threshold value is around @xmath76 .",
    "usually , in first order phase transitions , this characteristic behavior is already encountered for a small number of spins@xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the canonical caloric curve does not show this backbending for any system size@xcite .",
    "one should further note that the same systematics have been observed , as a function of the number of atoms , in the theoretical study of the solid - liquid transition in lennard - jones clusters@xcite .",
    "the convex intruder , where the low- and the high - temperature phases coexist , is shown in fig .  2 for two different system sizes . here ,",
    "the quantity @xmath77 is plotted as a function of the intensive energy .",
    "@xmath78 is the microcanonical entropy @xmath79 whereas the transition temperature @xmath80 is obtained by the double tangent construction : on the major part of the energy axis @xmath81 is a concave function of @xmath72 .",
    "there the tangents of @xmath81 lie completely above @xmath81 , in the convex part any tangent intersects @xmath81 . between the two cases",
    "there is one tangent which touches @xmath81 at the two points with the energies @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "this is the double tangent which determines the transition temperature @xmath80 and the finite system latent heat@xcite @xmath84 at the same time : @xmath85 and @xmath86 note that the curves in fig .  2 are raw , unsmoothed curves , demonstrating the good quality of our data .    from the finite - size scaling theory for",
    "first order phase transitions@xcite it follows that the energies @xmath82 and @xmath83 should tend to their bulk values linearly in @xmath87 , whereas their difference , i.e. the latent heat ( see eq .",
    "( [ gl:14 ] ) ) must approach a constant value if the transition is really discontinuous .",
    "furthermore , the asymptotic behavior of the transition temperature @xmath80 should be proportional to @xmath88 ( @xmath55 being the dimensionality of the lattice ) @xcite , whereas the depth of the minimum of the function @xmath89 should vanish as @xmath87 . in the present case ,",
    "however , the situation is more complicated : the asymptotic behavior seems to be encountered only for the largest systems considered ( difficulties in observing the asymptotic behaviour in first order phase transitions have also been reported in other systems@xcite ) . as an example ,",
    "3 shows the evolution of the energies @xmath82 and @xmath83 as a function of @xmath87 . for systems with less than @xmath90 spins , the energies @xmath82 and @xmath83 do not vary linearly in @xmath87 .",
    "the distance between these two energies , i.e. the latent heat , first increases , reaches a maximum for a system with about @xmath91 spins , then decreases until , for @xmath92 , a linear dependency seems to prevail .",
    "larger system sizes , which are beyond our present computer facilities , are needed to affirm unambiguously that the asymptotic regime has been reached .",
    "turning now to the three - dimensional case , we show in fig .",
    "4 the microcanonical caloric curve for the fixed magnetization density @xmath93 as a function of the linear size @xmath75 of the system . the same systematic behavior as in two dimensions is observed . around @xmath94 spins",
    "are needed in order to observe the typical s - shape of a continuous transition .",
    "5 shows the caloric curve of systems with @xmath95 and different values of the fixed magnetization . at higher magnetizations , the phase transition takes place at lower values of the microcanonical temperature @xmath32 , as would have been expected from the shape of the coexistence line .",
    "remarkably , the discontinuous character of the transition is , at a given system size , much more pronounced at larger values of the magnetization . for small magnetization , see line * f * in fig .  5 , the caloric curve for @xmath95 is monovalued and does not present the backbending .",
    "clearly , larger system sizes have to be simulated when the magnetization is decreased in order to observe the characteristics of a possible first order phase transition .",
    "this may be related to the fact that along the coexistence line the correlation length increases with decreasing magnetization , diverging finally at the critical point .",
    "our data for large system sizes are in accordance with conclusions drawn from the expected topology of the entropy in finite systems@xcite . with the two - phase region excepted , the entropy is a concave function of the energy @xmath72 and the magnetization density @xmath0 , i.e.  both the principal curvatures are negative . inside the two - phase region of a finite system one of the principal curvatures",
    "becomes positive .",
    "inspection of the eigenvectors of the curvature matrix reveals that the convex intruder should then be encountered when crossing the coexistence line at fixed magnetization , as is observed in our simulations of large systems . on the other hand ,",
    "our simulations of small systems show that the backbending of the caloric curve is not visible for system sizes @xmath75 smaller than some characteristic , magnetization dependent , length which may be related to the correlation length .",
    "thus , our results explain why data from simulations of three - dimensional moderate sized systems ( up to @xmath96 spins ) at low magnetizations were erronously interpreted as evidence for a continuous phase transition@xcite and they refute the recent claim that at constant volume in the corresponding lattice gas model the microcanonical caloric curve does not possess the typical s - shape@xcite .",
    "in this section , we will discuss the influence of finite - size effects on the thermal stability , at fixed magnetization , of three - dimensional macroscopic droplets of minority spins inside the coexistence region of the ising model@xcite . to be more specific",
    ", we will assume a positive fixed magnetization @xmath1 , so that the @xmath97 spins are the minority spins .",
    "by the term  macroscopic droplet  we denote an extensive cluster of connected minority spins with an average of @xmath98 spins whose size scales with the system size @xmath51 .",
    "a corresponding study in two dimensions@xcite has recently shown that these droplets loose their extensivity at a cluster transition which is expected to take place at the coexistence line in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "in fact , one may argue that , in the infinite system , the mean magnetization density in the droplet has the same absolute value as in the rest of the system . as a consequence , the following expression for the reduced droplet size @xmath99 ( @xmath100",
    "being the total number of @xmath97 spins ) in the thermodynamic limit is easily derived@xcite : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the spontaneous magnetization at the temperature @xmath31 .",
    "it follows from this expression , in accordance with rigorous results , that the extensive droplet vanishes in the infinite system at the coexistence line .",
    "note that no assumption on the dimensionality of the system was made for the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ gl:15 ] ) . in finite systems ,",
    "this cluster transition is accompanied by a pronounced peak in the specific heat ( as obtained from energy fluctuations ) , thus showing its connection to the transition discussed in the previous section .",
    "the assumption of equal absolute values of the magnetizations inside and outside the droplet is not expected to hold at high temperatures in finite systems .",
    "in fact , due to the gibbs - thomson effect , which describes the effect of curved interfaces at equilibrium@xcite , the fraction of minority spins forming the droplet at fixed magnetization @xmath1 should be reduced in finite systems as compared to the infinite system , thus leading to a decrease of the reduced droplet size @xmath103 as well as to a shift of the cluster transition temperature to lower values .",
    "this is exactly what has been observed in simulations in two dimensions@xcite .",
    "fig .  6 and",
    "7 show the temperature dependent droplet size @xmath104 for different system sizes @xmath75 in the three dimensional case for two different fixed magnetizations @xmath105 and @xmath93 .",
    "this data were obtained with a nonlocal spin - exchange algorithm@xcite , specially conceived for the study of equilibrium crystal shapes , which we adapted to the three - dimensional imfm .",
    "the dashed lines are obtained from eq .",
    "( [ gl:15 ] ) . for the spontaneous magnetization @xmath106 we used the expression given in ref.@xcite .",
    "consider first the case @xmath105 ( fig .  6 ) .",
    "for this value of the fixed magnetization , the reduced droplet size @xmath104 for finite @xmath75 is shifted to lower values when compared to the theoretical prediction ( eq .  ( [ gl:15 ] ) ) , but it clearly approaches the theoretical curve when @xmath75 is increased .",
    "furthermore , the cluster transition temperature , given by the turning point of @xmath104 , is reduced for decreasing system sizes .",
    "these results are readily understood when invoking the gibbs - thomson effect and are similar to the finite size dependences observed in two dimensions .",
    "note that for increasing system sizes , the decrease in @xmath104 evolves from a slow smooth decrease for small systems to a rapid , almost discontinuous , change for larger systems , in accordance with the systematics discussed in the previous section .",
    "it has been proven rigorously@xcite that at fixed magnetization density @xmath1 in a @xmath55-dimensional hypercube with @xmath107 sites ( @xmath75 very large , @xmath108 ) one big droplet is observed as long as @xmath109 whereas many small droplets with sizes at most as large as @xmath110 are encountered if @xmath111 setting @xmath112 one may derive for a given @xmath1 and a given @xmath75 a typical temperature separating these two regimes .",
    "these temperatures coincide rather well with the transition temperatures defined as the turning points of the reduced droplet sizes , see fig .  6 , even if the rigorous proof only holds in the limit @xmath113 .",
    "the same is true for droplets in the two - dimensional ising model , see fig .  2 in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for @xmath93 ( fig",
    ".  7 ) , the finite system sizes manifest themselves in a completely different and unexpected way .",
    "the reduced droplet size now approaches the theoretical curve from above , i.e. the fraction of minus spins forming the droplet is larger in finite systems than compared to what is expected from the assumptions leading to eq .",
    "( [ gl:15 ] ) .",
    "this behavior is in marked contrast to the gibbs - thomson effect .",
    "our explanation of this behavior is based on percolation theory@xcite .",
    "recall that in the three - dimensional ising model , the percolation temperature @xmath114 for the type of clusters we are considering ( i.e.  clusters of minority spins connected by a nearest - neighbor bond ) is located below the critical temperature @xmath115@xcite .",
    "therefore , for temperatures larger than @xmath114 , an infinite cluster of minority spins , which is not a compact object but a fractal , is encountered at the coexistence line in the infinite system . in the present case , the crossing of the line @xmath116 and the coexistence line is located slightly above the percolation temperature .",
    "it is then not surprising to observe that the extensive droplet contains a larger fraction of minority spins than predicted under the assumptions ( involving implicitly compact objects ) leading to eq .",
    "( [ gl:15 ] ) .",
    "in fact , above the percolation temperature , eq .  ( [ gl:15 ] ) should not be valid any more . the data in fig .",
    "7 show that in finite systems even at temperatures below @xmath114 the droplet has a tendency to be formed by an increased number of minority spins .",
    "these conclusions are supported by results for the reduced size of the largest cluster formed by minus spins in the two - dimensional imfm at magnetization @xmath117 .",
    "note that for the two - dimensional ising model the critical temperature and the percolation temperature coincide . in the simulations of the two - dimensional imfm with @xmath117",
    "larger clusters than theoretically predicted are also observed , in accordance with the fact that the @xmath117 line crosses the line of spontaneous magnetization at the critical ( percolation ) temperature , whereas for all other investigated values of the fixed magnetizations @xmath118 a decrease of the reduced droplet size is encountered when compared to the theoretical line ( [ gl:15 ] ) @xcite .",
    "coming back to fig .  7",
    ", we observe further for large system sizes a discontinuous jump in @xmath104 .",
    "this jump is related to the transition encountered when the coexistence line is crossed , as discussed in section 3 .",
    "in contrast to the case of larger values of @xmath1 ( see fig .  6 ) , where the discontinuous change is at best guessed for large system sizes , the discontinuity in the droplet size is here clearly observed .",
    "this is a consequence of the largeness of the droplets of minority spins when crossing the coexistence line in the vicinity of the percolation temperature .",
    "note that discontinuous changes are also observed in the second moments of the cluster size distributions .",
    "despite of the fact that the ising model has been studied extensively since more than 70 years and despite of its possible applications in solid state and nuclear physics , there are still some open questions regarding its behaviour at constant magnetization @xmath1 in finite systems . in three dimensions",
    "it may serve as a model system for the solid to gas transition of a fixed number of particles in a given volume or for the fragmentation of nuclear matter .",
    "the two dimensional ising model is used to describe the transition from a cluster of adatoms on a surface to a gaslike behaviour .",
    "we have performed a series of mc calculations in two and three dimensions for several values of @xmath1 and for a wide range of system sizes . for large systems the data hint at a possible discontinuous phase transition with a well resolved latent heat .",
    "the discontinuity disappears for smaller systems and it diminishes when @xmath1 is reduced .",
    "it is well known that the canonical ensemble is ill prepared for a distinction between continuous and discontinuous phase transitions@xcite .",
    "all singularities are smeared out .",
    "it is therefore essential that the data , although obtained in normal canonical simulations , be analyzed microcanonically .",
    "there a possible discontinuous transition is clearly visible in finite systems as a convex intruder in the entropy as a function of the energy ( see fig .  2 ) . in a canonical analysis one",
    "averages over a great number of energy channels leading to a loss of information which is especially bad in the two phase region between the two maxima of @xmath119 . in the vicinity of the transition temperature @xmath120",
    "the partition function is dominiated by one or the other of the two maxima .",
    "when the energy is plotted versus the microcanonically defined temperature , the convex intruder manifests itself as an s - shape in the caloric equation .",
    "this is shown in figs .  1 , 4 , and 5 .",
    "there is no discontinuity present for small systems  it develops only for astonishingly large systems . despite of the very large system sizes which have been studied ,",
    "we are not able to assert that the scaling region has already been reached , but larger systems surpass our present computer capacities . fig .",
    "5 shows that , for a given size , the discontinuous character diminishes when @xmath1 is reduced . on the basis of the present data we can not decide if for very large systems there is a discontinuity for all finite @xmath1 or",
    "if it disappears before the limit @xmath121 is reached . for sufficiently large systems and for sufficiently large values of @xmath1 a discontinuity is observed both in two and three dimensions .",
    "these results also explain why the decay of the macroscopic droplets of minority spins with rising energy inside the coexistence region of finite systems is signalled by a peak in the specific heat .",
    "in fact , these droplets loose their extensivity at the coexistence line when crossing this line at temperatures below the percolation temperature . above the percolation temperature ,",
    "the macroscopic ising clusters percolate the system , the crossing of the coexistence line showing up as discontinuous jumps in the cluster properties .",
