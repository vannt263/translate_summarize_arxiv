    "the effect , which nowadays is well established experimentally  @xcite , has remained a challenging problem for nonequilibrium quantum transport theory  @xcite .",
    "after early experiments , which concentrated on semiconductor qds , the kondo effect was observed in single - atom  @xcite and single - molecule transistors  @xcite , as well as in carbon nanotube qds  @xcite , all of which were coupled to metallic leads .",

    ", the intrinsic exchange coupling between layers  @xcite influences the magnetic structure and consequently the transport properties  @xcite . the kondo effect in transport through a qd coupled to ferromagnetic leads ( fig .",
    "[ fig : qd ] ) provides a prime example of many - body effects in spintronics devices . the theoretical model , a local spin coupled to two ferromagnetic leads , was originally introduced to explain the decrease of the tmr with increasing temperature  @xcite .",
    "the model was revived recently , and led to a series of publications  @xcite . in the early stage , due to different approximations used",
    ", the question remained controversial whether the kondo resonance splits in the presence of spin - polarized leads  @xcite or not  @xcite .",
    "the splitting was confirmed eventually by numerical - renormalization - group ( nrg ) techniques  @xcite .",
    "the origin of the splitting of the kondo resonances lies an exchange coupling induced by spin - dependent quantum charge fluctuations .",
    "let us consider a single - level , originally spin - degenerate qd with energy @xmath0 ( measured relative to the fermi level of the lead electrons ) and strong coulomb interaction , @xmath1 .",
    "then , double occupancy is suppressed and the qd behaves as a magnetic impurity .",
    "but there still exist quantum charge fluctuations due to the tunneling between the qd and the leads .",
    "an electron with majority - spin in the qd can tunnel between the qd and the leads easier than an electron with minority - spin , thus gaining a larger kinetic energy . as a result , a ferromagnetic exchange interaction between the qd spin and the lead magnetization is induced .",
    "it lifts the spin degeneracy of the qd level by @xmath2 .",
    "such a spin splitting quenches spin - flip scattering processes for low energies , below @xmath3 , and suppresses the kondo correlations .",
    "it also leads to a splitting of the kondo resonance . the qualitative two - stage scaling theory presented in ref .",
    "@xcite indicates that the high - energy part of quantum charge fluctuations , between @xmath4 and a cutoff energy @xmath5 ( of the order of the itinerant electron band width ) is responsible for a spin splitting given by @xmath6 here we assumed the coupling strength @xmath7 between the qd level and the leads to be spin dependent .",
    "the splitting of the level results in a corresponding spin splitting of the kondo peak in the spectral density . remarkably , it is possible to compensate the spin splitting @xmath2 by applying an external magnetic field , and thus to recover the full kondo effect  @xcite .    in spite of the interest in the problem ,",
    "a _ systematic _ approximation which can account for the spin splitting of the kondo effect in nonequilibrium transport problems has not yet been presented .",

    "the validity of extensions to the nonequilibrium state  @xcite remains to be proven .",
    "+ - the slave - boson mean - field approximation is correct in the limit of large degeneracy and able to capture the physics of the kondo singlet at zero temperature  @xcite .",
    "however , it does not account for the spin splitting since the description of quantum charge fluctuations is beyond mean - field theory .",
    "+ - the non - crossing approximation ( nca ) , a systematic conserving approximation  @xcite , has been successfully adopted to the nonequilibrium state  @xcite .",
    "nca accounts for spin - dependent quantum charge fluctuations and thus for the spin splitting due to ferromagnetic leads .",
    "but , it also generates an additional spurious peak at the fermi level even in equilibrium  @xcite as well as a spurious peak in the presence of magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "such a shortcoming is dangerous in the context of transport , which is sensitive to the electron states near the fermi energy .",
    "the spurious peak can be made to disappear , if vertex corrections are properly accounted for  @xcite .",
    "however , the generalization of nca described in ref .",
    "@xcite does not appear tractable in nonequilibrium situations .",
    "+ - the equation - of - motion ( eom ) approach , which was adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite , is able to capture kondo correlations as well as  in principle  the spin splitting .",
    "however , within the standard decoupling scheme , the spin splitting is lost  @xcite , and it requires introducing an additional self - consistent equation to determine the renormalized qd - level energy  @xcite .    in this situation ,",
    "a systematic approximation , free of the mentioned drawbacks in nonequilibrium , is needed for further progress in the exploration of the kondo effect in spintronics devices . in this paper",
    ", we formulate the problem using a real - time diagrammatic technique , which is a systematic method suitable to describe the nonequilibrium time evolution of a system with strong local electron correlations  @xcite .",
    "we evaluate the theory , accounting for kondo correlations and spin - dependent quantum charge fluctuations , in a conserving approximation making use of an extension of the resonant tunneling approximation ( rta )  @xcite .",
    "the rta was shown to produce qualitatively reasonable results in the presence of a magnetic field at not too low temperatures , sufficient to allow for a comparison with experiment  @xcite .",
