    "there is growing evidence from current observations that the accretion rates of a significant fraction of celestial objects span quite wide ranges from very low to super - critical in x - ray binaries , microquasars and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "in our galaxy , some ultra - luminous compact x - ray sources ( ulxs ) , microquasars such as grs 1915 + 105 and ss 433 , show large bolometric luminosities and high color temperatures ( > 1 kev ) in their high states ( makishima et al .",

    "this relation is a result by combining the empirical reverberation mapping and the features of the emergent spectra from slim disks .",
    "although the spectra of 110 bright agns in the sample of laor ( 1990 ) are fitted well by standard thin disks ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , those super - eddington objects can never be explained within the framework of the standard disk theory .",

    ", it can be seen that the curves of @xmath110 of our model are almost the same as those of the classical slim disk model . comparing with the classical slim disk , in the slim disk with transition regions ,",
    "the angular momentums shift upward , total pressures decrease and the ratios of radial velocity to sound speed increase at the innermost radius , due to the effects of optically thin region . in the inner disk region where the effective optical depth is smaller than unity ,",
    "the diffusion approximation for blackbody radiation is invalid , and the radiative cooling becomes inefficient .",
    "thus the temperature is higher than that of the classical slim disk , where local blackbody radiation is assumed in the entire disk . at the same time",
    ", the lower total pressure resulting from the decreased radiation pressure due to @xmath112 , leads to the smaller viscous tensor ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "therefore , the curve of angular momentum is flatter ( see equation 3 ) and the flow becomes more dense .",
    "the accretion flow reaches the sonic point earlier than the classical slim disk , since the sound speed @xmath114 is much smaller and the ratio @xmath115 becomes larger .",
    "this explains why the transonic positions shift outwards , compared with those in abramowicz et al .",
    "( 1988 ) .",
    "as well known , the accretion flow has four types of transonic cases , according to which kind of pressure ( gas or radiation ) is dominant at the sonic point and the magnitude of the viscosity parameter . for low @xmath6",
    ", it is total pressure that pushes the flow pass through the sonic point . while for large @xmath6 , the action of viscosity drives the flow across the transonic point . fig .",
    "3 shows the dependency of the transonic radius on the accretion rate and the viscosity parameter for a black hole of 10 @xmath81 .",
    "it is apparent that the transition to an optically thin region moves the transonic point out , when the accretion rate is in the range @xmath116 and the viscosity parameter is @xmath117 . in other parameter space comprising @xmath118 and @xmath6 ,",
    "the transonic location in our result is almost the same as that of the classical slim disk .",
    "the transonic flows with transition regions of high viscosity can be compared with the flows of low viscosity .",
    "first , they are both radiation pressure dominated for super - critical accretion rates .",
    "second , they are different in some properties .",
    "one of them is manifested in the optical depth .",
    "the accretion flow is almost entirely optically thick for a small viscosity parameter , e.g. @xmath119 . while the transition region appears for a large @xmath6 ( if @xmath6 is large enough , the inner flow can be purely optically thin and gas - pressure dominated ) .",
    "another distinct feature lies in the position of the sonic point . for low @xmath6",
    ", the flow can not acquire enough velocity to transonic until it is near the marginal bound orbit ( 2 @xmath24 ) , since the sound speed is relatively high and the viscosity - driven process is not efficient . on the contrary ,",
    "the sound speed of the flow with large @xmath6 is small , the sonic point locates far outside of the last stable orbit ( 3 @xmath24 ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the transonic situation of the accretion flow with transition region is , to some extent , between the case of low viscosity and that of high viscosity in the classical slim disk .    the s - shaped curves for different parameters are shown in fig .",
    "4 . it is found that they are strongly affected by the transition region when the viscosity is high .",
    "for the case of stellar - mass black holes , the upper adaf and the middle unstable branches change much . the upper branch due to advection",
    "is modified , and the unstable branch is compressed .",
    "the appearance of the transition to an optically thin region lowers the radiation efficiency , hence the advection becomes more important . in the accretion flows of smbhs ,",
    "the s - shaped curves are less altered , as shown in panels ( c ) and ( d ) in fig .",
    "it is easy to understand the curves are not seriously influenced in the outer region , since there the optical depth is large and it tends to be the classical slim disk .",
    "the distorted s - shaped curves may have observational features in stellar black hole accretions .",
    "the transition timescale from the upper to the lower branches , @xmath120 , will be shorter than that of the classical slim disk .",
    "for example with the same parameters , the difference at @xmath121 has a factor of @xmath122 .",
    "but the transition timescale from the lower branch to the upper , @xmath123 , is unchanged and greater than @xmath120 .",
    "this would be of interest in the explanation of x - ray transient objects .",

    "the transition region influences greatly the structure in inner disk region , especially for the accretion flow around a stellar - mass black hole .",

    "the disk is always geometrically thin , and the solutions can be approximated by shakura - sunyaev solutions . because of @xmath32 , the lower sound speed results in the reduction of half - thickness , in comparison with the classical slim disk model .",
    "the reduced height favors the trapped photons to escape from the disk .",
    "this shape of the accretion flow is somewhat analogical with the funnels in thick disks .    with the emergence of the transition region , the temperature and density of the disk are both larger than those in the classical slim disks .",
    "there are still considerable radiation fluxes in the innermost region after the flow passes through the sonic point , which is pointed out by watarai et al .",
    "the effective optical depth has also been shown in fig .",

    "blackbody radiation is not adequate to describe the radiative transfer .",

    "the situation is similar as the result in kawaguchi ( 2003 ) : the larger viscosity , the lower density , midplane temperature and also the optical depth , but the higher surface temperature .",

    "energy transport in the form of advection is the main cooling mechanism . in this sense",
    ", the slim disk is often called optically thick adaf .",
    "after comparisons , we conclude that the photon trapping effect is still significant , but it is not so severe as that in the classical slim disk .",

    "<S> slim disks have been received much attention because of the increasing evidence for the super - critical accreting objects . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we make an attempt to construct a unified model , in which the viscosity and the dimensionless accretion rate can span rather wide ranges . </S>",
    "<S> we replace blackbody radiation under diffusion approximation with a bridged formula , which accounts for both blackbody radiation and thermal bremsstrahlung in optically - thick and -thin cases , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> thus this allows us to investigate the structures of and the emergent spectra from slim disks in a wider parameter space , covering transition regions from optically thick to optically thin . </S>",
    "<S> we show that there is a maximum transition radius , roughly @xmath0 when @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the emergent spectra from the unified model of the accretion disk have been calculated . </S>",
    "<S> a simple model of hot corona above the slim disk is taken into account for the hard x - ray spectrum in this paper based on wang & netzer ( 2003 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have applied the present model to the microquasar grs 1915 + 105 , narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies re j1034 + 396 and akn 564 . </S>",
    "<S> our model can explain well the broadband x - ray spectra of narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies , microquasars and possible ultra - luminous compact x - ray sources . </S>",
    "<S> the present model can be widely applied to the candidates of super - critical accreting objects . </S>"
