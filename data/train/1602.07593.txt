    "the vickrey - clarke - groves ( vcg ) mechanism stands as one of the pillars of mechanism design theory , but in the real world is used with surprising rarity . in past work",
    ", this mismatch between theory and practice has been attributed to a number of properties that affect the mechanism in certain settings , like susceptibility to collusion or prohibitive computational costs  @xcite . here",
    "we identify another property of the mechanism that may be problematic in practice , a relative lack of robustness to inaccuracies in the choice of its parameters . unlike most of the known deficiencies it applies already in settings with unit demand .",
    "we start from the standard position auction model of @xcite and @xcite , where  @xmath0 bidders compete for the assignment of  @xmath1 positions .",
    "bidders have unit demand and the value of bidder  @xmath2 for position  @xmath3 is given by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a bidder - specific value and a non - increasing vector @xmath6 describes the relative values of the positions . the most prominent application of this model is to sponsored search , which contributed over 90% to google s revenue of $ 66 billion in 2014 .",
    "what is rather curious is that all successful sponsored search services have used non - truthful auction mechanisms .",
    "overture , the first company to provide such a service , used a generalized first - price ( gfp ) mechanism .",
    "google and microsoft use a generalized second - price ( gsp ) mechanism .",
    "facebook does use the vcg mechanism to place ads , but not in the context of sponsored search and not in a position auction .",
    "it is hard to say in retrospect what led to the choice of non - truthful mechanisms over a truthful one , and changing the mechanism at this point would clearly come with huge financial risks .",
    "we will see , however , that under certain assumptions choosing the non - truthful mechanisms may have been wise even if it was not entirely deliberate .",
    "a mechanism for the above setting accepts a bid  @xmath7 for each bidder  @xmath2 and from these bids determines a one - to - one assignment of bidders to positions and a monetary payment for each bidder .",
    "bidder behavior can then be analyzed using game - theoretic reasoning , where it is commonly assumed that each bidder tries to maximize the value of its assigned position minus its payment . in the vcg mechanism in particular",
    "it is an equilibrium for each bidder to bid its true valuation , and we refer to the resulting assignment and payments in a given situation as the truthful vcg outcome .",
    "in addition to the standard model of auction theory , where bidders have only probabilistic information about one another s valuations , it has become common to analyze position auctions also in a complete - information model where valuations are common knowledge among the bidders .",
    "this is motivated by practical auctions that provide bidders with aggregate statistics of others bids and thus enable best - response bidding , by empirical support that has been given for a family of nash equilibria  @xcite , and by cyclic bidding behavior observed in the absence of pure nash equilibria  @xcite .",
    "the bid  @xmath7 can be interpreted alternatively as a vector of bids @xmath8 , one for each position  @xmath3 . here",
    "we vary the standard model by assuming that mechanisms instead work with bids @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is another non - increasing vector and generally @xmath11 .",
    "we then ask for which values of  @xmath12 and  @xmath13 different mechanisms obtain the truthful vcg outcome in equilibrium .",
    "intuitively this question concerns the robustness of mechanisms to uncertainty regarding the true value of  @xmath13 .",
    "it draws its motivation from current practice to infer  @xmath13 from data using machine learning techniques , which will hopefully produce a good estimate @xmath14 but will usually mean that @xmath11 .",
    "this is , however , not currently being done  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed there are good reasons why the value of a position may depend on other factors besides the probability of a click .",
    "@xcite for example considers a situation with two types of users of a search engine , one of them genuinely interested in the products being advertised and one merely curious .",
    "the two types come with different rates at which clicks on an advertisement result in a purchase , but are indistinguishable from the point of view of the search engine . ]",
    "the truthful vcg outcome is a natural point of reference for at least two reasons . under complete information it coincides with the bidder - optimal envy - free outcome , which happens to be unique  @xcite . under incomplete information",
    "it is the unique outcome compatible with the maximization of social welfare  @xcite .",
    "we show that under both complete and incomplete information a non - truthful mechanism obtains the truthful vcg outcome in an equilibrium for a strictly larger set of values of  @xmath12 and  @xmath13 than the vcg mechanism itself .",
    "failure of the vcg mechanism to support the truthful vcg outcome in fact occurs already when  @xmath12 is very close to  @xmath13 .",
    "the result for complete information concerns the gsp mechanism and is developed in section  [ sec : complete ] in two steps . through direct arguments that combine the equilibrium conditions and the structure of allocation and payments in the truthful vcg outcome",
    "we obtain precise characterizations , for both the vcg and the gsp mechanism , of those values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 that enable this outcome in equilibrium .",
    "we then exploit the recursive nature of vcg payments to show that any violation of the characterization for the gsp mechanism necessarily leads to a violation of the characterization for the vcg mechanism .    in section  [ sec : incomplete ] the same type of result is shown for incomplete information , but here the vcg mechanism is compared to the gfp mechanism and a more elaborate argument is required to establish superiority of the latter .",
    "we begin with a standard technique for characterizing equilibria , by equating the expected payments in a welfare - maximizing equilibrium as given by myerson s lemma with the respective payments in the two mechanisms .",
    "this gives us a candidate equilibrium bidding function for each the two mechanisms , and each of these functions constitutes an equilibrium if and only if it is strictly increasing almost everywhere .",
    "in the case of the vcg mechanism we encounter an ordinary differential equation , but avoid the use of heavy machinery by appealing to a surprising combinatorial equivalence . even with the bidding functions for the vcg and gfp mechanisms at hand it is not trivial to show that the latter is increasing for a larger set of values of  @xmath12 and  @xmath13 , and we use a surprising connection between the two functions to show that this is indeed the case .    that the vcg mechanism fails",
    "already when  @xmath12 is very close to  @xmath13 is shown by means of two examples in sections  [ sec : complete - example ] and  [ sec : incomplete - example ] . in these examples",
    "equilibria supporting the truthful vcg outcome cease to exist when mechanisms underestimate the value of less valuable positions .",
    "this makes the less valuable positions more attractive by reducing their associated payments , incentivizing bidders to shade their bid and do so more strongly as their value increases .",
    "the relatively lower payments in the vcg mechanism only magnify this effect and cause it to fail for smaller discrepancies between  @xmath12 and  @xmath13 . in settings with sufficiently many positions",
    "the failure also occurs when mechanisms overestimate the quality of some positions but underestimate the quality of others .",
    "more generally , the gsp and gfp mechanisms seem to benefit from the relative simplicity of their payments , which for a given position depend only on one bid . in the vcg mechanism a particular bid",
    "may simultaneously affect the payments of many bidders , setting the correct equilibrium payments thus becomes impossible more quickly as  @xmath12 and  @xmath13 move out of alignment .",
    "an orthogonal requirement for equilibrium existence that favors different non - truthful mechanisms under complete and incomplete information is that a bidder s ability to control its own payment must match the degree of knowledge it has of other bidders valuations .",
    "it is well known , for example , that the gfp mechanism may not possess a pure nash equilibrium under complete information  @xcite and that the gsp mechanisms may not possess a welfare - maximizing bayes - nash equilibrium under incomplete information  @xcite , even when  @xmath15 .",
    "the main focus of our analysis is on mechanisms and parameters currently in use .",
    "the investigation of additional mechanisms and parameters , and of the interaction between the auction mechanisms and the learning algorithm used to infer  @xmath13 from data , provide ample scope for future work .",
    "an increased robustness of non - truthful mechanisms for position auctions in the sense we discuss here was first suggested by @xcite , who compared the gsp and vcg mechanisms in a complete - information setting .",
    "this result was then strengthened by @xcite , who identified a single value of  @xmath12 with which the gsp and gfp mechanisms respectively obtain the truthful vcg outcome under complete and incomplete information for all values of  @xmath13  @xcite , as well as a single gfp mechanism with more expressive bids that achieves the same under both complete and incomplete information  @xcite .",
    "what distinguishes our results from this past work is that they characterize , for any given value of  @xmath13 , which values of  @xmath12 enable the truthful vcg outcome .",
    "they thus apply in particular to mechanisms currently in use .    the performance of the vcg mechanism and that of alternative , non - truthful mechanisms have also been compared in the standard position auction model , where @xmath15 , and a number of authors have noted certain advantages or lack of disadvantages of the alternative mechanisms . under complete information , the gsp mechanism obtains the truthful vcg outcome in a locally envy - free equilibrium , and payments that at least match those of the truthful vcg outcome in any locally envy - free equilibrium  @xcite . under incomplete information",
    "the gfp mechanism admits a unique bayes - nash equilibrium , which yields the truthful vcg outcome  @xcite .",
    "each of the two mechanisms has severe disadvantages in the respective other setting , such as non - existence of a pure nash equilibrium or of an efficient bayes - nash equilibrium  @xcite . in cases where equilibria exist",
    ", however , the worst - case welfare loss is bounded in the sense of a small price of anarchy  @xcite . and",
    "@xmath13 for which the price of stability is one .",
    "arguments similar to the ones used to establish the price - of - anarchy guarantees for the standard model also apply to the more general setting we study here , providing welfare guarantees that degrade gracefully in  @xmath12 and  @xmath13 . ] in the standard model , and other things being equal , the vcg mechanism of course has the advantage of truthfulness .",
    "our results concern a more general and arguably more realistic model and apply in a very similar way to both complete- and incomplete - information environments .",
    "a concurrent line of research has sought to emphasize the advantages of non - revelation mechanisms for position auctions under incomplete information  @xcite .",
    "in addition to uniqueness of equilibria these include computational tractability , amenability to statistical inference , and the ability to approximately maximize welfare in general one - dimensional environments .",
    "our results finally fit more generally into an increasing body of work that emphasizes robustness and simplicity in economic and algorithmic design .",
    "relevant examples of this type of work in economics include the literature on robust mechanism design  @xcite and the design of the upcoming fcc incentive auctions  @xcite .",
    "the former seeks to obtain mechanisms with more robust common knowledge assumptions and has in fact identified robustness properties that directly lead to simpler mechanisms as an important direction .",
    "the latter employs a greedy mechanism to achieve computational and strategic simplicity .",
    "additional examples come from algorithmic game theory , where recent work has obtained simple mechanisms with near - optimal revenue  @xcite or welfare  @xcite , but has also pointed out computational barriers to near - optimal equilibria  @xcite .",
    "we study the standard setting of position auctions with  @xmath1 _ positions _ ordered by quality and  @xmath0 _ agents _ with _ unit demand _ and _ one - dimensional valuations _ for the positions .",
    "denote by @xmath16 the set of @xmath1-dimensional vectors whose entries are positive and non - increasing",
    ". given @xmath17 , which we assume to be common knowledge among the agents , the valuation of a particular agent  @xmath2 can then be represented by a scalar @xmath18 , such that @xmath19 is the agent s value for position  @xmath3 .",
    "a _ mechanism _ in this setting receives a profile @xmath20 of bids from the agents , assigns positions to agents in a one - to - one fashion , and charges each agent a non - negative payment .",
    "it can be represented by a pair @xmath21 of an _ allocation rule _ @xmath22 and a _ payment rule _",
    "@xmath23 , such that for each @xmath24 , @xmath25 for @xmath26 means that agent  @xmath2 is assigned position  @xmath3 , and @xmath27 is the payment charged to agent  @xmath2 .",
    "allocation rules and mechanisms are called _ efficient _ if they maximize @xmath28 , where we use the convention that @xmath29 if @xmath30 .",
    "an efficient allocation can be obtained by assigning positions in non - increasing order of agents valuations .",
    "we will be concerned exclusively with mechanisms that maximize welfare with respect to the bids , and henceforth denote by @xmath31 an efficient allocation rule that breaks ties in an arbitrary but consistent manner . for a given vector @xmath32 of values or bids and @xmath24 , we write @xmath33 for the @xmath34st order statistic of @xmath35 , such that @xmath36 , and use the convention that @xmath37 if  @xmath38 .    in reasoning about strategic behavior",
    "we make the usual assumption of quasi - linear preferences and consider two different models of information regarding the preferences of other agents . under quasi - linear preferences ,",
    "the _ utility _ @xmath39 of agent  @xmath2 with value  @xmath5 , in a given mechanism and for a given bid profile  @xmath40 , is equal to its valuation for the position it is assigned minus its payment , i.e.,@xmath41 . in the _ complete information _",

    "a bid profile @xmath40 is a _",
    "nash equilibrium _ of a given mechanism if no agent has an incentive to change its bid assuming that the other agents do nt change their bids , i.e.,if for every @xmath42 , @xmath43 where @xmath44 .    in the _ incomplete information _ model values @xmath5 are drawn independently from a continuous distribution with density function  @xmath45 , cumulative distribution function @xmath46 , and support @xmath47 $ ] for some finite @xmath48 we assume to be common knowledge among the agents .",
    "our results in addition require existence and boundedness of the first three derivatives of  @xmath46",
    ". since valuations are independent and identically distributed , an efficient allocation for all value profiles can only be obtained from a symmetric profile @xmath40 of bidding functions , i.e.,one where @xmath49 for some bidding function @xmath50 .",
    "the quantity of interest for strategic considerations under incomplete information is the _ expected utility _",

    "it uses the efficient allocation rule  @xmath31 and a payment rule  @xmath56 that charges each agent its externality on the other agents , which is equal to the additional utility agents assigned lower slots would obtain by moving up one slot , i.e.,@xmath57 it is well known that the vcg mechanism makes it optimal for each agent to bid its true valuation , and we refer to the resulting allocation and payments for a given valuation profile as the truthful vcg outcome for that profile .    while computation of payments in the vcg mechanism requires knowledge of  @xmath13 , we will be interested instead in the ability of mechanisms to support the truthful vcg outcome in equilibrium when only an inaccurate estimate @xmath12 of the vector @xmath13 of relative values is available to the designer .",
    "to this end we consider parameterized variants of three mechanisms that have been used in practice and therefore studied quite extensively : the @xmath12-vcgmechanism , the @xmath12-gfpmechanism , and the @xmath12-gspmechanism .",
    "the three mechanisms all use allocation rule  @xmath31 , and their payment rules @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 respectively charge an agent its externality , its bid on the position it is assigned , and the next - lower bid on that position , i.e. , @xmath61 we will sometimes drop superscripts when the mechanism we are referring to is clear from the context .",
    "we begin our analysis with the complete - information case . here ,",
    "when @xmath15 , the @xmath12-vcgmechanism has a truthful equilibrium , the @xmath12-gspmechanism has an equilibrium that yields the truthful vcg outcome  @xcite , and the @xmath12-gfpmechanism may not have any equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath11 the @xmath12-vcgmechanism loses its truthfulness , and it makes sense to ask under what conditions the @xmath12-vcgmechanism and the @xmath12-gspmechanism preserve the truthful vcg outcome in equilibrium . to build intuition",
    "we first look at the special case with three positions and three agents , before moving on to the general case .      in the special case ,",
    "valuations are given by vectors @xmath62 and @xmath63 while mechanisms use a vector @xmath64 that may differ from  @xmath13 .",
    "without loss of generality we can assume that @xmath65 and that @xmath66 .",
    "our goal will be to understand which combinations of @xmath67 and @xmath68 allow for the existence of a bid vector @xmath69 that leads to an efficient assignment and truthful vcg payments for all positions .",
    "efficiency requires that @xmath70 and truthful vcg payments are given by @xmath71 in the @xmath12-gspmechanism , the agent assigned position @xmath2 pays @xmath72 when @xmath73 and zero when @xmath74 .",
    "we thus obtain the truthful vcg payments if @xmath75 and @xmath76 , i.e.,if @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "together with efficiency this yields the following necessary condition , which in fact is sufficient as well : @xmath79    in the @xmath12-vcgmechanism the payment of the agent assigned position  @xmath2 is @xmath80 if @xmath81 , @xmath82 if @xmath83 , and zero if @xmath74 , which is equal to the truthful vcg payments if @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
