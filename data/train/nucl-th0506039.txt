    "electromagnetic form factors are fundamental observables which characterize the composite nature of the nucleon .",
    "several decades of elastic form factor experiments with electron beams , including recent high - precision measurements at jefferson lab and elsewhere , have provided considerable insight into the detailed structure of the nucleon .    in the standard one - photon exchange ( born )",
    "approximation , the electromagnetic current operator is parameterized in terms of two form factors , usually taken to be the dirac ( @xmath9 ) and pauli ( @xmath10 ) form factors , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the momentum transfer to the nucleon , and @xmath13 is the nucleon mass .",
    "the resulting cross section depends on two kinematic variables , conventionally taken to be @xmath14 ( or @xmath15 ) and either the scattering angle @xmath16 , or the virtual photon polarization @xmath17 . in terms of the sachs electric and magnetic form factors , defined as @xmath18",

    "the results of the rosenbluth measurements for the proton have generally been consistent with @xmath24 for @xmath25  gev@xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the `` super - rosenbluth '' experiment at jefferson lab @xcite , in which smaller systematic errors were achieved by detecting the recoiling proton rather than the electron , as in previous measurements , is also consistent with the earlier lt results .",
    "an alternative method of extracting the ratio @xmath27 has been developed recently at jefferson lab  @xcite , in which a polarized electron beam scatters from an unpolarized target , with measurement of the polarization of the recoiling proton . from the ratio of the transverse to longitudinal recoil polarizations",
    "one finds @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the initial and final electron energies , and @xmath2 ( @xmath1 ) is the polarization of the recoil proton transverse ( longitudinal ) to the proton momentum in the scattering plane .",
    "the polarization transfer experiments yielded strikingly different results compared with the lt separation , with @xmath31 over the same range in @xmath3 @xcite . recall that in perturbative qcd one expects @xmath32 at large @xmath3 ( or equivalently @xmath33 ) @xcite , so that these results imply a strong violation of scaling behavior ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    the question of which experiments are correct has been debated over the past several years .",
    "attempts to reconcile the different measurements have been made by several authors @xcite , who considered whether 2@xmath34 exchange effects , which form part of the radiative corrections ( rcs ) , and which are treated in an approximate manner in the standard rc calculations @xcite , could account for the observed discrepancy .",
    "an explicit calculation @xcite of the two - photon exchange diagram , in which nucleon structure effects were for the first time fully incorporated , indeed showed that around half of the discrepancy could be removed just by the nucleon elastic intermediate states .",
    "a partonic level calculation @xcite subsequently showed that the deep inelastic region can also contribute significantly to the box diagram .    in this paper",

    "ii we examine the effects of 2@xmath34 exchange on the ratio of electric to magnetic form factors in unpolarized scattering .",
    "in contrast to the earlier analysis @xcite , in which simple monopole form factors were utilized at the internal @xmath35 vertices , here we parameterize the vertices by realistic form factors , and study the model - dependence of effects on the ratio @xmath27 due to the choice of form factors .",

    "iii we examine the effects of 2@xmath34 exchange on the polarization transfer reaction , @xmath36 , for both longitudinally and transversely polarized recoil protons .",
    "we also consider the case of proton polarization normal to the reaction plane , which depends on the imaginary part of the box diagram .",
    "since this is absent in the born approximation , the normal polarization provides a clean signature of 2@xmath34 exchange effects , even though it does not directly address the @xmath37 discrepancy . following the discussion of the proton , in sec .",

    "vi we summarize our findings , and discuss future work .",
    "in this section we outline the formalism used to calculate the 2@xmath34 exchange contribution to the unpolarized electron  nucleon cross section , and examine the effect on the @xmath37 ratio extracted using lt separation . since there are in general three form factors that are needed to describe elastic @xmath38 scattering beyond 1@xmath34 exchange , we also evaluate the 2@xmath34 contributions to each of the form factors separately . in the final part of this section",

    "according to the lt separation technique , one extracts the ratio @xmath59 from the @xmath20 dependence of the cross section at fixed @xmath3 . because of the factor @xmath60 multiplying @xmath61 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmar ] ) , the cross section becomes dominated by @xmath21 with increasing @xmath3 , while the relative contribution of the @xmath61 term is suppressed . hence understanding the @xmath20 dependence of the radiative correction @xmath58 becomes increasingly important at high @xmath3 . as pointed out in ref .",

    "in contrast , as we discuss in sec .",
    "iii below , the polarization transfer technique does not show the same sensitivity to the @xmath20 dependence of @xmath58 .",
    "if we denote the amplitude for the one - loop virtual corrections by @xmath63 , then @xmath63 can be written as the sum of a `` factorizable '' term , proportional to the born amplitude @xmath51 , and a non - factorizable part @xmath64 , @xmath65 the ratio of the full cross section ( to order @xmath56 ) to the born can therefore be written as @xmath66 with @xmath58 given by @xmath67 in practice the factorizable terms parameterized by @xmath68 , which includes the electron vertex correction , vacuum polarization , and the infrared ( ir ) divergent parts of the nucleon vertex and two - photon exchange corrections , are found to be dominant .",
    "furthermore , these terms are all essentially independent of hadronic structure .",
    "however , as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , the contributions to the functions @xmath68 from the electron vertex , vacuum polarization , and proton vertex terms depend only on @xmath3 , and therefore have no relevance for the lt separation aside from an overall normalization factor .",
    "hence , of the factorizable terms , only the ir divergent two - photon exchange contributes to the @xmath20 dependence of the virtual photon corrections .",
    "the terms which do depend on hadronic structure are contained in @xmath64 , and arise from the finite nucleon vertex and two - photon exchange corrections .",
    "for the case of the proton , the hadronic vertex correction was analyzed by maximon and tjon  @xcite , and found to be @xmath69 for @xmath70  gev@xmath26 . since the proton vertex correction does not have a strong @xmath20 dependence , it will not affect the lt analysis , and can be safely neglected .",
    "for the inelastic bremsstrahlung cross section , the amplitude for real photon emission can also be written in the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : m1 ] ) . in the soft photon approximation",
    "the amplitude is completely factorizable .",
    "a significant @xmath20 dependence arises due to the frame dependence of the angular distribution of the emitted photon .",
    "these corrections , together with external bremsstrahlung , contain the main @xmath20 dependence of the radiative corrections , and are usually accounted for in the experimental analyses .",
    "they are generally well understood , and in fact enter differently depending on whether the electron or proton are detected in the final state .",
    "hence corrections beyond the standard @xmath71 radiative corrections which can lead to non - negligible @xmath20 dependence are confined to the 2@xmath34 exchange diagrams , illustrated in fig .",

    "( [ eq : current ] ) , and use phenomenological form factors at the @xmath35 vertices .",
    "this is of course the source of the model dependence in the problem .",
    "clearly this also creates a tautology , as the radiative corrections are also used to determine the experimental form factors .",

    "the result in fact reflects a partial cancellation of 2 opposing effects : the larger charge squared @xmath238 of the @xmath8he nucleus makes the effect larger ( by a factor @xmath239 ) , while the larger mass squared of the @xmath8he nucleus suppresses the effect by a factor @xmath240 .",
