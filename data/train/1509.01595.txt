    "a @xmath6-coloring is _ proper _ if whenever @xmath9 and @xmath10 are adjacent in @xmath7 , @xmath11 .",
    "the _ chromatic number _ of a graph @xmath7 ( which we shall denote by @xmath12 ) is the smallest positive integer @xmath6 such that there exists a proper @xmath6-coloring of @xmath7 .",
    "it is known that @xmath13 these bounds can be found summarized in the text by soifer  @xcite .",
    "the lower bound uses the famous 7-vertex unit distance graph known as the _ moser spindle _ , which we will discuss below .",
    "the correct value of @xmath0 may depend on the axioms of set theory , as shown by shelah and soifer in  @xcite .",
    "in particular , they give a graph @xmath7 such that    1 .",

    "a lower bound for @xmath16 was achieved by raski in  @xcite , when he showed that @xmath17 , so @xmath18 . currently , the best lower bound for @xmath19 is due to nechushtan in  @xcite , who showed that @xmath20 .",
    "an upper bound of @xmath21 was achieved by coulson in  @xcite ; he later improved this result to @xmath22 in  @xcite . in summary , the best bounds for @xmath16 stand at @xmath23",
    "we introduce the _ vector graph _ @xmath24 , a subgraph of @xmath25 , that depends on a set of unit vectors @xmath26 from @xmath27 . given a set @xmath26 of unit vectors , we define @xmath28 the vertices of @xmath24 are the vectors in @xmath29 interpreted as ordered pairs of real numbers .",
    "adjacency in @xmath24 is given by @xmath30 if and only if @xmath31 or @xmath32 .",
    "for example , if we take @xmath33 , then @xmath24 is the ( euclidean ) unit distance graph whose vertex set is @xmath34 .    for a vector @xmath35 from @xmath27 , let @xmath36 denote the counterclockwise rotation of the vector @xmath35 by @xmath37 radians",

    "let @xmath40 be any unit vector from @xmath27 and define a set of vectors @xmath41 as @xmath42 the reason for choosing these particular angles @xmath43 and @xmath44 is so that @xmath45 contains a copy of the moser spindle .",
    "see figure [ moservectorfig ] for a depiction of a subgraph of @xmath45 and figure [ fig : section ] for seven copies of the spindle pasted together , which begins to illustrate the complexity of @xmath45 .",

    "let @xmath51 be a vector in @xmath45 .",
    "we are done if we can show that there are three moser spindles in @xmath45 such that @xmath51 occurs as the bottom left vertex in one spindle , the left most vertex in a second spindle , and the top most vertex in a third spindle ( see figure [ fig : labels ] ) . to see that there are three such spindles , add @xmath51 to all coordinates of the spindle in figure [ fig : labels ] .",
    "this gives a copy of the moser spindle with @xmath51 as the bottom left vertex .",
    "similarly , adding @xmath52 and @xmath53 gives spindles with @xmath51 as the left most vertex and the top most vertex , respectively .     with vertices labelled with vectors , width=288 ]",
    "since the chromatic number of the moser spindle is 4 , we have @xmath54 .",
    "one might think that the vector graph @xmath49 might not be 4-colorable , in the same way that the spindle , which is made up of triangles pasted together , is not 3-colorable .",
    "in fact , in theorem [ thm : moservector ] , we show that @xmath45 is 4-colorable .",
    "[ thm : moservector ] for any unit vector @xmath40 in @xmath27 , if @xmath49 is the vector graph given by ( [ moservectorset ] ) , then @xmath55 .",
    "let @xmath40 be any unit vector in @xmath27 , and let @xmath41 be the set described in ( [ moservectorset ] ) . since the chromatic number of the moser spindle is @xmath56 , we need only to show that @xmath57 .    for ease in notation , and when there is no confusion , we let @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "hence , we may write @xmath62 notice that the set of vectors @xmath63 is linearly independent over @xmath1 . as such , for all @xmath64 there is a unique @xmath1-linear combination such that @xmath65 . define @xmath66 by @xmath67    we show now @xmath68 is a proper 4-coloring .",
    "let @xmath9 and @xmath10 be vertices from @xmath45 with @xmath69 .",
    "suppose @xmath70 .",
    "hence @xmath71 , as @xmath68 is linear .",
    "since @xmath69 , @xmath72 , so we need only check that no vector in @xmath41 gets mapped to 0 .    since @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "we also have @xmath75 and @xmath76 , so @xmath68 is a proper 4-coloring of @xmath45 and the proof is complete .",
    "it could be that proper 4-colorings of the plane ( if they exist ) occupy a place analogous to that of non - principal ultrafilters ; we could never write one down .",
    "for instance , one could imagine a proof that all finite unit - distance graphs are 4-colorable ; this would imply ( by erds - debruijn @xcite ) that a 4-coloring of the plane exists , but it certainly would not give us the means to write one down .",
    "it could be that the presence or absence of the axiom of choice plays a central role .",
    "shelah and soifer @xcite , relying on a result of falconer @xcite , prove that if all finite unit distance graphs are 4-colorable , then even though @xmath77 in zfc , in zf + dependent choice + lm we have that @xmath78 .",
