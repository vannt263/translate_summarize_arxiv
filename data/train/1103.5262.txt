    "<S> in this perspective , i describe recent work on systems in which the traditional distinctions between * ( i ) * unentangled vs.  well - entangled systems and * ( ii ) * melts vs.  glasses seem least useful , and argue for the broader use in glassy polymer mechanics of two more dichotomies : systems which possess * ( iii ) * unary vs.  binary and * ( iv ) * cooperative vs.  noncooperative relaxation dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> i discuss the applicability of * ( iii - iv ) * to understanding the functional form of strain hardening . </S>",
    "<S> results from molecular dynamics simulations show that the `` dramatic '' hardening observed in densely entangled systems is associated with a crossover from unary , noncooperative to binary , cooperative relaxation as strain increases ; chains stretch between entanglement points , altering the character of local plasticity . </S>",
    "<S> promising approaches for future research along these lines are discussed .        </S>",
    "<S> one of the reasons dense polymeric systems so interest physical scientists , apart from their ubiquity and utility , is the wide range of energy , length , and time ( el&t ) scales controlling their properties . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : gshschematic ] , a schematic depiction of typical stress - strain curves for ductile polymer glasses , illustrates the mechanical consequences of this range . </S>",
    "<S> undeformed systems occupy low - lying regions of a rugged free energy landscape . in the linear elastic regime , systems remain near initial free energy minima , and stress is controlled by local forces at the kuhn scale or below . </S>",
    "<S> yield occurs when energetic barriers to segmental rearrangements are overcome ; the resulting increase in local mobility produces strain softening . in the plastic flow regime </S>",
    "<S> , the stress @xmath0 is relatively constant . </S>",
    "<S> strain hardening begins when @xmath1 must increase to drive further segmental rearrangements while maintaining chain connectivity . </S>",
    "<S> this increase becomes more dramatic as the scale over which chains are oriented approaches that of the entanglement mesh . </S>",
    "<S> finally , fracture occurs when cohesive forces , either primary covalent bonds or secondary nonbonded interactions , no longer suffice to maintain material integrity .    </S>",
    "<S> the industrial importance of understanding strength and failure of polymeric materials has made quantitatively predicting the entire range of mechanical response shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gshschematic ] one of the main goals of physical polymer science . </S>",
    "<S> while great progress has been made in recent years towards understanding phenomena at strains up to and including the early stages of strain hardening within a single framework , a coherent theoretical picture including dramatic hardening and fracture remains elusive . in this perspective </S>",
    "<S> i discuss some of the reasons why this is so , and outline possible strategies for moving forward .    </S>",
    "<S> polymer dynamics and mechanics are often cast in terms of polar dichotomies ; a given system is classified as belonging to one `` pole '' or the other . the two most commonly employed dichotomies for bulk amorphous systems ( at least those relevant to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gshschematic ] ) are those between : * ( i ) * unentangled vs.  well - entangled systems , and * ( ii ) * melts far above @xmath2 vs.  glasses far below @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> dynamical behavior in polar limits ( e.  g.  unentangled melts @xcite ) is amenable to relatively simple theoretical treatment . </S>",
    "<S> because the el&t scales controlling relaxation are well separated , one may focus on a dominant scale and then treat relaxation on that scale . in the context of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gshschematic ] , only glassy systems posess a finite plastic flow stress , and only entangled systems strain harden . </S>",
    "<S> flow and hardening have therefore traditionally been explained in terms of local plasticity @xcite and the work required to deform the entanglement network @xcite , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> dichotomies * ( i - ii ) * have obviously proven of great utility for understanding polymer mechanics , but for actively deforming systems , they are less useful . a classic example is the well known tendency of systems _ above _ their quiescent @xmath2 to exhibit glass - like mechanical features when deformed sufficiently rapidly . </S>",
    "<S> significant strain hardening occurs when the product of strain rate @xmath3 and chain - scale relaxation time @xmath4 exceeds unity . </S>",
    "<S> more recent experimental , theoretical and simulation work @xcite has further blurred the distinction between melts and glasses by showing that systems _ below _ their quiescent @xmath2 become meltlike on short length scales under active deformation . </S>",
    "<S> finite strain rates can reduce the segmental relaxation time @xmath5 by orders of magnitude ; @xmath6 drops well below unity at yield . </S>",
    "<S> this drop is partially reversed in the strain hardening regime , and in all cases , @xmath5 increases dramatically when deformation is ceased . </S>",
    "<S> clearly the terms `` meltlike '' and `` glassy '' poorly characterize such nonlinear behavior . categorizing systems as either `` entangled '' or `` unentangled '' can be similarly complicated , because entanglements ( unlike crosslinks ) may be short - lived or long - lived compared to experimental time scales , and their relaxation is also altered by active deformation . </S>",
    "<S> these developments have helped clarify why developing a coherent theoretical framework for predicting the entire range of behavior depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gshschematic ] is so difficult .    </S>",
    "<S> how , then , to proceed ? </S>",
    "<S> the great advances made by conceptualizing mechanical properties in terms of dichotomies * ( i - ii ) * suggest that looking for additional ones is a useful strategy . </S>",
    "<S> it seems to me that two potentially very useful dichotomies for improving our understanding of glassy polymer mechanics are : * ( iii ) * unary vs.  binary relaxation and * ( iv ) * noncooperative vs.  cooperative relaxation . like * ( i ) * and * ( ii ) * , * ( iii ) * and * ( iv ) * are dichotomistic views of the _ character _ of the dominant relaxation mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> the `` poles '' correspond to whether the constituents of a system can be accurately _ treated _ as relaxing independently of one another . if relaxation is unary and/or noncooperative , they can . </S>",
    "<S> if it is binary and/or cooperative , they can not ; instead , one must explicitly treat correlations between constituents . in systems with noncooperative relaxation , a tracer particle would have the same motion in a system where all other particles are frozen as in its unfrozen counterpart @xcite . in systems with cooperative relaxation , </S>",
    "<S> the opposite is true .    </S>",
    "<S> an example illustrating the unary vs.  binary dichotomy is as follows ; suppose the stress @xmath7 is a function of the intra - chain statistics @xmath8 , and perhaps the history of @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is chemical distance . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , suppose the stress is controlled by chain configuration but interchain correlations are either unimportant or trivially integrable . </S>",
    "<S> then the stress relaxation processes are unary . the classical theory of rubber elasticity , which assumes conformations of single strands at the scale @xmath11 ( the distance between crosslinks ) control stress , is a unary - relaxation theory . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , suppose local interchain orientation is important ; relaxation processes will then be binary or higher order .    </S>",
    "<S> a paradigmatic higher - order process in polymers is disentanglement , which occurs when one chain end deintersects another chain . </S>",
    "<S> this is a _ binary _ process because it involves two chains . </S>",
    "<S> while it is often useful to approximate disentanglement as an `` infinite '' order process and `` wrap '' it into a unary mean - field theory ( _ i .  </S>",
    "<S> e. _ , the tube theory of melt dynamics @xcite ) , it is well known that in many cases such a description becomes inadequate @xcite . in principle , binary processes require a formal description that utilizes some two point correlation function @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 lie on different chains .    </S>",
    "<S> dichotomies * ( iii - iv ) * are are not new concepts , and have previously been applied in polymer melt rheology @xcite as well as many other fields . </S>",
    "<S> they are subject to ambiguities similar to those mentioned above for * ( i - ii ) * ; the same system may have unary and binary and / or cooperative and noncooperative relaxation processes occurring simultaneously on different length scales . </S>",
    "<S> many processes are known to become increasingly cooperative as @xmath2 is approached from above @xcite , and remain so below @xmath2 , but predicting the _ degree _ of cooperativity is difficult . </S>",
    "<S> another useful measure of cooperativity is the degree of coupling between _ different _ relaxation processes . </S>",
    "<S> this clearly strengthens as separation of the relevant el&t scales decreases , but quantitative prediction is challenging . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in systems exhibiting nonlinear response , it is typically _ a priori _ unclear which couplings are most important in which regimes . </S>",
    "<S> such issues remain controversial even for simple ( e.  g.  metallic and colloidal ) glassformers . </S>",
    "<S> however , since few theories of glassy polymer mechanics explicitly consider them , opportunities for progress abound . </S>",
    "<S> i now give an example illustrating how even _ qualitative _ treatment of dichotomies * ( iii - iv ) * can elucidate the nature of the crossover to dramatic hardening .    </S>",
    "<S> understanding the role played by entanglements in controlling the mechanical properties of polymer glasses has proven extremely difficult . </S>",
    "<S> the canonical @xcite functional form of stress - strain curves at large strains , `` gaussian '' strain hardening , is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a flow stress , @xmath17 is the strain hardening modulus , @xmath18 is the macroscopic stretch tensor , and @xmath19 is alternately the ( negative ) derivative of the entropy density of an affinely stretched entanglement network , or a neohookean term . </S>",
    "<S> the traditional entropic treatment of strain hardening in glasses @xcite qualitatively captures the shape of stress - strain curves , but has several flaws , extensively discussed in the literature ( e.  g.  @xcite ) .        </S>",
    "<S> much progress has been made in the five years since kramer challenged @xcite the polymer physics community to resolve this issue . </S>",
    "<S> most physically , the mechanisms underlying strain hardening in glasses have been shown to be largely viscous and closely connected to plastic flow @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> yet the underlying problem of distinguishing between models which assign different roles to entanglements yet make similar predictions remains unsolved . </S>",
    "<S> theories which assume entanglements are all - important , and theories which assume they play no role , both predict the gaussian form . </S>",
    "<S> it is seemingly predicted by practically _ </S>",
    "<S> any _ theory which predicts chains deform affinely on large scales , whether based on linearized entropic elasticity , neohookean viscoplasticity @xcite or alteration of interchain ordering and suppression of density fluctuations @xcite . similarly , sub - gaussian hardening , i.  e.  @xmath7 sublinear in @xmath20 , is produced by subaffine large - scale deformation , whether this arises from relaxation of the entanglement network ( as in melts or transient networks ) or finite @xmath21 in uncrosslinked glasses @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> dramatic hardening ( @xmath7 supralinear in @xmath20 ) can be produced either by entropic depletion of configurations for finite-@xmath10 chain segments @xcite or by the increased plastic deformation and bond stretching required to deform chains affinely while maintaining their connectivity .    </S>",
    "<S> formulation of a robust microscopic theory predicting the entire range of mechanical response shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gshschematic ] seems doubtful while these ambiguities remain . </S>",
    "<S> one approach to resolving them is to connect changes in macroscopic mechanical response with increasing strain to changes in relationships between structural features and relaxation mechanisms at different length scales . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : btc ] presents results for the crossover to dramatic strain hardening , which i will argue can best be understood as representing crossovers from unary to binary and from noncooperative to cooperative relaxation phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> results are obtained via molecular dynamics simulations of a simple coarse - grained bead - spring model @xcite that captures the key physics of linear homopolymers . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation protocol is standard @xcite and is described in the appendix . </S>",
    "<S> both flexible and semiflexible chains are studied to illustrate the behavior of `` loosely '' and `` tightly '' @xcite entangled systems , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> panel ( a ) compares the normalized stresses ( @xmath22 ) ) , where @xmath17 is fit to the initial hardening regime ( @xmath23 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the plateau for flexible chains indicates nearly gaussian hardening at all strains . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , semiflexible chains show dramatically supra - gaussian hardening for @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> panel ( b ) shows the energy dissipated per damaged bond @xmath25 for the same systems . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the dissipative component of the stress and @xmath28 is the rate of bond damage per unit strain ( see the appendix ) . </S>",
    "<S> flexible chains again show a plateau , indicating @xmath25 is constant when hardening is gaussian , while semiflexible chains show an increase in @xmath25 for @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> differences between loosely and tightly entangled systems are directly associated @xcite with differing degrees of increase in the energetic component of stress , @xmath30 .    </S>",
    "<S> panel ( c ) shows the correlation in bond tensions @xmath31 along chain backbones in tightly entangled systems . </S>",
    "<S> the correlations are roughly exponential . at intermediate @xmath10 , @xmath32 in the limit of large strains ; the factor of @xmath33 suggests a binary suppression of relaxation , wherein tension is concentrated at increasingly localized entanglement points ( with 2 chains / entanglement ) and decorrelates between entanglement points . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , bond tensions in flexible systems ( not shown ) are much smaller and less correlated . </S>",
    "<S> this is of interest since chain tension relief by covalent bond scission is a key mechanism leading to brittle fracture @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> panel ( d ) shows the probability distribution for differential nonaffine jump sizes @xmath34 in tightly entangled systems , defined by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the position of a particle and @xmath37 is the macroscopic stretch tensor at @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the tails of @xmath39 become longer with increasing stress and strain @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is most pronounced for tightly entangled chains in the dramatic hardening regime ( results for loosely entangled chains are similar to those found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and are not shown ) . </S>",
    "<S> it arises because correlated bond tension at the scale @xmath40 increases the size of local plastic rearrangements , which in turn increases the energy they dissipate ( panel b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> all results in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : btc ] are consistent with crossovers from unary to binary relaxation as chains stretch between entanglements , and from noncooperativity to cooperativity between deformation at the level of the entanglement mesh and local plastic rearrangements at the monomer or kuhn scale . for the strains considered here , these crossovers are present in tightly entangled but </S>",
    "<S> not loosely entangled systems ; all coincide with increasing stretching of chains over chemical distances @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the crossovers in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gshschematic](a - b ) occur at different strains , while those in panels ( c - d ) are gradual . </S>",
    "<S> it seems likely that the unary - binary and noncooperative - cooperative crossovers are themselves coupled , though the strength of the coupling remains unclear . </S>",
    "<S> understanding such behavior at a predictive level may be difficult , but presents an interesting challenge for the community .    </S>",
    "<S> single - chain - in - mean - field descriptions of strain hardening @xcite probably can not quantitatively treat the `` entanglement - stretching '' unary - binary crossover , even if interchain correlations are integrated into the mean field . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , theories assuming a single relaxation mechanism ( e.  g.  segmental relxn . ) can not treat crossovers from noncooperative to cooperative relaxation which are driven by coupling to another relaxation mechanism of different character . </S>",
    "<S> presently , the microscopic theory which most satisfactorily captures the elastic , yield , softening , flow , and hardening regimes is due to chen and schweizer @xcite ; it is based on a strain- and thermal - history - dependent dynamical free energy for segmental rearrangements in the glassy state . </S>",
    "<S> while it captures much of the physics of strain hardening ( e.  g.  its coupling to plastic flow ) by predicting how segmental relaxation is suppressed due to changes in interchain ordering in a macroscopic strain field , and even predicts variations in the character of activated segmental hops , it is questionable whether it can capture the crossovers shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : btc](b - c ) , and it does not treat fracture .    </S>",
    "<S> an interesting feature of the unary vs.  binary dichotomy is that unary relaxation processes `` scale '' linearly with the density @xmath42 of relaxing constituents , while binary processes scale quadratically with @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the reason polymeric entanglement is traditionally regarded as a ( nearly ) binary process @xcite is that entanglement density scales roughly as @xmath43 , where @xmath42 is the density of uncrossable chain contours . </S>",
    "<S> studies of bidisperse systems @xcite ( with constituent densities ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) and relaxation processes which scale as @xmath46 ) should therefore be particularly useful in testing whether relaxation is unary or binary . </S>",
    "<S> many such studies have been performed for melts well above @xmath2 , in which the coupling between relaxation of short and long chains is now well understood @xcite , but similar studies in systems below @xmath2 are in their infancy . </S>",
    "<S> new experimental techniques such as scanning near field optical microscopy @xcite should be particularly useful for these purposes .    </S>",
    "<S> a specific example of how such studies can elucidate causal relationships for polymer mechanics is as follows . </S>",
    "<S> experiments performed on ( essentially ) monodisperse systems remain contradictory on such basic questions as to whether or not @xmath17 is proportional to entanglement density @xmath47 @xcite ; if it is , it is clear that the constant of proportionality differs for chemically different polymers . in monodisperse ( but not bidisperse ) systems , both @xmath17 and entanglement density @xmath47 scale approximately as @xmath48 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this `` macro - micro '' ambiguity led to much controversy over whether @xmath17 scales fundamentally with entanglement density or kuhn length . for systems exhibiting _ </S>",
    "<S> gaussian _ hardening , an apparent resolution of these issues has been obtained via recent simulation and experimental studies of bidisperse systems @xcite that suggest structure at the kuhn level is the more fundamental controlling factor . </S>",
    "<S> however , the ambiguity remains unresolved in the dramatic hardening regime , and the crossovers described above suggest that developing a theoretical description that captures the entire spectrum of behavior depicted in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : gshschematic ] will require a great deal more work .    in this effort , </S>",
    "<S> many of the most fruitful ideas may come from glass _ transition _ physics @xcite , which i believe has been underutilized to date in theories of glassy polymer mechanics ( at least those which treat large strains ) , except that of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> . it may also be profitable to employ concepts developed in recent studies of other `` soft '' systems , such as colloidal and granular materials . </S>",
    "<S> one promising possibility is to determine whether and when the properties of polymers are more like attractive glasses or repulsive glasses @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other potentially useful concepts include jamming , soft modes , inherent structures and energy landscapes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> much also may be gained by working to bridge microscopic theories with increasingly sophisticated new constitutive models ; some especially promising models incorporate melt - like relaxation mechanisms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> i hope that this work will help spur further effort along these lines .    </S>",
    "<S> the results presented in fig .  [ fig : btc ] are a new analysis of earlier simulations @xcite done in collaboration with mark o. robbins . stimulating discussions with kenneth s.  schweizer , leon govaert , mya warren , and mark robbins , and support from nsf award nos .  </S>",
