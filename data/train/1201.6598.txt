    "strongly correlated phases of electrons confined to move in the plane , subject to a perpendicular magnetic field , have attracted significant attention since the discovery of fractionally quantized hall conductivity  @xcite .",

    "the prospect of excitations possessing non - abelian statistics has motivated different schemes for topological quantum computation  @xcite based on these systems .",
    "these remarkable phenomena occur in the fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) regime , when the number of electrons , @xmath2 , is comparable to the number of magnetic flux quanta @xmath3 through the two - dimension electron system ( 2des ) .",
    "correlated fqh liquid states appear at certain partial filling @xmath4 of the active landau level ( ll ) . in traditional semiconductor heterostructures ,",
    "the physics of a partially - filled @xmath5 ll differs significantly from that of @xmath6 ll , due to the node in the single - particle wavefunction  @xcite . as a consequence , the hierarchy / composite fermion states  @xcite , ubiquitous in the lowest landau level ( lll ) ,",
    "are significantly weakened in @xmath5 ll , and some of the more exotic states , such as the read - rezayi ( rr ) parafermion states  @xcite , are likely to be favored . a number of studies have focused on the simplest , @xmath7 non - abelian member of the rr sequence  the moore - read ( mr ) ",
    "pfaffian \" state  @xcite .",
    "the pfaffian , or perhaps its particle - hole conjugate version  the anti - pfaffian  @xcite , with the same topological properties , are widely believed to describe the fqh plateau at @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "quasiparticles of the mr and higher rr states obey the non - abelian statistics  @xcite which is of interest for topological quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "however , for the purpose of _ universal _ topological quantum computation , mr state is not sufficient , and one must go to a higher , @xmath0 member of the rr sequence ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and for a general case ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in gaas systems ,",
    "experiments  @xcite have detected only a weak plateau at @xmath1 , which theoretical work  @xcite has tentatively identified with the particle - hole conjugate of the @xmath0 rr state .",
    "this state , however , is very fragile and has been seen only in a small number of samples , triggering alternative theoretical proposals for its origin  @xcite .",
    "numerical calculations suggest that the appearance of the rr @xmath0 state is linked to the finite - width of the 2des in gaas  @xcite , but little is known about the stability of @xmath0 rr state as the interaction is tuned away from the bare coulomb point .",
    "for example , in case of @xmath7 ( moore - read ) state , it is possible to construct a 2-body interaction  @xcite , resulting from particle - hole symmetrization of the hard - core 3-body repulsion , which yields a ground - state with high overlap with the exact ground state of coulomb interaction .",
    "this model interaction consists only of @xmath9 and @xmath10 haldane pseudopotentials ( to be defined below ) . in case of @xmath0 rr state ,",
    "such an approximate 2-body hard - core interaction has not been constructed , but one could expect that it requires higher order haldane pseudopotentials ( and perhaps some 3-body terms as well ) .",
    "one of the main disdvantanges of the gaas - based devices is that their 2des is buried inside a larger , three - dimensional structure .",
    "this unfortunate fact fixes the effective interactions at values that are often not optimal for some of the most interesting fqh states , including the rr series .",
    "for example , the mr state is found to lie very close to the boundary with a compressible phase  @xcite .",
    "another problem stems from the strong dielectric screening and finite well - width  @xcite in gaas , which weaken the electron - electron interactions and make fqh states fragile .",
    "this has been a major obstacle in the studies of the non - abelian states , which could only be observed in ultra - high - mobility samples  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is desirable to find an alternative high - mobility 2des with strong effective coulomb interactions that are adjustable in a broad range .",
    "recently , a new class of such high - mobility 2des which host chiral excitations with non - trivial berry phases , has been discovered .",
    "these  chiral \" materials include graphene and bilayer graphene  @xcite , and , more recently , topological insulators  @xcite , as well as certain quantum wells  @xcite .",
    "the chiral nature of the quasiparticles gives rise to new electronic properties , including an unusual ll sequence , anomalous hall effect , and suppression of weak localization  @xcite . when these chiral materials are subject to a perpendicular magnetic field , the kinetic energy quenches into discrete landau levels , similar to the usual semiconductors with non - chiral carriers .",
    "however , due to the chiral band structure  @xcite and the fact that the surface of these materials is exposed  @xcite , they offer new possibilities to tune the effective interactions and explore strongly correlated phases .    in this paper",
    "we analyze two practical ways of tuning the effective interactions in chiral 2des , and the effect this has on the non - abelian fqh states . as a case study , we choose to focus on the @xmath0 rr state . in a stark contrast to gaas",
    ", we find that the chiral 2dess allow for a more robust rr state along with the possibility of its realization in _ several _ lls .",
    "additional insights can be obtained by driving transitions between the rr state and the abelian hierarchy state , or the compressible stripe phase  @xcite .",
    "such transitions can be implemented in chiral and _ massive",
    "_ 2des by varying the external field .",
    "overall , the tunability of the chiral 2des allows one to explore a larger region of the effective interactions than has been achieved in gaas .",
    "we consider a family of 2d materials that are characterized by non - trivial berry phases .",
    "one such material is monolayer graphene , a high - mobility atomically thick 2des  @xcite , where recently several fqh states of the type @xmath11 have been discovered  @xcite . a closely related material",
    ", bilayer graphene  @xcite has similarly high mobility , and exhibits interaction - induced quantum hall states at integer filling factors at low magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "graphene and its bilayer are characterized by berry phase @xmath12  @xcite ( graphene - like ) and @xmath13  @xcite ( bilayer - graphene - like with an energy gap ) , respectively .",
    "much of previous theoretical work on chiral materials has been restricted to graphene , exploring the consequences of the four - fold ll degeneracy ( valley and spin ) that leads to new su(2 ) and su(4)-symmetric fractional states  @xcite .",
    "instead , we focus on the high - field limit , neglecting the multicomponent degrees of freedom , and examine the effects originating from the interplay of the coulomb interaction and band structure .",
    "we consider a family of band structures introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , which describe a number of high - mobility materials , including graphene with _ massive _ carriers ( mass is generated either spontaneously , or as a result of sublattice symmetry breaking  @xcite ) , topological insulators  @xcite , bilayer - graphene  @xcite , trilayer graphene  @xcite , and similar materials .",
    "pristine graphene , which hosts massless dirac - like fermions , is contained in this model as a particular case .     of the haldane pseudopotentials as a function of system s parameters : the width @xmath14 in case of the infinite quantum well model ( a ) , the band structure parameter @xmath15 ( b ) , and screening parameter @xmath16 and distance of the dielectric plate @xmath17 ( c ) .",
    "chiral 2des offer the possibility to tune @xmath18 in a much broader range than it is possible within a quantum well model . ]    more explicitly , we consider a family of @xmath19 hamiltonians with berry phase @xmath12 and @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "the case of @xmath12-carriers is realized in graphene , topological insulators , special quantum wells  @xcite ; the case of @xmath13-carriers occurs in bilayer graphene , where the energy gap can be controlled in a wide range by a perpendicular electric field  @xcite . these @xmath19 effective hamiltonians can be derived pertubatively starting from a tight - binding model for each of the materials with a given chirality @xmath20 , however the effective model will be applicable in a narrower energy range for larger @xmath20  @xcite . as it is well known for the case of graphene ,",
    "the one - body eigenstates of such hamiltonians possess a spinor structure .",
    "consequently , the harmonic oscillator raising / lowering operators will mix the different components to produce an effective form - factor that has a richer structure than in case of a simple parabolic band such as in gaas , making it possible to tune the effective interaction .    for @xmath12 carriers ,",
    "the single - particle wavefunctions are given by  @xcite @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the wave function of the @xmath23th non - relativistic ll ( @xmath24 ) , and parameter @xmath15 depends on the ratio @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the mass gap , @xmath27 the fermi velocity , and @xmath28 the magnetic length .",
    "we use the notation @xmath29 to denote the @xmath23th ll for @xmath30 carriers ( @xmath31 ) . as a consequence of the spinor wavefunction , the effective form factor  @xcite @xmath32 that describes the interaction projected to a @xmath33 ll",
    "is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the @xmath36th laguerre polynomial , and for simplicity we omitted the index of @xmath15 .",
    "the form - factor is a mixture of the @xmath37th and @xmath38th ll form - factors in a non - relativistic 2des with parabolic dispersion . at @xmath39 ,",
    "the above equation reduces to the form - factor of graphene  @xcite , however , quite generally by varying @xmath25 , one can realize any value of @xmath40 .",
    "similarly , for carriers with berry phase @xmath13 , the single - particle wavefunctions are @xmath41 , and the form - factor is a mixture of standard @xmath37th and @xmath42th form - factors , @xmath43    the tunable form of the effective interactions eqs.([eq : formfactors],[eq : formfactors2 ] ) provides a way to engineer transitions between strongly correlated phases _ in situ _ by changing the field .",
    "as pointed out by haldane  @xcite , an interacting many - body system of electrons , confined to a partially filled ll , is defined by a finite set of numbers  the haldane pseudopotentials .",
    "for rotationally invariant systems , these numbers @xmath44 represent the amplitudes of a state of two electrons with the relative angular momentum @xmath45 .",
    "the physics of the fqhe is determined by small-@xmath45 pseudopotentials , i.e. @xmath46 . the role of higher @xmath44 s is to enforce charge neutrality , but they do not affect the incompressibility . therefore , the ratio of the two strongest pseudopotentials , @xmath18 , can be a rough indicator of the expected many - body phases . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp](b ) we show this ratio for several types of charge carriers and lls .",
    "the variation of @xmath18 as a function of @xmath15 is to be contrasted with fig.[fig : pp](a ) where the same quantity is plotted for an infinite gaas quantum well of width @xmath14 . in gaas",
    "the width of the well can be tuned by electrostatic gates ; however , it invariably reduces @xmath18 , whereas the chiral 2des allow for both increase _ and _ decrease of @xmath18 , and in a wider range .",
    "up to this point , we have discussed the change in the effective interaction @xmath47 that resulted from a modification of the single - particle wavefunctions , and therefore @xmath48 .",
    "the second method , proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , allows one to directly change @xmath49 .",
    "chiral materials , such as graphene , are often exposed to the environment , which allows for dielectric material to be deposited on top of them .",
    "we consider a setup where graphene sample is situated in a dielectric medium with permittivity @xmath50 , and a semi - infinite dielectric plate with permittivity @xmath51 is placed at a distance @xmath52 away from the graphene sheet . the effective interactions between electrons in graphene change due to the surface charges induced at the boundary between dielectrics  @xcite : @xmath53 the ratio @xmath54 controls the effective interactions within a partially filled ll .",
    "however , the overall energy scale is also modified and this has an impact on the magnitude of the excitation gap .",
    "the gap should be multiplied by a factor @xmath55 if comparison is to be made with gaas 2des .",
    "again , an important advantage of this setup is that the interactions can be tuned _ in situ _ by varying the magnetic field @xmath56 , which modifies the ratio @xmath54 .",
    "the consequences for the many - body system are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp](c ) . in the dielectric case , @xmath18 is found to have a substantially larger variation as a function of @xmath16 than the quantum well model or the tuning of the band structure through @xmath15 . in particular , for intermediate @xmath57 and negative @xmath16 , @xmath18 can be readily increased by @xmath58 compared to its bare value ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "therefore , based on the behavior of @xmath18 , we expect that chiral 2des offer many possibilities of tuning the interactions . by increasing this ratio ,",
    "we expect to stabilize the incompressible phases ; on the other hand , by reducing it , one can drive a transition to compressible phases , such as stripes and bubbles . in the following",
    ", we will explicitly verify these statements in exact diagonalization calculations , and determine the stability of the @xmath0 rr state . in the operational sense",
    ", one can define several criteria for the  stability \" of a state ; the more of those criteria are met , the more ",
    "stable \" the state is .",
    "for example , one can compare the overlap ( scalar product ) between an exact many - body ground state and the rr wavefunction ; if the overlap , defined below , is consistenly close to unity for a number of system sizes , we consider it as one of the indicators that the state is in the rr phase .",
    "however , there are known examples of different phases of matter which possess ground states of high overlap with each other in finite systems  @xcite ; conversely , a relatively poor overlap can not be taken as a definitive proof that a phase is not realized .",
    "additional indicators to identify the phase of matter are , for example , the ground state degeneracy on the torus , and the shift on the sphere ( selected to minimize the total ground - state energy ) .",
    "finally , the robustness of a phase is also determined by the magnitude of the gap for creating neutral and charged excitations .",
    "all of these indicators should be assessed together in determining the nature of a phase being studied .",
    "we consider an interacting , @xmath60-electron problem with a landau - level spectrum given above , on a compact surface threaded by @xmath3 magnetic flux quanta using exact diagonalization . in the study of fqhe , two kind of surfaces",
    "are available that preserve the translational invariance of an infinite 2deg : sphere  @xcite and torus  @xcite .",
    "the two choices of boundary conditions illustrate the specific features of a fqh state under investigation : on a sphere , the fqh state couples to the curvature of the manifold , which is characterized by the topological number called shift  @xcite .",
    "the shift produces a small offset between @xmath3 and the magnetic monopole , whose strength is denoted by @xmath61 , placed in the center of a sphere . as a consequence , different fqh states  live \" in different hilbert spaces and in principle can be directly compared only after extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit . on the other hand ,",
    "the flat surface of a torus leads to a unique definition of @xmath3 for given @xmath60 and @xmath62 , so that different candidate states describing the same filling @xmath62 are all realized in the same hilbert space .",
    "the caveats of this geometry are the additional geometric parameters , the angle and aspect ratio of the torus ; the hamiltonian of a finite - size system depends on these parameters and their specific values favor one fqh phase over the others .",
    "thus , an analysis is slightly more involved but the advantage is that a ground - state degeneracy can be used to identify the phase .",
    "for example , in order to detect a stripe phase , we use a rectangular geometry with a specific aspect ratio that best accommodates the stripe in one direction .",
    "in contrast , on the sphere fqh states always appear as non - degenerate , zero angular momentum ground states .",
    "rr state and the exact ground state in @xmath63 and @xmath64 lls as a function of @xmath15 , for systems of different sizes @xmath60 .",
    "high overlap is found close to the bare coulomb interaction in @xmath5 non - relativistic ll . at @xmath65 ,",
    "the ground state undergoes a change in shift , and a hierarchy state sets in ( right ) . for @xmath66 in @xmath64 ll",
    ", the system undergoes an incompressible - compressible transition to a stripe phase . ]",
    "we will mostly present data for the spherical geometry because this allows for a number of simple diagnostic quantities to be evaluated in a straightforward manner .",
    "the spherical representation of broken - symmetry states , however , necessarily contains defects , and periodic boundary conditions have to be used in this case .",
    "a number of useful insights can be inferred from the study of the energy spectrum ; in addition , we will use overlap calculations to compare an exact , many - body ground state @xmath67 , with a numerical representation of a trial wavefunction , @xmath68 .",
    "the overlap is defined as a scalar product between two normalized vectors , @xmath69 .",
    "if @xmath70 is consistently close to unity for a number of system sizes considered , we consider the trial wavefunction to be a faithful description of a fqh phase . from the knowledge of a ground - state wavefunction @xmath71 , we also evaluate the ( projected ) static structure factor  @xcite .",
    "sharp peaks in the structure factor indicate the onset of compressible phases  @xcite .",
    "rr state and the exact ground state in @xmath72 ll as a function of @xmath15 , for various system sizes @xmath60 .",
    "the region of high overlap is found in the window between the stripe phase and the hierarchy phase . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : z3 ] we show the overlap between the @xmath0 rr wavefunction and the exact ground state of a system in @xmath63 and @xmath64 lls , as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "we set the shift is @xmath73 , corresponding to that of the rr state , and do not consider other candidate states with different values of the shift  @xcite .",
    "rr model wavefunction can be obtained by diagonalizing a four - body short - range interaction  @xcite , which quickly becomes numerically prohibitive as the number of particles grows , or recursively via jack polynomials  @xcite .",
    "the filling factor is fixed at @xmath74 , but in the absence of ll mixing , our results directly apply to @xmath75 via particle - hole symmetry .",
    "the highest overlap is found for the effective interaction that is in the vicinity of the pure @xmath5 non - relativistic coulomb potential .",
    "smaller systems ( under @xmath76 particles ) indicate that rr state might be enhanced for @xmath77 slightly less than 1 in @xmath64 ll , which corresponds to a small relative _ decrease _ of @xmath9 pseudopotential  @xcite .",
    "however , the largest system one can obtain by exact diagonalization , @xmath76 , suggests that the maximum overlap is practically at the bare coulomb point .",
    "it can not be determined with certainty whether this is an intrinsic feature of the rr state or a finite size effect that plagues @xmath76 system .",
    "finite - size effects are generally very strong at this filling factor and further theoretical studies , possibly employing density - matrix renormalization group techniques , are needed . on either side of the bare coulomb point , the rr state",
    "is quickly destroyed .",
    "on the left , for @xmath66 in @xmath64 ll , there is an incompressible - compressible transition to a stripe phase . as mentioned earlier , states with broken translational symmetry are not adequately represented in the spherical geometry ; however we can still detect the stripe by the presence of a sharp peak in the structure factor .",
    "one arrives at the same conclusion ( but more transparently ) in the torus geometry , where it is found that the system develops a manifold of nearly degenerate ground states for @xmath66 that are characterized by a linear ( uni - directional ) array of pseudomomenta that defines the preferred direction of a stripe .",
    "as we move away from the pure coulomb point in @xmath63 ll , the ground state undergoes a change in shift for @xmath78 in order to minimize the energy .",
    "the new value of the shift is that of a hierarchy state .",
    "therefore , in chiral 2des , one can in principle study a subtle phase transition between two topological phases with abelian and non - abelian excitations .",
    "an interesting feature , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : z3_bilayer ] , is the presence of @xmath0 rr correlations in a @xmath72 ll . note that the effective interaction in this case interpolates between pure @xmath6 and @xmath79 ( non - relativistic ) ll coulomb repulsion ; therefore it is quite different from the @xmath5 ll form - factor ( fig.[fig : z3 ] ) . in this case , rr state appears in a narrow window , between the stripe phase ( for @xmath80 ) and the hierarchy state ( shaded region in fig .",
    "[ fig : z3_bilayer ] , for @xmath81 ) .",
    "we note that @xmath82 system has a significantly poorer overlap than all the other systems considered , including a larger @xmath76 system , which leads us to conclude that the poor overlap might be a finite - size effect .",
    "more importantly , the excitation gap in the window where the ground state is well - described by the rr wavefunction is very small ( and also smaller than in @xmath63,@xmath64 lls ) .",
    "this , together with the presence of a strong incompressible hierarchy phase , would make it difficult to observe experimentally .    ) at @xmath74 for the generalized material described by eq .",
    "[ eq : formfactor_general ] .",
    "the gap smoothly decreases from the hierarchy phase down to zero ( stripe phase ) .",
    "rr state appears in the transition region .",
    "the gaps are calculated for @xmath82 particles at the shift @xmath73 . ]    in the remainder of this paper , we investigate the dependence of the excitation gap as we tune the parameters of the system . as mentioned above , the experimental gap at @xmath1 is tiny .",
    "it is therefore essential to find ways to enhance this gap in order to manipulate the state , e.g. via surface probes . to this end",
    ", we consider a generalized model for the material that involves a superposition of @xmath6 , @xmath5 and @xmath79 ll non - relativistic form factors  @xcite :    @xmath83    in fig .",
    "[ fig : chargegap ] we plot the charge gap at @xmath74 for @xmath82 particles .",
    "the ground state of this particular system has a somewhat poorer overlap with the rr state than other system sizes , however the charge gap shows no such difference from other cases . along certain lines , indicated by arrows",
    ", the phase diagram reduces to one of the cases studied above .",
    "note that proper finite - size scaling needs to be performed in order to get the correct values for the gap ; however , it was previously found for filling factors @xmath84 and @xmath85  @xcite that this rigorous analysis produces values that are roughly in agreement with the ones shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chargegap ] . at @xmath74",
    "the number of available system sizes is too small to perform such an extrapolation reliably , and the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : chargegap ] should only be viewed qualitatively .",
    "we find a smooth transition between the hierarchy state and a stripe , with the gaps gradually dropping to zero for small @xmath77 . in the curved , narrow region around the transition",
    ", we previously found large overlaps with the rr state  @xcite .",
    "the excitation gaps in the transition region are much smaller than in the hierarchy phase , but they are nonetheless higher than at pure @xmath5 non - relativistic ll point ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 )",
    ". therefore , tuning the band structure does allow for a modest enhancement of the gap in the rr phase .",
    "qualitatively similar results are obtained for the neutral , instead of charge , gap .",
    "a larger variation of the gap can be achieved in the setup that utilizes the dielectric screening ( eq . [ eq : interaction_screened ] ) . in fig .",

    "in this paper we have explored the stability of @xmath0 rr state , the prime candidate for topological quantum computation , in the phase diagram as we tune the effective interaction via band structure parameters ( that depend on the chirality of the material ) , or via dielectric screening .",
    "numerical calculations suggest that the rr state is most stable in the vicinity of the bare @xmath5 non - relativistic ll coulomb potential , the same one which describes gaas materials .",
