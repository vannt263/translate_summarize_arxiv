    "unlike virtually all other astronomical objects , ly@xmath2 absorbing `` clouds '' were first discovered at great distances ( @xmath72 ) due to cosmological redshifts and the near - uv atmospheric cutoff .",
    "it has only been with the advent of the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) that nearby examples have been found and studied ( bahcall et  al .",
    "1991 , 1993 ; morris et  al .  1991",
    "; and subsequent hst qso absorption line key project papers by jannuzi et  al .",
    "1998 and weymann et  al . 1998 ) .",
    "while these absorbers are abundant enough to account for all baryons at @xmath72 , their still substantial numbers at @xmath80 imply that @xmath920% of all baryons remain in these clouds locally ( e.g. , shull , penton & stocke 1999a ; penton et  al .",
    "2000b ; dav et  al .",
    "1998 , 2000 ) .",
    "thus , any account of the present - day distribution of baryons must include an accurate census of these clouds and the mass associated with them , as inferred from their column densities and physical extent .    while the above baryon census is ample reason for studying the local ly@xmath2 forest in detail , it is also only at low-@xmath4 that ly@xmath2 absorber locations can be compared accurately with galaxy locations , so that the relationship between these `` clouds '' and galaxies can be determined .",
    "the degree to which absorbers correlate with galaxies has been controversial : lanzetta et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) and chen et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) argue that the absorbers are the extended halos of individual bright galaxies ( see also lin et al .",
    "2000 and linder 2000 ) , while others ( morris et  al .  1993 ; stocke et  al .",
    "1995 ; impey , petry & flint 1999 ; dav et  al .",
    "1999 ; penton et  al .",
    "2001a ) argue that the absorbers are related to galaxies only through their common association with large - scale gaseous filaments , arising from overdensities in the high - redshift universe .",
    "the intensity of this debate is evident in the differing views presented at the conference and in these proceedings .",
    "the results reported in this paper come chiefly from an on - going survey of the local ly@xmath2 `` forest '' , which utlilizes spectra like that shown in figure  1 , and which is being conducted by our group at colorado ( j.m .",
    "shull , s. penton , m. giroux & k. mclin ) , in collaboration with j. van gorkom ( columbia ) , c. carilli and j. hibbard ( nrao ) , and r.j .",
    "weymann and m. rauch ( ociw ) .",
    "current results on the physical conditions and metallicities of the absorbers in our sample can be found in the article by j.m .",
    "shull in this volume .",
    "since the time of the meeting , we have incorporated 16 additional sightlines into this analysis and have discovered a few more close ( @xmath10 kpc ) absorber - galaxy pairs in our on - going ground - based redshift survey program ( mclin et  al .",
    "neither of these new results significantly affects the conclusions we drew at the time of the meeting .",
    "surprisingly and luckily for local igm research , the modest hst aperture is competitive with the 10 m aperture of the _ keck _ telescope ( @xmath11hires spectrograph ) in detecting ly@xmath2 absorbers because much brighter targets can be observed .",
    "figure  1 shows an hst@xmath11stis ( space telescope imaging spectrograph ) far - uv spectrum of the bright bl lac object pks 2005 - 489 , which detects ly@xmath2 absorbers as low in column density , n@xmath12@xmath1 , as the best _ keck _ hires data ( e.g. , hu et  al . 1995 ) , but within 20,000 km  s@xmath13 of the earth .",
    "this allows us an unprecendented opportunity to search for faint galaxies that could be associated with these absorbers .",
    "all results reported here are based on data toward 15 targets studied with the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) ( penton et  al .",
    "2000a , b , 2001a ) and 16 targets observed using stis ( penton et  al .",
    "2001b ) . in the entire survey",
    ", we have detected 197 ly@xmath2 absorbers at @xmath14 significance over a total unobscured pathlength @xmath15 .",
    "this yields @xmath16200 per unit redshift at n@xmath1710@xmath18@xmath1 or one `` cloud '' every 20@xmath19 mpc .",
    "the 20% baryon fraction quoted above uses this line density , a 100@xmath19 kpc spherical cloud extent and the standard 10@xmath20ergss@xmath13 @xmath1hz@xmath13 sr@xmath13 local ionizing flux value ( shull et  al .",
    "to ensure that absorber - galaxy statistics are not biased due to incomplete galaxy survey information , we will quote results only for a subset of 86 absorbers that lie in regions of space surveyed for galaxies down to at least @xmath21 based upon the cfa redshift survey catalog ( huchra et al .",
    "1992 ) , february 8 , 2000 version and/or our own galaxy redshift survey work ( mclin et  al .",
    "preliminary results for a smaller group of 56 absorbers in regions surveyed down to 0.1@xmath21 also are presented .",
    "most of the results presented herein are described in detail for the ghrs sample in penton et  al .",
    "( 2001a ) .",
    "the two - point correlation function ( tpcf ) , which measures the clustering of local ly@xmath2 absorbers , is similar to that found at high-@xmath4 in that there is a 4@xmath22 excess power over random at @xmath23200 km s@xmath13 , but with no excess power at any larger @xmath24 .",
    "impey , petry & flint ( 1999 ) found a similar result using lower resolution spectra .",
    "the absence of significant clustering of these absorbers is strong evidence that ly@xmath2 clouds do not arise in galaxy halos .",
    "but some investigators ( see e.g. , fernandez - soto et  al . 1996 ) suggest that unresolved blends in ly@xmath2 absorption lines could cause us to underestimate the clustering of ly@xmath2 absorbers .",
    "however , the local galaxy halo tpcf has a large amount of excess power out to @xmath251000 km s@xmath13 as well as a signature of galaxy voids , neither of which are present in the ly@xmath2 tpcf ( penton et  al .",
    "also , observations with stis using the echelle gratings as well as ly@xmath26 observations with fuse ( shull et  al .",
    "2000 ) strongly suggest that there are at most 3 blended lines in each of our detected ly@xmath2 absorbers .",
    "additionally , our absorber sample is at such low-@xmath4 , that we can view the relationship between absorbers and galaxies directly , so that the tpcf is not as essential to understanding galaxy - absorber relationships as it is at high-@xmath4 .    using available bright galaxy redshift survey results and our own redshift survey work , we have searched for the nearest known galaxies to these absorbers and have found only a few close matches among the subset of 86 absorbers in sky regions surveyed down to at least @xmath21 , although the detected close galaxies are almost always well below @xmath21 in brightness .",
    "for example , 6 of the 8 galaxies within @xmath27 kpc of an absorber are more than 2 magnitudes fainter than @xmath21 and almost all of these are in the virgo cluster ( 6 of these same 8) , where the galaxy density is known to be much higher than elsewhere ( impey , petry & flint 1999 ) . for 11 virgo cluster absorptions , impey et  al .",
    "had found that the nearest - neighbor distances were so large that it was not possible to identify the absorber as a single galaxy halo .",
    "we find the same result : the median nearest galaxy neighbor distance from a ly@xmath2 absorber in the @xmath21 survey region sample is @xmath28 kpc , while the median nearest galaxy neighbor to another @xmath21 galaxy is @xmath29 kpc away in the same region ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "thus , even for galaxies as bright as @xmath21 it is problematical to identify a low column density absorber with a single galaxy .",
    "this and other features of the nearest neighbor distributions are shown in figure 2 , where the ly@xmath2 absorber sample has been split into two equal parts by number at 86 m . while the stronger absorbers follow the galaxy nearest - neighbor distances more closely than the weaker absorbers ( the two ly@xmath2 subsamples differ at the 4.5@xmath22 level ) , the stronger absorbers cluster",
    "much more weakly with galaxies than galaxies cluster with each other ( 5@xmath22 difference ) but the weaker absorbers are not randomly distributed relative to galaxies either ( 7@xmath22 difference ) .",
    "thus , even with a much larger and more uniformly surveyed sample , our current conclusions do not differ from our earlier work ( stocke et  al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "furthermore , for those few galaxies found close ( @xmath6300 km s@xmath13 in @xmath30 and at impact parameters @xmath31kpc on the sky ) to a local ly@xmath2 absorber , the distribution of locations is random in that volume ; i.e. , even the galaxies rather near to ly@xmath2 absorbers do * not * concentrate close to the absorber , as would be expected if they were physically associated .",
    "this is true both for the @xmath21 subsample ( penton et  al .",
    "2001a ) and for the 0.1@xmath21 sample ( mclin et  al . 2001 ) and suggests that even when there is a galaxy close to the absorber , the placement of the galaxy is random with respect to the absorber , as would be expected if there were no direct physical association between the two .",
    "sixteen percent ( 14 absorbers ) of these absorbers lie in well - defined galaxy voids , with no known galaxies within 2 - 5@xmath32mpc .",
    "deep optical and hi 21 cm observations still in progress have failed to locate any galaxies close to four of these `` void '' absorbers ( mclin et  al .",
    "2001 ; hibbard et  al .",
    "2001 ) down to impressively low limits due to their proximity to the earth ( @xmath33=2000 - 3000 km s@xmath13 ) .",
    "for the four nearest `` void absorbers '' , those in the mrk 421 , mrk 509 , vii zw 118 and he1029 - 140 sightlines , the cfa redshift survey catalog finds no @xmath34 galaxies within 2 - 5@xmath32mpc , while pencil - beam optical spectroscopy finds no very faint ( @xmath35 to @xmath36 ) galaxies within 100 - 250 @xmath32kpc of the absorber and hi observations with the vla finds no h i emitting object with @xmath37 present in a much larger region around three of these four absorbers ( he1029 - 140 has not yet been observed in h  i 21 cm emission ) .",
    "thus , the absence of galaxies in voids and near `` void absorbers '' is confirmed and the only detectable baryons in voids are the ly@xmath2 absorbers . by correcting for the somewhat variable sensitivity of our ly@xmath2 survey with redshift , we find that 22% of all absorbers are in voids and thus ( recalling that the full ly@xmath2 absorber density accounts for @xmath38 of all baryons locally ) , the baryon density in voids is only 4.5 ( @xmath61.5)% of the total mean baryon density of the universe determined by [ d / h ] ratio ; see penton et  al .",
    "( 2000b , 2001a ) for the detailed calculations of @xmath39 in ly@xmath2 absorbers .",
    "if ly@xmath2 absorbers have no bias factor , then the supercluster - to - void density ratio is at least 20:1 .",
    "the plots of the cumulative distribution of absorber nearest - neighbor galaxy distances and of equivalent width ( ew ) versus impact parameter ( @xmath40 ) for our full sample are similar to those published previously ( stocke et  al .",
    "1995 ) and to the results found by tripp , lu & savage ( 1998 ) and impey , petry & flint ( 1999 ) .",
    "the correlation between ew and @xmath40 contains all the salient features ( e.g. , lack of correlation at low - n@xmath5 ; we find no correlation whatsoever for our enlarged sample ) expected from the n - body+hydrodynamic simulations of dav et  al .",
    "dav et  al .",
    "interpret this plot as due to large - scale structure filaments ; i.e. , the correlation between ew and @xmath40 does * not * require either a physical or a causal association with individual galaxy halos as proposed by lanzetta et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) and chen et  al .",
    "our tpcf results and discovery of a substantial fraction of all absorbers in voids supports the dav et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) interpretation .",
    "thus , it seems that this plot can not be used to support the hypothesis that all ly@xmath2 absorbers are very extended galaxy halos , although we emphasize that our absorber sample and that of lanzetta et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) and chen et  al ( 1998 ) do not overlap significantly in equivalent width .    in one case , the sightline pair 3c273/q1230@xmath11011 , separated by 0.91@xmath41 on the sky , we have a preliminary indication that both the 7 absorbers and 9 known galaxies in this vicinity are aligned along a single ( @xmath42kpc ) , elongated ( @xmath433:1 ) filament at @xmath33=1000@xmath442000kms@xmath13 ( penton et  al .",
    "additionally , penton et  al .",
    "( 2001a ) find a strong indication that this particular set of absorbers is not unique in this respect ; i.e. , for our full absorber sample there is a strong ( 4 - 12@xmath22 ) statistical alignment of absorbers along galaxy filamentary structures .",
    "this alignment with filaments is in contrast to the absence of any alignment between absorber locations and galaxy major axes found by lanzetta et  al .",
    "eventually , perhaps with the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) on hst , we will be able to use ly@xmath2 absorbers and galaxy survey data ( e.g. , sloan digital sky survey ) to map out the full extent of large - scale structure filaments in the local universe .    for one case , a close grouping of ly@xmath2 absorbers at @xmath45 17,000kms@xmath13 in the direction of pks 2155 - 304",
    ", we have good metallicity limits ( shull et  al .",
    "1998 ) for low column density absorbers far from galaxies .",
    "deep optical galaxy survey work ( mclin et  al . 2001 ) has failed to find fainter galaxies closer to the absorbers than the h  i emitters found previously , the closest of which is @xmath46 kpc away on the sky .",
    "no metal lines ( c  iv and si  iii ) have been detected as yet in the several strong ly@xmath2 systems at this redshift , placing upper limits on the metallicity of these clouds of @xmath471% solar .",
    "this result is still preliminary , awaiting better h  i column density information from new hst ( stis ) and fuse spectra .",
    "so , while extensive metallicity surveys of ly@xmath2 absorbers have not yet been conducted with hst , it is possible that some clouds ( e.g. , the `` void absorbers '' ) are devoid of metals , setting significant `` fossil '' constraints on the spread of metals in the early universe due to supernovae winds and galaxy interactions ( see e.g. hui & gnedin , 1997 ) .",
    "however , we have found at least one absorber that is undetected in c  iv , c  iii and c  ii but has strong o  vi absorption ( tripp et  al . , 2001 ) , so that any metallicity result based only on lower ionization species alone must be taken with caution .",
    "the existence of this one ly@xmath2 @xmath11 o vi absorber is additional evidence for shock - heated `` clouds '' ( see tripp contribution to this volume ) .",
    "however , we caution that virtually all o  vi absorbers ( i.e. , chen & ostriker s `` hot - warm '' phase ) should be detectable in ly@xmath2 and so should be present in our ghrs+stis survey ; i.e. , it is important not to `` double count '' absorbers when determining the total baryon content of the local ly@xmath2 `` forest '' !",
    "for the uninitiated viewing the debate on the relationship between ly@xmath2 absorbers and galaxies at the pasadena conference , one must ask whether the issue is primarily semantics or science . on the one hand , at this conference ken lanzetta and hsiao - wen chen argued that all higher column density absorbers are individual , spherical galaxy halos with a nearly unity covering factor to ly@xmath2 absorption out to impact parameters of @xmath48 kpc . in this paper",
    "i have presented evidence that the majority of lower column density absorbers are associated , not with individual galaxies , but with large - scale filamentary structures in which both the galaxies and the absorbers are imbedded .",
    "this is the view espoused by the cosmic simulators , who find these very extensive gaseous structures throughout their simulations at both high- and low-@xmath4 . at the extremes ,",
    "it is clear that both views are correct : there are certainly some higher column density absorbers that must be extended galaxy halos because they are so close to their `` parent '' galaxy ( @xmath49 kpc ; e.g. the mg  ii absorbers ) as to be bound to it , while there are low column density absorbers demonstrably * not * associated with galaxies at all because they are in voids . in between , the data could argue for either stance and the differences might be largely semantic , excepting for the issue of metallicity .",
    "if by galaxy `` halo '' we mean gas that was once within the galaxy and then was expelled to large radii , the local ly@xmath2 absorbers should contain gas with metallicities of @xmath9 0.1 solar .",
    "there is preliminary evidence that this is the case for absorbers within @xmath25100 kpc of the nearest bright galaxy ( chen et  al .",
    "2001 ; stocke et  al . in preparation ) but not for the bulk of the forest which lies at much larger distances from bright galaxies ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "metallicities for some of these more representative clouds are needed to be more definitive about the origin of gas in the local ly@xmath2 absorbers , including the `` void absorbers '' .",
    "if the bulk of the forest is `` primeval '' , then the observations can be used to test the simulations ; but if , these absorbers are mainly the product of latter - day galaxy winds , then detailed `` microphysics '' must be included in the simulations to match the observational record .",
    "focus on the issue of metallicity may allow workers in this field to stick to scientific rather than semantical concerns .",
    "we acknowledge the financial support at the university of colorado of grants provided through hst go programs # 6593 , # 8182 and # 8125 , and nasa theory grant nag5 - 7262 .",
    "i thank all of my collaborators listed in the introduction for their efforts contributing to these results , especially steve penton and mike shull for the ly@xmath2 absorber analysis , ray weymann for the faint galaxy redshift survey work and john hibbard and jacqueline van gorkom for the h i work at the vla .",
