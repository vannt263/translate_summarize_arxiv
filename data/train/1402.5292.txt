    "hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and molecular hydrogen , h@xmath0 , is the dominant molecule in all astrophysical environments , from the atmospheres of giant ( exo)planets to external galaxies .",
    "molecular hydrogen is also used in many industrial applications , and is often discussed as a potential energy carrier for the future . in particular , low - temperature hydrogen plasmas are relevant for many technological plasma applications including fusion . in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , where stars and planets form , h@xmath0 is produced efficiently _ via _ the recombination of hydrogen atoms on the surface of sub - micron size dust grains @xcite . in the early universe , where dust grains were absent ,",
    "the dominant source of h@xmath0 was the associative detachment between h and h@xmath8 and , at high density , the three body recombination h+h+h @xcite .",
    "molecular hydrogen is a major contributor to the physics and chemistry of astrophysical media and , in particular , it played a fundamental role in the cooling of the gas clouds that gave birth to the very first stars .",
    "owing to its identical hydrogen nuclei ( with nuclear spin 1/2 ) , h@xmath0 exists in ortho ( o - h@xmath0 ) and para ( p - h@xmath0 ) forms , also called nuclear - spin isomers . in the electronic ground state ,",
    "the rotational levels of o - h@xmath0 have odd values of the angular momentum @xmath9 while the levels of p - h@xmath0 have even @xmath9 values .",
    "the internal energy of the newly formed h@xmath0 molecules is expected to depend on the specific formation mechanism but it is generally assumed that h@xmath0 is initially highly excited .",
    "the ortho - to - para ratio ( opr ) of nascent h@xmath0 is therefore usually taken as its limiting ( high temperature ) statistical value of 3 , which is the ratio of the degeneracies of the ortho ( @xmath10=1 ) and para ( @xmath11 ) nuclear spin states .",
    "the opr of h@xmath0 formed on cold ( @xmath1250  k ) solid surfaces was studied in several recent experiments and the measured values were indeed found to be consistent with the high temperature limit of 3 ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in other processes , the conservation of the total nuclear spin plays a crucial role and , for instance , in the dissociative recombination of h@xmath4 with electrons , the opr of the product h@xmath0 molecules depends on the opr of the reactant h@xmath4 molecules ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    in an isolated state ,",
    "the ( radiative ) interconversion between the ortho and para states of h@xmath0 is extremely slow , the theoretical time scale being @xmath13  s @xcite , i.e. greater than the age of the universe .",
    "ortho - to - para conversion ( opc ) ( also referred as nuclear spin conversion ) is also forbidden in non - reactive inelastic collisions . as a result",
    ", the opc can only occur in the gas phase _ via _",
    "`` spin exchange '' ( reactive ) collisions and in the solid phase _ via _ interaction with surfaces of magnetic or diamagnetic materials , including amorphous water ice @xcite . in both laboratory and space environments ,",
    "the opr of h@xmath0 is however not necessarily at thermal equilibrium because the timescale of the opc process can be significantly longer than the timescale of the thermal evolution ( and also than the thermalization time within each modification ) .",
    "thus , the h@xmath0 opr measurements reported in the astronomical literature often show values out of equilibrium with the environment temperature , e.g. in planetary atmospheres @xcite or in protostellar shocks @xcite where the values typically vary from 1 to 3 .",
    "the opr value therefore provides a valuable probe of the thermal history and lifetime of the observed astronomical object . in cold interstellar clouds , where h@xmath0 is invisible",
    ", the opr is expected to decrease slowly with temperature ( from its initial value of 3 ) but to remain higher than the thermal equilibrium value ( @xmath14 at 10  k ) @xcite .",
    "indirect evidences based on the observation of deuterated molecules ( see @xcite and references therein ) and ammonia @xcite indeed suggest opr values of @xmath710@xmath15 . this has important consequences because the opr of h@xmath0 not only affects the interstellar chemistry but also the molecular excitation ( see e.g. @xcite ) and therefore the cooling by molecular line emission .    in astronomical environments ,",
    "the opc rate on solid surfaces is highly uncertain because it strongly depends on poorly known parameters such as the electronic structure of the surface , the residence time of h@xmath0 , the conversion efficiency , etc . @xcite . in the gas phase",
    ", the conversion can occur through spin - scrambling reactions between h@xmath0 and the most abundant hydrogenated species h , h@xmath1 , h@xmath0 and h@xmath4 . the relative contribution of each colliding partner depends on its relative density and on the kinetic temperature . indeed , because the reactions of h@xmath0 with h and h@xmath0 have substantial barriers ( @xmath7 5000  k and @xmath7 60 000  k , respectively ) , the opc in the cold ism ( i.e. @xmath16 ) is driven by proton exchange with h@xmath1 and h@xmath4 . in warmer regions ( @xmath17  k ) , however , reactive collisions with h become efficient .",
    "examples are shock - heated gas , photon dominated regions ( pdrs ) , supernova remnants , and the primordial gas .",
    "finally , in planetary atmospheres where the h@xmath0 density is much larger than in the ism ( @xmath18  cm@xmath15 ) , h@xmath0+h@xmath0 collisions can play an important role despite very low rate coefficients @xcite .    in the present work , we review recent theoretical work on the opc of h@xmath0 by hydrogen and proton exchange in the gas phase .",
    "these two reactions , h+h@xmath0 and h@xmath1+h@xmath0 ( and their isotopic analogs ) , have become prototypes for triatomic reactions and because of their experimental and theoretical accessibility , they have have been studied in much detail , allowing a very accurate understanding of the dynamics .",
    "surprisingly , however , the specific opc process has not been the object of many theoretical investigations in the past .",
    "very recently , it has been revisited using full dimensional quantum time - independent approaches combined with high accuracy ab initio potential energy surfaces ( pes ) for h@xmath3 @xcite and h@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "these triatomic systems are indeed amenable to state - of - the - art computational methods and various measurements have confirmed that theory and experiment have now converged for such elementary reactions , as discussed below .",
    "in contrast , only approximate theoretical methods have been applied so far to the four- and five - atom systems h@xmath0+h@xmath0 and h@xmath4+h@xmath0 . for these important processes ,",
    "we refer the reader to other recent sources .",
    "thus , for the opc of h@xmath0 by h@xmath0 , theoretical and experimental results are discussed in @xcite . for the opc of h@xmath0 by h@xmath4 ,",
    "the interested reader can find detailed information on the various recent experimental and theoretical works in @xcite and references therein . finally ,",
    "for the conversion on solid surface , we refer the reader to the very recent review by fukutani & sugimoto @xcite .",

    "iv , astrophysical applications are discussed .",
    "concluding remarks are drawn in sec .",
    "the computation of reactive rate constants usually takes place within the born - oppenheimer approximation for the separation of electronic and nuclear motions .",
    "reactive cross sections are thus obtained by solving the motion of the nuclei on an electronic pes , which is independent of the masses and spins of the nuclei .",
    "the pes must be accurate since the dynamical calculations are very sensitive to the pes quality .",
    "the most accurate treatments to compute pes are those based on modern methods of _ ab initio _ quantum chemistry @xcite .",
    "the process of reactive collision between a diatomic molecule and an atom requires generally , for the pes calculation , the use of _ ab initio _ methods based on configuration interaction ( ci ) .",
    "ci methods like multireference internally contracted configuration - interaction ( mrci ) method @xcite , which is currently the most accurate method , is generally used to describe all geometries that could be explored by the nuclei during the collisional process .    for light triatomic reactive systems like",
    "the h+h@xmath0 and h@xmath1+h@xmath0 systems , full configuration interaction ( fci ) method @xcite which provides numerically exact solutions ( within the atomic basis set ) can also be used .",
    "this approach is very cpu consuming but can provide a very accurate description of the correlation energy as long as large atomic basis set are used .    for heavier systems or with many degrees of freedom ,",
    "multiconfigurational second - order perturbation theory ( caspt2 ) methods @xcite can alternatively be used in order to keep reasonable cpu time without altering too much the accuracy of the pes .",
    "finally , for reactive systems whose wave function can be reasonably well described by a single determinant wave function , coupled - cluster theory @xcite can also provide an accurate estimate of the pes .",
    "however , reactive systems are rarely monoconfigurational systems and such approach can not generally be used .    in the methods described above ,",
    "the quality of the result is also determined by the choice of atomic orbitals to describe the molecular orbitals and the electronic configuration .",
    "the chosen atomic orbitals basis set , from which are built the molecular orbitals , must be large enough to correctly represent the correlation energy and not too extended so that the computation time remains acceptable .",
    "the augmented correlation - consistent valence quadruple zeta ( aug - cc - pvqz ) or quintuple zeta ( aug - cc - pv5z ) basis sets of dunning and co - corkers  @xcite are usually well adapted to interaction pes calculations . in order to get accurate results with respect to the atomic basis set",
    ", the energies obtained with the incomplete basis set can be extrapolated to the complete basis set ( cbs ) limit , employing for example the mixed exponential and gaussian formula @xcite : @xmath20 , where @xmath21 denotes the size of the smaller basis and @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are adjustable fitting parameters .",
    "the standard quantum chemistry methods described above are implemented in several widely used numerical codes ( molpro @xcite , gaussian @xcite or molcas @xcite )    then , an additional important step related to the interaction pes determination is the building of its analytic representation in order to adequately perform the dynamical calculations .",
    "great care should be taken in order to maintain the accuracy of the _ ab initio _ pes in its analytical representation through elaborate fitting techniques .",
    "fitting methods such as the reproducing kernel hilbert space ( rkhs ) method @xcite or the double many - body expansion ( dmbe ) @xcite theory are generally used to obtain the analytic representations .    generally , the long range values derived from the _ ab initio _ calculations are not very accurate as they result from the ( small ) difference of two large numbers .",
    "one should keep in mind the importance of carefully extending the analytical pes values to the long range part which can be more precisely derived from perturbation calculations as a @xmath25 expansion , where @xmath26 represents the distance between the centers of charge of the two interacting systems .",
    "the long range part is then described by the electrostatic , induction and dispersion terms contributing to the total interaction energy of the complex with the proper angular and radial dependences @xcite .",
    "small unphysical irregularities of magnitude @xmath27 1 @xmath28 at long range can significantly affect the dynamical calculations .",
    "these effects are even more crucial in the field of cold and ultra - cold collisions .",
    "the h@xmath3 system considered in the present review can be viewed as a prototype of small polyatomic systems .",
    "the corresponding pes has been extensively studied .",
    "the first fully _ ab initio _ pes was published in 1978 .",
    "truhlar & horowitz @xcite made an accurate least - squares fit to liu and siegbahns calculations @xcite of the pes for the h+h@xmath0 reaction .",
    "approximately a decade later , two refined versions of the h@xmath3 pes , called dmbe @xcite and bkmp @xcite have been published . finally , the most recent calculations by boothroyd et al . @xcite and mielke et al .",
    "@xcite have been widely used both for h+h@xmath0 inelastic and reactive collisions , including the isotopic variants .",

    "global pess of the three lowest electronic singlet states of h@xmath4 have been built from the diatomics - in - molecule approach @xcite or using the dmbe method @xcite .",
    "recently , an updated version @xcite of the _ ab initio _ pes of aguado et al .",
    "@xcite has been published . in the following section ,",
    "the results on h@xmath1+h@xmath0 have been obtained on this pes .",
    "we therefore recall the main features of this high quality _ ab initio _ pes . compared to the previous version published in 2000",
    ", new refinements have been indeed added in the present pes , such as more _ ab initio _ points and the inclusion of a functional form of the long - range electrostatic interaction in the analytical representation .",
    "this last point is crucial to compute accurate scattering attributes at low temperature .",
    "in addition , the pes is invariant under all permutations of the nuclei and presents a deep well ( 4.6 ev relative to the h@xmath1+h@xmath0 asymptote ) and no barrier in the entrance channel .",
    "all approaches are therefore possible and both abstraction and insertion mechanisms can occur . in 2013 , quantum mechanical and approximate dynamical calculations have been performed on this pes for the study of the d@xmath1 + h@xmath0 reaction @xcite .",
    "the comparison between the quantum - mechanical rate constant and the measurements showed an excellent agreement as illustrated in fig .",

    "once the pes has been determined , the reactive cross sections and rate constants are derived from the solution of the nuclear schr \" odinger equation within a given pes .",
    "several approaches can be used to determine the reactive cross sections and rate constants . the most widely used approach for reaction dealing with the h@xmath3 and",
    "h@xmath4 systems are quantum time dependent and time independent methods .",
    "indeed , the large ro - vibrational energy level spacings of h@xmath0 make this system well suited for quantum scattering calculations .",
    "nevertheless , it is well known that the wave packet method may not be very accurate at low collision energies that characterize the ism because of difficulties in damping outgoing waves with long de broglie wavelengths . a quantum time independent treatment seems to be the most reasonable and accurate choice for such studies .",
    "the computation of reactive cross sections is generally performed by using methods based on a time - independent quantum formalism , called ",
    "close - coupling \" ( cc ) .",
    "the quantal formalism has been introduced by arthurs and dalgarno @xcite for inelastic collisions and then extended to reactive collisions by schatz & kuppermann @xcite .    the three - dimensional time independent quantum mechanical reactive scattering calculations usually employ a method based on body - frame democratic hyperspherical coordinates @xcite to represent the nuclear wave function . in the present work",
    ", the abc code @xcite and an alternative hyperspherical method @xcite have been used to study respectively the dynamics of h+h@xmath0 and that of the h@xmath1+h@xmath0 reaction .",
    "an additional problem that is encountered when dealing with the h@xmath3 and h@xmath4 systems is that these are composed by three identical nuclei that are indistinguishable .",
    "contrary to what is usually the case for other reactive systems , the entrance and exit channel can not be distinguished .",
    "h@xmath3 and h@xmath4",
    "systems therefore belong to the @xmath31 nuclear permutation symmetry group and the nuclear wave function , nuclear spin excluded , belong to the @xmath32 a@xmath0 or e irreducible representation .",
    "the specific symmetry properties of the nuclear wave function can be incorporated in a simple manner , through an appropriate choice of the hyperspherical harmonics that are built from products of simple analytical functions @xcite .    when the three - particule system under considerations has @xmath31 permutation symmetry , the nuclear spin of the identical particles must be taken into account .",
    "the total nuclear wave function can be written as a direct product of the spatial wave function which satisfies the spin - independent schrdinger equation and a nuclear spin wave function . for bosons ,",
    "the total nuclear wave function is symmetric , whereas , for fermions , it is antisymmetric with respect to interchange of the identical nuclei . accordingly , for the h+h@xmath33 h+h@xmath34 and h@xmath1+h@xmath35 h@xmath1+h@xmath36 reactions , the physically observable integral cross sections , @xmath37 that obey the proper spin statistics , can be derived by weighting the calculated integral cross sections @xcite :",
    "@xmath38    it is worth mentioning that , if a full quantum method is used to treat the dynamics of three identical nuclei , as in the present work , the reactive and inelastic scattering processes can not be distinguished .",
    "alternatively , cross sections may be calculated from wavefunctions which treat the protons as distinguishable by appropriately adding scattering amplitudes for inelastic ( e.g. , @xmath39 ) and reactive ( e. g. , @xmath40 or @xmath41 ) processes obtained from such wavefunctions @xcite . in a full description of the collision , the states in the h+h@xmath0 or h@xmath1+h@xmath0 arrangement are described by the quantum numbers @xmath9 and @xmath42 ( the rotational angular momentum of the h@xmath0 molecule and its projection along the reactant jacobi vector ) , and @xmath43 ( the vibrational quantum number of the h@xmath0 molecule ) . the integral cross section for collision of h or h@xmath1 with h@xmath0(@xmath44 ) to give h+h@xmath0(@xmath45 ) or h@xmath1+h@xmath0(@xmath45 ) , summed over final projection quantum numbers and averaged over initial projection quantum numbers , is given by :    @xmath46    where @xmath47 denotes the initial wavevector and where the @xmath48-matrix for the h+h@xmath0 or h@xmath1+h@xmath0 reaction are given by :     @xmath49    @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the nonreactive and reactive @xmath48-matrix elements , respectively .",
    "the summation in eq .",
    "[ equ : cross_section ] extends over all values of the total angular momentum @xmath52 which contribute to the reactive or inelastic process .",
    "the scattering calculations are carried out on a grid of values of the total energy @xmath53 .",
    "the relevant independent variable for the cross sections is , however , the collision energy @xmath54 , which is the initial translational energy .",
    "the two are related by @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the ro - vibrational energy of the h@xmath0 reactant .    from the calculated cross sections",
    "@xmath57 , one can obtain the corresponding thermal rate coefficients at temperature @xmath58 by performing a maxwell - boltzmann average over the collision energy ( @xmath54 ) : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the reduced mass of the reactive system and @xmath61 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "note that the quantum mechanical study of the h@xmath1+h@xmath0 reaction is more difficult than that of abstraction reactions , such as the h+h@xmath0 reaction also presented in this review , for two principal reasons .",
    "as already mentioned in the previous section the corresponding pes has a deep well and thus many states have to be taken into account in the close - coupling equations .",
    "moreover , in a such complex forming reaction , symmetric top configurations ( where the coriolis coupling is large ) are energetically accessible .",
    "all ( or nearly all ) the allowed @xmath62 components ( where @xmath62 is the projection of the total angular momentum @xmath52 on the axis of least inertia ) have to be taken into account in the close - coupling expansion states , in order to obtain accurate cross sections .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath52 , @xmath63 , depends on the maximum of the collision energy employed in the scattering calculations .",
    "for the complex - forming h@xmath1 + h@xmath0 reaction detailed below , the maximum value of the collision energy is 0.1  ev . in this case ,",
    "@xmath64 and @xmath62 varying from 0 to 25 are enough for convergence of integral cross sections . by comparison , converged integral reactive cross sections have been obtained for the h + h@xmath0 reaction up to 1  ev by using @xmath65 and restricting the projection quantum number of @xmath52 to 6 only .",
    "quantum mechanical calculations using the hyperspherical method described above are therefore very consuming in cpu time and in memory .",
    "however , in contrast with the isotopic variant d@xmath1+h@xmath0 @xcite where the same pes is used , the h@xmath1+h@xmath0 system offers a great advantage , the three identical nuclei which noticeably reduce the cpu time .",
    "the abc code and the post - symmetrisation given by eq .  2 have been used to study the h + h@xmath0 reaction , while the other tiqm approach has been used to study the h@xmath1 + h@xmath0 reaction by considering the three nuclei as undistinguishable .",
    "recently , we checked the two methods gave similar results on the h + h@xmath0 reaction @xcite .",
    "we showed the equivalence between results obtained by the post - symmetrisation of the s - matrix elements computed using the abc code and results obtained from s - matrix elements with the correct exchange symmetry ( using the other tiqm approach ) .",
    "we should also mentioned that calculations of the reactive rate constants can be done using quasi - classical trajectory ( qct ) method @xcite .",
    "the qct method combines the use of classical mechanics , to treat the scattering process , but the quantization of the reactants is taken into account .",
    "quantization is simulated by means of a  binning \" procedure , which involves allocating the final states to discrete values of the corresponding quantum numbers .",
    "however , the qct method is only valid as long as the classical mechanics that underpins it . for low temperatures collisions ( as those found in the ism )",
    ", the qct approach seems to be not very appropriate because the inability of qct treatments to conserve the vibrational zero - point energy can render this method unreliable near reaction thresholds .",
    "accurate statistical methods based on a pure quantum mechanical formalism , such as the statistical quantum mechanical ( sqm ) method @xcite , can also be used for the study of complex forming reactions such as the h@xmath1+h@xmath0 reaction .",
    "an example of such calculations is given in the next section .",
    "surprisingly , despite its crucial importance for the physical chemistry of early universe and of the ism but also for the physical chemistry of hydrogen plasmas , the opc process of h@xmath0 due to h collisions has not been the object of many theoretical or experimental investigations . indeed , in most of the rotationally inelastic excitation studies of h@xmath0 by h , the rigid rotor approximation was used and therefore , the reactive channels were neglected @xcite . the goal of these studies was the calculation of rotationally inelastic rate coefficients for astrophysical applications at low to moderate temperatures ( below 1000 k ) .",
    "rigid rotor approach could be justified since the reaction between h and h@xmath0 is inhibited by a large barrier ( @xmath27 5000 k ) , and the reactive rate constants corresponding to opc of h@xmath0 are expected to be very small at these temperatures .    the opc process of h@xmath0 by hydrogen exchange has been already studied by truhlar @xcite , mandy & martin @xcite and by sun & dalgarno @xcite . the most recent work of sun & dalgarno @xcite , despite relatively accurate , was restricted to p - h@xmath66 and o - h@xmath67 and was then too limited for astrophysical applications of , for example , early universe .",
    "experimentally , the para ",

    ". the crossing occurs at an energy of 2.7 ev with respect to the bottom of the h@xmath0 ground electronic states well . as a consequence ,",
    "there is a sign change of the electronic wavefunction as one follows a closed path in nuclear configuration space around the line of the conical intersection .",
    "this sign change is usually referred as the geometric phase effect which can be globally taken into account at low energies ( e @xmath12 15000  @xmath28 ) by reversing the sign of the @xmath51 @xcite matrices using the theoretical approach which treat the protons as distinguishable .",

    "@xcite    apart from the geometric phase effects , non - adiabatic transitions in the region of proximity of the two electronic surfaces are also possible ( at high collision energies ) . however , for these systems , it has been found that non - adiabatic transitions are unlikely to occur @xcite .",

    "as discussed in the introduction , molecular hydrogen is the most abundant molecule in the universe and its opr plays a fundamental role in both the physics and chemistry of the ism and of the early universe . in this section",
    "we discuss the relative role of the different opc processes , that is _ via _ reactive collisions with hydrogenated species ( h , h@xmath1 , h@xmath0 , h@xmath4 ) and _ via _ interaction with solid surfaces . in the cold ism ( @xmath74 ) , only h@xmath1 , h@xmath4 and",
    "the icy dust grains can contribute to the opc of h@xmath0 because of the large energy barriers to hydrogen exchange in h+h@xmath0 ( @xmath5  k @xcite ) and h@xmath0+h@xmath0 ( @xmath760 000  k @xcite ) . in the gas phase ,",
    "conversion by protons and h@xmath4 have similar rate coefficients of @xmath75  @xmath76s@xmath73 for the @xmath16 ortho - para transition in the temperature range 10@xmath2100  k ( see fig .  7 and @xcite ) . in typical cold molecular clouds ,",
    "the h@xmath0 density is @xmath710@xmath77  cm@xmath15 and the relative abundances of h@xmath1 and h@xmath4 ( relative to h@xmath0 ) are both a few 10@xmath78 .",
    "these two ions therefore contribute with similar opc rates of @xmath79  s@xmath73 and the timescale for the gas phase opc in these objects is @xmath80  myr , which is close to the typical lifetime of molecular clouds ( @xmath81  myr @xcite ) . as a result , the opr of h@xmath0 in the cold ism is expected to be close to its steady - state value , which should however differ from the thermal equilibrium value @xcite .    in warmer regions such as protostellar shocks or pdrs , the kinetic temperature can exceed 300  k and in this regime collisions with hydrogen atoms become efficient with an opc rate coefficient larger than @xmath82  @xmath76s@xmath73 ( see fig .",
    "if the abundance ratio between h and h@xmath1 ( or h@xmath4 ) is larger than @xmath83 ( assuming a typical opc rate coefficient of @xmath84  @xmath76s@xmath73 for protons above 100  k ) , hydrogen atoms will then compete or even dominate the ions in the opc of h@xmath0 in these environments . at temperatures above @xmath7600  k , the rate coefficient for the conversion of p - h@xmath0 to o - h@xmath0 even exceeds @xmath85  @xmath76s@xmath73 ( fig .",
    "4 ) . in media where the abundance ratio [ h ] / [ h@xmath1 ] is larger than @xmath87",
    ", hydrogen atoms will be thus the major para - to - ortho converters with an opc rate of @xmath88  @xmath89  yr , where @xmath90 is the density of hydrogen atoms .",
    "thus , if @xmath90 is larger than @xmath91  cm@xmath15 , the para - to - ortho conversion by h can yield an equilibrium opr of 3 within less than 30 000  yr ( at kinetic temperatures above 600  k ) .",
    "we note that we do not consider here h@xmath0+h@xmath0 collisions because these have a negligible opc rate coefficient of @xmath92  @xmath76s@xmath73 at 300  k @xcite .",
    "these collisions can however play a role in the atmospheres of giant ( exo)planets owing to h@xmath0 densities much higher than in the ism .",
    "if we now consider typical dust grains with size @xmath93 m , a dust - to - gas ratio of @xmath94 by number and a h@xmath0 mean velocity of @xmath95  cm.s@xmath73 , the typical collision rate between h@xmath0 and a dust grain is a few 10@xmath96  s@xmath73 at 10  k. using a typical sticking probability of 0.1 @xcite and a solid phase opc efficiency of 1 , the overall opc rate is @xmath79  s@xmath73 , i.e. similar to the gas phase opc rate in the cold gas .",
    "dust grains can thus possibly play a role in the opc of h@xmath0 , in competition with gas phase processes .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the opc efficiency on solid surfaces can be much lower than 1 , depending on the ratio between the residence time ( which is highly uncertain ) and the conversion time ( which is typically 10@xmath97  s on amorphous water and graphite ) @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "nascent h@xmath0 molecules formed on a grain could be immediately retrapped in the very irregular surface of amorphous solid water @xcite .",
    "the opr of such retrapped h@xmath0 could then reflect the temperature of the surface . in summary , in contrast to the opc of h@xmath0 by h and h@xmath1 for which rate coefficients are now known with high accuracy , the contribution of dust particles is unclear and more experimental work on interstellar dust analogues is urgently needed .",
    "dedicated astrophysical models including all relevant processes , such as @xcite , are also necessary to assess the impact of the new calculated rate coefficients .    finally , in addition to ortho - para conversion , hydrogen atoms and protons are important colliders than can also rotationally excite h@xmath0 molecules , in competition with other h@xmath0 molecules and he atoms ( and electrons in highly ionized media ) .",
    "thus , from data reported in tables  1 - 3 , we can compare the rate coefficients for ortho - ortho and para - para transitions ( @xmath69 ) with those computed for h@xmath0+he and h@xmath0+h@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "above 300  k , these latter are similar to those for h@xmath0+h so that all the dominant neutrals ( h , he and h@xmath0 ) significantly contribute to the pure rotational excitation of h@xmath0 . at low temperature ( @xmath98  k ) where data for proton exchange are available , the rate coefficients for the transitions @xmath99 and @xmath100 are 3 - 4 orders of magnitude larger for protons than for neutrals .",
    "the contribution of protons in the rotational excitation of h@xmath0 ( @xmath69 ) is therefore significant if their relative abundance ( with respect to the dominant neutral ) exceeds @xmath101 , e.g. in the early universe @xcite .",
    "we have attempted to review the recent achievements related to the gas phase ortho ",
    "para conversion of h@xmath0 in astrophysical media . despite these new data",
    "already improve significantly the modeling of this process in interstellar media and early universe , there is still a lack of data for high temperatures and for high ro - vibrational levels , including for pure ro - vibrational excitation .",
    "extrapolation to higher ( lower ) temperatures is addressed for example in ref .",
    "@xcite where specific analytic extrapolation formulae are suggested .",
    "the danger of extrapolation is however emphasized by flower and pineau des forts @xcite for a number of molecules including h@xmath0 and we endorse these warnings on an even larger scale .",
    "thus , it seems important to extend the present calculations in order to provide the astronomers the necessary tools to model the ro - vibrational excitation and ortho  para - h@xmath0 conversion processes in hot environments .",
    "such extension should be feasible for the ortho  para - h@xmath0 conversion by hydrogen exchange since the calculations are relatively fast in terms of cpu time . at the opposite , for ortho ",
    "para - h@xmath0 conversion by proton exchange , an extension to higher temperature may be more difficult since it will imply to deal with a huge number of coupled channels using the quantum time independent approach .",
    "statistical method may be then an interesting alternative since quantum and statistical approach are generally in good agreement for this system .",
