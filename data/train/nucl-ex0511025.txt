    "the nucleon elastic electromagnetic form factors are fundamental quantities needed for an understanding of the nucleon s electromagnetic structure .",
    "the sachs electric , @xmath8 , and magnetic , @xmath9 , form factors @xcite , defined in terms of linear combinations of the dirac and pauli form factors , are of particular physical interest , as their evolution with @xmath3 , the square of the four - momentum transfer , is related to the spatial distribution of charge and current within the nucleon . as such , precise measurements of these form factors over a wide range of @xmath3 are needed for a quantitative understanding of the electromagnetic structure not only of the nucleon , but also of nuclei ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "further , in the low - energy regime of the nucleon ground state , the underlying theory of the strong interaction , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , can not be solved perturbatively , and a proper description of even the static properties of the nucleon , the lowest stable mass excitation of the qcd vacuum , in terms of the qcd quark and gluon degrees of freedom still stands as one of the outstanding challenges of hadronic physics .",
    "indeed , one of the most stringent tests to which non - perturbative qcd ( as formulated on the lattice or in a model of confinement ) can be subjected is the requirement that the theory reproduce experimental data on the nucleon form factors ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    because of the lack of a free neutron target",
    ", the neutron form factors are known with less precision than are the proton form factors , and measurements have been restricted to smaller ranges of @xmath3 .",
    "a precise measurement of the neutron electric form factor , @xmath6 , has proven to be especially elusive as the neutron s integral charge is zero .",
    "prior to the realization of experimental techniques utilizing polarization degrees of freedom , values for @xmath6 were extracted from measurements of the unpolarized quasielastic @xmath1h@xmath10h cross section and the deuteron elastic structure function @xmath11 . those results for @xmath6 deduced from measurements of the quasielastic @xmath1h@xmath10h cross section provided little information on @xmath6 , as all results were consistent with zero over all ranges of @xmath3 accessed , @xmath12 ( gev/@xmath4)@xmath1 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , results for @xmath6 deduced from measurements of @xmath11 , although establishing @xmath13 for @xmath14 ( gev/@xmath4)@xmath1 , were plagued with large theoretical uncertainties ( @xmath15% ) related to the choice of an appropriate @xmath16-potential for the deuteron wavefunction ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    with the advent of high duty - factor polarized electron beam facilities and",
    "state - of - the - art polarized nuclear targets and recoil nucleon polarimeters , experimental efforts over the past 15 years have now yielded the first precise determinations of @xmath6 .",
    "our experiment @xcite was designed to extract the neutron electric to magnetic form factor ratio , @xmath0 , from measurements of the neutron s recoil polarization in quasielastic @xmath1h@xmath2h kinematics at three @xmath3 values of 0.45 , 1.13 , and 1.45 ( gev/@xmath4)@xmath1 .",

    "an extraction of the neutron form factor ratio , @xmath0 , from measurements of the neutron s recoil polarization in quasielastic @xmath1h@xmath2h scattering is , however , complicated by nuclear physics effects , such as final - state interactions ( fsi ) , meson exchange currents ( mec ) , isobar configurations ( ic ) , and the structure of the deuteron .",
    "the pioneering study of the sensitivity of the quasielastic @xmath1h@xmath2h reaction to the neutron form factors , reported by arenhvel @xcite , revealed that for perfect quasifree emission of the neutron ( i.e. , neutron emission along the three - momentum transfer @xmath59 ) , @xmath38 is proportional to @xmath6 , but is relatively insensitive to fsi , mec , ic , and the choice of the @xmath16-potential for the deuteron wavefunction .",

    "spin vectors were transported through the field using the same magnetic spin transport algorithms developed for our two simulation programs .",
    "this technique provided a measure of the sensitivity of the precession angle to details of the field map .",
    "the uncertainties in the mean values of the precession angles derived from these studies ( at the level of @xmath76 ) were combined in quadrature with two other sources of uncertainty .",
    "first , as discussed in section [ sec : neutron - polarimeter - charybdis ] , we observed small differences between the measured field integrals for opposite magnet polarities and also between the field integrals derived from our measured maps and the calculated ` tosca ` maps .",
    "these uncertainties were estimated to be on the level of @xmath77 .",
    "second , as also discussed in section [ sec : neutron - polarimeter - charybdis ] , the field was mapped only along the central axis ; therefore , we assigned further uncertainties ( at the level of @xmath76 ) for incomplete knowledge of the field beyond the central axis .",
    "our best estimates of the total uncertainties in the precession angle were then propagated through the form factor ratio , eq.([eq : phase - shift - delta ] ) .",
    "radiative corrections were calculated specifically for the kinematics of this experiment by afanasev _",

    "the primary effect of radiative corrections on the recoil polarization components @xmath38 and @xmath39 was found to be depolarization of the electron such that both components of the recoil polarization should be increased by @xmath78% , @xmath79% , and @xmath80% at @xmath81 , 1.132 , and 1.450 ( gev/@xmath4)@xmath1 , respectively ; however , these corrections nearly cancel in the form factor ratio such that the net effect is small at @xmath81 ( gev/@xmath4)@xmath1 and negligible at the two higher @xmath3 points . the residual non - cancellations of the corrections in the form factor ratio were taken to be the systematic uncertainties we quote in table [ tab : systematic - uncertainties ] .",
    "the timing calibrations we deemed suitable for certain running conditions ( e.g. , periods in between changes to the high - voltages for the pmts ) were obtained using a subset of the data for that particular running period . to assess the dependence of our results for the scattering asymmetries on the choice of the subset of data employed for the timing calibration , various calibrations were generated from different subsets of the available data .",
    "excellent agreement was always found between the results for the scattering asymmetries obtained from analyses using these different calibrations ; however , we did find a @xmath82% sensitivity of our results to the choice of the subset of data employed for the timing calibration .",
    "we deemed two other possible sources of systematic uncertainties to be negligible .",
    "first , we demonstrated quantitatively that our scattering asymmetries were insensitive ( within statistical errors ) to a possible geometric asymmetry in the polarimeter ( i.e. , a spin - averaged `` top - bottom '' asymmetry ) by varying our software energy thresholds on the top ( bottom ) rear array while maintaining a constant threshold on the bottom ( top ) rear array .",
    "second , analysis of our data taken with the `` dummy targets '' ( see section [ sec : scattering - chamber - cryotargets ] ) showed that the level of contamination within our @xmath83 $ ] ns ctof window from scattering in the target cell windows was negligible ( @xmath84% ) .       at @xmath87 , 1.132 , and 1.450 ( gev/@xmath4)@xmath1 extracted from the various analyses summarized in table [ tab : summary - final - results ] .",

    "we note that in our first publication @xcite we used values for @xmath91 taken from @xcite ; here we use slightly different values for @xmath91 taken from @xcite .",
    "the total systematic errors we quote for @xmath6 are the quadrature sum of the experimental sytematic errors and the relative uncertainties in @xmath91 .",
    "the availability of precise new data on nucleon form factors has stimulated much more theoretical work in the last few years than we can review here ; our selection of models is not intended to be complete .",

    "models based upon vector meson dominance ( vmd ) postulate that the virtual photon couples either directly to an intrinsic nucleon core or through the mediation of a neutral vector meson , initially limited to the lowest @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 mesons .",
    "the earliest versions assumed that the core is a structureless dirac particle .",
    "et al_.  @xcite assigned the core a form factor and employed a model of the @xmath95 width .",
    "gari and krmpelmann @xcite then permitted different dirac and pauli intrinsic form factors and introduced modifications that ensured consistency with pqcd scaling at large @xmath97 and logarithmic running of the strong coupling constant .",
    "bijker and iachello @xcite adopted the gari and krmpelmann ( gk ) pqcd prescriptions and refit their model to modern data , still using a common intrinsic form factor .",
    "this fit , using a total of 6 free parameters , is compared with the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : vmd ] .",
    "finally , lomon @xcite produced a more flexible set of fits using a model described as `` gk extended '' ; the gkex(02s ) version is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vmd ] .",
    "the lomon model uses two intrinsic form factors , the gk prescription for the pqcd limit , and includes @xmath98 and @xmath99 couplings in addition to the customary @xmath95 , @xmath94 , and @xmath96 couplings .",

    "does it reproduce the slope in @xmath105 for @xmath106 ( gev/@xmath4)@xmath104 . both of these features are fit well by the lomon model .",
    "unfortunately , the neutron data do not discriminate between these models very strongly .",
    "the bijker and iachello model provides a slightly better fit to the present @xmath6 data , but the lomon fit was performed before these data became available ; it is likely that only a slight parameter adjustment would be needed to achieve a comparable fit without sacrificing the fits to other form factors .",
    "it will be interesting to see whether the rather large values for @xmath107 for @xmath108 ( gev/@xmath4)@xmath104 predicted by the bijker and iachello model are confirmed by upcoming experiments @xcite that will probe @xmath6 to @xmath109 ( gev/@xmath4)@xmath1 .",
    "note , however , that the bijker and iachello fit is systematically above the @xmath91 data for the same kinematics , @xmath108 ( gev/@xmath4)@xmath104 .",
    "the role of the pion in mediation of the long - range nucleon - nucleon interaction clearly demonstrates its importance in understanding form factors for low @xmath97 .",
    "typical pion cloud models describe nucleon form factors using diagrams in which the virtual photon couples to either a bare nucleon core or to the nucleon or the pion loop in a single - pion loop .",
    "some models also permit excitation of the intermediate state and include additional contact terms .",
    "a relatively simple example is the adelaide version @xcite of the cloudy bag model ( cbm ) in which the core is based upon the bag model , intermediate excitation is neglected , and relativistic corrections are made using a simple ansatz for lorentz contraction @xcite .",
    "predictions from lu _",
    "et al_.  @xcite using a bag radius of 0.8 fm are compared with the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : pion ] .",
    "although density - dependent extensions of this model , described as the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model , have been used to study the sensitivity of recoil polarization in nucleon electromagnetic knockout to medium modifications of the nucleon form factors @xcite , its description of free form factors is rather poor and one must hope that the density dependence of @xmath48 ratios is more accurate .    alternatively , the light front cloudy bag model ( lfcbm ) of miller @xcite maintains poincar invariance by formulating wave functions using the light - front approach .",
    "this version should then be applicable to higher @xmath97 .",
    "there are only 4 adjustable parameters and the results for set 1 are compared with data in fig.[fig : pion ] .",
    "a previous version of this model @xcite provided one of the earliest predictions of the sharp slope in @xmath56 for @xmath110 ( gev/@xmath4)@xmath104 , but the agreement with recent recoil - polarization data is only qualitative .",
    "the lfcbm calculation for @xmath111 also decreases too rapidly at large @xmath97 .",
    "calculations using this model agree relatively well with the @xmath6 data for @xmath112 ( gev/@xmath4)@xmath104 but are too small at lower @xmath97 .",
    "interestingly , this model predicts much stronger values for @xmath107 at large @xmath97 than the lomon parametrization .",
    "however , the lfcbm calculations for three of the four form factors show complicated and rather implausible shapes for @xmath113 ( gev/@xmath4)@xmath104 that disagree strongly with data .",
    "chiral effective field theory @xcite provides a more systematic procedure that includes intermediate excitation and can be extended to two pion loops @xcite .",
    "alternatively , two - loop contributions can be evaluated in dispersion theory @xcite .",
    "recently it has become possible also to include both pion loops and vector meson diagrams in a consistent manner @xcite ; however , we do not show curves here because this approach remains limited to @xmath114 ( gev/@xmath4)@xmath104 .",
    "friedrich and walcher @xcite performed a phenomenological analysis of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors using a parametrization motivated by pion cloud models .",
    "the core form factor is represented by two dipole form factors with different ranges while the pion cloud contribution , represented as a `` bump '' at low @xmath97 , is described by two gaussians .",

    "further , other sources of uncertainty , such as radiative corrections and neutron depolarization by lead shielding , are small as they nearly cancel in the ratio .    to account for the finite experimental acceptance and nuclear physics effects ( i.e. , fsi , mec , and ic ) , we used two independent simulation programs to average theoretical @xmath1h@xmath2h recoil polarization calculations computed according to the model of arenhvel _",
    "et al_.  @xcite over the acceptance .",
    "the results from these two simulation programs agreed to better than 1% at our two lower @xmath3 points and 2% at our highest @xmath3 point .",
    "further , by averaging two different sets of theoretical calculations assuming different parametrizations for @xmath6 , our acceptance - averaged and nuclear physics corrected values for @xmath6 were found to be insensitive to the choice of the @xmath3 dependence of @xmath6 .",
    "our results for @xmath6 and data on the nucleon form factors were compared with selected theoretical model calculations .",
    "all of the model calculations based upon vector meson dominance and those emphasizing the pion cloud presented here provide qualitative agreement with some of the four nucleon form factors , but no model achieves simultaneous agreement with all four form factors .",
    "the predictions of several recent relativistic quark models also achieve qualitative agreement with the data , with the most successful models utilizing form factors for the constituents ; the results from a chosen model assuming pointlike constituents are not as successful .",
    "although a comparison between data and the results of lattice qcd calculations is probably premature , the recent precise data obtained from experiments employing polarization degrees of freedom will no doubt serve as a future challenging test of qcd as formulated on the lattice .    in conclusion , our results at @xmath146 and 1.45 ( gev/@xmath4)@xmath1 are the first direct measurements of @xmath6 using polarization degrees of freedom in the @xmath147 ( gev/@xmath4)@xmath1 region and are the most precise determinations of @xmath6 over all ranges of @xmath3 .",
    "the achievement of relative statistical uncertainties in the form factor ratio @xmath0 of 8.4% and 9.5% , respectively , at these two @xmath3 points , together with relative systematic uncertainties on the level of 2% , was a triumph for our high figure - of - merit and high luminosity neutron polarimeter .",
