    "<S> in all known superconductors the pairing of fermions is not sensitive to the sign of their time - argument difference , leading to a cooper pair wavefunction that is even in time / frequency . </S>",
    "<S> four decades ago it was suggested that odd - frequency superconductivity should in principle be realizable . </S>",
    "<S> however , observation of odd - frequency superconductivity in bulk materials has remained elusive . solving the field - dependent anisotropic eliashberg equations , we present _ ab initio _ evidence for the emergence of odd - frequency pairing under an applied magnetic field in the archetypal superconductor mgb@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we provide the full momentum , frequency and spin resolved dependence and magnetic field - temperature phase diagrams of the even and odd - frequency superconducting pair amplitudes and predict fingerprints of the odd - frequency state in tunnelling experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> 0.7 cm    the pair amplitude of the two fermions forming the cooper pair has to obey the pauli exclusion principle , which implies that it has to be odd under particle exchange . </S>",
    "<S> it is commonly assumed that the pair amplitude is invariant , that is , even , with respect to the sign of the fermionic time - argument difference , which leads to the standard classification of cooper pair wavefunctions in terms of their symmetry under spatial and spin rotation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was however pointed out by berezinskii @xcite that the anti - symmetry of the pair amplitude can be fulfilled equally well when it is odd in time / frequency . </S>",
    "<S> after odd - frequency sc , which can not be described within bcs theory , was first proposed for @xmath1he @xcite it has since then been invoked in several occasions , including disordered fermi liquids @xcite , high - t@xmath2 compounds @xcite , heavy fermions @xcite and hydrates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> odd - frequency sc was also predicted to occur at superconductor to ferromagnet or to normal metal interfaces where the spatial symmetry is broken @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , in spite of active research and the important ramifications for our understanding of superconductivity unequivocal observation of these exotic states remains elusive @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , it was not until recently that the stability of bulk odd - frequency states was theoretically established @xcite , thus opening up the possibility of experimental observations . among all potential states , odd - frequency s - wave spin triplet ( ost ) </S>",
    "<S> sc @xcite appears as the most robust since it can endure pair breaking by static non - magnetic impurities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , in a bulk material , ost sc can not prevail over the even - frequency counterpart unless an extremely strongly coupled and retarded electron - phonon ( ep ) interaction is at play @xcite . until a material that fulfills these conditions </S>",
    "<S> is found , a promising alternative route is to look for special cases in which odd - frequency pairing could be possible @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the most plausible situation arises when an even frequency s - wave spin singlet ( ess ) superconductor is placed in an external magnetic field , since the breaking of time - reversal symmetry is then expected to induce an ost sc component @xcite .    despite recent progress , a fully microscopic , material - specific theory that supports the reality of ost sc is missing . </S>",
    "<S> we have extended the anisotropic eliashberg framework to include the effect of an external magnetic field , allowing for ost sc as a selfconsistent solution , and show here the unambiguous existence of ost sc in the two - band superconductor mgb@xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> the two - band superconductor mgb@xmath0 ( t@xmath2=39k ) @xcite is an ideal candidate to study the magnetic field induced ost sc . </S>",
    "<S> mgb@xmath0 is described thoroughly by _ ab initio _ </S>",
    "<S> methods @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> its fermi surface consists of sheets with primarily @xmath3 or @xmath4 orbital character @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> high frequency in - plane boron modes lead to an enhanced , very anisotropic ep coupling that mediates the pairing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> near the center of the brillouin zone ( bz ) where these modes soften , the ep coupling well exceeds @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( see also supplementary ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for some regions in momentum space , the ep interaction in mgb@xmath0 becomes both strongly retarded and coupled , satisfying the conditions for odd - frequency pairing . due to the inherent anisotropy , sc in mgb@xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> is characterized by a very anisotropic s - wave , two - gap structure ( @xmath6=2.8mev and @xmath7=7mev ) @xcite which can be explained with unprecedented precision by fully anisotropic eliashberg theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our _ ab initio _ </S>",
    "<S> results for zero field completely confirm the previous calculations , which emphasizes the accuracy of our selfconsistent solutions for finite magnetic fields .        in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] we show the calculated magnetic field  temperature phase diagram for the ess and ost superconducting components . for h@xmath80 , </S>",
    "<S> the ost sc appears and coexists with the ess sc in the same h  </S>",
    "<S> t regime where the latter is non - zero . </S>",
    "<S> the h  </S>",
    "<S> t dependence of the ess sc follows that of a pauli limited superconductor ; it goes to zero monotonously via a second order phase transition with temperature , except for a very narrow region near the upper critical field ( h@xmath9 ) , where the transition becomes first order . </S>",
    "<S> the transition to the normal state with the field changes from first to second order above t@xmath1026k . </S>",
    "<S> our solutions provide the first _ ab initio _ </S>",
    "<S> prediction for the paramagnetic limiting field of mgb@xmath0 ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) when orbital effects are neglected . </S>",
    "<S> we find h@xmath9=119 t , which is significantly less than previous estimations ( @xmath11 t ) @xcite . at low temperatures , </S>",
    "<S> the two ess sc gaps remain almost constant up to h@xmath12 t , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this is the lowest field strength needed to overcome the binding energy of the cooper pairs originating from the @xmath3-band . </S>",
    "<S> increasing the field further , leads to partial destruction of the latter gap and the concomitant decrease of the @xmath4 gap , due to the strong interband ep coupling in this material .    </S>",
    "<S> the ost component behaves similar to the ess as concerns the order of the transitions to the normal state and its temperature evolution . </S>",
    "<S> however , it exhibits a distinctively different magnetic field dependence ; it follows a re - entrant behaviour with the field , as is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . the trend becomes clearer at higher temperature where the re - entrance peak moves away from h@xmath9 . from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] one can observe that there exists , up to h@xmath1039 t , a linear dependence of ost sc on the magnetic field irrespective of the band index . </S>",
    "<S> notably , the ost sc also has a two - gap structure but the pairing is much weaker than the respective ess .        </S>",
    "<S> next , we examine the fermi surface momentum dependence of the sc gaps , presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . since in the eliashberg framework the superconducting gap retains its full frequency dependence ( cf .  </S>",
    "<S> figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , ) , it is more meaningful to define a superconducting gap edge , instead . in the zero - field case </S>",
    "<S> this is given by : @xmath13 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , here the zeeman effect lifts the degeneracy between spin @xmath14 quasiparticles . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> external probes see a superconducting gap edge that is effectively split in two . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the presence of the ost sc further modifies the gap edge . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant expressions can be found from the poles in the system s green s functions at the fermi level : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the order parameter for ess ( ost ) sc and @xmath17 is the renormalized magnetic field term that includes selfenergy contributions ( see supplementary ) . in the above , </S>",
    "<S> all quantities are real and the ost spins are perpendicular to h. we define an effective gap edge for each sc component as : @xmath18 .    since the real part of the ost order parameter vanishes at @xmath19=0 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ) , the gap edge of a pure odd - frequency superconductor should be zero </S>",
    "<S> . however , due to the presence of the ess sc and the magnetic field , this is finite in our case . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] we show the full momentum dependence of the spin-@xmath20 ess gap edge over the fermi surface of mgb@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the 3d tubular networks are due to the @xmath3-bands , while the almost two dimensional cylinders are due to the @xmath4-bands @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the two - gap structure is similar to the zero - field case @xcite but the momentum anisotropy differs . for the @xmath3-bands we find gap values between @xmath21 mev , which are close to the zero - field values , while for the @xmath4-bands we find gap values between @xmath22 mev and thus an enhanced anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] shows the difference between the spin - split gap edges of the ess component . remarkably , the splitting is more efficient for the @xmath4-bands where the gap edge is larger .    as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , the ost sc gap edge is very anisotropic and at h=40 t it is two orders of magnitude smaller than the respective ess . comparing figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] and [ fig2 ] we find that @xmath23 is proportional to the difference of the ess gap edges for the two spin components . </S>",
    "<S> this finding directly evidences that the ost superfluid density is proportional to the number density of spin flipped carriers that participate in the ess cooper pairs . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the ost is subordinate to the ess sc .        from the spectral function of our system , </S>",
    "<S> we have derived the quasiparticle dos in the superconducting state , @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity is proportional to the differential conductance measured in tunnelling experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - resolved quasiparticle dos reads @xmath25^{\\frac{1}{2 } } } \\bigg\\rangle_{{\\ ! </S>",
    "<S> \\bf k}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the dos at the fermi level in the normal state and @xmath27 denotes fermi surface averaging . </S>",
    "<S> using our selfconsistent data in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ qpdos ] ) we calculate the magnetic field evolution of the tunnelling spectra at low temperature , shown in fig .  [ fig3 ] . for h=0 </S>",
    "<S> we find two peaks around 3mev and 7mev that signal the quasiparticle excitations above the @xmath3 and the @xmath4 gaps , respectively @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also obtain the recently observed fine momentum structure of the latter gap @xcite . as the field increases , the peaks begin to split due to the spin degeneracy lifting . </S>",
    "<S> this is clearly visible already at 10 t for the @xmath3 peak , while at 20 t the splitting in both peaks should be very clearly resolved . </S>",
    "<S> the gap starts to close around 39 t where the magnetic field strength is comparable to the minimum gap edge value on the @xmath3-bands .    </S>",
    "<S> the odd - frequency component is finite for finite field and increases linearly with @xmath19 in the low frequency regime ( cf .  </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one would generally expect the ost gap to manifest as a shift of the tunnelling peaks for finite @xmath19 , to higher ( lower ) @xmath19 due to destructive ( constructive ) interference with the dominant ess gap . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to the smallness of the ost gap , these effects are practically washed out by the dominant ess component except for two regions . </S>",
    "<S> the first is for fields near 39 t , just before the @xmath3 gap begins to close . </S>",
    "<S> there , the ost gap reduces the magnetic field threshold of the zero energy peak by 0.5 t . </S>",
    "<S> the second is at frequencies near the @xmath4-band peak , where the ost component shifts the peak to the right . for 40 t </S>",
    "<S> the calculated peak shift is around 100@xmath28ev and increases with the field as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we now focus on the zero bias regime , @xmath19=0 . </S>",
    "<S> this case is of special interest , since all lifetime effects coming from the ep and the zeeman interaction are absent . </S>",
    "<S> the real part of the induced ost gap is also zero ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ) but the situation differs from that in a pure ost superconductor since here the ess component provides a robust gap at the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> hence , no low lying excitations should be expected at low temperatures and small , comparing to the @xmath3 gap , magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> this is certainly true for h=0 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ qpdos ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , when the field is turned on , the imaginary part of the ost component , @xmath29 , becomes finite ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this term effectively contributes an additional lifetime broadening to the quasiparticles and remarkably enforces a nonzero result in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ qpdos ] ) even at @xmath19=0 . if the ost is not included in the theory , the latter is ideally zero . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a zero - bias signal in the single - particle tunnelling appears due to the induced ost superconducting component . </S>",
    "<S> this signal has a distinct magnetic field dependence , as is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this zero - bias plateaux is even more pronounced for t@xmath304.2k where the ost sc is more favored ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we propose that a measurement of the zero - bias tunnelling under magnetic fields less than @xmath1039 t and at low temperatures would serve as definite proof for the identification of odd - frequency sc in mgb@xmath0 and in any superconductor that supports this kind of state .    </S>",
    "<S> our precise quantitative results predict the existence of ost sc in mgb@xmath0 , provide an in - depth insight into the microscopic nature of this exotic state and pave the way for the ultimate experimental identification of odd - frequency sc . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , our approach initiates a novel _ ab initio _ </S>",
    "<S>  roadmap \" for the search of such exotic magnetic - field - induced phenomena relevant for both bulk and interface physics @xcite . </S>"
