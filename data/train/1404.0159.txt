    "quantum walks , in which the walker s position on the graph can be a superposition and the decision process is simulated by a ` quantum coin ' such as the hadamard transformation , show a surprisingly different behaviour to classical random walks .",
    "quantum walks have been formulated as discrete @xcite or continuous @xcite walks , and led to new versions such as the semi - classical stochastic quantum walk @xcite or the open quantum walk @xcite .",

    "an important implication is that neural networks based on a step activation function do manipulate information irreversibly due to its injectivity , i.e. a state of a neural network at timestep @xmath56 can not be reconstructed from its state at timestep @xmath57 .",

    "the genius of the hopfield model lies in the fact that operations on the neuron as a local unit impose dynamics on the global network state .",
    "these global dynamics can be understood as a classical random walk between network states , @xmath67 beginning with the initial pattern and in each step jumping to the updated network state .",
    "after a finite number of steps , the chain reproduces the stable state serving as the output of the algorithm .",
    "+ likewise , a quantum walk on the firing states of a qnn can be defined as an evolution @xmath68 following the laws of quantum mechanics .",
    "an important question is the structure of the graph underlying such a quantum walk .",
    "the vertices of the graph are given by binary strings denoting all possible firing patterns .",
    "the connectivity thus depends on the updating protocol .",
    "if all neurons are updated synchronously , each transition between firing patterns is theoretically possible and the graph is fully connected .",

    "this small difference leads to a problem in the implementation of the quantum walk proposed here , since the coin ( eq .",

    "we want to propose another type of quantum walk that is not derived from the neural updating mechanism , but still obtains the hopfield network s dynamics of associative memory . hence , our goal is to introduce a stochastic quantum walk on a hypercube graph that ends up in one of two ` attracting firing states ' closer to the initial state in terms of hamming distance .",
