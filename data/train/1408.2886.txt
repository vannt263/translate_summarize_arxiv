    "of 1873 0.1100gev sources in the second _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) catalog , over 1170 had statistically reliable lower energy counterparts @xcite .",
    "most are blazars and spin - powered pulsars ( radio - selected and geminga - like @xmath8-ray selected ) .",
    "@xcite noted that the identification completeness of the brightest 250 lat sources was even higher with ( at that time ) no more than six remaining unidentified and showed that variability and gev spectral curvature classification flagged all six as having pulsar - like properties .",
    "three of these sources have since been identified as millisecond pulsar ( msp ) binaries with strong winds : j2339@xmath10533 , a `` redback '' ( romani & shaw 2011 ; kong et al .",
    "2012 ) , j1311@xmath13430 , a `` black widow '' ( romani 2012 ; pletsch et al .",
    "2013 ) , and j1227@xmath14859 , a low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb)/msp transition object ( ray et al . 2014 ) . here",
    "we report evidence that a fourth member of this set , 2fgl  j1653.6@xmath10159 ( hereafter j1653 ) , is also a msp - driven evaporating binary .",
    "j1653 is located at galactic latitude @xmath9 , with a total galactic extinction @xmath10mag at this position @xcite . with a @xmath11 detection significance in 2fgl ,",
    "an energy flux of @xmath12 , a `` variability index '' value of 17 , and a `` curvature significance '' of 5.3 , this is a steady source with a substantial spectral cutoff : a prime pulsar candidate .",
    "it has been searched for @xmath13hz @xmath8-ray pulsations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and for radio pulses to millisecond periods @xcite , with no detection .",
    "thus , it is unlikely to be an isolated young pulsar or a persistent radio - loud msp .",
    "we describe here an optical campaign to identify and characterize a counterpart .",
    "j1653 is well localized ; we used the the goodman high throughput spectrograph ( ghts ) at the 4.2 m soar telescope on 2013 august 1012 ( ut dates are used throughout ) to image the @xmath14 radius lat error ellipse and examine low energy counterparts .",
    "conditions varied from poor ( @xmath15 ) to wretched ( @xmath16 ) , and so the ghts data were binned @xmath17 . our strategy ( as used to identify j1311 and j2339 ) was to obtain initial 300s @xmath18 frames for near - simultaneous colors ( aug .",
    "10 ) , followed by single - color photometric sequences : @xmath19s in @xmath20 ( aug .",
    "10 ) , @xmath21s in @xmath22 ( aug .",
    "11 ) , and @xmath23s in @xmath24 ( aug .",
    "we were particularly interested in the eight _ chandra _ x - ray sources in the revised error ellipse ( see cheung et al .",
    "four of these had optical counterparts in our frames .",
    "the brightest x - ray source had a blue optical counterpart showing evident variability during the first hour s observation and was thus the prime target of the light - curve study .",
    "the usno - b1.0 position of this @xmath25mag optical source ( and likely lat counterpart ) is @xmath26 , @xmath27 ( j2000.0 ) .",
    "although many frames had limiting magnitudes as small as @xmath28 , this star was easily detected in all observations ; we made sure to cover at least one maximum during each night s photometry .",
    "this counterpart was also observed in gunn @xmath29 ( 180s ) and narrow - band h@xmath30 ( 600s ) with the minimo camera at the 3.6 m wiyn telescope on 2012 february 19 .",
    "the narrow - band image did not yield a reliable magnitude , but the @xmath29-band frame could be calibrated to sdss @xmath22 , and matched well to the soar light curve at the phase determined for the best - fit period ( see below ) .",
    "we searched image archives for exposures that may have included j1653 , finding useful coverage in the catalina sky survey ( css ; http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/css/index.html ; drake et al .",
    "these data are shallow , unfiltered , and sparse , but they show significant modulation at the orbital period . using the soar , wiyn , and css points , we searched the folded light curves for the minimum phase dispersion with the iraf phase dispersion minimum ( pdm ; stellingwerf 1978 ) script .",
    "this is @xmath31d , with epoch @xmath32 ( mjd ) .",
    "aliases appear at @xmath33d and @xmath34d , but these provided less satisfactory light curves .",
    "the @xmath35 uncertainty estimate in the last two digits comes from the range of the main minimum with a pdm statistic @xmath36 lower than that of the best sidelobe minimum .",
    "the folded light curves ( two periods ) are shown in figure 1 .",
    "this period , 4488s = 1.25h , is shorter than that of any known rotation - powered pulsar binary .    for pulsar - heated companions ,",
    "we expect the counterpart to be hottest ( bluest ) at maximum brightness . guided by simple sinusoids",
    ", one sees that while @xmath37 does decrease slightly at the peak ( @xmath38 ) , @xmath39 throughout the orbit .",
    "also , the minimum is flat and the system is bluest in this region ; at the light curve minimum another component dominates the light from unheated secondary .",
    "the relatively poor photometry prevents any detection of inter - orbit variability .",
    "7.9truecm    -0.7truecm",
    "we attempted initial spectroscopy with the ghts and 400linemm@xmath4 grating on 2013 august 11 ( mjd 56515 ) , covering 35007000  at 7  resolution . with some of the best seeing of the run ( @xmath40 )",
    ", we maintained reasonable throughput with a fixed 1.07@xmath41 slit .",
    "three 600s spectral exposures were obtained and subjected to standard calibrations , using exposures of the spectrophotometric standard eg  274 .",
    "these data exhibited no strong emission lines , indicating that this was not a disk - dominated binary , and they showed a faint secondary spectrum .",
    "cross - correlation against stellar templates revealed velocity shifts , but the low signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) and substantial velocity smearing gave large radial - velocity uncertainties .",
    "to explore the radial - velocity variations , we obtained two exposure sequences with the keck 10 m telescopes .",
    "first , using the deep imaging multi - object spectrograph ( deimos ; faber et al .",
    "2003 ) on keck - ii ( 2013 september 10 , mjd 56545 ) we obtained @xmath42s exposure covering 44509060  with @xmath43  resolution through a @xmath44 slit .",
    "the short exposures minimized velocity smearing , and the sequence covered a full orbit .",
    "these data suggested a large radial - velocity variation , but had low s / n and lacked blue coverage .",
    "we also observed with the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; oke et al .",
    "1995 ) on keck - i on 2014 may 01 ( mjd 56778 ) , using the @xmath44 long - slit and the 5600  dichroic splitter . in the blue camera",
    "the 600/4000 grism provided coverage to @xmath45  at @xmath46  resolution , while the red camera employed the 400/8500 grating at @xmath47  resolution .",
    "red - side and blue - side exposures were 270s and 330s ( respectively ) , and a sequence of seven exposures covered optical maximum .",
    "observations of the spectrophotometric standards hd  84937 and feige  34 and the radial - velocity standard hd  151288 were used in standard iraf reductions , including optimal extraction . again",
    ", good evidence for radial - velocity variations was apparent , but here the spectra lacked full orbital coverage .    to complete our spectroscopic study",
    ", we conducted a second campaign with keck - i / lris , with the same spectroscopic configuration on 2014 may 24 ( mjd 56802 ) .",
    "for both lris campaigns we set the slit at pa = + 20@xmath48 to include a star of comparable brightness @xmath49 south - southwest . monitoring this g - type field star and the night - sky lines allowed us to confirm the stability of the radial - velocity solution and to connect photometry and velocity measurements between the observing runs . in this run",
    "we obtained a sequence of @xmath50s exposures with the red camera , binned a factor of 2 in the spatial direction to minimize the readout time .",
    "the blue camera was run unbinned , and exposure times were adjusted ( 250285s , typically 265s ) to keep the exposure midpoints approximately aligned with those of the red camera .",
    "these observations covered three orbits ; we also obtained exposures of spectrophotometric standards and the g / k radial - velocity standards hd  122120 , hd  125184 , and hd  125455 .    a failure of the blue camera shutter early in the sequence allowed counts to accrue during readout , adding up to @xmath47% continuum contamination at 5500 , less to the blue . using a blue standard observed before shutter failure and cross - calibrating with the field star ( referenced to the 2014 may 01 average spectrum ) , we developed a stable spectrophotometric solution . the red camera was not affected .",
    "residual mis - match across the dichroic wavelength suggests that the absolute spectrophotometry for @xmath51 has an additional @xmath52% uncertainty beyond the usual variable slit losses .",
    "our study of the orbital variations starts with a comparison of spectra at maximum brightness ( `` day '' ; @xmath53 ; 14 exposures ) and minimum brightness ( `` night '' ; @xmath54 ; 13 exposures ) .",
    "figure 2 shows average spectra from these windows , doppler shifted to the rest frame according to the best radial - velocity solution ( see below ) . although the true extinction is not well known , we have dereddened using the full galactic @xmath55mag , consistent with the x - ray spectrum (  4 ) .",
    "`` night '' is dominated by a nearly power - law component ( @xmath56 ) ; the step at @xmath57  likely represents residual flux - calibration uncertainties . with a lower @xmath58mag ,",
    "the spectrum fits somewhat less well as a power law with index @xmath59 .",
    "the maximum - light `` day '' spectrum includes a thermal excess ( diff ) , plotted along with main - sequence k5 ( @xmath60k ) and f2 ( @xmath61k ) comparison spectra .",
    "the thermal excess is broader than a stellar spectrum , evidently from the range of @xmath62 over the heated `` day '' face of the companion star .",
    "low - s / n difference spectra at quadrature ( `` dawn '' and `` dusk '' ) give lower effective temperatures .",
    "the `` dusk '' thermal excess appears brighter and hotter than that during `` dawn , '' but this is presently of low significance ; such asymmetry can be explored using simultaneous multi - color photometry .",
    "7.8truecm    -0.7truecm    the `` night '' spectrum shows no spectral features ; we find equivalent - width limits @xmath63for kinematic line width below @xmath64 .",
    "the nature of this blue emission is unclear .",
    "in contrast , the `` day '' spectrum exhibits many broad and narrow absorptions matching standard stellar spectral features .",
    "a number of the strongest metal lines can be individually identified in the `` day '' average .",
    "hydrogen balmer lines are not detected . comparing with sdss normal - star spectra , we find equivalent - width limits of h@xmath30 , h@xmath65 , and h@xmath8 to respectively be @xmath66 , 0.11 , 0.14   in the `` day '' spectrum versus 1.04 , 0.66 , 1.16  ( k5  v ) and 3.17 , 4.15 , 2.69  ( f2",
    "the equivalent widths should , however , be measured for the thermal component of the spectrum ; the limits for the lower - s / n difference spectrum are @xmath67  for all three species .",
    "thus , h is weaker than in normal stars by a factor of 210 in this diff spectrum , depending on which @xmath62 dominates the `` day''-side excess .",
    "while less impressive than for psr j1311@xmath13430 , whose strongly heated face shows a limit [ h ] @xmath68 of normal , it appears that this companion may have also lost appreciable hydrogen .",
    "we do not detect individual he  i lines , but this is not surprising for the @xmath62 range seen here .",
    "na  i @xmath695892 is , as for psr j1311@xmath13430 , very strong compared to the comparison stars .",
    "we can use the line features on the heated face to estimate the companion radial velocity .",
    "the measurements were made via cross - correlation , using the iraf xcaso script @xcite .",
    "we used the wavelength range 350010,000  after excising regions near strong night - sky lines and the immediate vicinity of the dichroic transition .",
    "the bulk of the correlation significance stems from the metal line features at 40005500 , but significant and consistent correlation signal was also measurable in the red portions of the spectra .",
    "a range of stellar templates was used .",
    "while significant correlations and similar @xmath70 were obtained using early - m through f templates , the best correlations were obtained with k - type spectra .",
    "we report here the results for a k5  v template . monitoring the night - sky lines during each campaign and comparing the radial - velocity fits to the comparison field star between keck campaigns showed that our wavelength solutions are stable to 0.1  @xmath71kms@xmath4 .",
    "correlations against the radial - velocity standards imply a similar accuracy for the absolute @xmath70 .",
    "the cross - correlation significance is monitored via the @xmath72 statistic . for the may 24 data ,",
    "the individual spectra near optical maximum had @xmath7310 with radial - velocity accuracies @xmath7420kms@xmath4 .",
    "near quadrature the accuracies dropped to @xmath75kms@xmath4 . since `` night''-side spectra lack stellar features , the cross - correlation showed low significance with @xmath76 .",
    "although we do find similar `` night '' velocities at a given phase from the various observing runs , there is little systematic velocity trend and essentially all the correlations are of low significance .",
    "this suggests that the `` night '' phase velocities , even when they show modest statistical errors , are generally not meaningful .",
    "9.2truecm    -0.7truecm    the cross - correlation velocities from our four spectroscopic campaigns are shown in figure 3 , phased to the photometric ephemeris . over the phase range @xmath77 ,",
    "the velocity errors are small and , with a few outliers , the measurements from the various instruments are in good agreement .",
    "we performed a weighted least - squares fit to the measurements with @xmath78 in this phase range .",
    "two 2014 may 24 lris points , at @xmath79 with @xmath80 and @xmath81 with @xmath82 , lay several sigma from all best - fit curves . excluding these points",
    ", the fit uses the measurements marked with a black central dot in figure 3 and results in a secondary velocity amplitude @xmath83kms@xmath4 and mean velocity @xmath84kms@xmath4 with a fairly good @xmath85/dof = 1.75 .",
    "inclusion of the two dropped points decreases @xmath86 by 1.3@xmath87 and @xmath85/dof grows to 2.52 .",
    "note that several low significance points in the range @xmath88 also lie @xmath89kms@xmath4 redward of the best - fit curves .",
    "this , plus the light - curve asymmetry and bluer spectrum at this phase , suggest some heating / wind activity in the `` dusk '' region , which may perturb the photospheric radial velocities .",
    "similar , but dramatically stronger effects are seen for j1311@xmath13430 @xcite .",
    "our measured @xmath77 radial velocities follow the center of light of the secondary star , weighted by a k5  v spectrum .",
    "the resulting mass function , @xmath90 is a strict lower limit for the mass of the presumed pulsar . this value ( the largest for any evaporating black - widow or redback - type pulsar ) makes it virtually certain that the unobserved , heat - producing object is a neutron star .",
    "it is unlikely that the blue spectrum seen at optical minimum is photospheric emission from a white - dwarf primary , in accord with the lack of spectral features and the sub - rayleigh - jeans spectral index .",
    "since the center of light of the heated face is inside the secondary center of mass and since sin@xmath91 , the true primary mass is likely substantially higher .",
    "our counterpart , source 38 in the 21ks _ chandra x - ray observatory _ acis observation of @xcite , provides @xmath92 x - ray photons .",
    "we fit these data to a power - law model with _",
    "ciao / sherpa _ , finding a photon index @xmath93 , absorption @xmath94@xmath95 , and unabsorbed flux @xmath96 ( 0.58kev , @xmath97 statistic , 90% uncertainty ) , in agreement with the @xcite measurements .",
    "note that @xmath10mag corresponds to @xmath98@xmath95 , so the x - rays suggest that j1653 is seen through much of the galactic dust layer .",
    "improved measurements are needed to pin down the extinction and distance .",
    "we folded the x - ray counts on the photometric ephemeris and find no evidence for an eclipse or for any orbital variation , although given the limited counts , shallow modulation could have been missed .",
    "a similar fold of the lat gev photons also shows no evidence for orbital modulation .",
    "lacking kinematic constraints from @xmath8-ray or radio timing , our picture of j1653 is still imprecise .",
    "some basic pulsar scaling laws can , however , be used to check consistency with the evaporating binary scenario .",
    "first , @xmath8-ray pulsars have a heuristic luminosity @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "next , x - ray emission from rotation - powered pulsars scales as @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "the observed fluxes @xmath101 and @xmath102 then give estimates of @xmath103 and @xmath104kpc . @xcite describe how pulsar spin - down flux ( assumed isotropic at separation @xmath105 ) heats the companion from a `` night''-side @xmath106 to a maximum @xmath107 according to @xmath108 finding a typical efficiency @xmath109 for black - widow systems . for j1653",
    ", we have @xmath110 and @xmath111 , so we can expect @xmath112 .",
    "the effective @xmath107 is not well measured , but from our spectroscopy it seems lower than 6500k .",
    "this implies @xmath113 , somewhat lower than the @xmath114 estimate above , and suggesting a smaller @xmath115kpc as well . finally , the extinction - corrected optical flux from the heated face ( diff spectrum ) is @xmath116 with @xmath117 using the bolometric correction for 6000k . from this",
    "we derive an effective companion radius of @xmath118 .",
    "this gives @xmath119 , which can be compared with the roche radius @xmath120 . for a redback - type mass ratio @xmath121",
    "this gives @xmath122 , so the companion would be well inside the roche lobe . for a black - widow - type mass ratio @xmath123 , @xmath124 , so the companion fills the roche lobe , even for somewhat larger @xmath62 , smaller @xmath125 , and smaller @xmath126 .",
    "we would like to improve the mass and fill - factor estimates .",
    "the absence of x - ray or @xmath8-ray eclipses implies @xmath127 , so the minimum pulsar mass ( @xmath86 lower limit ) is 1.62m@xmath6 for a substellar ( black - widow - type ) companion . for a redback - type @xmath128m@xmath6 companion ,",
    "the limit is @xmath129m@xmath6 .",
    "one generally refines the constraints on the center - of - light to center - of - mass correction factor @xmath130 and the inclination @xmath131 via light - curve modeling .",
    "this is important since @xmath132 and the pulsar mass grows as @xmath133 . at present",
    "such modeling is not very constraining since our photometry is poor and nonsimultaneous .",
    "additional observations can , of course , remedy this .",
    "more important , though , are the apparently nonthermal flux which dominates the optical light at minimum brightness and the possible light - curve asymmetries near maximum brightness .",
    "these suggest that a strong evaporating wind distorts the light curve and makes it difficult to detect the companion at minimum brightness .",
    "simple heating models may not be adequate .",
    "this also appears true for other black - widow systems with well - studied light curves , j1311 @xcite and psr j1544 + 4937 @xcite .",
    "improved understanding of evaporative winds and their effect on the light curves seem crucial for refined measurements of the short - period black widows .",
    "j1653 certainly motivates such efforts : the small @xmath35 , peculiar companion composition , and likely large @xmath134 all flag this as an extreme member of the evaporating - pulsar population .",
    "once @xmath8 and/or radio pulses are detected , we plan to pursue such studies .",
