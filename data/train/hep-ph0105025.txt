    "recently a proposal has been made to carry out a dedicated search for the electric dipole moment of the muon at the level of @xmath13@xcite .",
    "the current experimental limit on the muon edm from the previous cern experiment is @xmath14ecm@xcite and thus the proposed experiment will improve the sensitivity for @xmath2 by a factor of @xmath15 to @xmath16 over its previous measurement .",
    "as is well known the electric dipole moment is an important probe of new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "thus the standard model predicts very small values for the edms@xcite , e.g. , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "however , many models of new physics predict much larger edms@xcite and thus an increased sensitivity of edm measurements is a probe of new physics .",
    "supersymmetric ( susy ) models with softly broken supersymmetry are an example of this class of models as they provide abundant new sources of cp violation since the soft breaking parameters can be complex with cp phases o(1 ) .",
    "in fact , with cp phases of o(1 ) an order of magnitude estimate shows that the edm of the electron and of the neutron are already in excess of the experimental limits which are@xcite    d_e<4.310 ^ -27ecm ,   d_n<6.310 ^ -26ecm several possible solutions have been offered to resolve this problem .",
    "one possibility is to assume that the phases are small which , however , requires a fine tuning@xcite .",
    "a second possibility is to assume that the sparticles circulating in the loops are heavy , of masses in the range of several tev , which , however , puts the sparticle spectrum beyond the reach of even the large hadron collider ( lhc)@xcite .",
    "another alternative discussed more recently is the possibility of cancellations@xcite allowing for a satisfaction of the experimental limits on the electron and on the neutron edms with cp phases @xmath20 and the sparticle spectrum within reach of accelerators .",
    "in addition to the above in certain specific unified models , such as in left - right symmetric models , the troublesome phases may automatically be small@xcite .",
    "now the normal expectation is that the edms scale by the fermion mass and thus the muon edm should be related to the electron edm by the scaling relation @xmath21 . using the experimental limit on the electron edm of eq.(1 )",
    "this leads to @xmath22 which is below the sensitivity of the bnl experiment .",
    "however , we will show in this paper that the scaling relation @xmath23 can be violated strongly in the presence of nonuniversalities .",
    "the breakdown of scaling allows significant enhancement of the muon edm , by as much as a factor of 100 , over the scaling result and @xmath24 can be gotten which is well within reach of the proposed brookhaven experiment .",
    "the analysis presented here is within the framework of mssm .",
    "thus we do not assume any symmetries between the squark and the slepton sector and consequently there are no constraints on the slepton sector arising from limits on flavor changing neutral currents in the quark sector .",
    "further , we do not impose the constraints from @xmath25 .",
    "this sector of the theory involves additional parameters in mssm and thus no stringent constraints from this sector are expected on the edm analysis . however , a similar analysis within a specific unified model will require inclusion of such constraints .",
    "in addition to the mechanism discussed here , there exist previous analyses where a muon edm much larger than what is implied by scaling can be generated . these consist of analyses in left - right symmetric models@xcite , in a two higgs doublet model@xcite , and in models with certain assumed patterns of textures in the flavor space@xcite .",
    "the mechanism we propose in this paper is different .",
    "our technique is a natural extension of the cancellation mechanism using nonuniversalities which are already present within mssm .",
    "the outline of the rest of the paper is as follows : in sec.2 we review the basic formula for a charged lepton edm in mssm . in the analysis",
    "we impose the constraints on @xmath26 from the bnl experiment@xcite as a recent analysis has shown that the bnl result provides stringent constraints on the phases@xcite . in sec.3",
    "we give a discussion of the analysis and give results .",
    "conclusions are given in sec.4 .",
    "the basic idea we use is that the cancellations arise between the chargino and the neutralino exchange contributions to the edm of the electron but such cancellations occur only partially or negligibly for the case of the edm of the muon .",
    "the mechanism which brings this about arises from nonuniversality between the electron and the muon sector .",
    "we give now the details of the analysis .",
    "first we review some basic formula that will be relevant in our discussion .",
    "the chargino exchange contribution to the charged lepton edm is given by@xcite d__l_(chargino)= _",

    "it is easily seen that the chargino exchange contribution to the edm of the charged lepton depends on just one combination of the phases , i.e. , @xmath35 .",
    "the neutralino exchange contribution is given by@xcite d__l_(neutralino)= _",
    "k=1 ^ 2_i=1 ^ 4 i m ( _ ik^_l _ ) q_b ( ) where @xmath36 and where @xmath37 is the charge of the lepton and @xmath38 is given by _",

    "there are several ways in which the nonuniversality between the selectron and the smuon channels can appear .",
    "for instance , the sneutrino mass with the e flavor , i.e. , @xmath46 may be different from the sneutrino mass for the @xmath32 flavor , i.e. , @xmath47 . in this case",
    "if one arranges cancellations between the chargino and the neutralino contributions to occur for @xmath0 so that @xmath0 is in accord with the current experimental limits , then such exact cancellations would not occur for the muon channel due to different chargino contributions in this case because of the disparity between the masses @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "a similar situation arises because of the nonuniversality in @xmath50 and @xmath51 and between @xmath52 and @xmath53 . in this case",
    "if the cancellation is arranged between the chargino and the neutralino for @xmath0 it would be upset for @xmath2 due to neutralino contributions being different between the two cases .",
    "there is yet a third possibility in which one may achieve a large cancellation between the chargino and the neutralino contributions for @xmath0 but only a partial or no cancellation for @xmath2 .",
    "this consists in introducing nonuniversality only in the trilinear soft parameters in the selectron and the smuon channels , i.e. , nonuniversalities between @xmath54 and @xmath55 . in the following analysis we focus on this type of nonuniversality . in the analysis",
    "we impose the constraints from the recent results from brookhaven@xcite on the size of new physics contributions to @xmath56 .",
    "this experiment finds a deviation from the standard model result@xcite at the @xmath57 level so that@xcite    a_^exp - a_^sm=43(16)10 ^ -10 it has been known for some time that the supersymmetric electro - weak contributions can make a significant correction to the muon g-2 and the size of this contribution can be as large or larger than the standard model electro - weak correction@xcite .",
    "it is also known that contributions to @xmath58 from models with large extra dimensions are not significant and thus do not produce a strong background for supersymmetric contributions@xcite ( see , however , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "assuming then that all of the effect of eq.(8 ) comes from supersymmetry , one finds that the sparticle spectrum is severely constrained by the bnl result and further that the sign of @xmath32 in the standard convention@xcite with cp invariance is determined to be positive@xcite ( similar conclusions are drawn in refs.@xcite .",
    "see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "a positive @xmath32 sign is also the one favored by the @xmath59 constraint@xcite .",
    "another important phenomenon is the effect of cp violating phases on @xmath60 .",
    "it was shown in ref.@xcite that @xmath60 is a very sensitive function of the cp phases@xcite and that the cp phases can change both the magnitude and the sign of @xmath60 . in the analysis of ref.@xcite",
    "this sensitivity was used to constrain the cp phases that enter @xmath60 by using the constraint of eq.(8 ) .",
    "it was found that as much as ( 60 - 90)% of the parameter space of cp phases may be eliminated by the bnl constraint@xcite .",
    "the total contribution to @xmath60 arises from the chargino and neutralino exchanges where the dominant contribution is from the chargino exchange and in the presence of phases is given by@xcite a^^+ _ = _",

    "@xmath61=@xmath62@xmath63 , @xmath64=@xmath65 @xmath66 and @xmath67 is defined as in eq.(2 ) . as in the case of the edm analysis",
    ", it is easily seen that the chargino exchange depends on the single phase combination @xmath35 , while the neutralino contribution depends on several phase combinations , i.e. , @xmath68 ( i=1.2 ) and on @xmath69 . in carrying out the analysis we use the @xmath70 dependent formulae for @xmath60 and",
    "impose the constraints of eqs.(1 ) and ( 8) on the phases .",
    "the general framework of our analysis is mssm . however , since the parameter space of this model is rather large we restrict our numerical analysis to a subset of parameters .",
    "this subset consists of @xmath71 ( the universal scalar mass at the gut scale ) , @xmath72 ( magnitude of the universal gaugino mass at the gut scale ) , @xmath73 ( the magnitude of the trilinear coupling of the soft parameters at the gut scale for all sectors except the smuon sector ) , and @xmath74 where @xmath75 gives mass to the up quarks and @xmath76 gives mass to the down quarks and the leptons .",
    "the magnitude of the higgs mixing parameter @xmath32 is determined by the radiative breaking of the electro - weak symmetry .",
    "we choose as independent the set of phases @xmath31 , @xmath77 ( i=1,2,3 ) ( the phases of the u(1 ) , su(2 ) and su(3 ) gauginos ) and @xmath78 , the phase of @xmath79 .",
    "the trilinear soft parameters @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath54 etc are all evolved from @xmath79 using renormalization group ( rg ) equations .",
    "additionally in the smuon sector we choose @xmath82 and @xmath83 to be independent parameters to generate the desired nonuniversalities in the smuon sector .",
    "the model described above is essentially a supergravity unified model@xcite with nonuniversalities@xcite in the gaugino sector and in the slepton sector .",
    "our technique consists in first finding a set of soft parameters with large phases which give a simultaneous cancellation for the case of the edm of the electron and of the neutron .",
    "nonuniversalities are then used to generate violations of scaling and a large edm for the muon . in the analysis",
    "we include sbottom contribution to the gluonic dimension six operator in the case of the neutron and include two loop higgs mediated contributions of the type discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "regarding the g-2 constraint we use a 2 sigma error corridor on eq.(8 ) to constraint the sparticle spectrum and the phases , i.e. , we use @xmath84 .    in table 1 we exhibit five cases each of which leads to a cancellation in the electron and in the neutron channel producing @xmath0 and @xmath1 in conformity with the current data as shown in column 3 of table 1 .",
    "for the muon case we then use all the same parameters except @xmath55 .",
    "we consider three different cases here : ( 1 ) universal case where @xmath85 , ( 2 ) @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and ( 3 ) @xmath88 and @xmath87 .",
    "results of the analysis using these three cases are shown in table 2 , table 3 and table 4 respectively .",
    "thus for case(1 ) one finds that the cancellations between the chargino and the neutralino contributions for @xmath2 parallel the cancellations of these contributions for @xmath0 .",
    "thus here a rough scaling results , i.e. , @xmath89 as can be seen by comparing @xmath0 of table 1 with @xmath2 of table 2 ( a detailed discussion of this phenomenon is given in the appendix ) . in this case",
    "the predicted values of @xmath2 are smaller that than what the proposed brookhaven experiment can probe .",
    "next we discuss the other two cases which are more promising because they contain nonuniversality of the soft parameter a which leads to a breakdown of scaling and allows an enhancement of @xmath2 over what is allowed by scaling .",
    "( a detailed discussion of the breakdown of scaling is given in the appendix ) .",
    "for case ( 2 ) the nonuniversality effects arise from @xmath87 and the cancellation between the chargino and the neutralino contributions to @xmath2 do not parallel the cancellation in @xmath0 . because of this one has only a partial cancellation in @xmath2 in the region of the parameter space where one has a large cancellation for @xmath0 .",
    "this phenomenon leads to a violation of scaling and one obtains here values of @xmath2 much larger than expected from scaling .",
    "the results are exhibited in table 3 and one finds that for entries ( a)-(e ) @xmath2 is typically larger than its corresponding value in table 2 by a factor of 2 - 3 .",
    "further , all @xmath2 values listed in table 3 fall in the range @xmath90ecm which is within reach of the proposed brookhaven experiment@xcite .",
    "finally we consider case(3 ) where both the magnitude and the phase of @xmath55 differ from @xmath54 . in this case",
    "one can manage a much larger value for @xmath2 over the value expected from scaling .",
    "the results are shown in table 4 .",
    "in computing @xmath2 in this case we have used all the same parameters as in table 1 except that the magnitude and the phase of @xmath55 are treated as independent . as can be seen from table 4 one",
    "finds that @xmath2 can be as large as o(@xmath91)ecm in this case . for the above three cases",
    "the @xmath60 listed in tables ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) is consistent with the 2 sigma error corridor constraint as discussed at the end of the first paragraph in this section .",
    "a plot of @xmath4 as a function of @xmath73 with the other parameters fixed by table 1 is given in figs .",
    "thus fig.1 contains case ( a ) of table 1 , fig.2 contains case ( b ) of table 1 etc .",
    "the three cases , ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) for @xmath2 given by tables 2 , 3 and 4 are also plotted .",
    "these figures thus illustrate graphically the results discussed above .",
    "the analysis of figs.1 - 5 shows that the effect of nonuniversality is to shift the point of maximum cancellation between the chargino and the neutralino contributions for @xmath2 relative to what happens in @xmath0 .",
    "this shift creates a much larger value for @xmath2 in the region where @xmath0 is compatible with the current experimental limits .",

    "in this paper we have investigated the effect of nonuniversality in the trilinear soft parameter in the slepton sector on the scaling relation @xmath3 .",
    "we have shown that large violations of this relation can occur in the region of the parameter space where the cancellation mechanism operates in the presence of nonuniversalities . using this mechanism it",
    "is then shown that values of @xmath2 as much as a factor of 100 larger than implied by the scaling relation can be obtained .",
    "two branches of solutions were found . in the first solution the magnitudes @xmath82 and @xmath92 were assumed to be universal and the nonuniversalities arose only in the phases of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , i.e.,@xmath93 . in this case violations of scaling were generally modest but still sufficient to give @xmath2 of size @xmath13 consistent with eqs.(1 ) and ( 8) and within reach of the sensitivity of the proposed bnl experiment@xcite . in the second solution nonuniversalities both in the magnitude and in the phase of the trilinear soft parameter were assumed , i.e. , @xmath88 and @xmath94 . in this",
    "case violations of the scaling formula were as much as a factor of 100 and one can get @xmath24 consistent with eqs.(1 ) and ( 8) . both of these possibilities are very encouraging for the observation of the muon edm in the proposed brookhaven experiment which can explore the muon edm at the level of @xmath7ecm",
    ". thus one may construe that the proposed brookhaven experiment is an important probe of both @xmath70 violation and of nonuniversalities in the muon sector .",
    "a communication from yannis semertzidis which led us to the present investigation is acknowledged .",
    "this research was supported in part by the nsf grant phy-9901057 .",
    "in this appendix we explain the phenomenon seen in tables 1 - 4 and in figs.1 - 5 where one finds that for the universal values of @xmath95 the edm of the muon and of the electron satisfy a scaling relation , i.e. , @xmath96 , in the cancellation region , while violations of scaling occur due to nonuniversalities in a. we exhibit this phenomenon for both chargino and neutralino contributions . now",
    "the chargino exchange contribution is strictly linear in the lepton mass as can be seen from eq.(2 ) and we write @xmath97 where @xmath98 is now independent of the charged lepton mass . for the neutralino exchange contribution to @xmath99",
    "there are many types of terms that contribute .",
    "the leading dependence of the lepton mass arises from @xmath100 while subleading dependence arises from the outside smuon mass factors in eq.(4 ) . thus to understand the scaling phenomenon and its breakdown we focus on @xmath100 which can be expanded as follows using eq.(5 ) :    _ ik^_l_=a_0c_0x^2_1id^*__l 1k_d__l 2k_+b_0c_0 x_1ix_2id^*__l 1k_d__l 2k _",
    "-__l_a_0x_1ix_3i|d__l 1k_|^2 + -__l_b_0x_2ix_3i|d__l 1k_|^2- _ _",
    "l_c_0x_1ix_3i|d__l 2k_|^2 + ^2__l_x^2_3id__l 1k_d^*__l 2k _ where @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 are independent of the lepton mass .",
    "the first two terms on the right hand side of eq.(10 ) are linear in lepton mass through the relation im(d^*__l11_d__l21_)=-im(d^*__l12_d__l22_)= + ( m_0|a__l_|_f + || _ ) .",
    "the third , fourth and fifth terms on the right hand side of eq.(10 ) have a leading linear dependence on the lepton mass through the parameter @xmath27 and have additional weaker dependence on the lepton mass through the diagonalizing matrix elements @xmath104 . the last term in eq.(10 )",
    "is cubic in the lepton mass .",
    "however , in most of the parameter space cosidered , the first term in eq.(10 ) is the dominant one and controls the scaling behavior .",
    "thus for the case when all the soft susy breaking parameters including a are universal ( i.e. , @xmath105 ) in eq . ( 11 ) ) , one finds from eqs.(2 ) , ( 4 ) , ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) , that scaling results , i.e. , @xmath3 .",
    "this is borne out by the detailed numerical analysis as can be seen by comparing @xmath2 in table 2 with @xmath0 in table 1 , and also by comparing @xmath2 for the universal case ( dotted line ) with @xmath0 ( solid line with squares ) in figs.1 - 5 .",
    "however , for the nonuniversal case since the contribution from the a parameter is flavor dependent we have a breakdown of scaling here .",
    "this breakdown can be seen by comparing @xmath2 in tables 3 and 4 with @xmath0 in table 1 , and also by comparing @xmath2 for the nonuniversal cases ( dashed line with triangles pointed down and dashed line with triangles pointed up ) with @xmath0 ( solid line with squares ) in figs.1 - 5 .",
