    "the study of phase transitions in quantum field theory is of great interest in cosmology and particle physics .",
    "cosmological inflationary models @xcite , the electroweak phase transition @xcite , the formation of chiral condensates @xcite , are clear examples of the very interesting problems related to phase transitions in this context .    the first analyses of phase transitions in quantum field theory were based on the use of the finite temperature effective potential .",
    "the effective potential is useful only in quasi - static situations and therefore one must use the complete effective action in order to address the non - equilibrium aspects of the transition .",
    "the usual effective action is not adequate to study initial value problems since it gives the evolution equations for ` in - out ' matrix elements of the background fields .",
    "the equations for these matrix elements are neither real nor causal .",
    "the solution to this problem is to use the so called ` in - in ' or closed time path ( ctp ) effective action , introduced by schwinger and keldysh many years ago @xcite .",
    "this action gives real and causal evolution equations for the ` in - in ' mean value of the background fields .",
    "the ctp effective action has been used to analyze inflationary models , anisotropy dissipation in the early universe , the backreaction problem in semiclassical and stochastic gravity , the quantum to classical transition in quantum brownian motion and quantum field theory , etc . @xcite .",
    "there is however one aspect that , to our knowledge , has not been fully investigated .",
    "phase transitions occur via the formation and growth of _ spatial _ domains . inside these domains",
    ", the order parameter of the transition evolves dynamically , and one is usually interested in computing its temporal evolution .",
    "the order parameter is therefore _ the average of the quantum mean value of the field in a spatial volume of the size of the domain_.    in previous works , this problem has been addressed using different approaches . on the one hand ,",
    "phase transitions have been analyzed using the ctp effective action , assuming that the order parameter depends only on time .",
    "presumably , this time dependent function describes the dynamics of the order parameter inside one typical domain @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that domain growth is an effect characterized by the rapid evolution of ( exponentially unstable ) long wavelength modes .",
    "such a dynamics can be non - perturbatively described by a hartree approximation to the two - point correlation function @xcite . on the other hand , phenomenological langevin - like equations which account for dissipation and noise have been proposed and numerically solved ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for one such type of calculation , where the order parameter is coupled to a thermal bath and a markovian langevin equation is put forward in order to mimic thermal phase mixing during a first - order phase transition ) .    in this paper , as a step towards a first principle calculation , we will proceed using an analogy with what is done in the context of condensed matter @xcite .",
    "we will coarse grain our theory up to a length scale @xmath1 comparable to the initial size of a typical domain . in this way",
    ", we will define a ` coarse grained effective action ' ( cgea ) , which will be basically the usual ctp action in which only those modes of the scalar field with @xmath2 are integrated out . as a result of tracing the short wavelength modes ( the so - called  environmental \" degrees of freedom ) , the ctp average action , which depends on the long wavelength modes ( the so - called  system \" degrees of freedom ) , develops dissipation and noise terms .",
    "we will derive an exact evolution equation for the dependence of the cgea on the coarse graining scale . in principle",
    "it is possible to derive a langevin equation for the long wavelength order parameter @xmath3 starting from the cgea .",
    "however , in order to make the analysis more tractable , here we will compute the ctp average action using some simple approximations .",
    "the major approximation we will make is to ignore spatial correlations between different domains .",
    "this allows the study of the dynamics for coarse grained time - dependent configurations @xmath4 inside a given domain .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we define the cgea and compute it in the one loop approximation , making an adiabatic expansion .",
    "we should mention that by using such approximations we are not aiming at studying domain growth since , as we have already stated , they fail to describe such a dynamical process .",
    "rather our intention is to illustrate a simple calculation of the ctp effective action . in section 3",
    "we derive the exact renormalization group ( rg ) equation for the evolution of the cgea , which is a generalization to ctp of the euclidean wegner and houghton s rg equation @xcite . using a derivative expansion , in section",
    "iv we reduce this functional equation to a system of coupled differential equations , which are then numerically solved .",
    "the interest of the results is not only restricted to non - zero coarse graining scales , but they also provide non perturbative approximations to standard ( @xmath5 ) quantum field theory . in section 5 we make the conclusions .    in order to make contact with related works , we would like to mention that the cgea defined here was originally introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to study inflationary cosmology , and it was perturbatively evaluated in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to analyze the decoherence of the long wavelength sector of the @xmath0 field theory .",
    "it is also similar in spirit to the _ euclidean _ average effective action proposed earlier @xcite .",
    "the main difference between both actions is that the euclidean action averages the field over a space - time volume , while our ctp action averages the field over a spatial volume , and it is therefore more useful to study non - equilibrium situations .    in the above mentioned works , and also in this paper , the coarse grained or average effective action interpolates between the bare theory at @xmath6 ( the ultraviolet cutoff ) and the physical theory at the coarse graining scale .",
    "another possibility has been recently analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where an effective action is defined that interpolates between the physical theory at @xmath7 and the physical theory at @xmath8 .",
    "let us consider @xmath0 field theory in minkowski spacetime . in order to deal with non - equilibrium scenarios we follow schwinger - keldysh formulation , doubling the number of fields and imposing ctp boundary conditions .",
    "the coarse grained ctp effective action @xmath9 is defined as follows @xmath10   { \\cal d}[\\phi_-({\\vec q},t ) ] \\ ; e^{i s_{cl}(\\phi_+,\\phi_-)}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 .",
    "note that a sharp cutoff @xmath12 and an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath13 have been used .",
    "the functional integrals over the short wavelength modes are to be computed using standard ctp boundary conditions : the fields @xmath14 and @xmath15 must have only negative and positive frequency modes , respectively , in the past @xmath16 , and match in the future @xmath17 . in general , the ctp coarse grained effective action has an imaginary part , related to noise , and a real part , related to dissipation .",
    "the equations of motion derived from it are , however , real and causal .",
    "an exact calculation of the above defined action is quite difficult , and it is therefore necessary to use approximation methods . one possible approach is to make perturbations in the coupling constant @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "another possibility that we will explore here is to use a loop expansion . in the one loop approximation",
    "our effective action can be written as @xmath19 , where the last term is linear in @xmath20 .      even in the one loop approximation ,",
    "the effective action is a very complicated object and additional approximations are needed in order to get analytic results .",
    "the simplest approximation one can think of is the adiabatic approximation @xcite , in which one neglects the excitations of the quantum fluctuation field due to the time dependence of the background field @xmath21 .",
    "this approximation misses the very important stochastic aspects of the theory .",
    "however , it will be useful as a warm up and also to make contact with the euclidean works .",
    "we can write the mode functions as @xmath36 where the functions @xmath37 satisfy @xmath38 the adiabatic approximation consists in solving this equation using an expansion in derivatives of the background field .",

    "@xcite using a blocking procedure .",
    "the study of the potential @xmath54 shows that it is possible to have a non - trivial domain structure even in the symmetrical phase of the theory ( @xmath57 ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , for some range of the parameters of the theory , it may happen that , although @xmath57 , the squared bare mass is negative . in this case",
    ", the potential has a double well structure with two symmetrical non - zero minima for scales @xmath12 greater than a critical one @xmath58 , and has a unique minimum at @xmath59 for smaller values of @xmath12 ( see fig .",
    "the interpretation of this fact is that the average field fluctuates around zero for scales @xmath60 or around the non - zero minima for scales @xmath61 .",
    "the symmetrical phase therefore contains domains of size @xmath62 .",
    "we remark that this phenomenon takes place in the symmetrical phase of the theory , and should not be confused with spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) .    on the other hand , when ssb takes place ( @xmath63 ) , both the renormalized one loop potential and wave function renormalization develop an imaginary part for @xmath64 .",
    "these imaginary parts generate non - real terms in the equations of motion , and are artifacts of the adiabatic approximation .",
    "they have nothing to do with the noise terms in the ctp effective action that we have mentioned before .",
    "it is worth noting that the wave function renormalization diverges as @xmath12 approaches @xmath65 from above .",
    "this clearly shows that the adiabatic approximation is not adequate to describe the temporal evolution of the order parameter neither in the vicinity of @xmath65 nor for @xmath66 .",
    "as pointed out in ref.@xcite , the imaginary part in the effective potential is a signal for instabilities towards the formation of domains of size at least as great as @xmath67 .",

    "in this section we shall derive an exact ( non - perturbative ) renormalization group equation for the flow of the cgea .",
    "the approach follows that of wegner and houghton for euclidean spacetime .",

    "whose wave vectors satisfy @xmath25 ) the modes within the shell are set to zero .",
    "we use the notation @xmath75    the @xmath76 term is cubic in the modes within the shell , and it can be proved that it does not contribute in the limit @xmath77 ( basically , this is because one is doing a one loop calculation for the shell modes ) .",
    "the functional integrals over the shell modes have the ctp boundary conditions .",
    "a comment about the last exponential factor in eq.([exp ] ) is in order .",
    "usually one discards it because it is a surface term , but in the ctp formalism it must be kept since the boundary conditions are that @xmath78 with @xmath79 for the modes @xmath80 within the shell .    in order to evaluate the functional integrals we split the field as @xmath81 and",
    "impose the boundary conditions on the  classical \" fields @xmath82 , i.e. they vanish in the past @xmath16 ( negative and positive frequencies respectively ) and match in the cauchy surface at time @xmath17 .",
    "the fluctuations @xmath83 vanish both in the past and in the future .",
    "the classical fields are solutions to @xmath84 where we have splitted the cgea as @xmath85 with @xmath86 - \\int d^4x   \\left [ \\frac{1}{2 } ( \\partial_{\\mu } \\phi_-)^2 - \\frac{i \\epsilon}{2 } \\phi_-^2 \\right]\\ ] ] as before , in the functional derivatives the modes within the shell are set to zero .",
    "let @xmath87 be solutions to eq.([mod1 ] ) , vanishing in the past and satisfying an arbitrary normalization in the future , and let @xmath88 be the common value the fields take in the future .",
    "we can then write @xmath89 we first integrate over the common value @xmath88 and then proceed with the functional integration over the fluctuations @xmath83 ( both are gaussian integrals with `` source '' terms ) .",

    "similar conditions are to be used to evaluate the inverse @xmath95 .",
    "the equation ( [ exact ] ) is exact in the sense that no perturbative approximation has so far been used .",
    "it is the main result of the paper .",
    "it is similar to its euclidean counterpart @xcite , but involves two fields and ctp boundary conditions .",
    "it contains _ all _ the information of the influence of the short wavelength modes on the long wavelength ones , and should be the starting point for a non - perturbative analysis of decoherence , dissipation , domain formation and out of equilibrium evolution .",
    "the overwhelming complexity of the exact renormalization group equation means that in practice one is compelled to use some sort of truncation .",
    "the usual ones are expansions in the number of powers of the fields ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed analysis ) or in derivatives of them @xcite . in the following",
    "we shall make use of the derivative expansion approach .",
    "we will prove that , within this approach , the exact rg eq.([exact ] ) admits a solution of the form @xmath96 clearly this is not the most general form that can be imagined for the coarse grained action because contributions involving mixing of both fields are not taken into account .",
    "the main drawback of this approach is therefore that , as mentioned in section ii , we miss the stochastic aspects of the theory , such as dissipation and noise",
    ". however , the proposed form for the cgea will be enough for studying the renormalization group flow of real time field theories .    the great technical advantage of the form eq .",

    "is concerned , we expect that , as soon as we decrease the scale from @xmath130 , dissipative and noise terms will grow up : the cgea will develop an imaginary part ( related to noise ) and a real part containing interactions between the @xmath137 fields ( dissipation ) .",
