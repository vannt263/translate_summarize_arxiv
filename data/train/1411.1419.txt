    "over the past three years , two of the largest - ever hst stellar spectroscopic guest observer programs have been undertaken . the `` advanced spectral library ( astral ) '' project ( pi = t. ayres ) consists of two treasury programs , the first in cycle 18 on `` cool stars '' ( go-12278 ) and the second in the current cycle 21 on `` hot stars '' ( go-13346 ) .",
    "these programs are designed to collect a definitive set of representative , high - resolution ( r@xmath030,000 - 100,000 ) , high signal / noise ( s / n@xmath1100 ) spectra , with full uv coverage ( @xmath01150 - 3100  ) of prototypical stars across the hr diagram .",
    "the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) is ideally suited for this purpose and is the sole instrument used for the acquisition of the program spectra .",
    "the 8 f - m evolved late - type stars observed in astral / cool stars include iconic objects like betelgeuse , procyon , and pollux .",
    "in addition , this sample has been supplemented with hst observations from a separate chandra program , so that two main sequence stars ( @xmath2  cen a & b ) are included in this definitive dataset .",
    "astral / hot stars is in the process of observing 21 early - type stars , which span a broad range of spectral types between early - o and early - a , including main sequence and evolved stars , fast and slow rotators , as well as chemically peculiar and magnetic objects .",
    "the targets include equally iconic sirius , vega , and the classical wind source zeta puppis .",
    "all of these extremely high - quality stis uv echelle spectra will be available from the hst archive .",
    "high - level science products , produced by the astral science team using the best - available techniques to calibrate and merge the individual spectra into a definitive , single spectrum , can be found at http://casa.colorado.edu/@xmath0ayres / astral/.    in section 2 we describe the details of the observing programs and spectra now available for community use . in section 3",
    "we present some illustrative examples of the on - going scientific analyses by the astral science team , including a study of the outer atmospheres and winds of the two evolved m stars in the sample , the m3.4  iii giant gamma cru and the m2  iab supergiant alpha ori and a first look at a `` high definition '' uv spectrum of the magnetic chemically peculiar `` ap '' star hr 465 .",
    "these serve as examples of the kind of research that these data can enable , as the data will support investigations of a broad range of problems  stellar , interstellar , and beyond  by many investigators , for many years into the future .",
    "in this section , we describe the content of these programs and the observing strategies used to optimize the final , high - level science products being delivered .",
    "the cool stars program was carried out in hst cycle 18 from october 2010 through november 2011 .",
    "it was awarded 146 orbits to record eight bright late - type stars , including well - known stars like betelgeuse and procyon .",
    "cool stars are faint in uv , requiring @xmath020 orbits per target to achieve good s / n at full wavelength coverage with the stis echelles .",
    "the resolution of the spectra vary from r = 30,000 to 110,000 depending on wavelength and target brightness , as the goal was to obtain the highest resolution possible with reasonable exposure times in a given wavelength regime .",
    "this sample has been supplemented with observations of equivalent quality from a separate chandra program , which had hst observations as a component , so that two main sequence stars ( @xmath2  cen a & b ) are included in this dataset , along with the 8 evolved stars .",
    "the science team includes many co - investigators , covering a variety of topical areas and providing complementary ground - based observations and relevant atomic physics information for the analysis of the spectra .",
    "the astral - i program was driven by a desire to enable the study of : 1 ) magnetic activity , which is most conspicuous at the highest energies ( fuv and x - rays ) , 2 ) stellar mass loss , which is most prominently seen in the uv resonance lines of abundant elements such as h  i , o  i , c  ii , fe  ii , and mg  ii , 3 ) the interstellar medium , also seen in the same uv resonance lines , and 4 ) the complex atmospheric dynamics exhibited by these stars , due to the mysterious chromospheric and coronal heating mechanism(s ) , seen in the fuv  hot lines \" , such as si  iii , si  iv , c  iv , etc .    the resulting spectra , in compressed / downsampled form to permit display in a single figure ,",
    "are illustrated in fig .",
    "we note that these data are the spectral equivalent of the hubble imaging `` deep fields '' , in that one can zoom in on the final , co - added spectrum repeatedly and reveal more and more features and information , due to their very high s / n and resolution*.    centauri a & b ) for comparison to the astral sample , which is mostly giants .",
    "typical late - type stars show photospheric continuum longward of 2000   ( and mg ii @xmath32800   emission ) , but shortward display numerous chromospheric emission lines .",
    "strong 1300 - 1600   absorptions in @xmath2  ori are cold circumstellar co bands . ]    the observing strategy used to maximize the quality of these spectra , in terms of s / n and resolution , within the time available , is shown in fig .",
    "2 . the primary guidelines used to formulate this strategy were to : 1 ) use highest - resolution mode / setting available and narrowest slit possible , within a reasonable total exposure time , 2 ) exposures were divided into subexposures to mitigate fixed pattern noise , and 3 ) at least one observation of each type was scheduled near a peak - up to ensure the best possible flux and wavelength calibrations .",
    "post - processing of the spectra corrects wavelength distortions identified in previous studies of stis wavecal lamps , updated with new calstis dispersion solutions from t. ayres `` deep lamp project '' and",
    "special techniques were used to optimally splice and merge the orders of the echellegrams .",
    "the hot stars program focuses on the warm half of the h - r diagram .",
    "it was awarded 230 orbits in the current cycle 21 , starting in august 2013 and continuing through most of 2014 .",
    "the program observes 21 targets , including star - gazer favorites vega , sirius , and regulus , and classic windy - star zeta puppis ; normal and chemically peculiar stars , fast and slow rotators ; magnetic and other exotica .",
    "eleven targets have been fully observed to date .",
    "the program spectra are illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "3 , which shows compressed astral spectra in color and `` place - holder '' iue spectra in black for stars not yet observed in the astral - ii program .    we summarize in fig .",
    "4 the observing strategy used to optimize the signal - to - noise and resolution of each spectrum within the allocated observing time . we note in particular that this program was only made feasible due to the execution of a special go calibration program , between the times of the astral - i and astral - ii programs , to commission several previously `` available but unsupported '' neutral density slits on stis .",
    "the previously supported slits had a huge gap in attenuation .",
    "the standard , clear slits transmit too much light and would have saturated the detectors , while the supported neutral density slits ( nd=2 and nd=3 ) attenuate the light by 2 and 3 orders of magnitude ( factors of 100x and 1000x ) , respectively , and would have required too much observing time to be practical .",
    "t. ayres in go program 12567 (  bridging stis s neutral density desert \" ) therefore calibrated a set of `` available but unsupported '' nd ( neutral density)-filtered long slits ( 31x0.05nda / ndb / ndc ) that can be used with the stis echelles , and which provide intermediate attenuations between the standard ( nd=0 ) spectroscopic slits ( 0.2x0.06 , 0.2x0.09 , or 0.1x0.03 ) and the ( only two ) supported nd slits : 0.2x0.05nd ( nd=2 ) and 0.3x0.05nd ( nd=3 ) .",
    "these intermediate nd slits provide attenuations of nd=0.6 , 1.0 , and 1.4 ( factors of 4x , 10x , and 25x ) .",
    "the use of these slits can be seen in fig .",
    "4 . in this figure",
    ", tall rectangles represent 96-minute hst orbits ; 3 - 4 orbits constitute a `` visit '' ( circled numerals ) .",
    "colored rectangles indicate echelle settings ; vertical size is wavelength coverage .",
    "the shorter rectangles are high - resolution settings , taller are medium - resolution settings , and horizontal size is exposure duration .",
    "the lower hatched zone highlights fuv ( 1150 - 1700  ) ; upper clear band is nuv ( 1700 - 3100  ) .",
    "the guidelines for the observing strategies were similar to those used for astral - i : 1 ) use highest - resolution mode / setting and narrowest spectral slit possible within reasonable exposure times , 2 ) break up exposures to mitigate fixed pattern noise , and 3 ) schedule at least one observation of each type near peak - up .",
    "in addition , special neutral density slits , as noted above were used for brighter objects .",
    "here we present a couple of examples of some of the early science results from the astral - i and astral - ii programs .",
    "one of the studies being performed as part of the astral - i program is an investigation of the dynamics and wind of the coolest stars . as part of this",
    ", we have used observations of fe  ii lines of different strength to map the wind acceleration in the two m - stars in the astral - i sample , @xmath2  ori ( m2  iab ) and @xmath4  cru ( m3.4  iii ) .",
    "the fe  ii profiles vary with the intrinsic strength of the lines , as the photons detected at earth originate higher in the atmosphere of the star for lines of higher opacity .",
    "therefore , as we view lines of increasing line strength , two things happen : 1 ) the chromospheric emission lines increase in width due to opacity - broadening , and 2 ) the overlying wind absorptions become stronger and shift to bluer wavelengths as the wind velocity increases with height .",
    "this behavior is shown in fig .",
    "5 , which shows that the @xmath2  ori wind acceleration appears small or non - existent compared to that seen by carpenter et al .",
    "( 1997 , apj , 479 , 970 ) in ghrs observations taken in 1992 , while the @xmath4  cru wind seems to be very similar to that seen previously in ghrs spectra .",
    "the astral - ii program includes observations of the ap star hr 465 , which was chosen as a prototypical example of an a - type magnetic cp star .",
    "this spectrum is of extremely high quality in terms of both signal / noise and resolution and reveals a bright continuum that is absolutely blanketed by a sea of absorption features - so much so , that it is doubtful that a true continuum point exists anywhere in the 1200 - 3200   range .",
    "hr  465 has a global magnetic field @xmath02200 gauss , which varies with a period of @xmath023.3 years @xcite .",
    "it has a spectral type of b9pe ( simbad ) , and a t@xmath5  @xmath010,723  k @xcite and log(g ) = 4.01 @xcite .",
    "the strength of the cr and eu features are also known to vary with a @xmath023 year period @xcite . @xcite analyzed iue spectra and found strong iron - peak element lines but an underabundance on some ions of low atomic number , such as c. pt  ii was seen in 1970 s iue data , but au  ii , hg  ii , and bi  ii were uncertain and rare earth elements appeared weaker than in optical spectra .",
    "we have begun determinations of element abundances , concentrating on the heavy ( exotic ) elements of most interest , in the astral - ii spectrum of hr  465 , which was taken during rare earth element ( ree ) minimum state .",
    "our abundance measurements are obtained by comparison of the observed spectra with synthetic spectra , as shown in figures 6 and 7 ."
