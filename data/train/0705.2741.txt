    "observations of polarized radio emission provide a way to study magnetic fields in galaxies .",
    "the observed plane of polarization of optically thin , linearly polarized synchrotron emission is perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field projected on the sky , unless faraday rotation changes the plane of polarization as the radiation travels through a plasma with a magnetic field component along the line of sight .",
    "the plane of polarization of emission with wavelength @xmath3 ( m ) rotates by an angle @xmath4 ( rad ) , according to @xmath5 with electron density @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , line of sight component of the magnetic field @xmath8 ( @xmath9 g ) , and line of sight distance element @xmath10 ( pc ) .",
    "the rotation measure @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is a property of the medium along the line of sight from the source to the observer .",
    "rotation measures can be derived from multi - frequency observations of polarized emission , fitting @xmath4 as a function of @xmath13 .",
    "rotation measures of compact polarized sources have been used to constrain models of the galactic magnetic field , e.g. @xcite .",
    "observations of diffuse polarized galactic emission have revealed structures in the magneto - ionic medium that remain undetected in total intensity , because an ionized region can have negligible emission measure , yet still produce measurable faraday rotation @xcite . however ,",
    "interpretation of structures in diffuse polarized emission is difficult , as both polarized emission and faraday rotation may occur intermixed anywhere along the line of sight .",
    "@xcite and @xcite reported depolarization of extragalactic sources by regions of high emission measure in the lmc and the southern galactic plane survey @xcite respectively . in this letter , we report detection of depolarization of extragalactic sources on much larger angular scales by the local magneto - ionic medium .",
    "the main dataset for our analysis is the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) @xcite , a single - frequency 1.4 ghz continuum survey of the sky north of declination @xmath14 with the vla in d configuration ( @xmath15 angular resolution ) .",
    "the nvss bandwidth is the sum of two 42 mhz wide bands , but separated by 70 mhz in frequency .",
    "the principal data products are images in stokes i , q , and u , and a source catalog of 2-dimensional gaussians fitted to compact structures in these images .",
    "the mean noise level of the nvss in q and u is 0.29 mjy beam@xmath16 .",
    "figure  [ shadows - fig ] shows images of the number density @xmath17(sources per square degree ) of nvss sources with polarized intensity @xmath18 mjy beam@xmath16 , smoothed to a resolution of @xmath19 , h@xmath1  intensity composed by @xcite from the vtss @xcite , shassa @xcite , and wham @xcite surveys , and diffuse polarized intensity at 1.4 ghz from the drao 26-m polarization survey @xcite .",
    "the number density of polarized sources shows distinct depressions ( dark areas ) on angular scales @xmath20 , some of which coincide with enhanced h@xmath1  emission .",
    "most conspicuous is a ring centered on @xmath21 that coincides with an h@xmath1  shell associated with the gum nebula .",
    "we refer to these structures as polarization shadows .    for the most significant features in figure  [ shadows - fig]a",
    ", table  [ shadows - tab ] lists galactic coordinates , angular diameter , minimum source density @xmath22 , h@xmath1  intensity averaged over a 2 degree box at the minimum of @xmath17 , identification with known hii  regions , and distance .",
    "these features have values of @xmath17  a factor 2  4 smaller than the mean background of 6.6 sources deg@xmath23 . the rms noise level @xmath24 in figure  [ shadows - fig]a caused by statistical fluctuations in @xmath17 , is 1.3 sources deg@xmath23 .",
    "the contour in figure  [ shadows - fig]a at half the background source density is therefore 2.5@xmath24 below the mean value of @xmath17 .",
    "table  [ shadows - tab ] is complete for features with @xmath25 deg@xmath23 .",
    "a comprehensive analysis of smaller structures will be deferred to a following paper .",
    "the association of several polarization shadows with nearby hiiregions is the strongest indication that these shadows are real .",
    "hiiregions are also known to depolarize diffuse emission @xcite .",
    "we inspected nvss images , and also verified that the structures were robust against variation of the threshold in @xmath26 .",
    "the polarization shadows have no counterpart in the all - sky images of total nvss source density , or nvss noise amplitude .",
    "the structures are also visible in an image of mean fractional polarization , demonstrating that the mean fractional polarization is lower in these regions .",
    "some apparent excesses in @xmath17  are seen near bright radio emission in the galactic plane .",
    "these excesses , seen in white in figure  [ shadows - fig]a , are the result of confusion from small - scale structure in galactic emission , and residual sidelobes around bright emission .",
    "we exclude these regions from our analysis .",
    "the nvss contains small areas ( typically @xmath27 across ) with missing polarization data .",
    "most of these areas exist along lines of constant right ascension in the declination range @xmath28 to @xmath29 , which intersects the galactic equator at @xmath30 .",
    "we have verified that the features in table  [ shadows - tab ] are not the result of holes in the sky coverage of the nvss .",
    "we have identified these holes and their effect on @xmath17  is almost always lost in the noise .",
    "three extended polarization shadows listed in table  [ shadows - tab ] are found in regions where @xmath31 r. despite the low h@xmath1  intensity , these shadows are among the deepest in @xmath22 .",
    "these shadows coincide with minima in diffuse polarized emission in the drao 26-m polarization survey @xcite shown in figure  [ shadows - fig]c .",
    "one of these is shown in figure  [ shadows_detail - fig ] .",
    "the features seen in the drao survey also exist in the effelsberg medium latitude survey by @xcite .",
    "this polarization shadow coincides with an edge in diffuse polarized emission .",
    "a diffuse polarized intensity filament coincides with a higher polarized source density between the two strongest shadows .",
    "large changes in polarization angle are also seen associated with the depressions in @xmath17 .",
    "the polarization shadow in figure  [ shadows_detail - fig ] overlaps in part with the canadian galactic plane survey @xcite .",
    "@xcite note a diagonal band of low diffuse polarized intensity extending from @xmath32 to @xmath33 , the approximate course of the polarization shadow .",
    "a triangular region of depolarization noted by these authors at @xmath34 , @xmath35 coincides with the deeper part of this shadow .",
    "rotation measures of polarized sources in this region are @xmath36 rad m@xmath23 , with large variations on the scale of a few degrees @xcite .",
    "unpublished rotation measure data with more complete longitude coverage confirm a negative excess in rotation measure in the longitude range @xmath37 ( jo - anne brown , private communication ) that appears to be associated with this polarization shadow .",
    "polarization shadows in figure  [ shadows - fig ] indicate depolarization of the background sources , leaving fewer sources with polarized intensity above the threshold of 1 mjy .",
    "the mean amount of depolarization can be estimated using the fact that the differential polarized source counts for unresolved extragalactic sources vary approximately as @xmath38 for @xmath39 beam@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath17  is a fraction @xmath40 of the background value , the polarized intensity per source must on average be decreased by a factor @xmath41 .",
    "the value @xmath42 0.5  0.25 , typical for the shadows we detect , corresponds to @xmath43 0.76  0.57 .",
    "the polarized intensity of extragalactic sources in these regions is therefore decreased by up to @xmath44 .",
    "the large angular size of the polarization shadows suggests that these structures are relatively nearby .",
    "extragalactic sources may be depolarized if @xmath45 is high enough to produce differential faraday rotation over the frequency band ( bandwidth depolarization ) , or if significant @xmath11 fluctuations exist over the solid angle of the source ( beam depolarization ) .",
    "complete bandwidth depolarization for nvss sources requires @xmath46 340 @xmath12 , but figure 23 in @xcite shows that values of @xmath47  @xmath48",
    "require @xmath49  @xmath50 @xmath12 .",
    "most polarization shadows are poorly covered by published rotation measures , but shadows near @xmath51 that overlap with the cgps , coincide with areas where @xmath52 rad m@xmath23 , enough to cause bandwidth depolarization in the nvss .",
    "the polarization shadow associated with the gum nebula comes from a shell seen in h@xmath1  emission .",
    "@xcite detected this shell through individual rotation measures @xmath53 rad m@xmath23 , consistent with partial bandwidth depolarization of nvss sources by the shell .",
    "if the depolarization in the nvss is bandwidth depolarization , figure  [ shadows - fig ] shows regions of high @xmath11 up to galactic latitude @xmath54 , with the contour corresponding to @xmath55 @xmath12 .",
    "this @xmath11 amplitude map does not depend on sparsely sampled rotation measures to individual sources , but it provides complete sampling of the sky north of declination @xmath14 , outside the galactic plane .",
    "we found no evidence for large - scale structure in an image of @xmath17 convolved to a resolution of @xmath56 , providing an upper limit @xmath57 , or @xmath58",
    "@xmath12 for an extended component outside the galactic plane .",
    "this upper limit is in general agreement with all - sky @xmath11 images constructed by interpolation of rotation measures of extragalactic sources @xcite , although these images do not show structure on angular scales @xmath59 , because of the limited sky density of published rotation measures .",
    "most polarization shadows appear around @xmath60 where the line of sight is approximately along the local galactic magnetic field .",
    "larger values of @xmath45 are expected here , that can increase the amount of bandwidth depolarization , but other depolarization mechanisms may also be enhanced .",
    "beam depolarization of extragalactic sources implies @xmath11 fluctuations over the solid angle of the source . @xcite and @xcite report beam depolarization of extragalactic sources behind the lmc and in the sgps .",
    "beam depolarization is also a possible mechanism for at least some of the polarization shadows observed here .",
    "polarized sources fainter than 100 mjy in total intensity provide most of the signal in figure  [ shadows - fig]a .",
    "beam depolarization of these sources would require @xmath11 fluctuations on angular scales less than their median angular size of @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "the present data do not allow us to identify shadows with low @xmath45 where bandwidth depolarization can be excluded .",
    "more rotation measures of background sources in polarization shadows are needed to resolve this question .",
    "if beam depolarization is significant for compact sources , it must also be significant for diffuse emission .",
    "polarization shadows caused by beam depolarization should therefore provide valuable information for the interpretation of diffuse polarized galactic emission .",
    "while some deep extended polarization shadows are located in regions with low h@xmath1  intensity , table  [ shadows - tab ] also lists shadows associated with hii  regions where the h@xmath1  emission is a factor @xmath62 brighter .",
    "inspection of figure  [ shadows - fig ] shows that some bright h@xmath1  emission does not give rise to a polarization shadow , e.g. the hii  region ngc 1499 at @xmath63 @xmath64 , and the orion region at @xmath65 @xmath66 . some bright h@xmath1  emission from the gum nebula at negative latitudes",
    "also does not give rise to a polarization shadow .    in the absence of extinction ,",
    "h@xmath1  intensity in r is related to emission measure @xmath67 in @xmath68 pc following @xmath69 @xcite for gas at a temperature of 8000 k. regardless of the depolarization mechanism , @xmath11 structure caused exclusively by variations in electron density , would imply a correlation between emission measure and the depth of polarization shadows .",
    "the lack of correlation between @xmath22 and @xmath70 in table  [ shadows - tab ] , and the observation that some high @xmath67 objects do not give rise to polarization shadows , suggests that structure in the magnetic field is important in the formation of some or all polarization shadows .",
    "if all polarization shadows were caused by bandwidth depolarization in the nvss , the shadows may be regions in the interstellar medium where the magnetic field is more regular and aligned with the large - scale magnetic field than elsewhere .",
    "if all polarization shadows were caused by beam depolarization , they would represent a more random magnetic field than elsewhere . both beam depolarization and",
    "bandwidth depolarization may occur , but in either case polarization shadows suggest a different magnetic structure from their surroundings .",
    "the size and @xmath45 of the polarization shadows are of the same order of magnitude as the outer outer scale ( @xmath71 ) and standard deviation ( @xmath72 rad m@xmath23 ) of @xmath11 fluctuations in interarm regions in the sgps reported by @xcite .",
    "the polarization shadows may be nearby examples of structures corresponding to this outer scale of @xmath11 fluctuations .",
    "we demonstrate that nearby structures in the magneto - ionic medium create polarization shadows observed as depressions in the sky density of polarized sources in the nvss .",
    "some polarization shadows are associated with hii  regions , but other shadows are related to depolarized areas in diffuse galactic radio emission .",
    "partial bandwidth depolarization in the nvss is responsible for at least some polarization shadows , suggesting that these shadows are local regions of high @xmath45 .",
    "such regions may affect estimates of the scale height of the galactic magnetic field from @xmath11 data .",
    "if beam depolarization dominates , polarization shadows constrain depolarization mechanisms for diffuse polarized emission .",
    "this letter is based entirely on published surveys , and was made possible by the combined effort of the people who made them publicly available .",
