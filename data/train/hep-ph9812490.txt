    "an important theoretical issue of the perturbative qcd approach to exclusive processes is to check its self - consistency by studying perturbative corrections .",
    "this task was carried out in the modified minimal subtraction scheme for the next - to - leading ( nlo ) corrections to the photon - to - pion transition form factor ref.@xcite , the electromagnetic pion form factor @xcite , and the two - photon process @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the latter was only calculated for the special case of an equal momentum sharing distribution amplitude ( da ) . only in a recent analysis of the electromagnetic pion form factor",
    "@xcite has the nlo correction to the evolution of the da been completely taken into account .",
    "discrepancies in the one - loop approximation of the hard - scattering amplitude for the pion form factor were clarified in refs .",
    "the nlo corrections to the pion form factor and to the process @xmath1 are rather large at accessible momentum transfer ; however , it turned out that for the equal momentum sharing da the perturbative corrections to the integrated cross section of the charged meson production can almost be absorbed into the electromagnetic meson form factor ( see ref . ) .",
    "it was mentioned long ago that conformal symmetry plays an important role for the perturbative description of exclusive processes @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , conformal symmetry is broken by the renormalization of the uv - divergencies appearing in the hard - scattering part as well as in the da .",
    "there are two different sources for the breaking of conformal symmetry induced by : ( i ) the running coupling and ( ii ) the renormalization of the da .",
    "while the first one is proportional to the @xmath2-function and vanishes for a non - perturbative hypothetical fixed point , the latter appears in the minimal subtraction ( ms ) scheme ; fortunately , it is absent in a special subtraction scheme , which we will call conformal subtraction ( cs ) scheme @xcite .",
    "let us point out that the brodsky - lepage - mackenzie ( blm ) scale setting prescription is suitable to absorb conformal anomalies , which are in the cs scheme only proportional to @xmath2 , in the scale setting prescription of the coupling .",
    "the understanding of conformal symmetry and its breaking in perturbative qcd has been applied recently for the nlo calculation of the leading twist-2 wilson - coefficients @xcite and the flavor singlet evolution kernels @xcite relevant for off - forward processes as well as to prove the hypotheses of naive non - abelianzation for the renormalon chain appearing in the evolution kernel @xcite . in this paper",
    "we pursue the phenomenological consequences of the cs scheme for the exclusive processes mentioned above .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follow . in section [ scheme ]",
    "we discuss the scheme dependence of the perturbative corrections and argue that the nlo corrections calculated in the scheme should be reanalyzed in this special scheme that ensures conformal symmetry .",
    "the consequences of the blm scale fixing prescription and the evolution effects of the pseudo - scalar meson da to nlo are analyzed in the flavor nonsinglet sector in section [ nlo - da ] . in sections [ tff ] and [ ff ]",
    "we numerically investigate the nlo corrections for the photon - to - pion transition form factor and the elastic form factor , respectively , where we study quite different parametrizations of the pion da . applying the conformal operator product expansion , which is valid in the cs scheme , we are able to predict the photon - to - pion transition form factor to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) restricted to the conformal limit of the theory . at the moment evolution effects",
    "can not be taken into account at this order .",
    "conclusions are given in section [ concl ] .",
    "the decomposition and the conformal partial wave expansion of functions appearing in the hard - scattering part of the electromagnetic form factor are listed in two appendices .",
    "in ref .  @xcite we introduced the conformally covariant subtraction ( cs ) scheme , which ensures that the underlying conformal structure appearing in exclusive processes is manifest in the conformal limit .",
    "calculations of hard - scattering amplitudes and evolution kernels are carried out usually in the @xmath3 scheme .",
    "both schemes are related to each other by a ( finite ) refactorization .",
    "for instance , the photon - to - pion transition form factor @xmath4 at large momentum transfer factorizes in both schemes according to the standard factorization scheme ( sfa ) @xcite : @xmath5 where the hard - scattering part @xmath6 , depending on the kinematical variables @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the momentum fraction @xmath9 as well as the factorization scale @xmath10 , can be calculated in perturbation theory .",
    "the da @xmath11 satisfy the brodsky - lepage ( bl ) evolution equation @xcite : @xmath12 of course , the physical quantities are independent of the chosen scheme , which means that @xmath13 where the @xmath14 kernels satisfy @xmath15 the latter transformation implies that the evolution kernel of the da transforms inhomogeneously : @xmath16\\otimes b(z , y).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    perturbative qcd predictions for physical quantities are given as truncated series in @xmath17 .",
    "this necessary truncation induces their scheme dependence .",
    "the unknown higher order corrections may be minimized by choosing an appropriate scheme and scale .",
    "the problem of finding such an optimal renormalization scheme can be attacked with the help of the extended renormalization group equations introduced by stckelberg and peterman @xcite , which is equivalent to previous work given in refs.@xcite . to our best knowledge , no comparable methods were developed to find also the optimal factorization scheme . for",
    "a given process there may exist physical arguments to favour a special scheme .",
    "a further requirement should be that the factorization scheme respects the underlying symmetries of the theory , in order that no anomalous terms appear either in the hard - scattering part or in the bl evolution equation .",
    "the more restricted problem to find the optimal scale in a given scheme has been widely discussed in the literature and three quite distinct methods have been proposed : the principle of fastest apparent convergence ( fac ) @xcite , the principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms ) @xcite , and the brodsky - lepage - mackenzie ( blm ) @xcite scale setting .",
    "the application of these methods can yield quite different predictions ( see for instance the analyses in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "although conformal symmetry holds only true in the hypothetical conformal limit , it should be manifested in the maximally possible manner in the full theory . for exclusive processes",
    "in which only mesons participate such a factorization scheme is , up to the scale setting problem , uniquely defined in the conformal limit .",
    "however , as discussed above , also in the cs scheme anomalous terms proportional to the @xmath2-function are left and can not , as we will see below , be uniquely fixed . according to the blm scale setting prescription ,",
    "these anomalous terms can be absorbed in the scale setting of the coupling , and the perturbative series will be formally the same as in the conformal theory .",
    "motivated by our discussion it seems worthwhile to reexamine the known nlo corrections to exclusive processes in the cs scheme and to employ the blm prescription for the absorption of the remaining conformal anomalies .",
    "first we discuss the application of the blm scale fixing prescription in the evolution of the da . for the convenience of the reader we outline the whole formalism for the solution of the evolution equation ( [ evo - equ - mes ] ) in terms of the conformal partial wave expansion . using the @xmath18 scheme ,",
    "the evolution kernel @xmath19 was computed perturbatively in one- and two - loop approximation @xcite .",
    "the one - loop kernel is diagonal with respect to gegenbauer polynomials @xmath20 of order @xmath21 and with index @xmath22 . in the two - loop approximation",
    "this property is spoiled and because of the complicated structure , the moments @xmath23 where the normalization factor is @xmath24 , can not be directly calculated .",
    "fortunately , one can use conformal constraints to compute the off - diagonal moments in a very economical way @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the scheme the off - diagonal moments of the matrix @xmath25 are induced by a special conformal anomaly matrix @xmath26 and the running coupling @xcite : @xmath27=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the matrices @xmath28 and @xmath29 have the following elements : @xmath30 while the off - diagonal terms , induced by the renormalization of the coupling , are predicted by conformal constraints ( [ conf - constr - kd ] ) , the special conformal anomaly matrix @xmath26 contains new information . as explained in refs .",
    "@xcite , this anomaly matrix can be calculated directly with the help of modified feynman rules and it reads to leading order ( lo ) : @xmath31                              &                              \\mbox{and even}\\\\                               0      &    \\mbox{otherwise }                             \\end{array}\\right . , \\\\",

    "can be perturbatively solved to any order @xcite .",
    "note that the expectation values of the operators for odd @xmath21 vanish , which is indicated by the @xmath36 symbol .",
    "the evolution of the composite operators appearing in eq.([da - conspin - exp-4 ] ) is governed by the renormalization group equation ( rge ) , which possesses the following triangular form due to poincar invariance : @xmath37 the off - diagonal matrix elements @xmath38 ( with @xmath39 ) appear beyond the lo and are scheme dependent . in the @xmath40 scheme they can be simple obtained from eqs.([conf - constr - kd])([cwi - scbre2 ] ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that in the conformal limit of the theory the cs scheme ensures the conformal covariance of the renormalized operators and , therefore , their anomalous - dimension matrix is diagonal .",
    "the transformation to the cs scheme is determined by a matrix @xmath41 , which depends only on @xmath26 : @xmath42 where the operator @xmath43 is defined by @xmath44 this transformation cancels the off - diagonal part of @xmath45 , however , it induces an off - diagonal term proportional to the @xmath2-function : @xmath46\\hat{b}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , in this scheme the off - diagonal part of the anomalous - dimension matrix is proportional to the @xmath2-function : @xmath47    the blm scale setting prescription @xcite can now be applied to absorb the off - diagonal term ( [ rge - cs - offdiagonal ] ) into the scale dependence of the coupling : @xmath48.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , the off - diagonal term in nlo may be expressed as @xmath49 \\gamma^{(0)}_k+ \\cdots \\\\ & = & \\gamma_k(\\alpha_s(\\mu^\\ast_{kn}))-\\gamma_k(\\alpha_s(\\mu ) ) + \\cdots , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the new scale . to absorb the nnlo corrections in the analogous way ,",
    "it is necessary to introduce a different second scale @xmath51 and so on .",
    "after this procedure the rge ( [ rge - cs - blm ] ) in the cs scheme takes the form : @xmath52 o^{\\rm co}_{nl}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] all scales @xmath53 are uniquely determined by the conformal symmetry breaking term @xmath54 .",
    "this anomaly arises from two sources : ( i ) from the renormalization of the coupling constant that enters in the anomalous - dimension matrix and ( ii ) from the renormalization prescription in the cs scheme .    here",
    "one comment is in order .",
    "since the effects of arbitrary renormalization transformations proportional to the @xmath2 function will disappear in the conformal limit , the cs scheme can not be fixed in the full theory .",
    "below we will deal with two such cs schemes referred as @xmath55 and @xmath56 . in the first one only the off - diagonal part that is related to the special - conformal anomaly matrix",
    "will be removed by the transformation ( [ anodim - cs - ms ] ) , while in the @xmath56 scheme also the off - diagonal terms proportional to @xmath57 appearing in the anomalous dimensions are explicitly removed ( obviously , the inhomogeneous part in eq .",
    "( [ anodim - cs - ms ] ) can not be avoided , and finally terms proportional to @xmath57 appear ) .",
    "although the @xmath56 scheme induces an additional symmetry breaking term proportional to the @xmath2-function in the hard - scattering part , which looks artificial , it will be interesting to compare both cs schemes with each other .",
    "the evolution equation ( [ evo - equ - mes ] ) can be perturbatively solved with the help of the conformal spin expansion . solving the rge ( [ rge - cs-5 ] ) , which is an inhomogeneous partial first order differential equation , the solution has been written in a compact form in ref.@xcite and it is valid for an arbitrary scheme : @xmath58 the partial waves @xmath59 now contain perturbative corrections , which are induced by the off - diagonal anomalous dimension matrix .",
    "they are also known as expansion with respect to the gegenbauer polynomials @xmath60 the matrix @xmath61 diagonalizes the rge ( [ rge - cs-5 ] ) of the conformal operators and is given by @xmath62 where the operator @xmath63 is an integral operator acting on a triangular and off - diagonal matrix : @xmath64 \\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we do not include radiative corrections at the reference point @xmath65 , i.e. @xmath66 .",
    "notice that in general the matrix @xmath67 is different from the previously introduced matrix @xmath41 .      in the @xmath3 scheme",
    "the evolution of the da in nlo was analysed in detail in ref .",
    "the main feature showing up in this order is the excitation of higher harmonics due to the mixing of the operators , which yields logarithmic corrections in the end - point region .",
    "this logarithmical enhancement is hidden in the expansion of the partial waves , which is , corresponding to eqs.([sol - b - mixing])-([da - conspin - exp - cs - pw ] ) , given as @xmath68 the off - diagonal matrix @xmath69 is determined by the conformal anomalies and in the @xmath3 scheme it can be easily obtained from eq .",
    "( [ conf - constr - kd ] ) : @xmath70 here the matrices @xmath29 and @xmath71 are defined in eqs .",
    "( [ def - b ] ) and ( [ cwi - scbre2 ] ) , respectively .",
    "above we introduced two conformal schemes @xmath55 and @xmath56 which are obtained from the @xmath40 one by the transformations @xmath72 respectively . according to eq .",
    "( [ anodim - cs - ms ] ) these transformations imply that the off - diagonal part is @xmath73 [ see eq .",
    "( [ rge - cs - offdiagonal ] ) ] with @xmath74 @xmath75 can be absorbed via the blm scale setting prescription ; so that then the partial waves read @xmath76    finally , we study in the @xmath18 and in both cs schemes the scale dependence of the quantity @xmath77 which enters in different exclusive mesonic processes .",
    "for convenience we changed the normalization of the da , i.e. @xmath78 , where the pion decay constant is @xmath79 gev .",
    "notice that this integral was originally defined to lo ; here , however , it also contains the higher order effects caused by the evolution .",
    "it is very sensitive to the end - point behaviour of the da and , therefore , it may serve as a measure for the logarithmic corrections due to the evolution , which occur in this region @xcite .",
    "inserting the conformal spin expansion ( [ da - conspin - exp - cs - fin ] ) into the integral ( [ i - integral ] ) provides the representation @xmath80 which will be evaluated numerically by an appropriate truncation of the series . here",
    "the reduced matrix elements are the conformal moments of the da now normalized as : @xmath81 it is worthy to mention that in the cs schemes , the direct integration of the rg equation ( [ rge - cs - blm ] ) implies the following form : @xmath82 where @xmath83 depends on @xmath8 and @xmath65 : @xmath84 notice that in the conformal scheme @xmath56 a contribution of the form @xmath85 arises in the hard - scattering amplitudes , too .",
    "obviously , their expansion gives an @xmath17-suppressed term proportional to @xmath57 .",

    "<S> we apply the so - called conformal subtraction scheme to predict perturbatively exclusive processes beyond leading order . taking into account evolution effects </S>",
    "<S> , we study the scheme dependence for the photon - to - pion transition form factor and the electromagnetic pion form factor at next - to - leading order for different pion distribution amplitudes . relying on the conformally covariant operator product expansion and using the known higher order results for polarized deep inelastic scattering , we are able to predict perturbative corrections to the hard - scattering amplitude of the photon - to - pion transition form factor beyond next - to - leading order in the conformal scheme restricted to the conformal limit of the theory .    keywords :     exclusive processes , conformal symmetry , perturbative corrections ,     scheme dependence    pacs numbers : </S>"
