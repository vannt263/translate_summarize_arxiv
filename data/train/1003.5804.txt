    "synchronized behavior arising among the constituents of an ensemble is common in nature .",
    "examples include the synchronized flashing of fireflies , the blossoming of flowers , cardiac cells giving rise to the pacemaker role of the sinoatrial node of the heart and the electrical pulses of neurons",
    ". this global behavior can originate from a common response to an external stimulus or might appear in autonomous , non - forced , systems .",
    "the theoretical basis for the understanding of synchronization in non - forced systems was put forward by winfree ( @xcite ) who showed that the interaction i.e .",
    "coupling between the constituents is an essential ingredient for the existence of a synchronized output .",
    "the seminal work on coupled oscillators by kuramoto ( @xcite ) offered a model case whose solution confirms the basic hypothesis of winfree : while interaction helps towards the achievement of a common behavior , a perfect order can be achieved only in the absence of diversity heterogeneity among the components of an ensemble . in the kuramoto model ,",
    "diversity manifests when the oscillators have different natural frequencies , those they display when uncoupled from each other . while this result holds for systems that can be described by coupled oscillators ,",
    "recent results indicate that in other cases diversity among the constituents might actually have a positive role in the setting of a resonant behavior with an external signal .",
    "this was first demonstrated in ( @xcite ) and has been since extended to many other systems ( @xcite ) . in the case of non - forced excitable systems ,",
    "a unifying treatment of the role of noise and diversity has been developed in @xcite .",
    "many biological systems , including neurons , display excitability as a response to an external perturbation .",
    "excitability is characterized by the existence of a threshold , a largely independent response to a suprathreshold input and a refractory time .",
    "it is well established that the dynamical features of neurons can be described by excitable models : when a neuron is perturbed by a single impulse , the neuron can generate a single spike , and when perturbed by a continuum signal , a train of spikes with a characteristic firing frequency can appear instead .",
    "although the creation and propagation of electrical signals has been thoroughly studied by physiologists for at least a century , the most important landmark in this field is due to hodgkin and huxley ( @xcite ) , who developed the first quantitative model to describe the evolution of the membrane potential in the squid giant axon . because of the central importance of cellular electrical activity in biological systems and",
    "because this model forms the basis for the study of excitable systems , it remains to this date an important model for analysis .",
    "subsequently a simplified version of this model , known as the fitzhugh - nagumo ( fhn ) model ( @xcite ) , that captures many of the qualitative features of the hodgkin - huxley model was developed .",
    "the fhn model has two variables , one fast and one slow .",
    "the fast variable represents the evolution of the membrane potential and it is known as the excitation variable .",
    "the slow variable accounts for the @xmath0 ionic current and is known as the recovery variable .",
    "one virtue of this model is that it can be studied using phase - plane methods , because it is a two variable system .",
    "for instance , the fast variable has a cubic nullcline while the slow variable has a linear nullcline and the study of both nullclines and their intersections allow to determine the different dynamical regimes of the model .",
    "the fhn model can then be extended by coupling the individual elements , and provides an interesting model , for example , of coupled neuron populations .    in the initial studies of the dynamics of the fhn and similar models , the individual units ( e.g. neurons )",
    "were treated as identical .",
    "however , it is evident that real populations of neurons display a large degree of variability , both in morphology and dynamical activity ; that is , there is a diversity in the population of these biological units .",
    "then , it is natural to ask what role diversity plays in the global dynamical behavior of these systems and a lot of activity has been developed along these lines in the recent years . in general , it has been found , as noted above , that diversity can in fact be an important parameter in controlling the dynamics .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that both excitable and bistable systems can improve their response to an external stimulus if there is an adequate degree of diversity in the constituent units ( @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we continue our study of the effect of diversity , investigating in some depth its role in the fhn model of excitable systems .",
    "we consider in detail a system of many neurons coupled either chemically or electrically .",
    "we show that in both cases a right amount of diversity can indeed enhance the response to a periodic external stimulus and we discuss in detail the difference between the two types of coupling .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : model ] we present the fhn model and the coupling schemes considered .",
    "next , in section [ sec : results ] we present the main results we have obtained from numerical simulations .",
    "afterwards , in section [ sec : ope ] we develop an approximate theoretical treatment based on an order parameter expansion which allows us to obtain a quantitative description of the behavior of the model and compare its predictions with the numerical results . finally , in section",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we summarize the conclusions .",
    "let us consider a system of excitable neurons described by the fhn model .",
    "the dynamical equations describing the activity of a single neuron are : @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 represent , respectively , the fast membrane potential and the slow potassium gating variable of a neuron .",
    "we assume that the time scales of these variables are well separated by the small parameter @xmath4 .",

    "a convenient definition is that a spike appears when the membrane potential of the neuron exceeds a certain threshold value , e.g. @xmath17 . in the oscillatory regime , spikes appear spontaneously with an intrinsic firing frequency @xmath18 which , as shown in figure [ f0fhn ] ( b ) , does not depend much on the value of @xmath8 .    .",

    "we use @xmath34 as a measure of the heterogeneity of the system and , in the following , we use the value of @xmath34 as an indicator of the degree of diversity . if @xmath35 , all neurons have exactly the same set of parameters , while large values of @xmath34 indicate a large dispersion in the dynamical properties of individual neurons .    the most common way of communication between neurons is via chemical synapses , where the transmission is carried by an agent called neurotransmitter . in these synapses , neurons are separated by a synaptic cleft and the neurotransmitter has to diffuse to reach the post - synaptic receptors . in the chemical coupling case",

    "there is another type of synapse where the membranes of the neurons are in close contact and thus the transmission of the signal is achieved directly ( electrical synapses ) . in this case of electrically - mediated interactions , also known as diffusive coupling , the total synaptic current is proportional to the sum of the membrane potential difference between a neuron and its neighbors , and it is given by : @xmath55 the last ingredient of our model is the presence of an external forcing that acts upon all neurons simultaneously .",
    "although our results are very general , for the sake of concreteness we use a periodic forcing of amplitude @xmath56 and period @xmath57 .",
