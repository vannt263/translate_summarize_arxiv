    "in our recent paper @xcite we addressed the problem of formation of static charge - stripe phases in systems of correlated quantum particles . since an experimental evidence for the existence of striped phases in materials exhibiting high - temperature superconductivity has been gathered @xcite , one observes vigorous discussions of the problem of the stability of such phases in simple models of correlated electrons .",
    "mainly , some hubbard - like or @xmath1-like models are considered in this context ( see a review paper by ole @xcite ) . unfortunately",
    ", none of the methods applied for investigating these models enables one to control tiny energy differences between competing phases : the phase energies are calculated by means of uncontrolled approximations , moreover the results are biased by finite - size and boundary effects .",
    "in this situation , to get a deeper insight into the stability problem of striped phases , some simpler analogue problems @xcite have been studied .",
    "adopting such an approach , we have proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite a kind of an extended falicov  kimball model , whose ground - state phase diagram at the half - filling and at a sufficiently strong coupling is amenable to rigorous investigations  a rather exceptional situation in the field of correlated quantum - particle systems . from a technical point of view , the standard spinless falicov",
    " kimball model ( such as that studied in @xcite ) has been modified in order to allow for segregated phases , in the regime specified above .",
    "that is , the hamiltonian has been augmented by a direct , ising - like , nearest - neighbor ( n.n . )",
    "attractive interaction between the immobile particles .",
    "however from the point of view of crystallization problem , where the immobile particles are interpreted as ions @xcite , the added attractive interaction is a physically motivated supplement of the hardcore repulsion , which is already incorporated in the spinless falicov  kimball model .",
    "we have succeeded in proving that charge - stripe phases are stable in some domains of phase diagrams . by varying slightly the interaction parameter of the ising - like n.n .",
    "interaction , the system is driven from a crystalline ( chessboard ) phase to a segregated phase , via quasi - one - dimensional striped phases .    in our studies in ref .",
    "@xcite and in this paper , we have included also a subsidiary direct interaction between the immobile particles , an ising - like next nearest - neighbor ( n.n.n . ) interaction , much weaker than the n.n .",
    "this interaction can reinforce or frustrate the n.n .",
    "interaction , depending on the sign of its interaction constant .",
    "we find it useful in discussing similarities and differences between the cases of spinless fermions and hardcore bosons",
    ".    the obtained results on the stability of striped phases open new possibilities of investigating various characteristics of these phases . since",
    ", it is the role of a hopping anisotropy that has received a considerable attention in the recent literature of the subject @xcite , we have turned to this problem , and in this paper we discuss the role of a weak anisotropy of n.n . hopping .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in next section",
    "we define the model studied in this paper , describe symmetries of its grand - canonical phase diagrams , and introduce strong - coupling expansions of the ground - state energy ( effective hamiltonians ) and the corresponding phase diagrams .",
    "then , in section 3 , we carry out a detailed analysis of phase diagrams due to truncated effective hamiltonians of orders not exceeding four , in presence of a weak anisotropy of n.n . hopping . in section 4",
    ", we draw conclusions and provide a summary . various technical details",
    "a placed in appendices a , b , and c.",
    "the model to be studied is a simplified version of the one band , spin @xmath2 hubbard model , known as the static approximation ( one sort of electrons hops while the other sort is immobile ) , augmented by a direct ising - like interaction @xmath3 between the immobile particles .",
    "only a n.n .",
    "hopping is taken into account and we allow for its anisotropy .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the system reads :    @xmath4    in the above formulae , the underlying lattice is a square lattice , denoted @xmath5 , consisting of sites @xmath6 , whose number is @xmath7 , having the shape of a @xmath8 torus . in ( [ hfk],[v ] ) and below , the sums @xmath9 , or @xmath10 , @xmath11 , stand for the summation over all the @xmath12-th order n.n .",
    "pairs of lattice sites in @xmath5 , directed horizontally ( h ) or vertically ( v ) , with each pair counted once .    the subsystem of mobile spinless particles ( here - after called _ the electrons _ ) is described in terms of creation and annihilation operators of an electron at site @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , respectively , satisfying the canonical anticommutation relations ( spinless fermions ) or the commutation relations of spin @xmath2 operators @xmath16 ( hardcore bosons ) .",
    "the total electron - number operator is @xmath17 , and ( with a little abuse of notation ) the corresponding electron density is @xmath18 .",
    "there is no direct interaction between the mobile particles .",
    "their energy is due to the anisotropic hopping , with @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) being the n.n .",
    "horizontal ( vertical ) hopping intensity , and due to the interaction with the localized particles , whose strength is controlled by the coupling constant @xmath21 .    the hamiltonian @xmath22 is well - known as the hamiltonian of the spinless falicov ",
    "kimball model , a simplified version of the hamiltonian put forward in @xcite .",
    "a review of rigorous results concerning this model and an extensive list of relevant references can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "the subsystem of localized particles ( here - after called _ the ions _ ) , is described by a collection of pseudo - spins @xmath23 , with @xmath24 ( @xmath25 if the site @xmath13 is occupied by an ion and @xmath26 if it is empty ) , called the _",
    "ion configurations_. the total number of ions is @xmath27 and the ion density is @xmath28 . in our model",
    "the ions interact directly by means of the isotropic ising - like interaction @xmath3 .",
    "clearly , in the composite system , whose hamiltonian is given by ( [ h0 ] ) with an arbitrary electron - ion coupling @xmath21 , the particle - number operators @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and pseudo - spins @xmath31 , are conserved .",
    "therefore , the description of the classical subsystem in terms of the ion configurations @xmath32 remains valid .",
    "whenever periodic configurations of pseudo - spins are considered , it is assumed that @xmath5 is sufficiently large , so that it accommodates an integer number of elementary cells .      in what follows",
    ", we shall study the ground - state phase diagram of the system defined by ( [ h0 ] ) in the grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "that is , let @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 are the chemical potentials of the electrons and ions , respectively , and let @xmath36 be the ground - state energy of @xmath37 , for a given configuration @xmath38 of the ions . then , the ground - state energy of @xmath39 , @xmath40 , is defined as @xmath41 .",
    "the minimum is attained at the set @xmath42 of the ground - state configurations of ions .",
    "we shall determine the subsets of the space of the hamiltonian s energy parameters , where @xmath42 consists of periodic configurations of ions , uniformly in the size of the underlying square lattice .    in studies of grand - canonical phase diagrams",
    "an important role is played by unitary transformations ( _ hole  particle transformations _ ) that exchange particles and holes , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and for some @xmath45 leave the hamiltonian @xmath46 invariant . for the mobile particles",
    "such a role is played by the transformations : @xmath47 , where @xmath48 for bosons while for fermions @xmath48 at the even sublattice of @xmath5 and @xmath49 at the odd one . clearly , since @xmath50 is invariant under the joint hole ",
    "particle transformation of mobile and localized particles , @xmath39 is hole ",
    "particle invariant at the point @xmath51 . at the hole ",
    "particle symmetry point , the system under consideration has very special properties , which simplify studies of its phase diagram @xcite .",
    "moreover , by means of the defined above hole - particle transformations one can determine a number of symmetries of the grand - canonical phase diagram @xcite .",
    "the peculiarity of the model is that the case of attraction ( @xmath52 ) and the case of repulsion ( @xmath53 ) are related by a unitary transformation ( the hole - particle transformation for ions ) : if @xmath54 is a ground - state configuration at @xmath55 for @xmath53 , then @xmath56 is the ground - state configuration at @xmath57 for @xmath52 . consequently , without any loss of generality one can fix the sign of the coupling constant @xmath21 . moreover",
    "( with the sign of @xmath21 fixed ) , there is an _ inversion symmetry _ of the grand - canonical phase diagram , that is , if @xmath38 is a ground - state configuration at @xmath58 , then @xmath59 is the ground - state configuration at @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , it is enough to determine the phase diagram in a half - plane specified by fixing the sign of one of the chemical potentials .",
    "our aim in this paper is to investigate the ground - state phase diagrams of our systems , for general values of the energy parameters that appear in @xmath46 . according to the state of art ,",
    "this is feasible only in the _ strong - coupling regime _ ,",
    "i.e. when @xmath61 is sufficiently small .",
    "therefore , from now on we shall consider exclusively the case of a large positive coupling @xmath21 , and we express all the parameters of @xmath46 in the units of @xmath21 , preserving the previous notation .      in the strong - coupling regime , the ground - state energy @xmath62 can be expanded in a power series in @xmath63 .",
    "one of the ways to achieve this , for fermions and for hardcore bosons , is a method of unitarily equivalent interactions @xcite .",
    "the result , with the expansion terms up to order four shown explicitly , reads :    @xmath64 \\sum\\limits_{\\langle x , y \\rangle_{1,h } } s_{x}s_{y } \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\left [ \\gamma \\frac{t^{2}}{4 } -\\frac{3}{8}\\gamma t^{4 } - \\gamma^{2}\\frac{3t^{4}}{16 } + \\frac{w}{8 } \\right ] \\sum\\limits_{\\langle x , y \\rangle_{1,v } } s_{x}s_{y}+ \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\left [ \\gamma \\frac{3t^{4}}{16}-\\frac{\\tilde{\\varepsilon}}{16 } \\right ] \\sum\\limits_{\\langle x , y \\rangle_{2 } } s_{x}s_{y } + \\frac{t^{4}}{8 } \\sum\\limits_{\\langle x , y \\rangle_{3,h } } s_{x}s_{y}+ \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\gamma^{2 } \\frac{t^{4}}{8 } \\sum\\limits_{\\langle x , y \\rangle_{3,v } } s_{x}s_{y } + \\gamma \\frac{t^{4}}{16 } \\sum\\limits_{p } \\left(1 + 5s_{p}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the case of hopping fermions , and @xmath65 \\sum\\limits_{\\langle x , y \\rangle_{1,h } } s_{x}s_{y } + \\nonumber \\\\ & + &   \\left [ \\gamma \\frac{t^{2}}{4 } -\\frac{1}{8}\\gamma t^{4 } - \\gamma^{2}\\frac{3t^{4}}{16 } + \\frac{w}{8 } \\right ] \\sum\\limits_{\\langle x , y \\rangle_{1,v } } s_{x}s_{y}+ \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\left [ \\gamma \\frac{5t^{4}}{16}-\\frac{\\tilde{\\varepsilon}}{16 } \\right ] \\sum\\limits_{\\langle x , y \\rangle_{2 } } s_{x}s_{y } + \\frac{t^{4}}{8 } \\sum\\limits_{\\langle x , y \\rangle_{3,h } } s_{x}s_{y } + \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\gamma^{2 } \\frac{t^{4}}{8 } \\sum\\limits_{\\langle x , y \\rangle_{3,v } } s_{x}s_{y } - \\gamma \\frac{t^{4}}{16 } \\sum\\limits_{p } \\left(5+s_{p}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the case of hopping hardcore bosons .",
    "the both of the above expressions are given up to a term independent of the ion configurations and the chemical potentials . in ( [ expfmn ] ) and ( [ exphcb ] ) , we have set @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , with @xmath68 , @xmath69 denotes a @xmath70-sites plaquette of the square lattice @xmath5 , @xmath71 stands for the product of pseudo - spins assigned to the corners of @xmath69 .",
    "the remainders , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which are independent of the chemical potentials and the parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 , but dependent on @xmath76 , collect those terms of the expansions that are proportional to @xmath77 , with @xmath78 .",
    "it can be proved that the above expansions are absolutely convergent , uniformly in @xmath5 , provided that @xmath79 and @xmath80 @xcite . moreover ,",
    "under these conditions the ground - state densities of particles satisfy the half - filling relation : @xmath81 .",
    "we note that on taking into account the inversion symmetry of the phase diagram in the @xmath55-plane and the fact that the ground - state energies depend only on the difference of the chemical potentials , in order to determine the phase diagram in the stripe @xmath82 it is enough to consider the phase diagram at the half - line @xmath83 , @xmath84 ( or @xmath85 ) . at this half - line",
    "we set @xmath86 .",
    "due to the convergence of the expansions ( [ expfmn ] ) and ( [ exphcb ] ) , it is possible to establish rigorously a part of the phase diagram , that is the ground - state configurations of ions are determined in the space of the hamiltonian s energy parameters everywhere , except some small regions .",
    "this is accomplished by determining the ground - state phase diagram of the expansion truncated at the order @xmath87 ( _ the k - th order phase diagram _ ) , that is according to the @xmath87-th order effective hamiltonians @xmath88 and @xmath89 . the remainder of the expansion , that consists of a term of the next order , @xmath90 , and other higher - order terms , can not modify the obtained phase diagram , except some narrow regions along the phase boundaries whose width is of the order @xmath91 .",
    "the procedure of constructing the phase diagram is recursive : the phase diagram of the effective interaction truncated at the order @xmath91 is constructed on the basis of the phase diagram obtained at the preceding order @xmath87 : the conditions imposed on the ground - state configurations by the @xmath87-th order effective hamiltonian have to be obeyed by the ground - state configurations of the @xmath91-th order effective hamiltonian . in other words ,",
    "the @xmath91-th order terms of the expansion can not change the hierarchy of configuration s energies established by the @xmath87-th order effective hamiltonian ; they can only split the energies of configurations in cases of degeneracy . at each step of the construction",
    ", we use the @xmath92-potential method introduced in @xcite , with technical developments described in @xcite . for details specific to this paper",
    "see also ref.@xcite and appendix a.    in ref.@xcite we have obtained the ground - state phase diagrams , according to the fourth - order isotropic effective hamiltonians @xmath93 and @xmath94 , for hole - particle symmetric systems ( @xmath95 ) with a weak ( of fourth order ) n.n.n .",
    "subsidiary interaction , and for unsymmetrical systems without the subsidiary interaction ( @xmath96 ) , see the top phase diagrams in figs .",
    "[ sppd],[epspdf],[epspdb ] .",
    "second - order phase diagrams of ref.@xcite consist exclusively of phases whose configurations are invariant with respect to @xmath0-rotations , with _ macroscopic degeneracies _",
    "( i.e. the number of configurations grows exponentially with the number of sites ) at the boundaries of phase domains .",
    "stripe phases , whose configurations are not invariant with respect to @xmath0-rotations , appear on perturbing the second - order phase diagrams by the fourth - order isotropic interactions . here , we would like to observe the influence of a weak anisotropy of n.n . hopping on these stripe phases .",
    "since we are working with truncated effective hamiltonians , we have to assign an order to the deviation of the anisotropy parameter @xmath76 from the value @xmath97 ( corresponding to the isotropic case ) .",
    "therefore , we introduce an anisotropy order , @xmath98 , and a new anisotropy parameter , @xmath99 : @xmath100 the orders of the deviations can be neither too small , not to modify the second - order effective hamiltonians , nor too high , to effect the considered effective hamiltonian of the highest order . since here , the highest order of the effective hamiltonians is @xmath101 , the weakest admissible deviation from the isotropic case corresponds to the highest anisotropy order @xmath102 .",
    "then , we can consider an intermediate deviation , i.e. @xmath103 . the strongest deviation , i.e. @xmath104 , is not admissible , since it modifies the second - order effective hamiltonians .      in the sequel , we drop the arguments of ground - state energies , that is we set @xmath105 , etc . in the case of the smallest deviation from the isotropic case",
    "the fourth - order effective hamiltonian for fermions reads : @xmath106 while for hardcore bosons only the first term , representing the isotropic fourth - order effective hamiltonian , has to be changed properly .    apparently , the effective hamiltonians of order zero and two are isotropic , and there is no difference between the cases of hopping fermions and hopping bosons .",
    "the corresponding phase diagrams , determined in ref.@xcite , are built of three _ phases _ , i.e. sets of configurations with the same energy in some open regions of phase diagrams , called _ phase domains _",

    "now , to observe the effect of the fourth - order anisotropy term of ( [ e4sd ] ) the construction of the fourth - order diagrams has to be carried out again .",
    "as in the isotropic case , this is facilitated by introducing new variables , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 : @xmath115 and rewriting the fourth order effective hamiltonian in the form , @xmath116 where @xmath117 with analogous expressions in the bosonic case , and with the isotropic potentials @xmath118 , @xmath119 given by @xmath120 @xmath121    in the above formulae @xmath122 stands for a @xmath123-sites plaquette of a square lattice , later on called _ the @xmath122-plaquette _ , and @xmath124 stands for the central site of a @xmath122-plaquette .",

    "we would like to get an idea of the phase diagram in the space of the four energy parameters @xmath125 , that appear in the hamiltonian . due to the fact that the domains occupied by the phases are polyhedral sets ( see appendix a ) , this goal can be achieved by studying phase diagrams in two - dimensional hyperplanes .",
    "of particular interest are those hyperplanes that result from intersecting the four - dimensional space by hyperplanes @xmath126 and @xmath127 , and by hyperplanes @xmath128 and @xmath127 .",
    "a collection of such sections for suitable values of @xmath129 , forming a finite increasing from zero sequence , enable us to observe how the anisotropy effects our system if it is hole - particle symmetric and if it is not , respectively .",

    "therefore , we conclude that in the case of the weakest anisotropy in the fourth - order effective hamiltonians , we have determined all the critical values of the anisotropy parameter @xmath129 . for the both kinds of hopping particles ,",
    "if @xmath129 exceeds the greatest critical value , the obtained phase diagram undergoes only a translation ( varying with @xmath129 ) .",
    "now , the basic question to be answered is concerned with the relation between these fourth - order phase diagrams and the phase diagrams of quantum systems described by hamiltonians @xmath50 . by adapting the arguments presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , we can demonstrate , see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite , that if the remainders , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , are taken into account , then there is a sufficiently small @xmath218 such that for @xmath219 the phase diagrams of quantum systems look the same as the phase diagrams according to the effective hamiltonians truncated at the fourth order , except some narrow regions , of width @xmath220 ( at the diagrams displayed above ) , located along the phase - domains boundaries , and except the domains @xmath166 and @xmath169 . for @xmath219 and for each domain @xmath221 , which is different from @xmath166 and @xmath169 , there is a nonempty two - dimensional open domain @xmath222 that is contained in the domain @xmath221 and such that in @xmath222 the set of ground - state configurations coincides with @xmath221 .",
    "moreover , in comparison with the critical values of the anisotropy parameter @xmath129 , determined according to the fourth - order effective hamiltonians , the corresponding critical values of the quantum systems described by hamiltonians @xmath50 differ by @xmath220 , i.e. for a quantum system @xmath223 .",
    "remarkably , in the fourth - order the hole - particle symmetric phase diagrams of fermions and of hardcore bosons are geometrically similar .",
    "that is , a phase diagram of hard core bosons , with any @xmath224 , can be obtained from a phase diagram of fermions , with @xmath225 , by the translation whose vector reads : @xmath226 , @xmath227 , and @xmath228 . the existence of this translation vector is related to the fact that for both kinds of systems there is one critical value of the anisotropy parameter .",
    "additionally , for fermions with @xmath229 , it is necessary to replace the phase @xmath142 in the central domain by @xmath139 . off the hole - particle symmetry ,",
    "the relation between the bosonic and fermionic phase diagrams is not that close . for fermions",
    ", there are three critical values of @xmath129 , while for hardcore bosons there is no critical values .",
    "thus , the system with hopping hardcore bosons is less sensitive to the anisotropy of hopping , than the system with hopping fermions .",
    "nevertheless , if @xmath230 , then the phase diagrams of both kinds of systems are topologically similar , except that in the bosonic phase diagrams the phases @xmath231 and @xmath232 are missing . however ,",
    "we know from ref .  @xcite that this deficiency can be removed by switching on the n.n.n .",
    "interactions with negative @xmath114 .    in the fourth - order effective hamiltonians ( [ e4sd ] ) , the weakest anisotropy of n.n .",
    "hopping assumes the form of a fourth - order attractive n.n .",
    "interaction in vertical direction ( i.e. the direction of a weaker hopping ) .",
    "this interaction favors n.n pairs of occupied or empty sites that are oriented vertically . as a result , the dimeric and axial - stripe phases oriented",
    "vertically are stabilized for any value of the anisotropy parameter @xmath129 , while @xmath139 and @xmath142 are replaced by @xmath233 above a critical value of @xmath129 .",
    "note however , that at any higher order @xmath234 , @xmath235 the weakest anisotropy of n.n .",
    "hopping will cause the same effects , in the effective hamiltonians as well as in the corresponding phase diagrams .",
    "this implies that in the quantum systems described by @xmath236 , any anisotropy of n.n .",
    "hopping orients the dimeric and axial - stripe phases in the direction of a weaker hopping .",
    "we have considered two systems of correlated quantum particles , described by extended falicov - kimball hamiltonians , with the hopping particles being either spinless fermions or hardcore bosons .",
    "the both system have been studied in the regime of strong coupling and half - filling , where the stability of some charge - stripe phases can be proved @xcite .",
    "two main conclusions have been drawn .",
    "firstly , any anisotropy of nearest - neighbor hopping orients the dimeric and axial - stripe phases in the direction of a weaker hopping .",
    "secondly , even a weak anisotropy of hopping reveals a tendency of fermionic phase diagrams to become similar to the bosonic ones .",
