    "the recent discovery  @xcite at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) of a higgs boson with mass around 125 and other properties consistent with the expectations of the standard model  ( sm ) serves as yet another confirmation that it is a remarkably successful theory .",
    "nevertheless , it is widely believed that new physics beyond it is still necessary at least to account for the compelling experimental evidence for neutrino mass and the astronomical indications of dark matter @xcite .    among a great many possibilities beyond the sm",
    "are those with enlarged scalar sectors .",
    "scenarios incorporating a second higgs doublet are of course highly popular in the literature @xcite . of late models with three scalar weak doublets",
    "have also been gaining interest @xcite , as they can provide dark matter ( dm ) candidates @xcite and/or an important ingredient for the mechanism that generates neutrino mass @xcite .",
    "here we consider this three - scalar - doublet possibility , particularly that in which two of the doublets possess zero vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) .",
    "the theory also involves a new abelian gauge symmetry under which these two doublets are charged , while sm particles are not . as a consequence",
    ", the extra scalar particles do not couple directly to a pair of exclusively sm fermions .",
    "because of the absence of their vevs and couplings to sm fermion pairs , these scalars have been termed inert in the literature  @xcite . however , being members of weak doublets , these scalars have interactions with sm gauge bosons at tree level .",
    "in addition , the gauge boson associated with the new gauge group is taken to have vanishing kinetic mixing with the hypercharge gauge boson . accordingly",
    ", the additional gauge sector can be regarded as dark .    with these choices , the scalar sector of the theory corresponds to one of the three - scalar - doublet models catalogued and studied in ref .",
    "@xcite in terms of all possible allowed symmetries . in the present paper ,",
    "we entertain the scenario described above and explore some implications of the presence of the inert scalars .",
    "specifically , we analyze constraints on them from collider measurements on the higgs boson and from electroweak precision data .",
    "in addition , we look at the potential impact of the scalars on the higgs trilinear self - coupling , anticipating future experiments that will probe it sufficiently well . to evaluate the coupling , we will employ the higgs effective potential derived at the one - loop level .",
    "moreover , we examine how the new particles , which we choose to have sub - tev masses , may give rise to strongly first - order electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) , which is needed for electroweak baryogenesis to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "as it has been pointed out in the context of other models that the strength of ewpt could be correlated with sizable modifications to the higgs trilinear self - coupling  @xcite , our results will indicate how this may be realized in the presence of the new doublets .    due to their tree - level interactions with sm gauge and higgs bosons",
    ", the lightest of the inert scalars can not serve as good candidates for dm , as they annihilate into sm particles too fast and hence can not produce enough relic abundance . to account for dm , one needs to have a more complete theory , but we assume that the additional ingredients responsible for explaining dm have negligible or no impact on our scalar sector of interest , so that they do not affect the results of this paper .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the scalar lagrangian and address some theoretical constraints on its parameters , especially from the requirements on vacuum stability .",
    "since the extra scalar doublets couple to the standard higgs and gauge bosons and include electrically - charged members , they contribute at the one - loop level to the higgs decays @xmath1  and @xmath2  which have been under intense investigation at the lhc , the former channel having also been observed .",
    "we determine their rates in section [ hcons ] , where we also start our numerical analysis by exploring the charged scalars impact on these processes . in section [ ewpconstraints ] , we calculate the contributions of the new doublets to the oblique electroweak observables @xmath3 and  @xmath4 , on which experimental information is available .",
    "sections [ thc ] and [ ewpt ] contain our treatment of the new scalars effects on the trilinear higgs couplings and on the electroweak phase transition , respectively . after deriving the relevant formulas ,",
    "we perform further numerical work in these sections . in section [ concl ] , we discuss additional results and make our conclusions after combining different relevant constraints .",
    "a  few appendices contain more discussions and formulas .",
    "alternatively , instead of @xmath48 , one can choose to deal with their real and imaginary parts , @xmath49 which are @xmath50-even and @xmath50-odd states , respectively , and share mass , @xmath51 .",

    ", it follows that the decay modes @xmath80 , if kinematically allowed , contribute at tree level to the total width of the higgs boson and are the leading channels into nonstandard final states in the model .",
    "their rates have the form @xmath81 where @xmath82 the combined branching ratio of these decays is @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the sm higgs total width and only channels satisfying @xmath85 contribute to the sums .",

    "the potential impact of the inert scalars can also be realized through loop diagrams . of much interest",

    "this also makes the bound from the data on the higgs invisible / nonstandard decay irrelevant .",
    "since the new scalars couple directly to the higgs boson , their presence can cause its trilinear self - coupling , @xmath121 , to shift from its sm prediction .",
    "such a modification could translate into detectable collider signatures , especially at a future @xmath73 machine such as the international linear collider @xcite where the coupling can be measured with 20% precision or better at a center - of - mass energy @xmath122 if the integrated luminosity is @xmath123 .    to derive the formula for the mass - dimension higgs trilinear self - coupling in the presence of extra heavy particles , we follow the steps taken in ref .  @xcite .",

    "( [ lhhh ] ) and appendix [ masses ] , the higgs trilinear self - coupling is a function of the couplings @xmath155 and @xmath156 of the inert neutral and charged scalars , respectively , to the sm higgs doublet , i.e. through the field - dependent masses and their derivatives . since @xmath157 are related to the scalars physical masses via eqs .",

    "it is clear that in the presence of the inert doublets the trilinear higgs self - coupling can be enhanced or reduced by up to roughly 150% relative to the sm contribution to it .",
    "one realizes that , for either large or small ( charged and/or neutral ) scalar masses and couplings to the sm higgs doublet , this enhancement or reduction of the trilinear coupling is the effect of the superposition of different contributions which could be constructive or destructive .",

    "we remark that the higgs quartic self - coupling , which at tree level is defined by the higgs mass , can have a  wide range from about @xmath166 to @xmath167 .",
    "this is due to the fact that much of the higgs mass arises radiatively , as the right plot in figure  [ hhh ] indicates .",
    "more precisely , @xmath168 can be fully radiative for small @xmath150 values or get a  negative radiative correction for large @xmath150 values , those greater than its tree - level one ,  @xmath169 .",
    "one can see from the top - left and bottom plots in the figure that similar remarks could be made concerning @xmath121 and @xmath170 .",
    "in particular , each of these parameters may be fully radiative for small @xmath150 and also can receive radiative corrections which are negative .",
    "it is well - known that one of the reasons why the sm fails to produce successful baryogenesis @xcite is the fact that the ewpt is not strong and consequently can not suppress processes that violate the conservation of baryon plus lepton numbers , @xmath14+@xmath171 , in the broken phase @xcite .",
    "the suppression of anomalous @xmath14+@xmath171-violating processes in the broken phase happens if the criterion for strongly first - order ewpt @xcite , @xmath172 is fulfilled , where @xmath173 is the higgs vev at the critical temperature @xmath174 at which the effective potential exhibits two degenerate minima , one at zero and the other at @xmath173 . both @xmath174 and @xmath173",

    "one performs the resummation of an infinite class of infrared - divergent multiloops diagrams , known as ring diagrams , that describes the dominant contribution of long distances and gives a significant contribution when ( almost ) massless states appear in the system . in our case , we will include this by following another approach . rather than adding @xmath179 to  @xmath177",

    "( [ v / t ] ) , the critical temperature @xmath174 is the value at which the two minima of the effective potential are degenerate , @xmath183 in the sm , this leads to a higgs mass below 42 @xcite , since the ratio @xmath184 is inversely proportional to the higgs quartic coupling @xmath150 .",
    "the strength of the ewpt can be improved if new bosonic degrees of freedom are invoked  @xcite , which is the case we are investigating .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ mh2 ] ) that for large values of the couplings and/or masses of the extra scalars , the one - loop corrections to the higgs mass could be significant , which allows @xmath185 to be smaller and , therefore , fulfills the criterion in eq .",

    "however , in order to take into account the effect of all the ( heavy and light ) degrees of freedom , we will evaluate them numerically .    with the same 5000 benchmark points used previously , in figure  [ vctc ] we present @xmath184 as a function of @xmath174 and of the higgs quartic self - coupling .",
    "it is obvious that the criterion for a strongly first - order ewpt is easily satisfied for a large number of benchmarks .",
    "moreover , we find that the daisy contribution to the effective potential tends to weaken the ewpt strength in this setup .",
    "one also notices that a strong ewpt can be obtained for different values of the higgs quartic self - coupling @xmath185 , as shown in the right panel of figure  [ vctc ] , even for values larger than the tree - level one , @xmath169 .",
    "this leads us to conclude that the ewpt is always strongly first - order due the reason ( b ) mentioned above , where the extra heavy scalars existence makes the higgs vev slowly varying with respect to temperature and the wrong vacuum value , i.e. @xmath188 , is evolving and increases with temperature .",
    "we remark that due to the absence of a @xmath50-violating phase in the potential @xmath30 an additional source of @xmath50 violation has to be included in the lagrangian of the more complete theory for it to be realistic for baryogensis .",
    "one possibility is to introduce dimension - six operators which couple the inert scalars to the top - quark mass and are suppressed by a new - physics scale that can be well above one , in analogy to a  scenario of electroweak baryogenesis from a singlet scalar @xcite .",
    "according to the analysis carried out in previous sections , the extra scalars can have important effects on the higgs phenomenology and the electroweak phase transition if these particles are relatively light and the couplings to the sm higgs doublet are large ( @xmath156 for charged scalars and @xmath155 for neutral ones ) .",
    "therefore , from the 5000 benchmark points used previously , we extract those that simultaneously satisfy ( i )  the constraint from the measurements on the higgs decay mode @xmath1 , namely @xmath189 , ( ii )  the electroweak precision tests , i.e. all the points inside the three ellipsoids in figure  [ ob ] , and ( iii )  the criterion @xmath190 for strongly first - order  ewpt . as mentioned in section  [ ewpconstraints ] , the higgs decay channel into a pair of inert scalars is closed for all the viable benchmarks and hence its experimental bound is not relevant . here , we divide the points fulfilling the conditions ( i , ii , iii ) into three sets according to the ellipsoid to which they belong on the @xmath120 plane .",
