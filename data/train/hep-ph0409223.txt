    "recently , the model building along with the tev - scale extra dimension scenario  @xcite has been widely surveyed .",
    "the gauge theories with extra dimensions have remarkable features . since the number of the kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes which is the source of the attractive force increases explosively in high - energy , the bulk gauge couplings grow very quickly and get strong .",
    "therefore the bulk gauge theories can naturally trigger the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( d@xmath1sb ) .",
    "@xcite    the top quark condensate  @xcite , which is often called the `` top mode standard model '' ( tmsm ) , has been also reexamined in the context of extra dimensions  @xcite . in particular , arkani - hamed , cheng , dobrescu and hall ( acdh )  @xcite proposed a version of the tmsm where the third generation quarks and leptons as well as the the standard model ( sm ) gauge bosons are put in the bulk , while any four - fermion interactions are not introduced in the bulk unlike the original version of the tmsm in four dimensions . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the full bulk gauge dynamics was investigated , based on the ladder schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equation .",
    "the phenomenological implications were studied in ref .",
    "it is found that the model with @xmath2 can be viable and both masses of the top quark and higgs boson are predicted as @xmath3 gev and @xmath4 gev , respectively .",
    "however it turns out that _ the simplest scenario with @xmath5 does not work . _    on the other hand , it is known that field theories in six dimensions have several interesting features relating to proton stability  @xcite , explanation of the number of the generations of fermions  @xcite , etc .. in order to construct a viable top - condensate model in six dimensions , we may introduce the four - fermion interaction in the bulk .",
    "in other words , one of possibilities is the model building based on the gauged nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model which is defined as the gauge theory with four - fermion interactions .",
    "the phase structure of such a gauged njl model in the bulk was analyzed in ref .",
    "another possibility is to introduce a strong gauge interaction such as topcolor in the bulk .",
    "topcolor models in four dimensions have been extensively studied .",
    "@xcite ( see for reviews refs .  @xcite . )",
    "the top seesaw mechanism can be realized by introducing five dimensional right - handed top quark .",
    "@xcite    the topcolor should be broken down in low energy . in four dimensions ,",
    "however , it is required to introduce some involved dynamical mechanism in order to break the topcolor , unless a ( composite ) scalar field is introduced for simplicity . as for the gauge symmetry breaking , the extra dimension scenario has an advantage as well .",
    "it is known that the gauge symmetry breaking can be easily achieved in extra dimensions by imposing appropriate boundary conditions ( bc s ) .",
    "@xcite on the basis of more general bc s , the higgsless theory was proposed  @xcite and has been investigated by a number of authors  @xcite .",
    "although it may be difficult to construct higgsless models consistent with the precision measurements , the gauge symmetry breaking mechanism via nontrivial bc s can be also applied to other models for the dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "such an attempt has not yet been discussed so far .    a topcolor model with nontrivial bc s obviously has some advantages : we do not need to incorporate a dynamical mechanism for the topcolor breaking .",
    "we can break spontaneously the topcolor gauge symmetry without introducing _ explicitly _ a ( composite ) scalar field .",
    "we note here , however , that such a model has implicitly a scalar field on the boundary . in a sense , a theory with nontrivial bc s is equivalent to a model having a scalar field with a large vacuum expectation value ( vev ) which is put on the boundary . in the infinite limit of the vev the scalar field",
    "is completely decoupled and hence the kk masses of the gauge boson are controlled only by the compactification scale .",
    "therefore , we can neglect thoroughly such a scalar field . in passing ,",
    "the topcolor gauge bosons do not have mass terms in the bulk in the gauge breaking mechanism via the bc s .",
    "the theory thus does not provide four - fermion ( njl - type ) interactions in the bulk , unlike four dimensional topcolor models .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the topcolor breaking via nontrivial bc s in six dimensions .",
    "we assign the topcolor charge , @xmath6 , to the top and bottom quarks in the bulk .",
    "the quarks of the first and second generations in the bulk are assumed to have the @xmath7 charge .",
    "we then impose the nontrivial bc s so that @xmath8 breaks down to the diagonal subgroup , which is identified to qcd .",
    "we also put the electroweak ( ew ) gauge interaction in the bulk .",
    "the ew gauge sector is the same as the universal extra dimension model  @xcite with the composite higgs field . in order to obtain the chiral fermion in four dimensions , we apply the compactification on a square proposed by dobrescu and pontn  @xcite , which is closely related to the compactification on the orbifold @xmath9 .    for a viable model",
    "it is required that only the top condensation occurs while other condensations such as bottom and leptons do not .",
    "we call the requirement `` tmac condition '' and the energy scale `` tmac scale '' as in ref .  @xcite .",
    "once we specify the model , the renormalization group ( rg ) flows of the gauge couplings can be determined through the truncated kk effective theory  @xcite .",
    "the running effects are very important to study the tmac scale .",
    "we here note that the bulk hypercharge interaction @xmath0 rapidly becomes strong owing to the power - like running .",
    "thus the @xmath10 tilting mechanism to suppress the bottom quark condensation is automatically incorporated in the model .",
    "the difference of the gauge coupling strengths between @xmath6 and @xmath7 leads to suppression of the up- , and charm - condensations .",
    "when the theory behaves as a walking gauge theory  @xcite and the gauge coupling of @xmath6 is very close to the critical coupling for the d@xmath1sb , the situation that only the top quark condenses is naturally realized .",
    "we analyze the tmac scale by using the ladder sd equation and depict the results in two dimensional plane of the cutoff @xmath11 and the ratio of the topcolor and qcd couplings @xmath12 at the compactification scale @xmath13 . for a slice @xmath14 , for example",

    "<S> the nontrivial boundary conditions ( bc s ) for the topcolor breaking are investigated in the context of the tev - scale extra dimension scenario . in the gauge symmetry breaking mechanism via the bc s we do not need to incorporate a dynamical mechanism for the topcolor breaking into the model . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the topcolor breaking can be realized without introducing explicitly a ( composite ) scalar field . </S>",
    "<S> we present a six dimensional model where the top and bottom quarks in the bulk have the topcolor charge while the other quarks in the bulk do not . </S>",
    "<S> we also put the electroweak gauge interaction in the six dimensional bulk . </S>",
    "<S> the bottom quark condensation is naturally suppressed owing to the power - like running of the bulk @xmath0 interaction , so that only the top condensation is expected to take place . </S>",
    "<S> we explore such a possibility based on the ladder schwinger - dyson equation and show the cutoff to make the model viable . </S>"
