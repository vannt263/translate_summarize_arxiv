    "recently , with the advent of nanotechnology great interest and effort have been devoted to the study of decoherence in nano - systems that arises from their coupling to the environment  @xcite . due to their small sizes and",
    "consequently reduced number of degrees of freedom this is a fundamental feature which is going to determine their properties and eventual applications . equally important is to understand the behavior of these nano materials under the action of external time dependent perturbations .",
    "it turns out however that even in macroscopic many - body systems , the effects of dissipation and time dependent perturbations are extremely interesting and important to investigate . these perturbations can radically modify the phase diagram of macroscopic systems , both at zero and finite temperatures .",
    "an important and actual question concerns the nature of the phase transitions in nonequilibrium systems , both classical and quantum . in the quantum case , due to the entanglement of time and space dimensions , including dissipation is sometimes essential to give a correct description of the quantum critical phenomena .",
    "the most common example is that of magnetic quantum phase transitions in metals where the magnetic order parameter couples dynamically in a dissipative way to low energy particle - hole excitations  @xcite .",
    "while the mathematical treatment of dissipation may be involved , sometimes requiring a numerical approach  @xcite , it can be done with the usual methods of equilibrium problems . on the other hand ,",
    "when considering the effect of external time dependent perturbations , beyond the regime of linear response , one has to appeal for more unconventional mathematical approaches to deal with the nonequilibrium situation , even in steady state . in this case",
    "there is a breakdown of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem  @xcite due to the explicit time dependence of the parameters in the hamiltonian describing the system  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the effects of dissipation and of a time dependent vector potential in the phase diagram of a superconducting material  @xcite . to be specific , we focus on a system consisting of a superconducting layer under the action of an external electric field that arises from a time dependent vector potential that acts exclusively in the layer .",
    "the latter is coupled to a metallic substrate that represents a source of dissipation and allows for the perturbed system to attain a nonequilibrium , time independent situation .",
    "the microscopic mechanism for dissipation is the transfer of electrons between the two systems  @xcite , the same type of coupling which gives rise to the proximity effect .",
    "we use a nonequilibrium keldysh approach and develop a formalism that allows to obtain the time dependence of the superconducting order parameter , for an arbitrary time dependence of the vector potential , under an adiabatic condition .",
    "our method does not resort to the time dependent landau - guinzburg equation neither to boltzmann\"s equation . in this paper , besides introducing the method  @xcite , we will be mainly concerned with the phase diagram of the superconducting layer , as modified by dissipation and the electric field .",
    "we find that for sufficiently large dissipation and electric field superconductivity in the layer is destroyed at zero temperature .",
    "we fully characterize the quantum critical point ( qcp ) associated with the dissipation induced superconductor - normal metal transition .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the nature of the transition in the presence of the electric field .",
    "we show that in a certain limit this reduces to a _ depairing transition _",
    "@xcite in the presence of dissipation .",
    "the problem considered in this paper is a classical one in the study of superconductivity from both , experimental and theoretical aspects .",

    ", new aspects of this problem are revealed requiring more sophisticated theoretical approaches .",
    "the present work introduces a novel theoretical treatment and focus on the new aspects of quantum criticality in this paradigmatic system  @xcite .",
    "we consider the following hamiltonian  @xcite describing the superconducting layer , the metallic substrate and their coupling , @xmath0 where @xmath1 describes the two - dimensional ( 2d ) superconductor whose physical properties we are interested in .",
    "@xmath2 takes into account the reservoir and @xmath3 in an obvious notation the coupling between the 2d superconductor and the bulk metal .",
    "this coupling represents a source for dissipation .",
    "explicitly these hamiltonians are given by , @xmath4 the vector potential @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) gives rise to an electric field @xmath7 that acts only in the superconducting layer .",

    "we get @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the superconducting order parameter of the layer .",
    "this hamiltonian has also been recently studied by mitra  @xcite .",
    "in this section we introduce the keldysh formalism  @xcite to obtain the normal and anomalous green s functions relevant for the problem .",
    "the use of the keldysh approach  @xcite is necessary due to the explicit time dependence of the kinetic term in the hamiltonian @xmath12 when the electric field is present .",
    "a direct consequence of this time dependence is that the green s functions are now functions of @xmath15 and not of @xmath16 as in the case @xmath17 .",

    "we introduce four auxiliary green s functions through their equations of motion .",
    "@xmath22 such that , @xmath23 and @xmath24 next , we define the self - energies as : @xmath25 in terms of these self - energies , we have the following implicit equations for the anomalous and normal green s functions , @xmath26 @xmath27",
    "to make further progress we make a reparametrization in time of the equations above .",
    "a convenient choice is to introduce a _ slow time _ [ @xmath28 and a _ fast time _ ( @xmath29 )  @xcite , such that , @xmath30 in terms of these _ times _ , equations ( [ final1 ] ) and ( [ final2 ] ) become , @xmath31 @xmath32 once we have distinguished between the fast and slow time scales we can implement an adiabatic approximation  @xcite which in our case consists to take into account terms up to linear order in the variables associated with the slow time scale .",
    "the validity of this approximation requires the characteristic time associated with the change of the external parameter ( the vector potential ) to be large compared to the lifetime of an electron in the superconducting layer before it is scattered to the metallic substrate .",
