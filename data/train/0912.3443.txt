    "loop quantum gravity ( lqg for short , in @xcite introductions can be found ) is one of the most promising candidates for a quantum theory of the gravitational field .",
    "it represents a non - perturbative , mathematically rigorous quantization of general relativity ( gr ) in the canonical framework .",
    "the corresponding phase space variables are the @xmath1-valued ashtekar connection @xmath2 together with its momentum conjugate @xmath3 commonly called densitized triad or ( yang - mills ) electric field for short .",
    "the crucial step for quantizing gr in the ashtekar framework arises from the natural coupling of the connection to oriented curves @xmath4 via the so - called holonomy map @xmath5=\\mathcal{p}\\mathrm{exp}({-\\int_{\\gamma}a})$ ] i.e. the path - ordered exponential of the integrated ashtekar connection @xmath6 .",
    "this in turn allows for a rigorous construction of a hilbert space ( more precisely a gelfand triplet ) as an @xmath7-space relative to the ashtekar  lewandowski measure .",
    "one of the great surprises and key results of the theory comes from the fact that certain geometrical quantities , most notably the volume of a region and the area of a surface , can be turned into well - defined operators on this hilbert space , which are self - adjoint and posses a discrete spectrum , thereby exhibiting the discrete structure of space at the fundamental planck scale .    in order to regain the dynamics of gr at the quantum level one",
    "has to turn the classical constraints into operators and find their corresponding solution space .",
    "due to the background independent construction this can be done with remarkable ease for the so - called gau and vector ( or diffeomorphism ) constraints , which represent the kinematical symmetries of the theory .",
    "the main stumbling block that remained was the hamiltonian ( or time - evolution ) constraint , which turned out to be quite difficult to quantize ( i.e. define an operator version ) .",
    "once again the interplay between kinematical symmetries and the existence of a well - defined quantization of the volume functional , together with the ingenious insight of thiemann allows the implementation of the hamiltonian constraint as a well - defined operator .",
    "thiemann s discovery rests on the fact that the presence of an inverse volume form in the ( euclidean part of the ) hamiltonian constraint compensating for the double - density behavior of two electric fields , instead of being disastrous could actually be turned into an advantage .",
    "this is achieved by replacing all three terms ( i.e. the two electric fields together with the inverse volume form ) by a single poisson bracket with the volume functional .",
    "actually the same techniques apply to the so - called kinetic part , which however rests on the existence of the euclidean part as a first step .",
    "the present proposal tries to investigate the structure of the full hamiltonian constraint under the light of the above insight .",
    "we will show that it is actually possible to rewrite the hamiltonian constraint in a very compact form , namely as twice iterated poisson bracket of the euclidean hamiltonian constraint and the `` smeared '' volume functional .",
    "this draws on the simple observation that the lapse function allows redistribution from the hamiltonian to the volume .",
    "it has to be pointed out that the proposal works only for the definite value @xmath0 of the so - called barbero ",
    "immirzi parameter , which measures the relative strength between the ashtekar and the spin - connection .",
    "in the remaining part of this section we will briefly define the notation that will be used subsequently .",
    "later in section [ sectiontwo ] , the main part of this paper we present a simplification of the hamiltonian constraint , provided the barbero ",
