    "the ferroelectric - paraelectric phase transition takes place at about @xmath4 k , where the high temperature phase is orthorhombic , space group @xmath5 , with the dipoles disordered with respect to the @xmath3 axis . in a narrow temperature range from @xmath6 k to @xmath4 k",
    ", there exists an incommensurate antiferroelectric phase .",
    "the melting temperature is @xmath7 k. distinguished from displacive ferroelectrics in which the ferroelectric transition is driven by soft phonon modes , nano@xmath0 offers a model system for research of the order - disorder structural phase transition and any associated ferroelectric instability .",
    "@xcite    extensive experimental work on nano@xmath0 has been devoted to probing the mechanism of the no@xmath8 polarization reversal that triggers the order - disorder transition .",
    "the majority of studies support the @xmath1-axis rotation model , but there were also results favoring the @xmath9-axis rotation model.@xcite recently , refined x - ray studies over a wide temperature range reinforced the @xmath1-axis rotation model.@xcite on the theoretical side , the microscopic model calculations done by ehrhardt and michel supported the @xmath1-axis rotation mechanism,@xcite whereas mixed double rotations around the @xmath9-axis and the @xmath1-axis was suggested by kinase and takahashi.@xcite it has long been desirable to apply computer molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations to nano@xmath0 in order to achieve unambiguous understanding of the polarization reversal mechanism .",
    "earlier md simulations with empirical born - mayer pair potentials detected the @xmath1-axis rotation in above - room - temperature nano@xmath0.@xcite unfortunately , the low - temperature structure produced by those simulations was antiferroelectric and apparently disagreed with the experimental observations .",
    "lu and hardy pointed out that the overall phase behavior of nano@xmath0 could be simulated by using an _ a priori _ approach to construct the crystal potential surface ( pes).@xcite the lu - hardy ( lh ) approach was originally designed to deal with molecular crystals such as k@xmath0seo@xmath10 , where exists a mix of bonding types , that is , the intermolecular interactions are mostly ionic , but the constituent atoms in a molecule ( seo@xmath11 in k@xmath0seo@xmath10 ) bond covalently . in the lh approach ,",
    "the intra - molecule interactions were treated by applying the _ ab initio _ self - consistent field method to the gas - phase molecules , while the intermolecular pair potentials were computed within the gordon - kim ( gk ) electron gas theory.@xcite the crux of their application of the gk theory is how to partition the _ ab initio _ molecular charge density between the constituent atoms .",
    "since there is no unique way to separate the charge density of a highly covalently bonded molecule , lu and hardy suggested equal separation in a spirit similar to the mulliken population analysis ( mpa ) . by using this atomic - level method , we could successfully describe the phase transitions in fluoroperovskites,@xcite and ionic crystals with polyatomic molecules including seo@xmath11,@xcite clo@xmath12,@xcite so@xmath11,@xcite sio@xmath13,@xcite and no@xmath14.@xcite note that the mpa happens to preserve the ( zero ) dipole moment of these molecules .",
    "however , several problems appear when we moved on to deal with nano@xmath0 where the no@xmath15 radical has nonzero dipole moment and stronger chemical bonding .",
    "first , it is well known that the mpa , while certainly the most widely employed , is also somewhat arbitrary and the most criticized.@xcite in particular , the mpa overestimates the dipole moment of the free no@xmath8 ion by about @xmath16 .",
    "other difficulties involved the free - ion approximation . unlike in monatomic ionic crystals , there may exist considerable _ internal _ charge - transfer effects in molecular ionic crystals .",
    "electronic band structure calculations @xcite indicated that within a nitrite entity , the nitrogen atom and two oxygen atoms bond covalently , leading to high charge transferability between these constituent atoms",
    ". therefore , in solid nano@xmath0 the no@xmath8 group will feel different crystal - field environments as it rotates and responds by redistributing the charge density among its three constituent atoms .",
    "our goals in this paper are twofold .",
    "first , we show that our atomistic level simulation methods involving pair potentials with the rigid - ion model is capable of correctly describing the phase behavior of nano@xmath0 .",
    "second , we systematically examine the lh approach to understand the reason why it works so well in molecular ionic crystal systems by the following steps : ( i ) we develop another population analysis method that preserves the molecular dipole moment by directly fitting the _ ab initio _",
    "charge density of a molecule ; ( ii ) we carry out _ ab initio _ hartree - fock ( hf ) calculations of the intermolecular interactions and find that the pair potentials from the rigid - ion model can correctly reproduce the _ ab initio _ results ; ( iii ) we investigate the crystal - field effects on the no@xmath8 ion by embedding the ion ( and its first shell of neighbors ) in a lattice of point charges and find a remarkable internal charge - transfer effect .",
    "@xcite several md simulations based on these modifications of the lh approach are also performed .",
    "the ferroelectric - paraelectric transition triggered by the @xmath1-axis rotation of the nitrite ions is observed in all versions of the lh approach .",
    "however , the transition temperatures predicted by these simulations are lower than the experimental values .",
    "furthermore , the transition temperatures obtained from the original version are higher than those predicted by modified versions and closer to the experimental values . after careful examination",
    ", we notice that in the lh approach , the no@xmath17 dipole moments were generally overestimated by about 120% , which reinforces the ground state .",
    "this implies that the crystal structure of nano@xmath0 is stabilized by the anion polarization effects .",
    "thus , we conclude polarization effects are particularly important for the quantitative study of nano@xmath0 .    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes the method we used to obtain the intermolecular interactions .",
    "section iii analyzes the resulting intermolecular potentials in comparison with those obtained from _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "section iv presents the results of our md simulations .",
    "the crystal - field effects on no@xmath17 are discussed in section v. concluding remarks are made in section vi .",
    "our md simulation technique method originates from the gk model for simple ionic crystals such as alkali halides , assuming that ( molecular ) ions in a crystal environment may be described as free ions .",
    "@xcite then it was extended to deal with molecular ionic crystals like k@xmath0seo@xmath10 , in which strong intramolecular covalency exists .",
    "@xcite the main idea is that the molecular ion ( seo@xmath18 in k@xmath0seo@xmath10 ) is treated as a single entity , and intramolecular and intermolecular interactions are treated separately : first we perform _ ab initio _ quantum chemistry calculations for the whole molecular ion , to obtain the optimized structure , the force constants , and the whole electron density @xmath19 .",
    "the intramolecular interactions are described by force constants within the harmonic approximation . as for the intermolecular interactions",
    ", we have to carry out electron population analysis to separate @xmath19 onto each individual atom in the molecular ion , then use the gordon - kim electron gas model to calculate the intermolecular pair potentials .",
    "this approach provides a parameter - free description for the crystal potential - energy surfaces , which allow structural relaxation , md simulation , and lattice dynamics calculations .    in calculating the intermolecular forces",
    ", there are three major approximations as discussed in the following :    \\(1 ) we assume that the geometries and electronic densities of the separate ions remain unchanged once they have been obtained under given circumstance , such as in the equilibrium state of the gas or crystal phases .",
    "this approximation is the fundamental basis for the gk electron gas theory .",
    "general speaking , we found that in an ionic crystal there is no strong chemical bond between ions , hence this approximation is reasonable .",
    "\\(2 ) when dealing with the intermolecular interaction , we assume that the charge density of a rigid ion can be separated into its atomic constituents .",
    "\\(3 ) we assume that the crystal potential energy is composed of the intermolecular and intramolecular interaction , where the intramolecular interaction is expressed in terms of force fields and the intermolecular interaction is a sum of interatomic pair potentials .",
    "atomistic level simulations utilizing pair potentials and the rigid - ion model have great success in describing many ionic systems .",
    "@xcite we showed that this scheme can correctly describe the phase transition behaviors of alkali halide fluoperovskites , @xcite and molecular crystals with tetrahedral @xcite and equilateral triangular @xcite radicals .",
    "however , for nano@xmath0 in which no@xmath17 has only a two fold symmetrical axis , the results were less satisfactory .",
    "@xcite note that the mean hf polarizability of no@xmath8 , 14.156 ( atomic units ) , calculated with the d95 * basis , @xcite is much higher than that of na@xmath20 , 0.343 ( atomic units ) , calculated with the 6 - 31 * basis .",
    "therefore , in solid nano@xmath0 , the rotation of no@xmath8 in the crystal field will induce charge redistribution within the molecule .",
    "hence this dynamic effect may invalidate the rigid ion approximation . in this paper",
    "we shall perform hf calculations for various geometries to verify this scenario .      in the gk model",
    ", we evaluate the interaction between two molecules based on the electron density , @xcite which is approximated as the sum of component densities taken from hf calculations .",
    "that is , if @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the component densities , then the total density is @xmath23 . whereas , interaction potential is computed as the sum of four terms : coulombic , kinetic , exchange , and correlation energies which are expressed in terms of the charge densities .    therefore , suppose the @xmath24 and @xmath25 molecules are made up of @xmath26 and @xmath27 atoms , respectively , then the coulombic interaction between them is    @xmath28    where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the nuclear charges and coordinations of the @xmath33-th atom in the @xmath24 molecule and @xmath34-th atom in the @xmath25 molecule , respectively",
    "this potential energy can be split into two parts : first the long - range part , @xmath35[z_{b , j}-\\int \\rho _ b^{}(\\mathbf{r}_2)d\\mathbf{r}_2]}{|\\mathbf{r}_{a , i}-\\mathbf{r}_{b , j}| } , \\label{cl}\\ ] ] and the short - range part @xmath36 eq .",
    "( [ cl ] ) is essentially the electrostatic interaction energy when the charge densities of the molecules are distributed as point charges on the constituent atoms , which is known as the madelung potential energy .",
    "the non - coulombic energy terms are expressed in the uniform electron gas formula , @xmath37 , \\label{kxc}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is one of the energy functionals for the kinetic , exchange , and correlation interactions .",
    "@xcite note that eq .",
    "( [ kxc ] ) is not composed of pair potentials . in order to obtain the effective pairwise potentials , we approximate eq .",
    "( [ kxc ] ) using    @xmath39 ,   \\label{pair}\\ ] ]    where @xmath40 . @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the charge densities of individual atoms in the @xmath24 and @xmath25 molecules , respectively , which are obtained by a population analysis as described in the next subsection .    even though the non - coulombic forces as determined by eq .",
    "( [ kxc ] ) are not strictly additive , the above approximation appears to be adequate except at very short distances .",
    "as pointed out by waldman and gordon , @xcite the main reason as to why this approximation is valid is because the coulombic force , the largest contribution to the potentials , is additive . based on our calculations , we find additivity of @xmath43 holds only to within about 50% ; however , the overlap contribution to the electrostatic energy dominates @xmath43 and renders additivity to within 10% .",
    "one final remark is in order , for the sake of simplifying the two - electron integral in eq .",
    "( [ coul ] ) , the charge densities , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , are taken as its spherical average . as a result ,",
    "the coulombic interaction is not exactly evaluated . nevertheless , as we shall show in figs .",
    "[ fig : na - no2 ] and [ fig : no2-no2 ] , this error is compensated by those due to the pairwise additive approximation .    to summarize this subsection , we demonstrated that it is possible to analytically express the intermolecular potentials @xmath44 using eqs .",
    "( [ cl ] ) , ( [ cs ] ) and ( [ pair ] ) once the charge density of each individual atom is obtained by an electronic population analysis . in the next subsection",
    ", we shall present further analysis on the charge density .      in this subsection , we discuss the ways to separate the electron density @xmath19 of a molecule into its atomic constituents .",
    "suppose the molecule consists of @xmath26 atoms , then the wave function of the molecule @xmath45 can be written as a linear superposition of atomic wave functions @xmath46 , @xmath47 , centered at each atom ,    @xmath48    in turn , the atomic wave functions @xmath46 can be written as a linear superposition of the basis functions @xmath49",
    "@xmath50    where \\{@xmath51 } are usually the gaussian basis functions , and the coefficients @xmath52 can be obtained from the variational method .",
    "then the electronic density of the molecule is , @xmath53 where @xmath54 , which can be divided into two parts , namely the _ net _ ( @xmath55 ) and _ overlap _ ( @xmath56 ) populations .",
    "the latter can not be ignored in the presence of strong intramolecular covalency .",
    "therefore , separating @xmath19 into its atomic constituents is to split the overlap population .",
    "however , the way to achieve that is not unique .",
    "for example , we can introduce a set of weights @xmath57 due to different criteria such that @xmath58 then we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ density ] ) as following @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the atomic density of atom @xmath33 .",
    ".[table : multipole ] electronic multipole moments of molecule ( @xmath61 ) calculated from the mulliken population analysis . the _ ab initio _ values are shown in parentheses .",
    "all quantities are in atomic units . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     before we proceed with the molecular dynamics simulations , we perform lattice relaxation for the ferroelectric structure of nano@xmath0 both with and without the @xmath62 space group symmetry constraints .",
    "this relaxation procedure provides the crystal structure with zero force on each atom , that is an energy extremum ; it also produces a test to the pes because the resultant structures have to agree reasonably with the experimental data for further simulations to be reliable .",
    "we perform both static and dynamic relaxations : the static one is an application of the newton - raphson algorithm and usually results in finding a local minimum of the energy , and the dynamic one is a simulated annealing calculation for overcoming that limitation .",
    "we start the static lattice relaxation with the experimental parameters . in table",
    "[ table : par ] we present the lattice and basis parameters deduced from the experiments and static relaxation . in all cases , the static relaxation produced essentially the same structure that strongly resembles the experimental structure .",
    "most of the lattice constants in the relaxed structure are shorter than the experimental values ( by 3.7% , 1.5% , and 8.5% for @xmath9 , @xmath3 , and @xmath1 , respectively , in model i , and by 0.5% , -2.4% , and 10% for @xmath9 , @xmath3 , and @xmath1 , respectively , in model ii ) .",
    "hence the calculated volume is smaller than the experimental one by 13% for model i and 10% for model ii , a common feature for simulations using the gk model , which will be addressed in more detail in the next subsection .",
    "next , we go on to relax the statically relaxed crystal structure to zero temperature using a simulated annealing algorithm , in which the amount of kinetic energy in the molecules slowly decreases over the course of the simulation .",
    "we find that the ( zero temperature ) ground states in models i and ii are close to the statically relaxed structures , whereas there are substantial changes taking place in model iii . by monitoring the orientations of the nitrite ions , we find that the ground structure in model iii , still orthorhombic with @xmath63  , @xmath64  , and @xmath65  , is ferroelectric with the dipole moments of no@xmath8 aligned along the @xmath9 axis rather than the experimental @xmath3 axis .",
    "so we conclude that the pes given by models iii did not reflect reality .",
    "this concurs with the previous discussion ( section iii ) on the intermolecular potentials . in the following we use only models i and ii to simulate the phase transition in nano@xmath0 .",

    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed to simulate an infinite crystal .",
    "the md calculations are carried out in the parrinello - rahman scheme @xcite which allows both the volume and the shape of the md cell to vary with time .",
    "the calculation of the energies and forces was handled by the ewald method .",
    "a time step of 0.002 ps was used to integrate the equations of motion . in our heating runs , we raise the temperature of the sample in stages , 20 k each time , up to 1000 k. at each stage , the first 2000 time steps were employed to equilibrate the system , then 10000 time steps were collected for subsequent statistical analysis . since our simulations employ periodic boundary conditions , we can not distinguish the incommensurate structure ( i.e. , phase ii of solid nano@xmath0 ) .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : abc ] through [ fig : ellipsoid ] , we demonstrate that as the md cell is heated , it undergoes two phase transitions : in the first one , the system retains its orthorhombic structure with a change of space group from @xmath62 to @xmath74 , in agreement with the experiments .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath75 is around @xmath76 k for model i and @xmath77 k for model ii , respectively . in the second transition ,",
    "the crystal structure violently changes from orthorhombic to tetragonal at temperature ( @xmath78 ) which is around @xmath79 k for model i and @xmath80 k for model ii , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : abc ] .",
    "however , we argue that the crystal has already melted before this type of transition could be observed in reality . to investigate the mechanism of the polarization reversal of no@xmath8",
    ", we monitor the crystal polarization and display the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : fe ] .",
    "let the dipole moment of anion @xmath33 be @xmath81 and the quadrupole moment be @xmath82 calculated by using the point charges on the @xmath27 and @xmath83 atoms .",
    "then the mean dipole moment per anion at temperature @xmath84 is @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the number of no@xmath8 in the md cell and the brackets denote an average over the md run .",
    "in addition , we define the antiferroelectric polarization as @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 is the lattice vectors associated with the @xmath33-th ion . within our statistical uncertainty",
    "we find over all temperature range @xmath90 , while @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "this fact confirms that the transition taking place at @xmath75 is the ferroelectric - paraelectric phase transition .",
    "furthermore , we calculated the mean quadrupole moment @xmath93 .",
    "when the dipole vector of a no@xmath8 is aligned along the @xmath3 axis , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 for model i and @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 for model ii ; thus @xmath100 .",
    "this relation holds as the no@xmath8 ion rotates around the @xmath1 axis ; nevertheless , one would expect @xmath101 when the no@xmath8 ion rotates without directional preference .",
    "the fact that @xmath102 for @xmath103 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fe ] ) reveals that the no@xmath8 anions rotate primarily about the @xmath1 axis . when @xmath104 , @xmath105 , i.e. , nano@xmath0 becomes an orientational liquid .",
    "further , in fig .  [",
    "fig : uu ] we show the mean - square atomic displacements @xmath106 where @xmath107 denotes the displacements along the @xmath108 axes , respectively .",
    "different models of no@xmath8 reversal are expected to satisfy the following conditions : ( 1 ) rotation around the @xmath1 axis : @xmath109 and @xmath110 ; ( 2 ) rotation around the @xmath9 axis : @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "this figure relates to recent x - ray experiments which used the same quantities to investigate the polarization reversal mechanism .",
    "@xcite the experiments confirmed that the first condition holds for both ferroelectric and paraelectric phases .",
    "another important feature revealed by the experiments is that @xmath113 in the ferroelectric phase , whereas @xmath114 in the paraelectric phase .",
    "that is , @xmath115 and @xmath116 are reversed across @xmath75 .",
    "these features are reproduced in fig .",
    "[ fig : uu ] with exception of @xmath112 in the paraelectric phase .",
    "this means the no@xmath8 motions in our simulations are more mobile than those in the real crystal , rendering the simulated transition temperatures lower than the experimental values of @xmath117 k and the melting temperature @xmath7 k. in other words , the barriers to no@xmath8 rotation in our models are too small .",
    "in addition , in fig .",
    "[ fig : ellipsoid ] , we show the average crystal structures of nano@xmath0 at different temperatures .",
    "the ellipsoids in these pictures represent the root - mean - square deviations of the atoms from their average positions and thus indicate the thermal motions of these atoms .",
    "the @xmath1-axis rotation mode can be clearly seen , particularly in fig .",
    "[ fig : ellipsoid](c ) .    according to the calculations described in the previous section , model ii generally gives a better description of free no@xmath8 and the intermolecular potential energies than model i. however , the simulation based on model i matches closer the experimental results than that based on model ii ,",
    "that is , @xmath118 and @xmath78 predicted by model i are closer to experiment , this indicates that the crystal fields and polarization effects are particularly important for quantitatively studying the nano@xmath0 system , where the ferroelectric structure is considerably stabilized by anion polarization effects .",
    "actually , the mpa employed by model i does not preserve the _ ab initio _ dipole moment of free no@xmath8 . rather , it overestimates the dipole moment by 120% , thus leading to higher no@xmath17 rotational barriers than those predicted by model ii , which in turn raises the transition temperature and provides a better simulation in comparison with the experiments .",
    "it is worth mentioning the less desirable agreement between theoretical and experimental volumes , namely , the 13% discrepancy for model i and 10% for model ii . to address this we make one simple change : by following waldman and gordon,@xcite we increase the kinetic energy term in the gordon - kim potentials by 5% , this reduces the discrepancy to 9% for model i and 6% for model ii .",
    "having done this we rerun the md to obtain values of @xmath119 of 360 k for model i and 303 k for model ii . while this change worsens the value for model i , the value for model ii is virtually unchanged . and in both cases the transition mechanism is unaltered .",
    "thus the slight hardening of the short - range potentials removes most of the volume discrepancies",
    ". however , there is no material change in the mechanism of the phase transition .",
    "this robustness of the results with respect to minor variations in the potential demonstrates that our basic conclusion remain valid .      based on the previous simulation results , the order - disorder phase transition in nano@xmath0 involves the rotation of the nitrite ions .",
    "we devise a scheme to calculate the three rotational barriers for no@xmath8 around the crystallographic @xmath9 , @xmath3 , and @xmath1 axes with its center of mass fixed : we start from the experimental ferroelectric structure @xcite as the ground state and calculate its energy difference with one of the two nitrite ions in the unit cell being rotated about the respective axis .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : barrier](a ) and [ fig : barrier](b ) .",
    "rotational barriers of one of the two nitrite ions in the unit cell around the @xmath9 , @xmath3 , and @xmath1 axes with its center of mass fixed .

    "for both models i and ii , the rotation around the @xmath1-axis has an energy barrier 5 - 10 times smaller than those of the other rotations , which is a characteristic of nitrites .",
    "@xcite hence , our calculations unambiguously reveal that the reorientation of no@xmath8 in the paraelectric phase occur essentially by rotations around the @xmath1 axis .",
    "in addition , the barriers calculated in model i are higher than that in model ii , confirming that the transition temperature in model i will be higher than in model ii .    in figs .  [ fig : barrier](c ) and [ fig : barrier](d ) , we also plot the contribution to the rotational barriers purely from the electrostatic interaction , that is , in the point - charge model with the short range forces deleted . comparing fig .

    "[ fig : barrier](c ) , or fig .",
    "[ fig : barrier](b ) with fig .",
    "[ fig : barrier](d ) , we notice that the point - charge model gives rise to a quite different rotation barrier about the @xmath9 axis : it bottoms at about @xmath120 and is lower than the ground state energy due to the omission of short - range interactions , which comes from overlap of the charge cloud of an atom with those of its neighbors .",
    "in this section , we investigate the crystal - field effects on the no@xmath8 ion , which include electrostatic interaction from the background lattice , overlap compression of the no@xmath8 charge cloud through interaction with its neighbors , and charge - transfer between molecules which is usually small in ionic crystals . in the studies of monatomic ions @xcite and cyanides @xcite ,",
    "fowler _ et al .",

    "all anions except the central no@xmath8 are represented by single point charges . hence , there are 174 point charges surrounding the no@xmath8 ion",
    ". calculations of this type are referred to as cryst .",
    "obviously , in the cryst calculation we take into account only the crystal - field effect arising purely from electrostatic interaction .    at the next level of sophistication ,",
    "we replace the six nearest positive charges of the central no@xmath8 in the above lattice by the na cations .",
    "calculations of this type are referred to as clust . in both cryst and clust calculations , the geometrical structure of the no@xmath17",
    "is fixed at its experimental values .",
    "we employ the same basis set , d95 * , for the in - crystal no@xmath17 ion as for the free no@xmath8 ion . in order to keep the clust calculations to a manageable size",
    ", we use the minimal basis set , sto-3 g , for the na@xmath20 ions unless specified .",
    "the cations , however , are relatively insensitive to the crystal environment and they are included here only to account for their compressing effect on the no@xmath8 wave functions .",
    "we find that adding extra basis functions to na@xmath20 will not change the results significantly .",
    "the in - crystal no@xmath8 initially points in the @xmath3 direction as in the ferroelectric phase of nano@xmath0 @xcite .",

    "( a ) clust and ( b ) cryst . ]    clearly , the dipole moment of the no@xmath8 changes considerably as it rotates , indicating strong crystal field effects on the reorientation of the no@xmath8 . since the electron density of the no@xmath8 is compressed by its 6 neighboring sodium cations , the variation in magnitude of its dipole moment is smaller in the clust model than that in the cryst model .",
    "the electron cloud of the no@xmath8 is most and least variable when it rotates around the @xmath9 and @xmath3 axes , respectively ; for the @xmath1-axis rotation , which has the lowest rotational barrier , the dipole moment goes down from 0.661 debye at @xmath123 to 0.534 debye at @xmath124 in the clust model , as shown fig .",
    "[ fig : polarizable](a ) .    in the context of population analysis , increase of the dipole moment of no@xmath15 implies that more electrons are distributed on the o atom , i.e. , electrons are flowing from the nitrogen atom to the oxygen atoms .",
    "conversely , decrease of the dipole moment indicates a reversal in electron transfer .",
    "therefore , we have demonstrated considerable _",
    "intramolecular _ charge - transfer , although the intermolecular charge - transfer is usually small in ionic crystals .",
    "this intramolecular charge - transfer could be further elucidated based on the language of molecular orbitals ( mos ) : in the minimal basis set of atomic orbitals ( aos ) on nitrogen and oxygen , each atom of the no@xmath17 molecule contributes one @xmath125-orbital perpendicular to the molecular plane .",
    "thus their linear combinations , which are determined by the crystal field , form three different @xmath126 mos extended over the entire molecule , thus leading to the above - mentioned intramolecular charge - transfer .",
    "note that the mean hf polarizability of free no@xmath8 , @xmath127 in the atomic units , is much higher than that of free na@xmath20 , @xmath128 , calculated by using the 6 - 31 * basis .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to expect that no@xmath8 in solid nano@xmath0 encountering different crystal - field environments as it rotates , redistributes its charge among the three constituent atoms to lower its energy .    in fig .",

    "we show that the rotational barriers of the central no@xmath8 . on the whole ,",
    "the clust results are similar to those in figs .",
    "[ fig : barrier](a ) and [ fig : barrier](b ) , while the cryst results are similar to those in figs .",
    "[ fig : barrier](c ) and [ fig : barrier](d ) .",
    "the reason is that in the cryst calculations we consider only the crystal - field effects originating purely from electrostatic interactions with the background point charges , similar to the point charge model used to obtain figs .",
    "[ fig : barrier](c ) and [ fig : barrier](d ) .",
    "whereas , in the clust calculations , overlap compression is also taken into account , which is reflected in figs .",
    "[ fig : barrier](a ) and [ fig : barrier](b ) as inclusion of short range repulsion . in fig .",
    "[ fig : barrier444](a ) , the barrier to the @xmath1-axis rotation is the lowest , but comparable with that to the @xmath3-axis rotation .",
    "this feature is caused by the fact that all background anions are represented by single point charges in our clust and cryst calculations ; however , we anticipate that restoring multipole moments of these background anions would increase the barrier difference among rotations about the @xmath9 , @xmath3 , and @xmath1 axes .",
    "to further elaborate the electronic polarization effect on no@xmath15 arising from the crystal environment , we change the rotation center to the center of mass of the no@xmath15 which was assumed in the model by kremer and siems .",
    "@xcite in this case , the dipole moment of no@xmath15 and the rotational barriers are presented in figs .",

    "no@xmath8 rotates around the @xmath108 axes through its center of mass .",
    "( a ) dipole moment of no@xmath8 , and ( b ) rotational barriers . ]    the dipole moment changes in a different way from that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : polarizable](a ) .",
    "in particular , the dipole moment in the ferroelectric phase ( @xmath123-rotation ) is larger than at @xmath129-rotation in fig .",
    "[ fig : polarizable](a ) , while it is smaller in fig .",
    "[ fig : crystal](a ) . on the other hand",
    ", there is no qualitative discrepancy between fig .",
    "[ fig : crystal](b ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : barrier444](a ) ; the main differences are : the rotational barrier about the @xmath9 axis has risen by 135% while the barrier about the @xmath1 axis is depressed by 26% .",
    "this means that the order of rotational barriers is enhanced by the change of the rotation center .",
    "although strong crystal field effects have been revealed by these _ ab initio _ calculations , the rotational barriers obtained from the polarizable - ion models are in qualitative agreement with those from the rigid - ion models , confirming that the rigid - ion model is capable of describing the phase behavior in nano@xmath0 .",
    "we have presented md simulations of nano@xmath0 using a hybrid _ a priori _ method consisting of _ ab initio _ calculations and gordon - kim electron gas theory to analytically calculate the crystal potential surface .",
    "this method has been carefully examined by using different population analysis methods .",
    "we have carried out _ ab initio _ hartree - fock calculations of the intermolecular interactions for no@xmath8:na@xmath130 and no@xmath8:no@xmath8 dimers and concluded that the pair potentials of the rigid - ion model can correctly reproduce the _ ab initio _ results .",
    "we demonstrated that a rigid - ion model is capable of describing phase behavior in solid nano@xmath0 .",
    "the crystal - field effects on the no@xmath8 ion are also addressed in two polarizable - ion models for which the ferroelectric phase of nano@xmath0 was found to have a larger dipole moment of no@xmath8 than the @xmath129-rotation phase .",
    "remarkable internal charge - transfer effect is found to be stabilizing the crystal structure of nano@xmath0 . in our md simulations , two rigid - ion models using mpa and fpa , respectively , have been studied .",
    "the one using mpa , which overestimates the dipole moment of no@xmath8 , gives rise to the more comparable results with the experiments , since such overestimation also stabilizes the crystal structure , thus mimics the anion polarization effect . to quantitatively simulate nano@xmath0 ,",
