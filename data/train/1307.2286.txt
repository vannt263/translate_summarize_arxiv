    "during the last three decades there has been an increasing number of papers devoted to the study of random graphs and complex networks , in view of the fact that they describe systems in many knowledge areas : from maths and physics to finance and social sciences , passing through biology and chemistry @xcite . in particular , some of those works report studies of spectral and eigenfunction properties of complex networks ; see for example refs .",
    "that is , since complex networks composed by nodes and the bonds joining them can be represented by sparse matrices , it is quite natural to ask about the spectral and eigenfunction properties of such _ adjacency _ matrices . then , in fact , studies originally motivated on physical systems represented by hamiltonian sparse random matrices @xcite can be directly applied to complex networks .",
    "in contrast to the numerous works devoted to study spectral and eigenfunction properties of complex netwoks , to our knowledge , just a few focus on some of their scattering and transport properties @xcite .",
    "so , in the present work we study numerically several statistical properties of the scattering matrix and the electronic transport across disordered tight - binding networks described by sparse real symmetric matrices . we stress that we use a scattering approach to electronic transport ; see for example @xcite .",
    "in addition , we concentrate on the case of a small number of attached leads ( or terminals ) , each of them supporting one open channel .",
    "we also note that tight - binding complex networks have also been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the tight - binding random networks we shall study here are described by the tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath11 where @xmath0 is the number of nodes or vertexes in the network , @xmath12 are on - site potentials and @xmath13 are the hopping integrals between sites @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "then we choose @xmath16 to be a member of an ensemble of @xmath17 sparse real symmetric matrices whose nonvanishing elements are statistically independent random variables drawn from a normal distribution with zero mean @xmath18 and variance @xmath19 . as in refs .",
    "@xcite , here we define the sparsity of @xmath16 , @xmath1 , as the fraction of the @xmath20 nonvanishing off - diagonal matrix elements .",
    "i.e. , @xmath1 is the network average connectivity .",
    "thus , our random network model corresponds to an ensemble of adjacency matrices of erds - rnyi  type random graphs @xcite .",
    "notice that with the prescription given above our network model displays _ maximal disorder _ since averaging over the network ensemble implies average over connectivity and over on - site potentials and hopping integrals . with this averaging procedure",
    "we get rid off any individual network characteristic ( such as _ scars _",
    "@xcite which in turn produce topological resonances @xcite ) that may lead to deviations from random matrix theory ( rmt ) predictions which we use as a reference .",
    "i.e. , we choose this network model to retrieve well known random matrices in the appropriate limits : a diagonal random matrix is obtained for @xmath21 when the nodes in the network are isolated , while a member of the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) is recovered for @xmath22 when the network is fully connected .    however , it is important to add that the _ maximal disorder _ we consider is not necessary for a graph / network to exhibit universal rmt behavior .",
    "in fact : ( i ) it is well known that tight - binding cubic lattices with on - site disorder ( known as the three - dimensional anderson model @xcite ) , forming networks with fixed regular connectivity having a very dilute hamiltonian matrix , show rmt behavior in the _ metallic phase _ ( see for example refs .",
    "( ii ) it has been demonstrated numerically and theoretically that graphs with fixed connectivity show spectral @xcite and scattering @xcite universal properties corresponding to rmt predictions , where in this case the disorder is introduced either by choosing random bond lengths @xcite ( which is a parameter not persent in our network model ) or by randomizing the vertex - scattering matrices @xcite ( somehow equivalent to consider random on - site potentials ) .",
    "moreover , some of the rmt properties of quantum graphs have already been tested experimentally by the use of small ensembles of small microwave networks with fixed connectivity @xcite .",
    "( iii ) complex networks having specific topological properties ( such as small - world and scale - free networks , among others ) , where randomness is applied only to the connectivity , show signatures of rmt behavior in their spectral and eigenfunction properties @xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we define the scattering setup as well as the scattering quantities under investigation and provide the corresponding analytical predictions from random scattering - matrix theory for systems with time - reversal symmetry .",
    "these analytical results will be used as a reference along the paper . in section iii",
    "we analyze the average scattering matrix elements @xmath2 , the conductance probability distribution @xmath3 , the average conductance @xmath4 , the shot noise power @xmath5 , and the elastic enhancement factor @xmath6 for tight - binding networks as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we show that all scattering and transport quantities listed above are invariant for fixed @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , we propose a heuristic and universal relation between @xmath2 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 and the disorder parameter @xmath10 .",
    "finally , section iv is left for conclusions .",
    "we open the isolated samples , defined above by the tight - binding random network model , by attaching @xmath23 semi - infinite single channel leads .",
    "each lead is described by the one - dimensional semi - infinite tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath24 using standard methods one can write the scattering matrix ( @xmath25-matrix ) in the form @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are @xmath31 transmission and reflection matrices ; @xmath32 is the @xmath33 unit matrix , @xmath34 is the wave vector supported in the leads , and @xmath35 is an effective non - hermitian hamiltonian given by @xmath36 here , @xmath37 is an @xmath38 matrix that specifies the positions of the attached leads to the network .",
    "however , in the random network model we are studying here all nodes are equivalent ; so , we attach the @xmath23 leads to @xmath23 randomly chosen nodes .",
    "the elements of @xmath37 are equal to zero or @xmath39 , where @xmath39 is the coupling strength . moreover , assuming that the wave vector @xmath40 do not change significantly in the center of the band , we set @xmath41 and neglect the energy dependence of @xmath42 and @xmath25 .    since in the limit @xmath22 the random network model reproduces the goe , in that limit we expect the statistics of the scattering matrix , eq .  ( [ smatrix ] ) , to be determined by the circular orthogonal ensemble ( coe ) which is the appropriate scattering matrix ensemble for _ internal _",
    "systems @xmath16 with time reversal symmetry .",
    "thus , below , we provide the statistical results for the @xmath25-matrix and the transport quantities to be analyzed in the following sections , assuming the orthogonal symmetry . in all cases",
    ", we also assume the absence of direct processes ( also known as perfect coupling condition ) , i.e. , @xmath43 .",
    "we start with the average of the @xmath25-matrix elements .",
    "it is known that @xmath44 where @xmath45 means ensemble average over the coe .    within a scattering approach to the electronic transport ,",
    "once the scattering matrix is known one can compute the dimensionless conductance @xcite @xmath46 and its distribution @xmath3 . for @xmath47 , i.e. considering two single - channel leads attached to the network , @xmath3",
    "is given by @xmath48 while for @xmath49 , @xmath50 for arbitrary @xmath51 , the prediction for the average value of @xmath52 is @xmath53 for the derivation of the expressions above see for example ref .",
    "a related transport quantity is the shot noise power @xmath54 which as a function of @xmath51 reads @xcite @xmath55    another scattering quantity of interest that measures _ cross sections _",
    "fluctuations is the elastic enhancement factor @xcite @xmath56 that in the rmt limit becomes @xmath57    in the following sections we focus on @xmath2 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 for the tight - binding random network model .",
    "in all cases below we set the coupling strength @xmath39 such that @xmath58 is approximately zero in order to compare our results , in the limit @xmath59 , with the rmt predictions reviewed above , see eqs .",
    "( [ saa]-[p ] ) and ( [ fcoe ] ) . to find the perfect coupling condition we plot @xmath60 vs.  @xmath39 for fixed @xmath0 and @xmath1 and look for the minimum . as an example , in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we plot @xmath60 vs.  @xmath39 for random networks having @xmath61 nodes with @xmath62 , 0.44 , and 0.99 .",
    "notice that : for @xmath63 , @xmath64 ; i.e. , since there is no coupling between the network and the leads , there is total reflection of the waves incoming from the leads . while since for any @xmath65 the waves do interact with the random network , @xmath66 .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that the curves @xmath60 vs.  @xmath39 behave similarly .",
    "in fact we identify two regimes : when @xmath67 , @xmath60 decreases with @xmath39 ; while for @xmath68 , @xmath60 increases with @xmath39 . since @xmath69 is the coupling strength value at which @xmath70 , we set @xmath71 to achieve the perfect coupling condition .",
    "in addition , as in previous studies @xcite , here we found that the curves @xmath60 vs.  @xmath39 are well fitted by the expression @xmath72 where @xmath73 are fitting constants and the plus and minus signs correspond to the regions @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively . with the help of eq .",
    "( [ svse ] ) we can find @xmath69 with a relatively small number of data points .",
    "moreover , we heuristically found that @xmath74 then , we use this prescription to compute @xmath69 which is the value for the coupling strength that we set in all the calculations below .    in the following , all quantities and histograms were computed by the use of @xmath75 random network realizations for each combination of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",

    "( [ avs ] ) , for tight - binding random networks having @xmath61 nodes as a function of the coupling strength @xmath39 .",
    "we found @xmath76 , 2.15 , and 2.63 for @xmath62 , 0.44 , and 0.99 , respectively .",
    "dashed lines are fittings of eq .",
    "( [ svse ] ) to the data .",
    "each point was computed by averaging over @xmath75 random network realizations.,width=264 ]      first we consider the case @xmath47 , where the @xmath25-matrix is a @xmath77 matrix . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) we plot the ensemble average of the elements @xmath78 ( average reflexion ) and @xmath79 ( average transmission ) as a function of the connectivity @xmath1 for three different network sizes .",
    "the coe limit , eq .  ( [ saa ] ) , expected for @xmath59 is also plotted ( dot - dashed lines ) as reference .",
    "notice that for all three network sizes the behavior is similar : there is a strong @xmath1-dependence of the average @xmath25-matrix elements driving the random network from a localized or insulating regime [ @xmath80 and @xmath81 ; i.e. , the average conductance is close to zero ] for @xmath82 , to a delocalized or metallic regime [ @xmath83 and @xmath84 ; i.e. , rmt results are already recovered ] for @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , the curves @xmath2 vs.  @xmath1 are displaced along the @xmath1-axis : the larger the network size @xmath0 the smaller the value of @xmath1 needed to approach the coe limit .",
    "we now recall that the parameter @xmath85 was shown to fix ( i ) spectral properties of sparse random matrices @xcite , ( ii ) the percolation transition of erds - rnyi random graphs , see for example ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath10 has the name of average degree ; and ( iii ) the nearest - neighbor energy level spacing distribution and the entropic eigenfunction localization length of sparse random matrices @xcite .",
    "so , it make sense to explore the dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath10 .",
