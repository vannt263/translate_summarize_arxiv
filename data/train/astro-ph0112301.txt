    "the @xmath0 chamaeleontis star cluster is a compact grouping of pms stars at a distance of 97 pc ( mamajek , lawson & feigelson 1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "the cluster is one of the closest open clusters , and one of the nearest groups of pms stars known .",
    "analysis of hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagrams constructed using contemporary evolutionary models indicate an age of @xmath2 myr ( lawson & feigelson 2001 ) , similar to other nearby groups of pms stars such as the tw hya association ( webb et al .",
    "the age of the cluster is intermediate between young pms stars ( ages of @xmath5 a few myr ) still associated with their parent molecular clouds and older post - t tauri ( ages of @xmath6 a few @xmath7 myr ) populations , and is thus at an interesting age for the study of science issues concerning early stellar evolution , e.g. , angular momentum evolution , disk dissipation and planet formation , and magnetic activity evolution .",
    "mamajek et al .",
    "( 1999 ) listed a population of 13 primaries ; 12 of these are x - ray emitting stars detected during a _ rosat _ high - resolution imager ( hri ) pointing ( the recx stars ) and the 13th is the x - ray - quiet a star hd 75505 .",
    "these 13 objects consist of 3 early - type systems ( @xmath0 cha , rs cha ab and hd 75505 ) and 10 wtt stars .",
    "completing the census of cluster members is important for studies examining the properties of a coeval population of pms stars .",
    "consideration of the cluster initial mass function ( imf ) suggests that the stellar population may be @xmath8 the known number of primaries ( mamajek et al .",
    "2000 ) . in this paper",
    "we report the discovery of 2 new late - type cluster members residing within the _ rosat _ hri region , following a search for stars with photometric chacteristics similar to the known members . in the following sections we detail our search and analysis methods .",
    "compared to most field stars of similar colour ( or temperature ) , members of the @xmath0 cha cluster are elevated in magnitude ( or luminosity ) in the colour - mag ( or hr ) diagram , owing to a combination of youth , proximity and low interstellar reddening .",
    "[ westin ( 1985 ) found @xmath9(@xmath10 ) = 0.004 for @xmath0 cha , indicating that reddening is unimportant for the cluster . ]",
    "cluster members appear to be highly coeval ( to @xmath11 myr depending upon the adopted evolutionary model ; see lawson & feigelson 2001 ) , with most of the late - type recx stars forming a near - linear sequence in the colour - magnitude diagram .",
    "several recx stars appeared elevated in brightness above the sequence due to suspected binarity , which has since been confirmed in 2 cases by khler ( 2001 ) .",
    "these characteristics can be used to select candidate cluster members with similar photometric properties to the known cluster stars .",
    "spectroscopic study can then confirm signs of stellar youth , in particular enhanced lithium .",
    "thus new members of the cluster can be found irrespective of their x - ray properties and without prior knowledge of their distances or proper motions .",
    "however , such a sample might suffer contamination from background giants and foreground stars .",

    "the recx stars were elevated above the vast majority of stars , but a broad giant branch overlapped the region of the diagram occupied by the k - type recx stars .",
    "lawson et al . ( 2001 ) used the 1-m telescope and 1k @xmath13 1k site charge - coupled device ( ccd ) at the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) to obtain multi - epoch differential @xmath14-band observations and cousins _ vri _ photometry of the late - type members of the cluster .",
    "in addition to these data , fields neighbouring those containing the known members were observed to search for new members .",
    "_ vri _ frames were obtained with exposure times ranging from @xmath15 s to encompass the magnitude range of the late - type members , and to obtain photometry to fainter limits .",
    "the deepest frames obtained useful ( few percent accuracy ) photometry of stars of @xmath16 , or stars of spectral type m5 and mass @xmath17m@xmath4 at the distance and age of the cluster according to the models of siess , dufour & forestini ( 2000 ) . these data were calibrated against equatorial and southern photometric standard stars .",
    "the site ccd has a field of view of 26 arcmin@xmath18 at the @xmath19/16 cassegrain focus of the 1-m telescope .",
    "23 fields were observed , many over - lapping , for a total area of @xmath20 arcmin@xmath18 or @xmath21 40% of the extent of the cluster as defined by mamajek et al .",
    "stars in each field were compared to the sequence of recx stars in the ( @xmath22 ) versus @xmath14 colour - magnitude diagram .",
    "candidates were selected as those objects with @xmath14 mags that fell , for their ( @xmath22 ) colour , within the range @xmath23 mag of the sequence of recx stars ( fig .",
    "this criterion accounted for the possibility of a greater spread of ages within the cluster than is apparent in the recx stars , highly reddened stars or binary stars with elevated @xmath14 mags , and non - linearities in the colour - magnitude relationship for the cluster ( lawson & feigelson 2001 ) .",
    "of @xmath24 stars measured , only 6 met the criterion ( table 1 ) .",
    "most stars in the fields were @xmath25 mag fainter than the sequence ; in particular the 3 m - type candidates were the only stars with ( @xmath22 ) @xmath25 , and with @xmath14 magnitudes that differed by @xmath26 mag from the extrapolated linear sequence .    the differential @xmath14-band data were obtained with a 30 s exposure time , with @xmath27 observations of each field obtained during 1999 and @xmath28 during 2000 .",
