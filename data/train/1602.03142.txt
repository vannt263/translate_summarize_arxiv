    "it is classical that the magnetic field generated by a closed wire is given by the biot  savart law .",
    "that is , if @xmath0 is a closed curve in @xmath1 of length  @xmath2 and parametrized , say , by the arc - length parameter , its associated magnetic field is given by the biot ",
    "savart integral @xmath3 it is apparent that the vector field @xmath4 , which is divergence - free , is in fact independent of the parametrization of the curve , although it does depend on its orientation .",
    "while the magnetic fields created by simple curves , such as a circular wire , are well understood and have been utilized to describe a wide range of physical phenomena , our understanding of the magnetic fields created by more complicated wires remains strikingly limited .",
    "this led ulam to consider the relationship between the degree of knottedness of the wire and that of the associated periodic magnetic lines .",
    "specifically , ulam posed the question of whether the magnetic field created by a knotted wire must have a periodic magnetic line of nontrivial topology .",
    "this is among the first problems of _ the scottish book _",
    "* problem 18 ) , the original manuscript of which goes back to 1935 .",
    "this question of ulam was set in a broader context in his later problem collection  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section vii.7 ) , where he asks whether the magnetic lines topologically reflect the knottedness of the wire .",
    "unlike many of the problems collected in _ the scottish book _ , the progress made on these questions has been scarce .",
    "this is particularly remarkable , on the one hand , because the existence of knotted fields plays a significant role in a number of areas of physics ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and , on the other hand , because it has been recently proposed to employ knotted wires to construct a new magnetic confinement device , called the knotatron  @xcite .",
    "the reason for the lack of rigorous contributions to this line of research is probably that , by the very nature of the problems , the proof of these results must combine ideas from the theory of dynamical systems , which are key to study the knot types of the magnetic lines , with fine analytic estimates for the biot  savart integral associated with a curve of complicated geometry .",
    "our objective in this paper is to provide two somehow complementary results concerning the relationship between the knottedness of the wire and the topology of the magnetic lines .",
    "the first result asserts that there are wires and magnetic lines whose knot types can be prescribed at will ( and independently ) . in particular , there are wires knotted in an arbitrarily complicated way with an unknotted periodic magnetic line and there are wires isotopic to the unknot with a magnetic line isotopic to any given knot . more precisely , our first result can be stated as follows :    [ t1 ] let @xmath5 and @xmath6 be any two closed curves in @xmath1 .",
    "then there is a wire isotopic to @xmath5 whose associated magnetic field has a periodic magnetic line isotopic to  @xmath6 .",
    "our second result asserts that , however , ulam s original question can be answered in the affirmative at least for @xmath7-generic curves .",
    "that is , given any curve in the space , there is a smooth @xmath7-small deformation of it which is isotopic to the original curve and has a magnetic line of the same knot type . to state",
    "this result , we will say that two isotopic curves are _ arbitrarily @xmath8-close _ if the isotopy can be taken arbitrarily close to the identity in the @xmath8  norm .",
    "[ t2 ] let @xmath5 be a closed curve in @xmath1 . given any integer @xmath9 , there is a wire isotopic to  @xmath5 and arbitrarily @xmath7-close to it whose associated magnetic field has a periodic magnetic line isotopic to  @xmath5 and arbitrarily @xmath8-close to it .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the magnetic lines constructed in the above theorems are not just a mathematical curiosity , but they should be observable in actual experiments .",
    "this is because they are structurally stable , so any @xmath10  small perturbation of the magnetic field ( e.g. , the magnetic field associated with a @xmath10  small deformation of the wire ) still has a magnetic line of the same topology . in this direction ,",
    "a feature of this magnetic line that we find quite surprising is that it is in fact hyperbolic , not elliptic , so in particular there are no toroidal magnetic surfaces in a neighborhood of it .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s.asympt ]",
    "we will consider magnetic fields generated by a current density field defined on a toroidal surface and compute the asymptotic behavior of the corresponding biot  savart integral as the width of the surface tends to zero . in section  [ s.wires ]",
    "we will connect this kind of magnetic fields with fields created by wires .",
    "this will hinge on a measure - theoretic argument that exploits the structure of divergence - free vector fields on a torus whose integral curves are all periodic .",
    "these results are put to use in sections  [ s.t1 ] and  [ s.t2 ] , where we respectively prove theorems  [ t1 ] and  [ t2 ] .",
    "we conclude the introduction with a word about notation . throughout the paper , all the curves",
    "are assumed to be smooth and without self - intersections unless stated otherwise , and the isotopies and diffeomorphisms are always of class @xmath11 .",
    "when it does not give rise to confusion , we will use the same notation  @xmath5 for a parametrized curve in space , which is a map @xmath12 from the real line ( or the circle ) to  @xmath1 , and for its image @xmath13 .",
    "a key ingredient in the proof of theorems  [ t1 ] and  [ t2 ] will be the use of magnetic fields that are not generated by wires , but by current densities supported on toroidal surfaces . our goal in this section is to analyze the behavior of magnetic fields of this kind",
    ". we will be particularly interested in the case where the toroidal surface is very thin .    to make things precise ,",
    "let us consider the toroidal surface @xmath14 which is a smooth torus of the same knot type as the curve  @xmath5 provided that the width  @xmath15 is small enough .",
    "we will define coordinates @xmath16 on the domain bounded by @xmath17 as follows .",
    "let @xmath18 be an arc - length parametrization of the curve  @xmath5 , whose length we will denote by @xmath2 .",
    "this amounts to saying that the tangent field  @xmath19 has unit norm and @xmath0 is @xmath2-periodic , so in particular we can assume that @xmath20 . without loss of generality , we will make the assumption that the curve @xmath5 does not have any inflection points , which allows us to define the normal and binormal vectors @xmath21 at any point of the curve @xmath0 .",
    "it is well known that this assumption is satisfied for generic curves  @xcite ( roughly speaking , `` generic '' here refers to an open and dense set , with respect to a reasonable @xmath8 topology , in the space of smooth curves in @xmath1 ) .    using the normal and binormal vector fields and denoting by @xmath22 the two - dimensional unit disk",
    ", we can introduce coordinates @xmath23 in the solid torus bounded by @xmath17 via the diffeomorphism @xmath24 recall that the unit tangent vector is @xmath25 .    in the coordinates @xmath16",

    "we will sometimes take polar coordinates @xmath29 in the disk  @xmath22 , which are defined as @xmath30 in terms of these coordinates , the volume reads as @xmath31\\,ds\\,dr\\,d{\\theta}\\,.\\ ] ]    we shall next consider magnetic fields created by current densities supported on  @xmath17 .",
    "the current distribution will be given by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the surface measure on the surface  @xmath17 and the density @xmath34 is a smooth tangent vector field defined on  @xmath17 .",
    "the associated magnetic field is then @xmath35 we will always assume that the divergence of  @xmath34 on the surface is zero ( which is equivalent to demanding that the divergence of the vector - valued measure @xmath36 is zero , in the sense of distributions ) , so that @xmath37 indeed has the physical interpretation of a magnetic field .",
    "in particular , @xmath37 satisfies maxwell s equations @xmath38    the main result of this section is the following lemma , which provides the asymptotic behavior as  @xmath39 of the magnetic field @xmath37 for a wide family of current densities  @xmath34 .",
    "this family has two important features : firstly , the fields are divergence - free , and secondly , they have a special dependence on  @xmath15 that is crucial to prove the existence of hyperbolic periodic magnetic lines isotopic to  @xmath5 .",
    "since we will only be interested in the behavior of the field near  @xmath5 , let us restrict our attention to a fixed small neighborhood of the core curve  @xmath5 ( for instance , the region @xmath40 ) . in this region ,",
    "if @xmath41 is a function that tends to zero as @xmath39 ( typically  @xmath42 or  @xmath43 ) , let us agree to say that a scalar quantity @xmath44 is of order @xmath45 if    [ defo ] @xmath46 .",
    "likewise , given a nonnegative integer  @xmath47 we will say that @xmath44 is of order @xmath48 if @xmath49 and uniformly in @xmath15 .",

    "as the vector field @xmath59 has norm @xmath15 , it follows from the expression   for the volume in the coordinates @xmath61 that the surface measure of @xmath17 can be written as @xmath65 with @xmath66 . hence the field  @xmath34 is indeed divergence - free on  @xmath17 , since the usual formula for the divergence yields",

    "this readily yields @xmath77 an analogous reasoning can obviously be applied to the derivatives of @xmath78 , so equation   follows .",
