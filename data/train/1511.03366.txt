    "magnetization switching in a ferromagnet has been an important topic in magnetism from the viewpoints of both fundamental physics and practical applications .",
    "the magnetization switching has been achieved by applying a direct magnetic field to a ferromagnet [ ] . in this case",
    ", the field magnitude should be larger than the anisotropy field @xmath0 , where , throughout this paper , we focus on the magnetization switching having an uniaxial anisotropy .",
    "recent advances in fabrication of nanostructured ferromagnets with high-@xmath0 materials however have required alternative methods for magnetization switching because of the technical difficulty of applying a large magnetic field to such a small ferromagnet .",
    "spin transfer torque switching and microwave - assisted magnetization reversal are promising candidates as new methods for the magnetization switching .",
    "the spin transfer torque , or simply spin torque , is exerted on the magnetization by applying an electric current directly to a ferromagnetic multilayer consisting of a free and pinned layers [ ] .",
    "the typical value of the switching current by the spin torque is on the order of @xmath1 a/@xmath2 [ ] . on the other hand , in microwave - assisted magnetization reversal , microwaves with frequencies on the order of the ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) frequency efficiently supply energy to the ferromagnet , and reduce the direct field for switching .",
    "typically , the switching field is reduced by less than half of the anisotropy field [ ] .",
    "the proposal of spin torque [ ] drastically changed the theoretical view of magnetization switching from the switching due to a magnetic field .",
    "let us assume that the magnetization dynamics can be described by the macrospin model .",
    "then , the magnetization dynamics is regarded as a motion of a point particle in a potential having two energy minima . when a direct magnetic field is applied to the ferromagnet",
    ", the zeeman energy modifies the shape of the potential . for a field magnitude",
    "larger than @xmath0 , the number of the minima is reduced to one ; i.e. , the potential has only one stable state .",
    "then , the system finally moves to the stable state due to damping .",
    "this is the switching mechanism due to the magnetic field . on the other hand ,",
    "the shape of the potential is unchanged in the spin torque switching .",
    "the spin torque competes with the damping torque . for a sufficiently large current",
    ", the spin torque overcomes the damping torque , and then the magnetization switches its direction by climbing up the potential landscape .",
    "the microwave - assisted magnetization reversal provides an interesting theoretical example of the switching .",
    "it is convenient for understanding the switching mechanism to introduce a rotating frame [ ] . in this frame",
    ", the effect of the microwave is converted to an additional direct field pointing in the reversed direction .",
    "the additional field energetically stabilizes the switched state , and reduces the switching field . in this sense",
    ", the switching mechanism is similar to that due to a direct field .",
    "simultaneously however , the microwave provides a torque preventing the switching [ ] .",
    "similarly to the spin torque , the direction of this torque is expressed by a triple vector product .",
    "therefore , both the direct field effect and spin - torque - like effect coexist in the microwave - assisted magnetization reversal .",
    "note however that the former assists the switching while the latter does not .",
    "because of the competition between these two effects , the switching field in microwave - assisted magnetization reversal has a minimum at a certain microwave frequency ; see ref .",
    "[ ] and appendix [ sec : appendixd ] .    the spin torque switching has recently faced an unavoidable contradiction .",
    "it is desirable from the viewpoints of both fundamental and practical studies to reduce the spin torque switching current and enhance the thermal stability of the free layer simultaneously .",
    "since the switching current is proportional to the anisotropy field @xmath0 [ ] , the reduction of the switching current can be achieved by using materials having relatively low @xmath0 . however , using low-@xmath0 material leads to small thermal stability @xmath3 , where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are the saturation magnetization , volume of the free layer , and temperature , respectively .",
    "therefore , the reduction of the switching current and enhancement of the thermal stability is a trade - off problem . here , note that the above discussion on microwave - assisted magnetization reversal provides a possibility to solve the problem .",
    "let us consider the spin torque switching assisted by microwaves .",
    "we may find conditions of the microwave frequency to reduce the switching current , as in the case of the switching field in the microwave - assisted magnetization reversal .",
    "if the switching current is reduced under certain conditions , the method will be useful to satisfy both high thermal stability and low switching current simultaneously ; i.e. , the high thermal stability is guaranteed by using high-@xmath0 material while the switching current can be reduced by applying microwaves .",
    "numerical simulations have implied such a possibility [ ] .",
    "however , the switching mechanism , as well as the theoretical conditions to reduce the switching current , has not been fully understood yet .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a theoretical model of a magnetization switching by current and microwaves .",
    "the electric current gives the spin torque on the magnetization , while the circularly polarized microwave induces the oscillation similarly to the case of the microwave - assisted magnetization reversal .",
    "numerical simulation of the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation reveals that the switching current for a certain microwave frequency is significantly reduced compared with the switching caused solely by the electric current .",
    "in fact , the switching current can become even zero when the microwave frequency is optimized and the amplitude of the microwaves becomes relatively high .",
    "let us call the microwave frequency corresponding to the minimized switching currents the optimized frequency . to identify the optimized frequency , we develop a theory of the switching from the llg equation averaged over a constant energy curve .",
    "it is found that the switching current should be classified into four regions , depending on the values of the microwave frequencies .",
    "based on this analysis , we derive analytical formulas of the optimized frequency and the minimized switching current .",
    "it is found that the optimized frequency is smaller than the fmr frequency . both the optimized frequency and the minimized switching current decrease with increasing the amplitude of the microwave field .",
    "the results indicate a possibility to simultaneously satisfy the requirements of high thermal stability and low switching current ; i.e. , using high-@xmath0 material guarantees high thermal stability while the application of microwaves reduces the switching current .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
