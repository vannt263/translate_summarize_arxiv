    "in the theory of gravitational radiation , it remains true what r. sachs stressed in his 1963 les houches lectures , i.e. that we understand the following three main features @xcite : 0.3 cm ( i ) we can give a description of radiation at large distances from its sources in an asymptotically flat universe ; this description is geometrically elegant and sufficiently detailed to analyze all conceptual experiments concerning the behaviour of test particles or test absorbers in the far field . 0.3 cm ( ii ) how the exact theory relates the far field to the near field and the sources or non - gravitational fields .",
    "0.3 cm ( iii ) we have approximation methods that make it possible to obtain numerical results for the amount of radiation emitted in a particular situation , or for scattering cross - sections , etc .",
    "; these approximation methods do not have a profound geometrical nature , but are very important in comparing theory with the experiment , in case the latter succeeds in finding observational evidence in favour of gravitational waves .",
    "0.3 cm within this framework , it is often desirable to use green - function methods , since the construction of suitable inverses of differential operators lies still at the very heart of many profound properties in classical and quantum field theory .",
    "for example , the theory of small disturbances in local field theory can only be built if suitable invertible operators are considered @xcite . in a functional - integral formulation , these correspond to the gauge - field and ghost operators , respectively @xcite .",
    "moreover , the peierls bracket on the space of physical observables , which is a poisson bracket preserving the invariance under the full infinite - dimensional symmetry group of the theory , is obtained from the advanced and retarded green functions of the theory via the supercommutator function @xcite and leads possibly to a deeper approach to quantization .",
    "last , but not least , a perturbation approach to classical general relativity relies heavily on a careful construction of green functions of operators of hyperbolic @xcite and elliptic @xcite type .",
    "in particular , following @xcite , we shall be concerned with the axisymmetric collision of two black holes travelling at the speed of light , each described in the centre - of - mass frame before the collision by an impulsive plane - fronted shock wave with energy @xmath0 .",
    "one then passes to a new frame to which a large lorentz boost is applied .",
    "there the energy @xmath1 of the incoming shock @xmath2 obeys @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the energy of the incoming shock @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( @xmath7 being the usual relativistic parameter ) . in the boosted frame , to the future of the strong shock @xmath2 , the metric can be expanded in the form @xcite @xmath8 , \\label{(1.1)}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the standard notation for the minkowski metric .",
    "the task of solving the einstein field equations becomes then a problem in singular perturbation theory , having to find @xmath10 by solving the linearized field equations at first , second , ... order respectively in @xmath11 , once that characteristic initial data are given just to the future of the strong shock @xmath2 .",
    "the perturbation series ( 1.1 ) is physically relevant because , on boosting back to the centre - of - mass frame , it is found to give an accurate description of space - time geometry where gravitational radiation propagates at small angles away from the forward symmetry axis @xmath12 .",
    "the news function @xmath13 ( see appendix ) , which describes gravitational radiation arriving at future null infinity in the centre - of - mass frame , is expected to have the convergent series expansion @xcite @xmath14 with @xmath15 a suitable retarded time coordinate , and @xmath0 the energy of each incoming black hole in the centre - of - mass frame . in @xcite a very useful analytic expression of @xmath16 was derived , exploiting the property that perturbative field equations may all be reduced to equations in only two independent variables , by virtue of a remarkable conformal symmetry at each order in perturbation theory . the green function for perturbative field equations",
    "was then found by reduction from the retarded flat - space green function in four dimensions .",
    "however , a _",
    "direct _ approach to the evaluation of green functions appears both desirable and helpful in general , and it has been our aim to pursue such a line of investigation . for this purpose , following hereafter our work in @xcite , reduction to two dimensions with the associated hyperbolic operator is studied again in section 2 .",
    "section 3 performs reduction to canonical form with the associated riemann function .",
    "equations for the goursat problem obeyed by the riemann function are derived in section 4 , while the corresponding numerical algorithm is discussed in section 5 .",
    "some backgound material is described in the appendix .",
    "as is well known from the work in @xcite and @xcite , the field equations for the first - order correction @xmath17 in the expansion ( 1.1 ) are particular cases of the general system given by the flat - space wave equation ( here @xmath18 ) @xmath19 supplemented by the boundary condition @xmath20 , \\label{(2.2)}\\ ] ] @xmath21 moreover , @xmath22 should be of the form @xmath23 for @xmath24 , where @xmath25 @xmath26 for the homogeneous wave equation ( 2.1 ) there is no advantage in eliminating @xmath27 and @xmath28 from the differential equation . however , the higher - order metric perturbations turn out to obey inhomogeneous flat - space wave equations of the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a source term equal to @xmath31 .",
    "this leads to the following equation for @xmath32 : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is an hyperbolic operator in the independent variables @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and takes the form @xcite @xmath37 the proof of hyperbolicity of @xmath34 , with the associated normal hyperbolic form , can be found in section 3 of @xcite , and in @xcite .",
    "the advantage of studying eq .",
    "( 2.7 ) is twofold : to evaluate the solution at some space - time point one has simply to integrate the product of @xmath38 and the green function @xmath39 of @xmath34 : @xmath40 and the resulting numerical calculation of the solution is now feasible @xcite .    if one defines the variables @xmath41 the operator @xmath34 is turned into @xmath42 the operator @xmath43 is the ` sum ' of an elliptic operator in the @xmath44 variable and a two - dimensional wave operator ` weighted ' with the exponential @xmath45 , which is the main source of technical complications in these variables .",
    "it is therefore more convenient , in our general analysis , to reduce first eq .",
    "( 2.7 ) to canonical form , and then find an integral representation of the solution .",
    "reduction to canonical form means that new coordinates @xmath46 and @xmath47 are introduced such that the coefficients of @xmath48 and @xmath49 vanish . as is shown in @xcite , this",
    "is achieved if @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 the resulting formulae are considerably simplified if one defines @xmath53 the dependence of @xmath54 on @xmath55 and @xmath56 is obtained implicitly by solving the system @xcite @xmath57 @xmath58 this leads to the equation @xmath59 which can be cast in the form @xmath60 this suggests defining @xmath61 so that one first has to solve the transcendental equation @xmath62 to obtain @xmath63 , from which one gets @xmath64 on denoting by @xmath65 the left - hand side of eq . ( 3.10 ) , one finds that , in the plane @xmath66 , the right - hand side of eq . ( 3.10 ) is a line parallel to the @xmath67-axis , which intersects @xmath65 at no more than one point for each value of @xmath68 .",
    "for example , when @xmath69 , @xmath65 intersects the line taking the constant value @xmath2 , for which @xmath70 .",
    "the function @xmath71 is asymmetric and has the limiting behaviour described by @xmath72 @xmath73 thus , in the lower half - plane , @xmath74 has an horizontal asymptote given by the @xmath67-axis , and a vertical asymptote given by the line @xmath75 , while it has no asymptotes in the upper half - plane , since @xmath76 in addition to ( 3.13 ) .",
    "the first derivative of @xmath74 reads as @xmath77 one therefore has @xmath78 for all @xmath79 , and @xmath80 for all @xmath81 , and @xmath74 is monotonically decreasing for negative @xmath67 and monotonically increasing for positive @xmath67 .",
    "the point @xmath82 , at which @xmath83 vanishes , is neither a maximum nor a minimum point , because @xmath84 @xmath85 these formulae imply that @xmath86 but @xmath87 , and hence @xmath82 yields a flex of @xmath65 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    in the @xmath88 variables ,",
    "the operator @xmath34 therefore reads @xmath89 where , exploiting the formulae @xmath90 @xmath91 one finds @xmath92 , \\label{(3.20)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath93 , \\label{(3.21)}\\ ] ] @xmath94 .",

( 3.23 ) for arbitrary initial values given along an arbitrary non - characteristic curve @xmath107 , by means of a solution @xmath112 of the adjoint equation ( 3.29 ) which depends on @xmath123 and two parameters @xmath124 .",
    "unlike @xmath125 , the riemann function @xmath112 solves a characteristic initial - value problem .",
    "by fully exploiting the reduction to canonical form of eq .",
    "( 2.7 ) we have considered novel features with respect to the analysis in @xcite , because the riemann formula ( 3.33 ) also contains the integral along the piece of curve @xmath107 from @xmath108 to @xmath109 , and the term @xmath126 $ ] .",
    "this representation of the solution might be more appropriate for the numerical purposes considered in @xcite , but the task of finding the riemann function @xmath112 remains extremely difficult .",
    "one can however use approximate methods for solving eq .",
    "( 3.29 ) . for this purpose ,",
    "we first point out that , by virtue of eq .",
    "( 3.28 ) , eq . ( 3.29 ) is a canonical hyperbolic equation of the form @xmath127 where @xmath128 @xmath129 @xmath130 thus , on defining @xmath131 @xmath132 the equation ( 4.1 ) for the riemann function is equivalent to the hyperbolic canonical system @xcite @xmath133 @xmath134 where @xmath135 @xmath136 @xmath137 @xmath138 for the system described by eqs .",
    "( 4.7 ) and ( 4.8 ) with boundary data ( 3.34 ) and ( 3.35 ) an existence and uniqueness theorem holds ( see @xcite for the lipschitz conditions on boundary data ) , and we can therefore exploit the finite differences method to find approximate solutions for the riemann function @xmath104 , and eventually @xmath139 with the help of the integral representation ( 3.33 ) .",
    "the inverses of hyperbolic operators @xcite and the cauchy problem for hyperbolic equations with polynomial coefficients @xcite have always been the object of intensive investigation in the mathematical literature .",
    "we have here considered the application of such issues to axisymmetric black hole collisions at the speed of light , relying on the work in @xcite .",
    "we have pointed out that , for the inhomogeneous equations ( 2.7 ) occurring in the perturbative analysis , the task of inverting the operator ( 2.8 ) can be accomplished with the help of the riemann integral representation ( 3.33 ) , after solving eq .",
    "( 4.1 ) for the riemann function .",
    "one has then to solve a characteristic initial - value problem for a homogeneous hyperbolic equation in canonical form in two independent variables , for which we have developed formulae to be used for the numerical solution with the help of a finite differences scheme .",
    "for this purpose one studies the canonical system ( cf ( 4.7 ) and ( 4.8 ) ) @xmath140 @xmath141 in the rectangle @xmath142 , y \\in [ y_{0},y_{0}+b ] \\right \\}$ ] with known values of @xmath143 on the vertical side @xmath144 where @xmath145 , and known values of @xmath146 on the horizontal side @xmath147 where @xmath148 . the segments @xmath147 and @xmath144 are then divided into @xmath149 and @xmath150 equal parts , respectively . on setting @xmath151 and @xmath152 ,",
    "the original differential equations become equations relating values of @xmath143 and @xmath146 at three intersection points of the resulting lattice , i.e. @xmath153 @xmath154 it is now convenient to set @xmath155 , so that these equations read as @xmath156 @xmath157 thus , if both @xmath143 and @xmath146 are known at @xmath158 , one can evaluate @xmath143 at @xmath159 and @xmath146 at @xmath160 .",
    "the evaluation at subsequent intersection points of the lattice goes on along horizontal or vertical segments . in the former case , the resulting algorithm is @xmath161 @xmath162 while in the latter case one obtains the algorithm expressed by the equations @xmath163 @xmath164 stability of such solutions is closely linked with the geometry of the associated characteristics , and the criteria to be fulfilled are studied in section 13.2 of @xcite ( stability depends crucially on whether or not @xmath165 ) .    to sum up ,",
    "one solves numerically eq .",
    "( 3.10 ) for @xmath166 , from which one gets @xmath167 with the help of ( 3.11 ) , which is a fractional linear transformation .",
    "this yields @xmath168 and @xmath169 as functions of @xmath88 according to ( 3.24)(3.27 ) , and hence @xmath170 and @xmath107 in the equation for the riemann function are obtained according to ( 4.2)(4.4 ) , where derivatives with respect to @xmath55 and @xmath56 are evaluated numerically .",
    "eventually , the system given by ( 4.7 ) and ( 4.8 ) is solved according to the finite - differences scheme of the present section , with @xmath171 @xmath172 once the riemann function @xmath173 is obtained with the desired accuracy , numerical evaluation of the integral ( 3.33 ) yields @xmath139 , and @xmath174 is obtained upon using eqs .",
    "( 3.5 ) and ( 3.6 ) for the characteristic coordinates .",
    "our steps are conceptually desirable since they rely on well established techniques for the solution of hyperbolic equations in two independent variables @xcite , and provide a viable alternative to the numerical analysis performed in @xcite , because all functions should be evaluated numerically .",
    "our method is not obviously more powerful than the one used in @xcite , but is well suited for a systematic and lengthy numerical analysis , while its analytic side provides an interesting alternative for the evaluation of green functions both in black hole physics and in other problems where hyperbolic operators with variable coefficients might occur .",
    "this task remains very important because a strong production of gravitational radiation is mainly expected in the extreme events studied in @xcite and which motivated our paper .",
    "any viable way of looking at mathematical and numerical aspects of the problem is therefore of physical interest for research planned in the years to come @xcite .",
    "in our expository article , we find it appropriate to include some background material , following , for example , the presentation in section iv of @xcite .",
    "we therefore consider some four - dimensional region of space - time and choose in it a set of null hypersurfaces @xmath175 ; the corresponding ray congruence with tangent vector @xmath176 is assumed to have expansion @xmath177 , which can always be arranged in a space - time patch , whereas outside of some patch the rays start to cross and hence our construction breaks down globally . on completing the @xmath178 direction to a quasi - normal tetrad @xmath179 ,",
    "one finds the following split of the vacuum einstein equations with einstein tensor @xmath180 :    main equations ( 6 equations ) @xmath181 trivial equation @xmath182 and 3 supplementary conditions @xmath183 where a single complex equation has been counted as two real equations .",
    "remarkably , if the main equations hold everywhere , then the trivial equation holds everywhere and the supplementary conditions hold everywhere if they hold at one point on each ray .",
    "the fulfillment of the trivial equation is proved by writing , from the vacuum einstein equations , that @xmath184 and then exploiting the main equations ( a1 ) jointly with the split of @xmath185 as given in @xcite : @xmath186 hence one gets @xmath187 by hypothesis the expansion @xmath27 does not vanish , so that the trivial equation is , indeed , identically satisfied .",
    "the fulfillment of ( a3 ) everywhere is proved along similar lines .",
    "thus , one can again integrate the main equations ( a1 ) first and worry about the supplementary conditions ( a3 ) later .",
    "choose now the coordinate @xmath188 as the retarded time : @xmath189 .",
    "let @xmath190 be a luminosity distance along the rays ; let @xmath191 ( with @xmath192 ) be any other pair of coordinates constant along the rays .",
    "the line element in these coordinates takes therefore the form ( no confusion should arise with the @xmath7 of section 1 ) @xmath193 where @xmath194 depend on the @xmath191 coordinates . since @xmath36 is a luminosity distance ,",
    "the determinant of @xmath195 is independent of @xmath36 .",
    "bearing in mind that the luminosity distance is defined only up to a factor constant along each ray , one can demand without loss of generality that ( here @xmath196 ) @xmath197 the metric corresponding to the line element ( a7 ) contains only six unknown functions of four variables , and our coordinate system is ` rigid ' enough for our purposes @xcite .",
    "one can either analyze the field in the neighbourhood of some point , or the field near infinity in an asymptotically flat space - time .",
    "indeed , if in minkowski space - time one uses a retarded time @xmath198 and spherical coordinates @xmath199 one finds for the line element @xmath200 hence one is led to require that , if asymptotic flatness holds , @xmath201 where all limits are taken as @xmath36 approaches infinity with @xmath202 fixed . the second requirement in ( a10 ) , i.e. that all quantities of interest admit a power - series expansion in @xmath203 , e.g. @xmath204 is indeed restrictive .",
    "such a requirement can be drastically weakened but not fully eliminated ; moreover , it is closely related to an outgoing radiation condition of the sommerfeld type .",
    "it should be stressed that all these requirements no longer hold when @xmath36 becomes small to the extent that rays start to cross each other .    in the axially- and reflection - symmetric case considered by bondi et al .",
    "@xcite , one has @xmath205 and the @xmath28-direction is a hypersurface - orthogonal killing direction .",
    "the line element acquires the simpler form @xmath206 , \\label{(a13)}\\ ] ] where the peculiar form of the first coefficient is chosen to simplify the resulting calculations .",
    "interestingly , two main equations are found to be identically satisfied by virtue of axial symmetry , whereas the other four turn out to be linear combinations of @xcite @xmath207 @xmath208}_{1 } -2r^{2}\\biggr(-\\gamma_{12}+2\\gamma_{1}\\gamma_{2}-2\\gamma_{1 } \\cot \\theta + \\beta_{12}-2{\\beta_{2}\\over r}\\biggr)=0 , \\label{(a15)}\\ ] ] @xmath209=0 , \\label{(a16)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath210=0 . \\label{(a17)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equations ( a14)(a16 ) are called _ hypersurface equations _ because they contain no @xmath211 derivatives , while eq .",
