    "quantum chromodynamics , the field theory of the strong interaction , is an asymptotically free theory , i.e. the coupling constant decreases as the energy increases . on the other hand , at low energies",
    "the coupling constant becomes too large to make an expansion in it ; qcd becomes non - perturbative . besides lattice calculations , the effective field theory is the only systematic approach to deal with the low - energy dynamics of qcd .",
    "the symmetry of the qcd lagrangian in the chiral limit ( i.e. at vanishing quark masses ) is supposed to be broken spontaneously leading to massless goldstone bosons by virtue of the goldstone theorem . depending on whether the s - quark is considered as light or not , these goldstone bosons may be identified either as the pseudoscalar octet or as the three pions . since chiral symmetry",
    "is explicitly broken by non - zero quark masses the goldstone bosons are not exactly massless but anyhow relatively light compared to @xmath0 , the typical scale of qcd . at low energies they are the fundamental degrees of freedom , whose dynamics is dictated by symmetry constraints .",
    "this leads to the effective field theory of qcd , chiral perturbation theory , formulated in its modern form by weinberg , gasser and leutwyler .    here",
    ", we consider the s - quark as heavy and deal with pions only . in the pure mesonic sector",
    "the ground state is a constant pionic field configuration .",
    "as we will discuss , the pions may be represented by a four - dimensional unit vector , such that the ground state just stands for a constant vector field .",
    "however , chiral perturbation theory may be extended to include also baryons ( nucleons in the case where the s - quark is considered as heavy ) .",
    "this makes it possible to effectively describe the interactions between one nucleon and pions .",
    "it turns out that the fermion may lower its energy if the vector field representing the pions is not constant but varies throughout space .",
    "this behavior increases the pionic energy and for low nucleon densities this rise of the pionic energy outweighs the decrease of the fermionic energy .",
    "however , if we do not consider one nucleon only but a many - particle system ( neglecting interactions between the fermions ) and if the particle number density of nucleons exceeds some critical value the dropping of the fermionic energy becomes so large that the many - particle system may lower its total energy density by changing the pionic configuration from the homogeneous to an inhomogeneous phase .    in this thesis",
    "we investigate whether it is possible that the vector field representing the pions could show a spiral phase in the ground state if we take nucleons into account .",
    "the physical parameter we can control is the density of nucleons . in the framework of chiral perturbation theory",
    "we calculate the energy of a spiral configuration ( to be introduced in section [ sec : aspiralconfiguration ] ) and try to find out what critical value the fermionic particle number density must exceed for the spiral phase instead of the homogeneous phase to be favored .",
    "the spiral configuration we consider is such that the nucleons see a constant background . ] , which simplifies the solution of the dirac equation .",
    "the idea of this thesis actually originates from the theoretical description of quantum antiferromagnets .",
    "antiferromagnets doped with either electrons or holes are nowadays the only known approach to high temperature superconductors and have therefore been studied also from the theoretical point of view intensely .",
    "there are different models for the description of quantum antiferromagnets on the microscopic level .",
    "the most important are the so called hubbard and @xmath1 model . however , currently these models can be simulated numerically only if they contain at most one single hole or electron . additionally , due to severe fermion sign problems and other complications it is not possible to find the exact ground states of the two doped models , neither analytically nor numerically .    for these reasons one constructs a low energy ( low temperature )",
    "effective theory for antiferromagnets , i.e. as in the case of qcd one considers only the low energy regime and the degrees of freedom appearing there . at low energies , the spin symmetry of the microscopic model",
    "is spontaneously broken giving rise to two massless goldstone bosons ( magnons ) that can be represented by a three dimensional unit vector @xmath2 , the so called local staggered magnetization .",
    "an effective theory in terms of @xmath2 for the pure antiferromagnet , i.e. for the magnon sector without holes or electrons , was developed by hasenfratz and niedermayer in @xcite .",
    "considering the effective action therein it becomes clear that the ground state of the antiferromagnet at low energies corresponds to a constant staggered magnetization .    like chiral perturbation theory",
    "may be extended to include baryons , doped holes ( @xcite ) and doped electrons ( @xcite ) in the antiferromagnet may also be described effectively . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that through an inhomogeneous staggered magnetization , namely a spiral configuration , ( which costs energy in the magnon sector ) doped holes can lower their energy in such a way that the total energy of the system may get lower than in the case of a constant staggered magnetization .",
    "depending on the values of the low energy constants and the density of holes , spiral configurations are hence a certain category of configurations that may then describe the ground state .",
    "due to the similarities of the two effective field theories , one for qcd and one for antiferromagnets , it was natural to ask whether the corresponding phenomenon to spiral phases observed in antiferromagnets could occur also in qcd .",
    "the answer to this question is positive .",
    "however , as we will show , the critical particle number density for the spiral phase to occur will turn out to lie in the region of nuclear matter density . it is anything but obvious whether chiral perturbation theory remains valid at such high densities . in order to check the reliability of our results",
    "we investigate higher orders ( in different ways ) and calculate the corrections coming from these .",
    "if they are not too large we might get a reason to trust the results and to believe that the qualitative picture may be correct . due to these uncertainties we will not calculate errors for the critical number densities originating from errors of the low energy constants .",
    "the calculations are performed using the low energy constants obtained in the chiral limit , but in order to analyze the sensitivity of the results with respect to higher orders we also do the calculations with the physical low energy constants .",
    "the presence of a spiral configuration could be viewed as the phenomenon of pion condensation .",
    "this is supposed to occur in superdense matter like e.g. in nuclear matter or inside a neutron star .",
    "spiral configurations in the mesonic vacuum could therefore be an alternative approach towards such phenomena .",
    "this chapter is intended to give a brief summary of chiral perturbation theory as the effective theory of qcd .",
    "more detailed introductions can be found in @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) reads @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the flavor index , @xmath5 a triplet of spinors ( red , green and blue quarks ) , @xmath6 is the covariant derivative with the eight gluon fields @xmath7 , the strong coupling constant @xmath8 and the gell - mann matrices @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the field tensor for the vector potentials , i.e. the kinetic term for the gluons with the @xmath11 structure constants @xmath12 . we have adopted feynman s notation @xmath13 . since qcd is a non - abelian theory ( @xmath14 ) the gluons carry the same color charge as the quarks and thus may interact with each other .",
    "the structure of qcd is therefore much more complicated than that of qed and , what is more important , due to the non - abelian nature qcd is an asymptotically free theory , i.e. the @xmath15 function @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 is the renormalization scale , i.e. the typical energy ) is negative .",
    "function of qcd would be positive only if the number of quark flavors exceeded sixteen .",
    "] this means that , in contrast to qed , the coupling constant decreases with increasing energy . since at low energies",
    "the strong coupling constant becomes quite large , perturbation theory , i.e. an expansion in the coupling constant , is possible only for high energies but will fail in the low energy regime .",
    "only two rigorous approaches are known to treat the strong interaction at low energies : lattice qcd and the effective field theory called chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) .",
    "effective field theories ( efts ) are a very important tool in many areas of physics .",
    "the motivation for an eft is that one does not have to know a theory at all energy scales in order to precisely describe a physical system . in general , efts are low energy approximations of a fundamental theory and allow an expansion of physical quantities in terms of @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes momenta or masses being smaller than some scale @xmath20 ( therefore an expansion is possible ) .",
    "the basis of efts is a statement given by weinberg and proved by leutwyler ( @xcite ) as well as dhoker and weinberg ( @xcite ) , which says that a quantum field theory has no content beyond unitarity , analyticity , cluster decomposition and symmetries .",
    "unitarity assures that @xmath21 ( @xmath4 : final state , @xmath22 : initial state ) and analyticity guarantees causality .",
    "the cluster decomposition theorem guarantees locality and states , in few words , that two experiments done in sufficiently separated regions of space - time do not correlate . finally , by symmetry",
    "we mean poincar invariance , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 symmetries and internal symmetries like e.g. isospin symmetry .",
    "weinberg s statement means that a perturbative description in terms of the most general effective lagrangian containing all possible terms compatible with assumed symmetry principles yields the most general @xmath26 matrix consistent with the fundamental principles mentioned above .",
    "hence , an effective lagrangian is constructed by writing down all possible terms allowed by the symmetry properties of the underlying theory . of course",
    ", this will be an infinite number of terms and we need some method of assessing the importance of diagrams generated by the interaction terms of this lagrangian . in chpt",
    "this will be weinberg s power counting scheme ( see section [ sec : weinbergpowercounting ] ) .",
    "there are different types of efts ( see e.g. @xcite ) depending on the structure of the transition from the fundamental ( energies @xmath27 ) to the effective ( energies @xmath28 ) level :    * decoupling : if we have a theory in which there are light and heavy degrees of freedom which are well separated by a scale @xmath20 and if we only consider energies well below @xmath20 , then the heavy degrees of freedom will not matter .",
    "we can integrate them out of the generating functional and get a lagrangian with the light degrees of freedom only ( appelquist - carazzone theorem , see @xcite ) .",
    "this effective lagrangian will contain a renormalizable part and non - renormalizable couplings which are suppressed by inverse powers of @xmath20 .",
    "an example for such an eft might be the standard model ( as an eft of a yet unknown fundamental theory ) . * non - decoupling :",
    "due to some phase transition the degrees of freedom at low energy differ from the ones of the underlying theory .",
    "this is the case in qcd where the phase transition is spontaneous symmetry breaking of chiral symmetry . in the low energy regime",
    "we only deal with color - neutral hadronic states which will be the goldstone bosons in the mesonic sector ( originating from spontaneous symmetry breaking ) and nucleons in the baryonic sector .",
    "an effective lagrangian of that sort will not be renormalizable in the classical sense .",
    "the reason is that it contains infinitely many terms and due to the nonlinear transformation properties of the goldstone bosons even the lowest order effective lagrangian contains infinitely many fields . to get a dimensionless action we thus need coupling constants of negative mass dimensionality .",
    "but such interactions are not renormalizable .",
    "however , this is not regarded as a serious problem since the infinities arising from loops in a given order of momentum expansion are absorbed in a renormalization of ( a finite number of ) coefficients in the lagrangian .",
    "so the effective lagrangian is renormalizable order by order .",
    "going from the fundamental to an effective level we lose track of the correct high energy behavior of the theory .",
    "an eft will yield wrong results if the energy is too high and e.g. heavier degrees of freedom are produced .",
    "thus the domain of utility of an eft is necessarily bounded from above in the energy scale .",
    "the effective coupling constants , i.e. the coefficients appearing in the effective lagrangian , can not be determined by symmetry considerations alone but should in principle be calculated from the fundamental theory . in the case of chpt",
    "we can not ( yet ) solve the fundamental theory ( qcd ) and the effective couplings stay as free parameters which have to be determined by some other means , e.g. matched by experiments .",
    "since symmetry and symmetry breaking are the basic concepts in the construction of an effective lagrangian we shall study the symmetries of the qcd lagrangian in some detail .",
    "due to the confinement of quarks into hadronic states the notion of quark masses is rather complicated and needs some extended discussion .",
    "however , without going into details , e.g. the particle physics booklet @xcite tells us that there are three light ( u , d and s ) and three heavy ( c , b and t ) quarks . the masses of the light quarks are quite below @xmath0 and the heavy quarks exceed this scale .",
    "@xmath0 is the typical scale of qcd and is associated with the masses of the lightest hadrons containing light quarks that are not goldstone bosons ( e.g. @xmath29mev ) . for spontaneous symmetry breaking the typical scale is @xmath30gev ( see e.g. @xcite ) , which is of the same order .",
    "if we constrain ourselves to energies below @xmath0 there will never appear any states containing heavy quarks and we can ignore them in the lagrangian , i.e. we set their masses to infinity .",
    "if we compare e.g. the mass of a proton ( @xmath31 ) with the sum of two up and one down quark we see that the quark masses contribute almost nothing and that the proton gets its mass through another complicated mechanism .",
    "this is the motivation to send the light quark masses to zero as a first approximation .",
    "this is the so - called chiral limit and the lagrangian ( [ eq : qcdlagr ] ) then reads @xmath32 spinors of massless or ultrarelativistic fermions are eigenstates of the chirality operator @xmath33 , where particles with eigenvalue @xmath34 are called right - handed and those with eigenvalue @xmath35 are called left - handed . in this extreme relativistic case chirality",
    "equals to helicity . defining the projection operators @xmath36 and @xmath37 we can decompose an arbitrary spinor into its right- and left - handed parts which then are eigenstates of @xmath38 .",
    "thus , with @xmath39 and @xmath40 we can then write ( [ eq : qcdlagr0 ] ) as @xmath41 we see that the right- and left - handed quark fields have completely decoupled .",
    "this is not the case if we have a mass term which mixes right- and left - handed fields .",
    "besides lorentz invariance , @xmath42 gauge invariance and @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath23 symmetries , the lagrangian ( [ eq : qcdlagr0rl ] ) shows also a chiral symmetry : it is invariant under global @xmath43 flavor transformations @xmath44 and @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are flavor triplets .",
    "since we can make the decomposition @xmath48 , we see that @xmath49 shows a global @xmath50 symmetry .      from these symmetries",
    "we get several conserved currents due to noether s theorem ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath51 symmetries will lead to the currents @xmath52 . by adding and subtracting respectively these currents we get a singlet vector and a singlet axialvector current ( according to to their behavior under parity transformation ) :",
    "@xmath53 the current @xmath54 can be interpreted as total current when doing the @xmath55 and @xmath56 transformation with the same phase , while @xmath57 comes from transformations with opposite phases ( if a @xmath58 transformation with phase @xmath59 yields the current @xmath60 , then a transformation with phase @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) leads to @xmath63 ) .    from @xmath54",
    "the conserved charge is given by @xmath64 which counts the number of quarks minus antiquarks ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus @xmath65 is the number @xmath66 of baryons and the @xmath67 symmetry simply expresses baryon number conservation and leads to a classification of hadrons into mesons ( @xmath68 ) and baryons ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the current @xmath57 is conserved only at the classical level .",
    "this symmetry is broken by quantization due to anomalies ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the interesting symmetry is @xmath70 which leads to eight left - handed and eight right - handed conserved currents : @xmath71 the charge operators read @xmath72 and are the generators of @xmath70 since they satisfy the commutation relations corresponding to the lie algebra of this group .",
    "again one considers the vector and axialvector linear combinations @xmath73 as well as @xmath74 note that the charge operators @xmath75 satisfy the commutation relations for @xmath76 , whereas @xmath77 do not form a closed algebra , i.e. the commutator of two axial charge operators is not again an axial charge operator and there is nothing like @xmath78 .",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking takes place if the lagrangian of a system has a given symmetry but the ground state is not invariant under that symmetry ; rather the system has chosen one of ( possibly many ) ground states , all related by symmetry transformations .",
    "a classical example is a ferromagnet described by spin - spin interaction , whose hamiltonian is invariant under rotations .",
    "however , below the critical temperature the ground state is one in which all the spins point in the same direction , which is surely not rotationally invariant .",
    "the direction of the spins is random ( in the absence of an external magnetic field ) , hence the system has infinitely many degenerated ground states .    as we saw",
    "that @xmath49 is invariant under @xmath79 , it is interesting to ask whether the ground state of qcd is invariant under the same symmetry group . to study this ,",
    "let @xmath80 be an eigenstate of @xmath81 with some energy @xmath82 and with positive parity , i.e. @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "then the state @xmath85 is also an eigenstate of @xmath81 with the same eigenvalue @xmath82 but with opposite parity : @xmath86 where we have used @xmath87=0 $ ] since @xmath77 is time independent and @xmath88 since @xmath77 is an axialvector .",
    "consequently , for any state of positive parity one would expect the existence of a degenerate state of negative parity",
    ". however , this is not observed in the low - energy spectrum of hadrons .",
    "though , for these arguments we ( not obviously ) assumed that the axial charges @xmath77 annihilate the ground state , i.e. @xmath89 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "but since there is no experimental evidence for parity doubling one concludes that the @xmath77 do not annihilate the vacuum , i.e. the ground state of qcd is not invariant under @xmath79 . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that in the chiral limit the ground state must be invariant under @xmath90 , i.e. the vector charges @xmath75 and @xmath91 annihilate the ground state ; @xmath92 .",
    "thus , while @xmath49 is invariant under @xmath79 , the ground state is invariant under @xmath90 only , which is spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "goldstone theorem states that for every spontaneously broken continuous symmetry , i.e. for every generator that does not annihilate the ground state , there is one particle of zero mass and spin in the spectrum .",
    "these are called goldstone bosons .",
    "let us consider a theory involving several fields @xmath93 , described by a lagrangian of the form @xmath94 .",
    "suppose that the potential @xmath95 has a set of degenerate ground states and that the system has chosen spontaneously one of them , let us call it @xmath96 .",
    "expanding @xmath97 about this minimum yields @xmath98 where the linear terms disappear since @xmath96 is a minimum .",
    "the coefficients @xmath99 define a symmetric matrix whose eigenvalues give the squared masses of the particle excitations above the ground state ( vacuum ) @xmath96 .",
    "this can be seen by performing an orthogonal transformation of the fields such that the mass matrix gets diagonal .",
    "since @xmath100 is a positive semidefinite matrix ( as @xmath96 is a minimum ) these eigenvalues can not be negative .",
    "we show now , that for every continuous symmetry of @xmath101 which is not a symmetry of @xmath96 the matrix @xmath100 yields a zero eigenvalue and we therefore have a massless particle .",
    "suppose that @xmath101 is invariant under a symmetry group @xmath102 of order @xmath103 ( thus @xmath102 having @xmath103 generators ) while @xmath96 is invariant under a subgroup @xmath104 of order @xmath105 only . under @xmath102",
    "an infinitesimal symmetry transformation of the fields takes the form @xmath106 where @xmath107 are the representation matrices of the generators of @xmath102 . since the potential @xmath95 is invariant under @xmath102 , we have @xmath108 which yields @xmath109 differentiating with respect to @xmath110 and evaluating the resulting expression at @xmath111 we get @xmath112 since the equation holds for every @xmath113 .",
    "this can be written more compactly as @xmath114 .",
    "this equation is trivially fulfilled if @xmath115 , i.e. if @xmath107 is a generator of the subgroup @xmath116 , because @xmath96 is invariant under @xmath116 and hence @xmath117 .",
    "but for @xmath118 , i.e. for the generators belonging to @xmath102 but not to @xmath116 , we have @xmath119 , since @xmath96 is not invariant under the full group @xmath102 .",
    "then the above equation tells us that @xmath120 is an eigenvector of @xmath121 with eigenvalue zero .",
    "thus the matrix has @xmath122 zero eigenvalues and therefore there are @xmath122 massless particles ( goldstone bosons ) in the spectrum .",
    "these goldstone bosons carry the same quantum numbers as the generators that do not annihilate the vacuum .",
    "furthermore , it follows ( see @xcite ) that the matrix element of the symmetry currents @xmath123 that lead to the generators of @xmath102 not annihilating the ground state between the vacuum and the massless one - particle states @xmath124 is non - zero , @xmath125 using this , it can be shown that , in the chiral limit , the goldstone bosons do not interact with each other at zero momentum ( see .",
    "e.g. @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "this feature is essential for the consistency of chpt ; otherwise the power counting of chpt ( see [ sec : weinbergpowercounting ] ) would break down .      remembering the example of the ferromagnet below the critical temperature",
    ", we see that , as soon as the symmetry of the system has broken down spontaneously , the magnetization @xmath126 becomes non - zero .",
    "@xmath126 can therefore be identified as an order parameter of the system . in a similar manner",
    "we can detect a spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry by investigating the scalar quark condensate @xmath127 which is the order parameter of qcd ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a non - zero value of this order parameter in the chiral limit is a sufficient ( but not necessary ) condition for spontaneous symmetry breaking in qcd ( see @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "if the axial charges @xmath128 do not annihilate the vacuum it is consistent to assume that @xmath129 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "as we have 8 generators @xmath128 which do not annihilate the ground state , goldstone s theorem now allows us to conclude that there must be 8 massless pseudoscalar particles @xmath124 whose coupling to the currents @xmath130 is non - vanishing : @xmath131 this form of the matrix element comes from symmetry considerations : due to translational invariance we have @xmath132 and the only quantity in question bearing a lorenz index is the momentum @xmath133 of the pseudoscalar state .",
    "the constant of proportionality @xmath134 is called the pion - decay constant in the chiral limit .",
    "it measures the strength with which the goldstone boson @xmath135 decays via the axial vector current into the hadronic vacuum .    acting in ( [ eq : matrixelement ] ) on both sides with @xmath136",
    "we conclude that , in the chiral limit ( where @xmath137 ) , the goldstone bosons are indeed massless : @xmath138      since in the chiral limit of qcd we suppose a spontaneous symmetry breakdown from @xmath79 to @xmath90 and since @xmath11 has eight generators , we expect 8 massless goldstone bosons .",
    "their symmetry properties are tightly connected to the generators which are responsible for them , i.e. to those which do not annihilate the vacuum . in qcd",
    "this are , as seen above , the axial generators @xmath77 .",
    "thus the goldstone bosons are , as already mentioned , expected to transform with a negative sign under parity and hence to be pseudoscalars .",
    "indeed , the spectrum of qcd shows eight candidates for the goldstone bosons , namely the pseudoscalar octet @xmath139 .",
    "these particles are of course not massless but this is interpreted as a consequence of the explicit breaking of chiral symmetry due to finite u- , d- and s - quark masses in the lagrangian ( [ eq : qcdlagr ] ) .",
    "e.g. in @xcite the resulting masses of the goldstone bosons are calculated ( the results are quoted in section [ sec : effectivelagrangian ] ) . nonetheless , the goldstone bosons of qcd are much lighter than all other hadrons .",
    "this statement becomes even more accurate if we restrict ourselves only to u- and d - quarks and neglect the s - quark ( which is considerably heavier than the u- and d - quarks ) in the lagrangian , i.e. we only consider energies where states including s - quarks never appear",
    ". then @xmath49 shows an @xmath140 symmetry which breaks down to @xmath141 , resulting in three goldstone bosons , as @xmath142 has three generators .",
    "these are then the pions which , since the u- and d - quarks are indeed very light and thus the chiral limit is a better approximation than in the case of @xmath11 , show strikingly small masses ( about @xmath143mev for @xmath144 and about @xmath145mev for @xmath146 ) .      since in qcd at low energies",
    "the goldstone bosons are the only degrees of freedom , this are the objects to be contained in an effective lagrangian .",
    "let us denote the symmetry group of the lagrangian by @xmath102 and the smaller symmetry group of the ground state by @xmath116 .",
    "due to spontaneous symmetry breaking we have @xmath147 goldstone bosons @xmath148 which we collect in the vector @xmath149 .",
    "the set of all these vectors is a vector space , let us call it @xmath150 .",
    "we can define the action of the symmetry group @xmath102 on @xmath150 by a mapping @xmath151 with @xmath152 this defines an operation of @xmath102 on @xmath150 if the mapping @xmath153 satisfies @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the identity of @xmath102 .",
    "since the subgroup @xmath116 leaves the ground state @xmath156 invariant we have @xmath157 for all @xmath158 and hence @xmath159 this shows that for all elements of a given coset @xmath160 of @xmath8 , @xmath153 maps the origin onto the same vector in @xmath150 .",
    "furthermore , this mapping is injective ; one simply shows that for two elements @xmath8 and @xmath161 of @xmath102 with @xmath162 it follows @xmath163 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "so the mapping is bijective on the image of @xmath164 ( as it is automatically surjective on the image ) and can there be inverted .",
    "hence , to each @xmath165 corresponds a coset @xmath166 with appropriate @xmath167 such that @xmath168 .",
    "we have therefore found an isomorphic mapping between the set @xmath169 of all cosets and the goldstone boson fields .",
    "the set of all cosets is called quotient @xmath170 and therefore the goldstone boson fields are said to live on the coset space @xmath170 .",
    "the transformation behavior of a @xmath168 under a group element @xmath171 is easily found by applying @xmath172 : @xmath173 the coset corresponding to @xmath174 is thus obtained by multiplication of the coset corresponding to @xmath165 with @xmath8 .",
    "now , in the case of qcd we have @xmath175 and @xmath176 which is isomorphic to @xmath177 , with @xmath178 or @xmath179 depending on whether we include the s - quark or not .",
    "the coset of @xmath180 is @xmath181 and since we have @xmath182 it can be written as @xmath183 .",
    "hence the coset and therefore the goldstone bosons may be uniquely characterized through the @xmath184 matrix @xmath185 .",
    "its transformation behavior under an element @xmath186 is , as seen above , obtained by multiplication of the coset with @xmath8 : @xmath187 which yields @xmath188 this mapping defines a nonlinear realization of @xmath189 .",
    "one possible and convenient representation of the matrix @xmath190 is the exponential representation : @xmath191 where @xmath192",

    "this corresponds to the observations in nature as the hadrons organize themselves into approximately degenerate multiplets transforming under irreducible representations of @xmath184 .",
    "it is easily checked that the ground state @xmath198 and thus @xmath199 is invariant under @xmath177 , since in this case we have @xmath200 and ( [ eq : transform ] ) yields @xmath201 on the other hand @xmath202 is not invariant under axial transformations , i.e. for @xmath203 and @xmath204 ( corresponding to the case of opposite phases , see section [ sec : symmetrycurrents ] ) : @xmath205 just as we expect it due to spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "the transformation behavior of the goldstone boson fields @xmath206 may be verified to be that of a multiplet under @xmath177 .",

    "the only possible building block in @xmath209 is @xmath210 which contributes only a constant and can therefore be dropped .",

    "all possible green functions may be obtained via a generating functional depending on external fields and the ward identities are equivalent to the invariance of the generating functional under _ local _ transformations .    following gasser and leutwyler ,",
    "the qcd lagrangian is extended by coupling the quarks to external hermitian matrix fields ( @xmath258 matrices in flavor space ) @xmath259 , @xmath260 , @xmath261 and @xmath262 : @xmath263 the ordinary three flavor qcd lagrangian is recovered by setting @xmath264 and @xmath265 .",

    "to do so , the lagrangian ( [ eq : lagrangianexternalfields ] ) is split up in left- and right - handed parts , yielding @xmath271 where @xmath272 and @xmath273 .",

    "are contained in a covariant derivative @xmath276 which , under a local transformation @xmath277 , transforms in the same way as @xmath190 . beside this new building block",

    "it is therefore not straightforward to decide which eigenvalue belongs to which state .",

    ". it would therefore also be interesting to examine both steps at once , i.e. go to @xmath555 in the expansion of the energy eigenvalue and to include the terms of @xmath321 .",
    "let us have a look at the results that were obtained using @xmath551 .",
    "the two ways of going to higher orders just mentioned imply corrections of 21% and 15% respectively .",
    "these are more moderate than in the case of the physical pion mass . finally , in the chiral limit going to next order in the expansion of the fermionic energy yields an increase of the critical density of 1% while including @xmath321 causes a decrease of 8% .",
    "hence , the smaller the pion mass the smaller are the corrections .",
    "the corrections in the case of the physical pion mass should remind us to stay skeptical and that the numerical estimates we make are maybe not very reliable .",
    "however , they are nevertheless not too large and we may get confidence that the qualitative picture is correct .",
    "the spiral configuration we investigated in this thesis was an ansatz that allowed analytic solutions of the dirac equation .",
    "it is however by no means clear whether there is not another inhomogeneous pion configuration which could lower even more the total energy density of the many - particle system or which could happen at even smaller particle densities .",
    "hence , the numerical values we found in this thesis should be understood as upper bounds of critical densities for a transition to an inhomogeneous pion configuration to happen .",
    "what is the physical meaning of a spiral configuration we investigated ? if we believe our calculations , then already in ordinary nuclear matter the pionic vacuum could differ from the vacuum outside the volume of dense matter .",
    "it is therefore not possible to apply an appropriate gauge transformation in order to transform the pion field everywhere to @xmath805 and to establish the ground state of no pions .",
    "hence , observed from outside , inside the dense matter pions could appear , which is known as _",
    "pion condensation_. different from free pions , which decay in a rather short time , our configuration is static and the pions should be considered as a collective phenomenon rather than free particles . a comparison for this might be the neutron ; in the free case it decays after approximately 15 minutes , but as soon as it is enclosed in an atomic nucleus it turns out to be stable .",
    "pion condensation in dense matter has been studied by several authors using different approaches , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "although the structure of the interior of neutron stars . ] is not yet known in all details , there are models that include the phenomenon of pion condensation inside these superdense star remnants ( see e.g. @xcite )",
    ".    the results in this thesis might hence give some alternative ideas in an approach towards an explanation of pion condensation in nuclear matter and neutron stars .",
    "+ an interesting thing that could be done in further considerations is the analysis of higher order terms in the mesonic lagrangian ( see section [ sec : chirallagrangianorderp4 ] ) and going to even higher orders in the baryonic lagrangian . so far , the calculations at @xmath255 in the mesonic sector were only tree level calculations .",
    "this did not make it necessary to renormalize the low energy constants ; we could take them as fixed and more or less precisely known values .",
    "going to @xmath257 would however imply one - loop calculations with @xmath211 and tree level calculations with @xmath238 .",
    "it is an interesting question how one could then calculate the energy of the system . also if one goes to higher orders in the baryonic sector one will have to deal with loops .",
    "it is then by far not clear whether a hamiltonian as we constructed it is still a well defined object .",
    "an alternative way of finding the energy of a nucleon in the background of pions could be to consider its propagator .",
    "this could be calculated using a well defined lagrangian and it should be possible to make a conclusion for the nucleon energy via the pole of the propagator .",
    "another direction worth exploring is to switch on electromagnetic effects , i.e. to include virtual photons . beside the quark mass matrix",
    "the quark charge matrix is an alternative way of breaking chiral symmetry explicitly and it would be interesting to find out the order of magnitude of the effects arising therefrom .    in the case of antiferromagnets",
    "the transition from a homogeneous to a spiral phase of the staggered magnetization implies a spontaneous breaking of translation symmetry on the lattice .",
    "the consequence is a further goldstone boson ( helimagnon ) . in the case of qcd",

    "altogether we obtain @xmath937 consequently we have to split the integration in ( [ eq : nmitsvone ] ) and ( [ eq : emitsvone ] ) into two parts : @xmath938+\\int\\limits_{e_l}^{e_f^-}de\\;b_2(e)\\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & = \\frac{l^3m_n}{\\pi^2}\\left\\{\\int\\limits_{e_l'}^{e_f^-}de\\;b_2(e)-\\int\\limits_{e_l'}^{e_l}de\\;b_1(e)\\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\ n^{(2)}_-&=\\frac{m_n}{\\pi^2}\\left\\{\\int\\limits_{e_l'}^{e_f^-}de\\;b_2(e)-\\int\\limits_{e_l'}^{e_l}de\\;b_1(e)\\right\\}\\label{eq : nmiti2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath939+\\int\\limits_{e_l}^{e_f^-}de\\;e\\,b_2(e)\\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & = \\frac{l^3m_n}{\\pi^2}\\left\\{\\int\\limits_{e_l'}^{e_f^-}de\\;e\\,b_2(e)-\\int\\limits_{e_l'}^{e_l}de\\;e\\,b_1(e)\\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\ \\epsilon_\\text{tot}^{(2)-}&=\\frac{m_n}{\\pi^2}\\left\\{\\int\\limits_{e_l'}^{e_f^-}de\\;e\\,b_2(e)-\\int\\limits_{e_l'}^{e_l}de\\;e\\,b_1(e)\\right\\}.\\label{eq : fermionischeenergiefall2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now we have to repeat this calculation with @xmath940 . the only thing that changes",
    "is the function @xmath908 of ( [ eq : defvongvonp3 ] ) , which in the case of @xmath698 now reads ( let us denote it with a superscript + ):",
    "@xmath941 this function always has a maximum at @xmath645 only , i.e. we simply need to repeat the above first case .",

    "during its lifetime a star produces its energy mainly through the fusion reactions @xmath948 as soon as all the hydrogen is burned , gravitation compresses the helium until other fusion reaction start . with increasing diversity of possible nuclear reactions the synthesis of heavier nuclei",
    "is pushed further until most of the matter consists of fe , si and close - by elements .",
    "this is then the point where the fusion reactions stop and the thermal pressure can not compensate the gravitational pressure anymore . if the star has sufficient mass , the thereupon incipient contraction crushes the atomic structure resulting in a mixture of electrons and nuclei , where the electrons can be treated as an ideal fermi gas ( i.e. neglecting interactions between them ) in a first approximation .",
    "it is then the fermi pressure of the electrons that prevents the object ( called white dwarf ) from a further contraction .",
    "let us calculate this pressure by taking the electrons as degenerate fermi gas at @xmath436 .",
    "since we consider free electrons the dispersion relation of one electron is given by ( let us introduce factors of @xmath949 and @xmath950 in this section ) @xmath951 where @xmath952 is the electron mass and @xmath953 the electron momentum .",
    "( [ eq : particlenumberdensity ] ) gives the connection between the fermi momentum @xmath438 and the electron number density @xmath954 : @xmath955 at @xmath436 all states up to @xmath438 are filled and the total energy of the electrons is given by ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : totaleenergiepm ] ) ) @xmath956 where we have introduced the dimensionless momenta @xmath957 and the function @xmath958 the pressure @xmath959 then follows from the thermodynamical relation @xmath960 with @xmath436 , leading to @xmath961 . when taking the derivative of ( [ eq : neutronstartotelenergie ] ) with respect to @xmath97 we have to keep in mind , that @xmath962 also depends on @xmath97 ; due to ( [ eq : neutronstarfermiimpuls ] )",
    "we have @xmath963 with some constant @xmath23 .",
    "so we get @xmath964 leading to @xmath965 here we see why only the fermi pressure of the electrons is important .",
    "if the particles are non - relativistic ( @xmath966 ) the fermi pressure goes like @xmath967 , i.e. only the light electrons have an important contribution .",
    "as the electrons get relativistic the star becomes unstable , see below .",
    "we want to express @xmath959 as a function of the ( for simplicity constant ) matter density @xmath968 where @xmath969 is the mean number of nucleons ( of mass @xmath423 ) per electron and where the contribution of electrons to the matter density is neglected . solving ( [ eq : neutronstarichte ] ) for @xmath954 and plugging that into @xmath962 yields @xmath970 solving this for @xmath971 and setting @xmath972 we get some characteristic density @xmath973 ( which will turn out to be the typical density of a white dwarf star ) : @xmath974 since @xmath975 the case @xmath966 in ( [ eq : neutronstarfvonxf ] ) corresponds to @xmath976 , while @xmath977 means @xmath978 . expanding ( [ eq : neutronstarpe ] ) together with ( [ eq : neutronstarfvonxf ] ) in powers of @xmath962 and using ( [ eq : neutronstarxf ] ) we are thus led to @xmath979 with @xmath980 and @xmath981 containing the prefactors . in both cases",
    "we hence have a so called polytropic equation of state , i.e. a relation @xmath982 .",
    "a necessary condition for the stability of a star is however @xmath983 , which follows from an analysis of the total energy of the star when varying its radius . through",
    "the so called lane - emden function the case @xmath978 ( which means that the electrons become relativistic ) may be connected to the mass of the star as follows : @xmath984 where @xmath985 is known as the chandrasekhar mass limit . consequently ,",
    "as @xmath986 the star becomes unstable .",
    "for a white dwarf consisting of iron , @xmath987 and hence @xmath988 . already before reaching this mass",
    "limit the reaction @xmath989 starts to take place ( as soon as the fermi energy of the electrons exceeds the energy that is released in the @xmath15 decay , which is about @xmath990 ) , which implies a breakdown of the fermi pressure and a further collapse of the star .",
    "a typical white dwarf therefore has the approximately the mass of our sun and @xmath973 of ( [ eq : neutronstarrhoc ] ) is indeed the characteristic density of a white dwarf .",
    "here we talk about approximately two tons per cubic centimeter , while its radius corresponds roughly to that of the earth .    for a star of mass @xmath991 the fermi pressure of the electrons",
    "is not able to prevent the matter from further contraction .",
    "the denser the material the more protons and electrons are converted into neutrons via the reaction ( [ eq : neutronstarinversebeta ] ) .",
    "the neutrinos escape and what is left is an object that predominantly consists of neutrons ; a so called neutron star .",
    "it is then the fermi pressure of the neutrons that keep the object stable .",
    "hence , the above formulas may also be used for a neutron star if we replace @xmath952 by @xmath423 and set @xmath992 .",
    "the characteristic density of a neutron star is therefore @xmath993 which is about @xmath994 .",
    "accordingly , the particle number density of the neutrons is @xmath995 and is thus of the same order as in an atomic nucleus ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : nuclearmatterdensityinfm ] ) ) .",
    "the calculation of the mass and the radius of the neutron star with the methods used in the case of white dwarfs is however only possible for densities well below @xmath973 . in this region",
    "the radius of such a dense object can be estimated to be approximately @xmath996 . in order to find out the mass limit one has to go to higher densites , where relativistic corrections and other processes become important .",
    "different model calculations led to mass limits for neutron stars between @xmath997 and @xmath998 .",
    "if the mass of a star reaches this mass limit the neutrons become relativistic and the object unstable .",
    "then , the gravitational collapse ( most likely ) can not be stopped by anything and the star will form a black hole .",
