    "the subtle physics of 2d systems subjected to a parallel magnetic field has stimulated increasing interest over the last decade .",
    "historically , the selective coupling of the in - plane magnetic field to the electronic spin degree of freedom has been used to probe the influence of many body effects on the spin polarization and the ground state of the 2d electron gas ( 2-deg ) . in practice",
    ", the application of a parallel magnetic field progressively lifts the spin degeneracy of the fermi liquid until it becomes fully spin polarized . in transport experiments for example ,",
    "the associated reduction in the screening of charged impurities leads to an increase of the longitudinal resistance followed by a saturation or a ` kink ' signaling the complete spin polarization of the 2d system .",
    "@xcite the magnetic field @xmath0 required to achieve complete polarization is a subtle quantity depending on the magnetic field dependent susceptibility , which is itself renormalized by many body effects ( see e.g. ref .",
    "an examination of the dependence of @xmath0 on different physical parameters such as carrier density , disorder , and temperature , has mostly been carried out in si and p - gaas based 2d systems , leaving the otherwise widely investigated n - gaas 2deg relatively unexplored concerning these issues .",
    "however , it was recently emphasized that in non - ideal 2d systems which have a significant width , which is particularly relevant for n - gaas , the in - plane magnetic field also couples to the orbital motion , and can considerably modify the physics involved , changing the effective disorder of the system , @xcite even stabilizing new phases . @xcite it is therefore important to characterize the various physical effects generated by the presence of a parallel magnetic field , in order to gain a better understanding of the influence of electron - electron interactions on the ground state properties of the 2-deg .    in this work , we report on experiments where a large in - plane magnetic field is applied to a 2d _ electron _ gas in gaas , which reveal the interplay between disorder , spin and , orbital physics .",
    "transport measurements under parallel magnetic fields up to @xmath1  t show that , at sufficiently low electron density , the signatures of orbital , spin effects and localization coexist .",
    "such a coexistence of distinct phenomena in a 2d system has to our knowledge not been previously reported .",
    "the magnetoresistance kink , associated with the complete spin polarization of the 2-deg , is observed for magnetic fields up to @xmath2  t. the observed reduction of @xmath0 of more than 20  t with decreasing electron density ( and mobility ) is in good agreement with the predicted enhancement of the spin susceptibility at low density due to electron - electron interactions .",
    "however , the absolute value of @xmath0 remains 2 - 3 times smaller than the calculated value at @xmath3 for a disorder - free system , and extrapolate to @xmath4 at a large , non zero electron density .",
    "this behavior is attributed to the localization of electrons in our disordered 2-deg .",
    "@xmath0 shows a strong increase with temperature , consistent with a reduction of the spin susceptibility .",
    "a simple model yields an estimate of the density of delocalized states which is significantly smaller than the total electron density , confirming the role played by disorder in the observed phenomenon . in the frozen spin regime ,",
    "the resistivity @xmath5 dramatically increases with a @xmath6 dependence , in agreement with theory taking into account the orbital coupling to the parallel field .",
    "the sample studied here is a volume - doped al@xmath7ga@xmath8as / gaas heterojunction ( hj ) , patterned into a hall bar .",
    "the electron density @xmath9 was varied by the application of a gate voltage enabling us to tune the density between @xmath10 and @xmath11 so that the corresponding interaction parameter @xmath12 spans the range @xmath13 . at zero gate voltage",
    "the mobility is @xmath14 , and decreases down to @xmath15 in the low density regime ( see table  [ tab : table1 ] ) .",
    "the transport measurements were performed with a standard low frequency lock - in technique for temperatures between 1.17k and 4.2k , under magnetic fields up to 32 t produced by a resistive magnet .",
    "the 2d electron plane was aligned parallel to the magnetic field direction by using an in - situ rotation stage to minimize the hall voltage , with an accuracy estimated to be better than @xmath16 . in the geometry",
    "used , the current along the hall bar was always perpendicular to the applied magnetic field .",
    "the physical sample parameters are summarized for selected densities in table [ tab : table1 ] . here",

    "in fig.[fig1 ] , we plot the longitudinal resistivity @xmath5 as a function of the parallel magnetic field for different electron densities in the low density region . a number of different magnetic field regimes are observed over the range studied [ 0 - 32 t ] .",
    "the resistivity first increases as @xmath20 ( as observed in refs .",
    "[ ] ) until a kink emerges at a density - dependent magnetic field .",
    "this kink has been shown to be associated with the complete spin polarization of the system @xcite eventually achieved at sufficiently high parallel magnetic field .",
    "the rich physics lying behind this quantity will be discussed throughout this paper . in 2-deg s in si - mosfet s , in which a similar feature was first reported ,",
    "@xcite a saturation of the resistance is usually observed once full spin polarization occurs . here , the resistance does not saturate after the kink but smoothly increases before rising exponentially , a behavior we attribute to the non - negligible thickness of the 2-deg in gaas making orbital coupling to the parallel magnetic field possible .",
    "@xcite we stress this behaviour , which will be discussed in section [ sectioniiib ] , is qualitatively and quantitatively different from the initial @xmath20 increase .     as a function of the parallel magnetic field for different electron densities @xmath9 in @xmath21 .",

    "the magnetic field for full spin polarization is actually much smaller .",
    "the calculation of this quantity is a challenging task since it requires modelling electron - electron interactions in the strongly interacting regime .",

    "this reduction with decreasing density is in good agreement with the @xmath3 predictions of ref .",
    "[ ] , as well as the predictions of ref .",
    "[ ] , where @xmath0 also drops by about 20 t over the same density range .",
    "however , there is a global offset compared to theory , with the measured @xmath0 being about 2 or 3 times smaller than predicted .",
    "furthermore , the low temperature @xmath0 versus @xmath36 trend extrapolates to zero at a density of about @xmath37 , apparently suggesting the appearance of a ferromagnetic state , whereas no ferromagnetic state has ever been observed in gaas at these densities in much cleaner samples , even at mk temperature ( see e.g. ref .  [ ] ) .",
    "from a theoretical point of view , this transition is also expected for much lower densities ( higher @xmath12 parameter ) ( see e.g. refs .  [ ] ) .",
    "we believe that claims of a finite density ferromagnetic instability based only on the extrapolation of the @xmath38 curves to zero magnetic field are misleading .",
    "we argue that the physics that can account for these observations lies in the influence of disorder which has so far been neglected .",
    "the influence of disorder on the spin polarization has already been discussed for si mosfet s .",
    "@xcite in ref .",
    "[ ] , the field at which the magnetoresistance saturates was found to be sample dependent , increasing with the sample mobility .",
    "it was subsequently argued that the magneto resistance saturation actually reflects complete spin polarization of the _ non - localized _ carriers only , @xcite so that the value of @xmath0 is very sensitive to the number of localised states in the system . at zero perpendicular magnetic field ,",
    "a `` 2-component model '' , where a certain fraction of the electron are considered `` bound '' to impurities ( i.e. localized ) , was introduced in ref .",
    "[ ] in the context of the 2d metal - to- insulator transition ( mit ) , giving good agreement with experimental results .",
    "in our disordered gaas 2-deg , in which a significant fraction of electrons are localized , the fermi sea which the magnetic field `` has to polarize '' is then effectively smaller , resulting in an experimental @xmath0 smaller than the one predicted by theories neglecting localization .",
    "additionally , as the density is reduced from @xmath39 to @xmath40 the electron mobility in our sample drops by a factor of nearly 3 ( see table [ tab : table1 ] ) .",
    "the associated decrease of the conductivity @xmath41 at t@xmath42k as a function of the electron density can be well described using the percolation model for the apparent mit ( see e.g.@xcite ) , where @xmath43 , with @xmath44 the conductivity exponent and @xmath45 the critical density for the mit . using @xmath45 as the only adjustable parameter , one finds @xmath46 , we quote here is only an approximation of the zero temperature value not taking into account the temperature dependence of the conductivity exponent , p. ] which suggests that in this density region a significant proportion of the electronic states become localized , consistent with @xmath0 falling to zero in this region .",
    "we believe these disorder effects are not observed in the data of refs .",
    "[ ] because of the much higher mobility ( at least an order of magnitude ) of the sample investigated therein . in the latter work ,",
    "the experimental data and the theoretical predictions merge as density is lowered ( see tutuc et al .",
    "data in fig.[fig2](b ) ) .",
    "it has been suggested that this behavior can be understood by taking into account the effective mass increase due to the orbital coupling to the parallel field in a 2-deg with finite thickness .",
    "the increased effective mass leads to a smaller fermi energy and thus a reduction of @xmath0 .",
    "in such a picture the deviation from the theory for an ideal 2-deg is more pronounced at high electron density where the parallel magnetic fields involved are larger .",
    "such a behavior is not observed in our data , in which the discrepancies between theory and experiment only weakly depend on density and are actually slightly more pronounced at lower densities .",
    "this confirms that in our case the @xmath0 reduction is a disorder - induced phenomenon rather than a finite thickness effect , the latter being most likely overwhelmed by the dramatic effect of electron localization ( weaker in refs .",
    "the effect of temperature on the magnetoresistance is shown for a density of @xmath47 in the inset of fig.[fig1 ] , where a strong increase of @xmath0 is observed between 1.17  k and 4.2  k. the evolution of @xmath0 with respect to its value at @xmath19  k , is plotted as a function of temperature in fig.[fig2](b ) . as can be seen , in this temperature region , @xmath0 follows a sub - linear variation with t , the initial fast increase progressively slowing down at higher temperature .",
    "this trend differs from the temperature dependence of @xmath0 in the very low temperature regime recently observed for a 2d hole gas .@xcite the initial enhancement of @xmath0 becomes more and more pronounced as the density is decreased in the range @xmath48\\times 10^{10 } cm^{-2}$ ] ( only 3 densities are shown in fig.[fig2](b ) for clarity ) .",
    "the primary influence of temperature at a given magnetic field is to reduce the electron spin polarization . in a very simple single electron picture , the spin polarization @xmath49 of the 2d fermi sea in a parallel magnetic field",
    "is given by    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the fermi distribution function , @xmath52 is a heaviside step function , @xmath53 the spin gap separating the spin up and down subbands , @xmath54 the electron effective mass , and @xmath29 the magnetic field and temperature - dependent fermi energy .",
    "one expects the magnetic field @xmath0 , corresponding to @xmath55 , to increase with temperature to compensate for the polarization reduction induced by the smearing of the fermi distribution at the fermi level .",
    "calculations of @xmath56 normalized with respect to its value at @xmath31  k obtained using this formalism are shown by the dotted lines in fig.[fig2](b ) , for different electron densities . at higher electron density ,",
    "the fermi sea is more robust with respect to temperature so that the @xmath0 enhancement is less important , in qualitative agreement with our experimental results .",
    "@xcite intriguingly , the quantitative temperature dependence corresponds more to the expected dependence for low density systems ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "we take this as evidence that only a fraction of the total electron density contributes to the effective `` delocalized '' fermi sea responsible for the thermal effects , reinforcing our `` disorder - based '' interpretation of the reduced @xmath0 values . comparing the experimental and theoretical low temperature dependence",
    ", we can estimate the number of _ delocalized _ states in our system .",
    "for instance , for @xmath58 ( solid squares in fig.[fig2](b ) ) , the electron density that best reproduces the low temperature trend using our model is @xmath59 .",
    "this suggests that only @xmath60 of the electrons are delocalized at this density . for a total density of @xmath61 ( hexagons in fig.[fig2](b ) )",
    "our model yields a density of only @xmath62 , meaning @xmath63 of the states have become localized , consistent with the proximity of the mit in this density region .",
    "@xcite we can use the estimated density of _ delocalized _ electrons as a function of @xmath9 and re - plot the experimental @xmath0 at 1.17k as a function of these values ( diamonds in fig.[fig2].a ) , which gives a better quantitative agreement with theory .",
    "we stress that , unlike the original data set ( open circles ) , this corrected data set does not extrapolate to @xmath0=0 for a non zero carrier density ( not shown ) .",
    "there is therefore no evidence of a ferromagnetic transition once localization is taken into account .       in the high parallel field regime at @xmath22 , for different densities @xmath9 in @xmath64 ( symbols ) .",
    "@xmath6 ( dashed lines ) and qualitative trend combining spin and orbital effects ( solid lines ) ( see text ) . ]",
    "we now turn to the description of the `` frozen - spin '' regime where the system is fully polarized .",
    "as can be seen in fig.[fig1 ] , for @xmath65 , the resistance increases slowly before rising abruptly as the magnetic field is further increased .",
    "we stress that in this case , as the spin degree of freedom is frozen , the physical origin of this phenomenon can not be spin related . in fig.[fig3 ] we focus on the high field behavior of the resistance by plotting the resistivity @xmath5 on a log scale .",
    "in the high field limit , the resistivity asymptotically follows an exponential power law , @xmath66 , where @xmath67 increases monotonically as the density is reduced ( dashed lines in fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "the observed power law is qualitatively consistent with an increased intersubband scattering due to the orbital coupling to the parallel field , for which an identical magnetic field dependance , @xmath6 , is expected .",
    "@xcite the orbital coupling to the in - plane magnetic field can be thought of as a parallel field induced effective 2d to 3d crossover in our low density quasi-2d system .",
    "the fact that the coefficient @xmath67 increases at low density is consistent with this effect being stronger as the system becomes more dilute .@xcite one can combine these orbital effects with the initial @xmath20 `` spin trend '' to try to reproduce the general behavior of the resistance . for this",
    "we use the following expression for @xmath5 , @xmath68 , where the second and third term corresponds to spin and orbital contributions to the resistance respectively .",
    "the `` spin term '' is set to @xmath69 for @xmath65 to account for the quench of spin effects , and @xmath70 increases with decreasing density , consistent with spin polarization growing faster at lower electron density .",
    "the `` orbital term '' is determined from the high field limit , with @xmath71 ( independent of density ) and @xmath72 for our density range .",
    "the obtained behaviour is plotted as solid lines in fig.[fig3 ] and reproduces the experimental data very well leading further support to our simple model .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the physics of gaas 2d electron systems under a strong parallel magnetic field is at low electron density determined by an _ interplay _ between spin , localization and orbital effects .",
    "the magnetic field at which complete spin polarization occurs is dramatically reduced both by electron localization and electron - electron interaction enhanced at low carrier density .",
    "the large value of the extrapolated carrier density for full spin polarization at zero magnetic field simply reflects the large number of localized electrons present in disordered systems and should under no circumstances be interpreted as evidence for a ferromagnetic instability ."
