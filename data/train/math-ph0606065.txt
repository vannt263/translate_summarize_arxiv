    "in a recent paper , werner  @xcite has shown there exists a measure on simple loops on any riemann surface which has the property of conformal restriction .",
    "this is to say that if @xmath4 are any two subdomains of the manifold , the measures on loops in @xmath5 obtained by ( a ) restriction of the measure on loops in @xmath6 to those in @xmath5 , and ( b ) conformally mapping @xmath7 , are the same .",
    "moreover this measure is unique up to multiplication by a constant .",
    "we refer to these loops throughout the paper as self - avoiding loops and to the mass of any subset under werner s measure as the @xmath8-mass .",
    "one may also consider the set of self - avoiding polygons on some regular lattice embedded in the manifold .",
    "the total number of such polygons of length @xmath9 is known to grow as @xmath10 where @xmath8 is lattice dependent .",
    "the measure which weights each polygon with a factor @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 ) has the restriction property , and is commonly conjectured also to be conformally invariant in the limit of vanishing lattice spacing , which means that it should give a particular example of werner s measure . in this paper",
    "we assume this to be true , and hence conjecture values of the @xmath8-mass of certain loop subsets , using ( non - rigorous ) coulomb gas and cft methods applied to a generalised model , the o@xmath13 model .",
    "the o(@xmath0 ) model encompasses a large group of physically interesting models , including the ising spin model , the percolation problem and self - avoiding loops .",
    "the theory may be written as a spin model with nearest neighbour interactions , or alternatively in the loop gas picture , in which the states of the model are non - intersecting loops constructed on the edges of the spin model .",
    "each loop is weighted with a factor @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is related to the reduced coupling in the model and @xmath9 is the length of the loop . in the ising model , these loops are the cluster boundaries of a spin model defined on the dual lattice . at the critical point of the model , @xmath16 ,",
    "it is conjectured to flow under the renormalization group to a gaussian free field  @xcite , which is a well known example of a conformal field theory ( cft ) .",
    "one of us  @xcite showed the existence of operators in this theory whose two point correlation functions count loops around one of two points with a weight @xmath17 rather than @xmath0 , hence giving information about the distribution of loops .",
    "the choice @xmath18 is of particular interest ; these operators are then called twist operators and are at @xmath19 in the kac classification  @xcite .",
    "hence , they have null states at level two .",
    "the two point correlation function is then equivalent to the expectation value of @xmath20 in the loop ensemble , where @xmath21 is the number of intersections of loops with a defect line , a continuous curve connecting the two points .",

    ", we may think of each operator as again being a source ( or sink ) of a defect line .",
    "hence there is a defect line running between each pair of points .",
    "we argue that the choice of paths for the defect lines is unimportant and that they may run between any two distinct pairs of points . the four point correlation function",
    "can then be shown to be the expectation value of @xmath20 where @xmath21 is now the total number of crossings of loops with defect lines .",
    "particular semi - connected parts of this four point function yield the expected numbers of weighted loops ( the @xmath8-mass of loops ) which wind around two of the four locations of the operators , as in figure  [ figintrofourpoints ] .",
    "cft may be used to derive the form of the four point function , since the null states of the operators imply that the correlation functions obey a set of belavin , polyakov and zamalodchikov ( bpz ) type partial differential equations  @xcite .",
    "we solve these equations and hence find analytic expressions for the @xmath8-mass of loops which separate one pair of points from the other . for loops which separate @xmath24 from @xmath25 , for example",
    ", we obtain the expression    @xmath26 is the cross - ratio of the points .",
    "these expected numbers of weighted loops are finite in the continuum limit because there is no contribution from vanishingly small loops , and are invariant under conformal transformations .",
    "we show that the non - leading behaviour of these expressions as @xmath27 reveals the derivative of the central charge with respect to @xmath0 at @xmath28 .",
    "this is consistent with the interpretation @xcite of the stress tensor as the spin - two component of the relative probability that a loop passes between two points in the limit @xmath29 .",
    "we use similar arguments for the o(@xmath0 ) model in a simply connected domain .",
    "such a domain may always be mapped via a conformal transformation to the upper half plane with the real axis as the boundary . the two point function in this domain satisfies the same partial differential equations as the four point function in the bulk , with the locations of the two operators and the reflections of these points in the real axis being the locations of the four operators in the bulk theory .",
    "we show that the connected two point function of twist operators in the @xmath22 limit counts the mass of loops around the locations of both operators , and find the explicit expression    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is now the cross ratio of the two points together with their conformal images in the boundary .     to the power of their length .",

    "we recall the arguments leading to the coulomb gas picture of the o(@xmath0 ) model . in section  [ sectwistoperators ]",
    "we discuss twist operators in the o(@xmath0 ) model and derive the form of the two point correlation function of these operators .",
    "the small @xmath0 limit of the theory is explored and the correlation function in this limit is shown to depend ( to order @xmath23 ) only on the configurations of a single loop . in section  [ sec4ptfncft ]",
    "we discuss the four point correlation function of twist operators . because the twist operators have null states at level two , this correlation function satisfies a set of partial differential equations , which we solve analytically .",
    "the interpretation of the four point function in terms of a pair of defect lines is explained , followed by the example of the four point function of twist operators as the four point function of spin operators in the ising model",
    ". section  [ sec4ptinterpretation ] is devoted to the small @xmath0 limit of the four point function and contains a derivation of the mass of loops winding around two of the four points .",
    "we then explain how these numbers , as functions of the positions of the four points , hold a key to measuring the effective central charge of the o(@xmath0 ) model as @xmath22 . in section  [ sec2ptbcft ]",
    "we apply the theory of twist operators to the o(@xmath0 ) model in a simply connected domain and show that the mass of loops around two points in such a domain is invariant under conformal transformations and finite in the limit of vanishing lattice spacing .",
    "finally , in section  [ secstochasticprocess ] we show that the mass of loops around two of four points on the riemann sphere can be thought of in terms of an sle@xmath32 process .",
    "let us start with the following partition function for the o(@xmath0 ) model @xcite : @xmath33 the @xmath34 are @xmath0-component spins on a lattice @xmath35 and the product is over pairs of nearest neighbours .",
    "the product in the partition function can be expanded into a sum of @xmath36 terms , where @xmath21 is the number of nearest neighbours .",
    "each term can be represented by a graph of open and closed loops in the following way : the neighbouring sites , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , are joined together by a line if the @xmath39 term was chosen in the expansion of equation  ( [ eqzon ] ) , or left disconnected if the number @xmath40 was chosen instead .",
    "the trace over spins may then be done for each graph individually . since @xmath41 because of the symmetry under the transformation @xmath42 , all graphs containing an odd number of @xmath34 make no contribution to the partition function .",
    "these are the graphs with open loops , hence the partition function will only contain contributions from graphs with closed loops .",
    "let us consider the honeycomb lattice for simplicity , then there may be 0,1,2 or 3 powers of a given @xmath34 .",
    "the trace over spins of @xmath43 will contribute a factor of 1 , whereas , from @xmath44 , instances of @xmath45 lead to a factor of @xmath0 for each closed loop in the graph .",
    "the partition function is therefore equivalent to @xmath46 where @xmath9 is the total length of all the loops in a given graph , @xmath47 is the number of closed loops and the trace is now over all graphs of closed , non - intersecting loops .",
    "this form of the partition function may be used for general values of @xmath0 , whereas equation  ( [ eqzon ] ) is applicable only to positive , integer @xmath0 .",
    "there exists a critical point in the theory , at @xmath48 , where the mean loop length diverges and the model is supposed to become conformally invariant . in order to formulate a field theory , the non - local factors of @xmath0 must be made local .",
    "this can be done by assigning orientations to the loops ( either clockwise or anticlockwise ) and inserting local factors of @xmath49 at each vertex where the curve turns to the right and @xmath50 where the curve turns to the left .",
    "summing over the two possible orientations for each loop leads to a contribution of @xmath51 from each closed loop on the honeycomb lattice , where closed loops have a difference in the number of left and right turns of six with the sign depending on the orientation of the loop . in order to obtain the desired factor of @xmath0 for each closed loop , @xmath52",
    "must therefore be chosen such that @xmath53 this may now be transformed into a height model .",
    "the height variables are taken to be integer multiples of @xmath54 and are assigned to sites on the dual lattice , such that the loops are contours of the landscape . crossing a loop running from left to right leads to a decrease in the height of @xmath54 , whilst crossing a loop running from right to left leads to an increase in the height of @xmath54 .",
    "a given configuration of the heights corresponds to a unique graph of orientated loops .",
    "the assumption of the coulomb gas is that this height model flows under the renormalisation group ( rg ) into a free field theory with action @xmath55=\\frac{g}{4\\pi}\\int{(\\partial h(\\textbf{r}))^2 d^{2}\\textbf{r}}\\,,\\ ] ] for some @xmath56 .",
    "there is an additional subtlety regarding topology , which may be seen by considering the model defined on the cylinder . on a cylinder of circumference",
    "@xmath57 , the loops wrapping around the circumference are counted incorrectly ( for  @xmath58 ) .",
    "loops wrapping around have the same number of left turns as right turns .",
    "these loops are therefore not counted correctly . the situation is remedied by placing a vertex operator ( also known as an electric charge ) @xmath59 at one end of the cylinder and an operator @xmath60 at the other end .",
    "let these points be @xmath61 .",
    "if there is a single loop wrapping around the cylinder , then there will be a height difference of @xmath54 between the ends , the sign of which depends on the orientation of the loop .",
    "summing over the two possibilities for the orientation then leads to the required contribution of @xmath62 .",
    "these charges at the ends of the cylinder lead to a modification of the partition function to @xmath63 where the abbreviation ffc signifies that the above expectation values and partition functions are for the free field theory on the cylinder and where we have used @xmath64 .",
    "the free energy per unit length on the cylinder for this coulomb gas ( cg ) partition function may be calculated as @xmath65 this is the form of the free energy on the cylinder obtained via the schwartzian derivative from a theory on the plane with central charge @xmath66  @xcite given by @xmath67 where the first term comes from the known behaviour of @xmath68  @xcite .",
    "all that remains is to fix the value of @xmath69 , which may be obtained from the following argument : adding a term @xmath70 to the action should not affect the critical behaviour , since the height variables were defined to be integer multiples of @xmath54 and @xmath71 for all integer @xmath72 .",
    "hence , this term should be marginal under renormalisation group flow and therefore must have scaling dimension  @xmath73 .",
    "this determines  @xcite @xmath74",
    "in the loop ( coulomb ) gas picture of the @xmath75 model , loops wrapping around the cylinder may be counted with a weight @xmath17 different from @xmath0 by placing additional charges @xmath76 at the ends of the cylinder , with @xmath77 chosen according to equation  ( [ eqchin ] ) .",
    "the scaling dimension of these operators may be obtained from their two point correlation function in the loop gas ensemble . placing the charges at @xmath78 , @xmath79 these free field expectation values",

    "their correlation functions may be considered in geometries other than the cylinder .",
    "for example , on the riemann sphere , the two point function of such operators is fixed by scale invariance to be @xmath87 where we have inserted explicit factors of the lattice spacing , @xmath88 , so as to make @xmath89 dimensionless . the two point correlation function in the loop gas",
    "may also be calculated on the sphere using the ensemble of equation  ( [ eqlooppartition ] ) .",
    "each loop separating the points @xmath90 and @xmath91 will be counted with weight @xmath92 rather than @xmath0 , hence graphs in @xmath93 will be weighted with an additional factor of @xmath94 to the power of the number of loops separating the two points .",

    "the choice of a chordal sle reflected in @xmath257 is clearly arbitrary ; other choices correspond to taking different linear combinations of the holomorphic and anti - holomorphic equations . perhaps using radial or whole - plane sle would make the formula look more symmetrical .",

    "the partition function and correlation functions are dependent to first order in  @xmath0 only on the configurations of a single loop .",
    "hence , by equating particular semi - connected parts of the four point function calculated using conformal field theory to the result from the coulomb gas picture , we have deduced the expected number of weighted loops winding around two of the four points and shown that this number is invariant under conformal transformations .",
    "this is presumably the mass of such a subset under the measure on loops introduced by werner .",
    "other configurations of loops receive contributions from vanishingly small loops around a single point and are not finite in the limit of vanishing lattice spacing .",
