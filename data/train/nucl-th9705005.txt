    "in the investigation of superfluidity or superconductivity phenomena in systems of strongly interacting fermions a crucial role is played by the gap equation of the bcs theory @xcite . for infinite homogeneous systems",
    "the kernel of the gap equation is usually a slowly decreasing function of the quasiparticle momentum .",
    "even if the sum over momenta converges , contributions from terms involving large momentum components of the interaction and quasiparticle energies very far from the fermi surface , are not negligible @xcite , despite the fact that the gap energy may result to be a small fraction of the fermi energy .",
    "contrary to what happens for electrons in metals , for nuclear or neutron matter , there is no natural cutoff over momentum .",
    "consequently for nuclear matter a relativistic treatment is desireable . in the present work",
    "we investigate pairing correlations in cold symmetric nuclear matter by taking into account relativistic effects in a consistent way . a first study in this direction , for @xmath3 pairing in nuclear matter ,",
    "has been already performed by h. kucharek and p. ring @xcite within the framework of the quantum hadrodynamics theory of ref.@xcite (  qhd  ) .",
    "these authors , though introducing some simplifying assumptions (  e.g exchange terms of the interaction have been neglected  ) , have shown that pairing correlations and partcle  hole correlations can be described on the same foot within a relativistic treatment . in our opinion the consequences of a relativistic quantum approach have not been thoroughly exploited in ref.@xcite .",
    "for instance , the amplitudes of the nucleon field in the quasiparticle states have been assumed to be proportional simply to the four  spinors of the hartree approximation .    in a recent paper @xcite a more complete relativistic treatment of the hartree",
    "bogoliubov approximation to qhd has been presented .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have shown that the pairing field has large scalar and vector components .",
    "the actual value of the gap in the excitation spectrum is the result of a strong mutual cancellation between these components of the pairing field . in the present work",
    "we obtain similar results , in particular the expression for the quasiparticle energy practically coincides with that of ref .  @xcite .",
    "however , though the starting point of our treatment is the same as in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. a relativistic generalization of the gorkov scheme @xcite , we do not need to introduce any particular `` ansatz '' for an effective single ",
    "particle lagrangian , as done in ref .",
    "moreover , we show that a more consistent treatment , from a relativistic point of view , brings out a new interesting feature : the pair amplitude vanishes beyond a certain momentum of the paired nucleons .",
    "the value of this momentum depends on the nuclear density and on the strength of the self  consistent pairing field . as a consequence in the relativistic gap equation",
    "a natural cutoff over momentum occurs . in the previous works of refs .",
    "@xcite it has been necessary to introduce such a cutoff in an arbitrary way , in order to obtain a satisfactory agreement with the current estimates of nonrelativistic calculations @xcite for the energy gap .",

    "i  ) @xcite , we include also the charged @xmath2 meson field in a phenomenological way similar to the  mft   approach to  qhd  ii   of ref .  @xcite . for simplicity",

    "first we perform our calculations by using the same approximations already introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite for studying collective modes and response functions of nuclear matter . these approximations amount to neglecting finite  range and retardation effects in the exchange of mesons between nucleons . within this approach",
    "we obtain simple expressions for the relevant quantities , where we can easily appreciate the role played by the various ingredients of the theory . in spite of the approximations introduced , the essential features of a relativistically covariant treatment are retained .",
    "the value of the energy gap obtained with the approach just mentioned is much larger than the value predicted by nonrelativistic treatments @xcite .",
    "a better quantitative agreement can be achieved by taking into account the finite range of the nucleon ",
    "nucleon interaction .",
    "retardation effects instead do not play a significant role .",
    "we evaluate the finite  range effects by using an iterative procedure and show that the first iteration gives already a sufficiently accurate approximation .",

    "therefore we add to the lagrangian the term @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the chemical potential (  @xmath6 denotes the 8component nucleon field  ) . in the end the value of the chemical potential will be determined by fixing the average baryon density . with these ingredients the field equations are @xcite    [ all2.1 ] @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10    where @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",

    "[ f:8 ] the components of the pair amplitude are shown as functions of @xmath151 for @xmath193 . the finite  range corrections makes the pair amplitude even more peaked about @xmath155 .",
    "this fact further justifies the approximation expressed by eqs .",
    "( [ 4.4 ] ) and ( [ 4.5 ] ) . that approximation simplifies calculations substantially .",
    "in fact , the basic quantities , i.e. the components of the pairing field , that are determined self  consistently , are still two constants . we have assessed the reliability of this approximation by successive iterations of eqs .",
    "( [ 4.2 ] ) and ( [ 4.3 ] ) , starting from eqs .",
    "( [ 4.4 ] ) and ( [ 4.5 ] ) .",
    "the correction coming from the first iteration amounts to a few percent , while the second iteration does not substantially modify the first  order results .",
    "we have evaluated also the order of magnitude of retardation effects , replacing @xmath86 and @xmath195 instead of @xmath82 and @xmath196 in eqs .",
    "( [ 4.2 ] ) and ( [ 4.3 ] ) .",
    "the change is less than one percent .",
    "we have investigated in the framework of a relativistic model , the possibility for the onset of a superfluid phase in symmetric nuclear matter and the features of this phase .",
    "we have derived equations for the relevant quantities of the superfluid phase by making a relativistic generalization of the scheme introduced by gorkov to study superconductivity in electron systems . in this scheme nuclear matter",
    "is described as an ensemble of quasiparticles moving in the hartree ",
    "fock field plus a self  consistent paring field . at first both the hartree  fock field and the pairing field have been treated on the same foot by using an approximation where the finite range and the retardation of the meson propagation between nucleons have been neglected .",
    "then , we have improved our approach by introducing finite  range effects for the quantities pertaining to the superfluid phase .    in the relativistic treatment of the pairing process for a system at rest",
    "the pairing field has two different components : a lorentz scalar @xmath128 and the time ",
    "component @xmath129 of a four  vector .",
    "the different behaviour of the two components under lorentz transformations must be properly taken into account in the relativistic hydrodynamics of nuclear systems in the superfluid phase .    in the non relativistic limit @xmath128 and @xmath129",
    "coincide . in our approach",
    "they are slightly different .",
    "this does not mean , however , that relativistic effects are negligible .",
    "actually , the expression for the quasiparticle energy derived in our calculations , differs from the nonrelativistic expression of the bcs theory in an essential way . the quasiparticle energy given by eq .",
    "( [ 2.25 ] ) or by its analogous expression that includes finite  range corrections , displays the salient feature that it can be less than @xmath197 beyond a certain value of @xmath151 .",
    "this determines the occurence of a cutoff in the relativistic gap equations ( [ 2.34c ] ) and ( [ 2.34d ] ) , that does not appear in the analogous nonrelativistic expression .",
    "this cutoff removes the contributions of high @xmath151 components of the interaction to the gap equation , thus allowing the use of nucleon  nucleon interactions that are only slowly decreasing for high values of @xmath151 .",
    "this fact reduces the energy gap appreciably .",
