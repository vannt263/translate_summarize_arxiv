    "is confined between two narrowly spaced glass plates ( a hele - shaw cell ) .",
    "there are also other types of quasi-2d systems , such as the bragg raft @xcite , where a single layer of bubbles floats on a liquid pool , and the confined bubble raft , where a bragg raft is trapped underneath a glass plate .",
    "the most important distinction between these experimental realisations is concerned with the presence of viscous drag .",
    "when a foam is in contact with one or two confining plates , there is a drag force associated with any movement of the foam relative to the plate(s ) . as we shall see , the drag force in the vf model ( see eq .",

    "such non - exponential velocity profiles , together with their velocity dependence can be obtained from an extension or generalisation of the original continuum model @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these experiments show that the localisation length decreases as the velocity of the moving boundary increases . in this paper , we show velocity profiles from our vf simulations which exhibit qualitatively similar behaviour .    of particular current interest in these types of experiments",

    "recent results by wyn @xcite suggest that as the second moment of the bubble area distribution @xmath13 is increased in such simulations to values approaching 0.2 or higher , shear - banding can occur in regions away from the moving boundary .",

    "there is therefore no relevant time scale present and so no concept of shear - rate .",

    "such a model must include a constitutive relation which relates the local ( wall ) drag force of the vf model to an averaged drag force in the continuum description .",
