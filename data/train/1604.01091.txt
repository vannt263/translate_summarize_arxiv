    "reallocation of resources to achieve mutually better outcomes is a central concern in multi - agent settings .",
    "a desirable way to achieve ` better ' outcomes is to obtain a pareto improvement in which each agent is at least as happy and at least one agent is strictly happier  @xcite .",
    "pareto improvements are desirable for two fundamental reasons : they result in strictly more welfare for any reasonable notion of welfare ( such as utilitarian or leximin ) .",
    "secondly , they satisfy the minimal requirement of individual rationality in the sense that no agent is worse off after the trade . if a series of pareto improvements results in a pareto optimal outcome , that is even better because there exists no other outcome which each agent weakly prefers and at least one agent strictly prefers .",
    "we consider the setting in which agents are initially endowed with objects and they also have additive preferences for the objects . in the absence of endowments , achieving a pareto optimal assignment is easy : simply assign every object to the agent who values it the most . on the other hand , in the presence of endowments , finding a pareto optimal assignment that respects individual rationality is more challenging . the problem is closely related to the problem of testing pareto optimality of the initial assignment . a certificate of pareto dominance gives an assignment that respects individual rationality and is a pareto improvement . in fact , if testing pareto optimality is np - hard , then finding an individually rational and pareto optimal assignment is np - hard as well . in view of this , we focus on the problem of testing pareto optimality . in all cases where we are able to test it efficiently , we also present algorithms to compute individually rational and pareto optimal assignments .",

    "we then identify some natural tractable cases .",
    "in particular , we present a pseudo - polynomial - time algorithm for the problem when the number of agents is constant .",
    "we characterize pareto optimality under lexicographic utilities ( i.e. , lexicographic preferences ) and we show that pareto optimality can be tested in linear time . for dichotomous preferences in which utilities can take values @xmath0 or @xmath1 , we present a characterization of pareto optimal assignments which also yields a polynomial - time algorithm to test pareto optimality .",
    "in the ordinal setting , we consider two versions of pareto optimality : _ possible pareto optimality _ and _ necessary pareto optimality_. for both properties , we present characterizations that lead to polynomial - time algorithms for testing the property for a given assignment .

    "for @xmath17 , @xmath239 .",

    "[ thm : char_nec_po ] an assignment @xmath39 is necessarily pareto optimal iff    1 .   it is possibly pareto optimal and 2 .   it does not admit a one - for - two pareto improvement swap .    we first show that if an assignment does not satisfy the two conditions , then it is not necessarily pareto optimal .",
    "possible pareto optimality is a requirement for the assignment to be necessarily pareto optimal . to see that the second condition is also necessary , we have to show that if @xmath39 admits a one - for - two pareto improvement swap then @xmath39 is not necessarily pareto optimal",
    "this is because the swap could indeed be a pareto improvement for these two agents with the following utilities : @xmath246 and @xmath247 .",
    "these utilities are compatible with the ordinal preferences of these agents , because of the assumption @xmath245 ( and irrespective to the ordinal preferences of @xmath241 ) .",

    "we may assume that each agent receives a nonempty bundle in @xmath39 .",
    "regarding * the structure * of @xmath39 , first we observe that the lack of one - for - two pareto improvement swaps implies that every agent is assigned to some ( or none ) of her top objects and possibly to one additional object that she ranks lower .",

    "@xmath288 implies @xmath293 , leading to the conclusion that @xmath5 must be indifferent between all objects in @xmath289 .",
    "therefore @xmath277 can map @xmath83 to @xmath252 in @xmath277 and @xmath292 to @xmath294 .",

    "we terminate the sequence when an object is first repeated .",
    "this repetition must occur at some agent in @xmath295 , since for any agent @xmath5 the objects in @xmath284 are in a one - to - one correspondence with those in @xmath283 with @xmath277 .",

    "she receives object @xmath326 and in return she gives away @xmath327 , where @xmath328 by the definition of @xmath295 .",
    "since @xmath5 appears in this sequence only once , it is obvious that @xmath329 .",
    "finally , regarding @xmath330 , @xmath5 receives @xmath331 and she gives away @xmath332 , where @xmath333 .",
    "so we constructed a pareto improvement sequence , and therefore @xmath39 is not possibly pareto optimal , a contradiction .",
    "in example  [ example - npo ] , @xmath39 is not necessarily pareto optimal because it admits a one - for - two pareto improvement swap : @xmath98 , @xmath334 , @xmath335 and @xmath336 .",
    "it also shows that although an assignment may not be necessarily pareto optimal there may not be any assignment that pareto dominates it for _ all _ utilities consistent with the ordinal preferences .",
    "the characterization above also gives us a polynomial - time algorithm to test necessary pareto optimality .",
    "we have studied , from a computational point of view , pareto optimality in resource allocation under additive utilities and ordinal preferences .",

    "this implies that those objects can not be assigned to agent @xmath380 , with @xmath363 , in order to ensure that they get a utility at least @xmath397 .",
    "therefore every agent @xmath380 should receive the object @xmath398 with utility @xmath399 .",
    "furthermore no agent @xmath380 can receive an object @xmath400 to complete her bundle of two objects because this object would provide her a utility at most @xmath401 .",
    "so , every agent @xmath380 should receive the object @xmath402 . from this , we conclude that @xmath39 should be exactly the same assignment as the initial assignment , which contradicts @xmath39 pareto - dominates this initial assignment .    from the previous paragraphs ,",
    "we know that any good of @xmath392 should be assigned in @xmath39 to the agent pointed by the corresponding dotted arrow in figure [ figcycleproof ] .",
    "to achieve a utility at least 4 , any agent @xmath371 should receive the good @xmath402 to complete her bundle of two objects .",
    "if an agent @xmath380 did not receive at least one good @xmath400 such that @xmath403 , then the maximal utility achievable by @xmath380 would be @xmath404 , which would be strictly lower than her utility in the initial assignment .",
    "so , every agent @xmath380 should receive exactly one good @xmath400 such that @xmath403 .",
    "therefore no good @xmath387 can be assigned to agent @xmath376 .",
    "so , to achieve a utility at least 4 , any agent @xmath376 should receive the good @xmath398 to complete her bundle of two objects .",
    "then the good @xmath83 should be assigned to agent @xmath383 to complete her bundle of two goods .",
    "finally it remains to assign to every agent @xmath380 a good @xmath405 such that @xmath403 .",
    "now let us focus on the pair of goods assigned in @xmath39 to agent @xmath380 with @xmath363 .",
    "note that those two objects belong to @xmath406 .",
    "we know that the total amount of utility provided by the goods of @xmath406 to the agents of @xmath92 should be exactly equal to @xmath407 .",
    "furthermore any agent @xmath380 should receive a share of at least @xmath397 of this total amount of utility . since @xmath408 ,",
    "any agent @xmath380 should receive two objects @xmath405 and @xmath409 such that @xmath410 .",
    "let @xmath277 and @xmath342 be the two permutations of @xmath411 such that for any @xmath363 , the objects @xmath412 and @xmath413 are assigned in @xmath39 to agent @xmath380 .",
    "those two permutations are such that for any @xmath363 , @xmath344 .",
    "this leads to a contradiction with @xmath414 is a no - instance ."
