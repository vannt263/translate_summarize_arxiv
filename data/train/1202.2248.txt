    "the current standard cosmology model relies on the existence of two unknown dark components , the so called `` dark matter '' ( dm ) and `` dark energy '' ( de ) , which amount to @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the total energy budget in the universe , respectively . according to several observations ,",
    "the universe is spatially flat and in an accelerated phase of its expansion @xcite . de , described as a cosmological constant @xmath4 in its simplest form , is modelled by a fluid with a negative pressure , which is a fundamental ingredient to explain the actual accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain de @xcite .",
    "an alternative consists to consider a phenomenological variable de density with continuous creation / disruption of photons @xcite or matter @xcite .",
    "the de might decay / grow slowly in the course of the cosmic evolution and thus provide the source / sink term for matter and radiation .",
    "different such models have been discussed and strong constraints come from very accurate measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation and other typical cosmological probe .",
    "cmb radiation is the best evidence for an expanding universe starting from an initial high density state . within the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw )",
    "models of the universe the radiation , after decoupling , expands adiabatically and scales as @xmath5 , @xmath6 being the redshift @xcite .",
    "if we assume that each component is not conserved , contrarily to the standard scenario , then depending on the decay mechanism of the de , the created photons could lead to distortions in the planck spectrum of the cmb , and change the evolution of its temperature . the chance to appreciate the deviation from the standard temperature evolution",
    "is given by the increasingly number of recent works collecting observations of cmb temperature both at low @xcite and higher redshifts @xcite .",
    "following the theoretical lines of @xcite , in jetzer et al .",
    "@xcite we have discussed a variable de model @xmath7 decaying into photons and dm particles . in particular we studied thermodynamical aspects in the case of a continuous photon creation , which implies a modified temperature redshift relation for the cmb .",
    "we have tested the predicted temperature evolution of radiation with some recent data on the cmb at higher redshift from both sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect and high - redshift qso absorption lines as well as with an updated collection of data from different kind of observations , like distance moduli of supernovae ia , observations of the cmb anisotropy and the large - scale structure , together with observational hubble parameter estimations @xcite .",
    "a similar approach , however without considering photon creation and thus a modification in the cmb temperature evolution , has been discussed by ma @xcite .",
    "we assume a cosmological framework based on the usual robertson - walker ( rw ) metric element @xcite and that the universe contains three different components : a ) a matter ( both baryons and dm ) fluid , with equation of state @xmath8 ( since @xmath9 ) , b ) a generalised fluid with pressure @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a free parameter , which is set to @xmath12 for a properly said radiation fluid , and c ) a de , @xmath13 component , with pressure @xmath14 and density @xmath15 . the equation of state for the @xmath13 component could assume a very general expression , but we limit ourselves to consider the simple linear relation @xmath16 . we will set any bare cosmological constant @xmath17 equal to 0 @xcite . with these components we get for the einstein field equations @xcite    @xmath18    @xmath19    where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the total pressure and density",
    ", @xmath22 is the scale factor , @xmath23 is the curvature parameter and a dot means time derivative . furthermore , we will assume that there is no curvature , thus @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "in the following we will adopt @xmath25 , however since we are assuming that the vacuum decays into radiation and massive particles , the effective equation of state @xmath26 , which is the measured quantity , can differ from @xmath27 .",
    "following @xcite ( but see also @xcite ) we set here the energy conservation equation for the different fluids .",
    "the fluid as whole , verifies the bianchi identity , which means that energy and momentum are locally conserved : @xmath28 , with @xmath29 the stress - energy tensor @xmath30 and @xmath31 being the four velocity . after easy calculations , this conservation law reads @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the hubble parameter . in the standard approach ,",
    "each component is conserved , thus eq .",
    "( [ eq : cons_all ] ) holds for all the fluid components , but here we will suppose that each component will exchange energy with each other . in particular ,",
    "for matter , radiation and de we impose the following relations ( see also @xcite ) @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 where we assume that both the matter and the radiation fluids exchange energy with the de as parameterized by @xmath37 and @xmath38 . in particular ,",
    "@xmath37 depends on the de and , indeed , acts as a source / sink term for the fluids energy .",
    "evidently , if no interaction between the different components exists , then @xmath39 is null and the standard picture is recovered .",
    "moreover , if @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) , then the de exchanges all the energy with matter ( radiation ) .",
    "@xmath39 can describe different physical situations such as , for instance , a thermogravitational quantum creation theory @xcite or a quintessence scalar field cosmology @xcite . as we will discuss later on",
    ", @xmath38 has to be very small ( i.e. , @xmath42 ) , otherwise the radiation density would become much too big , contrary to present values . as an order of magnitude estimate we expect @xmath43 , for which indeed @xmath42 , since @xmath44 .    adopting as mentioned above the relation @xmath45 and defining @xmath46 , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : cons_x ] ) we obtain @xmath47 we assume a power law model for the @xmath48 function , @xmath49 , or equivalently in terms of redshift , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is a constant .",
    "the value of this constant is @xmath52 , which can be found using eq .",
    "( [ eq : fried_1 ] ) at the present epoch , assuming that today @xmath53 .",
    "thus , the density evolution for the @xmath13 component is given by @xmath54 where we have defined as @xmath55 the present critical density of the universe .",
    "if @xmath56 is positive , then the de slowly decreases as a function of the cosmic time , whereas if @xmath56 is negative the inverse process happens .    from eqs .",

    "( [ eq : rho_m ] ) the usual evolution @xmath61 holds , while the radiation besides the usual term @xmath62 has also a perturbative term depending on @xmath56 . since today @xcite , corresponding to @xmath63 . ] @xmath64 it turns out that @xmath56 has to be extremely small @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , unless @xmath56 is extremely small or vanishing , de has to decay mainly in matter with possibly some photons as well .",
    "thus the condition @xmath42 has to hold .",
    "due to the very small value of @xmath59 it follows that the evolution of the universe is essentially driven by the de and dm , therefore , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fried_1 ] ) the following law for the hubble parameter holds @xmath66^{1/2}~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is obviously the same expression found in ma @xcite .    recasting eq .",
    "( [ eq : cons_x ] ) , it is possible to write @xmath67 which shows that the term @xmath39 contributes to an effective pressure @xmath68 therefore , we get an equivalent effective de equation of state @xmath69 @xcite @xmath70 if @xmath71 then we have @xmath72 , i.e. our model is quintessence - like @xcite , while we have a phantom - like @xcite model when @xmath56 is negative and @xmath73 .",
    "another interesting quantity is the deceleration parameter , which can be written as @xmath74 imposing that @xmath75 , we can determine the _ transition redshift _ , i.e. the redshift at which the universe changed from a deceleration to an acceleration phase , which is given by @xmath76 from this result we see that the larger @xmath56 is , the earlier the universe changes from deceleration to acceleration .",
    "we follow here the approach outlined in lima @xcite , where he defines a current as @xmath77 with @xmath78 being the particle number density of the photons or of the dm particles . indeed",
    ", there is a current for each of these components . due to the decaying vacuum",
    "the current satisfies the following balance equation ( one for each component ) @xmath79 with @xmath80 or @xmath81 ( @xmath11 for the photons and @xmath81 for the dark matter ) and @xmath82 is the corresponding particle source . for decaying vacuum models",
    "@xmath83 is positive and related to the rate of change of @xmath15 .",
    "we can also define an entropy current of the form @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the specific entropy per particle ( photons , dm and in principle also de ) .",
    "if the de @xmath15 is constant the above entropy current is conserved .",
    "the existence of a non equilibrium decay process of the vacuum implies @xmath86 , thus an increase of the entropy as a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics . in principle the second law should be applied to the system as a whole , thus including the vacuum component @xcite . assuming that the vacuum is like a condensate with zero chemical potential @xmath87 it follows from euler s relation @xmath88 provided @xmath25 , that @xmath89 and thus its contribution to the entropy current vanishes .",
    "given our assumptions the vacuum plays the role of a condensate carrying no entropy .",
    "for instance , for quintessence models in the limit where the scalar field does not depend on time , and thus its time derivative vanishes , one gets @xmath25 . in the later stages of the universe",
    "the time dependence is possibly very weak so that @xmath25 holds up to small corrections .",
    "the equation for the particle number density of radiation component is given by eq .",

    "to carry out the integration of the first term on the right hand side it is useful to perform a change of variable from @xmath107 to @xmath6 and accordingly @xmath108 . this way we get ( with @xmath109 corresponding to the time @xmath103 and @xmath110 corresponding to @xmath102 present time ) @xmath111 where @xmath112 denotes derivative with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "as next we insert @xmath113 and its derivative as taken from eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) into eq .",

    "( [ eq : t_fin_2 ] ) the explicit form of @xmath51 , thus getting as exponent in the above eq . @xmath118 .",
    "hereafter , we will set @xmath119 .",
    "clearly @xmath98 and @xmath56 are not independent , we checked using the temperature redshift data that if @xmath98 is bigger ( @xmath120 or more ) , then @xmath56 has to be extremely small consistently with what mentioned above ( as it would lead to a too high production of photons in the de decay ) .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath98 gets smaller ( e.g. , @xmath121 @xmath56 gets bigger ( @xmath122 ) and accordingly @xmath26 , moreover m would be poorly constrained , since the uncertainties would then be very high . but from the other data ( without the the temperature ones ) there are already stringent limits on @xmath56 and thus this way one could get lower limits on @xmath98 , under the assumption that de decays also in photons .    notice that for @xmath60 we have @xmath123 , whereas for @xmath124 the expression in the parenthesis is equal to 1 and thus @xmath125 , which for the canonical value of @xmath105 reduces to the standard expression .",
    "to test the temperature evolution for the radiation component , we rely on the cmb temperatures derived from the absorption lines of high redshift systems and the ones from sz effect in clusters of galaxies ( we will collectively quote as @xmath126 , hereafter ) . at high redshift the cmb temperature is recovered from the excitation of interstellar atomic or molecular species that have transition energies in the sub - millimetre range and can be excited by cmb photons .",
    "when the relative population of the different energy levels are in radiative equilibrium with the cmb radiation , the excitation temperature of the species equals that of the black - body radiation at that redshift , providing one of the best tools for determining the black - body temperature of the cmb in the distant universe @xcite .",
    "we used a sample of 9 qso absorption measurements @xcite . in summary",
    "we have 4 data points from the analysis of the fine structure of atomic carbon ( ac ) and 5 measurements based on the rotational excitation of co molecules ( co ) @xcite .    at lower redshift",
    "we use the measurements from the sz effect .",
    "thus , spectral measurements of galaxy clusters at different frequency bands yield independent intensity ratios for each cluster",
    ". the combinations of these measured ratios permit to extract the cosmic microwave background radiation ( see fabbri et al .",
    "we relied on the data compilation in luzzi et al .",
    "@xcite , which have analyzed the results of multifrequency sz measurements toward several clusters from 5 telescopes ( bima , ovro , suzi ii , scuba and mito ) .    ) , while the gray region is the @xmath127 uncertainty .",
    "the red line is the best fit recovered from ma @xcite ( see the legend ) .",
    "the inset panel show a magnified vision of the higher redshift region of the plot . ]",
    "we derive the observed @xmath126 from the theoretical expression @xmath128 , which we have derived in eq .",
    "( [ ma3 ] ) .",
    "we set @xmath129 , which is quite well determined in the literature @xcite , and the matter density @xmath130 to the value inferred in komatsu et al .",
    "if we take @xmath105 , then we find @xmath131 @xcite , which is lower than the estimated value of @xmath132 in @xcite , but fully consistent within uncertainties , and also pretty consistent with @xmath133 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : figt ] the temperature measurements ( together with some upper limits ) are shown , and our best fitted result is plotted and compared with the @xmath134 result in ma @xcite .",
    "the value we have found corresponds to an effective equation of state @xmath135 , consistent with @xmath136 , and the transition redshift is @xmath137 . in order to check the impact of redshift distribution we separate the data in two redshift bins with @xmath138 ( sz data only ) and @xmath139 ( qso absorption lines only ) , finding the best fitted values @xmath140 and @xmath141 , respectively .",
    "although the uncertainties are very high , it seems to emerge a mild trend with lower redshift data preferring a de decaying into matter and radiation , while data at @xmath142 point to an opposite behavior .",
    "these results could be interpreted in a different way , in fact , the differences found could be due not to the different redshift coverage , but to some particular biases in the two kind of observations , sz vs qso absorption lines .",
    "an indication of this suggestion comes if we divide the sample in three subsamples : 1 ) sz data , 2 ) the data from the analysis of the fine structure of atomic carbon ( ac ) , and 3 ) the measurements based on the rotational excitation of co molecules in @xcite .",
    "if we fit the model to the combined sz+ac and sz+co samples we find @xmath143 and @xmath144 , respectively . because of the larger measurement errors , the ac data affect very little the results when only sz measurements are adopted , and the result for the second sample shows that sz and co data mainly constrain @xmath56 , and ac simply gives a tiny reduction on the errors .    adopting a constant value for the ratio @xmath145 lima et al",
    "@xcite have found the simple relation , @xmath146 if we fit all the sample we find @xmath147 , while for the low and high redshift subsamples we have @xmath148 and @xmath149 , respectively .",
    "these results are qualitatively consistent with what found in noterdaeme et al .",
    "@xcite , and points to a similar trend as the one discussed above .    if @xmath11 is left free to change , for the best fitted value it turns out that @xmath150 and @xmath56 is systematically more positive .",
    "we find @xmath151 and @xmath152 , which corresponds to an effective equation of state @xmath153 and the transition redshift is @xmath154 .",

    "we notice that if de does not decay into radiation ( corresponding to @xmath159 and thus @xmath56 is no longer constrained ) then the cmb temperature will scale in the standard way . clearly , this would imply that if de decays , this has to be into dm only . on the other hand a deviation of the cmb temperature from the standard",
    "scaling could be interpreted as de decaying also into radiation . in which case with",
    "( [ ma3 ] ) one can determine either @xmath56 or @xmath98 and thus get some insights on the decay mode of de into radiation .",
    "future data on the cmb temperature will allow to shed light on this important issue .",
