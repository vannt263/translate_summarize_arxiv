    "the accelerated expansion has played a very important role in the history of our universe .",
    "universe is believed to have passed through inflationary phase at early epochs and there is a growing faith that it is accelerating at present .",
    "the late time acceleration of the universe , which is directly supported by supernovae observations , and indirectly , through observations of the microwave background , large scale structure and its dynamics , weak lensing and baryon oscillations , poses one of the most important challenges to modern cosmology .",
    "einstein equations in their original form , with an energy - momentum tensor for standard matter on the right hand side , can not account for the observed accelerated expansion of universe .",
    "the standard lore aimed at capturing this important effect is related to the introduction of the energy - momentum tensor of an exotic matter with large negative pressure dubbed _ dark energy _ in the einstein equations .",
    "the simplest known example of dark energy ( for recent reviews , see @xcite ) is provided by the cosmological constant @xmath1 .",
    "it does not require _ adhoc _ assumption for its introduction , as is automatically present in the einstein equations , by virtue of the bianchi identities .",
    "the field theoretic understanding of @xmath1 is far from being satisfactory .",
    "efforts have recently been made to obtain @xmath1 in the framework of string theory , what leads to a complicated landscape of de - sitter vacua .",
    "it is hard to believe that we happen to live in one of the @xmath2 vacua predicted by the theory .",
    "one might take the simplified view that , like @xmath3 , the cosmological constant @xmath1 is a fundamental constant of the classical general theory of relativity and that it should be determined from large scale observations .",
    "it is interesting to remark that the @xmath4 model is consistent with observations at present .",
    "unfortunately , the non - evolving nature of @xmath1 and its small numerical value lead to a non - acceptable fine - tuning problem .",
    "we do not know how the present scale of the cosmological constant is related to planck s or the supersymmetry breaking scale ; perhaps , some deep physics is at play here that escapes our present understanding .",
    "the fine - tuning problem , associated with @xmath1 , can be alleviated in scalar field models which do not disturb the thermal history of the universe and can successfully mimic @xmath1 at late times .",
    "a variety of scalar fields have been investigated to this end@xcite ; some of them are motivated by field / string theory and the others are introduced owing to phenomenological considerations .",
    "it is quite disappointing that a scalar field description lacks predictive power ; given _ a priori _ a cosmic evolution , one can always construct a field potential that would give rise to it .",
    "these models should , however , not be written off , and should be judged by the generic features which might arise from them .",
    "for instance , the tracker models have remarkable features allowing them to alleviate the fine - tuning and coincidence problems .",
    "present data are insufficient in order to conclude whether or not the dark energy has dynamics ; thus , the quest for the metamorphosis of dark energy continues@xcite    one can question the standard lore on fundamental grounds . we know that gravity is modified at small distance scales ; it is quite possible that it is modified at large scales too where it has never been confronted with observations directly .",
    "it is therefore perfectly legitimate to investigate the possibility of late time acceleration due to modification of einstein - hilbert action .",
    "it is tempting to study the string curvature corrections to einstein gravity amongst which the gauss - bonnet correction enjoys special status .",
    "a large number of papers are devoted to the cosmological implications of string curvature corrected gravity@xcite .",
    "these models , however , suffer from several problems .",
    "most of these models do not include tracker like solution and those which do are heavily constrained by the thermal history of universe .",
    "for instance , the gauss - bonnet gravity with dynamical dilaton might cause transition from matter scaling regime to late time acceleration allowing to alleviate the fine tuning and coincidence problems .",
    "but it is difficult to reconcile this model with nucleosynthesis@xciteconstraint .",
    "the large scale modification may also arise in extra dimensional theories like dgp model which contains self accelerating brane .",
    "apart from the theoretical problems , this model is heavily constrained by observation .",
    "on purely phenomenological grounds , one could seek a modification of einstein gravity by replacing the ricci scalar by generic function @xmath0@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 gravity theories giving rise to cosmological constant in low curvature regime are faced with difficulties which can be circumvented in @xmath0 gravity models proposed by hu - sawicki and starobinsky @xcite ( see ref.@xcite on the similar theme ) .",
    "these models can evade solar physics constraints by invoking the chameleon mechanism @xcite .",
    "an important observation has recently been made in refs.@xcite(see also ref.@xcite on the related theme ) , namely , the minimum of scalaron potential which corresponds to dark energy can be very near to @xmath5 or equivalently @xmath6 . as pointed out in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the minimum should be near the origin for solar constraints to be evaded .",
    "hence , it is most likely that we hit the singularity if the parameters are not properly fine tuned .",
    "this may have serious implications for relativistic stars@xcite .",
    "+ in what follows we shall briefly review the aforesaid developments .",
    "einstein equations exhibit simple analytical solutions in a homogeneous and isotropic universe .",
    "the dynamics in this case is described by a single function of time @xmath7 dubbed _ scale factor _ , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is designates the total energy density in the universe .",
    "three different possibilities , @xmath10 , @xmath11 or @xmath12 correspond to flat geometry , hyperbolic geometry and geometry of the sphere correspondingly .",
    "evolution can not change the nature of a particular geometry .",
    "what geometry we live in , depends upon the energy content of the universe , @xmath13 observations on cmb reveal that we live in a nearly critical universe , @xmath10 or @xmath14 which is consistent with inflationary paradigm .",
    "the equation for acceleration has the following form , @xmath15 thus an exotic fluid with large negative pressure is needed to fuel the accelerated expansion of universe .",
    "let us note that pressure corrects the energy density and positive pressure adds to deceleration where as the negative pressure contributes towards acceleration .",
    "it might look completely opposite to our intuition that highly compressed substance explodes out with tremendous impact whereas in our case pressure acts in the opposite direction .",
    "it is important to understand that our day today intuition with pressure is related to pressure force or pressure gradient . in a homogeneous universe pressure gradients",
    "can not exist .",
    "pressure is a relativistic effect and can only be understood within the frame work of general theory of relativity .",
    "pressure gradient might appear in newtonian frame work in an inhomogeneous universe but pressure in frw background can only be induced by relativistic effects .",
    "strictly speaking , it should not appear in newtonian gravity ; its contribution is negligible in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "indeed , in newtonian cosmology , acceleration of a particle on the surface of a homogeneous sphere with density @xmath9 and radius @xmath16 is given by , @xmath17 the simplest possibility of dark energy is provided by cosmological constant which does not require an _",
    "assumption for its introduction ; it is automatically present in einstein equations by virtue of bianchi identities , @xmath18 the evolution equations in this case become , @xmath19 in case the universe is dominated by @xmath1 , it follows from the continuity equation that @xmath20 and eq.([al ] ) tells us that a positive cosmological constant contributes to acceleration .",
    "observations of complimentary nature reveal that , + @xmath21 @xmath22  - cmb , + @xmath21 @xmath23  -large scale structure and its dynamics , + @xmath21 @xmath24  - high redshift ia supernove , + which is independently supported by data on baryon oscillations and weak lensing .",
    "observations at present do not rule out the _ phantom _ dark energy with @xmath25 corresponding to super acceleration . in this case",
    "the expanding solution takes the form , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an integration constant .",
    "it is easy to see that phantom dominated universe will end itself in a singularity known as _ big rip _ or _ cosmic doomsday _ , @xmath28= 6\\frac{n(n-1)+n^2}{(t_s - t)^{2}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the big rip singularity is characterized by the divergence of @xmath29 and consequently of the curvature after a finite time in future .",
    "it should be noted that when curvature becomes large , we should incorporate the higher curvature corrections to einstein - hilbert action which can modify the structure of the singularity@xcite .",
    "big rip can also be avoided in specific models of phantom energy@xcite .",
    "there are important theoretical issues related to cosmological constant .",
    "cosmological constant can be associated with vacuum fluctuations in the quantum field theoretic context . though the arguments are still at the level of numerology but may have far reaching consequences . unlike the classical theory the cosmological constant in this scheme is no longer a free parameter of the theory .",
    "broadly the line of thinking takes the following route .",
    "the quantum effects in gr become important when the einstein hilbert action becomes of the order of planck s constant ; this happens at the planck s length @xmath30 cm corresponding to planck energy which is of the order of @xmath31 .",
    "the ground state energy dubbed zero point energy or vacuum energy of a free quantum field is infinite .",
    "this contribution is related the ordering ambiguity of fields in the classical lagrangian and disappears when normal ordering is adopted . since this procedure of throwing out the vacuum energy is _ adhoc _ , one might try to cancel it by introducing the counter terms . the later",
    ", however requires fine tuning and may be regarded as unsatisfactory .",
    "the divergence is related to the modes of very small wave length .",
    "as we are ignorant of physics around the planck scale , we might be tempted to introduce a cut off at @xmath32 and associate with this a fundamental scale .",
    "thus we arrive at an estimate of vacuum energy @xmath33 ( corresponding mass scale- @xmath34 ) which is away by 120 orders of magnitudes from the observed value of this quantity .",
    "the vacuum energy may not be felt in the laboratory but plays important role in gr through its contribution to the energy momentum tensor as @xmath35 ( @xmath36)and appears on the right hand side of einstein equations .    the problem of zero point energy is naturally resolved by invoking supersymmetry which has many other remarkable features . in the supersymmetric description , every bosonic degree of freedom",
    "has its fermi counter part which contributes zero point energy with opposite sign compared to the bosonic degree of freedom thereby doing away with the vacuum energy .",
    "it is in this sense the supersymmetric theories do not admit a non - zero cosmological constant .",
    "however , we know that we do not leave in supersymmetric vacuum state and hence it should be broken . for a viable supersymmetric scenario ,",
    "for instance if it is to be relevant to hierarchy problem , the suppersymmetry breaking scale should be around @xmath37 gev .",
    "we are still away from the observed value by many orders of magnitudes . at present",
    "we do not know how planck scale or susy breaking scales is related to the observed vacuum scale .",
    "at present there is no satisfactory solution to cosmological constant problem .",
    "one might assume that there is some way to cancel the vacuum energy .",
    "one can then treat @xmath1 as a free parameter of classical gravity similar to newton constant @xmath3 .",
    "however , the small value of cosmological constant leads to several puzzles including the fine tuning and coincidence problems .",
    "the energy density in radiation at the planck scale is of the order of @xmath38 or @xmath39 thus the vacuum energy density needs to be fine tuned at the level of one part in @xmath40 around the plank epoch , in order to match the current universe .",
    "such an extreme fine tuning is absolutely unacceptable at theoretical grounds .",
    "secondly , the energy density in cosmological constant is of the same order of matter energy density at the present epoch .",
    "the question what causes this _ coincidence _ has no satisfactory answer .",
    "efforts have recently been made to understand @xmath1 within the frame work of string theory using flux compactification .",
    "string theory predicts a very complicated landscape of about @xmath2 de - sitter vacua . using anthropic principal ,",
    "we are led to believe that we live in one of these vacua !",
    "it is easier to believe in god than in these vacua !",
    "( @xmath41 is the background energy density ) .",
    "the field energy density in case of undershoot and overshoot joins the scaling solution for different initial conditions . at late times , the scalar field exits the scaling regime to become the dominant component .",
    ", width=302 ]     and @xmath41 in absence of the scaling solution .",
    "the scalar field after its energy density overshoots the background gets into locking regime and waits till its energy density becomes comparable to @xmath41 .",
    "it then begin to evolve and over takes the background .",
    "similar picture holds in case of the overshoot.,width=302 ]",
    "the fine tuning problem associate with cosmological constant led to the investigation of cosmological dynamics of a variety of scalar field systems such as quientessence , phantoms , tachyons and k - essence . in past years",
    ", the underlying dynamics of these systems has been studied in great detail .",
    "it is worthwhile to bring out the broad features that makes a particular scalar field system viable to cosmology .",
    "the scalar field model aiming to describe dark energy should possess important properties allowing it to alleviate the _ fine tuning _ and _ coincidence _ problems without interfering with the thermal history of universe .",
    "the nucleosynthesis puts an stringent constraint on any relativistic degree of freedom over and above that of the standard model of particle physics .",
    "thus a scalar field has to satisfy several important constraints if it is to be relevant to cosmology .",
    "let us now spell out some of these features in detail . in case",
    "the scalar field energy density @xmath42 dominates the background ( radiation / matter ) energy @xmath41 , the former should redshift faster than the later allowing radiation domination to commence which in tern requires a steep potential . in this case , the field energy density overshoots the background and becomes subdominant to it .",
    "this leads to the locking regime for the scalar field which unlocks the moment the @xmath42 is comparable to @xmath41 .",
    "the further course of evolution crucially depends upon the form the potential assumes at late times . for the non - interference with thermal history , we require that the scalar field remains unimportant during radiation and matter dominated eras and emerges out from the hiding at late times to account for late time acceleration . to address the issues related to fine tuning , it is important to investigate the cosmological scenarios in which the energy density of the scalar field mimics the background energy density .",
    "the cosmological solution which satisfy this condition are known as _ scaling solutions _ , @xmath43 the steep exponential potential @xmath44 with @xmath45 in the frame work of standard gr gives rise to scaling solutions .",
    "nucleosynthesis further constraints @xmath46 .",
    "the introduction of a new relativistic degree of freedom at a given temperature changes the hubble rate which crucially effects the neutron to proton for temperature of the order of one mev when weak interactions freeze out .",
    "this results into a bound on @xmath46 , namely , @xmath47 or @xmath48 . in this case , for generic initial conditions , the field ultimately enters into the scaling regime , the attractor of the dynamics and this allows to alleviate the fine tuning problem to a considerable extent .",
    "the same holds for the case of undershoot , see fig.[shoot3 ] .",
    "scaling solutions , however , are not accelerating as they mimic the background ( radiation / matter ) .",
    "one therefore needs some late time feature in the potential .",
    "there are several ways of achieving this : ( 1 ) the potential that mimics a steep exponential at early epochs and reduces to power law type @xmath49 at late times gives rise to accelerated expansion for @xmath50 as the average equation of state @xmath51 in this case@xcite .",
    "( ii ) the steep inverse power law type of potential which become shallow at large values of the field can support late time acceleration and can mimic the background at early times@xcite .",
    "the solutions which exhibit the aforesaid features are referred to as _ tracker _ solutions . for a viable cosmic evolution",
    "we need a tracker like solution .",
    "recently , a variety of scalar field models such as tachyon and phantom were investigated as candidates of dark energy . in case of tachyon with equation of state parameter ranging from @xmath52 to @xmath53 ,",
    "there exists no scaling solution which could mimic the realistic background ( radiation / matter ) . scaling solution which are possible in this case",
    "are associated with negative equation of state and are not of interest . in case of phantom scalar fields ( scalar fields with negative kinetic energy ) , there is no fixed point corresponding to scaling solution .",
    "these scenarios suffer from the fine tuning problem ; dynamics in this case acquires dependence on initial conditions@xcite ( see fig.[shoot2 ] ) .    the second approach to late tim acceleration",
    "is related to the modification of left hand side of einstein equations or the geometry of space time . in the past few years , several schemes of large scale modifications have been actively investigated . in what follows",
    ", we shall briefly describe the modified theories of gravity and their relevance to cosmology .",
    "in view of the above discussion , it is perfectly legitimate to investigate the possibility of late time acceleration due to modification of einstein - hilbert action .",
    "some of these modifications are inspired by fundamental theories of high energy physics where as the others are based upon phenomenological considerations .",
