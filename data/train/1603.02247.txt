    "the rod ( impactor ) always remains strongly attached to the suspension and the coupling is only limited by the formation of cracks at very high stresses @xcite .",
    "however , for the case of extension , there is a sudden detachment of the jammed suspension from the pulling plate . for suspensions showing discontinuous shear thickening ( dst ) ,",
    "the maximum stress scale is provided by the confining capillary pressure at the suspension - air interface @xcite which is proportional to @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the surface tension of suspension - air interface and @xmath56 is the typical diameter of the particles . to test for the role of capillary effects in setting the peak force in our system , we get rid of the effective surface tension of the suspension air interface by pouring a layer ( @xmath11 1 cm deep ) of solvent above the suspension so",

    "this indicates that the adhesion strength between the plate and the suspension plays an important role in setting the peak stress . to see the importance of adhesion strength between the plate and the suspension",
    ", we compare the average stress response when the the initial position of the plate just touches the suspension ( fig .",

    "this is supported by the fact that within experimental error the two curves match up well before the detachment ( fig . [",
    "similar behavior can also be seen in fig .",
    "[ f1]c .",
    "although the jamming mechanism is similar for both impact and extension , it may seem conceptually difficult to understand how extensional deformation can impart high normal stress on the plate . in the case of impact activated solidification ( ias ) ,",
    "once the jamming front hits the container boundary , there is a solid - like jammed region that extends between the point of impact and the container wall .",
    "to push the impactor further involves deforming this solid - like jammed region that requires huge amount of stress .",
    "this explains the sharp rise in stresses observed in ias .",
    "however , in case of extensile deformations such picture is no longer valid , since we are not pushing against such solid - like jammed region , but rather pulling away from it .",
    "to resolve this issue we proposed a dynamic model based on darcy flow arguments as discussed next .",
    "we note that , just before the detachment , the plate still moves at a constant velocity and for continuity it tends to draw the solvent into the jammed network of particles .",

    ", the lower stress along the rim , due to the reduced path length , leads to breakage of the solvent layer at the rim before the maximum stress is reached .",
    "this can give rise to a dynamic delamination leading to eventual full detachment . while the exact mechanism remains to be explored ,",
    "we believe that the competition between the dynamic delamination process and steady state solvent drainage sets the value of peak stress observed in our experiments .",
    "this is corroborated by the observation that the peak stresses scale linearly with @xmath0 and @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ f11 ] ) .",
    "our results , and in particular the observation of frustums with clearly defined , angled side walls , directly indicate that sufficiently rapid extension can lead to a transformation of a dense suspension from fluid to solid .",
    "this goes beyond shear - thickening and implies dynamic jamming , i.e. , the reconfiguration into a system with a finite yield stress .",
    "our study finds that the transient jamming dynamics under extension in a dense granular suspension in many ways closely resemble those under impact .",
    "in particular , in both situations dynamic shear jamming fronts are generated that propagate downward into the bulk of the suspension at speeds larger than the pulling or impact speed . at high pulling speed",
    ", the jammed region strongly couples the moving plate and the suspension giving rise to strong shear flow along the propagating front . the extent to which such shear can induce jamming depends , according to current models , on the degree of frictional interaction between particles @xcite .",

    "we estimate the average stress on the top plate due to solvent drainage through the fully saturated jammed granular bed from the kozeny - carman relationship .    the classic kozeny - carman ( k - c ) relationship is given by , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the thickness of the granular bed .",
    "the drainage happens mainly through the paths of least resistance and for simplicity we assume that it happens along the top surface of the frustum in a region very close to the plate ( see fig .",
    "[ f14 ] ) .",
    "under this situation , we need to take into account the variable path length @xmath66 as a function of @xmath67 and estimate the local pressure @xmath68 , which can then be integrated to estimate the average stress on the plate .",
    "the differential force on the top plate from the drainage ( at a constant velocity @xmath63 ) through the ring of radius @xmath67 and width @xmath69 ( the distance of the ring circumference from the rim of the plate is @xmath70 ) : @xmath71 @xmath72 which can be written as , @xmath73    where @xmath36 is the plate radius and @xmath74 .",
    "the total force on the top plate therefore is @xmath75    @xmath76_{0}^{r_p } = k\\,{r_p}^3 / 6 $ ] . for the stress measured by pulling on the top plate this gives @xmath77 .",
    "putting in the value of @xmath78 from eq.(a2 ) we find @xmath79 , which is the one third of the classic k - c value [ eq.(a1 ) ] for the pressure drop over a granular bed of length @xmath36 . putting in typical values",
    "we see that the drainage through the sidewall ( i.e. , through the path of least resistance ) at a constant velocity corresponds to an average stress of @xmath12 3 mpa in steady state . however , we note that along the rim [ @xmath80 in eq.(a1 ) ] the plate can locally pull out some solvent at a much lower stress of @xmath12 9 kpa",
    ". the breakage of the solvent at the rim can give rise to a dynamic delamination process as mentioned in the main text .    as we noted before",
    ", this scenario simplifies the actual situation and should only be taken as an estimate for the theoretical upper limit to the pulling force . besides not accounting for the dynamical delamination process , the scenario also assumes that upper surface of the frustum is completely flat and in perfect contact with the plate , which may not always be the case .",
    "this issue is underscored by the observation that the peak force depends to some degree on how far the pulling plate is pressed initially against the suspension surface .",
    "however , the qualitative applicability of this scenario is confirmed by the observed scaling of the pulling force with pulling speed , packing fraction and solvent viscosity .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "the lubrication stress between two particles having a separation @xmath81 between surfaces of the particles is given by , @xmath82 where @xmath2 , the solvent viscosity = 8 mpas and @xmath0 is the relative velocity between the particles .",
    "we found that beyond a packing fraction @xmath83 0.5 for rice - starch particles , the suspension forms big clumps and becomes very difficult to mix .",
    "however , for cornstarch suspension mixing becomes difficult at a higher value of @xmath84 0.56 ) .",
    "thus , we need to stay below this packing fractions to ensure the homogeneity of the suspension .",
    "although starch particles have irregular shapes , for the sake of calculation we assume them to be randomly distributed hard spheres having average diameter @xmath56 . under this assumption , for @xmath1 = 0.52 , @xmath85 and for for @xmath1 = 0.46 , @xmath86 . for cornstarch particles , a @xmath11 12.5 @xmath13 m and for rice - starch particles , a @xmath11 2 @xmath13 m . to estimate an upper limit of the stress predicted by lubrication theory , we assume @xmath0 to be the pulling velocity .",
    "putting in the values in eq.(b1 ) , we get the peak stress values for cornstarch suspension to be 2.3 kpa and 0.87 kpa for @xmath0 = 8 mm / s and 3 mm / s , respectively . for rice - starch ,",
    "the peak stress for @xmath0 = 8 mm / s is 7.5 kpa and for @xmath0 = 3 mm / s , the peak stress is 2.8 kpa .",
    "these values are well below the experimentally observed peak stresses , as shown in fig .",
    "these observations indicate that the lubrication forces between the particles are not setting the upper limits of the observed stresses under extension ."
