    "socio - economic inequality  @xcite is manifested in the existence of unequal rewards and opportunities for social positions or statuses in a society .",
    "structured , recurrent patterns of unequal distributions of goods , wealth , opportunities , rewards and punishments are mainly measured in terms of _ inequality of conditions _ , and _ inequality of opportunities_. the former refers to the unequal distribution of income , wealth and material goods , while the latter refers to the unequal distribution of ` life chances ' of individuals .",
    "this is somehow reflected in measures such as level of education , health status , and treatment by the criminal justice system .",
    "socio - economic inequality often results in crisis , political unrest and instability , conflict , war , criminal activity and finally affects economic growth  @xcite .",
    "initially , economic inequalities were studied in the context of income and wealth  @xcite , but the notions and observations have led to widespread research , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for various socio - economic inequalities .",
    "the study of inequality in society  @xcite is a topic of global focus and utmost current interest , bringing together researchers from various disciplines .    by the end of the 19th century ,",
    "pareto  @xcite made extensive studies and found that wealth distribution in europe follows a power law for the rich , commonly known to be the _",
    "pareto law_. subsequent studies have revealed that the distributions of income and wealth possess some globally robust features ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : the bulk of both the income and wealth distributions seem to reasonably fit both the log - normal and the gamma distributions .",
    "economists have a preference for the log - normal distribution  @xcite , while statisticians  @xcite and physicists  @xcite root for the gamma distribution for the probability density or gibbs / exponential distribution for the corresponding cumulative distribution .",
    "the high end of the distribution , known as the ` tail ' , is well described by a power law as observed by pareto .",
    "formally , the probability distribution of wealth is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a constant and @xmath3 is called the pareto exponent , ranging between 1 and 3  @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a historical account of pareto s data and some recent sources ) .",
    "@xmath4 is some function which could be exponential , gamma or lognormal .",
    "the crossover point @xmath5 is extracted from the numerical fittings .",
    "one of the key class of models uses the kinetic theory of gases  @xcite , where the gas molecules colliding and exchanging energy was mapped to agents meeting to exchange wealth , following certain rules  @xcite . in these models ,",
    "a pair of agents agree to trade , each save a fraction @xmath6 of their instantaneous money / wealth and exchanges a random fraction of the rest at each trading step .",
    "the distribution of wealth in the steady state , @xmath7 matches well with the empirical data .",
    "when the saving fraction @xmath6 is fixed , i.e. , in case of homogeneous agents ( cc model hereafter )  @xcite , @xmath7 are very well approximated to gamma distributions  @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that , in reality , the richest follow a different dynamic where heterogeneity plays the key role . to obtain the power law distribution of wealth for the richest ,",
    "one needs simply to consider each agent as different in terms of the fraction of wealth he / she saves in each trading  @xcite , which is very natural to assume , because it is quite likely that agents in a market think differently from one another . with this",
    "very little modification , one can explain the whole range of wealth distribution  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath6 is distributed uniformly in @xmath8 and quenched , ( ccm model hereafter ) , i.e. , for heterogeneous agents , one obtains a pareto law for the probability density of wealth @xmath9 with exponent @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "several variants of these models , find possible applications in a variety of trading processes  @xcite .",
    "socio - economic inequalities are quantified in various ways .",
    "the most popular measures are absolute , in terms of indices , e.g. , gini  @xcite , theil  @xcite , pietra  @xcite and the recently introduced @xmath0 index  @xcite .",
    "the alternative approach is a relative measure , in terms of probability distributions of various quantities , but the most of the above mentioned indices can be computed from the distributions .",
    "most quantities often display broad distributions , usually lognormals , power - laws or their combinations .",
    "for example , the distribution of income is usually an exponential followed by a power law  @xcite ( see ref.@xcite for other examples ) .    to compute the gini index , one has to consider the lorenz curve  @xcite , that represents the cumulative proportion @xmath11 of ordered individuals ( from lowest to highest ) in terms of the cumulative proportion of their sizes @xmath12 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : emp]a ) .",
    "@xmath11 can represent income or wealth of individuals . the gini index ( @xmath13 )",
    "is defined as the ratio between the area enclosed between the lorenz curve and the equality line , to that below the equality line . if the area between ( i ) the equality line and the lorenz curve is @xmath14 , and ( ii ) that below the lorenz curve as @xmath15 , the gini index is given by @xmath16 . the recently introduced ` @xmath0 index '  @xcite",
    "is defined as the fraction @xmath0 such that @xmath17 fraction of individuals possess @xmath0 fraction of income or wealth ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : emp]a )  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the inequality in wealth in some models of wealth distribution which are inspired by kinetic theory of gases .",
    "we mainly discuss the results for two well studied models ( cc and ccm ) and a new model for bimodal distribution of wealth .",
    "we numerically compute the inequality indices , gini index and @xmath0-index to quantify the inequalities .",
    "gini index @xmath13 , the most popular and widely used measure for inequality in case of income and wealth distribution , can take value from @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "the value @xmath20 refers to complete equality and @xmath21 represents completely inequality .",
    "the meaning of @xmath0-index , say , for a wealth distribution , is the following : @xmath0 fraction of the top wealthiest people possess @xmath22 fraction of total wealth .",
    "we found that in both cc and ccm models there are some upper and lower limits of the indices . for cc model",
    ", @xmath13 varies between @xmath18 and @xmath23 , and @xmath0 from @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "similarly , for ccm model , @xmath13 varies between @xmath25 to @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , both models independently do not cover the possible theoretical range of values of @xmath13 and @xmath0 .",
    "we find that the range of @xmath13 as found from empirical data ( @xmath27 ) ( see fig .  [ fig : emp ] , using world bank data  @xcite ) can be well covered by ccm model .",
    "we also considered a model where two groups of agents have fixed but different saving propensities .",
    "depending on the combinations , the resulting probability distribution of wealth is found to be unimodal or bimodal .",
    "the phase boundaries , depending on the ratio of the two groups and the combination of values of their saving propensities are also computed numerically .",
    "the bimodal distribution seems to fit well to a combination of two gamma distributions ( double -gamma distribution ) .",
    "gini index and @xmath0 index are calculated for this model for different combination of parameters .",
    "next , we considered gamma and double - gamma distribution and computed certain quantities like lorenz curve and gini indices .",
    "kinetic exchange models of wealth distributions  @xcite serve as simple paradigmatic models for exchange of wealth in an economy .",
    "the main idea is that agents possess wealth @xmath28 which is redistributed upon trading with others .",
    "the ` economy ' is assumed to be a ` closed ' one , in the sense that neither the number of agents change nor does that total amount of wealth in the system , and the economic activity is limited to exchange of wealth according to certain rules .",
    "the basic model in the framework is just the random sharing of wealth , motivated by random exchange of energy between gas molecules , as in the framework of kinetic theory of gases  @xcite .",
    "the basic money exchange model  @xcite imitates the kinetic exchange in an ideal gas , but subsequently developed models incorporate the notion of ` savings ' . in the following ,",
    "we discuss these models , and also compute the inequality measures like gini and @xmath0-index .",
    "savings come as a natural ingredient in a trading economy . in each trading step , a pair of agents exchange their wealth in the following way : they keep a fixed fraction @xmath6 of their wealth to themselves and the rest @xmath29 fraction is pooled up to be randomly split among the two  @xcite . in this model ( cc model hereafter ) , agents are homogeneous  all of them save the same fraction of their instantaneous wealth at each trading step .",
