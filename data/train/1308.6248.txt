    "high - temperature superconductivity is among the most active areas of research in condensed matter physics , with most of the focus on the initially discovered cuprates @xcite and the newer iron - based superconductors .",

    "@xcite    understanding the microscopic hamiltonian would shed light on superconducting and normal state properties .",
    "for example , inter - orbital electron - electron interactions , possibly driven by strong electron - phonon coupling , yield @xmath7-wave superconductivity from orbital fluctuations.@xcite these naturally give rise to orbital ordering ( oo ) .",
    "alternatively , strong intra - orbital interactions , driven by spin fluctuations , produce @xmath8- or @xmath9-wave superconductivity.@xcite this naturally results in anisotropic spin - density waves ( sdw ) from nesting in the parent compound . such interactions",
    "may also lead to os , @xcite for example via nematic spin fluctuations .",
    "@xcite this view may be supported if the os is much smaller at the brillouin zone ( bz ) center than the zone boundary , whereas a similar os throughout would allow for ferroorbital ordering as the cause .",

    ", there are two be , one with @xmath4 character and another one with @xmath5 character . we follow the ldos at their energies as the bands evolve with increasing @xmath35 .",
    "the ldos patterns are outlined in red ( green ) at the energy of the be of the @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) band .",
    "the patterns outlined at @xmath104  mev ( @xmath105  mev ) for the @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) band are very similar to each other and distinct from the other patterns ; when the energy of the band at the zone center shifts to a new value , there is a corresponding ldos pattern that also shifts to this new value . in contrast , patterns at other energies are not as sensitive to small os changes , as seen by comparing the two patterns not outlined at the energies @xmath106 or @xmath107  mev .",
    "we show this splitting effect at os magnitudes of 30 and 60 mev , and it is robust down to the resolution limit of around 10 mev .",
    "this leads to one clear signature of os : as one increases os , there are two ldos patterns that increasingly shift away from each other , leaving the other patterns unchanged . measuring the energy separation between these two patterns yields the magnitude of os .",
    "these patterns display a rotation relation that is unique to os : applying a @xmath108 rotation about the @xmath109 axis to the ldos pattern corresponding to the @xmath4 be yields the @xmath5 pattern , because the orbitals themselves interchange under this rotation .",
    "the similarity is however not perfect because of contributions from other orbitals and different bands at these energies , as explained below .",
    "these two patterns superimpose at the same energy for @xmath110 , where the two be are degenerate .",
    "os is therefore identified by two patterns at nearby energies that mostly map onto each other under 90@xmath111 rotation ; these patterns superimpose at high temperatures where a putative os is small .",
    "although qpi is the fourier transform of the ldos , it only exhibits part of the os signatures and seems less suitable for tracking os .",
    "[ fig : osmig_qpi](a ) shows the qpi patterns at the same energies and @xmath35 values as in the outlined ldos patterns in fig .",
    "[ fig : osmig_ldos ] .",
    "the patterns at @xmath105  mev match , tracking the @xmath5 be as os increases .",
    "however , one does not obtain a @xmath4 pattern shifting at lower energies .",
    "there is thus no signature of two patterns that map onto each other under @xmath1 rotation .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath4 pattern is obscured by contributions from other orbitals .",
    "this is seen by projecting out these contributions in fig .",
    "[ fig : osmig_qpi](b ) , plotting only the @xmath4 and @xmath5 contributions .",
    "this recovers the full os signature : two qpi patterns shift away from each other with increasing os and these two patterns map onto each other under @xmath108 rotation ( apart from minor obscuring at @xmath112  mev due to other @xmath4 contributions ) .",
    "however , this projection is not currently feasible in experiments .",
    "conversely , in the total ldos , contributions from other orbitals are concentrated within two sites of the impurity , but they are less significant at further distances where os patterns appear",
    ". therefore , the ldos seems to be a better probe than qpi for detecting and measuring os .    the reason that ldos tracks be is understood by considering the ldos s relation to the band structure .",
    "a be can cause a distinct sts pattern due to its large spectral weight in a small part of @xmath113 space .",
    "the resulting qpi pattern resembles the constant energy contour ( cec ) of the bands at the energy of the be , similar to the observed spectra in the superconducting state .",
    "@xcite the corresponding ldos pattern follows the be energy as it shifts .",
    "this also explains the @xmath108 rotation relation : due to intra - orbital scattering , the be only scatters to portions of the cec of similar orbital content , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cecos ] .",
    "since the @xmath4 and @xmath5 portions follow the rotation relation , the same relation appears in the ldos patterns . in summary",
    ", os can be identified and tracked by the temperature ( or @xmath35 ) dependence of two distinctive ldos patterns , similar under @xmath1 rotation , that split in energies corresponding to the be .",
    "the measurement of the os magnitude and the comparison to the sdw gap may clarify the dependence of os on magnetism .",
    "we treated the case of large os at the zone center , which is only predicted by theories such as ferroorbital ordering .",
    "@xcite in scenarios like os driven by spin fluctuations , @xcite where os at the zone center is much smaller , sts may still measure it . also , os is larger at other momenta , and be at the corresponding energies would produce @xmath1-rotated patterns .",
    "another possibility is that sdw causes os as bands of similar orbitals repel each other .",
    "this is noticeable in fig .",
    "[ fig : bands](b ) , where the @xmath5 gapping shifts the upper band above the @xmath4 band . however , this repulsion can shift two bands apart by at most the sdw gap magnitude .",
    "moreover , we find the sdw - induced os to be much smaller than the average sdw gap , by more than an order of magnitude at the zone center , for example ( fig . [",
    "fig : bands](b ) ) .",
    "this is also suggested in fig .",
    "[ fig : mij](b ) by the small difference in orbital occupation , reaching a maximum of 0.02 .",
    "therefore , observing os of the same order as an sdw gap would imply that they are mostly independent of the sdw , and an even larger os would definitively rule out sdw gaps as the sole cause .",
    "conversely , a small os allows for a dependence on the sdw , and momentum dependence may further support the connection to spin fluctuations .      in principle , any be that shifts in energy leaves a signature in the ldos . here , we present signatures of be splitting due to an sdw gap using @xmath79 .",
    "the inclusion of os does not change the qualitative conclusions . for",
    "the sdw itself these signatures may not provide new information , as the spatially uniform dos is often sufficient to measure gaps .",
    "however , to identify os as in the previous section , one needs to distinguish it from other forms of be splitting .",
    "we show several differences for the sdw and highlight that pattern similarity under 90@xmath111 rotation is unique to os .",
    "the ldos may track an sdw gap magnitude by be splitting in a manner different from os , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sdwmig_ldos ] .",
    "as temperature decreases , an sdw band gap bordered by two be grows . at each temperature , we plot the ldos at the energies of the be . as for os alone , we find two patterns at @xmath114  mev ( @xmath115  mev ) that are similar . for the sdw , these patterns track the gap magnitude .",
    "however , several features are attributed specifically to the sdw rather than os : the patterns of the two be are similar without any rotation ; a strong positive @xmath102 is visible close to the impurity while a negative @xmath102 extends away from it in the y direction .",
    "this similarity is caused by be on either gap edge having similar orbital content , since they originate from the same magnetic bz ( mbz ) crossing point .",
    "additionally , unlike os for @xmath110 , there is no be pattern at @xmath80 , since the gap closes and its be disappear .",
    "furthermore , these signatures are not as clear as those of os because the sdw reconstructs the bands , which alters the be pattern as temperature decreases . also , there are more contributions from other bands in the energy range of the sdw gaps than the be that orbitally split .",
    "note that these splitting effects are shown for sdw gaps of 30 and 60  mev and are robust down to the resolution limit of around 10   mev .",
    "thus , although the ldos patterns split for both sdw and os , os is distinguishable in several ways .    in qpi ,",
    "these sdw signatures are again obscured by other orbitals , supporting the idea that be signatures are easier to see in the ldos rather than qpi .",
    "the ldos patterns are not obscured by other orbital contributions that are concentrated near the impurity .",
    "conversely , in fig .",
    "[ fig : sdwmig_qpi](a ) , the full qpi at the same energies and temperatures as the ldos s in fig .",
    "[ fig : sdwmig_ldos ] do not show sdw signatures . only when projecting out orbitals other than @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sdwmig_qpi](b ) ) are the two patterns at @xmath114  mev ( @xmath115  mev ) similar , with features encircling @xmath116 and @xmath48 .",
    "unlike os , all four patterns bear some similarity without rotation . again , this is understood by considering the cec : since both be are of @xmath5 content , they scatter to the same portions of the cec , resulting in patterns similar without rotation .      detecting and measuring os magnitudes in the ldos may be used to understand whether os is driven by sdw order .",
    "os and the sdw appear to cooperate , since they both decrease in magnitude with doping . furthermore , theoretical studies have shown that os enhances the magnetic moment .",
    "@xcite our results also indicate that os and sdw enhance each other , and there are ldos features of be splitting that can be attributed to this interdependence .",
    "the emergence of sdw order in an orbitally split state increases the os magnitude,@xcite which is observable in sts .",
    "we model again os+sdw by @xmath79 with @xmath37  mev at @xmath117  k ( vs. @xmath118  k ) , like the os determined experimentally at @xmath80 .",
    "@xcite we find that the sdw increases the os magnitude from 60  mev to 83  mev , observable in ldos as an increase in the splitting between the be patterns .",
    "this os enhancement is understood by considering the bands ; it is an example of a more general cooperation with an sdw .",
    "[ fig : enhancemp](a ) compares the bands for os only to those of os+sdw .",
    "it shows that the sdw moves the bands with @xmath5 ( @xmath4 ) content near @xmath119 to higher ( lower ) energies , leading to an increase of the os magnitude observed in the sts patterns .",
    "this occurs because the sdw involves bands of similar orbitals that repel each other ( sec . [ sec : theory ] ) .",
    "this os enhancement occurs throughout the bz since the sdw - induced repulsion moves bands with @xmath5 ( @xmath4 ) content across @xmath10 ( arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : enhancemp](a ) ) , decreasing ( increasing ) its occupation .",
    "this is verified by an increase in the orbital polarization per site , @xmath72 , from 0.12 to 0.16 .    on the other hand",
    ", os also enhances the sdw : as highlighted by the arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig : enhancemp](b ) , adding os to the state with no mean fields ( @xmath120 ) shifts a @xmath5 band crossing in the mbz closer to @xmath10 .",
    "this improves the fermi surface nesting and thereby sdw .",
    "@xcite the zero - temperature magnetic moment increases from 0.43 for sdw only to 0.68 for os+sdw with @xmath121  mev . in summary",
    ", there is two - way cooperation between os and sdw throughout the bz , as exemplified by the increased os magnitude in the sts splitting .",
    "this leaves the question whether os not only cooperates but is even driven by the sdw , which ldos signatures of os may address .",
    "in this work , we theoretically propose new experiments to identify features of each of os and sdw and to clarify their interplay .",
    "our theory employs a realistic five - orbital model with a self - consistently determined mean - field sdw . as temperature",
    "is decreased , two be features in the ldos are observed to shift away from each other , tracking os or the sdw gap .",
    "these features are easier to detect in the ldos than in qpi , where they are obscured by contributions from other orbitals . for os",
    ", the features approximately map onto each other under @xmath1 rotation , whereas sdw features are similar without rotation .",
    "the energy difference between be identified by sts patterns is the os magnitude .",
    "this addresses os dependence on magnetism because a small os at the zone center would support spin fluctuations or allow sdw gaps as the cause .",
    "conversely , an os magnitude that exceeds gap magnitudes can not be solely caused by sdw gaps .",
    "also , observing os above @xmath3 would address os dependence on orthorhombicity .",
    "finally , considering sdw and os together , we obtained their magneto - orbital cooperation as the sdw onset increases os .",
    "these results suggest further steps to discover os signatures in experiments . unlike arpes , sts can access energies above @xmath10 , which may allow one to probe os at the bz center .",
    "the model presented here employs a large os for demonstration , but the existence and magnitude of os in zone center bands above @xmath10 remains yet to be seen .",
    "if that os is much smaller than at the zone boundary , this may support nematic spin fluctuations as the mechanism , @xcite consistent with @xmath8- or @xmath9-wave superconductivity .",
    "@xcite conversely , if the os is not momentum dependent , that would support the ferroorbital ordering mechanism , consistent with @xmath7-wave superconductivity .",
    "@xcite    to experimentally search for os in @xmath122 conductance measurements , the following steps seem appropriate .",
    "a search within 100 mv above @xmath10 is promising because there is not much interference from other bands .",
    "the signatures are easier to distinguish from background in a temperature sweep ( fig .",
    "[ fig : osmig_ldos ] ) . since the os is the main change in the bands for @xmath123 , this temperature range is most suitable to avoid interfering effects .",
    "os would appear as two 90@xmath111 rotated patterns at nearby voltages that split with decreasing temperature .",
    "further analysis may include an autocorrelation analysis and a subtraction between sts patterns at the same voltage for two nearby temperatures .",
    "note that our model does not account for sts resolution issues and tunneling matrix elements .",
    "however , since the proposed signatures are qualitative , they may be observable .",
    "we have analyzed be splitting in the iron pnictides , but the concept of ldos and qpi tracking a be energy can naturally be applied to other materials of interest .",
    "convenient materials would have fewer low energy bands to obscure the be shifting , and be at high symmetry points would present the clearest signatures .",
    "the advantage is that many experimental techniques , including sts , still lack systematic means of identifying orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , our suggestion of observing os in sts without the need for orbital resolution may be broadly applicable to transition metal oxide systems with partially filled orbitals .",
