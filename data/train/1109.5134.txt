    "the aim of physical theory is to represent reality ( e.g. bunge 1967 ) .",
    "a basic assumption of science is that there are things in the world , and that things have properties ( this is an ontological hypothesis ) .",
    "properties can be represented by mathematical functions and other abstract objects invented by human beings according to self - consistent rules ( e.g. bunge 2006 ) .",
    "the value of the functions and the structure of the mathematical objects of the theory are restricted by equations and mathematical conditions that represent physical laws , i.e. restrictions to the possible space of states of things .",
    "when the properties of things change , we say that there is an _",
    "event_. an event is specified by an ordered pair of states of a thing ( see bunge 1977 and the appendix below ) .",
    "each state is characterized by a collection of values of state functions .",
    "of course , the characterization of a thing is not unique .",
    "a specific model of a thing depends on those aspects of reality that the theory concerns about .",
    "the succession of events ( or processes ) that occur to a thing forms its _",
    "any physical theory refers to some kind of concrete entities .",
    "the existence of these entities is assumed by the theory .",
    "if the theory is successful , we gain confidence on the existence of the entities . if the theory fails , we can consider the postulated entities just as exploratory hypothesis that may be abandoned .",
    "for instance , the standard model of particle physics assumes the existence of different kind of _ quantons _ : leptons , quarks , and interaction bosons .",
    "the existence of @xmath0 and @xmath1 bosons was a working hypothesis of the electroweak interaction model till the particles were discovered in experiments at the end of the 1970s .",
    "now , they are considered as real as photons .",
    "tachyons , on the contrary , are currently discredited as constituents of the world , because of both theoretical reasons and lack of observational evidence .",
    "other particles , like the higgs boson , remain hypothetical but plausible so far .    the kind of objects that physical theories assume as elements of the world can change as our knowledge of the world evolves . from plants , animals , and planets to elementary particles and quark stars , our view of the universe can change , changing what we think there is , how things are , and how they relate .",
    "general relativity is the theory of space , time and gravitation formulated by albert einstein in 1915 ( einstein 1916 ) .",
    "it is an extraordinarily successful theory that has passed many test , both in the weak and strong field limits .",
    "it is a highly complex theory where the gravitational field is described through the curvature of space - time .",
    "the field equations are ten non - linear differential equations in the coefficients of the metric tensor of space - time .",
    "the theory reaches its maximum predictive power when expressed independently of coordinates in the language of abstract differential geometry . in this formulation ,",
    "known as the _ manifold model of space - time _",
    "( e.g. hawking & ellis 1973 , joshi 1993 ) , the appearance of coordinate singularities as that in schwarzschild s solution can be avoided .",
    "the theory can be applied from compact objects with strong gravity to the whole universe .",
    "the basic concept of this formulation of general relativity is the concept of _ space - time _ , introduced by hermann minkowski in 1908 ( minkowski 1909 ) .",
    "space - time can be defined as _",
    "the ontological sum of all events of all things_. this is not a mere set , which is a mathematical object ( i.e. a fiction ) , but an emergent relational property of all things . everything that has happened , everything that happens , everything that will happen , is just an element of space - time .",
    "as it is the case with every physical property , we can represent space - time with some mathematical structure , in order to describe it . the mathematical structure and",
    "the property represented should not be confused : the correspondence is never perfect , it always remain tentative .",
    "the manifold model of space - time adopts the following mathematical structure : + _ space - time can be represented by a @xmath2 differentiable , 4-dimensional , real manifold . _ + a real 4-d manifold is a set that can be covered completely by subsets whose elements are in a one - to - one correspondence with subsets of @xmath3 .",
    "every event is represented by a point of the manifold ( the converse is not necessary true ) .",
    "each element of the manifold _ represents _ an event .",
    "we adopt 4 dimensions because it seems enough to give 4 real numbers to localize an event ( i.e. to provide a minimum characterization ) .",
    "we can always provide a set of 4 real numbers for every event , and this can be done independently of the intrinsic geometry of the manifold . if there are more than a single characterization of an event , we can always find a transformation law between the different coordinate systems .",
    "this is a basic property of manifolds .",
    "if we want to calculate distances between two events , we need more structure on the manifold : we need a geometric structure .",
    "we can get it introducing a metric tensor field @xmath4 to determine distances .",
    "the infinitesimal separation between two elements of the manifold , which represent two events of space - time , is given by :    @xmath5    space - time , then , is fully represented by an order pair @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the manifold and @xmath8 is the metric tensor field . in general relativity the metric of space - time is determined by the energy - momentum of the physical systems through the einstein s field equations .",
    "the metric itself then represents the gravitational potential and its derivatives determine the equations of motion through the affine connection of the manifold .",
    "as it is the case of any other physical theory , the manifold model of space - time assumes some entities that are represented mathematically .",
    "the basic assumption here is the existence of what is represented by the points of the manifold : the totality of events , the changes of all things ( and , hence , of such things , since there are no changes without changing things ) .",
    "since the manifold is 4 dimensional , a process , or even the whole history of a 3-dimensional thing , can be represented by a 4-dimensional object ( e.g. heller 1990 , balashov 2010 ) .",
    "although human experience of change can be used to inspire the concept of manifold , once it is adopted , we can describe space - time from a 4-dimensional point of view , where there is no global change .",
    "change of space - time would require an extra dimension not included in space - time .",
    "this , in turn , would imply that space - time is a thing with an emergent relational property that should be measured by the extra dimension or ` meta - time ' .",
    "there is no physical reason to introduce such an ontology . and",
    "if someone is willing to pay the price to do it , an infinite regress follows immediately , since the 5d ` super space - time ' might change requiring more extra dimensions ontological inflation would turn the price unaffordable .",
    "strings of changes and irreversible processes of physical things are described by asymmetries , intrinsic features , of space - time .",
    "dynamics is the result of comparing different slices of space - time .",
    "the ` present ' is not a moving thing .",
    "it is just a concept , a class of events .",
    "all this conforms the so - called _ block universe _ ontology ( e.g. smart 1963 , balashov 2010 ) .",
    "this view was also expressed , rather poetically , by hermann weyl ( weyl 1949 ) :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the objective world simply is , it does not happen . only to the gaze of my consciousness , crawling upward along the life line of my body , does a section of this world come to life as a fleeting image in space which continuously changes in time . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _",
    "parmenides was born and lived in elea , a town on the west cost of southern italy , from the end of the 6th century to the mid 5th century bc .",
    "he wrote a poem in hexameters entitled _ on what is_. almost the whole first part of the poem and fragments of the second part have survived thanks to simplicius , who copied part of the text in the 6th century ad into his commentary of aristotle s _",
    "physics_.    the first part of the poem is called _ the way of truth_. this piece contains the first known example of a deductive system applied to physical reality .",
    "parmenides was not content just with giving his view of the world .",
    "he supported his interpretation of world by logical deduction from what he considered self - evident premises .",
    "he stated that there is no change , no becoming , no coming to be .",
    "reality turns out to be unchanging , eternal , motionless , perfect , and single .",
    "there is just one thing : the world .",
    "his monism is absolute .",
    "what we think is a changing world is only the result of illusion and deception .",
    "the premises of parmenides argument can be written as :    * what is , is .",
    "* what is not , is not .",
    "then , nothing can come to be from what is not , because ` what is not ' is not something .",
    "_ creatio ex nihilo _ is nonsense .",
    "change is impossible since , for parmenides , change is the occupation of empty space , but there can not be ` empty space ' .",
    "reality must then be an unchanging block .",
    "many centuries later , with the advent of field theories it became clear that change can occur even in a full universe : change does not require empty space .",
    "a perturbation in a field that fills the whole universe is a change .",
    "the concept of change is central to the manifold model of space - time .",
    "but once the geometry of the manifold is determined by a tensor field representing the distribution of energy and momentum , its structure is fixed .",
    "the universe is represented by the triplet @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the tensor field that represents the properties ( energy and momentum ) of things .",
    "points of the manifold represent events , but there is no event or change affecting the space - time as a whole .",
    "the four dimensional space - time , mathematically represented by the manifold , is unchanging , eternal , motionless , single , just as the parmenidean universe .",
    "what we call irreversible processes are described by asymmetries in the manifold .",
    "the objects that populate the universe are 4-dimensional .",
    "they have ` temporal parts ' , as well as spatial parts . in this way , the child i was , is just a part of a larger being , i , that is 4-dimensional . what we call ` birth ' and ` death ' are just temporal boundaries of such a being .",
    "change appears only when we consider 3-dimensional slices of 4-dimensional objects . in words of max tegmark :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ time is the fourth dimension .",
    "the passage of time is an illusion .",
    "we have this illusion of a changing , three - dimensional world , even though nothing changes in the four dimensional union of space and time of einstein s relativity theory .",
    "if life were a movie , physical reality would be the entire dvd : future and past frames exist just as much as the present one .",

    "as it is clear from the definitions given above , space - time has no ` points ' .",
    "space - time has been defined as an aggregation of _ events_. it is an emergent relational property of all changing things .",
    "the manifold , which is certainly a mathematical concept , _ represents _ space - time , and the elements of the manifold represent events .",
    "i do not subscribe that space - time is a _ thing _ , as the sustantivalists do ( e.g. nerlich 1994 ) .",
    "i hold that space - time is an emergent relational property of all material things .",
    "this is the very same position maintained by bunge ( 1977 ) and developed by perez - bergliaffa et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , among others .",
    "the ` portrait ' is the manifold model , the ` subject ' , space - time , and space - time emerges from changing things .",
    "so , the ontological assumption of the manifold model of space - time is that there are changing things , something that bunge probably will not deny .",
    "but space - time itself can not change , unless we accept a multidimensional time , with the extra dimensions not included in space - time ( see arguments against multidimensional time in bunge 1958 ) .",
    "the emergence of space - time from changing basic things is also essential to the foundations of background - independent quantum gravity ( e.g. rovelli 2004 ) .",
    "if things relate discontinuously , then space - time itself should display quantum features .",
    "another argument used by bunge is :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ... the notion that time is just one more geometric dimension , on a par with the other three ( or seven ) , is false as well , as shown by the privileged role it holds in the equations of motion .",

    "time _ is not _ on a par with the other dimensions , since the space - time metric is represented by a tensor field of trace @xmath13 , not 4 .",
    "the manifold is locally lorentzian , not euclidean , hence it represents correctly the distinctive role of time .",
    "a mere ` spatialization ' of time is inconsistent with our current knowledge of nature .",
    "inconsistencies , moreover , can be found in the presentism advocated by bunge : in a universe with a finite and constant velocity for the propagation of interactions , simultaneity is not absolute as in a newtonian space ( einstein 1905 ) and past and future of events not causally connected are relative to a reference system .",
    "this does not mean that some events exist with respect to one system and not to other .",
    "the constraints on what can be known from some physical reference frame are epistemological , not ontological .",
    "existence is invariant under general coordinate transformation .",
    "the events that we call ` future ' are as real as those we call ` past ' ( see , e.g. , putnam 1967 ) .    regarding boundary conditions , their temporal counterparts are the so - called initial conditions .",
    "actual boundary conditions in space - time should be fixed in 4 dimensions in order to make predictions .",
    "we should not confuse the predictive power of our theories , with ontological determinism .",
    "the latter is a metaphysical doctrine : the doctrine that all events exist , independently of our possibility of knowing or predicting them .",
    "the manifold model of space - time is ontologically deterministic , although it is compatible with epistemic indeterminacy",
    ".    it might be the case that the manifold model of space - time be ultimately incorrect .",
