    "the internal disorder of quantum - mechanical non - relativistic systems is conditioned by the spatial spreading of their schrdinger single - particle probability density @xmath0 to a great extent . to quantify it , various single and composite information - theoretic measures",
    "@xcite have been proposed beyond the familiar ordinary moments @xmath1 of @xmath0 , @xmath2 and the statistical variance @xmath3 = \\left\\langle r^2 \\right\\rangle - \\left\\langle r \\right\\rangle^2\\ ] ] among the single information - theoretic measures it is worth highlighting the fisher information @xcite @xmath4:= \\int_\\omega \\frac{\\left [ \\bar{\\nabla}\\rho ( \\vec{r } ) \\right]^2 } { \\rho(\\vec{r } ) } d\\vec{r}\\ ] ] and the shannon entropy @xcite @xmath5:=   \\int_\\omega \\rho ( \\vec{r } )   \\log \\rho(\\vec{r } ) d\\vec{r}\\ ] ] and its generalization , the entropic moments @xmath6 : = \\int_\\omega \\left[\\rho(\\vec{r})\\right]^q d\\vec{r};\\quad q\\in \\mathbb{r}\\ ] ] or its modified forms known as renyi and tsallis entropies .",
    "the ( translationally invariant ) fisher information @xmath7 $ ] , contrary to the shannon , renyi and tsallis entropies , is a local measure of spreading of the density @xmath0 because it is a gradient functional of @xmath0 . the higher this quantity is , the more localized is the density , the smaller is the uncertainty and the higher is the accuracy in estimating the localization of the particle .",
    "in contrast , the shannon , renyi and tsallis entropies are global measures of delocalization because they are logarithmic and power functionals of @xmath0 .",
    "they measure the total extent of the density in various complementary ways , without any reference to any specific point of the domain of definition of @xmath0 .",
    "the latter should be realized when comparing these three entropies with the variance @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "these single information - theoretic measures have been shown to be very fertile in numerous scientific , technological and financial fields , particularly to identify , characterize and interpret numerous atomic and molecular phenomena such as e.g. , correlation properties in atoms , spectral avoided crossings of atoms in external fields and the transition state and the other stationary points in chemical reactions .",
    "recently , some information - theoretic measures composed by two of the aforementioned single measures have been shown to be most appropriate to grasp the different facets of the internal disorder of quantum systems and to disentangle among their rich three - dimensional geometries .",
    "this is basically because ( i ) they are invariant under replication , translation and scaling transformations , and ( ii ) they have minimal values for both extreme cases : the completely ordered systems ( e.g. a dirac delta distribution and a perfect crystal in one and three dimensions ) and the totally disordered systems ( e.g. , an uniform or highly flat distribution and an ideal gas in one and three dimensions ) .",
    "the latter property shows that these two - ingredient complexity measures quantify how easily a system may be modelled .",
    "these composite quantities are the lmc shape complexity @xmath9 $ ] which is defined @xcite as @xmath10 = d[\\rho ] \\times \\exp \\left ( s[\\rho]\\right),\\ ] ] the fisher - shannon complexity @xmath11 $ ] , defined in @xcite by @xmath12 = f[\\rho ] \\times j[\\rho]\\ ] ] and the cramr - rao complexity @xcite , given by @xmath13 = f[\\rho]\\times v[\\rho]\\ ] ] where @xmath14=w_2[\\rho]$ ] is the second - order entropic moment , heretoforth called disequilibrium because it quantifies the departure of @xmath0 from equilibrium , and @xmath15 $ ] is the shannon entropy power defined by @xmath16=\\frac{1}{2\\pi e}\\exp \\left(\\frac{2}{3 } s[\\rho]\\right)\\ ] ] for the three - dimensional systems .",
    "we note that the lmc shape complexity measures the combined effect of the average height and the total spreading of the density , while the fisher - shannon complexity grasps the oscillatory nature of the density together with its total extent in the configuration space , and the cramr - rao quantity takes into account the gradient content of the density jointly with its concentration around the centroid .",
    "it is worth noting that these complexity measures are lower - bounded @xcite as @xmath17\\ge 1,\\qquad   c_{\\text{fs}}[\\rho]\\ge 3\\qquad \\text{and } \\qquad c_{\\text{cr}}[\\rho]\\ge 9\\ ] ] for general three - dimensional systems .",
    "here we first survey the information theory of quantum systems subject to central potentials and then we apply it to hydrogenic systems .",
    "finally some applications to relativistic and multidimensional systems are shown to illustrate the predictive power of the theory .",
    "the quantum stationary states of a single - particle system in a spherically - symmetric potential @xmath18 are known to be described by the wave functions @xmath19 with the quantum numbers @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "the angular part is given by the spherical harmonics @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and @xmath26 denotes the familiar gegenbauer or ultraspherical polynomials .",
    "the radial part @xmath27 is given by an orthogonal hypergeometric function ( i.e. , it has the form @xmath28 , where @xmath29 denotes a system of polynomials orthogonal with respect to the weight function @xmath30 ) or any other special function of applied mathematics .",
    "then the probability to find the particle between @xmath31 and @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 where the volume element @xmath34 , and the radial and angular probability densities are given by @xmath35 ^ 2\\ ] ] and @xmath36 ^ 2 \\left [ \\sin \\theta \\right]^{2m}\\ ] ] respectively .",
    "the former density gives the probability per radial interval to find the particle in @xmath37 , and the latter one describes the spatial profile of the system .",
    "the information theory allows us to calculate the intrinsic randomness ( uncertainty ) and the profile of the system by means of various information - theoretic measures ( already defined ) of the radial and angular probability densities , respectively . beyond the variance , which is given by @xmath38=\\int_{0}^{\\infty } r^4 \\omega_l(r ) \\left[y_n(r ) \\right]^2 dr - \\left| \\int_{0}^{\\infty }   r^3 \\omega_l(r ) \\left[y_n(r ) \\right]^2 dr \\right|^2,\\ ] ] the fisher information can be expressed by @xmath39=f[y_n]+ \\langle r^{-2 } \\rangle f[y_{lm}],\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is equal to the norm of the orthogonal polynomials @xmath41 involved in the wavefunction , and @xmath42 $ ] and @xmath43 $ ] are the fisher functionals of the polynomial @xmath41 and the spherical harmonics @xmath44 , respectively .",

    "we need to specify the analytic form of the central potential .",
    "this is done for hydrogenic systems , which have a coulomb potential , in the following section .",
    "for a central potential of coulombian form , i.e. @xmath49 , the quantum stationary states of a hydrogenic system have the energies @xmath50 and the probability density ( [ eq : probdens ] ) @xmath51 given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 ^ 2\\ ] ] with @xmath54 and @xmath55 . taking into account this fact and realizing that @xmath41 are the laguerre polynomials",
