    "many real networks are dynamic structures in which connections appear , disappear , or are rewired on various timescales @xcite . for example , the links representing social relationships in social networks @xcite are a static representation of a succession of contact or communication events , which are constantly created or terminated between pairs of individuals ( actors ) .",
    "such temporal evolution is an intrinsic feature of many natural and artificial networks , and can have profound consequences for the dynamical processes taking place upon them . until recently",
    "however , a large majority of studies about complex networks have focused on a static or aggregated representation , in which all the links that appeared at least once coexist .",
    "this is the case , for example , in the seminal works on scientific collaboration networks @xcite , or on movie costarring networks @xcite . in particular ,",
    "dynamical processes have mainly been studied on static complex networks @xcite .    in recent years , the interest towards the temporal dimension of the network description has blossomed .",
    "empirical analyses have revealed rich and complex patterns of dynamic evolution @xcite , pointing out the need to characterize and model them @xcite . at the same time , researchers have started to study how the temporal evolution of the network substrate impacts the behavior of dynamical processes such as epidemic spreading @xcite , synchronization @xcite , percolation @xcite and social consensus @xcite .    here , we focus on the dynamics of a random walker exploring a temporal network @xcite .",
    "the random walk is indeed the simplest diffusion model , and its dynamics provides fundamental hints to understand the whole class of diffusive processes on networks .",
    "moreover , it has relevant applications in such contexts as spreading dynamics ( i.e. virus or opinion spreading ) and searching .",
    "for instance , assuming that each vertex knows only about the information stored in each of its nearest neighbors , the most naive economical strategy is the random walk search , in which the source vertex sends one message to a randomly selected nearest neighbor @xcite .",
    "if that vertex has the information requested , it retrieves it ; otherwise , it sends a message to one of its nearest neighbors , until the message arrives to its finally target destination .",
    "thus , the random walk represents a lower bound on the effects of searching in the absence of any information in the network , apart form the purely local information about the contacts at a given instant of time .    in our study",
    ", we consider as typical examples of temporal networks the dynamical sequences of contact between individuals in various social contexts , as recorded by the sociopatterns project @xcite .",
    "these datasets contain indeed the time - resolved patterns of face - to - face co - presence of individuals in settings such as conferences , with high temporal resolution : for each contact between individuals , the starting and ending times are registered by the measuring infrastructure , giving access to the timing _ and _ duration of contacts .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec [ sec : overv - rand - walks ] we review some of the fundamental results for random walks on static networks . in sec .",
    "[ sec : real - dynam - netw ] we describe the empirical dynamical networks considered : we recall some basic definitions , present an analysis of the datasets , and introduce suitable randomization procedures , which will help later on to pinpoint the role of the correlations in the real data . in sec .",
    "[ sec : rand - walks - empir ] we write down mean - field equations for the case of maximally randomized dynamical contact networks , and in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical - simulations ] we investigate the random walk dynamics numerically , focusing on the exploration properties and on the mean first passage times . sec .",
    "[ sec : random - walks - finite ] is devoted to the analysis of the impact of the finite temporal duration of real time series .",
    "finally , we summarize our results and comment on some perspectives in sec [ sec : disc - concl ] .",
    "the random walk ( rw ) process is defined by a walker that , located on a given vertex @xmath0 at time @xmath1 , hops to a nearest neighbor vertex @xmath2 at time @xmath3 .    in binary networks , defined by the adjacency matrix @xmath4 such that @xmath5 is @xmath2 is a neighbor of @xmath0 , and @xmath6 else , the transition probability at each time step from @xmath0 to @xmath2 is @xmath7",
    "where @xmath8 is the degree of vertex @xmath0 : the walker hops to a nearest neighbor of @xmath0 , chosen uniformly at random among the @xmath9 neighbors , hence with probability @xmath10 ( note that we consider here undirected networks with @xmath11 , but the process can be considered as well on directed networks ) . in weighted networks with a weight matrix @xmath12 , the transition probability takes instead the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the strength of vertex @xmath0 @xcite . here",
    "the walker chooses a nearest neighbor with probability proportional to the weight of the corresponding connecting edge .",
    "the basic quantity characterizing random walks in networks is the _ occupation probability _ @xmath15 , defined as the steady state probability ( i.e. , measured in the infinite time limit ) that the walker occupies the vertex @xmath0 , or in other words , the steady state probability that the walker will land on vertex @xmath0 after a jump from any other vertex .",
    "following rigorous master equation arguments , it is possible to show that the occupation probability takes the form @xcite @xmath16 respectively in binary and weighted networks .",
    "other characteristic properties of the random walk , relevant to the properties of searching in networks , are the _",
    "mean first - passage time _ ( mfpt ) @xmath17 and the _ coverage _",
    "@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the mfpt of a node @xmath0 is defined as the average time taken by the random walker to arrive for the first time at @xmath0 , starting from a random initial position in the network .",
    "this definition gives the number of messages that have to be exchanged , on average , in order to find vertex @xmath0 .",
    "the coverage @xmath18 , on the other hand , is defined as the number of different vertices that have been visited by the walker at time @xmath1 , averaged for different random walks starting from different sources .",
    "the coverage can thus be interpreted as the searching efficiency of the network , measuring the number of different individuals that can be reached from an arbitrary origin in a given number of time steps .    at a mean - field level , these quantities are computed as follows : let us define @xmath19 as the probability for the walker to arrive for the first time at vertex @xmath0 in @xmath1 time steps . since in the steady state @xmath0 is reached in a jump with probability @xmath15 , we have @xmath20^{t-1 } \\rho_i$ ] .",

    "the reachability takes the form @xmath24^t",
    "\\simeq 1-\\exp(-t \\rho_i),\\ ] ] where the last expression is valid in the limit of sufficiently small @xmath15 .",
    "the coverage of a random walk at time @xmath1 will thus be given by the sum of these probabilities , i.e. @xmath25 for sufficiently small @xmath26 , the exponential in eq .",
    "can be expanded to yield @xmath27 , a linear coverage implying that at the initial stages of the walk , a different vertex is visited at each time step , independently of the network properties @xcite .",
    "it is now important to note that the random walk process has been defined here in a way such that the walker performs a move and changes node at each time step , potentially exploring a new node : except in the pathological case of a random walk starting on an isolated node , the walker has always a way to move out of the node it occupies . in the context of temporal networks ,",
    "on the other hand , the walker might arrive at a node @xmath0 that at the successive time step becomes isolated , and therefore has to remain trapped on that node until a new link involving @xmath0 occurs . in order to compare in a meaningful way random walk processes on static and dynamical networks , and on different dynamical networks , we consider in each dynamical network the average probability @xmath28 that a node has at least one link .",
    "the walker is then expected to move on average once every @xmath29 time steps , so that we will consider the properties of the random walk process on dynamical networks as a function of the rescaled time @xmath30 .",
    "dynamical or temporal networks @xcite are properly represented in terms of a _ contact sequence _ , representing the contacts ( edges ) as a function of time : a set of triplets @xmath31 where @xmath0 and @xmath2 are interacting at time @xmath1 , with @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the total duration of the contact sequence .",
    "the contact sequence can thus be expressed in terms of a _",
    "characteristic function _ ( or temporal adjacency matrix @xcite ) @xmath34 , taking the value @xmath35 when actors @xmath0 and @xmath2 are connected at time @xmath1 , and zero otherwise .    coarse - grained information about the structure of dynamical networks can be obtained by projecting them onto aggregated static networks , either binary or weighted .",
    "the binary projected network informs of the total number of contacts of any given actor , while its weighted version carries additional information on the total time spent in interactions by each actor @xcite .",
    "the aggregated binary network is defined by an adjacency matrix of the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the heaviside theta function defined by @xmath38 if @xmath39 and @xmath40 if @xmath41 . in this representation ,",
    "the degree of vertex @xmath0 , @xmath42 , represents the number of different agents with whom agent @xmath0 has interacted . the associated weighted network , on the other hand ,",
    "has weights of the form @xmath43 here , @xmath12 represents the number of interactions between agents @xmath0 and @xmath2 , normalized by its maximum possible value , i. e. the total duration of the contact sequence @xmath33 .",
    "the strength of vertex @xmath0 , @xmath44 , represents the average number of interactions of agent @xmath0 at each time step .    while static projections represent a first step in the understanding of the properties of dynamical networks , they coarse - grain a great deal of information from the empirical time series , a fact that can be particularly relevant when considering dynamical processes running on top of dynamical networks @xcite . at a basic topological level ,",
    "projected networks disregard the fact that dynamics on temporal networks are in general restricted to follow _ time respecting paths _",
    "@xcite , meaning that if a contact between vertices @xmath0 and @xmath2 took place at times @xmath45 , it can not be used in the course of a dynamical processes at any time @xmath46 . therefore ,",
    "not all the network is available for propagating a dynamics that starts at any given node , but only those nodes belonging to its set of influence @xcite , defined as the set of nodes that can be reached from a given one , following time respecting paths .",
    "moreover , an important role can also be played by the bursty nature of dynamical and social processes , where the appearance and disappearance of links do not follow a poisson processes , but show instead long tails in the distribution of link presence and absence durations , as well as long range correlations in the times of successive link occurrences @xcite .",
    "the temporal networks used in the present study describe the sequences of face - to - face contact between individuals recorded by the sociopatterns collaboration @xcite : in the deployments of the sociopatterns infrastructure , each individual wears a badge equipped with an active radio - frequency identification ( rfid ) device .",
    "these devices engage in bidirectional radio - communication at very low power when they are close enough , and relay the information about the proximity of other devices to rfid readers installed in the environment .",
    "the devices properties are tuned so that face - to - face proximity ( 1 - 2 meters ) of individuals wearing the tags on their chests can be assessed with a temporal resolution of @xmath47 seconds ( @xmath48 seconds represents thus the elementary time interval that can be considered ) .",
    "we consider here datasets describing the face - to - face proximity of individuals gathered in several different social contexts : the european semantic web conference ( `` eswc '' ) , the hypertext conference ( `` ht '' ) , the 25th chaos communication congress ( `` 25c3 '' ) , and a primary school ( `` school '' ) . a description of the corresponding contexts and various analyses of the corresponding datasets can be found in refs  @xcite .    in table  [",

    "[ sec : overv - rand - walks ] for the case of contact sequences are hampered by the presence of time correlations between contacts .",

    "a remark is in order for the 25c3 conference . a close inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig : covextended ] shows that the rw does not reach the whole network in any of the extensions schemes , with @xmath81 , although the duration of the simulation is quite long @xmath82 .",

    "the 25c3 dataset shows , as discussed above , a considerable slowing down , with a very slow decay in time .",
    "interestingly , the school dataset is much faster than all the rest , with a decay of the residual coverage @xmath88 exhibiting an approximate exponential decay .",
    "it is noteworthy that the plots for the randomized sran sequence do not always obey the mean - field prediction ( see lower plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : residual ] ) . this deviation can be attributed to the fact that sran extensions preserve the topological structure of the projected weighted network , and it is known that , in some instances , random walks on weighted networks can deviate from the mean - field predictions @xcite .",
    "these deviations are particularly strong in the case of the 25c3 dataset , where connections with a very small weight are present .",

( predicting that @xmath17 is inversely proportional to @xmath84 ) , for every dataset considered ; on the other hand , random walks on the extended sequence srep yield at the same time deviations from the mean - field prediction and much stronger fluctuations around an average behavior .",
    "figure [ fig : mpft - rp ] addresses this case in more detail , showing that the data corresponding to rw on different datasets collapse on an average behavior that can be fitted by a scaling function of the form @xmath94 with an exponent @xmath92 .",
    "these results show that the mfpt , similarly to the coverage , is rather insensitive to the distribution of the contact durations , as long as the distribution of cumulated contact durations between individuals is preserved ( the weights of the links in the projected network ) .",
    "therefore , the deviations of the results obtained with the srep extension of the empirical sequences have their origin in the burstiness of the contact patterns , as determined by the temporal correlations between consecutive conversations .",
    "the exponent @xmath95 means that the searching process in the empirical , correlated , network is slower than in the randomized versions , in agreement with the smaller coverage observed in fig .",

    "[ fig : mpft - rp ] for the srep case leads to two noticeable conclusions .",

    "second , the mfpt at a node is largely determined by its strength .",
    "this can indeed seem counterintuitive as the strength is an aggregated quantity ( that may include contact events occurring at late times ) .",
    "however , it can be rationalized by observing that a large strength means a large number of contacts and therefore a large probability to be reached by the random walker . moreover , the fact that the strength of a node is an aggregate view of contact events that do not occur homogeneously for all nodes but in a bursty fashion leads to strong fluctuations around the average behavior , which implies that nodes with the same strength can also have rather different mfpt ( note the logarithmic scale on the y - axis ) .",

    "differences in the coverage @xmath112 will then depend on the intrinsic properties of the dynamic network . for a static network indeed , either binary or weighted , the coverage @xmath112 would be independent of @xmath0 , as random walkers on static networks lose the memory of their initial position in a few steps , reaching very fast the steady state behavior eq . .",

    "the inset shows the same data on a linear scale , to emphasize the deviation from mean - field .",
    "[ fig : reach - s ] , scaledwidth=49.0% ]    another interesting quantity is the probability that a vertex @xmath0 is discovered by the random walker . as discussed in section [ sec : overv - rand - walks ] , at the mean field level the probability that a node @xmath0 is visited by the rw at any time less than or equal to @xmath1 ( the random walk reachability ) takes the form @xmath115 $ ] .",

    "interestingly , the simple rescaling by @xmath28 and @xmath118 leads to an approximate data collapse for the rw processes on the various dynamical networks , showing a very robust behavior . similarly to the case of the mfpt on extended sequences , the dynamical property @xmath113 can be in part `` predicted '' by an aggregate quantity such as @xmath84 .",
    "strong deviations from the mean - field prediction of eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob_reach ] ) are however observed , with a tendency of @xmath113 to saturate at large strengths to values much smaller than the ones obtained on a static network .",
    "thus , although the set of sources of almost every node @xmath0 has size @xmath49 , as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : empirical - data ] ( i.e. , there exists a time respecting path between almost every possible starting point of the rw processes and every target node @xmath0 ) , the probability for node @xmath0 to be effectively reached by a rw is far from being equal to @xmath35 .    moreover , rather strong fluctuations of @xmath113 at given @xmath84 are also observed : @xmath84 is indeed an aggregate view of contacts which are typically inhomogeneous in time , with bursty behaviors randomized according to the sran procedure instead , eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob_reach ] ) is well obeyed and only small fluctuations of @xmath113 are observed at a fixed @xmath84 ( not shown ) . ] .",
    "figure [ fig : reach - s-2 ] also shows that the reachability computed at shorter time ( here @xmath119 ) displays stronger fluctuations as a function of the strength @xmath84 computed on the whole time sequence : @xmath113 for shorter rw is naturally less correlated with an aggregate view which takes into account a more global behavior of @xmath0 .     to be reached by a rw of length @xmath119 , @xmath113 , and the rescaled strength @xmath120 for different datasets , where @xmath84 is computed on the whole dataset of length @xmath33 .",
    "the inset shows the same data on a linear scale .",
    "[ fig : reach - s-2 ] , scaledwidth=42.0% ]",
    "in this paper we have investigated the behavior of random walks on temporal networks . in particular ,",
    "we have focused on real face - to - face contact networks concerning four different datasets .",
    "these dynamical networks exhibit heterogeneous and bursty behavior , indicated by the long tailed distributions for the lengths and strength of conversations , as well as for the gaps separating successive interactions .",
    "we have underlined the importance of considering not only the existence of time preserving paths between pairs of nodes , but also their temporal duration : shortest paths can take much longer than fastest paths , while fastest paths can correspond to many more hops than shortest paths .",
    "interestingly , the appropriate rescaling of these quantities identifies universal behaviors shared across the four datasets .",
    "given the finite life - time of each network , we have considered as substrate for the random walk process the replicated sequences in which the same time series of contact patterns is indefinitely repeated . at the same time , we have proposed two different randomization procedures to investigate the effects of correlations in the real dataset .",
    "the  sequence randomization \" ( sran ) destroys any temporal correlation by randomizing the time ordering of the sequence .",
    "this allows to write down exact mean - field equations for the random walker exploring these networks , which turn out to be substantially equivalent to the ones describing the exploration of the weighted projected network .",
    "the  statistically extended sequence \" ( sstat ) , on the other hand , selects random conversations from the original sequence , thus preserving the statistical properties of the original time series , with the exception of the distribution of time gaps between consecutive conversations .",
    "we have performed numerical analysis both for the coverage and the mfpt properties of the random walker . in both cases",
    "we have found that the empirical sequences deviate systematically from the mean field prediction , inducing a slowing down of the network exploration and of the mfpt .",
    "remarkably , the analysis of the randomized sequences has allowed us to point out that this is due _ uniquely _ to the temporal correlations between consecutive conversations present in the data , and _ not _ to the heterogeneity of their lengths .",
    "finally , we have addressed the role of the finite size of the empirical networks , which turns out to prevent a full exploration of the random walker , though differences exist across the four considered cases . in this context , we have also shown that different starting nodes provide on average different coverages of the networks , at odds to what happens in static graphs . in the same way",
    ", the probability that the node @xmath0 is reached by the rw at any time in the contact sequence exhibits a common behavior across the different time series , but it is not described by the mean - field predictions for the aggregated network , which predict a faster process .    in conclusion ,",
    "the contribution of our analysis is two - fold . on the one hand",
    ", we have proposed a general way to study dynamical processes on temporally evolving networks , by the introduction of randomized benchmarks and the definition of appropriate quantities that characterize the network dynamics . on the other hand , for the specific , yet fundamental , case of the random walk ,",
    "we have obtained detailed results that clarify the observed dynamics , and that will represent a reference for the understanding of more complex diffusive dynamics occurring on dynamic networks .",
    "our investigations also open interesting directions for future work .",
    "for instance , it would be interesting to investigate how random walks starting from different nodes explore first their own neighborhood @xcite , which might lead to hints about the definition of `` temporal communities '' ( see e.g. @xcite for an algorithm using rw on static networks for the detection of static communities ) ; various measures of nodes centrality have also been defined in temporal networks @xcite , but their computation is rather heavy , and rw processes might present interesting alternatives , similarly to the case of static networks @xcite .",
