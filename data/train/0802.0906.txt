    "ice of water plays many important roles in the protoplanetary disk .",
    "first , ice enhances the opacity and affects the disk structure ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "second , ice enhances the amount of solid material in the disk , which promotes the formation of protoplanets and the core of gaseous planets ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "third , ice evaporation in the inner region of the disk may cause the isotopic anomaly of oxygen found in meteorites @xcite .",
    "fourth , icy planetesimals or comets may bring water on the earth @xcite as well as the innermost part of the disk @xcite . to discuss these issues in detail , we need the spatial distribution of ice in the disk .",
    "therefore , we should resolve the ice condensation / sublimation front , so - called `` snow line '' , in the disk .",
    "ice is found ubiquitously in the molecular cloud and the circumstellar envelope through the prominent 3  absorption feature ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in two edge - on protoplanetary disks ,",
    "the 3  ice absorption feature is clearly detected by spectroscopy with the subaru telescope @xcite .",
    "however , we can not resolve the `` snow line '' along the line of sight with this method .",
    "observations with the infrared space observatory found 44 and 62  ice emission feature in some protoplanetary disks @xcite . however , very low spatial resolution of the far - infrared instrument prevents us from resolving the `` snow line '' , either .    on the other hand , the scattered light from edge - on protoplanetary disks",
    "have already been detected well in the optical to the mid - infrared by very high - resolution imaging with the hubble space telescope and ground - based 8-m telescopes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the scattered light from debris disks have also been detected in the optical to the near - infrared ( nir ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , @xcite suggest that the existence of icy grains is a possible cause of the observed reddening of the optical scattered light beyond @xmath4 au in the debris disk of @xmath5 pictoris .",
    "however , @xcite argue that the photosputtering by ultraviolet photons results in the ice erosion in optically thin disks . to resolve this issue",
    ", we should seek a direct evidence of the ice if it exists .",
    "the most important merit of the scattered light observations is the ability to reveal the detailed surface structure of the disks . indeed , coronagraphic imaging with the subaru telescope has detected the scattered light from face - on disks in the nir and revealed the surface structure @xcite .",
    "if an evidence of ice is imprinted in the scattered light , we can resolve the distribution of ice , i.e. `` snow line '' , with the scattered light . in section 2 ,",
    "we first show that the h@xmath0o ice absorption feature at 3  is clearly imprinted in the scattered light spectrum , and then , we present a few diagnostics diagrams to check the existence of ice as well as a typical grain size . in section 3 , we discuss the observational feasibility of the icy grains with the scattered light . the final section is a summary of this paper .",
    "we consider the radiation transfer of only the light scattered by the circumstellar disk .",
    "that is , we consider a wavelength where the thermal radiation from the disk is negligible .",
    "let us consider a ray toward an observer as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "we set an optical depth coordinate @xmath6 on the ray . for simplicity , we assume that the disk has a clear `` surface '' . in other words , there is no matter in the outside of the disk .",
    "we set the total optical depth of the disk along the ray at the frequency @xmath7 as @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the optical depth coordinate has @xmath9 and @xmath10 at the two `` surfaces '' of the far and the near sides from the observer , respectively ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "note that the optical depth @xmath11 with the absorption and scattering cross sections per unit gas mass @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , and the gas mass column density along the ray @xmath14 .",
    "we will assume a typical mass abundance of dust relative to gas based on the elemental abundance of the sun later .",
    "the scattering albedo @xmath15 .",
    "the `` surface '' of the real circumstellar disks can be defined by various ways ; the photosphere of the dust emission , the scale height of the material distribution , and the layer at which the optical depth against the stellar radiation becomes unity .",
    "for the context of this paper , the last two definitions could be realistic for optically thin and thick disks , respectively .",
    "however , we here assume a simpler `` surface '' in which all the materials are confined . this assumption might be too simple , but we can highlight the relevant physics clearly .",
    "in addition , the results from this assumption excellently agree with those from more complicated numerical simulations as shown below .",
    "the observable intensity without the incident radiation along the ray is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the scattering source function along the ray at the optical depth coordinate @xmath6 shown in fig .  1 .",
    "we consider a point p(@xmath18 $ ] ) in the disk ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "assuming the isotropic scattering for simplicity , we have @xmath19 ) = \\omega_\\nu j^*_\\nu(r , z ) + \\omega_\\nu j_\\nu(t)\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the mean intensity of the stellar radiation ; @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the planck function with the stellar effective temperature @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the solid angle of the stellar photosphere from the point p , and @xmath25 is the optical depth between the stellar photosphere and the point p. the solid angle is @xmath26 with the stellar radius @xmath27 and the visible fraction of the stellar photosphere from the point p @xmath28 . if we consider a ray almost face - on and assume a disk geometrically thin , the solid angle @xmath24 can be regarded as constant ; @xmath29 . the second term in eq .",
    "( 2 ) is due to the multiple scattering in the disk ; @xmath30 is the mean intensity of the scattered radiation at the point p.    in the optically thin disk , we can consider @xmath31 and can neglect the multiple scattering ; @xmath32 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath33 which can be regarded as constant along the ray if @xmath24 is approximated to be constant . in this case",
    ", we can integrate eq .",
    "( 1 ) easily , and we have @xmath34 where we have applied the condition @xmath35 of an optically thin disk .    for the optically thick disk , we can consider @xmath36 , where @xmath5 is so - called grazing angle ; the angle between the incident radiation and the disk surface ( see fig .  1 ) . generally , @xmath5 is as small as about 0.05 radian .",
    "although @xmath5 increases along the radial distance @xmath37 from the central star in a flaring disk , we expect @xmath38 radian even at @xmath39 au @xcite . for a single scattering case , we have @xmath40 where @xmath41 is defined in eq .  ( 4 ) . in this case",
    ", we can integrate eq .",
    "( 1 ) with the assumption of constant @xmath5 and @xmath42 , then , @xmath43 where we have applied the condition @xmath44 of an optically thick disk .",
    "however , the multiple scattering could be important for the optically thick disk . according to the `` law of diffuse reflection '' by semi - infinite plane - parallel medium @xcite ,",
    "this effect is accounted for by the @xmath45-function ; @xmath46 where @xmath47 is cosine of the reflection angle from the normal of the slab .",
    "we have adopted an approximation with @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( i.e. almost face - on ) . ] where @xmath50 is the flux density incident on the plane - parallel slab with the angle from the normal whose cosine is @xmath51 .",
    "note that @xmath52 , @xmath53 as eq .",
    "( 4 ) , and @xmath54 . ]",
    "finally , we have the observable intensity toward the face - on direction as follows : @xmath55 note that @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the scattering optical depth of the disk .",
    "therefore , we can observe the dust feature via the albedo @xmath58 or the scattering cross section @xmath13 ( or @xmath57 ) in the scattered light from circumstellar disks .    in fig .  2",
    ", we show the scattering albedos and cross sections of silicate and silicate+ice dust as a function of the wavelength in the nir for some cases of the grain size .",
    "the optical properties are taken from @xcite ; astronomical silicate @xcite and crystalline h@xmath0o ice @xcite .",
    "we calculated the absorption and scattering coefficients of the two species independently by the mie theory @xcite with the mass abundances relative to gas of @xmath59 and @xmath60 and with the material density of @xmath61 g @xmath62 and @xmath63 g @xmath62 @xcite , then , we added them . even if we calculated the coefficients as ice - coated silicate or silicate - ice mixture , the presence of the h@xmath0o ice features would not be affected qualitatively @xcite .",
    "as shown in fig .  2 , we expect in general a steeper spectral slope ( i.e. bluer color ) as a smaller dust grain size because @xmath58 and @xmath13 of smaller grains have a strong wavelength dependence .",
    "since @xmath58 and @xmath13 are almost independent of the wavelength , i.e. gray scattering , for @xmath64  grains , the spectral slope is expected to be very similar to that of the rayleigh - jeans law in the nir . in the case with h@xmath0o ice , a strong absorption feature of h@xmath0o",
    "ice appears in the albedo at 3  and other features , for example , of 2  and 4.5 , are also found , but weaker ( panel [ b ] ) .",
    "the 3  o - h stretching mode also shows the typical resonance feature in the scattering cross section ( panel [ d ] ) .",
    "the strength of the feature seems to decrease as the dust grain size increases although it does not disappear even in the 10  case .",
    "3 shows the expected spectra of the brightness of an annulus with silicate and h@xmath0o ice ; the panel ( a ) is the optically thick case and the panel ( b ) is the thin case .",
    "we have assumed the dust size of 1.0 , the radius of the annulus of 100 au , and a central a - type star ( @xmath65 k and @xmath66 ) .",
    "the gas surface density of the annulus is assumed to be @xmath67 g @xmath68 ( e.g. , @xcite ) and @xmath69 g @xmath68 for the thick and the thin cases , respectively .",
    "the grazing angle @xmath70 and the visible fraction of the stellar photosphere @xmath71 are also assumed .",
    "the geometry between the observer and the annulus is face - on .    the solid curves in fig .",
    "3 are calculated by eq .",
    "( 9 ) . for the optically thick case",
    ", we need the @xmath45-function . here",
    "we adopt an approximate expression of it by @xcite rather than the original one whose evaluation needs an iterative calculation ; @xmath72 the dotted curves are results from numerical simulations ; 1 + 1d radiative transfer calculation with the variable eddington factor method developed by @xcite but extended by us to treat the isotropic scattering ( inoue , nakamoto , oka in preparation ) .",
    "we show the spectra of the single annulus same as the solid curves . in the calculation",
    ", we kept @xmath70 but iteratively solved the vertical hydrostatic equilibrium in the annulus for the central stellar mass @xmath73 to be consistent with the temperature structure from the radiative equilibrium .",
    "as shown in the both panels of fig .  3 , we find excellent agreements between the simple analytic models of eq .",
    "( 9 ) and the numerical simulations .    in the nir around the 3  h@xmath0o ice absorption feature",
    ", the stellar spectrum can be expressed by the rayleigh - jeans law .",
    "thus , as an approximation , the scattered spectra may be given by @xmath74 which are shown as the dashed curves in fig .",
    "3 ( see also eq .  13 ) .",
    "indeed , we find that this approximation is good enough to discuss just if the 3  h@xmath0o ice feature is observable or not .",
    "hereafter , we use this simple expression as the scattered spectra .",
    "4 shows two photometric colors expected as a function of the dust grain size : ( a ) and ( b ) for @xmath2 , and ( c ) and ( d ) for @xmath75 . we have assumed a usual set of the filter transmission functions of @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "this choice of the bands is not definitive .",
    "we could choose any two bands shortward and longward of @xmath1 band .",
    "the @xmath1 band transmission function is assumed to be a rectangular between 3.02 and 3.16 .",
    "the magnitude zero points are taken from @xcite for @xmath76 and @xmath77 . for @xmath1 , we assume @xmath78 jy at @xmath79   based on fig .  2 in @xcite .",
    "four disk models , optically thick disk with silicate ( open circles ) , optically thick disk with silicate and ice ( filled diamonds ) , optically thin disk with silicate ( open triangles ) , and optically thin disk with silicate and ice ( filled squares ) , are shown in the panels .",
    "the dotted lines indicate the rayleigh - jeans law .",
    "the scattered light colors without h@xmath0o ice ( open circles and triangles ) are bluer than the rayleigh - jeans law for a small ( @xmath80 ) dust size . ]",
    "and they approach the rayleigh - jeans color as the dust size increases .",
    "the observational fact that most of the scattered light from the disks are not bluer than the stellar color indicates a large ( @xmath64 ) dust size ( but au mic ; @xcite ) .",
    "if the dust includes h@xmath0o ice ( filled diamonds and squares ) , significant differences appear ; for optically thick disks with ice ( diamonds ) , @xmath2 is much bluer than that without ice and @xmath75 is much redder than that without ice , because of the prominent absorption in @xmath1 band .",
    "note that @xmath2 becomes blue even if a large ( @xmath64 ) dust size which makes gray scattering in @xmath3 .",
    "thus , we can conclude that there is h@xmath0o icy dust with a large size if we observe neutral @xmath3 and blue @xmath2 colors . on the other hand",
    ", we can conclude that there is h@xmath0o ice only if we observe red @xmath75 because the red color is not produced without h@xmath0o ice .    for optically thin disks with ice ( squares ) ,",
    "@xmath2 starts from the rayleigh - jeans color ( i.e. much redder color than that without ice ) and becomes gradually bluer as grain size becomes larger .",
    "@xmath75 oppositely starts from a very blue color and becomes gradually redder as grain size becomes larger .",
    "such behaviors are caused by the resonance feature in @xmath1 band seen in the scattering cross section ( fig .",
    "2 [ d ] ) .",
    "interestingly , these differences caused by the feature in @xmath1 band enable us to classify disk and dust properties on a two color diagram , for example @xmath2 and @xmath3 , as shown in fig .",
    "5 . in this figure",
    ", we find four sequences : the optically thick disk with silicate ( open circles ) , the optically thick disk with silicate and ice ( filled diamonds ) , the optically thin disk with silicate ( open triangles ) , and the optically thin disk with silicate and ice ( filled squares ) .",
    "each sequence consists of five points corresponding to the grain sizes of 0.1 , 0.3 , 1.0 , 3.0 , and 10 .",
    "the large asterisk indicates the location expected from the rayleigh - jeans law . in fig .  5",
    ", we find five classifications :    a : : :    optically thick and thin disks with small ( @xmath80 )    silicate dust b : : :    optically thick and thin disks with large ( @xmath64 )    silicate dust c : : :    optically thick disks with small ( @xmath80 ) silicate    and ice dust d : : :    optically thick and thin disks with large ( @xmath64 )    silicate and ice dust e : : :    optically thin disks with small ( @xmath80 ) silicate    and ice dust    if we observe a disk through 3 bands , @xmath76 , @xmath1 , and @xmath77 , then , we plot the data on the two color diagram , we can judge if the disk is optically thick or thin , the grain size is smaller or larger than about 1 , and the dust includes ice or not .",
    "importantly , if we plot spatially resolved data on the diagram , we can derive the dust properties at each position on the disk .",
    "that is , we can derive the spatially resolved `` snow line '' by this method .",
    "k ) at the disk inner edge is also scattered toward the observer as well as the stellar radiation .",
    "this component may make a fraction of the nir scattered radiation from the disks .",
    "this effect could be taken into account by modulating the incident spectrum which has been assumed to be a planck function ( for example in eq .",
    "note that the modulation of the incident spectrum results in only the change of the reference color .",
    "in other words , we could use figs .  4 and 5 even for such a case if we take a preferable reference color rather than the rayleigh - jeans law .",
    "]    before moving the next section , we briefly comment on the effect of the anisotropic scattering . if the grain size is enough large relative to the wavelength , the scattering becomes a forward scattering not isotropic . in terms of the asymmetry parameter @xmath81 with the scattering angle @xmath82",
    ", the nir photons are scattered with @xmath83 by a 1   silicate or h@xmath0o ice grain . in this case",
    ", we expect that the disk image in the scattered radiation shows asymmetry ; if we observe an inclined disk , the near side becomes brighter by the forward scattering and the other side becomes fainter by an inefficient back scattering . on the other hand",
    ", the 3  h@xmath0o ice feature may not be affected by the forward scattering because the asymmetry parameter does not show a large variation around the feature .",
    "h@xmath0o ice condenses on the surface of the dust grains / aggregates if the temperature of the dust surface is low enough ( 100200 k depending on the gas density ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we estimate the ice existence region in optically thin disks and on the `` surface '' of optically thick disks . for optically thick disks , only their `` surface ''",
    "is interesting because we can not observe the scattered stellar radiation from the optically thick interior .",
    "when the disk height @xmath84 , the temperature ( @xmath85 ) at the `` surface '' of optically thick disks or in optically thin disks is approximated to @xmath86 ) d\\nu    \\approx \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{r_*}{r}\\right)^2     \\int_0^\\infty \\kappa_\\nu^{\\rm a } b_\\nu(t _ * ) d\\nu\\,,\\ ] ] where we have neglected self - absorption of the disk radiation .",
    "the dust temperature calculated from equation ( 12 ) is roughly proportional to @xmath87 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the absolute value of the temperature depends on the dust composition and size as well as the central stellar luminosity",
    ". however , an order of estimate would be enough here .",
    "when we assume the stellar effective temperature of 10,000 k and the stellar radius of 2.5 @xmath88 for an a - type ( herbig ae / be ) star , and 3,000 k and 2.0 @xmath88 for a k - type ( t tauri ) star , we find that the dust temperature becomes well below of 100 k if @xmath89 au for the a - type case and @xmath90 au for the k - type case , implying the presence of `` snow line '' around that radius .    in order to resolve the disk radius of 10100 au at 100 pc away from us , we need to detect the disk scattered light as close as 0.11.0 arcsec to the central star . at the same time",
    ", we must avoid the central stellar radiation to detect an image of the surrounding very faint scattered light from the disk . around 3",
    "( i.e. h@xmath0o feature ) , a coronagraphic instrument with an adaptive optics on a 8-m telescope such as ciao ( coronagraphic imager with adaptive optics ) on the 8.2 m subaru telescope enables us to detect the disk scattered light as close as about 0.75 arcsec @xcite .",
    "it is still too large to resolve the expected radius of the `` snow line '' for the k - type ( t tauri ) case ( @xmath91 arcsec ) , but is small enough to resolve the `` snow line '' for the a - type ( herbig ) case ( @xmath92 arcsec ) .",
    "thus , we have a chance to detect the `` snow line '' on the disk around an a - type star with the scattered light .",
    "an approximated form of the equation ( 9 ) is @xmath93 where we have assumed the rayleigh - jeans law , the visible fraction @xmath71 , and the @xmath45-function @xmath94 .",
    "the spectra of the brightness calculated by this equation are shown as the dashed curves in fig .  3 ; the good agreements ensure the validity of this approximated equation .    we expect to detect the scattered light even in @xmath77-band ( 3.8 ) from optically thick ( i.e. protoplanetary ) disks easily if the observing instrument can resolve the disks at @xmath89 au with occulting the central star by a coronagraph .",
    "for example , we expect that the nir brightness at 100 au of an optically thick disk around an a - type star is about 12 mag arcsec@xmath95 for a scattering albedo @xmath96 ( the dust size of @xmath64 ; see fig .  2 ) and a grazing angle @xmath70 .",
    "this is consistent with the observations of herbig ae disks ( 1113 mag arcsec@xmath95 ; e.g. , @xcite ) . even for the case of a k - type star ,",
    "the expected brightness at 100 au is about 14 mag arcsec@xmath95 for @xmath97 and @xmath70 .",
    "this is also consistent with the observations of t tauri disks ( 1416 mag arcsec@xmath95 ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such brightness would be easily detected with a coronagraphic instrument on a 8-m telescope . in order to clarify",
    "if ice exists on the surface of the disk , we need to achieve @xmath98 mag ( see fig .  4 [ c ] )",
    ". this would not be difficult because the sensitivity at 3  is usually better than that at @xmath77-band .",
    "for an optically thin ( i.e. debris ) disk , we assume the scattering optical depth of @xmath99 which is based on the dust mass estimation in debris disks with the scuba @xcite . in this case , the expected nir brightness at 100 au of the disk is about 16 mag arcsec@xmath95 for an a - type star .",
    "this is consistent with the observations of debris disks ( 1516 mag arcsec@xmath95 ; e.g. , @xcite ) . for a k - type star ,",
    "the expected brightness is about 18 mag arcsec@xmath95 , which is also consistent with that of au mic @xcite .",
    "thus , detecting debris disks in @xmath77 band may not be easy with ground - based telescopes even for an a - type star case . with a space instrument ,",
    "the spatial resolution is the matter rather than the sensitivity .",
    "we have proposed a new method for obtaining the spatially resolved `` snow line '' in the circumstellar disks ; observing 3  h@xmath0o ice feature in the scattered light . based on radiative transfer considerations ,",
    "we show that the frequency dependence of the scattered light comes from the frequency dependence of the albedo for optically thick disks and of the scattering cross section for optically thin disks .",
    "since 3  h@xmath0o ice feature is clearly imprinted in the albedo and the scattering cross section , we expect to find the feature in the scattered light easily .",
    "then , we have proposed a diagnostics of disk dust properties by near - infrared three bands ( @xmath76 , @xmath1 , and @xmath77 ) photometry ; on the @xmath2 and @xmath3 two color diagram , we can distinguish that the disk is optically thick or thin , typical grain size is small or large , and ice exists or not .",
    "finally , we have confirmed the scattered light and the h@xmath0o ice feature from protoplanetary disks are detectable and spatially resolvable with a current coronagraphic instrument on 8-m telescopes .",
