    "at certain conditions , the critical state of a type - ii superconductor may become unstable @xcite , then thermomagnetic avalanche may develop . during the thermomagnetic avalanche , temperature of the superconducting sample increases rapidly and large amount of the magnetic flux enters into the sample volume .",
    "thermomagnetic avalanches , called flux jumps , are problematic from a viewpoint of practical applications of superconductors , because they may drive a superconducting sample into a normal or , at least , into a resistive state .",
    "the stability of critical state depends strongly on a relation between the thermal ( @xmath3 ) and magnetic ( @xmath4 ) diffusivity .",

    "such conditions are called `` locally adiabatic '' .",
    "the most commonly studied parameter , which determines the stability of the critical state is a field of the first ( after cooling the sample in zero magnetic field ) flux jump , @xmath15 .",
    "this parameter is closely correlated with the critical penetration depth , @xmath16 .",
    "if the critical current density , @xmath17 , does not depend on the magnetic field , @xmath18 .",
    "this parameter is very important from a viewpoint of the practical applications of the superconductors , because it is possible to avoid the thermomagnetic avalanches , if the width of the superconducting sample is smaller than @xmath19 .",
    "we can also express the condition of the stability of the critical state in a form : @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the field of full penetration , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is half - width of the investigated sample . in the simplest approximations ,",
    "the sample is usually assumed to be of a shape of an infinite slab , of width @xmath24 , and an external magnetic field is applied parallel to its surface . in locally adiabatic conditions ,",
    "the field of the first flux jump can be expressed by a formula    @xmath25    the thermal parameter , which determines the critical state stability in locally adiabatic conditions , is the specific heat @xmath7 . in locally adiabatic conditions ,",
    "the stability of the critical state is not influenced by the cooling conditions at the surface of the superconducting sample .",
    "the situation is different in a case when @xmath26 .",
    "such conditions usually occur in superconducting composites and are called `` dynamic '' . in dynamic conditions , the thermal parameter which determines the stability of the critical state is the thermal conductivity , @xmath6 , or the thermal boundary conductivity , @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "some problems connected with the critical state stability in high temperature superconductors ( htsc ) are not clarified yet .",
    "the problems are connected with the complex structure of these materials .",
    "the analysis of the critical state stability in htsc is usually performed within approximations developed for conventional superconductors @xcite , which sometimes lead to wrong results .",
    "because of the increasing number of applications of htsc , it is very important to understand all aspects of the thermomagnetic avalanche development in these materials .",
    "one of the specific features of htsc is their strong crystallographic anisotropy .",
    "experimental data show that high temperature superconductors are usually more stable against flux jumping than conventional superconductors .",
    "the larger stability of the high temperature superconductors against flux jumping can be correlated with the flux creep phenomenon , which is usually strong in these materials @xcite . in studies of the magnetization of superconductors ,",
    "flux creep manifests itself as a relaxation of the magnetic moment .",
    "the process of magnetic relaxation reflects strongly nonlinear current - voltage characteristics of superconducting sample .",
    "these characteristics can be approximated by the formula    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the voltage criterion at which the critical current density , @xmath17 , is defined , and @xmath30 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "one usually assumes @xmath31 v / m . in this case @xmath32 .",
    "the influence of nonlinear current - voltage characteristics on the critical state stability , in the case of a weakly cooled sample ( for @xmath33 , @xmath34 is so - called biot number ) , was analyzed in ref.@xcite .",
    "it was shown that in such conditions the critical state stability depends on the external magnetic sweep rate,@xmath35 .",

    "it is extremely difficult to obtain thick crystals of bi@xmath37sr@xmath37cacu@xmath37o@xmath38 , and we have shown @xcite that the thickness of the crystal strongly influences the critical state stability . on the other hand ,",
    "it is relatively easy to obtain large cubic samples of la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 .",
    "for this reason , we have chosen this system to study the influence of crystal anisotropy on the critical state stability .",

    "we paid special attention to the dynamics of the flux jumps , which remains poorly understood up to date .",
    "this dynamics is also important from a viewpoint of superconductor applications , because a large power of the heat released during short avalanches may , at certain conditions , lead to the destruction of superconducting devices . in the present work , we also studied the dynamics of the magnetic flux changes in a single crystal of la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2  during thermomagnetic avalanches . in particular",
    ", we focused on the influence of external magnetic field on dynamics of the following stages of the thermomagnetic avalanche .",

    ", we used the quantum design ppms system with the extraction magnetometer option and the maximal external magnetic field attainable of 9 tesla .",
    "after cooling the sample in zero magnetic field , external magnetic field was swept with constant rate from 0 to 9  t. in the following experiments , we varied the sweep rate from the minimal ( @xmath40 t / s ) to the maximal ( @xmath41 t / s ) one attainable in our system .",
    "the distance between the following data points taken in each magnetization curve was limited by the sweep rate and the time needed to take each data point . at the maximal sweep rate ( @xmath41 t / s ) , we were not able to obtain the distance smaller than about 0.1 t. this distance has limited an accuracy of @xmath15 , determined in our experiments .    in order to determine the current - voltage characteristics of our sample , we performed studies of magnetic moment relaxation .",
    "after cooling in zero external magnetic field , external magnetic field was first swept , with minimal sweep rate , up to 0.5 t , and next the relaxation of magnetic moment was registered at constant external magnetic field during approximately 1 hour .",
    "the studies of @xmath15 , as well as of magnetic relaxation , were performed both for external magnetic field parallel to the @xmath42-axis and for external magnetic field parallel to the @xmath43-plane .",
    "the dynamics of the flux jumps was studied in the cryogenics 12 tesla magnet system with variable temperature insert for external magnetic field parallel to the @xmath42-axis . a pick - up coil consisted of 6 turns of copper wire wound around the investigated sample and connected to data acquisition board ( daq ) in the computer .",
    "because of small inductance of the applied coil and large internal resistance of daq , we were able to register the changes of the voltage with time resolution better that 10@xmath44  s. the time resolution of daq was about 10@xmath45  s. we registered time dependence of the coil voltage during the following flux jumps .",
    "additionally , we used two miniature hall probes to register magnetic field dependence of the surface self - field , @xmath46 , of the investigated sample .",
    "one of the probes was put in the centre of the surface of the investigated sample . the second probe measured external magnetic field .",
    "the differential signal from the two probes was proportional to @xmath46 .",
    "the cryogenic hall probes were made from tin doped insb films .",
    "the probe was supplied with the current of 10 ma .",
    "the sensitivity of the hall probe was about 5 mv / t .",
    "the rate of external magnetic field sweep was approximately 1 t / min .",
    "in the 12 tesla magnet system , we also performed magnetization measurements using vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm ) .",
    "it is important to note that the heat exchange conditions in both systems used in our experiments were very different . in the ppms system ,",
    "the sample was put into a standard ppms holder , which was surrounded by helium gas with low pressure ( about 0.5 torr ) . in the 12 tesla magnet system , during the experiments at 2 k and 4.2 k , the sample was immersed in liquid helium . during experiments at higher temperatures ,",

    "nevertheless , in all our ppms experiments , we were able to determine the value of @xmath15 .",
    "temperature range of the flux jumps occurence depends on the sample orientation .",
    "for the external magnetic field parallel to the @xmath42-axis , flux jumps occur even at 9.5 k ( see fig .",

    "no jumps were present at the temperature of 4.2 k or at higher temperatures .    in figure 3b and 3c ,",
    "one can see time dependence of the voltage per one turn of the coil wounded around the investigated sample , registered during the succeeding flux jumps .",
    "the numbers at the curves correspond to the numbers denoting successive flux jumps presented in fig .",

    "the voltage of the coil is proportional to the time derivative of the magnetic flux in the investigated sample .",
    "we can recognize two characteristic stages of the flux jump . during the first stage , the rate of the magnetic flux changes increases . during the second stage , the rate of the magnetic flux changes decreases .",
    "we have denoted duration of these two stages as @xmath47 ( `` before maximum '' ) and @xmath48 ( `` after maximum '' ) , respectively ( see fig .",
    "we have determined duration of the following stages of the flux jump at a noise level , which in our system was about 30 mv .",
    "one can see that the voltage of the observed impulses for the ascending branch of the hysteresis loop ( fig .",

    "2 ) of about 40 and 30 for the external magnetic field parallel to the @xmath43-plane and parallel to the @xmath42-axis , respectively . in the range of the flux jumps occurrence ,",
    "the @xmath30-parameter was only weakly dependent on temperature .",
    "hence , we did not consider this dependence in our further analysis .",
    "the temperature dependence of the critical current density was estimated using the widths of the magnetization hysteresis loops in the external magnetic field of 1 t , which was close to the field of the first flux jump , and the formulas from ref .",
    "we used here the loops taken by vsm in 12 tesla magnet system . in vsm system , we did not observe any flux jumps neither at 4.2 k nor at higher temperatures , and there was no limitation of the signal above 20 emu like in ppms extraction magnetometer .",
    "limitation of the signal as well as a large number of the flux jumps observed in ppms experiments made determination of the critical current density ( using ppms data ) impossible .",
    "the experimentally obtained temperature dependence of the critical current density was fitted according to the exponential formula : @xmath54 , where @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath5735.5  k. we have found the following fitting parameters . for the external magnetic field parallel to the @xmath42-axis , @xmath58 a/@xmath52 and @xmath59  =  7.4  k ( the critical current density in the direction parallel to the @xmath43-plane ) . for the external magnetic field parallel to the @xmath43-plane ,",

    "we have found that the approximation of the weakly cooled sample can not be applied in the case of our sample immersed in liquid helium ( in this case @xmath75 10 ) .",

    "we assumed the dynamic model for the weakly cooled sample ( @xmath73 ) to describe the critical state stability in the case of our experiments performed in ppms .",

    "6 ) at the begin and at the end of the flux jump . during the flux jumps observed in our experiment ,",
    "the sample was wholly penetrated by the magnetic flux ( see fig .",
    "hence , as a characteristic length of the diffusion process ( in eq .",
    "6 ) , at the end of the flux jump , we assumed the parameter @xmath23 , it means half of the sample width . on the other hand , at the begin of the flux jump , only a part of the sample is penetrated by the magnetic flux .",
    "hence at this stage , one should assume the characteristic length parameter to be equal to the penetration depth , which is smaller than @xmath23 .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the parameter @xmath4 for the begin of the flux jump , we have found to be similar as that for the end of the jump .",
    "these two parameters coincide very well , if we assume in eq .  6  @xmath106 ( see fig .",
    "5b ) for the begin of the flux jump .    the characteristic diffusivity found in our experiment was of an order of 1 @xmath52/s ( see fig .",
    "such an order of diffusivity is characteristic for the magnetic diffusion in our system , providing the sample is in the normal state or in the flux flow regime .",
    "the resistivity of la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2  is anisotropic .",
    "however , we studied dynamics of the flux jumps only for the external magnetic field parallel to the @xmath42-axis of the investigated crystal . in such sample orientation , screening currents flow only in the @xmath43-plane .",
    "if we assume the in - plane normal state resistivity @xmath107 @xcite , then @xmath108 . on the other hand , if one takes data of the thermal conductivity ( @xmath6 ) @xcite and of the specific heat ( @xmath7 ) @xcite , one can estimate the in - plane thermal diffusivity ( @xmath109 ) to be of an order of @xmath110 .",
    "the out - of - plane thermal diffusivity is approximately one order of magnitude lower than the in - plane thermal diffusivity @xcite .",
    "the critical state stability in a single crystalline la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2  is influenced by a large number of parameters .",
    "all of them must be considered in order to determine the critical state stability in the framework of existing theoretical models . in la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2  crystal ,",
    "most of these parameters are anisotropic .",
    "hence , the stability of the critical state depends strongly on the sample orientation with respect to the external magnetic field .    in our analysis",
    ", we consider both anisotropy of critical current density and the anisotropy of the current - voltage characteristic ( the anisotropy of the @xmath30-parameter ) . in the present analysis",
    ", we assumed the thermal conductivity of the investigated sample to be limited only by the in - plane thermal conductivity , which is approximately one order of magnitude higher that the out - of - plane thermal conductivity . according to our results in the case of la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2  crystal ,",
    "the anisotropy of the @xmath30-parameter is relatively weak .",
    "hence , the anisotropy of the critical state stability is connected mainly with the anisotropy of screening currents .",
    "the difference between the in - plane and out - of - plane screening current , at given temperature , is about one order of magnitude .    in both sample orientations",
    "studied in our experiments , the thermomagnetic avalanche develops in dynamic conditions .",
    "our sample is characterized by a strong flux creep phenomenon .",
    "hence , the critical state stability is influenced both by the external magnetic field sweep rate and the cooling conditions .",
    "these cooling conditions were very different in two cryostats used in our experiments .    in ppms experiments , where the sample is surrounded by helium gas of low pressure",
    ", the critical state stability can be analyzed in the approximation of weak cooling or low biot number . in such condition ,",
    "the thermal parameter that influences the critical state stability is the thermal boundary conductivity .",
    "this parameter is difficult to determine experimentally .",
    "it depends e.g. on the roughness of the surface of the investigated sample . in the case of ppms experiments ,",
    "the investigated sample is put additionally into a holder which makes an analysis of the heat exchange conditions even more difficult .",
    "nevertheless , it seems to be slightly surprising that , according to our analysis , the thermal boundary conductivity changes by an order of magnitude after the change of the sample orientation .",
    "it is possible that such results are , to some extent , connected with the approximations assumed by the models used in our analysis . in our analysis",
    "we used models of an isotropic infinite slab sample . in order to determine ( in the framework of these models ) the critical state stability criterion ,",
    "it is necessary to know a large number of parameters .",
    "each of these parameters must be determined experimentally and all parameters have some experimental errors . as the result",
    ", the uncertainty of the obtained critical state stability criterion can be relatively large .",
    "the models used in our analysis can be applied only for some limiting cases ( @xmath73 or @xmath74 ) . in order to determine the critical state stability in an intermediate case , numerical calculations are necessary .",
    "such calculations were performed e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in order to determine the current - voltage characteristics , we study the relaxation of the magnetic moment .",
    "although eq .",
    "2 can be applied to describe the the current - voltage characteristics in a wide range of the electric field , one must bear in mind that the electric field induced in the superconducting sample during magnetic relaxation experiments is significantly lower than the electric field induced by the external magnetic field sweep .",
    "one should also bear in mind that the accuracy of determination of @xmath15 for the highest sweep rate ( @xmath41 t ) in our experiment was only about @xmath111 t. this experimental error has a special significance for the sample orientation with the external magnetic field parallel to the @xmath43-plane , because for this orientation all observed values of @xmath15 were in the range between 0.5 t and 1 t ( see fig .",
    "2 ) .    finally ,",
    "more accurate analysis of the critical state stability in an anisotropic material should also take into account the value of the out - of - plane thermal conductivity .    our experimental results , as well as the data for textured ybacuo @xcite ,",
    "show that by the improvement of the cooling conditions , i.e. by immersing the sample in liquid helium , the critical state stability increases significantly .",
    "both dynamic models used in our analysis predict the dependence of @xmath15 on the external magnetic sweep rate ( see eq . 3 and eq . 5 ) .",
    "these equations were derived assuming the critical current density to be independent on the magnetic field and predict this dependence to be described by a power function with the power of @xmath112  and @xmath113   for the approximation of weak cooling and the isothermal approximation , respectively . however ,",
    "if the critical current density is strongly dependent on the magnetic field , the dependence of @xmath15 on the sweep rate can be modified @xcite .",
    "the comparison of the predictions of eq .  3 with the experimental results",
    ", one can see in fig .  2 and in fig .",
    "one can observe the largest inconsistency for the lowest temperatures and for the external magnetic field parallel to the @xmath43-plane .    the influence of the heat exchange conditions on critical state stability as well as a strong dependence of @xmath15 on the sweep rate show that thermomagnetic instabilities are initiated in dynamic conditions , in which the magnetic diffusivity is smaller than the thermal one .",
    "on the other hand , the effective diffusivity describing the dynamics of the flux jumps ( see fig .",
    "5b ) is very high , it means comparable to the magnetic diffusivity in the normal state .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of this effective diffusivity suggests that it can be correlated with the flux flow resistivity . in order to understand this discrepancy",
    ", one should explain that the initial stage of the avalanche develops at the voltage level that is induced by the external magnetic field sweep .",
    "we estimate that the sweep rates used in our experiments induced in the coil the voltage of an order of @xmath114 v , which is six or four orders of the magnitude lower than the noise level registered by the acquisition board . for this reason",
    ", we were not able to register this very initial stage of the avalanche .",
    "our experimental results show that after this initial stage of the avalanche the resistivity of the sample rapidly increases and the dynamics of the flux jumps is governed by the magnetic diffusivity , which depends of the flux flow resistivity .",
    "the stability of the critical state in a large crystal of la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2  is influenced by its anisotropy , and it depends on the sample orientation with respect to the external magnetic field .",
    "the most relevant is the anisotropy of the critical current . at relatively slow magnetic field sweep rates ,",
    "thermomagnetic avalanches are initiated in the dynamic conditions .",
    "hence , one observes a strong influence of the heat exchange conditions as well as of the sweep rate on the critical state stability . in the case of the experiments , where the investigated sample is surrounded by helium gas with low pressure ( ppms ) ,",
    "the critical state stability criterion can be derived in the approximation of a weakly cooled sample . however , this approximation can not be applied in the case of large crystals immersed in liquid helium .",
    "flux jumps in the single crystalline la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2  are very short , typical duration is of several microseconds .",
    "the dynamics of the jumps is governed by the magnetic diffusivity , proportional to the flux flow resistivity .",
