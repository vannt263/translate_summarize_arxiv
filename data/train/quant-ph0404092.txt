    "quantum computation has emerged as one of the prime source of inspiration for mathematical quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "it is a information processing based on quantum state belonging to a @xmath0 group .",
    "typically , spin one - half is considered as a natural playground . but any two level system can be utilized . in a separate development ,",
    "@xmath0 structure has been uncovered @xcite in one dimensional system with generalized point interaction @xcite .",
    "a natural question is whether it can be used for quantum information processing .",
    "the purpose of this article is to show that that is indeed possible with the help of background potential , which move the particle back and forth while keeping the wave function profile .",
    "we consider controlling that motion by manipulating the properties of the barrier which separate the two spacial regions of the system .",
    "this quantum barrier is nothing but the point interaction whose characteristics is specified by @xmath0 .",
    "when we identify the wave function localized at each of the two separated regions as qubits @xmath1 and @xmath2 , this @xmath0 actually corresponds to the relevant operation of quantum computation .",
    "the resulting model system takes the appearance of the quantum version of that ancient eastern calculational device of _",
    "we argue that this model could be a prototype of a robust quantum qubit device which excels in stability , controllability and scalability .",
    "we consider a one dimensional system of quantum particle moving on @xmath3 axis subjected to a harmonic oscillator potential of frequency @xmath4 and the inverse square potential with the strength @xmath5 ; @xmath6 with @xmath7 , the background potential is reduced to the elementary harmonic oscillator . in this article",
    ", we shall mainly work with this simple limit .",
    "then , we further add the generalized point interaction placed at the origin whose characteristics are controllable .",
    "we define boundary vector at @xmath8 and @xmath9 as @xmath10 the point interaction is described by an element @xmath11 of unitary group @xmath0 , that specifies the value of the boundary vector such that @xmath12 in other word , all point interactions allowable in quantum mechanics form a family described by the set of four parameters , whose manifold structure is given by @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the elementary example of @xmath14-interaction is but a very special one parameter family within this wider class of interactions .",
    "in fact , generalized point interaction @xmath0 comprises such exotic interactions that cause discontinuity in the wave function itself , and also the ones that have constant transmission probability which is independent of the particle energy .",
    "the background harmonic potential and point interaction placed at the origin as a barrier separating right and left regions.,width=226 ]    explicit construction of these highly singular point interactions has been achieved in terms of singular short - range limits of known interactions @xcite . here",
    ", we only illustrate some of the prominent examples . the identity matrix @xmath15 results in @xmath16 , signifying the inpenetrable barrier at @xmath17 with neumann boundary at its both side .",
    "similarly , the negative ofidentity matrix @xmath18 results in @xmath19 , another inpenetrable wall with dirichlet boundary .",
    "curiously , it is @xmath20 that results in barrier - less free oscillater , in @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "an inportant example is the case of hadamard matrix @xmath23 @xmath24 .",
    "it turns out that this point interaction lets the particle with all energy transmit by probability one - half .",
    "our central assertion is that the parametric @xmath0 describing the whole family of quantum point interaction can be turned into a _",
    "hilbert space _ @xmath0 _ of particle states _ in the following manner : if we identify the state localized at one side ( let s say , right side ) as qubit @xmath1 and the other side as @xmath2 , after half - period @xmath25 , arbitrary state @xmath26 is turrned into @xmath27 .",
    "essential first step for the proof is the decomposition of @xmath28 into the spectral torus @xmath29 and the isospectral sphere @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the decomposition is realized , in terms of an element @xmath11 @xmath31 as @xmath32 where @xmath33 the range of the parameters are given by @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the parameter space @xmath37 forms a torus and @xmath38 a sphere .",
    "the latter is to be indentified with the bloch sphere in quantum computation terminology .",
    "a noteworthy feature of the system is that the energy levels are decided solely @xmath39 and changing @xmath40 will keep the spectra .",

    "@xmath65 represents the closed gate , while @xmath20 is the open gate case in which they are interchanged in the period @xmath25 . with hadamard operator @xmath23 , the mixed states @xmath66",
    "are obtained from @xmath63 and @xmath64 . in all cases ,",
    "the profile of the wave function is kept .",
    ", width=245 ]",
    "now , we look at @xmath39 which is the point interaction belonging to the torus @xmath67 . the effect of @xmath39 on a qubit is applying a conditional phase whose value depends on whether the qubit is @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath68 this is nothing but two non - communicating sub - systems separated by impenetrable barrier .",
    "it is sufficient to consider only one side , say , @xmath55 side , since the structure of the problem is the same .",
    "we take out the index @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath70 for @xmath71 , one has neumann boundary , and @xmath72 so the wave function stays the same ( modulo ground state oscillation @xmath73 ) . for @xmath74 ,",
    "one has dirichlet boundary , and @xmath75 .",
    "so the wave function obtain phase @xmath76 after half period @xmath77 . for generic @xmath78 between @xmath79 and @xmath76",
    ", one has some `` in between '' boundary condition which results in some mixture of @xmath80 with energy @xmath81 which should be @xmath82 so , after the half period , the wave function obtain phase @xmath83 where we define @xmath84 , _ provided _ that the energy spectra of the system is _ equally spaced . _",
    "the phase @xmath85 is a quantity satisfying @xmath86 , and @xmath87 should be some monotonous increasing function .",
    "therefore , having @xmath39 applied for half - period , desired phase would be added .",
    "the problem is , that the system have only _ approximately _ equally spaced energy levels except for the case of large negative @xmath5 which is the strong attractive limit for the inverse square part of the background potential .",
    "so the strict phase operation is not always possible with the application of corresponding @xmath0 point interaction , except for the special cases .",
    "the result of @xmath39 operation , in general , is therefore corrupted by the mixing of undesired higher harmonics with random phases .",
    "however , there are simple workaround of this problem . instead of changing the wall property",
    ", we can c apply additional constant potential @xmath88 to obtain the desired phase after half period @xmath25 .",
    "another possibility is changing the harmonic oscillator frequency itself .",
    "the former method seems to be simpler and practical . as in any qubit realization ,",
    "the choice of the basis is arbitrary , and its any unitary transformation is a legitimate basis . in quantum cryptography , for example , two bases connected by the hadamard transformation is utilized .",
    "typically , spin up / down basis and right / left basis are used . in our case , that corresponds to the left / right localized basis and symmetric / antisymmetric basis .",
    "in mathematical term , the two - qubit operation comprises @xmath89 group .",
    "this is a natural extension to the @xmath0 , whose quantum wire realization has been the subject of this work .",
    "analogous realization of this @xmath89 exists in the form of `` quantum @xmath90-junction '' , a graph of four half lines whose edges are connected at single point @xcite .",
    "thus , the study of quantum graphs now carries even more urgency .",
    "a practical question in the experimental realization of our scheme is how to change the characteristics of the thin barrier representing the generalized point interaction .",
    "preferably , it is to be a quantally operating device with triggering mechanism utilizing particles of far smaller mass or energy scale compared to the particle used as the qubit carrier .",
    "once such device is constructed ( no doubt that will be done , in time ) , and if that trigger is coupled to the presence absence of the qubit carrier in neighboring device , we will have a realization of two - qubit operations such as control - not in place .",
    "this type of setup would be quite a bit more advantageous in term of scalability compared to the qubit manipulation utilizing the forced transition by external laser beam .",
    "one of the advantage of our implementation is the robustness of the qubit due to the simplicity of the setup , which is matched only by the spin implementations .",
    "in contrast , most solid - state based approaches use particle states which could easily be lost in temperature fluctuations , whose suppression can be costly and potentially inhibiting in the setup requiring large number of qubits .",
    "we hope that the model considered here could offer a basis for an alternative location based quantum device which is simple , robust and truly scalable .",
