    "the irs spectra were extracted from the ssc pipeline processed data using spice , and individual spectra of each object were coadded . a selection of the irs spectra is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the irs spectra show a wide variety of spectral shapes and clear features ( pahs in emission and silicate absorption at 9.7 @xmath0 ) can be seen in a number of objects .",
    "the irs spectra can be classified into three main categories : ( a ) smooth featureless continuum , usually associated with type-1 agn , ( b ) pah features in emission and silicate absorption , and ( c ) silicate absorption .",
    "[ spectra ]    [ nulnu ]    redshifts can be measured for a number of objects from the irs spectroscopy , and they agree with the optical spectroscopic redshifts , whenever available .",
    "they are also consistent in most cases with the photometric redshifts obtained from template fitting to the optical and irac photometry from swire @xcite .",
    "objects in our sample with pah features and starlight - dominated optical seds are interpreted as star - forming galaxies .",
    "their redshifts are in the range 0.6 @xmath6 z @xmath6 1.2 and the far - ir ( 8 - 1000 @xmath0 ) luminosities are in the range @xmath1 @xmath7 - @xmath8 @xmath9 . + some galaxies are found at higher redshifts , up to z @xmath1 2 .",

    "our sample , selected at 15 @xmath0 from the elais survey , differs in redshift range and luminosity from those in other major irs surveys ( fig .",
    "the sample selection of @xcite was based in color cuts using the spitzer 24 and 8 @xmath0 bands and one optical band ( r ) , while @xcite selected objects with very red 24 @xmath0 to r band colors .",
    "our elais - irs sample selection aims to cover all possible types of z @xmath10 1 sources selected at 15 @xmath0 , regardless of their mid - ir colors .",
    "the results show that a large fraction of the star - forming galaxies in the sample is at z @xmath1 1 , as expected from the photometric redshifts estimates , and is consistent with bright pah features ( 7.7 and 8.5 @xmath0 ) redshifted into the isocam lw3 band ( 15 @xmath0 ) . at low redshift ( z @xmath6 1 )",
    "our sample includes luminous infrared star - forming galaxies and two agn at intermediate redshifts ( 1.0 @xmath6 z @xmath6 1.8 ) we find agn , both obscured and unobscured , and star - forming galaxies , all with restframe 7 @xmath0 luminosities comparable to those in the @xcite and @xcite samples . at z @xmath10",
