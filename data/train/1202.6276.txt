    "we are interested in isolating ions extracted from the nist ebit for spectroscopic experiments.@xcite space constraints preclude the use of a multi - tesla penning trap@xcite . since compact penning traps using rare - earth magnets occupy less than 1000 @xmath3 of space , they are an attractive alternative .",
    "such compact penning traps have been used to study light ions in a liquid - nitrogen cooled apparatus@xcite and to store molecular anions in a room - temperature apparatus@xcite . for our planned experiments ,",
    "however , the trap must be operable at the high voltages necessary to capture highly charged ions .",
    "very low background gas pressure must be attainable at room temperature , and access must be provided for laser or atomic beams to interact with the stored ions . such constraints and requirements , together with known conditions favorable for ion confinement , have led us to explore non - traditional architectures which could help simplify construction .",

    "the electrical - iron endcaps help to reduce the fringing magnetic field , and their reentrant shape yokes the field towards the trap center . by redirecting the magnetic flux around the magnets to close the magnetic circuit via the trapping region , the soft - iron endcaps largely account for the strength and uniformity of the magnetic field near the trap center .    a comparison of the calculated and measured axial magnetic field is shown in fig .

    "subsequently , a much faster time - of - flight mcp detector was added in the modified set - up for the two - magnet penning trap to allow observations in the short storage - time regime , analysis of the ion charge states , and better fine - tuning of ion injection .",
    "another improvement was the use of more vacuum pumps ( not shown in fig.[fig : apparatus ] ) to obtain lower residual background gas pressure .",
    "a base pressure of @xmath74 pa was attained in the two - magnet penning trap ; based upon observed decay rates , we estimate that the ion cloud expansion time - constant is about 3 s under optimal conditions , sufficiently long for a variety of spectroscopic experiments .",
    "improvement in storage lifetime is anticipated at lower pressures , e.g. in a cryogenic apparatus .",
    "active stabilization of the ion cloud rotation to prolong ion confinement is also possible by incorporating  rotating - wall \" electrodes.@xcite    our work is motivated by efforts at nist to produce one - electron ions in circular rydberg states.@xcite other potential applications include portable mass spectrometers ( for space - borne or earth - based field instruments ) , laser spectroscopy , and studies of rydberg or metastable states in stored highly charged ions ."
