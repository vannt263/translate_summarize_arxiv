    "the detection of x - ray , optical and radio afterglows from gamma - ray burst events ( costa et al 1997 ; van paradijs et al 1997 , sahu et al 1997 ; frail et al 1997 ) and concommitant redshifts ( metzger et al 1997 ) has provided strong support for the cosmological origin of the phenomenon . the success of the fireball model ( cavallo & rees 1978 ; rees & meszaros 1992 ; meszaros & rees 1993 ) is largely independent of the origin of the energy , requiring only an energetic and baryon - poor event confined to small scales , thereby giving rise to a relativistic and optically thick outflow .",
    "these requirements alone place extreme limits on the nature of the genesis , for the energy ( @xmath0 ergs ) and scales ( @xmath1 ) , which suggest some catastrophic event associated with the birth or death of compact objects .    although these are powerful constraints , they leave sufficient leeway to provide several avenues of investigation , such as binary mergers involving neutron stars and black holes ( paczynski 1986 ; eichler et al 1989 ; paczynski 1991 ) , failed supernovae collapsing to black holes ( woosley 1993 ) , the collapse of rotating massive stellar cores ( hypernovae ) ( paczynski 1997 ) or the accretion induced collapse of white dwarfs or neutron stars in binaries ( usov 1992 ; qin et al 1998 ) .",
    "all except usov s scenario are ` prompt ' in the sense that the delay between a burst of star formation and the occurrence of such events is small relative to cosmological timescales .",
    "this holds true even for the binary inspiral scenarios , although they may possess a long - timescale tail in the delay distribution ( tutukov & yungelson 1997 ; portegies zwart & spreeuw 1996 ) .",
    "this trend has spawned investigations of the redshift distribution assuming rates derived from the recently determined cosmological star formation rates ( totani 1997 ; wijers et al 1998 ) .    in this letter",
    "we propose that many gamma ray bursts may arise from the collapse of neutron stars to black holes following stellar collisions .",
    "this scenario differs from the others mentioned above in that it is dominated by regions of high stellar density and therefore contains a significant contribution from globular clusters , an old stellar population .",
    "the collision scenario also results in a potentially significant contribution from close binaries containing helium stars , which may explain the recent association of some gamma ray bursts with type ib / c supernovae ( galama et al 1998 , wang & wheeler 1998 ) . in sections  [ scenario ]",
    "we describe the manner in which stellar collisions arise , both in globular clusters and in younger populations .",
    "section  [ rates ] provides estimates for the event rates and section  [ evol ] estimates the cosmological evolution of the gamma ray burst rate in this scenario .",
    "the salient feature of globular clusters which makes them attractive for our purpouses is the greatly enhanced probability of compact object recycling because of the large central densities and high probability of stellar interaction .",
    "the strongest empirical evidence of this is the high rate of occurrence of recycled millisecond pulsars in globular clusters , relative to the galactic disk ( e.g. taylor , manchester & lyne 1993 ) , despite the greater difficulty of detection .",
    "this is believed to result from exchanges of neutron stars into binaries or close tidal encounters between a neutron star and a main sequence star ( e.g. hut et al 1992 ) .",
    "the formation of these binaries then leads to spin - up of the neutron star due to subsequent mass transfer from the newly acquired companion .",
    "the existence of millisecond pulsars is empirical evidence that such events occur at significant rates .",
    "theoretical investigations of the cross - sections for these processes and their applications to typical cluster cores ( davies & benz 1995 ; sigurdsson & phinney 1995 ; davies & hansen 1998 ) suggest that the production of these binaries also results in merged systems ( ` smothered neutron stars ' ) at rates equal to or greater than the binary production rate .",
    "the fate of these systems is much less certain .",
    "depending on the angular momentum of the encounter , the neutron star may spiral to the center of the collision remnant or it may disrupt the star , forming a thick accretion torus ( davies et al 1992 ; rasio 1993 ) .    the limiting accretion rate onto a neutron star is considerably larger than the eddington rate because of neutrino losses ( zeldovich , ivanova & nadezhin 1972 ; chevalier 1993 ; fryer , benz & herant 1996 ) , so that the formation of such merged systems is likely to lead to rapid accretion of the disrupted companion material on approximately free - fall times for quasi - spherical remnants and global viscous transport times for disks ( chevalier 1993 ) .",
    "the rapid accretion of most of the remnant mass will lead to a collapse to a black hole .",
    "the final stages described here bear some resemblance to the gamma ray burst mechanism described by woosley ( 1993 ) ( where the accreted material was from supernova fallback ) .",
    "thus , we suggest that the production of stellar mass black holes is an inevitable consequence of the production of millisecond pulsars in globular clusters ( the essential difference in the two outcomes is the rate of accretion , the latter case being regulated by the relatively miserly donation rate of the binary companion )",
    ". the resultant rapid energy release on small scales is similar to several gamma ray burst scenarios . as we shall see , the hypothesis that such events do give rise to gamma ray bursts yields several interesting and potentially testable consequences .",
    "in particular , it represents a formation history qualitatively different from most other proposed mechanisms , as it is not tied directly to the star formation rate .",
    "younger stellar populations in galactic disks have much lower densities and thus the three body encounter rate is negligible .",
    "nevertheless , many supernova progenitors are found in binaries and the evidence is mounting that neutron stars acquire significant velocities at birth ( e.g. lyne & lorimer 1994 ; cordes , romani & lundgren 1993 ) .",
    "if the velocity is directed at a binary companion , the resulting stellar collision may produce a similar burst event .",
    "although such an occurrence is a priori unlikely , the gamma ray bursts are themselves rare events , and we shall show that this rate may be significant .",
    "if we adopt the position that such stellar collapses occur and give rise to gamma - ray bursts , we are still left with the requirement that they produce a significant rate .",
    "canonical rates for cosmological gamma - ray burst production are often based on the estimated rate of binary neutron star mergers ( phinney 1991 ; narayan , piran & shemi 1991 ) , @xmath21  event  myr@xmath3 per galaxy , and in agreement with fits to the log  n - log  p relation for nonevolving cosmological rates ( fenimore & bloom 1995 )",
    ". however , recent analyses of the latter type , using rates based on cosmological star formation histories ( as befits the prompt burst production scenarios ) , have found rates lower than this by factors of @xmath4 ( wijers et al 1998 ) to @xmath5 ( totani 1997 ) .",
    "thus any rate in the range @xmath6  myr@xmath3 per galaxy is of significance .",
    "the rate of stellar collisions increases dramatically with central cluster density , and thus the total rate will be dominated by those clusters which are undergoing the ` binary burning ' phase thought to provide support against core collapse ( e.g. goodman 1988 ) .",
    "indeed , many millisecond pulsars are found in post core - collapse clusters such as m15 or in the highest density non - collapsed clusters such as 47 tuc .",
    "burst rate estimates based on theoretical cross - sections and globular cluster evolution are model - dependent but we may obtain robust empirical estimates with the modest assumption that the burst rate is comparable to or larger than the rate of millisecond pulsar production ( see section  [ scenario ] ) . the pulsar birthrate may be estimated by considering the characteristic spin - down ages of the individual pulsars and the selection effects involved in the detections .",
    "phinney ( 1996 ) estimates density dependent production rates of @xmath7 yr@xmath3 , @xmath8 yr@xmath3 and @xmath9 yr@xmath3 in individual clusters of central luminosity density @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively .",
    "note that these refer only to currently observable pulsars and are thus almost certainly lower limits , given the steepness of the disk pulsar luminosity function and the large distances to globular clusters .",
    "phinney estimates the true rate could be @xmath4 larger .",
    "assuming @xmath13 of the globular clusters in the galaxy have sufficiently high central densities ( djorgovski & king 1986 ; chernoff & weinberg 1990 ) , this means the event rate for our galaxy can lie anywhere in the range @xmath14  myr@xmath3 .",
    "hence , relative to the new lower rates inferred by totani & wijers et al , the globular clusters are almost certainly important , and may even be important for the original non - evolving estimates .    the contribution from the galactic disk will be dominated by close binaries .",
    "the supernovae which occur in such systems appear as type ib / c at a rate @xmath15 and studies of low mass x - ray binary formation suggest pre - supernova separations of @xmath16 ( e.g. kalogera & webbink 1998 ) .",
    "assuming randomly directed kicks from the supernova , the collision rate ( for companions of approximately solar mass ) is @xmath17 in our galaxy .",
    "hence , this pathway may also be important .",
    "a gamma - ray burst history dominated by globular cluster production will provide a cosmological history qualitatively different from the currently fashionable one based on star formation rate .",
    "although the epoch of globular cluster formation is somewhat theory dependent ( see fall & rees 1988 for a review ) , globular cluster ages ( chaboyer , demarque & sarajedini 1996 ) suggest that a significant fraction of the galactic system must have existed since high redshifts .    to illustrate the cosmological history of globular cluster burst production , we have calculated the evolution of a globular cluster population assumed to have formed in a single burst 15 gyr ago .",
    "following murali & weinberg ( 1997 ) we assume 250 clusters with an initial mass distribution @xmath18 in mass range @xmath19 and spatial distribution @xmath20 in a milky - way like galaxy .",
    "individual clusters are evolved using the fokker - planck models of murali & weinberg ( 1997 ) on circular orbits in the spheroidal potential .",
    "extra heating due to eccentric orbits and the disk potential do not change the evolution qualitatively . figure  [ murali ]",
    "shows the evolution of total integrated core mass in regions of density above the threshold ( taken to be @xmath21 ) in the cluster system as a function of time .",
    "the initial rise comes from low mass clusters at small radii ( which are the dominant population and which have the shortest evolutionary timescale ) .",
    "eventually the integrated core mass drops again as the low mass clusters evaporate completely .",
    "although a galaxy globular cluster system is influenced by environment ( e.g. cluster cd galaxies such as m87 have much larger globular cluster systems ) , the number of clusters per galaxy scales roughly with luminosity within a given hubble type ( harris & racine 1979 ; vandenberg 1984 ; harris 1991 ) .",
    "thus , for the illustrative discussion below , we will adopt our above rate as a function of time per galaxy for all types ( since spirals and ellipticals have similar numbers of clusters on average ) and simply normalise to galactic luminosity densities .",
    "figure  [ npplot ] shows the @xmath22 relation from the batse 3b catalogue ( meegan et al 1996 ) for the 1024ms channel .",
    "the fit is for peak fluxes @xmath23  photons  @xmath24  s@xmath3 and assuming a single , standard candle luminosity and the cosmological history determined above .",
    "the threshold redshifts for currently favoured open and @xmath25 models ( see ostriker & steinhardt 1995 ) lie in the range 2.5 - 5 depending on the assumed spectral index , taken to be @xmath26 ( mallozzi , pendleton & paciesas 1996 ) .",
    "the derived isotropic standard candle luminosities are @xmath27 ergs . the required rate , using the estimated globular cluster comoving space density @xmath28mpc@xmath29 ( phinney 1991 ) , is then only @xmath30 per globular cluster .",
    "when this average is only taken over those undergoing core collapse , then the inferred rates are similar to the low end estimated in section  [ rates ] .",
    "the point of this simple comparison with the data is to demonstrate that globular cluster scenarios can naturally incorporate high redshift events and any significant contribution from globular clusters is likely to move the average redshifts outwards .",
    "in fact , totani ( 1997 ) finds that simple comparisons like this one but using rates based on empirical star formation laws are improved by an additional contribution from high redshifts , which he attributes to an early epoch of elliptical galaxy formation .",
    "globular cluster contributions can serve this purpouse equally well .",
    "the true rate is likely to be a combination of this one and one that does follow the star formation rate if the contribution from close helium star binaries is important . indeed , despite the very different conceptual histories , the globular cluster and star formation rates display similar redshift dependances , since both increase monotonically for several gyr and then fall away at later times .",
    "the gamma - ray burst scenario described here resembles woosley s mechanism in terms of physical processes , but contains an important difference with respect to most other cosmological gamma - ray burst models , namely a significant contribution from old stellar populations . as such",
    ", afterglow searches should be able to distinguish between this and other models by identifying host galaxies .",
    "most of the currently accepted burst models suggest that afterglows should be associated with galaxies undergoing vigorous star formation , while our scenario will produce afterglows associated with galaxies across the hubble sequence .",
    "a particularly attractive feature of the globular cluster contribution is that it provides a naturally gas - poor environment for the fireball to propagate .",
    "although the high stellar density implies that @xmath31 of material should be deposited in the cluster cores from giant star mass loss between galactic disk passages , observations indicate that globular cluster cores are remarkably gas poor ( see roberts 1988 ; knapp et al 1996 for reviews ) .",
    "typical upper limits are @xmath32 in total .",
    "iras measurements ( origlia et al 1996 ) infer warm dust masses @xmath33 ( implying gas masses @xmath4 times larger ) . furthermore , they present evidence that this is concentrated in unresolved circumstellar envelopes , so that average intracluster values are even lower . explanations range from ram pressure stripping , photoionisation ( see above reviews ) to evacuation due to the accumulated wind from millisecond pulsars ( spergel 1991 ) .",
    "thus , ambient gas masses @xmath34 on scales @xmath35pc are generic , making globular cluster cores an ideal environment for the creation of gamma ray bursts and their afterglows from fireball models .",
    "gamma ray bursts associated with post - supernova collisions in binaries may also be identifiable . while not wishing to adopt any particular model for burst evolution , we note that gamma ray bursts in these events should be associated with type ib / c supernovae ( which provide the supernova kick ) .",
    "of course , the interaction of the two related explosions is likely to cause deviations from standard light curves .    as noted by wijers et al ( 1998 ) , a significant contribution from high redshift sources is helpful in explaining the lack of observed host galaxies for some afterglows .",
    "the large redshift weighting in this scenario will make constraints from lyman limit observations ( bloom et al 1997 ) important .",
    "in addition to the possible link to gamma - ray bursts , the production of black holes described in this paper is interesting in it s own right .",
    "the presence of stellar mass black holes resulting from very massive stars ( larson 1984 ; kulkarni , hut & mcmillan 1993 ; sigurdsson & hernquist 1993 ) has profound consequences for globular cluster structure and evolution by virtue of their larger masses and greater central concentration .",
    "the black hole population we describe differs from the prior hypotheses because it is not a product of initial conditions , but rather a product of cluster evolution and stellar interaction .",
    "the final population will be determined by the competition between the production and depletion via mass segregation and dynamical ejections .",
    "elucidation of this process may allow us to place constraints on this scenario from the apparent paucity of black hole x - ray binaries in globular clusters ( int  zand et al 1998 )    in conclusion , we have proposed that the processes which produce millisecond pulsars in globular clusters also produce a significant population of stellar mass black holes and may provide the source of gamma ray bursts . in particular , the propagation of a fireball is aided by the evacuated nature of cluster cores , possibly by the millisecond pulsar winds themselves .",
    "the fact that these bursts arise from an old stellar population suggests a significant contribution from high redshifts , an assertion testable with detailed monitoring of the optical afterglows .",
    "the equivalent mechanism in younger stellar populations should lead to an association of some bursts with type ib / c supernovae .",
    "the authors would like to thank phil armitage , fred rasio and vicky kalogera for illuminating discussions and for noting the importance of the close binary contribution .",
    "brad hansen would also like to thank the aspen center for physics for their hospitality while some of this paper was written .",
