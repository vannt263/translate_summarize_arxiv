    "in recent years there has been a great deal of activity devoted to both experimental and theoretical studies of mesoscopic superconducting - normal ( @xmath0 ) hybrid structures@xcite ) .",
    "new important phenomena such as anomalous meissner screening , re - entrant behavior of the conductance , nonequilibrium - driven @xmath1-junction state and many others have been discovered and thoroughly investigated . in some cases",
    "it was found that an interplay between the proximity effect and quantum interference of electrons in a normal metal play a significant role at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "for instance , interference of electrons scattered at impurities in the normal layer may strongly enhance the andreev conductance @xmath2 of @xmath0 systems leading to the so - called zero - bias anomaly@xcite : at low voltages and temperatures @xmath3 turns out to depend linearly on the @xmath0 interface transmission @xmath4 in contrast to the standard result @xmath5 obtained in the absence of interference effects in the @xmath6-layer .",
    "in this paper we will address a different  although somewhat related  problem .",
    "we will analyze the dc josephson effect in @xmath7 systems which contain several insulating barriers . in this case",
    "electrons scattered at different barriers can interfere inside the junction .",
    "we will demonstrate that this effect may lead to qualitative modifications of the supercurrent across the junction .",
    "the most pronounced effect of quantum interference is expected in @xmath7 systems with few conducting channels .",
    "this situation can be realized , for instance , if two superconductors are connected via a carbon nanotube @xcite .",
    "more conventional @xmath7 structures with many conducting channels and several insulating barriers are also of considerable interest , for instance in relation to possible applications , see e.g. ref . and further references therein .",
    "we will demonstrate that for such systems quantum interference effects are also important provided there exist more than two scatterers inside the junction .",
    "a powerful tool for theoretical studies of mesoscopic superconductivity is provided by the quasiclassical formalism of the energy - integrated eilenberger green functions @xcite ( see also refs . for a review ) .",
    "the eilenberger equations are , on one hand , much simpler than the fully microscopic gorkov equations and , on the other hand , allow to correctly describe the system behavior at distances much longer as compared to the fermi wavelength @xmath8 . since typical length scales in superconductors ( e.g. the coherence length @xmath9 or the london penetration depth ) are all several orders of magnitude greater than @xmath8 , the quasiclassical approach is usually an excellent approximation .",
    "the quasiclassical equations can not be applied only in the vicinity of inter - metallic interfaces and barriers where rapid changes of the system properties ( at scales comparable to @xmath8 ) occur .",
    "fortunately , in many cases this problem can be circumvented by matching the eilenberger green functions on both sides of the interface with the aid of the proper boundary conditions . in order to derive such conditions",
    "it is necessary to go beyond quasiclassics , however under certain assumptions the final result can be formulated only in terms of the quasiclassical eilenberger propagators .",
    "the derivation of these boundary conditions was performed by zaitsev@xcite . supplemented by these boundary conditions ,",
    "the eilenberger quasiclassical formalism was proven to be an extremely efficient tool for a quantitative description of numerous inhomogeneous and hybrid superconducting structures .",
    "an important ingredient of the derivation@xcite is the assumption that the boundaries are situated sufficiently far from each other , so that _ interference effects _ emerging from scattering at different interfaces can be totally neglected . under this assumption one",
    "arrives at the nonlinear matching conditions involving the third power of the quasiclassical propagators .",
    "these matching conditions are expressed in terms of the interface transparency coefficients for the electrons with different directions of the fermi momenta .",
    "it is also essential that zaitsev boundary conditions do not depend on scattering phases at the interface potentials .",
    "although for metallic structures containing one interface one can indeed disregard interference effects , in systems with several boundaries this is in general not anymore possible .",
    "hence , the applicability of the nonlinear matching conditions@xcite to multiple - barrier systems requires additional analysis .",
    "some authors@xcite argued that the standard quasiclassical approach can break down in a multiple - interface geometry due to the problems with the normalization of the eilenberger functions .    in principle",
    "the above problem with boundary conditions can be avoided within the approach based on the bogolyubov - de gennes equations@xcite . however , this approach , though frequently successful , may also be technically inconvenient in complicated situations , for instance because of a necessity to evaluate the energy eigenvalues of the system and to perform summation over the energy spectrum in the final results .",
    "it is also possible to formulate an alternative quasiclassical approach@xcite which allows to avoid the abovementioned problems . without going into details here",
    "let us just mention that within the technique@xcite one deals with the quasiclassical spinor amplitude @xmath10-functions which depend on one coordinate and one time only and obey linear first order equations .",
    "the eilenberger green functions are expressed via two linearly - independent solutions of these equations in a way that both the eilenberger equations and the normalization conditions are automatically satisfied .",
    "the formalism@xcite  just as the eilenberger one  can be formulated both within the matsubara and the keldysh techniques and thus is suitable both in equilibrium and non - equilibrium situations ( see , e.g. ref . ) in various superconducting structures .",
    "it is also important that very simple _ linear _ boundary conditions for the quasiclassical amplitudes can be formulated at each of the interfaces where electron scattering takes place .",
    "the number of interfaces in the system is not restricted and the interference effects are properly taken care of . thus it is possible to take advantage of the quasiclassical approximation and at the same time to formulate general and simple boundary conditions without making additional assumptions employed in ref . .",
    "similar ideas have recently been put forward by shelankov and ozana@xcite .",
    "these authors also used linear matching conditions ( obtained by means of the scattering matrix approach ) for the `` wave functions '' which factorize the two - point green functions .",
    "the next step@xcite was to construct quasiclassical one - point green functions and formulate _ nonlinear _ boundary conditions for such functions which would now adequately include information about scattering on arbitrary number of `` knots '' .",
    "linear boundary conditions were also used by brinkman and golubov@xcite in a calculation related to ours ( see below ) .    in this paper , following refs .",
    ", we will use simple linear boundary conditions in order to match the quasiclassical amplitude functions at interfaces .",
    "however , unlike in ref . , we will avoid reformulating these boundary conditions as nonlinear ones for the eilenberger green functions .",
    "rather we will directly express the two - point green functions and the expectation value of the current operator in terms of the quasiclassical amplitudes .",
    "we will then apply our method to the calculation of dc josephson currents in hybrid @xmath11 and @xmath12 structures in the clean limit and for arbitrary interface transmission coefficients    the interference of the scattering events at different interfaces manifests itself in the expressions containing scattering phases @xmath13 at the interface potentials . for the systems with two barriers ( in our case @xmath11-systems ) with _ many transmission channels _ the summation over their contributions is equivalent to effective averaging over @xmath13 . in this limit",
    "one can demonstrate that _ after _ such averaging our result is equivalent one obtained from the eilenberger equations supplemented by the zaitsev boundary conditions .",
    "however , in the case of more than two barriers ( i.e. for @xmath12 junctions ) the dependence on the scattering phases turns out to be much more essential .",
    "in this situation the approach employing zaitsev boundary conditions turns out to fail also in the many channel limit where quantum interference effects survive even after averaging over the scattering phases .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "our quasiclassical approach is outlined in sec .",
    "ii . in sec .",
    "iii we apply this approach for the analysis of the dc josephson effect in @xmath11 structures with arbitrary interface transmissions .",
    "the josephson current across @xmath12 structures is evaluated in sec .",
    "iv . in sec .",
    "v we present a brief discussion and summary of our results .",
    "some technical details of our calculation are relegated to appendices .",
    "the starting point of our analysis are the microscopic gorkov equations@xcite . in what follows we will assume that our system is uniform along the directions parallel to the interfaces ( coordinates @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) .",
    "performing the fourier transformation of the normal @xmath16 and anomalous @xmath17 green function with respect to these coordinates @xmath18 we express the gorkov equations in the following standard form @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the matsubara frequency , and @xmath21 is the superconducting order parameter .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath22 in eq.([start ] ) reads @xmath23 here @xmath24 , @xmath25 is fermi energy , the term @xmath26 accounts for the external potentials ( including the boundary potential ) .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath27 is obtained from @xmath22 ( [ h ] ) by inverting the sign of the electron charge @xmath28 .",
    "the above hamiltonians can also include the self - energy terms which , however , will not be considered below .",
    "the quasiclassical approximation makes it possible to conveniently separate fast oscillations of the green functions due to the factor @xmath29 from the envelope of these functions changing at much longer scales as compared to the atomic ones . making use of this approximation for two - component vector @xmath30",
    "we obtain @xmath31 @xmath32 where we defined @xmath33 and @xmath34 here @xmath35 , @xmath36 represents a slowly varying part of the potential which _ does not _ include fast variations which may occur at metallic interfaces .",
    "the latter will be accounted for by the boundary conditions to be formulated below . but",
    "first let us briefly describe the general structure of the green functions obeying eq .",
    "( [ start ] ) .      consider the equation @xmath37 there exist two linearly independent solutions @xmath38 of eq .",
    "( [ appr ] ) .",
    "one such solution ( denoted below by @xmath39 ) does not diverge at @xmath40 , the other solution @xmath41 is well - behaved at @xmath42 .",
    "similarly , two linearly independent solutions @xmath43 do not diverge respectively at @xmath42 and @xmath40 .    a particular solution of the gorkov equations ( [ start ] ) can now be sought in the following form    @xmath44    and @xmath45 these functions satisfy gorkov equations at @xmath46 .",
    "the functions @xmath47 and @xmath48 are determined with the aid of the continuity condition for the green functions at @xmath49 and the condition resulting from the integration of @xmath50 in eq.([start ] ) . as a result",
    "we arrive at the linear equations @xmath51=\\left ( \\begin{array}{c } 1\\\\0\\end{array}\\right),\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can be trivially resolved .    for a homogeneous superconductor in the absence of the magnetic field",
    "this procedure allows to immediately recover the well known result @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the phase of the pairing potential , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 . here for convenience we set @xmath57 .    in a non - homogeneous situation",
    "a general solution of the gorkov equations takes the form @xmath58",
    "e^{ik_x x}+ & \\label{general } \\\\ & [ l_3(x')\\overline{\\varphi}_{-1}(x)+ l_4(x')\\overline{\\varphi}_{-2}(x)]e^{-ik_x x}.&\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for systems which consist of several metallic layers the particular solution is obtained with the aid of the procedure outlined above provided both coordinates @xmath59 and @xmath60 belong to the same layer .",
    "should @xmath59 and @xmath60 belong to different layers , the particular solution is zero because in that case the @xmath61-function in eq .",
    "( [ start ] ) fails .",
    "the functions @xmath62 in each layer should be derived from the proper boundary conditions which we will now specify .      in",
    "what follows we shall assume interfaces to be non - magnetic .",
    "in this case matching of the wave functions on the left and on the right side of a potential barrier , respectively @xmath63 and @xmath64 , is performed in a standard way ( see e.g ): @xmath65 the reflection and transmission coefficients are given by @xmath66 for the sake of simplicity below we shall set @xmath67 . since typical energies of interest , such as @xmath68 and typical matsubara frequencies , are all much smaller than the magnitude of the interface potentials , the relationships ( [ scatt ] ) can be directly applied to the two - element columns in eq .",
    "( [ general ] ) . in this way",
    "we uniquely determine the green functions of our problem .",
    "for an illustration let us consider a metallic layer with the left and right boundaries located respectively at @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "we will also choose the argument @xmath60 inside this layer . as it was already explained , the particular solution of the gorkov equations for @xmath71 or @xmath72 is @xmath73 , while it has the form ( [ xbp ] ) , ( [ xmp ] ) if the coordinate @xmath59 belongs to this layer .",
    "thus at the left boundary we get @xmath74+\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\beta_1\\left [ l_3^l ( x')\\overline{\\varphi}_{-1}^l(d_1)+ l_4^l ( x')\\overline{\\varphi}_{-2}^l ( d_1)\\right]\\label{leftb1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath75 + \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\alpha_1^ * \\left [ l_3^l ( x')\\overline{\\varphi}_{-1}^l(d_1)+ l_4^l ( x')\\overline{\\varphi}_{-2}^l ( d_1)\\right].\\label{leftb2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the superscript @xmath76 labels the solutions in the layer located at @xmath71 .",
    "the above boundary conditions provide four linear equations for the functions @xmath77 with the source term @xmath78 . similarly , with the aid of eq .",
    "( [ xbp ] ) four boundary conditions at the right boundary @xmath70 can be established .",
    "analogous procedure should be applied to other interfaces .",
    "we shall consider @xmath7 junctions composed of clean superconducting ( @xmath80 ) and normal ( @xmath6 ) metals .",
    "we will assume that a thin insulating layer ( @xmath81 ) can be present at both @xmath0 interfaces which , therefore , will be characterized by arbitrary transparencies ranging from zero to one .",
    "specular reflection at both interfaces will be assumed .",
    "we also assume that between interfaces electrons propagate ballistically and no electron - electron or electron - phonon interactions are present in the normal metal . for simplicity we will restrict our attention to the case of identical superconducting electrodes with singlet isotropic pairing .",
    "furthermore , we shall neglect possible suppression of the superconducting order parameter @xmath68 in the electrodes close to the @xmath0 interface .",
    "this is a standard approximation which is well justified in a large number of cases .",
    "the phase of the order parameter is set to be @xmath82 in the left electrode and @xmath83 in the right one .",
    "the thickness of the normal layer is denoted by @xmath84 .    in order to evaluate the dc josephson current across this structure we shall follow the quasiclassical approach described in the previous section .",
    "technical details of our calculation are presented in appendix a. as a result we arrive at the expression for the two point green function in the normal layer .",
    "after that the current density can be calculated from the standard formula @xmath85 on can also rewrite the current in the form @xmath86 where @xmath87 is defined by eq .",
    "( [ ccuu ] ) with positive matsubara frequencies @xmath88 . using ( [ str ] ) and omitting terms oscillating at atomic distances",
    "we obtain @xmath89 or explicitly @xmath90 where we defined @xmath91 here @xmath92 is the phase of the product @xmath93 .",
    "( [ j ] ) , ( [ w ] ) provide a general expression for the dc josephson current in @xmath11 structures valid for arbitrary transmissions @xmath94 and @xmath95 ranging from zero to one .",
    "this expression is the central result of this section .",
    "we also note that the integral over @xmath96 in eq .",
    "( [ j ] ) can be rewritten as a sum over independent conducting channels @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the junction cross section . in this case",
    "@xmath99 and @xmath100 may also depend on @xmath101 .",
    "this would correspond to different transmissions for different conducting channels .",
    "finally let us point out that in the limit of symmetrical low transparent barriers @xmath102 the problem was recently studied by brinkman and golubov@xcite . in the corresponding limit their result ( eq .",
    "( 8) of ref . )",
    "is similar  although not fully equivalent  to our eqs .",
    "( [ j ] ) , ( [ w ] ) .",
    "let us first analyze the above result for the case of one conducting channel @xmath103 .",
    "we observe that the first term in eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) contains @xmath104 which oscillates at distances of the order of the fermi wavelength .",
    "provided at least one of the barriers is highly transparent and/or ( for sufficiently long junctions @xmath105 ) the temperature is high @xmath106 this oscillating term is unimportant and can be neglected . however , at lower transmissions of both barriers and for relatively short junctions @xmath107 this term turns out to be of the same order as the other contributions to @xmath108 ( [ w ] ) . in this case",
    "the supercurrent is sensitive to the exact positions of the discrete energy levels inside the junction which can in turn vary considerably if @xmath84 changes at the atomic scales @xmath109 .",
    "hence , one can expect sufficiently strong sample - to - sample fluctuations of the josephson current even for junctions with nearly identical parameters .",
    "let us first consider the limit of relatively short @xmath11 junctions in which case we obtain @xmath110 , \\label{i}\\ ] ] where we defined @xmath111 and an effective normal transmission of the junction @xmath112 eq .",
    "( [ i ] ) has exactly the same functional form as the result derived by haberkorn _",
    "@xcite for @xmath113 junctions with an arbitrary transmission of the insulating barrier .",
    "this result is recovered from our eqs .",
    "( [ i ] ) , ( [ t ] ) if we assume e.g. @xmath114 in which case the total transmission ( [ t ] ) reduces to @xmath115 .",
    "as we have already discussed the total transmission @xmath116 and , hence , the josephson current fluctuate depending on the exact position of the bound states inside the junction .",
    "the resonant transmission is achieved for @xmath117 , in which case we get @xmath118 this equation demonstrates that for symmetric junctions @xmath119 at resonance the josephson current does not depend on the barrier transmission at all . in this case @xmath120 and our result ( [ i ] ) coincides with the formula derived by kulik and omelyanchuk@xcite for ballistic constrictions . in the limit of low transmissions",
    "@xmath121 we recover the standard breit - wigner formula @xmath122 and reproduce the result obtained by glazman and matveev@xcite for the problem of resonant tunneling through a single anderson impurity between two superconductors .",
    "note that our results ( [ i]-[t ] ) also support the conclusion reached by beenakker@xcite that the josephson current across sufficiently short junctions has a universal form and depends only on the total scattering matrix of the weak link which can be evaluated in the normal state .",
    "although this conclusion is certainly correct in the limit @xmath123 , its applicability range depends significantly on the physical nature of the scattering region . from eqs .",
    "( [ j ] ) , ( [ w ] ) we observe that the result ( [ i ] ) , ( [ d1 ] ) applies at @xmath124 not very close to the resonance . on the other hand , at resonance",
    "the above result is valid only under a more stringent condition @xmath125 , where we define @xmath126max@xmath127 .",
    "now let us briefly analyze the opposite limit of sufficiently long junctions @xmath128 . here",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the most interesting case @xmath129 . from eqs .",

    "for a fully transparent channel @xmath132 the above expression reduces to the well known ishii - kulik result@xcite @xmath133 whereas if one transmission is small @xmath134 and @xmath135 we reproduce the result@xcite @xmath136 provided the transmissions of both @xmath137-interfaces are low @xmath138 we obtain in the off - resonant region @xmath139,\\ ] ] where @xmath140 $ ] is a @xmath141-periodic function defined as @xmath142=\\frac{x}{\\sin{x}},\\quad   -\\pi < x<\\pi.\\ ] ] in the vicinity of the resonance @xmath143 the above result does not hold anymore .",
    "exactly at resonance @xmath144 we get @xmath145 for a symmetric junction @xmath146 this formula yields @xmath147 while in a strongly asymmetric case @xmath114 we again arrive at the expression ( [ z ] ) .",
    "this implies that at resonance the barrier with higher transmission @xmath95 becomes effectively transparent even if @xmath148 .",
    "we conclude that for @xmath121 the maximum josephson current is proportional to the product of transmissions @xmath149 off resonance , whereas exactly at resonance it is proportional to the lowest of two transmissions @xmath94 or @xmath95 .",
    "we observe that both for short and long @xmath11 junctions interference effects may enhance the josephson effect or partially suppress it depending on the exact positions of the bound states inside the junction .",
    "we also note that in order to evaluate the supercurrent across @xmath11 junctions it is in general _ not _ sufficient to derive the transmission probability for the corresponding @xmath150 structure . although the normal transmission of the above structure is given by eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) for _ all _ values of @xmath84 , the correct expression for the josephson current can be recovered by combining eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) with the results@xcite in the limit of short junctions @xmath151 only . in this case",
    "one can neglect suppression of the anomalous green functions inside the normal layer and , hence , the information about the normal transmission turns out to be sufficient . on the contrary , for",
    "longer junctions the decay of cooper pair amplitudes inside the @xmath6-layer can not be anymore disregarded . in this case",
    "the supercurrent will deviate from the form ( [ i ] ) even though the normal transmission of the junction ( [ t ] ) will remain unchanged .",
    "this deviation becomes particularly pronounced for long junctions , i.e. for @xmath152 out of resonance and for @xmath153 at resonance .",
    "the above analysis can trivially be generalized to the case of an arbitrary number of independent conducting channels inside the junction @xmath154 .",
    "in that case the supercurrent is simply given by the sum of the contributions from all the channels .",
    "although all these contributions have the same form , they are in general not equal because the phase factors @xmath92 change randomly for different channels . accordingly , mesoscopic fluctuations of the supercurrent should become smaller with increasing number of channels and eventually disappear in the limit of large @xmath6 .",
    "in the latter limit the josephson current is obtained by averaging over all values of the phase @xmath92 .",
    "the corresponding results are presented below .",
    "averaging over the phase factors @xmath92 is effectively performed by integrating over directions of the electron momentum in eq .",

    "let us make use of this result in order to perform a direct comparison between our analysis and the approach based on the eilenberger equations supplemented by zaitsev boundary conditions .",
    "the corresponding calculation within the latter approach is performed in appendix b. it is interesting to observe that for @xmath11 junctions this calculation yields exactly the same result ( [ jn ] ) , ( [ q ] ) as obtained within our calculation after averaging over the scattering phase @xmath161 .",

    "quantum interference effects occur between electrons scattered at different metallic interfaces or other potential barriers and can strongly influence the supercurrent across the system .",
    "the standard quasiclassical approach which describes scattering at interfaces by means of the nonlinear boundary conditions @xcite for energy - integrated eilenberger propagators  while very efficient in numerous other situations  is in general not suitable for the problem in question . because of this reason we made use of an alternative quasiclassical approach which allows to investigate superconducting systems with more than one potential barrier and fully accounts for the interference effects . within this approach scattering at boundaries",
    "is described with the aid of linear boundary conditions for quasiclassical amplitude functions .",
    "electron propagation between boundaries is described by linear quasiclassical equations .",
    "our approach is technically not equivalent to one based on the bogolyubov - de gennes equations . in particular , our method allows to explicitly construct two - point green functions of the system and bypass such intermediate steps as finding an exact energy spectrum of the system with subsequent summation over the energy eigenvalues inevitable within the bogolyubov - de gennes approach . on the other hand ,",
    "if needed , the full information about the energy bound states can easily be recovered within our technique by finding the poles of the green functions in the matsubara frequency plane .    within our method we evaluated the dc josephson current in @xmath7 junctions containing two and three insulating barriers with arbitrary transmissions , respectively @xmath11 and @xmath12 junctions .",
    "for the system with two barriers and few conducting channels we found strong fluctuations of the josephson critical current depending on the exact position of the resonant level inside the junction .",
    "for short junctions @xmath292 at resonance the josephson current does not depend on the barrier transmission @xmath4 and is given by the standard kulik - omelyanchuk formula @xcite derived for ballistic weak links . in the limit of long @xmath7 junctions @xmath152",
    "resonant effects may also lead to strong enhancement of the supercurrent , in this case at @xmath181 and at resonance the josephson current is proportional to @xmath4 and not to @xmath293 as it would be in the absence of interference effects .",
    "it is also interesting to observe that , while the above results for few conducting channels can not be obtained by means of the approach employing zaitsev boundary conditions , in the many channel limit and for junctions with two barriers the latter approach _ does _ allow to recover correct results .",
    "this is because the contributions sensitive to the scattering phase are effectively averaged out during summation over conducting channels or , which is the same , during averaging of the current over the directions of the fermi velocity .",
    "quantum interference effects turn out to be even more important in the proximity systems which contain three insulating barriers . in this case",
    "the quasiclassical approach based on zaitsev boundary conditions fails even in the limit of many conducting channels . in that limit",
    "the josephson current is _ decreased _ for short junctions ( @xmath294 ) as compared to the case of independent barriers ( @xmath274 ) .",
    "this effect is caused by destructive interference of electrons reflected from different barriers and indicates the tendency of the system towards localization . in contrast , for long @xmath7 junctions with three barriers an interplay between quantum interference and proximity effect leads to enhancement of the josephson current at @xmath181 : we obtained the dependence @xmath295 instead of @xmath296 for independent barriers .",
    "we also discuss some further concrete results which turn out to be quite sensitive to the details of the model .    finally , we note that in a very recent publication@xcite ozana and shelankov analyzed the applicability of the quasiclassical technique for the case of superconducting sandwiches with several insulating barriers . for such systems they also arrived at the conclusion that in the many channel limit the standard quasiclassical scheme based on the eilenberger equations _ and _ zaitsev boundary conditions effectively breaks down in the presence of more than two reflecting interfaces .",
    "these authors argued that in such cases this scheme disregards certain classes of interfering quasiclassical paths .",
    "this conclusion@xcite is similar to one reached in the present paper for @xmath7 structures .",
    "we would like to point out , however , that from our point of view the failure of the above scheme is not so much due to the quasiclassical approximation and/or normalization conditions employed within the eilenberger formalism .",

    "<S> we analyze an interplay between the proximity effect and quantum interference of electrons in hybrid structures superconductor - normal metal - superconductor which contain several insulating barriers . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the dc josephson current in these structures may change qualitatively due to quantum interference of electrons scattered at different interfaces . in junctions with few conducting channels mesoscopic fluctuations of the supercurrent are significant and its amplitude can be strongly enhanced due to resonant effects . in the many channel limit averaging over the scattering phase effectively suppresses interference effects for systems with _ two _ insulating barriers . in that case </S>",
    "<S> a standard quasiclassical approach describing scattering at interfaces by means of zaitsev boundary conditions allows to reproduce the correct results . </S>",
    "<S> however , in systems with _ three _ or more barriers the latter approach fails even in the many channel limit . in such systems interference effects remain important in this limit as well . for short junctions </S>",
    "<S> these effects result in additional suppression of the josephson critical current indicating the tendency of the system towards localization . </S>",
    "<S> for relatively long junctions interference effects may  on the contrary  enhance the supercurrent with respect to the case of independent barriers .    2 </S>"
