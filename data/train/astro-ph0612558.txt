    "deep , high - resolution imaging with telescopes such as the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) has revealed that the majority of high redshift galaxies are morphologically different from the majority of galaxies nearby .",
    "they appear to have morphologies similar to the relatively rare , low redshift irregular and peculiar galaxies ( e.g. , driver et al . 1995 , 1998 ; glazebrook et al . 1995 ; abraham et al . 1996 ; odewahn et al . 1996 ; ellis 1997 ; i m et al .",

    "the greater percentage of merging galaxies at high redshift suggests that there was an evolution in the number of merging and interacting galaxies throughout the history of the universe , which supports models of hierarchical galaxy formation ( e.g. , white 1979 ; white & frenk 1991 ; cole et al . 1994 ; kauffmann et al . 1997 ; roukema et al . 1997 ; baugh et al . 1998 ; nagashima et al . 2001 , 2002 ) . to reveal how galaxies assemble and",
    "evolve over time , it is therefore essential to conduct detailed comparisons of galaxies as a function of redshift . to carry out these comparisons",
    "it is critical to have a representative baseline at @xmath1 .",
    "we present in this paper a sample of 199 nearby galaxies , observed from the ultraviolet to the optical red , which can be used as an effective comparison to higher redshift sources .",
    "morphology has also arisen in recent years as a major method for findings major mergers between galaxies and understanding their role in galaxy formation ( conselice 2006 ) .",
    "mergers are predicted to be the dominate factor in galaxy formation within the cold dark matter model ( e.g. , cole et al .",
    "2000 ) , and testing this concept in detail is of major importance .",
    "extensive work has gone into improving on the traditional hubble sequence , which does not distinguish between the large variety of galaxies that fall into the catch - all irregular class ( e.g. irregular , peculiar and merging galaxies ) .",
    "it is of particular importance , especially at high redshift , to find a method that quantifies the morphologies of both normal galaxies and the dominant population of irregular / peculiar galaxies .",
    "hubble typing is also a somewhat subjective method of classification that requires visual inspection of each individual galaxy . with the advent of large deep sky surveys that produce images of hundreds to thousands of galaxies at a time , it is essential to develop an automated method of objectively classifying galaxies , using a system that describes something about the physical properties that shape their light distributions , independent of rest - frame wavelength .",
    "one of the parameters developed for use in automated galaxy classification is the concentration index ( c ) ( abraham et al .",
    "1994 , 1996 ) .",
    "this parameter measures how centrally concentrated the light distribution is within a galaxy , which is a tracer of the disk - to - bulge ratio .",
    "abraham et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1996 ) show that classifications through this parameter are less dependent on high spatial resolution than on hubble type , and thus are more robust at high redshift and in poor ground - based seeing conditions .",
    "schade et al . (",
    "1995 ) , abraham et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and conselice ( 1997 ) introduced very basic methods for measuring the rotational asymmetry index ( a ) to describe the degree of peculiarity and asymmetry in the light distribution of nearby galaxies and galaxies imaged with hst at redshifts of z @xmath2 .",
    "the asymmetry index was later vastly improved through the use of standardized radii and centering techniques ( conselice et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the asymmetry parameter is particularly useful for identifying merging and strongly interacting galaxies , which tend to have very high asymmetries .",
    "another parameter , introduced by isserstedt & schindler ( 1986 ) , quantifies the ratio of smoothly distributed light to the clumped light distribution .",
    "this clumpiness index ( s ) compares the amount of light in star - forming clusters and associations to the light in a more diffuse older disk population , which correlates with hydrogen recombination lines ( h@xmath3 ) ( takamiya 1999 ) , and gives an indication of the recent star - formation activity within the galaxy ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "other authors proposed improved methods of measuring these concentration , asymmetry , and clumpiness ( cas ) parameters , making them less sensitive to the choice of galaxy center , surface - brightness cut - offs , signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio , and resolution effects ( e.g. bershady et al .",
    "2000 ; conselice et al .",
    "2000 ; conselice 2003 ; lotz et al .",
    "the cas parameters were found to correlate with each other , as well as other fundamental parameters such as galaxy color , luminosity , size , surface - brightness , and star formation rate ( isserstedt & schindler 1986 ; abraham et al .",
    "1996 ; takamiya 1999 ; bershady et al .",
    "2000 ; corbin et al .",
    "galaxy types are separated - out within parameter spaces involving color , surface - brightness , and various combinations of the cas parameters , providing a method of galaxy classification that is relatively robust over a large range of redshifts ( bershady et al .",
    "2000 ; conselice et al .",
    "2000 , conselice et al . 2003 ; conselice 2003 ) .",
    "galaxies , however , can look substantially different at shorter wavelengths than at longer ones ( e.g. , bohlin et al .",

    "1992 ; kuchinski et al . 2000 , 2001 ; marcum et al . 2001",
    "; windhorst et al .",
    "2002 ) . hence , if the morphological @xmath4-correction is significant , cas measurements for low redshift galaxies in rest - frame optical light and high redshift galaxies in rest - frame ultraviolet light may not be directly comparable .",
    "for example , schade et al .",
    "( 1995 ) found that their galaxies ( z @xmath2 ) looked more irregular in their @xmath5 images ( rest - frame uv ) than at longer wavelengths , which will all have an effect on quantitative galaxy parameters .",
    "jansen ( 2000 ) noted a similar systematic shift from @xmath6 to @xmath7 for galaxies in the nearby field galaxy survey .",
    "we also observe this effect when comparing hst / wfpc2 uv and near - infrared ( ir ) images available for a subset of the galaxies presented in windhorst et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . in the present paper , we quantitatively analyze how the cas parameters vary as a function of rest - frame wavelength and morphological type for a sample of 199 nearby galaxies observed in a combination of nine pass - bands ranging from the far - uv to the near - ir",
    ". we will apply these results to the high redshift universe in a future paper ( conselice , et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) .",
    "as described in detail in taylor et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , we have selected for study a sample of 199 nearby galaxies that consists mostly of late - type spiral , irregular , and peculiar / merging galaxies .",
    "these late - types are among the galaxies at z @xmath8 that most resemble the majority of high redshift galaxies , and are less studied and less well - understood than nearby earlier - type galaxies . also , jansen ( 2000 ) found that most of the wavelength dependence of the asymmetry is due to galaxies of type sbc and later ( de vaucouleurs type , t @xmath9 ) .",
    "thus , most of the difference in asymmetries between the @xmath6 and @xmath7-band occurs for later morphological hubble types . as such",
    ", late - type galaxies are more suited for this analysis than early - type galaxies . the selected morphological distribution for our sample is shown in figure 1 .",

    "the concentration index , c , is computed by determining the total sky - subtracted light contained within @xmath35 the petrosian radius ( r@xmath36 ) ( petrosian 1976 ) , and finding the logarithmic ratio of the radius within which 80% of this light is contained ( r@xmath37 ) to the radius within which 20% of this light is contained ( r@xmath38 ) ( conselice et al . 2000 ) .",

    "the ratio of the residual subtracted flux to the original galaxy flux yields a : @xmath42 noise corrections were applied by subtracting the asymmetry of an empty background region ( b ) , and iterative centering corrections were applied to minimize a , since gross centering errors would artificially increase a. asymmetries range from a = 0 to 2 , with a = 0 corresponding to a truly symmetric galaxy ( e.g. , some ellipticals ; see jansen(2000 ) for an example of a highly symmetric spiral galaxy ) , and a = 2 corresponding to a completely asymmetric galaxy .",
    "the clumpiness index , s , is defined as the ratio of the amount of light in high spatial frequency structures within @xmath35 r@xmath36 to the total amount of light in the galaxy within that radius ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "this was done by subtracting a boxcar - smoothed image from the original image to produce an image that contains only the high - frequency structure .",
    "the central pixels within 1/20th of the total radius were set to zero to exclude them from the parameter measurements .",

    "galaxies with more high - frequency structure are more patchy in appearance , and will have a higher value of s.",
    "the effects of spatial resolution on the cas parameters are discussed in detail in conselice ( 2003 ) and conselice et al .",

    "2000 ; lotz et al .",
    "2004 ) . at resolutions better than this limit ,",
    "conselice ( 2003 ) found that the asymmetry index does not depend strongly on the resolution or seeing of the image , with 70% of the value of a , as measured in the optical , attributable to overall global distortions in the galaxy , and 30% due to localized high - frequency structures , such as star - forming regions .",
    "low s / n ratios within the galaxy can also decrease the reliability of the cas measurements ( conselice et al .",
    "2000 ; lotz et al .",
    "conselice et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found that asymmetries can be computed most reliably when the integrated s / n ratio @xmath48 per object .",
    "these s / n and resolution reliability limits , however , are rather conservative , and would result in poor ( or no ) number statistics in some of our galaxy type - bins .",
    "therefore , in this section we will investigate the effects of s / n and spatial resolution in our data , and determine the limits of each that are appropriate for our analysis .",
    "we determined the spatial resolution in kpc from the recessional velocities listed in the rc3 ( using v@xmath21 when available , or v@xmath49 otherwise ) .",
    "total s / n ratios were measured within 1.5 times the petrosian radius .      for the @xmath10 images observed at the vatt ,",
    "the images of each galaxy were convolved to the worst seeing for that galaxy ( typically in the @xmath6-band ) , using a gaussian of the appropriate width within the task ` gauss ` in iraf .",
    "the seeing of each image was determined by finding the average fwhm ( full width at half max ) of all stars detected with sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) , as described in detail in taylor et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .    in order to consistently compare images of a galaxy with ground - based seeing to those from hst / wfpc2 ( fwhm@xmath50014 )",
    ", it may be necessary to convolve the hst images to the same resolution as the ground - based data .",
    "we test this by examining the effect on the cas parameter measurements after convolving the hst images ( as for the vatt ) to the @xmath51 average u - band seeing at the vatt .",
    "the left three panels in figure 3 show the difference between the cas measurements from the convolved and unconvolved hst images in each filter vs. the measurements in the unconvolved images .",
    "the right - most panels show the median of these differences for each filter .",
    "horizontal dotted lines indicate when convolution does not affect the cas parameters .",
    "different symbols in figure 3 are used for measurements from images where the galaxy had low s / n ( large open squares : s / n @xmath52 , small open squares : @xmath53 s / n @xmath54 ) , and where the galaxy had low physical resolution ( large open triangles : r @xmath55 kpc , small open triangles : 1.00 @xmath56 r @xmath57 kpc ) .",
    "there is no real trend with low s / n or spatial resolution , although most of the extreme outliers have low s / n or , in exceptional cases , low resolution .",
    "the differences between cas parameters at the two different resolutions are most pronounced in the f255w images , which had the lowest s / n ratio , and thus the highest uncertainties in these parameters .",
    "convolving these images resulted in boosting the signal in each resolution element , as well as smoothing over high - frequency structure in the noisy background , which is strongly affected by charge transfer effects ( cte ) .",
    "this results in more reliable cas values that are not as severely affected by spikes in the sky background , as can be seen by considering the a and s panels in figure 3 .",
    "vertical dotted lines in these panels represent the limit below which the a and s values measured in the sky were higher than those measured in the galaxy ( a @xmath58 , s @xmath58 ) . for these extreme cases , convolving the images increased the signal and decreased the noise , which resulted in increasing most of the negative values of a and s into the positive regime .",
    "cte - noise effects are also present in the data from the other wfpc2 filters , although it is not as strong of a factor in the longer wavelength pass - bands due to the higher s / n ratio of the galaxies and the more significant zodiacal sky - brightness filling in the low - level cte - traps .",
    "a combination of smoothing over the noise and the high - frequency structure of the galaxy itself has an effect on the cas parameters in all filters , to varying extents .",
    "overall , the concentration index does not change significantly with spatial resolution , especially at longer wavelengths .",
    "the median values of the change in c after convolving the hst images to the ground - based seeing are 0.228 , 0.002 , and 0.028 in f255w , f300w , and f814w , respectively ( these values will be given in this filter order for the rest of this paragraph ) .",
    "this is marginally greater than the median uncertainty on the individual unconvolved values of c in f255w ( 0.209 ) , and well within the median uncertainties in f300w and f814w ( 0.030 for both ) .",
    "the asymmetry index is more affected by convolution , although there is no trend in this effect with increasing a. this is likely due to a boost in s / n per resolution element , which improves the reliability of the measurement ( lotz et al .",

    "changed a by a median value of 0.369 , 0.083 , and 0.021 , respectively .",
    "except for the noisy f255w images , this is roughly within the median uncertainties of 0.181 , 0.078 , and 0.044 , respectively .",
    "the clumpiness index , however , was more strongly affected by the resolution change , with intrinsically clumpy galaxies showing a strong trend in all filters toward decreasing clumpiness with decreasing resolution .",
    "this is to be expected , as s is designed to measure high - frequency structure , and star clusters and associations may be resolved in the unconvolved hst images . convolving the images changed the median s by 0.840 , 0.780 , and 0.215 , respectively .",
    "these are relatively significant differences , and much larger than the median uncertainties on s of 0.249 , 0.256 , and 0.135 , illustrating that real structure being smoothed over lowers the measured s values .    with the above caveats , throughout the remainder of this paper we therefore use the cas values measured in hst images convolved to match the resolution of our ground - based vatt images , to reduce the effects of background noise and to offer a more systematic comparison .",
    "we note that with the exception of f814w , this does not do gross injustice to the high resolution hst images , since the f255w and f300w filters are below the atmospheric cut - off , and therefore are unique data even at lower resolution .      of the 143 galaxies observed with the vatt , 16 have spatial resolutions between 1.00 and 2.20 kpc in the u - band image , which is above the reliability limit of 1 kpc quoted in conselice et al .",

    "( 2000 ) reliability limit of 100 .",
    "these limits ( hereafter referred to as limit@xmath59 ) are conservative , however , so it may be acceptable to use more relaxed limits in the interest of conserving higher number statistics .",
    "if we relax the limits by 25% ( defined as limit@xmath60 ) , we find 9 galaxies with r @xmath55 kpc , and no galaxies with s / n @xmath52 .",
    "of the 90 galaxies observed with the hst in f300w ( 11 of which were also observed in f255w , and 60 in f814w ) , 6 have @xmath61 r @xmath62 kpc , and 2 have r @xmath55 kpc . in f255w , 7 galaxies have s / n @xmath54 , and 3 have s / n @xmath52 . in f300w ,",
    "5 galaxies have s / n @xmath54 , and 2 have s / n @xmath52 .",
    "all galaxies observed in f814w have s / n @xmath63 .",
    "the galex images have a stellar fwhm of @xmath505 , which is @xmath503@xmath64 larger than that of the vatt and the convolved hst data .",
    "the cas values , however , should still be reliably determined , as long as the spatial resolutions of the galaxies are within the above reliability limit .",
    "of the 14 galaxies observed with galex , 7 have r @xmath65 kpc , with resolutions between 1.41 and 2.37 kpc . one additional galaxy ( ngc1396 ) was barely detected in the fuv .",

    "in several of our sparsely populated bins , however , measurement uncertainties and peculiarities of individual galaxies would dominate . if we can relax the conselice et al .",
    "( 2000 ) limits of s / n @xmath63 and r @xmath66 kpc ( limit@xmath59 ) without having a significant effect on the median cas values , we can then improve the number statistics in our type - bins while still obtaining reasonably high reliability .",
    "as such , we have tested the effects of applying limit@xmath59 to our relatively well - sampled vatt and hst f300w and f814w data set against applying a more liberal limit of s / n @xmath67 and r @xmath57 kpc ( limit@xmath60 ) .",
    "table 2 summarizes the results .",
    "the median cas parameters in each type - bin were calculated for the entire data set ( `` all '' ) , and separately for those data meeting each of the reliability requirements we are considering ( limit@xmath59 and limit@xmath60 ) . since we find little difference in the results between filters for each telescope , we average the medians over @xmath6 , @xmath5 , @xmath20 , and @xmath7 for the vatt , and over f300w and f814w for hst . table 2 lists the difference between these medians calculated with limit@xmath59 and all of the data , and also the difference between the medians calculated with limit@xmath59 and limit@xmath60 . the final column in table 2 gives the average uncertainty on the difference between the medians for a given parameter observed with the vatt or hst .",
    "these uncertainties were calculated by taking the quadratic sum of the median range of cas values , averaged over the relevant filters , and normalized by the square - root of the average number of galaxies per type - bin .",
    "although in a few individual sparsely populated type - bins the median cas values are affected at the @xmath681@xmath69 level , we find that for the vast majority of bins the median values do not change by relaxing our limits on minimum s / n and spatial resolution from limit@xmath59 to limit@xmath60 .",
    "this is also the case for the galex and f255w data .",

    "similarly , early - type ( e  s0 ) galaxies have very little overlap with later galaxy types in asymmetry index , particularly at longer wavelengths .",
    "galaxies with a @xmath86 are likely early - types ( e  s0 ) , which is essentially true at all wavelengths .",

    "almost all early - type ( e  s0 ) galaxies have s @xmath87 , but not all galaxies with s @xmath87 are early - types . there is a single early - type galaxy with a high s measurement in the nuv , but this is likely due to low s / n in the parts of the galaxy just outside its bright inner core . although all of the later ( sa  im and peculiar / merging ) galaxy type distributions are offset slightly from each other in mean c , a , and s , there is a large overlap between their cas parameter values .",
    "therefore , the cas parameters can not be used independently to classify individual galaxies with types later than sa , but they can be used to describe something about the overall distribution of types as a whole in a large sample . nonetheless , it is note - worthy that a subset of the peculiar / merging galaxies , predominantly major mergers , display high asymmetry indices at longer wavelengths that are not seen for the other galaxy types .",
    "the next two sections discuss using a combination of the cas parameters as a more reliable way of determining the morphological distributions within a galaxy sample .",

    "an edge - on orientation did not have a significant effect on the location of a galaxy within this parameter space . on average , the more nearby galaxies tend to be slightly more asymmetric and less concentrated than their more distant counterparts , which results from their partial resolution into individual stars , as well as a possible selection bias favoring low luminosity dwarf systems at that distance .",

    "measurements of s @xmath58 can occur for particularly smooth or faint galaxies where the sky was measured to be more clumpy than the galaxy itself .",
    "this is more likely to occur with hst / wfpc2 , due to large noise spikes caused by local cte effects .",
    "the degree to which these s measurements lie below zero is within the uncertainties on s , however .",

    "outliers from the general trend in the shorter wavelengths have particularly low s / n in the images , while outliers in the longer wavelengths are either edge - on or are very nearby ( with resolution , r @xmath88 pc ) . due to the strong dust lanes visible in edge - on galaxies , they appear more clumpy than galaxies with lower inclinations , and lie well above the general s vs. a relation . on the whole",

    "there is a much larger scatter in the cas parameters at shorter wavelengths , which may partially be due to larger measurement uncertainties for these filters and smaller number statistics .",
    "more , and higher quality data in the mid to far - uv is needed to further constrain these values .",
    "there is a clear trend among normal galaxies to show a progression from early to late - type galaxies ( e to i m ) of increasing asymmetry and clumpiness and decreasing concentration , particularly in the redder filters .",
    "the different peculiar / merging galaxy types are each located at different positions within this parameter space . there appears to be a general evolutionary trend from pre - mergers to mergers , and then to post - mergers , as shown by the dotted lines with arrows connecting the average of the median values for each type - bin .",
    "mergers become significantly less concentrated , more asymmetric , and more clumpy than pre - mergers , then progress back toward the normal galaxy parameter space as they turn into merger remnants , which end up being more concentrated than the pre - mergers , and slightly more asymmetric and clumpy . from there , galaxies may take different paths on the cas parameter space depending on whether they turn into elliptical or spiral galaxies , which depends on the details of the merger and of the individual galaxies taking part in that merger .",
    "one of the major goals of quantitative morphological studies is to automatically distinguish galaxy types from each other .",
    "this has proven to be a difficult problem , and various pieces of information , such as colors , magnitude and sizes , are needed in addition to the cas parameters to fully classify galaxies into various hubble types automatically .",
    "no perfect method has yet been developed .",
    "we can however determine how well basic cas classification boundaries do in terms of automatically finding galaxies of various types , without any other information involved .",
    "a revised cas classification space can be defined as follows for finding galaxies with early , mid , late and merger / peculiar morphologies in rest - frame optical images ( see bershady et al .",
    "early - types are systems with a @xmath90 and typically c @xmath91 , mid - types are those with @xmath92 a @xmath93 and c @xmath94 , late types with @xmath95 a @xmath93 and c @xmath96 , and finally mergers have a @xmath97 and a @xmath98 ( conselice et al . 2004 ) . to carry out the cas reliability test we examined the position in cas space of each morphology type to determine what fraction of eye - ball estimates of morphology match the cas classification boundaries , that is the fraction that are correctly matched ( f@xmath99 ) .",
    "we also measure the fraction of galaxies within each cas type volume which do not belong to the assigned type , which we call the contamination fraction ( f@xmath100 ) .",
    "we remove the nearby galaxies from this analysis to avoid resolution issues .",
    "it turns out that the best results are within the optical region , where the cas system was originally designed to work .",
    "we find that for early - types , f@xmath101 1 in the @xmath10 and f814w bands .",
    "the f225w , nuv and fuv bands only have a few early - types which are too faint for a reliable cas measurement , but their asymmetry values tend to be a bit higher .",
    "the contamination is also very low with f@xmath100 = 0 for early - types in the ubvr bands .",
    "most of the contamination in the optical within the a @xmath90 cas space is largely due to mid - types .",
    "however , we only have a few early - types and mid - types in our sample , and we are mainly interest in distinguishing late - types from mergers / peculiars , as these galaxies dominate the high redshift population",
    ".    the separation of mergers from late - type galaxies can be successfully done within cas space , although there is some overlap .",
    "the particular problem , first stated in conselice ( 2003 ) , is that not all peculiar / mergers follow the cas space definition of high asymmetry .",
    "conselice ( 2003 ) made this conclusion based on the location of 66 ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) in cas space .",
    "about half met the criteria a @xmath97 , while the remainder were at lower asymmetry , with the systems spread out amongst the concentration index . using the standard criteria listed above",
    ", we find that for late - types , f@xmath102 in the @xmath10 and f814w bands , with the lowest fraction f@xmath103 for the u band , and the highest f@xmath104 in f814w .",
    "using the same cas criteria for finding late - types , we find that the contamination ranges from 50% in the u - band , to 20% in the f814w band , and about 40% in the bvr bands .",
    "a large part of this contamination arises from peculiar and merging galaxies , which have similar asymmetries .",
    "however 70% of galaxies in the late - type regime are classified as late - type by eye , which is a reasonable success rate .",
    "the fraction of mergers found with the basic cas criteria is not as high , with f@xmath105 in the @xmath10 bands , and 0.6 in the f814w band .",
    "the contamination is also fairly low , with f@xmath106 0.2 .",
    "this result shows that while most galaxies with a high asymmetry in the ubri bands will be mergers / peculiars , not all mergers / peculiars have large asymmetries ( see conselice 2003 ) .",
    "likewise , some high - a galaxies , particularly in the bluer bands are not classified as a merger or peculiar .",
    "it is worth noting that the best results are obtained using the reddest band , f814w , which suggests that measurements of galaxy structure are best done in the reddest wave - band possible .",
    "a major goal of this paper is to test whether we can tell the difference between late - type star forming galaxies and mergers through the cas parameters in the ultraviolet .",
    "it turns out that the ability to distinguish late - types from mergers / peculiars is slightly worse in the uv than in the optical , but not by much . using the standard cas method , 50% of eye - ball classified late - types fall in their correct cas region in the nuv .",
    "the late - types in the uv which do not fall in the correct uv - cas region typically have high asymmetries , a @xmath97 ( figure 11 ) .",
    "generally , these galaxies have high clumpiness values as well .",
    "we can use this fact to better automatically separate late - type galaxies from mergers / peculiars in the ultraviolet . if we take the following criteria :    @xmath107    we acquire 60% of the late - types , with a 40% contamination rate from mostly peculiars / mergers in the f300w and u - bands .",
    "this contamination is again largely the result of peculiar / mergers .    using the standard revised optical cas method for finding mergers ( a @xmath97 and a @xmath98 ) we find that all mergers / peculiars are identified in the fuv , 50% in the nuv , 75% in the f225w band and 40% in the f300w band .",
    "the contamination rates within the area of cas for mergers in the fuv , nuv , f225w and f300w are 0% , 0% , 25% , and 33% respectively .",
    "it is clear from figures 1114 that the asymmetry limit of a @xmath97 has a contamination from late - type galaxies .",
    "this is due to the increased prominence of star formation in the uv , creating high asymmetries which are sensitive to star formation and merging activity ( conselice et al .",
    ". however , if we increase the limit to a @xmath108 in the uv , we are able to obtain a nearly clean sample of mergers .",
    "this new uv - cas criteria for finding mergers is :    @xmath109    using equation ( 5 ) to find mergers in the f300w band we get f@xmath101 0.4 , while f@xmath110 . in the f255w band",
    "the contamination is also low , f@xmath110 , and the f@xmath101 0.75 , although there are too few merging galaxies ( 3 ) in this pass - band to draw definite conclusions .",
    "the nuv and fuv bands have too few galaxies to reliably compute these statistics .",
    "we suggest that future studies that use rest - frame uv morphologies of high redshift galaxies use the uv - cas equations ( 45 ) to separate late - types from mergers , although larger number statistics in the uv are needed to verify these results .",
    "some of the galaxies in our sample appear different in the uv than they do in the optical , while some galaxies appear very similar .",
    "this was discussed qualitatively in detail in windhorst et al .",
    "figure 16 shows examples of each of these cases .",
    "the upper image for each galaxy was obtained with either the f814w near - ir filter , or the vatt r - band filter .",
    "the lower image for each galaxy was obtained with either the f300w uv filter , or the vatt u - band filter .",
    "ugc05189 is a merger remnant that has a large difference in asymmetries and clumpiness indices between the uv and the ir ( a@xmath111  a@xmath112 = 0.182 , and s@xmath111 ",
    "s@xmath112 = 0.49 ) , mostly due to bright star - forming knots that are more apparent in the uv image .",
    "ugc06816 is a late - type barred spiral galaxy that has a large difference in a and s between the near - uv and the red ( a@xmath113  a@xmath114 = 0.323 , and s@xmath113 ",
    "s@xmath114 = 0.64 ) , which is also due to its uv - bright star - formating knots , particularly at the ends of its bar and at two sites of vigorous star formation along its poorly organized spiral pattern .",
    "both of these galaxies have small differences in concentration index between these filters ( 0.178 for ugc05189 , and 0.207 for ugc06816 ) .",
    "ugc12808 is an earlier - type spiral galaxy that has about the same asymmetry and clumpiness index in both pass - bands ( a@xmath111  a@xmath112 = 0.045 , and s@xmath111 ",
    "s@xmath112 = 0.05 ) .",
    "ugc06697 is a peculiar , highly inclined galaxy that also has about the same asymmetry and clumpiness index in both pass - bands ( a@xmath111  a@xmath112 = 0.035 , and s@xmath111 ",
    "s@xmath112 = 0.16 ) . both of these galaxies , however , appear different in the uv than in the ir due to a large difference in concentration index between the filters ( 0.664 for ugc12808 and 0.515 for ugc06697 ) , which is largely due to the diminished appearance of their red bulges at shorter wavelengths .",
    "a quantitative discussion of the dependence of the cas parameters on rest - frame wavelength and galaxy type could serve as a zero - redshift benchmark for higher redshift galaxy classifications .",
    "as such , we present the results for our dataset below .",
    "figure 17 shows the median values of the cas parameters for each type - bin as a function of the central wavelength ( @xmath11 ) of each filter in nm .",
    "values of the cas parameters that were @xmath115 were not included in the median , as well as values from galaxy images that did not meet our reliability criteria .",
    "we do not include medians in this plot for filters and type - bins that have fewer than 2 galaxies .",
    "error bars that are the same color as the data points indicate the 2575% quartile range .",
    "magenta error bars indicate the error on the median , which is smaller for bins that contain larger number statistics .",
    "we find a large scatter among individual galaxies , but there is a general trend of increasing c and decreasing a and s toward longer wavelengths . as in previous plots of the cas parameters , on average ,",
    "the early - type , late - type , and merging / peculiar galaxy classes are clearly separated in c , a , and s , although there is considerable overlap among individual galaxies within each type class .",
    "the cas values of early - type galaxies ( e  s0 ) are relatively constant with increasing rest - frame wavelength longward of the balmer break .",
    "shortward of the balmer break , the",
    "s / n of these red objects is very low , and therefore the cas parameter measurement uncertainties are high . due to this effect and due to the lower number of early - type galaxies in our sample , we can not draw definite conclusions about whether the cas parameters of early - type galaxies would differ significantly at uv rest - frame wavelengths .",
    "spiral , irregular , and peculiar / merging galaxies , however , all show a general trend of increasing c and decreasing s and a with increasing rest - frame wavelength .",
    "the concentrations measured in the hst / wfpc2 f814w images appear somewhat lower with respect to the general trend , which may be due to the fact that our wfpc2 images are more sensitive to point - sources than extended sources , so that outlying low surface - brightness material may not have been detected in that particular filter .",
    "also , in figure 17 , linear - least - squares fits to the median data points are shown as dashed lines .",
    "linear fits appear suitable for all but the wavelength dependence of the concentration index of early - type ( e - s0 ) galaxies ( which shows more sharply decreasing c measurements at wavelengths shortward of the balmer break ) , and the asymmetry and clumpiness indices of mid - type ( sa - sc ) galaxies ( which show more sharply increasing a and s measurements shortward of the balmer break ) .",
    "therefore , we also include a 2nd order polynomial fit to the data in these panels , shown as dotted lines .",
    "this strong dependence of c shortward of the balmer break for the e ",
    "s0 galaxies may be mostly due to the very low s / n of these red galaxies in the uv images ( see windhorst et al .",
    "2002 for the images ) .",
    "this 2nd order polynomial is given by : @xmath116 this is a relatively good fit to the data , with  13% uncertainty on each of the coefficients ( compared to a 39% error on the slope of the linear fit , and an error larger than the value of the y - intercept ) .",
    "the strong dependence of a and s shortward of the balmer break for the sa  sc galaxies may be due to uv - bright star - forming regions , although the low number statistics in the bluest two filters ( 2 galaxies ) and the large uncertainties suggest that this may be insignificant .",
    "however , the general trend of larger a and s values at shorter wavelengths is likely real , as the f300w filter contains 11 sa ",
    "sc galaxies , and also shows this trend .",
    "more far - uv data is needed to more accurately determine the trend in this wavelength range .",
    "the 2nd order polynomials for the dependence of a and s on wavelength for sa  sc galaxies are : @xmath117 @xmath118 the uncertainties on these coefficients are @xmath119 , and @xmath120 , respectively , compared to an error on the slope of the linear fits of 17% and 18% , respectively .",
    "the coefficients for the linear - least - squares fit are given in table 9 , where x = x@xmath121 log(@xmath11 ) + x@xmath60 , and where @xmath11 is in units of nm .",
    "the variable x is the concentration index ( c for columns 23 ) , the asymmetry index ( a for columns 45 ) , or the clumpiness index ( s for columns 67 ) . as determined from these fits ,",
    "the early to mid - type spiral galaxies ( sa  sc ) show a significant increase in concentration index at longer rest - frame wavelengths . the late - type ( sd  im ) galaxies , however , have no trend with wavelength within the uncertainties , and there is only a slight trend with wavelength for peculiar / merging galaxies .",
    "there is , however , a significant decrease in asymmetry toward longer wavelengths for all galaxy types .",
    "the clumpiness index also decreases significantly with wavelength for all galaxy types .",
    "the reader should be advised that the linear fits of the wavelength dependence of a and s for sa  sc galaxies do not fit the data as well as the 2nd order polynomial fits presented in eq s 78 .",

    "concentration , asymmetry , and clumpiness ( cas ) indices are basic structural parameters of galaxies .",
    "because the cas parameters are based on the light distributions of galaxies , they describe quantifiable aspects of their morphologies .",
    "a difference in these parameters as a function of wavelength therefore contains information about how a galaxy s appearance changes with rest - frame wavelength , and leads to a measure of the morphological k - correction .",
    "this is important for high redshift studies , because at high redshift these galaxies are observed in their rest - frame uv . to quantify this",
    ", we have presented cas parameter measurements for our sample of 199 mostly late - type and merging / peculiar galaxies observed in various combinations of filters spanning the far - uv through the near - ir .",
    "our results confirm those of previous studies , but over a much wider wavelength range that includes the uv : galaxies are more concentrated , less asymmetric , and less clumpy with redder color and earlier galaxy type . we find that normal and merging / peculiar galaxy type classes occupy different locations within the cas parameter space , such that correlations between the cas parameters can be used for statistical galaxy classification , but in a limited sense due to both intrinsic and observational scatter .    a general evolutionary trend as a merger progresses through its different stages can be drawn from these correlations , with mergers becoming significantly less concentrated , more asymmetric , and more clumpy than pre - mergers , then progressing back toward the normal galaxy parameter space , where they become merger remnants , which are more concentrated and slightly more asymmetric and clumpy than pre - mergers .",
    "we find no significant difference in the cas parameters for early - type galaxies ( e  s0 ) at rest - frame wavelengths longward of the balmer break .",
    "we can not measure the wavelength dependence of the cas parameters of early - type galaxies shortward of the balmer break with great confidence , because these red galaxies have very low s / n in the galex and hst f255w and f300w filters , and because of the lack of good statistics in the far and mid - uv .",
    "however , we find that later type galaxies ( s  im and peculiar / mergers ) observed at shorter wavelengths appear to be less concentrated , more asymmetric , and more clumpy than they would appear to be at longer wavelengths .",
    "therefore , there is little to no morphological k - correction for the cas parameters of early - type galaxies ( e  s0 ) in the optical , but a more significant correction for all other later galaxy types at all wavelengths between the far - uv and near - ir .",
    "these nearby - galaxy results can be used as a benchmark for interpreting the cas morphological parameters of high redshift galaxies observed in the rest - frame uv . the morphological k - correction derived here will help us to determine how much of the difference we see in the morphologies of high redshift galaxies is purely due to band - pass shifting effects , and a comparison of the structural cas parameters between low and high redshift galaxies will provide some understanding of galaxy evolution .",
    "we will address these aspects of the high redshift universe in a future paper ( conselice , et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) .",
    "the current study shows that one cardinal improvement to this work would be to obtain a much larger sample in the mid - uv at @xmath134 the sensitivity , which wfc3 will be able to do after sm4 is launched .",
