    "one - dimensional quasiperiodic schrdinger operators with analytic potentials have traditionally been studied by perturbative kam schemes in two distinct regimes : `` large '' and `` small '' potential .",
    "some 15 years ago it has become understood @xcite that the `` large '' regime can be described in a non - perturbative way through a purely dynamical property : positivity of the lyapunov exponent .",
    "recently , a full nonperturbative ( and purely dynamical ) characterization of the entire `` small '' regime for the case of one - frequency operators has also been established @xcite , thus leading to the division of energies in the spectrum into    1 .",
    "_ supercritical _ , characterized by positive lyapunov exponent ( thus non - uniform hyperbolicity ) 2 .   _ subcritical _ , characterized by the lyapunov exponent vanishing in a strip of complexified phases ( leading to almost - reducibility @xcite ) 3 .   _ critical _ , characterized as being neither of the two above .",
    "the first regime leads to anderson localization for a.e .",
    "frequency , and the second to absolutely continuous spectrum for all frequencies .",
    "various other interesting aspects of the first two regimes , each of which holds on an open set , are also well understood .",
    "the third regime , which is the boundary of the first two , can not support absolutely continuous spectrum @xcite but otherwise largely remains a mystery , even ( or especially ) in the most well studied case of the critical almost mathieu operator .",
    "even though measure - theoretically typical operators are acritical ( so have no critical energies in the spectrum ) @xcite , the most interesting / important operators from the point of view of physics turn out to be entirely critical , due to certain underlying symmetries ! for example , such are the extended harper s ( and also the original harper s ) model for the - most physically relevant - case of isotropic interactions .",
    "indeed , the duality transform , acting on the family of ( long - range ) quasiperiodic operators , often maps the first two regimes into each other , allowing for duality based conclusions , while mapping the third one into itself , making it self - dual and thus not allowing to use neither localization nor reducibility methods .    in this paper",
    "we provide the first mechanism for exclusion of point spectrum and thus proof of singular continuous spectrum in the _ critical _ regime that works for all frequencies and a.e .",
    "this allows us to prove singular continuity of the spectrum of extended harper s model through its entire critical regime , for all frequencies , describing spectral theory of the region that has resisted even heuristic explanations in physics literature .",
    "while our argument is specific for the extended harper s model , we believe that certain features of it will be extendable to the general critical case .",
    "a simple particular case of the argument proves singular continuity for the critical almost mathieu operator .",
    "we also are able to describe spectral theory of the extended harper s model for all other values of the couplings in its three - dimensional parameter space , largely by putting together the facts proved in several other recent papers .",

    "<S> the extended harper s model , proposed by d.j . thouless in 1983 , generalizes the famous almost mathieu operator , allowing for a wider range of lattice geometries ( parametrized by three _ coupling parameters _ ) by permitting 2d electrons to hop to both nearest and next nearest neighboring ( nnn ) lattice sites , while still exhibiting its characteristic symmetry ( aubry duality ) . </S>",
    "<S> previous understanding of the spectral theory of this model was restricted to two dual regions of the parameter space , one of which is characterized by the positivity of the lyapunov exponent . in this paper , we complete the picture with a description of the spectral measures over the entire remaining ( self - dual ) region , for all irrational values of the frequency parameter ( the magnetic flux in the model ) . </S>",
    "<S> most notably , we prove that in the entire interior of this regime , the model exhibits a collapse from purely ac spectrum to purely sc spectrum when the nnn interaction becomes symmetric . in physics literature , </S>",
    "<S> extensive numerical analysis had indicated such `` spectral collapse , '' however so far not even a heuristic argument for this phenomenon could be provided . on the other hand , in the remaining part of the self - dual region , </S>",
    "<S> the spectral measures are singular continuous irrespective of such symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis requires some rather delicate number theoretic estimates , which ultimately depend on the solution of a problem posed by erds and szekeres in @xcite . </S>"
