    "in the standard theory of big bang nucleosynthesis ( sbbn ) , given the number of light neutrino species , the abundances of these light elements depend only on one cosmological parameter , the baryon - to - photon number ratio @xmath4 , which in turn is directly related to the baryon density parameter @xmath5 , the present ratio of the baryon mass density to the critical density of the universe .",
    "this means that accurate measurements of the primordial abundances of each of the four light elements can provide , in principle , a direct measurement of the baryonic density . as @xmath4 is a very small quantity , it is convenient to define the parameter @xmath6 = 10@xmath7 @xmath4",
    ". then @xmath6 is related to @xmath5 by the expression @xmath6 = 274 @xmath8 , where @xmath9 = @xmath10/100 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 and @xmath10 is the present value of the hubble parameter @xcite .",
    "because of the strong dependence of its abundance on @xmath4 , deuterium has become the baryometer of choice ever since accurate measurement of d / h in high - redshift low - metallicity qso ly@xmath12 absorption systems have become possible .",
    "although the data is still scarce  there are only six absorption systems for which such a d / h measurement has been carried out @xcite  and the scatter remains large , the measurements appear to converge to a mean primordial value d / h @xmath13 2.4 @xmath3 0.4 @xmath14 10@xmath15 , which corresponds to @xmath8 @xmath13 0.023 @xmath3 0.002 .",
    "this estimate of @xmath8 is in excellent agreement with the values of 0.022  0.023 obtained from recent studies of the fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by dasi @xcite , boomerang @xcite and wmap @xcite .",
    "it is also in good agreement with the value of @xmath8 derived from large scale structure @xcite .",
    "while a single good baryometer like d is sufficient to derive the baryonic mass density from bbn , accurate measurements of the primordial abundances of at least two different relic elements are required to check the consistency of sbbn . among the remaining relic elements ,",
    "@xmath16he can only be observed in the solar system and in the galaxy , both of which have undergone significant chemical evolution , making it difficult to derive its primordial abundance @xcite .",
    "the derivation of the primordial @xmath17li abundance in metal - poor halo stars in the galaxy is also beset by difficulties such as the uncertain stellar temperature scale and the temperature structures of the atmospheres of these very cool stars @xcite .",
    "the primordial abundance of the remaining relic element , @xmath2he ( hereafter he ) , can in principle be derived accurately from observations of the helium and hydrogen emission lines from low - metallicity blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxies which have undergone little chemical evolution .",
    "several groups have used this technique to derive the primordial he mass fraction @xmath0 , with somewhat different results .",
    "our group @xcite has obtained @xmath0 = 0.244 @xmath3 0.002 .",
    "this value is consistent at the two - sigma level with the prediction of sbbn , @xmath0 = 0.2482 @xmath3 0.0007 @xcite , adopting the value of @xmath8 = 0.0223 @xmath3 0.0008 found by wmap @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath0 predicted by sbbn is not consistent with the lower values of 0.234 @xmath3 0.002 derived by @xcite , of 0.2384 @xmath3 0.0025 by @xcite and of 0.2391 @xmath3 0.0020 by @xcite .",
    "these lower estimates of @xmath0 have led some authors to argue that the discrepancy between the @xmath5s derived from @xmath0 and from d / h is a sign that sbbn is not valid @xcite and that new physics are required .",
    "although he is not a sensitive baryometer ( @xmath0 depends only logarithmically on the baryon density ) , its primordial abundance depends much more sensitively on the expansion rate of the universe and on a possible asymmetry between the numbers of neutrinos and anti - neutrinos in the early universe than d , @xmath16he or @xmath17li .",
    "this , because of two reasons : 1 ) a faster expansion would leave less time for neutrons to convert into protons , and the resulting higher neutron abundance would result in a higher @xmath0 , and 2 ) @xmath0 depends sensitively on the neutron to proton ratio , which depends in turn on the numbers of electron neutrinos and anti - neutrinos . in that sense , he is both a chronometer and/or leptometer which is very sensitive to any small deviation from sbbn , and hence to new physics , much more so than the other three primordial light elements @xcite .",
    "however , to detect small deviations from sbbn and make cosmological inferences , @xmath0 has to be determined to a level of accuracy of less than one percent .",
    "this is not an easy task .",
    "while it is relatively straightforward to derive the helium abundance in an h ii region with an accuracy of 10 percent if the spectrum is adequate , gaining one order of magnitude in the precision requires many conditions to be met .",
    "first , the observational data has to be of excellent quality .",
    "this has been the concern of our group @xcite .",
    "we have spent the last decade obtaining high signal - to - noise spectroscopic data of low - metallicity extragalactic h ii regions , and our sample includes now a total of 86 h ii regions in 77 galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this constitutes by far the largest sample of high - quality data reduced in a homogeneous way to investigate the problem of the primordial helium abundance . to put things in perspective ,",
    "the sample used in the pioneering work of @xcite comprised only 5 objects , with considerably larger observational errors .",
    "later , the sample of @xcite included 36 objects and that of @xcite 49 objects .",
    "with such a large observational sample at hand , it is now the general consensus that the accuracy of the determination of the primordial he abundance is limited presently , not so much by statistical uncertainties , but by our ability to account for systematic errors and biases .",
    "there are many known effects we need to correct for to transform the observed he i line intensities into a he abundance . neglecting or misestimating them may lead to systematic errors in the @xmath0 determination that are larger than the statistical errors .",
    "these effects are : ( 1 ) reddening , ( 2 ) underlying stellar absorption in the he i lines , ( 3 ) collisional excitation of the he i lines which make their intensities deviate from their recombination values , ( 4 ) fluorescence of the he i lines which also make their intensities deviate from their recombination values , ( 5 ) collisional excitation of the hydrogen lines ( hydrogen enters because the helium abundance is calculated relative to that of hydrogen ) , ( 6 ) possible departures from case b in the emissivities of h and he i lines , ( 7 ) the temperature structure of the h ii region and ( 8) its ionization structure .",
    "all these corrections are at a level of a few percent except for effect ( 3 ) that can be much higher , exceeding 10% in the case of the he i @xmath185876 emission line in hot and dense h ii regions .",
    "all effects , apart from ( 8) , influence each other in a complicated way . at the present time , we are far from a situation where all these corrections can be determined unambiguously from observational constraints and theory . given the complexity of h ii regions  they have very perturbed morphologies , possess complex velocity fields and a dust distribution difficult to quantify  the situation is not likely to be improved considerably in the near future .",
    "because of this , even if one were able to solve in an exact manner the radiation transfer in the case of a simple geometry , there is still a long way between a simple model and a real h ii region .",
    "effects ( 1 ) , ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) are relatively easy to account for empirically from the available spectroscopic information and have been already considered in the pioneering study of @xcite .",
    "corrections ( 2 ) and ( 5 ) have been discussed more recently @xcite .",
    "effect ( 7 ) has been the subject of many papers by peimbert and his coworkers .",
    "elemental abundance determinations are affected by biases in the presence of temperature inhomogeneities in the h ii regions . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have devised an empirical method to correct for this bias .",
    "however , this method relies on several assumptions that are not necessarily valid ( e.g. supposing that the temperature fluctuation parameter is the same in the high and low ionization regions , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the source of temperature inhomogeneities at the level invoked by peimbert and colleagues remains unidentified @xcite , unless they are supposed to result from abundance inhomogeneities ( * ? ? ?",
    "* stasiska et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "this is also why the computation of temperature corrections from photoionization models to derive he / h ( as proposed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is not necessarily relevant to real objects . to check for possible temperature fluctuations ,",
    "@xcite have compared the temperature in the o@xmath19 zone derived with the [ o iii ] @xmath184363 line , with that in the h@xmath20 zone derived with the balmer and paschen jumps in a large sample of hot low - metallicity h ii regions used in the determination of @xmath0 .",
    "they found that the two temperatures do not differ statistically , so that any temperature difference must be less than @xmath13 5% .",
    "effect ( 8) has first been corrected for using an empirical method @xcite , and has been later the subject of many papers based on photoionization modeling @xcite .",
    "effect ( 6 ) has been discussed for h ii regions by @xcite and @xcite , but has never been considered in the various estimates of @xmath0 thus far , case b having been assumed by all authors .    in the present determination of the primordial he abundance , we take into account all eight effects discussed above .",
    "we first use an empirical method to self - consistently account for effects 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 7 in the derivation of the abundance of he@xmath20 .",
    "this method has been detailed in @xcite , where it has been applied to a small sample of 7 objects .",
    "it was shown that taking all these effects into account in a systematic way can lead to helium abundances that are significantly higher than those obtained by @xcite for the same objects ( by up to 3% ) .",
    "here , we apply the same method , not only to our basic original sample of 93 h ii regions @xcite that we have assembled and observed ourselves ( hereafter the hebcd sample ) , but also to a different and larger sample of 271 extragalactic h ii regions selected from the data release 5 ( dr5 ) of the sloan digital sky survey ( hereafter the sdss sample ) .",
    "we then considered effects 6 and 8 on the derivation of the abundance of he in each h ii region and of the primordial he abundance .",
    "we describe the two hebcd and sdss samples in  [ sample ] . in  [ method ]",
    "we discuss the method used to derive he abundances in individual objects and the primordial he abundance from each sample . in ",
    "[ system ] , we discuss the systematic effects considered . our new best values for @xmath0 and the linear regression slope d@xmath21/d@xmath22 are presented in ",
    "[ primo ] .",
    "the cosmological implications of our new results are discussed in  [ cosmo ] .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in  [ summary ] .",
    "we determine @xmath0 and d@xmath21/d@xmath22 independently for two different samples . the hebcd sample ,",
    "is composed of 93 different observations of 86 h ii regions in 77 galaxies .",
    "the majority of these galaxies are low - metallicity bcd galaxies .",
    "this sample is essentially the same as the one described in @xcite , except that two close pairs of h ii regions in the spiral galaxy m10104@xmath23295 , dec ( j2000.0 ) = + 542347  and for the pair m101 no.3 + no.4 , r.a.(j2000.0 ) = 14@xmath2403@xmath23012 , dec ( j2000.0 ) = + 541429 . ]",
    "have been added .",
    "these four h ii regions were observed with the 6.5 m mmt on the night of 2004 february 20 .",
    "observations were made with the blue channel of the mmt spectrograph .",
    "we used a 2@xmath25@xmath14300@xmath25 slit and a 300 grooves / mm grating in first order . to remove the second - order contamination we use the l-38 blocking filter .",
    "the above instrumental set - up gave a spatial scale along the slit of 06 pixel@xmath11 , a scale perpendicular to the slit of 1.96  pixel@xmath11 , a spectral range 3600  7500  and a spectral resolution of 6  ( fwhm ) . the kitt peak irs spectroscopic standard star hz 44",
    "was observed for flux calibration .",
    "spectra of he - ar comparison arcs were obtained after each observation to calibrate the wavelength scale .",
    "the details of data reduction are described in @xcite and they are the same as those for other h ii regions from the hebcd sample . the two - dimensional spectra were bias subtracted and flat - field corrected using iraf .",
    "we then use the iraf software routines identify , reidentify , fitcoord , transform to perform wavelength calibration and correct for distortion and tilt for each frame .",
    "night sky subtraction was performed using the routine background .",
    "the level of night sky emission was determined from the closest regions to the galaxy that are free of galaxian stellar and nebular line emission , as well as of emission from foreground and background sources .",
    "one - dimensional spectra were then extracted from each two - dimensional frame using the apall routine . before extraction , distinct two - dimensional spectra of the same h ii region",
    "were carefully aligned using the spatial locations of the brightest part in each spectrum , so that spectra were extracted at the same positions in all subexposures .",
    "for all objects , we extracted the brightest part of the h ii region .",
    "we have summed the individual spectra from each subexposure after manual removal of the cosmic rays hits .",
    "the spectra obtained from each subexposure were also checked for cosmic rays hits at the location of strong emission lines , but none was found .",
    "particular attention was paid to the derivation of the sensitivity curve .",
    "it was obtained by fitting with a high - order polynomial the observed spectral energy distribution of the standard star hz 44 . because the spectrum of hz 44 has only a small number of a relatively weak absorption features , its spectral energy distribution is known with good accuracy of @xmath26 1% @xcite .",
    "moreover , the response function of the ccd detector is smooth , so we could derive a sensitivity curve with an accuracy better than 1% over the whole optical range .",
    "we show in tables [ tab5 ] and [ tab6 ] ( available only in electronic form ) , the emission line fluxes and the equivalent widths for these h ii regions , along with those of the remaining h ii regions in the hebcd sample .",
    "they were measured using the iraf splot routine .",
    "the line flux errors listed include statistical errors derived with splot from non - flux calibrated spectra , in addition to errors of 1% of the line fluxes introduced in the standard star absolute flux calibration .",
    "the line flux errors will be later propagated into the calculation of abundance errors .",
    "the number of data points ( 93 ) is larger than the number of h ii regions ( 86 ) because several h ii regions have independent observations from different telescopes .",
    "we treat these independent observations as separate data points in our least - square fitting . in assembling the above sample",
    ", we have taken care not to include objects that , for one reason or another , are not appropriate for he abundance determination , as described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in particular , the nw component of i zw 18 has not been included because its he i @xmath185876 emission line is strongly affected by the galactic interstellar na i @xmath185889,5895 absorption line .    the sdss sample , which we will use as a comparison sample , is composed of 271 low - metallicity h ii regions selected from the sdss dr5 .",
    "the sdss @xcite offers a gigantic data base of galaxies with well - defined selection criteria and observed in a homogeneous way .",
    "in addition , the spectral resolution is much better than that of most previous data bases on emission - line galaxies including all the spectra in the hebcd sample .",
    "it is possible to extract from the sdss data base a sample of emission - line galaxies with well - defined criteria . despite the lower quality of its data , this large comparison sample , observed and reduced in a different way , will allow us to check for possible systematic shifts in the linear regressions introduced by different data sets .",
    "its large size will also allow to check for other systematic effects .",
    "the sdss dr5 provides spectra of some 800000 galaxies , quasars and stars selected over a sky area of 4783 square degrees , in the wavelength range @xmath13 3800  9200 , along with tables of measured parameters from these data . from this data base accessible from the sdss web page ( http://www.sdss.org/dr5 ) , we have extracted flux - calibrated spectra of a total of 271 h ii regions which satisfy the following selection criteria : 1 ) the [ o iii ] @xmath184363 is detected at the level of @xmath27 2@xmath1 above the noise , allowing a direct heavy element abundance determination by the @xmath28 method , as was done for the h ii regions in the hebcd sample ; 2 ) the equivalent width of the h@xmath29 emission line ew(h@xmath29 ) is @xmath30 50 .",
    "this ensures that the effect of underlying he i stellar absorption on the derived he abundances is small ; 3 ) the observed flux of the h@xmath29 emission line @xmath31(h@xmath29 ) is @xmath30 10@xmath32 erg s@xmath11 @xmath33 .",
    "this condition ensures that the sdss sample contains only bright h ii regions with strong emission lines , the fluxes of which can be measured accurately .",
    "since the emission line [ o ii ] @xmath183727 in the sdss spectra of galaxies with @xmath34 @xmath26 0.02 is out of the observed spectral range , we have estimated its flux from the [ o ii ] @xmath187320 , 7330 emission line fluxes .",
    "the measurements of the emission line fluxes and the determination of the element abundances were done following the same procedures as for our basic hebcd sample .",
    "the observed emission line fluxes @xmath35/@xmath31(h@xmath29 ) and their equivalent widths ew(@xmath18 ) for all the objects in the two samples are shown respectively in tables [ tab5 ] and [ tab6 ] . because of their large sizes , these tables are available only in electronic form .",
    "emission line fluxes of all spectra , in both the hebcd and sdss samples , were measured using gaussian fitting with the iraf routine splot .",
    "the statistical errors of emission lines in the spectra of the hebcd sample are calculated using the photon statistics of the lines in the non - flux calibrated spectra . as for the sdss sample ,",
    "each spectrum in the sdss data base is supplemented by a file with the flux error in each pixel which can be used to calculate the errors of the emission lines in each spectra .",
    "the mean statistical errors are @xmath13 4% for the brightest he i @xmath185876 emission line , @xmath13 10% for the he i @xmath184471 and @xmath186678 emission lines , and @xmath13 13% for the he",
    "i @xmath18 7065 emission line , for the combined hebcd + sdss sample . as the mean statistical error of the weighted mean",
    "he abundance is primarily determined by the statistical error of the intensity of the brightest he i @xmath185876 emission line , we expect it to be @xmath13 3 - 4% , which is the case ( see table [ tab2 ] ) .    to check the reliability of error determinations for the emission lines in the spectra of our sample , we have considered the flux ratios of the two [ o i ] @xmath186363 and [ o i ] @xmath186300 lines .",
    "these flux ratios are plotted against oxygen abundance in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] where objects in the hebcd sample are shown by filled circles , and those in the sdss sample by open circles .",
    "the solid line shows the mean value of the flux ratio for the combined hebcd + sdss sample , and the dashed lines represent 1@xmath1 dispersions , @xmath13 17% of the mean value . since the theoretical value of the [ o i ] @xmath186363/@xmath186300 ratio is constant ( its value is @xmath13 1/3 ) and independent of physical conditions in the h ii region , the dispersion of the points around the mean in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] gives a good representation of the observational uncertainties .",
    "typically , the flux of [ o i ] @xmath186300 is comparable to the flux of he i @xmath184471 and @xmath186678 emission lines , with statistical errors of @xmath13 10% .",
    "the [ o i ] @xmath186363 is @xmath13 3 times weaker than the [ o i ] @xmath186300 line , so its error is @xmath13 17% .",
    "this is just the 1@xmath1 scatter found in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for the [ o i ] line flux ratio .",
    "we conclude that our estimates of the statistical errors for weak emission lines are reliable .",
    "the statistical errors in the emission lines intensities are then propagated in the calculation of errors in electron temperatures , electron number densities and element abundances .",
    "as in our previous work ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , we determine the primordial he mass fraction @xmath0 by fitting the data points in the @xmath21  o / h and @xmath21  n / h planes with linear regression lines of the form @xcite @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the he mass fraction , @xmath22 is the heavy element mass fraction , @xmath39 = ( @xmath40 + @xmath41)@xmath14@xmath42(he@xmath20+he@xmath19 ) is the he abundance , @xmath40 @xmath43 he@xmath20/h@xmath20 and @xmath41 @xmath43 he@xmath19/h@xmath20 are respectively the abundances of singly and doubly ionized he , and @xmath42(he@xmath20+he@xmath19 ) is the ionization correction factor for he . we have assumed @xmath22 = 18.2(o / h ) in eq .

    "its flux is @xmath92 2 times greater that of the he i @xmath184471 emission line and hence the effect of the underlying stellar absorption is also expected to be lower . however , the situation with this line is more complicated compared to other lines because of its blending with the hydrogen emission line h7 .",
    "we have presented our choice for the various ratios linking the absorption equivalent width of the he i @xmath184471 line to those of the other he i lines in our discussion of the basic set of parameters .",
    "while the choice of those ratios may appear arbitrary and is somewhat subjective since , with the exception of the @xmath184471 line , we do not have any guidance from observations or models concerning the equivalent widths of the he i absorption lines , we can estimate the effect of different adopted ew@xmath65 on @xmath0 . thus , assuming larger ew@xmath65 for the he i @xmath185876 , @xmath186678 and @xmath187065 lines , in the range 0.5  1.0 that of the @xmath184471 line , would result in a value of @xmath0 that can be as much as @xmath13 1% larger than the basic value . however , our calculations show that for the majority of the h ii regions , the @xmath93 values obtained with the larger ew@xmath65 for the @xmath185876 , @xmath186678 and @xmath187065 lines are @xmath13 2 times larger than the @xmath93 value obtained with the basic parameter set . additionally , the dispersion of the points in the @xmath21  o / h and @xmath21 ",

    "second , the ratio of the number of dust particles to the number of hydrogen atoms in our objects is more than one order of magnitude lower than the ratio in the interstellar medium of the galaxy , as shown by @xcite in their study of sdss extragalactic h ii regions . for low - metallicity h ii regions with these characteristics ,",

    "similar conclusions can be reached for helium .    as for case c which occurs when absorption of stellar photons at the wavelengths of lyman lines is important @xcite , our cloudy ( version c06.02 )",
    "calculations show that this situation does not happen in any significant degree in h ii regions such as the ones in our sample .    for the objects considered here , the effects of deviations from case b work in the same direction for both hydrogen and helium .",
    "since the determination of the he abundance involves the ratio of @xmath99(he ) to @xmath99(h ) , these effects partially compensate each other . in the present paper , we have chosen not to take into account the deviations from case b in the calculation of he abundances .",
    "accounting for them accurately would require a precise photoionization modeling for each individual object which is not feasible , given the large size of our sample .",

    "this sample is one of the largest and most homogeneous data sets in existence for the determination of @xmath0 . for comparison and to improve the statistics for investigating systematic effects in the determination of @xmath0 , we have also considered a sample of 271 low - metallicity h ii regions selected from the data release 5 of the sloan digital sky survey ( the sdss sample ) .    in the determination of @xmath0 ,",

    "we have also considered the effects of different sets of he i line emissivities and of different reddening laws .",
    "we discuss the effect of possible deviations of he i and h emission line intensities from case b.      \\1 .",
    "after the effect of collisional enhancement of the he i lines , the second most important systematic effect comes from underlying he i stellar absorption ( @xmath13 3% ) .",
    "other effects such as variations in temperature , collisional excitation of hydrogen emission lines or ionization corrections are smaller ( @xmath13 1% ) .",
    "because those systematic effects can work in either direction , either increasing or decreasing @xmath0 , they tend to cancel each other , so that the net effect of all the considered systematic effects is an increase of @xmath0 of @xmath13 2% as compared to the value derived by @xcite . with the old set of he",
    "i emissivities by @xcite used by @xcite , and with the electron temperature set , not to @xmath28(o iii ) , but to @xmath28(he@xmath20 ) , we derive @xmath0 = 0.2472@xmath30.0012 which , according to sbbn , corresponds to a baryonic mass fraction @xmath5@xmath103 = 0.020@xmath104 .",
    "this value of @xmath5@xmath103 is consistent with the ones derived from deuterium abundance observations and wmap microwave background radiation fluctuation measurements , and all three measurements concur to support the validity of the sbbn model ( sbbn predicts @xmath0 = 0.248 when @xmath5@xmath103 is set to the value derived by wmap , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we have checked that the derived @xmath0 does not depend on the particular sample of h ii regions used .",

    "if the new set of emissivities , based on updated he i atomic data , by @xcite is used , then we obtain @xmath0 = 0.2516@xmath30.0011 , corresponding to @xmath5@xmath103 = 0.032@xmath105 , significanly larger ( at the 2@xmath1 level ) than the @xmath5@xmath103 values derived from the deuterium abundance and microwave background radiation fluctuation measurements .",
    "if we take the higher value of @xmath0 at its face value , then this would imply the existence of small deviations from sbbn . in order to bring the high value of @xmath0 into agreement with the deuterium and wmap measurements",

    "however , the real situation may be more complicated .",
    "the most important issue that we do not yet fully understand appears to be the temperature structure of h ii regions .",

    "how much this affects the he / h abundance ratio , as well as the slope in the @xmath21 vs o / h relation is not known yet .",
    "finally , as suggested long ago by @xcite , very massive primordial stars may produce a significant amount of helium without overproducing metals , in which case the primordial helium abundance could be smaller than obtained from a linear extrapolation of the @xmath21 - o / h relation .",
