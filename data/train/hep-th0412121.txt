    "the non - linear gauge condition@xcite @xmath4 and its physical consequences has been discussed by this author in a number of papers . this gauge condition is a natural generalization in yang - mills theory of the coulomb gauge in abelian theory .",
    "the reasons for this claim are :    \\(a ) in the abelian limit , @xmath5 and since @xmath6 is positive definite , the gauge - condition yields the coulomb gauge .",
    "\\(b ) the gauge condition has two regimes , the linear regime given by @xmath7 , the coulomb gauge , and the non - linear regime defined by @xmath8 , which is also the zero mode of @xmath9 .",
    "thus the non - linear regime corresponds to the `` gribov '' horizon on the surface @xmath10 .",
    "\\(c ) the linear and non - linear regimes do not mix in the sense that field configurations in the non - linear regime can not be gauge transformed to the coulomb gauge and vice versa.@xcite    \\(d ) if we consider the running of the coupling constant , we find that for the short - distance regime where @xmath11 ( asymptotic freedom phase ) , the non - linear gauge reduces to @xmath12 , yielding the coulomb gauge because @xmath6 is positive definite .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that transverse gluons are physical degrees of freedom at short - distances .",
    "however , as we increase the distance scale , @xmath13 increases and before the running coupling becomes too large , where perturbation theory loses validity , the full non - linear character of the gauge condition becomes important where the relevant degrees of freedom are the scalars @xmath14 and the `` gluons '' @xmath15 , which decompose the yang - mills potential@xcite as @xmath16 this means that the non - linear gauge continuously interpolates short - distance and large distance physics with their corresponding degrees of freedom . since we consider quantum effects in the running of the coupling , the non - linear gauge is a quantum gauge condition .",
    "\\(e ) lastly , geometrically , configuration space analysis showed that non - linear gauge condition is a modification of the global orthogonal gauge condition , which does not exist in non - abelian theories and gives the coulomb gauge in abelian theory.@xcite    as for the physical consequences of the non - linear regime of the non - linear gauge , the following results had been established by the author :    \\(a ) the yang - mills action is quartic in @xmath1 and infinitely non - linear in @xmath17 .",
    "the pure @xmath17 action has a @xmath18 factor and its kinetic term goes like @xmath19 .",
    "clearly , these hint of non - perturbative physics.@xcite    \\(b ) the pure @xmath17 dynamic shows that all spherically symmetric @xmath20 with @xmath21 are classical configurations with zero field strength .",
    "the pure @xmath17 dynamics has a very broad minimum with zero action . because of the infinite degeneracy in classical configurations , the author proposed to treat @xmath22 as a stochastic variable with a white - noise distribution",
    "this resulted in the area law behaviour of the wilson loop , which means a linear potential for static sources.@xcite    \\(c ) if the stochastic treatment of the classical configuration @xmath20 yields a linear potential between static sources , full quantum dynamics of @xmath17 shows equivalence to an @xmath23 non - linear @xmath24 model in 2d.@xcite the proof made use of the parisi - sourlas mechanism.@xcite since the @xmath24 model is @xmath23 and not @xmath25 resulting in a kinetic term with a wrong sign , the proof of confinement is purely formal .",
    "furthermore , the proof of confinement only involves the scalars and not the `` gluons '' and quarks .",
    "\\(d ) when we consider the classical dynamics of the `` gluons '' in the spherically symmetric background @xmath20 , it was shown that stochastically averaging @xmath20 yielded a mass for the @xmath1 and the loss of its self - interactions.@xcite thus , we have shown the mechanism for the mass gap .",
    "as for the loss of self - interactions , the result was also arrived at by kondo.@xcite    \\(e ) finally , the author proposed the concept of limited gauge invariance and showed that in both the linear and non - linear regimes of the non - linear gauge we can define potentials that are gauge - invariant within their limited context.@xcite    in this paper , we will address the shortcomings noted in ( c ) by considering quarks and `` gluons '' in a stochastic background .",
    "we will decompose the scalar @xmath14 via @xmath26 we will note the subtleties in treating quantum and stochastic fluctuations . we will derive the effective action of quarks and `` gluons '' by averaging over the stochastic background .",
    "finally , we will derive a confining non - local four - fermi interaction .",
    "we will consider @xmath27 theory with the following action @xmath28 introducing the fadeev - popov trick of resolving unity using the gauge condition given by equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) , we find the vacuum to vacuum functional @xmath29 where @xmath30 note that in the linear regime , where the coupling @xmath13 is very weak and thus the smallest eigenvalue of the positive definite @xmath6 ( in @xmath31 ) is not lowered to zero , @xmath32 is still positive definite and the path - integral given by equation ( [ eq:5 ] ) reduces to the transverse gauge path - integral .",
    "as we further increase the coupling constant , we get to the gribov horizon of @xmath7 surface .",
    "we are still on the coulomb surface but the fadeev - popov operator is now singular . this regime had been discussed extensively in the late 1970 s and 1980s .",
    "the conjecture is that restricting the transverse gauge path - integral to within the central gribov region@xcite or the fundamental modular region results in confinement@xcite .",
    "this author has a different view : confinement happens in the next stage .    further increasing the distance scale , we get to the regime where transverse gluons should no longer be relevant degrees .",
    "the reasons for this are the existence of the mass gap ( massive vector fields are not transverse ) and the fact that it is essentially impossible to get a confining interaction from the exchange of transverse gluons .",
    "thus , we should be getting off the coulomb surface and the non - linear gauge seems to be a natural gauge to consider . here , we get to the gribov horizon of the @xmath8 surface where the zero mode of @xmath32 is @xmath33 itself .",
    "however , even though @xmath9 is singular , the corresponding operator @xmath34 given by equation ( [ eq:6 ] ) is non - singular@xcite .",
    "the path - integral is still well - defined , presenting no need to deal with zero modes .    in this non - linear regime",
