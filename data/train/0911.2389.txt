    "at one time there had been a wisdom claiming that the supersymmetry is the only candidate to solve the hierarchy problem without big tuning since the supersymmetry itself gives the beautiful cancelations between boson and fermion loops and makes these nervous quantum corrections mild . according to this wisdom",
    ", the cancelation is based on the opposite sign between boson and fermion loops in feynman rules . however , this kind of cancelation is not unique , that is to say , the possibility that particles with the same statistics can cancel each other s contribution under quantum corrections may exist .",
    "actually in the higgs loops of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) some diagrams among boson loops cancel each other s loop correction .",
    "recently one novel and different approach for solving the hierarchy problem was suggested by arkani - hamed , cohen and georgi @xcite .",
    "they revived the old idea that the higgs boson is a pseudo - goldstone boson from a spontaneous symmetry breaking of approximate global symmetry @xcite , and made one successful model called the littlest higgs model , which can protect the electroweak scale under quantum loop corrections . in their first successful model , unlike supersymmetric cases , there are only a few additional new gauge bosons and a vector - like top quark to cancel their corresponding one - loop corrections of the partners with the same statistics . this way to cure the harmful quadratic divergences of the squared higgs mass",
    "is surely more economical and simpler than that of the mssm which has many more free parameters .",
    "subsequently , many authors have been inspired by these attractive ideas , and have built various models  @xcite , which are largely classified by the breaking patterns of global symmetry .",
    "as soon as little higgs models had been introduced , these models also received a great attention from a different point of view besides the stability of the electroweak scale : cheng and low showed that these models can have a discrete symmetry called t - parity like the r - parity in the mssm @xcite , and this t - parity can also give a stable dark matter candidate by assigning the standard model ( sm ) fields to even and heavy new particles to odd parity , respectively .",
    "moreover , because the t - parity makes dangerous quantum corrections weak by prohibiting some vertices in feynman rules , it can make the little higgs models more consistent with severe electroweak precision constraints than before .",
    "however , although the t - parity has good advantages , lately hill and hill @xcite showed that the t - parity can suffer from anomalies and be broken because of oddness of wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) term under t - parity .",
    "this term contains information of anomaly physics of a given theory in the lagrangian .    in this letter",
    "we thus introduce a new discrete @xmath2 symmetry called z - parity .",
    "this new parity generally comes from a residual discrete gauge symmetry of an additional @xmath0 gauge group  @xcite . in order to realize z - parity we must simultaneously consider the anomaly - free conditions for the extended gauge groups as well as for the relevant yukawa terms . as a specific example , we choose the minimal little higgs model called mini little higgs model ( mlh )  @xcite , only because of the simplicity of the gauge structure @xmath3 .",
    "we extend mlh and show how to realize z - parity .",
    "we also show that z - parity odd particles are right - handed majorana particles , and there exist at least two z - parity odd particles in the minimally extended model , therefore , the lightest z - parity odd particle can be a viable dark matter candidate .",
    "it is also interesting that , as shown in table 3 , the charge assignments of z - parity odd particles show @xmath2 symmetries between @xmath4 and @xmath5 , as well as among particles in each @xmath0 charge .",
    "especially , these z - parity odd particles can interact only with the @xmath6 gauge boson and scalar particles .",
    "in addition , we investigate the allowed regions of the parameters which satisfy the current relic density of the cold dark matter , and find very narrow allowed regions .",
    "it is important that there exists an upper bound of the global symmetry breaking scale , @xmath7 tev , depending on the dark matter mass ( see fig .",
    "we also show that the mass of top partner @xmath8 can not be larger than around 3 tev by using the constraint of @xmath1 value and , therefore , the range of the mass of @xmath8 is about @xmath9 tev ( see fig .",
    "* a. aspects of the mini little higgs model *    mlh is based on the @xmath10 gauge symmetry , and an approximate @xmath11 global symmetry which is broken to @xmath12 .",
    "it is important to notice that these @xmath0 charge assignments , which protect the squared mass of the higgs particle from radiative quantum corrections of charged weak gauge bosons @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the sm , are necessary ingredients in mlh because of the absence of new charged particles .",
    "these heavy charged partners generally cancel the quantum corrections of the @xmath15 in usual little higgs spirit .",
    "( note that there is no additional @xmath16 gauge group in mlh . ) however , because of the simplicity of the gauge structure we can easily obtain simple anomaly - free constraint equations for each @xmath0 charge assignment and extend the model to have the new residual discrete gauge symmetry .",
    "we call this parity z - parity from now on .",
    "now we briefly present the lagrangian for the original mlh , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a triplet of the global @xmath11 and decomposed into an @xmath19 doublet @xmath20 and an @xmath19 singlet @xmath21 as @xmath22 .",
    "the second line describes the usual yukawa terms plus the coupling term of the right - handed neutrino @xmath23 for the see - saw mechanism , and the third line presents the mixing between the top quark and heavy top partner @xmath24 .",
    "note that the existence of the same coupling @xmath25 for the first terms of the second and third lines , and the coupling @xmath26 for the additional colored vector - like quark @xmath27 , are necessary to cancel the dangerous top loop corrections to the higgs @xmath28 field .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details of mlh . )",
    ".examples of anomaly - free @xmath4 and @xmath5 charge assignments for @xmath29 ( upper two rows ) and @xmath30 cases ( bottom two rows ) where @xmath31 is a @xmath32 charge for @xmath33 and @xmath34 is a @xmath32 charge for @xmath20 and we assume that @xmath35 , which is a @xmath32 charge for singlet @xmath21 , is @xmath36 . in order to get @xmath37 charge assignments we use hypercharge relation @xmath38 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we summarize all important anomalies in table 6 , and divide all these anomalies into three classes ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) . here",
    "s are the anomalies involving @xmath4 only .",
    "similarly @xmath43 s denote the anomalies involving @xmath5 only .",
    "the mixed anomalies between these @xmath4 and @xmath5 are denoted by @xmath44 s .",
    "now we consider the solution sets of the @xmath0 charges . in mlh",
    "we have 18 unknown parameters such as @xmath45 $ ] , where @xmath46 .",
    "there are also @xmath47 constraints @xmath48 5 yukawa constraints ( @xmath49 ) per each @xmath0 , where subscripts denote up , down , electron , right - handed neutrino and the singlet @xmath21 , respectively",
    ". moreover , there are 9 hypercharge relations and 10 anomaly conditions ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "therefore , the number of constraints is larger than that of unknown parameters .",
    "however , all these constraints are not completely independent .",
    "for instance , anomaly conditions @xmath51 and @xmath52 give the constraint equations which are the same as yukawa constraints given above . in order to find the solutions of the valid charges for @xmath4 and @xmath5 efficiently , it would be better to use hypercharge relations first .",
    "these 9 hypercharge relations reduce our original 18 unknown parameters to 9 unknown parameters , and simplify two ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) anomaly cancelation conditions by adding and subtracting these two conditions .",
    "then , we can show that these two nonlinear equations become simpler , @xmath55 @xmath56 since 5 yukawa constraints and @xmath57 give a total of 6 linear constraints for 9 unknown parameters for the @xmath5 sector , three parameters still remain to be unknown .",
    "therefore , general solution sets of @xmath5 are given by @xmath58\\\\ z_{2}[t_{r } ] \\\\",
    "z_{2}[b_{r } ] \\\\",
    "z_{2}[e_{l } ] \\\\",

    "it is interesting that these general solution sets automatically satisfy remaining constraints , quadratic @xmath62 , @xmath63 and cubic @xmath64 .",
