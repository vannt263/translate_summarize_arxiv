    "although at present there are no known fundamental scalar particles in nature , scalar fields play an important role in physics and cosmology . in physics , scalar fields are present in jordan - brans - dicke theory as jordan - brans - dicke scalar @xcite ; in kaluza - klein compactification theory as the radion @xcite , in the standard model of particle physics as the higgs boson @xcite , in the low - energy limit of the superstring theory as the dilaton @xcite or tachyon @xcite and so on . in cosmology ,",
    "scalar fields are present as the inflaton @xcite to drive the inflation of the early universe and currently as the quintessence or phantom @xcite fields , driving the acceleration the universe .    in general ,",
    "the action of scalar - tensor theories of gravity are given by @xmath0\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the scalar field , @xmath2 the scalar potential and @xmath3 the ricci scalar . here",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 are arbitrary functions of the corresponding variables .",
    "these theories cover the @xmath6 modified gravity @xcite , the gauss - bonnet gravity @xcite , the quintessence scalar , the phantom scalar , the quintom fields @xcite , the k - essence scalar theory @xcite , the tachyon , dilaton , and so on .",
    "we note that these theories have already been investigated extensively .    on the contrary , to our knowledge , the even more general scalar tensor theories of gravity such as @xmath7\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are",
    "has not been so well investigated . the new coupling between the derivative of scalar and the spacetime curvature may appear in some kaluza - klein theories @xcite . in 1993 , amendola @xcite studied the scalar - tensor theory with the lagrangian linear in the ricci scalar @xmath3 , quadratic in @xmath1 , and containing terms as follows : @xmath8 amendola @xcite investigated a cosmological model with the only derivative coupling term @xmath9 and presented some analytical inflationary solutions . a general model containing @xmath10 and @xmath9 has been discussed by capozziello et al . , @xcite",
    "they showed that the de sitter spacetime is an attractor solution in the model . in 2007 , daniel and caldwell @xcite studied a theory with the derivative coupling term of @xmath9 and found the constraints on the coupling parameter with solar system tests .    in general ,",
    "these scalar - tensor theories give both the einstein equations and the equation of motion for the scalar in the form of fourth - order differential equations .",
    "however , recently sushkov @xcite showed that in the case of the kinetic term only coupled to the einstein tensor , the equation of motion for the scalar is reduced to second order .",
    "thus , from the point of view of physics , this theory can be interpreted as a `` good '' theory .",
    "the reason for this is very simple .",
    "it is well understood that tensors constructed from the metric tensor and its derivatives ( up to second order ) , only the metric tenor @xmath11 and the einstein tensor @xmath12 are divergence free : @xmath13 therefore for the lagrangian @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 constants , the equation of motion takes the form of @xmath17 which is a second order differential equation .    in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the cosmic evolution of a scalar field with the kinetic term coupled to more than one einstein tensor .",
    "we find this scalar field presents us with two very interesting characteristics .",
    "when the kinetic term is coupled to only one einstein tensor , and in the absence of any other matter sources or in the presence of only pressureless matter , the scalar behaves exactly as the pressureless matter .",
    "thus it could be a candidate for cold dark matter .",
    "on the other hand , when the kinetic term is coupled to more than one einstein tensor , the scalar field can have the equation of state @xmath18 over the whole history of the universe .",
    "therefore , the scalar field can play the role of a dynamic cosmological constant .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we shall investigate the cosmic evolution of the scalar with the kinetic term coupled to one einstein tensor .",
    "we find it to be a possible candidate for either cold dark matter or both cold dark matter and dark energy . in section iii",
    ", we investigate the cosmic evolution of the scalar with the kinetic term coupled to more than one einstein tensor .",
    "section iv gives the conclusions and discussion .",
    "we shall use the system of units with @xmath19 and the metric signature @xmath20 throughout the paper .",
    "the lagrangian density of quintessence - phantom ( or quintom ) is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the metric tensor . here",
    "@xmath23 corresponds to quintessence and @xmath24 to a phantom field .",
    "let s investigate the scalar field with the lagrangian density as follows @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the einstein tensor .",
    "@xmath16 is assumed to be a positive constant .",
    "we note that differently from quintessence or phantom fields , the kinetic term of this scalar field is coupled not to the metric tensor , but to the einstein tensor .",
    "this modification leads to the scalar field behaving as the einstein cosmological constant in minkowski spacetime due to the fact that @xmath27 .",
    "then from the action @xmath28 we obtain the einstein equations @xmath29\\big\\}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the equation of motion for the scalar @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the energy - momentum tensor for the matter fields derived from the action @xmath32 .",

    ", we investigate whether the scalar can be a cdm candidate .",
    "consider a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the scale factor .",
    "we model all other matter sources present in the universe as perfect fluids .",
    "these matter sources can be baryonic matter , relativistic matter and dark energy .",
    "we assume there is no interaction between the scalar field and other matter fields , other than by gravity",
    ". then the einstein equations are given by    @xmath40\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we define @xmath41 where @xmath42 are the energy density and pressure of the i - th matter .    the equation of motion for the scalar can be derived from above einstein equations eqs .  ( 18 ) or from its equation of motion eq .",
    "( 12 ) as follows @xmath43 from which we obtain @xmath44 where @xmath45 is an integration constant",
    ". so the energy density of the scalar is @xmath46 the equation reveals that : in the stiff matter dominated universe , namely @xmath47 , the density of the scalar is nearly a constant ; in the relativistic matter dominated universe , namely @xmath48 , the energy density of the scalar scales as @xmath49 and the scalar has the equation of state @xmath50 just like the curvature term ; in the baryon matter dominated universe , namely @xmath51 , the scalar field behaves as pressureless matter ; in the cosmological constant dominated universe , namely @xmath52 , the energy density of the scalar scales as @xmath53 and so has the equation of state @xmath54 .",
    "now we have a friedmann equation as follows @xmath55 by setting @xmath56 the friedmann equation can be rewritten as @xmath57 the energy density of the scalar turns out to be    @xmath58    we conclude that , in the absence of all other matter ( @xmath59 ) or in the presence of baryonic matter ( @xmath60 ) , the scalar behaves exactly as pressureless dark matter with @xmath61 .",
    "this enables us to propose this scalar field as a candidate for dark matter . assuming that the energy density of the other matter fields is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 are the present - day energy density of relativistic matter and baryon , respectively , and @xmath64 is the einstein cosmological constant .",
    "then the pressure and the equation of state for the scalar take the form of @xmath65    @xmath66    we see again the scalar behaves exactly as pressureless matter in the presence of only baryon matter .",
    "let @xmath67 denote the present - day energy density of the universe .",

    "further more , the sound speed of the scalar perturbations is exactly zero in the structure formation era .",
    "these properties enable the scalar to be a potential candidate for cold dark matter .",
    "secondly , in the presence of a scalar potential , the scalar field has the equation of state @xmath103 .",
    "so the scalar may play the role of both cold dark matter and dark energy .",
    "it is found the sound speed is always smaller than the speed of light , and so it is physically viable . by investigating the dynamics of the scalar field in the absence of other matter sources , we find it can cross the phantom divide .",
    "but it may be physically forbidden due to the presence of a superluminal sound speed . finally , if the kinetic term is coupled to more than one einstein tensors , the equation of state is always approximately equals to @xmath104 whether the potential is flat or not .",
