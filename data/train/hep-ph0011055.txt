    "the origin of the baryon asymmetry of the universe is one of the most important open questions in cosmology and particle physics .",
    "it has been long understood that , in order to generate the observed baryon asymmetry , three requirements  @xcite need to be fulfilled : the non - conservation of baryon number , cp - violation and the existence of non - equilibrium processes  @xcite .",

    "baryon number violation is induced by anomalous  @xcite sphaleron processes  @xcite , which are suppressed at zero temperature , but whose rate grows linearly with the temperature above @xmath13 .",
    "the non - conservation of cp is an essential property of the standard model , and non - equilibrium processes may be obtained through the expansion of bubbles of true vacuum , which occurs after the electroweak phase transition .    in spite of fulfilling all the desired properties",
    ", the rate of the cp - violating processes in the standard model ( sm ) is too small to induce the required baryon asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the preservation of the generated baryon asymmetry after the electroweak phase transition requires a strongly first order phase transition  , with @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the higgs vacuum expectation value at the critical temperature @xmath12 . for the experimentally allowed values of the higgs mass ,",
    "this requirement is not fulfilled in the standard model  @xcite .",

    "@xcite in two main aspects . on the one hand , instead of computing the temporal component of the current in the lowest order of higgs background insertions",
    ", we compute all current components by performing a resummation of the higgs mass insertion contributions to all order in perturbation theory .",
    "the resummation is essential since it leads to a proper regularization of the resonant contribution to the temporal component of the current found in ref .",

    "the bubble wall is assumed to be located at the space - time point @xmath31 , where there is a non - trivial background of the mssm higgs fields , @xmath32 , which carries dimensionful cp - violating couplings to the left- and right - handed stops .",

    "more interesting , a slight excess of events , about 3 standard deviations above the sm predictions , has been observed , consistent with a sm like higgs in the range of masses of about 113116 gev .",
    "the present higgs mass constraints become particularly relevant for small values of @xmath5 , @xmath324  5 . in this case , due to the behaviour of the higgs boson couplings to fermions and gauge bosons , the sm higgs mass constraints translate with almost no variations into a bound on the lightest cp - even higgs boson mass  . a more general analysis , similar to the one performed in refs .",
    "@xcite would be appropriate to consider more general cp - violating effects . ] . for values of @xmath14 and @xmath325 , and for left - handed",
    "stop masses smaller than @xmath21 3 tev , the lightest cp - even higgs mass never exceeds 105 gev . therefore , the mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis demands either values of @xmath326 or unnaturally large values of @xmath22  .",
    "large values of @xmath5 move the value of the higgs boson mass , with relevant couplings to the gauge bosons , to larger values .",
    "however , if the values of the left - handed stop parameters are restricted to be below 3 tev , for @xmath14 , the higgs mass can not exceed 115 gev .",
    "observe that these values are a few gev higher than those obtained previously in ref .",
    "@xcite , since in that reference we restricted ourselves to the case of left - handed stop masses below 1 tev",

    "let us stress that at large values of @xmath5 the coupling of this higgs boson to bottom quarks can be significantly lower than in the sm  @xcite with a corresponding reduction of the higgs mass bound .",
    "these variations can only occur for small values of the cp - odd higgs mass @xmath279 , of order of the lightest cp - even higgs boson mass .",
    "unlike the case of small values of @xmath5 , for values of @xmath329 , the values of @xmath330 are only weakly dependent on the exact value of @xmath279 .",
    "intuitively , this can be understood by the fact that for large values of @xmath5 , the cp - odd higgs can be approximately identified with the imaginary part of the neutral component of the higgs doublet @xmath188 , while the higgs doublet which acquires vacuum expectation value is mainly @xmath331 ( @xmath332 .    for the values of @xmath94 and @xmath24",
    "consistent with electroweak baryogenesis , a reduction of the coupling of the cp - even higgs boson to the bottom quark would demand not only small values of @xmath333150 gev , but also large values of @xmath329 and of @xmath334 ( the larger @xmath5 , the easier suppressed values of the bottom quark coupling are obtained ) .",
    "we have checked that , assuming small cp - violating effects in the higgs potential and in the higgs - fermion couplings , and for values of @xmath335 tev , @xmath14 and @xmath336 gev , a significant reduction of the coupling of the higgs to bottom quarks only occur for @xmath337 .",
    "therefore , if the excess of events observed at lep is not associated with a higgs signal , strong constraints on the electroweak baryogenesis scenario within the mssm will be obtained .",
    "in this article , we have performed a computation of the scalar- and fermion- cp - violating currents induced by the expansion of a true - vacuum bubble in the false vacuum plasma , within the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model .",
    "we made use of the keldysh formalism and we have defined a systematic way of obtaining the currents in an expansion of derivatives of the higgs fields , to all orders of the higgs background insertions .",
    "although our method is similar to the one previously used by some of us in ref .",
    "@xcite , our results differ from those presented in our previous work in several respects .",
    "first of all , they include a resummation of corrections associated with higher order of the higgs background insertions .",
    "these corrections have two important effects .",
    "the first one is to dilute the resonant behaviour obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for values of @xmath338 .",
    "the second one is the appearance of a contribution proportional to @xmath339 to the vector higgsino current @xmath340 .",
    "this means that , as first observed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the vector higgsino current does not vanish for large values of the cp - odd higgs mass .",
    "our method provides a way of obtaining the value of this non - vanishing contribution in a self - consistent way .",
    "in addition , we have also computed the axial higgsino current @xmath341 , whose components are proportional to @xmath342 . therefore , as first observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the chiral current is not suppressed for large values of the cp - odd higgs mass and hence may become relevant in this regime .",
    "the vector and axial higgsino currents , @xmath343 , were used to determine the baryon asymmetry of the universe , @xmath314 . the computation of @xmath295 demands the solution of diffusion equations , with sources determined through @xmath343 . following the method developed in refs .",
    "@xcite , we assumed that the sources are proportional to the temporal component of the currents , with a constant of proportionality given by the higgsino width .",
    "within this approximation , we computed the functional dependence of @xmath295 on the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters and on the bubble wall parameters .",
    "the most important parameters turn out to be the gaugino and higgsino mass parameters , @xmath344 and @xmath140 , their relative phase arg@xmath345 , ( equal to @xmath346 in the basis in which @xmath140 is real ) as well as the cp - odd higgs mass @xmath279 and @xmath5 .",
    "we have also required that the condition of preservation of the baryon asymmetry @xmath14 is fulfilled , what demands a light right - handed stop and , due to the present higgs mass constraints coming from lep ( see section [ higgs ] ) , also large values of the ratio of higgs vacuum expectation values , @xmath347 .    under the above conditions , we have determined the value of @xmath295 , compared to the value predicted by big bang nucleosynthesis , for a value of @xmath348 1 .",
    "the ratio of the theoretically obtained to the bbn predicted baryon asymmetry can be reinterpreted as the inverse of the value of @xmath349 needed to obtain a value of @xmath295 in agreement with the bbn predictions .",
    "we conclude that , for small values of @xmath333 gev and @xmath350 , values as low as @xmath351 can lead to acceptable values of @xmath295 . the predicted value of the phase @xmath346 increases for larger values of @xmath279 and/or for @xmath352 , but still there is a large fraction of parameter space in which the computed baryon number is in good agreement with bbn predictions , for phases such that @xmath3531 .",
    "values of @xmath354 can lead to acceptable phenomenology if either peculiar cancellations in the squark and slepton contributions to the neutron and electron electric dipole moments ( edm ) occur  @xcite , and/or if the first and second generation of squarks are heavy  @xcite .",
    "this second possibility is quite appealing and , as has been recently demonstrated  @xcite , leads to acceptable phenomenology , including the dark matter constraints  , although they tend to be suppressed for small values of the mixing in the stop sector , as the ones required for electroweak baryogenesis . ] .",
    "another important observable which , similarly to the value of the baryon number , depends on the precise value of the mass parameters in the gaugino , higgsino and third generation squark sectors , as well as on the charged higgs mass , is the rate of the rare decay @xmath355  @xcite . for small values of the charged higgs and",
    "stop masses , and for moderate values of @xmath356 and @xmath357 , the chargino - stop contribution , as well as the charged higgs contribution , may become large for large values of @xmath5  @xcite . in scenarios with heavy first and second generation squarks ,",
    "however , flavor violation couplings involving the third generation squarks could be non - negligible  @xcite and therefore the gluino - sbottom contributions to this rare decay rate may be enhanced  @xcite . since these last contributions are strongly model dependent , and may be larger than the charged higgs and chargino - stop ones , we have not imposed the @xmath355 constraints in our analysis .",
    "finally , we have discussed the effect of the higgs mass constraints coming from lep .",
    "the preliminary data coming from the lep experiments imply a lower bound on the mass of a sm - like higgs boson of about 113 gev . a small excess , consistent with a sm - like higgs boson with a mass slightly above that value has also been observed .",
    "these relatively large values of the higgs mass are consistent with electroweak baryogenesis within the mssm if the value of @xmath5 is large , @xmath326 , if the left - handed stops are heavy @xmath358 tev , and if the stop mixing parameter is not small , @xmath359 . on the other hand , for these values of the higgs mass ,",
    "values of @xmath360 make the phase transition weaker , leading to values of @xmath330 that are in conflict with the condition of preservation of the baryon asymmetry .",
    "it is important to emphasize , however , that even if the cp - even higgs boson coupling to the gauge boson is sm like , it can evade the lep bounds if its coupling to the bottom quark is strongly suppressed , what can occur for very large values of @xmath5 , @xmath337 .",
    "more relevantly , if the excess of events at lep has its origins in the presence of a sm - like higgs boson of mass of about 113115 gev , one of the predictions of electroweak baryogenesis , namely the presence of a light neutral higgs boson with sm - like couplings to the gauge bosons and a mass not larger than 115 gev would have been fulfilled .",

    "<S> in this work we compute the cp - violating currents of the right - handed stops and higgsinos , induced by the presence of non - trivial vacuum expectation values of the higgs fields within the context of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) with explicit cp - violating phases . using the keldysh formalism </S>",
    "<S> , we perform the computation of the currents at finite temperature , in an expansion of derivatives of the higgs fields . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to previous works , we implement a resummation of the higgs mass insertion effects to all orders in perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> while the components of the right - handed stop current @xmath0 become proportional to the difference @xmath1 ( suppressed by @xmath2 ) , the higgsino currents , @xmath3 present contributions proportional to both @xmath4 . for large values of the charged higgs mass and moderate values of @xmath5 </S>",
