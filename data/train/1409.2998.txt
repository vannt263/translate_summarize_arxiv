    "totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) is one of the simplest models of non - equilibrium systems of interacting self - driven particles @xcite .",
    "properties of tasep and its various extensions have been analyzed to get insight into the spatio - temporal organization in wide varieties of physical and biological systems @xcite . in the simplest version of this",
    "model particles hop forward , with rate @xmath0 , from one site to the next on a one - dimensional lattice of equi - spaced sites ; however , a particle successfully executes the forward hop if , and only if , the target site is empty .",
    "effects of two types of quenched ( time - independent ) defects on the spatio - temporal organization of the particles have been explored extensively @xcite .",
    "( a ) in one class of models of quenched defect the randomness is associated with the _ lattice _ : particles hop at the rate @xmath0 from all sites except from the `` point defect '' from where the hopping rate is @xmath1",
    ". such a single defect site can give rise a nontrivial macroscopic phase segregation of the particles into high - density and low - density regions @xcite .",
    "two types of extensions of this model have been reported : ( i ) @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) successive sites are occupied by defects so that the defect may be regarded as a single extended object of length @xmath2 ; ( ii ) @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) point defects are distributed randomly over the entire lattice @xcite so that the lattice can be viewed as `` disordered '' rather than merely defective . in the latter case",
    "time - independent random hopping rates , drawn from a probability distribution @xmath4 , are assigned to each lattice site . from now",
    "onwards we refer to this class of models as random - site tasep ( rst ) .",
    "( b ) in the second class of models with quenched defect , the randomness is associated with the particles : a single `` impurity '' particle is allowed to hop at a rate @xmath1 whereas the hopping rate of all the other particles is @xmath0 .",
    "the growth of platoons of particles behind the impurity is reminiscent of coarsening phenomena and the steady state of the system can be expressed formally in terms of a bose - einstein - like condensate of the vacancies ( absence of particles ) in front of the impurity particle @xcite . in the more general version of this model the particles",
    "are assigned time - independent hopping rates randomly drawn from a probability distribution @xcite . from now",
    "onwards we refer to this class of models as random - particle tasep ( rpt ) .",
    "in this paper we introduce a biologically - motivated quasi - one dimensional tasep with two parallel tracks of lattice sites .",
    "although the particles are not allowed to shift from one track to the other , the flow in each influences that in the other through a prescription that we define in the next section",
    ". we shall refer to this model as tasep with mobile bottlenecks ( tmb ) .",
    "as we ll explain in the next section , in one special limit this tmb reduces to rst .",
    "we also indicate possible extensions of the model for potential applications in traffic - like collective phenomena in biological systems . using a combination of approximate analytical arguments and highly accurate numerical simulations , we demonstrate the rich varieties of spatio - temporal organizations , including phase segregations , in this model .",
    "dynamic blockage against directed ( albeit stochastic ) movement of proteins and macromolecular complexes along filamentous tracks is well known @xcite . for example , a class of molecular motors walk along the surface of stiff tubular filaments called microtubules @xcite .",
    "microtubule - associated proteins , which act as blockage against the forward stepping of these motors , can detach from the microtubule thereby opening up the blockage . similarly , several different types of molecular motors that walk along dna or rna strands face hindrance caused by proteins bound to the respective tracks @xcite .",
    "often these bound proteins either slide along the same track diffusively or , occasionally , detach from the track itself . thus ,",
    "most of the blockages against the movement of molecular motors are dynamic in nature .",
    "our generic model here has been motivated by molecular motor traffic on dna strands @xcite which began receiving serious attention after brewer @xcite summarized the earlier experimental observations scattered in the literature . during dna replication , the replication machine , called dna polymerase ( dnap )",
    "moves along one of the two strands of a double - stranded dna that serves as its track . during the same period another class of machines , called rna polymerase ( rnap )",
    "transcribes the dna .",
    "often a dnap and a rnap approach each other head - on along the two strands of the double stranded dna . because of the close proximity of the two tracks , each acts as a dynamic blockage for the other . the model developed here",
    "is motivated by such traffic - like collective movement of particles on two parallel tracks ( see fig.[fig - model ] ) .",
    "and @xmath5 per unit time in the absence and presence , respectively , of any hindering particle on the inner track .",
    "similarly , the particles , also represented by the black discs , on the inner lane hop with the probabilities @xmath6 and @xmath7 per unit time in the absence and presence , respectively , of any hindering particle on the outer track .",
    "no more than one particle can occupy the same site simultaneously .",
    "in one version the particles in both the tracks move counterclockwise whereas in the other version only the particles in the outer track move counter - clockwise while those in the inner track move clockwise ( as shown in this figure ) . ]",
    "our model is shown schematically in fig.[fig - model ] .",
    "it consists of two square tracks with a common center where the outer and inner tracks are labelled by the symbols @xmath8 ( outer ) and @xmath9 ( inner ) , respectively .",
    "each track consists of equi - spaced discrete sites ; the lengths of the outer and inner tracks , denoted by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , are the total number of sites of the respective tracks .",
    "particles on both tracks have identical size and each covers @xmath2 consecutive lattice sites simultaneously ( for @xmath12 , it might be more appropriate to regard these particles as hard rods ) .",
    "the number of particles on @xmath9 and @xmath8 are @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively ; the corresponding _ number densities _ being @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "we also define the _ coverage densities _ @xmath17 and @xmath18 ; for @xmath19 , coverage densities are identical to the corresponding particle densities .",
    "just as in tasep the particles hop forward by one single lattice spacing ( i.e. , from one lattice site to the next on the same track ) provided the target site is not covered by the leading particle . in the outer and inner tracks the hopping rates are @xmath20 and @xmath6 , respectively provided the adjacent site on the other track is not covered by a particle ; however , if the adjacent site on the other track is covered by a particle , the hopping is possible at the corresponding reduced rates @xmath5 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "thus , as we mentioned in the introduction , flow in the two tracks are affected by the mutual hindrance although no direct transfer of particles from one track to the other is allowed .",
    "we have studied both co - directional traffic and counter - moving traffic in the two tracks .",
    "in the following subsections , where ever possible , we provide theoretical estimates of the quantities of our interest based on either mean - field approximation or heuristic arguments .",
    "we also compute these quantities numerically by carrying out computer simulations . in order to ensure that the data are collected , indeed , in the steady state of the system we discard the data for the first _ five million _ time steps . throughout this paper",
    "we consider the limits @xmath21 .",
    "so far as the inner track is concerned , we ll pay special attention to the two limits @xmath22 and @xmath23 , in addition to more general cases .",
    "our primary interest will be the flux @xmath24 in the outer track although we ll also present the results for the inner track .",
    "the three main characteristic parameters of the inner track that control the nature of the flux @xmath25 in the outer track are ( i ) the length @xmath26 , ( ii ) the density @xmath27 , and ( iii ) @xmath5 which is a measure of the strength of the hindrance created by the inner - track particles for the outer - track flow ( and , vice - versa ) .      in order to test the validity and accuracy of the approximate analytical expressions that we derive here for @xmath25 and @xmath29",
    ", we also collect corresponding numerical data by direct computer simulations of the model . the chosen parameter values @xmath30 and @xmath31 not only ensure that the tracks are sufficiently long but also allow minimal difference in the lengths of the two tracks preserving their square shapes .",
    "@xmath32 denotes the probability of finding a particle at site @xmath33 on @xmath9 ( the inner track ) .",
    "similarly @xmath34 is the probability of finding a particle at site @xmath35 on @xmath8 ( the outer track ) .",
    "first we consider the simpler case of @xmath19 . in the mean - field approximation ,",
    "the master equations for the probabilities @xmath36 and @xmath32 are given by @xmath37~p^{(o)}_{j-1}(1-p^{(o)}_{j } ) \\nonumber \\\\                                & - & [ q^{(o)}(1-p^{(i)}_{j})+q^{(o)}p^{(i)}_{j}]p^{(o)}_{j}(1-p^{(o)}_{j+1 } ) .",

    "static _ defects on the track .",
    "if @xmath52 consecutive lattice sites are occupied by static defects and have defect - free sites at the two neighboring sites at the two ends of these @xmath52 sites , the @xmath52-site `` cluster '' acts a single bottleneck of length @xmath52 . from the distribution of the lengths of such bottlenecks created by the independently distributed random defects",
    "one can calculate the size @xmath53 of the longest bottleneck .",
    "the effect of the defects on the flux is overwhelmingly dominated by the longest bottleneck . for the purpose of our calculation",
    "we replace the probability @xmath54 of the presence of a static defect at a lattice site by that of a mobile particle on the neighboring track .",
    "more specifically , for the calculation of @xmath25 we treat @xmath27 as the counterpart of @xmath54 .",
    "similarly , for the calculation of @xmath29 we replace @xmath54 by @xmath43 . based on these heuristic arguments the fluxes @xmath25 and @xmath29",
    "are given by expressions that are identical to those in ( [ eq - joutjin ] ) except that the effective hopping rates @xmath55 and @xmath56 are replaced by the expressions @xmath57 where , utilizing the sba @xcite , we have @xmath58 note that @xmath48 is a free parameter that is varied to get the best fit with the simulation data .",
    "the best fit to the simulation data are shown in fig.[fig - req1fd ] .",
    "it is worth pointing out that in spite of the increase of @xmath59 and @xmath60 with @xmath11 and @xmath10 , respectively , the exponentials in equations ( [ eq - exponen ] ) do not vanish in the thermodynamic limit because , as we verified , @xmath48 decreases with increasing lengths of the tracks .",
    "the magnitude of the flux @xmath25 depends on the relative direction of motion of the particles in the two tracks . for a fixed set of parameter values ,",
    "we have carried out computer simulations of the model in two different situations : ( a ) when particles move in the same direction in the two tracks ( corresponding data are labelled by the letter ` s ' in fig.[fig - comp ] ) , and ( b ) when the particles move in opposite directions in the two tracks ( corresponding data are labelled by the letter ` o ' in fig.[fig - comp ] ) .",
    "@xmath25 is higher in case of co - directional motion than that for counter - directional motion on the two tracks .",
    "this difference is caused by the phase segregation of the particles into high - density and low - density regions . in case of opposite movements on the two tracks ,",
    "a particle on the outer track has to overcome the full length of a high - density region on the inner track whereas the same particle need not face the full stretch of the same region if it moves co - directionally with the inner - track particles .",
    "since @xmath61 and , since in this section we are assuming @xmath62 ( the smallest allowed value of @xmath63 that preserves its shape is @xmath64 ) , the inner track effectively acts as a `` point '' defect for the particles moving on the outer track .    , @xmath49 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",

    "the values of the other parameters used for this figure are @xmath70.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    first let us consider the special case @xmath71 . in this case the inner track acts effectively as a static `` point - like '' defect . it is well known that macroscopic phase segregation takes place in a tasep with a single point defect , where the density profile exhibits coexistence of a high - density and low - density regimes .",
    "since each of the four sides of the outer track in our model sees a point - like defect , the profile consists of four segments each of which is similar to that of a tasep with a single point - defect ( see fig.[fig - rhoi1phco ] ) .",
    "the flat symmetric plateaus observed on the plots of @xmath25 against @xmath43 correspond to the coexistence of the high - density and low - density regimes .",
    "this qualitatively similar to the corresponding flux - density diagrams for taseps with point defects .",
    "moreover , as shown also in the fig.[fig - rhoi1phco ] , lower is the value of @xmath5 , the stronger is the effect of the bottleneck and the smaller is the flux @xmath25 .",
    "next , in order to demonstrate the more general situations , in fig.[fig - rhoi5phco ] we have plotted @xmath25 as a function of @xmath43 for five values of the parameter @xmath72 .",
    "as the data in this figure show , the higher is the density @xmath27 , loger is longest bottleneck and , consequently , the wider is the plateau region .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that a single bottleneck of longer size lowers the flux to a small value @xcite .",
    "finally , as expected intuitively , the flux - density curve for the outer track approaches the parabolic form @xmath73 in the limit @xmath74 .     of particles with @xmath75",
    "is plotted against @xmath76 for three different values of @xmath77 ; the hopping rates are @xmath50 and @xmath51.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      keeping in mind the possible future application of extensions of our model to the biophysical phenomena mentioned in the introduction , we have also studied the model for particle size @xmath2 larger than @xmath79 . as a typical example , the flux @xmath25 is plotted against the corresponding coverage density @xmath76 in fig.[fig - rgt1fd ] in those situations where all the particles on both the tracks have the same length @xmath75 .",
    "the plateau observed in the special case @xmath19 survives also for all @xmath12 .",
    "however , as is well known for tasep with hard rods @xcite , the maximum of the flux shifts to increasingly higher densities with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "in this paper we have developed a generic model for the tasep on two co - axial square tracks that influence each other without any transfer of particles from one to another . in spite of its extreme simplicity ,",
    "the model exhibits rich variety of phenomena in different parameter regimes . in the limit @xmath80",
