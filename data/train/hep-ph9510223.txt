    "there has been a long - standing interest in the study of the multiplicity distributions of coherent states modified by various dynamical constraints @xcite .",
    "the recent interest in the disoriented chiral condensate ( dcc ) @xcite as a possible explanation of the centauro - type events @xcite has further extended the use of coherent states in the study of unusual charge distributions @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested @xcite that a natural quantum description of the dcc can be given in terms of the squeezed states @xcite . in this paper",
    "we investigate the neutral and charge distributions of squeezed coherent states constrained to form global isospin scalar and vector states that can possibly arise in nuclear collisions at very high energies",
    ". our emphasis will be on the multiplicity distributions of the charged and neutral pions .",
    "it is therefore a significantly more detailed investigation than would be required , if the goal is only to determine the average fraction of neutral particles produced .",
    "if charged pions are always produced in pairs to maintain local charge neutrality of the source medium , it is very natural to consider squeezed states , which are created from the vacuum by operators that are exponentiations of the quadratic forms of the creation and annihilation operators .",
    "although the squeezed states are constructed in quantum optics to reduce noise in certain applications @xcite , their mathematical structure has features that are useful in quantizing classical fields .",
    "their relevance to hadron production in high - energy collisions was recognized long ago @xcite .",
    "recent interest in the subject has been stimulated by the study of chiral phase transition , where the long wavelength pion mode is found in the linear @xmath0 model to grow rapidly after quenching @xcite .",
    "it need not be a dcc , but the interest in developing a quantum description of dcc has led to the realization of the relevance of the squeezed states @xcite .    in our view that is rooted in the phenomenology of hadronic and nuclear collisions , the likelihood of the existence of a long wavelength pion mode or the creation of a dcc shielded from the normal vacuum by a hot shell in a heavy - ion collision is very remote , no matter how ideal or contrived the collision process may be . while we can think of various arguments against the conditions favorable for their occurrence",
    ", there has not been any serious effort made to present a phenomenologically reasonable scenario in the form of realistic modeling that can demonstrate the feasibility of their appearance in actual collisions .",
    "thus the subject is driven so far mainly by the attractiveness of the theoretical idea and the alluring possibility of solving concrete classical equations . until such time as",
    "when experiments suggest the relevance of disoriented chiral condensates to the anomalous production of charge and neutral particles , we shall regard the subject as an interesting speculation that does not preempt other possible approaches .",
    "we begin with the observation of two facts .",
    "one is the empirical fact that anomalous events like the centauro have been recorded in cosmic - ray experiments@xcite , though not in the laboratory .",
    "the other is the lack of a theoretical framework to describe the unusual charge distributions independent of the chiral dynamics .",
    "it seems to us useful to have a language to convey quantitatively the characteristics of the distributions without a rigid dynamical basis so that one may have what amounts to a representation in much the same way that the negative binomial distributions have been used to describe multiplicity distributions in general @xcite . while there exist earlier attempts to describe exotic neutral and charge distributions in terms of the coherent states @xcite , it is better for our purpose to introduce some parameters that can be adjusted to change the neutral - to - charge ratio . to that end we find that the squeezed coherent states are well endowed with features suitable for our needs .",
    "moreover , the consideration of global isotopic spin turns out to be crucial , as in @xcite , since unlike quantum optics the squeezed coherent states produced in hadronic and nuclear collisions must have a limited range of possible initial isotopic spin states .",
    "we should emphasize , however , that the dynamical origin of the squeezed coherent states in such collisions is not an issue that must be addressed first ; we use the squeezed coherent state here only as a mathematical framework to discuss the production of neutral and charge quanta that are locally neutral in a certain limit ( squeezed vacuum ) .",
    "we give in sec .",
    "ii a brief review of the squeezed coherent state . application to particle production is considered in sec .",
    "iii , and the results on multiplicity distributions are presented in sec .",
    "in this section we summarize the basic properties of squeezed states @xcite that are to be used in the following section .",
    "we start with the coherent state @xmath1 , created from the vacuum by the displacement operator @xmath2 : @xmath3 where @xmath4 @xmath5 and @xmath6 are creation and annihilation operators , and @xmath7 is a complex number . from (",
    "[ 2.2 ] ) we have @xmath8 whereupon we obtain the fundamental property that @xmath9 , defined in ( [ 2.1 ] ) , is an eigenstate of @xmath6 @xmath10 with eigenvalue @xmath7",
    ".    the squeeze operator @xmath11 is defined by @xmath12 \\label{2.5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 . a unitary transformation on @xmath6 by @xmath11 yields @xmath14 where @xmath15 inverting ( [ 2.6 ] ) and a similar one on @xmath5 gives @xmath16 the unitary transformation of @xmath11 on the displacement operator yields @xmath17 where @xmath18    the squeeze state @xmath19 is defined by @xmath20 evidently , when @xmath21 , i.e. no squeezing , @xmath22 is identical to the coherent state @xmath9 . even for @xmath23 ,",
    "the expectation value of @xmath6 is still @xmath7 , since we have , using ( [ 2.3 ] ) and ( [ 2.6 ] ) @xmath24 however , @xmath25 is not an eigenstate of @xmath6 for @xmath26 ; instead , it is an eigenstate of @xmath27 , defined in ( [ 2.8 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath28 inverting ( [ 2.8 ] ) we have @xmath29 so that @xmath30 where @xmath31 = 1 $ ] has been used .",
    "it then follows from ( [ 2.13 ] ) and ( [ 2.10 ] ) that @xmath32 thus the expectation value of the number operator for the squeezed state differs from that for the pure coherent state by the additive term @xmath33 .",
    "we now generalize the squeezed states described in the previous section to the isospin space in a manner similar to how the coherent states are generalized in ref .",
    "the annihilation operator @xmath34 is now a vector in the isospin space , and the corresponding eigenstate @xmath35 is created from the vacuum by the operator @xmath36 .",
    "the squeezed state is then @xmath37 the complex vector @xmath38 has a direction in the isospin space , specified by the polar angles @xmath39 and @xmath40 . a squeezed state with a specific total isospin @xmath41 and @xmath42-component @xmath43",
    "can then be expressed in terms of @xmath44 in the usual way @xmath45 what we need to do is to determine the projection of this state to the eigenstates of the number operators specifying the neutral @xmath46 and charged @xmath47 particle multiplicities .",
    "then the multiplicity distribution of a squeezed isospin state is @xmath48 it will be parameterized by the variables @xmath7 and @xmath49 .",
    "more precisely , the results will depend only on the magnitudes @xmath50 and @xmath51 , as one might surmise from ( [ 2.16 ] ) .    to proceed ,",
    "it is necessary to determine first @xmath52 , which in turn can follow from a knowledge of the scalar product between a squeezed state and a coherent state . following yuen @xcite",
    ", we first note that the differential operator representation of any polynomial @xmath53 of @xmath34 and @xmath54 in the coherent - state representation is @xmath55 applying this to @xmath56 for @xmath57 , we have with the help of ( [ 2.13 ] ) @xmath58\\left<\\vec{\\beta }    \\label{3.5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is a differential equation on @xmath59 that has the solution @xmath60\\quad .",
    "\\label{3.6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last term that depends only on @xmath61 and @xmath62 can be determined by working with @xmath63 \\left < \\vec{\\alpha } , \\eta|\\vec{\\beta}\\right > \\nonumber\\\\   & = & \\left ( \\mu \\vec{\\beta }   + { \\nu \\over 2}\\vec{\\beta}^{\\ast } + \\nu { \\partial \\over \\partial \\vec{\\beta } } \\right ) \\left < \\vec{\\alpha } , \\eta|\\vec{\\beta}\\right > \\quad .",
    "\\label{3.7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the required form for @xmath64 is therefore @xmath65    since @xmath66 represents both the neutral and charged sectors , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , in the isospin space , respectively , we have the usual representation of a coherent state @xmath69 in the @xmath70 basis , i.e. , @xmath71 where @xmath72 $ ] is a phase factor that depends on the difference between @xmath73 and @xmath74 charged - particle multiplicities .    using ( [ 3.6 ] ) , ( [ 3.8 ] ) and ( [ 3.9 ] ) on @xmath75 and the expansion @xmath76 where @xmath77 and similarly for @xmath78 and @xmath79 , @xmath80 being the hermite polynomial , we have @xmath81 h_{n_0}\\left [ { \\alpha_0(\\eta ) \\over \\sqrt{2 \\mu \\nu}}\\right ] \\ h_{n_c}\\left [ { \\alpha_c(\\eta ) \\over \\sqrt{2 \\mu \\nu}}\\right ] \\phi(\\phi ) \\quad , \\label{3.12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 = ( n_0 ! n_c!)^{-{1 \\over 2 } } \\left ( { \\nu \\over 2 \\mu}\\right)^{(n_0 + n_c)/2 } \\mbox{exp } \\left [ - { 1 \\over 2 } \\left|\\vec{\\alpha}(\\eta)\\right|^2 +   { \\nu^{\\ast } \\over 2 \\mu } \\vec{\\alpha}^2(\\eta)\\right ] \\quad . \\label{3.13}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that @xmath83 $ ] is independent of the isospin direction , whereas the arguments of @xmath84 are , since @xmath85 and @xmath86 . for the isospin projected state ( [ 3.2 ] ) , we obtain correspondingly @xmath87 where @xmath88    @xmath89    when used in ( [ 3.3 ] ) , this gives us the multiplicity distributions that we seek .",
    "we have not given any special attention to the normalization of @xmath90 as a solution to the differential equation in ( [ 3.5 ] ) . that freedom will be used in normalizing @xmath91 at the end .",
    "there is more freedom in the squeezed states than is needed in our problem . from ( [ 2.7 ] ) and ( [ 2.10 ] ) we recall that @xmath92 let us set @xmath93 and @xmath94 all real so that @xmath95 and @xmath96 from ( [ 3.3 ] ) and ( [ 3.14 ] ) we have @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a normalization factor .",
    "the average multiplicity @xmath99 is @xmath100 as required by ( [ 2.16 ] ) , which is invariant under rotation in the isospin space",
    ". we shall find it more convenient in the following to use the squeeze parameter @xmath101 , defined by @xmath102 so that @xmath103 in all instances that we shall consider below , the value of @xmath101 will be small , so @xmath99 will not be effected very much by squeezing .",
    "nevertheless , we shall see that for certain isospin states the @xmath104 and @xmath105 distributions can be significantly influenced by the small amount of squeezing .",
    "in the next section we shall calculate @xmath106 only for @xmath107 and @xmath108 , although there exist no obstacles in carrying out the computation at higher values of @xmath41 . for @xmath109 annihilation @xmath110",
    "is all that is necessary . for @xmath111",
    "inelastic collisions the isospin of the pion state can in principle be as large as @xmath112 , but we shall restrict our consideration here to only @xmath110 .",
    "it is tacitly assumed that the analysis considered here is only appropriate for the particles produced in the central region .",
    "even for nuclear collisions we hope that @xmath110 is sufficient .    for @xmath113 , we can write @xmath114 thus the @xmath40 integration in ( [ 3.15 ] ) requires @xmath115 . for the @xmath39 integration let us define @xmath116 so that @xmath117 is proportional to it .",
    "let @xmath118 be the generating function , from which @xmath119 can be obtained : @xmath120 eq .",
    "( [ 3.25 ] ) implies @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the euler beta function .",
    "the factor @xmath123 is @xmath108 if @xmath124 = even , @xmath125 if @xmath124 = odd ; it is due to the symmetry of the integrand under @xmath126 .",
    "it can be shown after some algebraic manipulations that @xmath127 since the order of @xmath128 of @xmath129 must be even when @xmath130 , @xmath131 must be even , so @xmath132 . using this in ( [ 3.26 ] ) and ( [ 3.27 ] )",
    "yields @xmath133 we finally have from ( [ 3.20 ] ) @xmath134 ^{-\\left(n_0 + n_c\\right)/2}\\left| j^{k , l}_{n_0 , n_c}(b)\\right|^2 \\label{3.30}\\quad , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath135 is another normalization constant .",
    "from the exponents in ( [ 3.24 ] ) and ( [ 3.25 ] ) , we have    @xmath136    clearly , @xmath137 is even ( odd ) , when @xmath138 .",
    "when @xmath139 , @xmath140 must be even , so @xmath104 must also be even ; for @xmath141 , @xmath104 is odd . thus the evenness or oddness of @xmath104 and @xmath105",
    "can be summarized as follows : @xmath142",
    "in this section we present the results of our calculation of @xmath143 .",
    "our objective is to provide some insight into the dependences on squeezing and on the isospin states . to that end",
    "we shall fix the average multiplicity @xmath144 at some reasonable value , which we take to be 25 .",
    "thus @xmath7 and @xmath101 are constrained through ( [ 3.23 ] ) . to demonstrate the sensitivity on squeezing for certain isospin states",
    ", we shall consider only two small values of @xmath101 , _ viz .",
    "_ , @xmath145 and @xmath146 , which is sufficient to reveal the qualitative features of the @xmath101 dependence",
    ". other higher values of @xmath101 can readily be considered , but are not examined here to avoid visual confusion in the results to be presented .    in calculating @xmath147",
    "we note that @xmath101 , as defined in ( [ 3.22 ] ) , is independent of the sign of @xmath94 .",
    "in ( [ 3.19 ] ) we have taken @xmath148 and @xmath94 to be real , but it does not preclude @xmath94 to be negative , corresponding to @xmath149 in ( [ 2.7 ] ) . since the result will depend on the sign of @xmath94 , we shall use the notation @xmath150 , to stand for sgn@xmath151 , while specifying the value of @xmath101 . in the following the distributions of the neutral and charged sectors",
    "are given separately , where for fixed @xmath144 @xmath152 @xmath153    for @xmath107 , the @xmath154 distribution @xmath155 is insensitive to @xmath150 , but the @xmath156 is highly sensitive to @xmath150 .",
    "this is shown in figs . 1 and 2 for the cases @xmath157 and @xmath158 , respectively .",
    "clearly , @xmath159 is peaked at low @xmath104 , while the peak of @xmath160 shifts to low @xmath105 with increasing @xmath161 , although stationary in @xmath162 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath163 for squeezed states is very similar to the coherent case considered in @xcite .",
    "there , the asymptotic behavior is @xmath164 , where @xmath165 , ( obtained by using the stirling formula in analytical estimates ) .",
    "thus that law is not greatly influenced by slight squeezing .",
    "for @xmath166 , @xmath167 , @xmath157 , @xmath168 is very nearly the same as @xmath169 , even though the former is only for odd @xmath104 and the latter for even @xmath105 , as shown in fig .",
    "their shapes depend sensitively on @xmath162 . for @xmath166 , @xmath167 , @xmath158 ,",
    "the distributions are very different ; @xmath170 is not sensitive to @xmath161 , but @xmath171 is . that is shown in fig .",
    "4 . upon comparing these to @xmath172 ,",
    "it is evident that the distributions depend crucially on the isospin , even though @xmath173 in both cases .",
    "finally , for @xmath166 , @xmath174 , @xmath175 behaves very similarly as @xmath155 , with peaking at low @xmath104 and independence on @xmath150 , as is clear in figs . 5 and 6 .",
    "@xmath176 is also similar to @xmath156 , but the former is only for odd @xmath105 , while the latter is for even @xmath105 . thus the @xmath164 behavior is restored again .",
    "it is relevant to ask whether the @xmath177 limit should be independent of squeezing .",
    "there are two cases to consider : @xmath178 and @xmath101 finite .",
    "the @xmath101 dependence can be seen by examining ( 3.29 ) . for infinitesimal @xmath101",
    ", @xmath179 is large , so the term with @xmath180 and @xmath181 is dominant .",
    "then the large @xmath182 behavior is independent of the hermite polynomials . in the @xmath183",
    "limit the @xmath101 dependence of ( 3.29 ) cancels that in ( 3.20 ) , resulting in no net dependence on @xmath101 .",
    "but if @xmath101 is set at a finite value initially , all terms in the sum in ( 3.29 ) can be important , since @xmath184 diverges with increasing @xmath128 .",
    "the large @xmath182 limit of @xmath185 can then be very different and @xmath106 can depend in @xmath101 , even if @xmath101 is not large . in both cases , if @xmath182 is not infinite , there would in general be some dependence on @xmath101 , the details of which can only be seen from the numerical results .",
    "it is for this reason that our results depend on squeezing .    to summarize",
    ", we observe that in all isospin states the @xmath105 distributions are most sensitive to squeezing , not just in the value of @xmath101 , but especially in the sign of @xmath94 .",
    "that is to be contrasted from the peaking of the neutral distribution @xmath186 at @xmath187 for both the @xmath188 state and the @xmath189 state , revealing the preference for small numbers of neutral pions for either sign of @xmath94 . on the other hand , for @xmath190 the neutral to charge",
    "ratio is about 1 when @xmath191 , but is greater than 1 when @xmath192 .",
    "the latter therefore leans toward the characteristics of the anti - centauro events . by varying @xmath41 , @xmath43 , and @xmath150",
    ", one can obtain a wide variety of possible shapes of @xmath193 that could be used to fit the observed charged particle distribution in high - energy collision for any given average total multiplicity . in that sense",
    "its usefulness is rather similar to that of the negative binomial distribution , which has a @xmath194 parameter that adjusts the width .",
    "it should be noted that neither the negative binomial nor the pure squeezed - state distributions can reproduce properly the behavior of the cumulants observed in the experiments @xcite , whereas the question about squeezed isospin states is so far open . unlike the negative binomial distribution",
    ", we now have a great deal more freedom to accommodate very anomalous production processes , where the neutral to charge ratio need not be 1:2 .",
    "indeed , @xmath186 can be peaked at @xmath195 , which is a feature that may render this description relevant to the centauro events . by varying the squeeze parameter",
    ", one can not only adjust the neutral to charge ratio , but also change the detailed @xmath104 and @xmath105 dependences .",
    "we have not made any proposal in this paper to suggest that the dynamical origin for the anomalous production of particles is related to the squeezed states .",
    "we have only presented a formalism for the phenomenological description of unusual @xmath186 and @xmath193 .",
    "if in the future such a formalism is found empirically to be well suited for the data , then perhaps one may be motivated to look deeper into the question of whether squeezed states are produced in certain collisions at high energy .",
