    "the firmly established disappearance of muon neutrinos of cosmic ray origin  @xcite strongly points toward the existence of neutrino oscillations  @xcite .",
    "the first generation long baseline ( lbl ) experiments  k2k  @xcite , minos  @xcite , opera  @xcite and icanoe  @xcite  will give a conclusive and unambiguous signature of the oscillation mechanism and will provide the first precise measurements of the parameters governing the oscillation mechanism .",
    "miniboone  @xcite and the lbl programs will test the lsnd signal@xcite .    a neutrino `` factory ''  @xcite is based on the decay of muons circulating in a storage ring .",
    "neutrino factories raised the interest of the physics community , since they appear natural follow - ups to the current experimental lbl program and could open the way to future muon colliders .",
    "as many studies have shown  @xcite , the physics potential of such facilities are indeed very vast .",
    "an entry - level neutrino factory could test the lsnd signal in a background free environment@xcite .",
    "more importantly , a neutrino factory source would be of sufficiently high intensity to perform very long baseline ( transcontinental ) experiments .",
    "it could also bring the neutrino sector into the realm of precision measurements .",
    "the neutrino oscillation phenomenology may be complicated and involve a combination of transitions to @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "it is quite evident that future neutrino factories will provide ideal conditions for the neutrino oscillation physics@xcite .",
    "the neutrino flavor phenomenology could be completely explored : a precise measurement of the mass difference and mixing matrix elements is achievable , a test of the unitarity of the mixing matrix can be performed , a direct detection of earth matter effects is feasible  @xcite and cp violation effects could be studied on the leptonic sector  @xcite .",
    "the combination of data from atmospheric neutrino and first generation lbl experiments will provide some preliminary information on the possible sub - leading electron mixing@xcite .",
    "a neutrino factory can largely improve the sensitivity on this mixing angle .",
    "neutrino sources from muon decays provide clear advantages over neutrino beams from pion decays .",
    "the exact neutrino helicity composition is a fundamental tool to study neutrino oscillations .",
    "it can be easily selected , since @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be separately obtained .    at a neutrino factory",
    ", one could independently study the following flavor transitions : @xmath5 plus 6 other charge conjugate processes initiated from @xmath6 decays .",
    "the other main advantages over traditional pion beams are ( 1 ) the beam is free of systematics and the composition is well known , therefore ideal for disappearance studies ; ( 2 ) the two neutrinos in the beam have opposite helicities , therefore one can envisage oscillation appearance searches without intrinsic beam backgrounds ( 3 ) the muon energy is monochromatic and in principle adaptable ( 4 ) muon storage rings allow for multiple baselines , and hence a complete exploration of the @xmath7 domains of oscillations ( 5 ) because very high intensity will be needed for muon colliders , very intense muon sources will produce very intense neutrino sources , at least a factor 100 more intense than existing high energy facilities .    while physics motivations are well understood , it is not yet clear which design of detector would best allow to take full advantage of the neutrino factory beams .",
    "we think that , in order to fully explore the neutrino oscillation processes , the detector should be capable of :    1 .   measuring and identifying all three lepton flavors : electron , muon and tau ; 2 .   measuring the sign of the lepton charge ; 3 .",
    "separating between charged and neutral current interactions .",
    "experimentally , it is a very challenging task to build detectors with ( 1 ) mass scales of the order of tens of ktons required for long - baseline experiments , ( 2 ) with sufficient granularity to cleanly identify electron and tau leptons and ( 3 ) which measure the charge of these leptons .",
    "various solutions have been explored recently .",
    "one based on nuclear emulsions and magnetized iron has been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the main challenge there is to reach the required mass .",
    "large magnetized calorimeters have been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "such high - density detectors , while `` easily '' conceived as massive objects , have intrinsically very coarse granularity and only allow the clean measurement of muons .",
    "they certainly do not have sufficient power to adequately identify and measure electron or tau charged current states .    in this paper",
    ", we are motivated by the recent progress made in the direction of the design of the multikton icanoe detector@xcite : accordingly , we consider a 10  kton ( fiducial ) high granularity low density liquid argon imaging target , complemented with a high - acceptance external muon spectrometer .",
    "thanks to its extremely high granularity target and its excellent calorimetric properties , this design provides the clean identification and measurement of all three neutrino flavors : electron , muons and taus .",
    "however , only the sign of the muons reaching the muon spectrometer can be determined .",
    "the aim of this paper is to understand the potentials of a non - magnetized high - granularity target detector which , compared to traditional high density iron calorimeters , brings the measurement of electrons and taus .",
    "we study the physics potentials of such a detector configuration for three - family neutrino mixing and for three different baselines ( 732 , 2900 and 7400 km ) .    in section  [ sec :",
    "neuosc ] we summarize three - family neutrino mixing framework , including the treatment of propagation through matter .    in section  [ sec : evratedist ]",
    ", we explain in details how the event distributions and rates are obtained from a detailed simulation of neutrino interactions and detector effects .    in section  [ sec : evtclass ]",
    ", we construct for given oscillation scenarios , event variable distributions for various event classes .",
    "all events can be subdivided into the electron , the same sign muons , the wrong sign muons and the no lepton samples .",
    "in addition , in section  [ sec : kineanal ] we discuss the possibility to further discriminate final states between @xmath0 and @xmath1 origins from @xmath2 by means of kinematical analysis of the events .",
    "we also address in section  [ sec : quasi ] the possibility to tag quasi - elastic events which provide indirect neutrino helicity discrimination however at a large statistical price .",
    "section  [ sec : fit ] is devoted to describing our fits of the oscillation parameters .",
    "the fits are expected to give back the input reference oscillation parameters and are used to estimate the precision with which we can estimate these parameters .",
    "section  [ sec : mixing ] presents the results for the important case in which the oscillation effects can be approximated by one mass scale .",
    "since the information about the oscillation parameter is redundantly available in the visible energy distributions of the various event classes , we address in section  [ sec : taus ] the question of the consistency between the different observed oscillations processes .",
    "the ability to treat the appearance of electron or tau neutrinos gives good over - constraints on the mixing matrix .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : cp ] , we analyze the three - family scenario including possible @xmath8-violation .",
    "we consider neutrino oscillations in a three - family scenario : the flavor eigenstates @xmath9 are related to the mass eigenstates @xmath10 by the mixing matrix u @xmath11 and we parameterize it as : @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we confine without loss of generality the mixing angle @xmath15 to values in the interval @xmath16 $ ] , and @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 to the interval @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "we present results in terms of @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , all running in the interval @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "the reason for this choice can be for example seen in appendix  a , where we recall oscillation probabilities in the one mass scale approximation .",
    "the oscillation probabilities for @xmath25 and @xmath26 depend on @xmath21 and on the sin and cosine of @xmath27 .",
    "the angle @xmath27 must span the interval @xmath20 $ ] , however , the @xmath15 can vary within interval @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "note that we consider small @xmath15 angles , so the @xmath28 dependence in @xmath29 is very mild .    for @xmath30 (",
    "i.e. @xmath31 is real ) , the general expression for the three - family neutrino oscillation probability is : @xmath32 where in natural units @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the neutrino energy , @xmath35 is the neutrino path - length , and the jarlskog term is @xmath36 .",
    "we naturally assign the mass difference squared @xmath37 to explain the solar neutrino deficit and the mass difference squared @xmath38 to describe the atmospheric neutrino anomaly .",
    "we will take as reference value @xmath39 . to cover possible ranges of this value ,",
    "we will also consider two other values @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we will always assume maximal ( 2 - 3)-mixing @xmath42 . in case of the solar neutrino deficit solution ,",
    "the values for @xmath37 and mixing @xmath43 are not uniquely defined by experiments .",
    "we will limit ourself to the lma - msw solution with parameters @xmath44 and hypothesize a maximal ( 1 - 2)-mixing @xmath45 .    in this paper",
    ", we do not consider the lsnd result which would force us to include more states with new parameters beyond three - family mixing .",
    "this choice implies that we will always work in a situation where @xmath46 . in first approximation ,",
    "the oscillation phenomena governed by the two mass differences decouple and the effects produced by @xmath37 are small at high energy for the considered baselines . in the first part of this paper , we will neglect @xmath37 effects and work in the so - called `` one mass scale approximation''@xcite . in a second phase , we will be concerned with @xmath8-violation effects and will have to include @xmath37 .    for simplicity , we will take @xmath47 which implies @xmath48 .",
    "we recall that neutrino oscillations through matter can be used to distinguish @xmath48 from @xmath49 .    in vacuum",
    ", we will express the oscillation probability as a function of the seven following parameters : ( a ) the three mixing angles @xmath17,@xmath50,@xmath27 ; ( b ) the two mass differences squared @xmath37 , @xmath51 ; ( c ) the baseline l ; ( d ) the neutrino energy @xmath34 .",
    "since we will consider very long distances between neutrino production and detection , this will only be possible in practice for neutrinos traveling inside the earth . in this case",
    ", the neutrino oscillation probabilities will be modified by an additional diagram due to the interaction of electron neutrino with the electrons in the matter@xcite .",
    "one can maintain the neutrino oscillation formalism derived in vacuum but define effective masses and mixing angles valid in matter .",
    "for example , the effective masses will result from the diagonalization of the hamiltonian : @xmath52 where @xmath53 here , @xmath54 is the electron density and @xmath55 the matter density . for anti - neutrinos , we must replace @xmath56 by @xmath57 . for @xmath58 ,",
    "the effective mass parameter @xmath56 is of the order of the mass splitting that is derived from the atmospheric neutrino anomaly .",
    "we then expect matter effects to be important .    within the two - family mixing scheme",
    ", the modification of the flavor transition in matter is taken into account by the mixing angle in matter @xmath59 , which is : @xmath60 for neutrinos , a resonance condition will be met when @xmath61 and the oscillation amplitude will reach a maximum .",
    "the resonant neutrino energy @xmath62 is @xmath63    rather than two - family mixing , we have adopted throughout this study three - family framework . in this context , we use the analytic expressions for the matter mixing angles and mass eigenvalues calculated in  @xcite ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the mass eigenvalues in matter @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are : @xmath67 where @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are given in the appendix . for the mixing angles in matter",
    "the analytical expressions read : @xmath71 where @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are found in the appendix .",
    "to illustrate matter effects in three - neutrino mixing framework , we show in figure  [ fig : anglemat ] the values of the mixing angles in matter , plotted as a function of @xmath76 , or equivalently of @xmath77 .",
    "the parameter values in vacuum correspond to our reference values for atmospheric and lma - msw solar experiments .",
    "the resonant behavior of @xmath78 is clearly visible .",
    "it gives maximum oscillation at a neutrino energy of about 12  gev for a density of 3.7  @xmath79 .",
    "there is a similar resonant behavior for @xmath80 but it occurs at low energy since it is driven by @xmath81 . for @xmath82 , the angles @xmath83 and @xmath84 tend to rise slightly , because the non - vanishing @xmath81 splitting removes the degeneracy between muon and tau flavors .",
    "our results have been computed assuming a constant density along the whole neutrino path , and equal to the mean density , obtained integrating over the earth profile @xcite .",
    "this approximation yields , as shown in e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , similar results to those obtained by numerical integration using the actual earth s density profile .",
    "the oscillation probability through matter will be a function of eight parameters : ( a ) the vacuum three mixing angles @xmath17,@xmath50,@xmath27 ; ( b ) the vacuum two mass differences squared @xmath37 , @xmath85 ; ( c ) the average earth density @xmath55 ; ( d ) the baseline l ; ( e ) the neutrino energy @xmath34 .",
    "the exact parameters of a neutrino factory are not yet completely fixed and realistic scenarios are in the process to be defined@xcite .",
    "however , based on @xcite , we can assume that the muons in the storage ring have an energy @xmath86 gev and that after one year of operation , the factory should deliver about @xmath87 `` useful '' muons decays of both polarities in the straight section pointing towards the far detector location .",

    "we observe that somewhat better determination exists at @xmath103 km since this oscillation mode is largely influenced by matter effects given its dependence on @xmath50 .",
    "we conclude that a precision at the level of a few per cent on the observation of @xmath247 oscillations would require @xmath249 useful muon decays .",
    "let us consider now a more complex scenario . in this case ,",
    "the value of the mass difference @xmath37 is not any more negligible , and is actually assumed to be @xmath250 , one of the highest values compatible with the large mixing angle msw solution for solar neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the oscillation does not depend any more on only three parameters , but all four independent angles of the mixing matrix and the two mass differences become important .    in the most general case , the phase @xmath19 can be different from zero , producing a complex mixing matrix , and thus generating cp violation .",
    "we recall that for neutrinos propagating in vacuum , the oscillation probability after a distance @xmath35 for neutrinos can be expressed as : @xmath251 and for antineutrinos : @xmath252    as an illustration , the probability for @xmath105 to @xmath107 conversion in vacuum , assuming three family mixing and cp - violation , is given by : @xmath253 where the @xmath8-phase in matter is : @xmath254 here , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are given in the appendix .    in case of degenerate mass differences , @xmath255 , the @xmath19 phase is significantly modified from its original value in vacuum for @xmath256 radians , while in the case @xmath257 the cp phase is almost unaffected by the presence of matter .",
    "in addition , neutrino propagation in a dense medium makes more difficult to experimentally extract a genuine cp violation signal , since the asymmetrical behavior of matter , with respect to neutrinos and anti - neutrinos , induces fake cp violation effects .",
    "to evaluate the sensitivity to this kind of measurement as a function of the oscillation parameters and of the selected baseline , we compare the case where cp violation is maximal ( @xmath258 ) and the case of no cp violation ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : cpsignificance ] shows the sensitivity @xmath259 i.e. the difference between the two extreme cases , divided by the statistical error ( being n the number of events in each energy bin , for a given value of @xmath19 ) .",
    "we can see that for the baseline of 732 km , this quantity is positive for almost the full energy range , so there is no real shape variation in the spectrum , and the cp effect is similar to what would be obtained with a change in the angle @xmath50 . on the other hand , for larger baselines",
    "this curve crosses the zero , and the cp violation produces a visible deformation of the energy spectrum .",
    "to evaluate the precision reachable on the measurement of these three oscillations parameters , we perform fits assuming the following reference values : @xmath260    figure  [ fig : cpvar ] shows for the baseline l=2900 km , the expected visible energy spectra for electron and wrong sing muon class for the two cases @xmath30 and @xmath258 , and their difference in terms of number of events .",
    "as expected , in absolute values , the cp violation affects the two classes in a similar way , but the effect is much more visible and significant for the wrong - sign muons , since the total number of events is smaller .",
    "figure  [ fig : cpvar ] is normalized to @xmath261 decays , since this is the minimum amount of decays required to produce a statistically significant observation of cp violation .",
    "for the largest baseline @xmath103 km , cp violation effects are almost undetectable even in case @xmath262 since , wrong sing muon appearance is largely dominated by matter effects . at @xmath98 km , the effect of a non - vanishing @xmath19 is more striking thanks to the higher event rates and the smaller neutrino path in matter . however , as we formerly pointed out , this effect is similar to the one produced by a smaller value of @xmath50 and therefore , both effects can not be disentangled with a single measurement at this baseline as shown in figure  [ fig : cpvst13 ] , where the correlations between @xmath19 and @xmath50 prevent a precise determination of any of them .",
    "nonetheless , a measurement at @xmath103 km where cp violation effects are negligible and the most accurate determination of @xmath50 exits , can be combined with data collected at @xmath98 km to produce a precise determination of @xmath19 .    another possibility to unveil",
    "the existence of cp violation is to perform a single measurement at @xmath101 km .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : cpvar ] , at this distance the effect of @xmath263 is twofold : not only the event rate is modified but also the spectral shape .",
    "this last effect can not be produced by a change on @xmath50 .",
    "figure  [ fig : cpvst13 ] shows that at this distance the correlation between @xmath19 and @xmath50 has diminished and therefore a better determination of the parameters can be achieved with a single measurement",
    ".    for a baseline of @xmath101 km , matter effects are not so strong as for the longest baseline .",
    "the possibility of measuring the cp - violating phase @xmath19 is not spoiled by the fake asymmetries due to the matter interactions , but both effects , even if correlated , can be measured at the same time .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : dvsrho ] , where the result of a simultaneous fit to the average matter density @xmath55 and the phase @xmath19 is presented for the two cases where @xmath55 is left as a free parameter or it is known beforehand with a @xmath238 accuracy .    in case",
    "no cp violation is observed , the allowed @xmath19 values at 90@xmath204 c.l . as a function of @xmath37",
    "are shown in figure  [ fig : cpsensi ] for two different muon normalizations .",
    "on the other hand , if a significant effect is detected , the precision achievable on the measurement of the cp phase @xmath19 is shown in figure  [ fig : cpmeas ] .",
    "we fit @xmath19 using all event classes , leaving the five parameters governing the oscillation free . assuming a reference value of @xmath264 for @xmath19 and @xmath88 muon decays of each polarity , we get : @xmath265 .",
    "therefore a precision around 20@xmath204 is expected .",
    "finally , we note that the change on the expected precision for @xmath50 is negligible when @xmath37 and @xmath17 are included in the fit .",

    "<S> in order to fully address the oscillation processes at a neutrino factory , a detector should be capable of identifying and measuring all three charged lepton flavors produced in charged current interactions _ and _ of measuring their charges to discriminate the incoming neutrino helicity . </S>",
    "<S> this is an experimentally challenging task , given the required detector mass for long - baseline experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we address the benefit of a high - granularity , excellent - calorimetry non - magnetized target - detector , which provides a background - free identification of electron neutrino charged current and a kinematical selection of tau neutrino charged current interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that charge discrimination is only available for muons reaching an external magnetized - fe spectrometer . </S>",
    "<S> this allows the clean classification of events into electron , right - sign muon , wrong - sign muon and no - lepton categories . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , high granularity permits a clean detection of quasi - elastic events , which by detecting the final state proton , provide a selection of the neutrino electron helicity without the need of an electron charge measurement . from quantitative analyses of neutrino oscillation scenarios , </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that in many cases the discovery sensitivities and the measurements of the oscillation parameters are dominated by the ability to measure the muon charge . </S>",
    "<S> however , we identify cases where identification of electron and tau samples contributes significantly .    </S>",
