    "deep x - ray images of a patch of the sky show numerous x - ray sources , which mainly consist of a mixture of absorbed and unabsorbed active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "it is now recognized that these agns make up the bulk of what has been called the `` x - ray background '' .",
    "while normal galaxies , whose x - ray emission is probably dominated by the integration of x - ray binaries , start to emerge @xcite at the faintest fluxes , the dominant x - ray source population in the deep chandra and xmm - newton surveys comes from agn activities .",
    "thus multiwavelength studies of these x - ray sources are key to understanding the detailed history and physical conditions of the formation and the growth of the supermassive blackholes ( smbhs ) , which are now known to reside in the centers of almost all galaxies with a bulge @xcite .",
    "the region known as the `` groth - westphal strip '' ( gws ) , consists of hubble space telescope ( hst ) wide - field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) medium - deep images of a strip of 28 contiguous fields@xcite .",
    "it is a particularly useful field for extensive multiwavelength studies .",
    "numerous on - going and future followup projects have been/ are being conducted on and around this field . existing morphological information from the original wfpc2 observations , combined with the deep extragalactic evolutionary probe ( deep ) , canada - france redshift survey ( cfrs)lilly / cfrs/ ] and the ongoing deep 2 redshift surveys , is providing us with the first clues to the nature of the x - ray source counterparts .    because of the contamination from starlight in the host galaxy , optical searches for faint agns in deep survey fields such as gws need elaborate efforts .",
    "such attempts have been made by searching for an unresolved component at the centers of galaxies , searching for variable nuclei , and by selecting those with ultraviolet - excess cores @xcite .",
    "these surveys reveal up to 10% of galaxies as agn candidates with nuclei extending as faint as m@xmath7@xmath8 15 .",
    "optical searches , however , are less sensitive to agns obscured by dust around the active nucleus . on the other hand ,",
    "x - ray surveys for agns are not hindered by the luminosity of the underlying host galaxy .",
    "in particular , x - ray surveys with hard band ( @xmath9 kev ) sensitivity are also sensitive to the obscured agns .    in view of this",
    ", we have obtained an 80 ks exposure the northeast part of the gws with xmm - newton .",
    "this field also has the advantage of a low column density of neutral gas in our galaxy , corresponding to @xmath10 @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "a quick look view and the preliminary log n - log s relations from these data have been presented in @xcite and @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we present the nature of the 23 x - ray sources in the gws , where morphological properties from the wfpc2 images and some redshifts are available from the deep / cfrs redshift surveys . we further make supplemental near infrared spectroscopic observation for some of these x - ray sources for which we did not observe agn signatures in the optical spectra .",
    "@xmath2 band photometry of the x - ray sources are also presented .",
    "the scope of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : xobs ] , we describe the x - ray data and analysis , including source detection and spectral analysis . in section [ sec :",
    "opt_ir ] , we explain the source of the optical and near infrared ( nir ) data . the optical and nir nature of the xmm - newton sources and related statistics are presented . in [ sec : disc ] , we discuss the overall results on these x - ray sources and black hole mass and the relationship with the bulge luminosity",
    ". we also comment on selected individual sources .",
    "a summary is given in [ sec : sum ] . throughout this paper , we use @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 . unless otherwise noted , @xmath15 is the 2 - 10 kev rest - frame luminosity in units of @xmath16 calculated using the cosmological parameters shown above .",
    "the field has been observed with xmm - newton as part of a guaranteed time program ( pi : griffiths ) . after cleaning for background flares",
    ", we have obtained a total of 69 ks and 81 ks of exposure for epic pn and mos respectively .",

    "we have determined the positions of the counterpart x - ray sources by gaussian fits for two broad line agns detected in the canada - france redshift survey @xcite and a few objects in the medium deep survey ( mds ) database @xcite with trivial x - ray counterparts . based on the positions of the optical counterparts , we have determined the linear transformation coefficients of the x - ray source positions . during this process",
    ", we did not use x - ray sources which fell in the gaps of the ccds . using the coefficients , we then aligned each cleaned epic event file .    using the aligned events , we made summed images in three energy bands , corresponding to photon energies of 0.5 - 2 , 2 - 4.5 and 4.5 - 10 kev .",
    "we also made a 2 - 10 kev image . in making the images ,",
    "we have used pattern@xmath174 ( 12 ) for the pn ( mos ) data and applied the standard screening criteria . in order to avoid the instrumental line emission feature which dominates the background in 7.33 - 9.05 kev ,",
    "the channel energy range corresponding to this energy range has been excluded from the pn data . also exposure maps have been created for each energy band using the task `` eexpmap '' .",
    "the mos exposure maps in each band have been multiplied by the ratio of the mos and pn efficiencies in the given band , so that the source counts from the summed ( pn+2moss ) image divided by the summed exposure map gives count rates which can be converted to fluxes using the pn response .",
    "the slight shift due to the alignment process ( at most 2@xmath18 ) is negligible in the usage of the exposure map .",
    "the final source detection has been made to the sum of all pn and mos data for the three bands .",
    "these three images were simultaneously fed into the sas software eboxdetect in the `` local '' mode .",
    "for each band , we have created the `` background map '' by cubic spline fitting the source excluded image ( divided by the exposure map ) using the sources detected in the first step . the next step is to use these `` background '' maps to re - run the eboxdetect in the `` map '' mode , i.e. , search for the excess over the background map .",
    "the final step is to make a multi - source maximum - likelihood fit over the background map using the positions of the sources in the previous step as a starting model .",
    "this has been made using the sas task `` emldetect '' .",
    "the images in the soft ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) , medium ( 2 - 4.5 kev ) , and ultra - hard ( 4.5 - 10 kev ) bands have been simultaneously fit .",
    "the procedure also calculates the source detection likelihood for each band as well as for the sum of these .",
    "we accepted sources with a likelihood parameter of @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the probability that the source exists .",
    "we also made a separate source detection to the 2 - 10 kev image to obtain fluxes of the sources in a more traditional energy band .",
    "one of the caveats is that cubic spline fits generated using the sas procedure `` esplinemap '' sometimes generate spurious wavy structures depending on the choice of the number of spline nodes ( the esplinemap parameter _ nsplinenodes _ ) .",
    "this is probably because some structures in the input image are not well represented by the spline function for the given number of nodes .",
    "in order to obtain the best background map , we have manually varied the number of spline nodes until a satisfactory background map is obtained .",
    "while this strategy involves a certain subjectiveness , we have checked the goodness of this strategy with extensive simulations .",
    "the basic results of this analysis are presented in @xcite .",
    "while the source detection should be improved for further quantitative analysis @xcite , our current source detection scheme provides a sufficiently complete list of x - ray sources for the purpose of this paper which is focused on the multiwavelength properties of the x - ray sources within a limited area .",
    "these have been verified by visual comparisons of the images and the detected source lists .",
    "the detected source counts have been converted into `` effective '' count rates by dividing by the value of the exposure map smoothed with a @xmath21 gaussian .    in this paper , we concentrate on the sources which fall within the hst wfpc2 fields of view .",
    "sixteen of the original 28 gws fields overlap with the xmm field of view .",
    "additionally , there is another wfpc2 field in this general field ( pi lilly ) .",
    "we excluded from this paper a few x - ray sources located close to the edge of the wfpc2 field if their optical counterparts were not included in the mds database .",
    "table [ tab : srcs ] lists the x - ray sources within the wfpc2 fovs detected using the above procedure . in this table",
    ", the fluxes have been obtained from the count rate assuming a power - law or an absorbed power - law spectrum , depending on the hardness ratios from detected count rates in the 0.5 - 2 and 2 - 10 kev bands .",
    "if the hardness ratio corresponds to an effective photon index of @xmath22 , a power - law spectrum is used . for a harder spectrum , an absorbed spectrum with fixed @xmath23 and varying intrinsic absorption column density ( @xmath24 ) placed at @xmath25 ( a typical redshift of the sources )",
    "as long as the value of @xmath24 is matched to the observed hardness ratio , the count rate to flux conversion factor is insensitive to the assumed redshift .",

    "the x - ray hardness ratios and spectroscopic analysis show that a major part of the observed x - ray sources consists of a mixture of absorbed and unabsorbed agns .",

    "the @xmath5 and @xmath142 colors of the x - ray sources with bulge - dominated hosts well trace those of evolving elliptical galaxies .",
    "sources with stellar morphologies show bluer colors with some scatter , and consistent with agn(qso ) with a host galaxy contamination and/or dust absorption .",
    "ten x - ray sources with redshift information have a resolved bulge . based on a number of assumptions concerning the bulge luminosity - blackhole mass relation , we estimate that these agn have luminosities ranging from 0.3 - 10% of the eddington luminosity , suggesting that these massive blackholes have previously gone through massive accretion ( maybe as luminous qsos ) or that their lifetimes are relatively long ( @xmath143 yrs ) .",
