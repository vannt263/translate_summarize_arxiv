    "almost half a century ago , peierls demonstrated that a one - dimensional ( 1d ) metallic system can support a periodic modulation in the equilibrium positions of the lattice ions@xcite .",
    "for the case of a half - filled band , the broken - symmetry phase is commensurate with the lattice , resulting in a doubling of the unit cell of the ground state ( gs ) . since the dimerization opens a gap at the fermi surface , the peierls process transforms the metal to a dielectric phase , with the increase in lattice energy associated with the permanent distortion being offset by the reduction in electronic kinetic energy .",
    "spontaneous dimerization has been noted in many quasi-1d materials , ranging from organic conjugated polymers@xcite and charge - transfer salts@xcite to inorganic blue bronzes@xcite and mx - chains@xcite .",
    "the peierls instability is well understood in the _",
    "static lattice _",
    "limit for which the frequency , @xmath5 , of the peierls - active mode is taken to be much smaller than the electron hopping integral , @xmath6 . in the adiabatic phonon limit , the gs is known to have a broken - symmetry staggered dimerization for arbitrary electron - phonon coupling .",
    "experimentally , such behavior was first observed in the 1970s for the organic compounds of the ttf and tcnq series@xcite . for many quasi - one - dimensional materials , however , the zero - point fluctuations of the phonon field are comparable to the amplitude of the peierls distortion@xcite .",
    "lattice dynamic ( quantum phonons ) effects should therefore be included in a full theoretical treatment of peierls - distorted systems .",
    "likewise , interest in models of _ spins _ coupled dynamically to phonons increased significantly when it was shown that the first inorganic spin - peierls ( sp ) compound cugeo@xmath7@xcite exhibits no clear scale - separation between magnetic and phononic energies .",
    "moreover , in contrast to the organic sp materials , no phonon - softening is observed at the transition .",
    "sp physics , then , is plainly in the non - adiabatic regime .    using the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )",
    ", it has been demonstrated that quantum fluctuations destroy the peierls state for small , non - zero couplings in both the spinless@xcite and spin-@xmath8@xcite holstein models at half - filling .",
    "analogous results for the @xmath9-sp model with gapped , dispersionless ( einstein ) phonons were obtained by caron and moukouri @xcite , using finite - size scaling analysis of the spin gap to demonstrate a power - law relating the critical coupling and the peierls - active phonon frequency : @xmath10 .",
    "et al.__@xcite used a renormalization group ( rg ) treatment of the bosonized heisenberg - sp model to demonstrate similar behavior in the antiadiabatic phonon regime ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "in general , for models with sufficiently large einstein frequency , gapped phonon degrees of freedom can always be integrated away to generate a low - energy effective - fermion hamiltonian characterized by instantaneous , non - local interactions@xcite .",
    "gapless , dispersive ( debye ) phonons were found by the present authors to destabilize the broken - symmetry gs of the heisenberg - sp chain@xcite , which maps to a spinless - fermion - peierls chain under jordan - wigner ( jw ) transformation . by interpolating between the einstein- and debye - phonon limits ,",
    "the spin - peierls phase was shown to be _ more _ unstable with respect to dispersive lattice degrees of freedom .",
    "for the su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) model , fradkin and hirsch undertook an extensive study of spin-@xmath8 ( @xmath12 ) and spinless ( @xmath13 ) fermions using world - line monte carlo simulations@xcite . in the antiadiabatic limit ( i.e.  vanishing ionic mass @xmath14 ) , they mapped the system onto an @xmath15-component gross - neveu model , known to exhibit long - ranged dimerization for arbitrary coupling for @xmath16 ( although not for @xmath13 ) . for @xmath17",
    "an rg analysis indicates the low - energy behavior of the @xmath12 model to be governed by the zero - mass limit of the theory , indicating that the spinful model presents a dimerized gs for arbitrarily weak e - ph couplings@xcite .",
    "although of theoretical interest , independent - electron models are not sufficient to give a quantitative account of the properties of physical systems exhibiting a peierls distortion  for that , electron - electron ( e - e ) interactions must to included .",
    "the interplay between e - e and electron - phonon ( e - ph ) interactions results in an extremely rich phase - diagram of broken - symmetry gss , each supporting a range of low - energy electron - lattice excitations : solitons , polarons , lattice  breathers \" , etc@xcite .",
    "for the half - filled hubbard model , repulsive on - site interactions in the charge sector ( @xmath18 ) give rise to the opening of a charge gap @xmath19 and , in the absence of e - ph couplings , the system is a mott insulator ( mi ) : a critical dielectric phase exhibiting algebraically decaying spin - spin correlations@xcite .",
    "hence , the transition from the mott insulator ( mi ) to the peierls insulator ( pi ) phase is accompanied only by the generation of a spin gap @xmath20 , the charge gap having arisen by virtue of mutual electronic repulsions .",
    "longer range e - e interactions , e.g. next - nearest neighbor terms ( @xmath21 ) , can destroy the mott state , however , and are expected to influence the mi - pi transition . even in the absence of lattice degrees of freedom , the phase diagram of the simplest half - filled extended hubbard model is still controversial : its behavior close to the @xmath22 line has attracted significant attention , with a peierls - like bond - ordered gs predicted to exist@xcite .",
    "sengupta _ _ et al.__@xcite , using the extended hubbard model coupled to einstein _ bonds _ phonons , demonstrated the destruction of the pi below a non - zero value of the e - ph coupling , in agreement with earlier independent - electron treatments .",
    "work by zimanyi _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite on one - dimensional models with both e - e and e - ph interactions indicated the development of a spin gap provided the combined backscattering amplitude @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the contribution from e - e interactions and @xmath25 is the e - ph contribution in the notation of @xcite .",
    "hence , for the pure _ spinful _ ssh model ( @xmath26 ) , @xmath27 and @xmath28 for any nonzero e - ph coupling , implying a peierls gs for arbitrary e - ph coupling , in agreement with the earlier mc results@xcite . it should be noted , however , that a dimerized state was also predicted for @xmath29 in the spin-@xmath8 holstein model , for which later large - scale calculations indicated a nonzero critical coupling@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we examine the influence of gapless , dispersive phonons on the gs of the extended hubbard - peierls ( ehp ) chain .",
    "we explicitly probe the mi - pi transition , studying the model as a function of the electron - phonon interaction @xmath30 , coulomb interactions @xmath2 and @xmath21 , and phonon frequency @xmath5 . in all cases",
    "we consider a half - filled band .",
    "since the parameter space of this model is rather large , we restrict our study to a physically reasonable ratio @xmath31 of the e - e parameters for the full phonon - frequency range .",
    "in addition , we investigate the model for @xmath32 for all values of @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath4 limit is of particular relevance to our earlier work since@xcite , in the limit of large hubbard interactions , the ehp hamiltonian maps onto the quantum heisenberg - peierls antiferromagnet .",
    "however , for most polyenes , the coulomb interactions are not large enough to justify the spin model@xcite .",
    "we also note that in the limit of vanishing phonon frequency ( @xmath33 ) the model maps onto the extensively studied classical adiabatic chain .    that the dispersive - phonon ehp model is yet to receive the same level of attention as its gapped , dispersionless counterpart is due in part to the presence of hydrodynamic modes , resulting in logarithmically increasing vibrational amplitudes with chain length .",
    "to this end , acoustic phonons have been assumed to decouple from the low - energy electronic states involved in the peierls instability , motivating the retention of only the optical phonons close to @xmath34@xcite . in this",
    "regard , optical phonons have been expected to be equivalent to fully quantum mechanical ssh phonons . even for pure einstein phonons",
    ", however , wellein , fehske , and kampf@xcite found that the singlet - triplet excitation to be strongly renormalized when phonons of all wavenumber are taken into account , the restriction to solely the @xmath34 modes leading to a substantial overestimation of the spin gap .",
    "physically , this implies that the spin - triplet excitation is accompanied by a local distortion of the lattice , necessitating a multiphonon mode treatment of the ionic degrees of freedom .",
    "our recent work on the sp model has indicated that truncating the debye - phonon spectrum , leaving only those modes which couple directly to the peierls phase , is not physically quantitatively reasonable .",
    "we use the dmrg@xcite technique to numerically solve the ehp model for @xmath35 with a generalized gapped , dispersive phonon spectrum .",
    "the phonon spectrum interpolates between a gapped , dispersionless ( einstein ) limit and a gapless , dispersive ( debye ) limit .",
    "we proceed by considering a system of tightly - bound wannier electrons dressed with pure einstein phonons for which we observe a berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) quantum phase transition at a non - zero electron - lattice coupling . progressively increasing the debye character of the phonon dispersion ( at given optical phonon adiabaticity ) results in an increase in the critical value of the e - ph coupling , with the transition remaining in the bkt universality class ( see section [ bkt ] ) .",
    "these findings are corroborated by an array of independent verifications : energy - gap crossings in the spin excitation spectra ( see section [ gapc ] ) , finite - size scaling of the spin - gap ( see section [ fssg ] ) , and quantum bipartite entanglement ( see section [ bipent ] ) .",
    "our approach here is equivalent to that described in ref@xcite to investigate the bkt transition in the spin - peierls model .",
    "we note that earlier dmrg investigations of the ehp hamiltonian with debye phonons indicated a dimerized gs for arbitrary coupling@xcite .",
    "this conclusion was based on the behavior of the staggered phonon order parameter , which we have since shown to be an unreliable signature of the transition@xcite .",
    "we therefore pursue alternative characterizations of the peierls state in this work .    in the next section",
    "we describe the model , before discussing our results in section [ se:3 ] .",
