    "let me however stress that i do not mean to understate the fundamental problem of _ noise _ , which is here left aside ; rather , it is now being actively investigated in detail within the very convenient general framework set up below .",

    "in addition , two new tables and more mathematical detail have been added to its appendix b. the latter should help the interested reader with certain technicalities , while the tables and attendant new formulas are meant to provide explicit numerical values of the frequency spectrum of the sphere rather than the original _ only graphics _ information .",

    "spherical antennae are considered by many to be the natural next step in the development of resonant gw detectors .",
    "the reasons for this new trend essentially derive from the _ improved sensitivity _ of a sphere which can be nearly an order of magnitude better than a cylinder having the same resonance frequency , see below and  @xcite , and from its _ multimode capabilities _ ,",
    "first recognised by forward  @xcite and further elaborated in  @xcite .",
    "although some of the most relevant aspects of detector sensitivity have already received attention in the literature , it seems to me that a sufficiently general and flexible analysis of the interaction between gw and detector has not been satisfactorily developed to date .",
    "this _ theoretical _ shortage has a number of _ practical _ negative consequences , too .",
    "traditional analysis , to mention but an example , is almost invariably restricted to general relativity or scalar  tensor theories of gravity ; while it may be argued that this is already very general , any such argument is , as a matter of fact , understating the potentialities actually offered by a spherical gw antenna to help decide for or against any one specific theory of the gravitational field on the basis of _ experimental observation_.    i thus propose to develop in this paper a full fledged mathematical formalism which will enable analysis of the antenna s response to a completely general gw , i.e. , making no _ a priori _ assumptions about which is the correct theory underlying gw physics ( other than , indeed , that it is a _",
    "theory ) , _ and _ also making no assumptions about detector shape , structure or boundary conditions . considering things in such generality",
    "is not only `` theoretically nice '' it also brings about new results and a _",
    "better understanding _ of older ones .",
    "for example , it will be proved that the sphere is the _ most efficient _ gw elastic detector shape , and that higher mode absorption cross sections _ scale independently of gw physics_. i will also discuss the direction of incidence deconvolution problem in the context of a general metric theory of gravity .    the paper is organised as follows : section  2 is devoted to the development of the general mathematical framework , leading to a formula in which an elastic solid s response is related to the action of an arbitrary metric gw impinging on it . in section",
    "3 the general equations are applied to the homogeneous spherical body , and a discussion of the _ deconvolution _ problem is presented as well . section  4 contains the description of the sphere s sensitivity parameters , specifically leading to the concept of _ multimode _ , or vector , _ transfer function _ , and to an analysis of the _ absorption cross section _ presented by this detector to a passing by gw . conclusions and prospects are summarised in section  5 , and two appendices are added which include mathematical derivations .",
    "in the mathematical model , i shall be assuming that the antenna is a solid elastic body which responds to gw perturbations according to the equations of classical non - relativistic linear elasticity theory  @xcite .",
    "this is fully justified because gw - induced displacements will be very small indeed , and the speed of such displacements much smaller than that of light for any foreseeable frequencies .",
    "although our primary interest is a spherical antenna , the considerations which follow in the remainder of this section _ have general validity for arbitrarily shaped , isotropic elastic solids_.    let @xmath2 be the displacement vector of the infinitesimal mass element sitting at point * x * relative to the solid s centre of mass in its unperturbed state , whose density distribution in that state is @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath4 and @xmath5 be the material s elastic lam coefficients .",
    "if a volume force density @xmath6 acts on such solid , the displacement field @xmath2 is the solution to the system of partial differential equations  @xcite    @xmath7    with the appropriate initial and boundary conditions .",
    "a summary of notation and general results regarding the solution to that system is briefly outlined in the ensuing subsection , as they are necessary for the subsequent developments in this paper , and also in future work e.g .",
    "page   and ss .",
    "below .      for reasons which will become clear later on , we shall only be interested in driving forces of the separable type    @xmath8    or , indeed , linear combinations thereof .",
    "the solution to  ( [ 2.1 ] ) does not require us to specify the precise boundary conditions on @xmath2 at this stage , but we need to set the initial conditions .",
    "we adopt the following :    @xmath9    where  @xmath10 , implying that the antenna is at complete rest before observation begins at @xmath11=0 .",
    "the structure of the force field  ( [ 2.2 ] ) is such that the displacements @xmath2 can be expressed by means of a _ green function _ integral of the form    @xmath12    the deductive procedure whereby @xmath13 is calculated can be found in many standard textbooks see",
    "e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the result is    @xmath14      \\sum_n\\,\\mbox{\\large $ \\frac{f_n}{\\omega_n}$}\\ ,      { \\bf u}_n({\\bf x})\\sin\\omega_nt      & \\ \\",
    "{ \\rm if}\\ \\ t\\geq 0 \\end{array}\\right .    \\label{2.15}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath15    and @xmath16 are the normalised _ eigen ",
    "solutions _ to    @xmath17    with suitable _",
    "boundary conditions_. here @xmath18 represents an index , or set of indices , labelling the _ eigenmode _ of frequency  @xmath19 .",
    "the normalisation condition is ( arbitrarily ) chosen so that    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the total mass of the solid , and the asterisk denotes complex conjugation .",
    "replacing now  ( [ 2.15 ] ) into  ( [ 2.6 ] ) we can write the solution to our problem as a series expansion :    @xmath22    where    @xmath23    equation  ( [ 2.16 ] ) is the _ formal _ solution to our problem ; it has the standard form of an orthogonal expansion and is valid for _ any _ solid driven by a separable force like  ( [ 2.2 ] ) and _ any _ boundary conditions .",
    "it is therefore _",
    "completely general _ , given that type of force .",
    "before we go on , it is perhaps interesting to quote a simple but useful example",
    ". it is the case of a solid hit by a _",
    "hammer blow _ ,",
    "i.e. , receiving a sudden stroke at a point on its surface . exam of the response of a gw antenna to such perturbation is being used for correct tuning and monitoring of the device  @xcite .",
    "if the driving force density is represented by the simple model    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the surface point hit , and @xmath26 is a constant vector , then the system s response is immediately seen to be    @xmath27    with @xmath28 .",
    "a hammer blow thus excites _ all _ the solid s normal modes , except those _ perpendicular _ to @xmath26 , with amplitudes which are _ inversely proportional to the mode s frequency_. this is seen to be a rather general result in the theory of sound waves in isotropic elastic solids .",
    "an incoming gw manifests itself as a _ tidal _ force density ; in the long wavelength linear approximation  @xcite it only depends on the `` electric '' components of the riemann tensor :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the speed of light , and sum over the repeated index _",
    "j _ is understood . in  ( [ 3.1 ] ) tidal forces are referred to the antenna s centre of mass , and thus * x * is a vector originating there .",
    "note that i have omitted any dependence of @xmath0 on spatial coordinates , since it only needs to be evaluated at the solid s centre .",
    "the riemann tensor is only required to first order at this stage  @xcite :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 are the perturbations to flat geometry ) will run through space - time values 0,1,2,3 ; _ latin _ indices ( @xmath33 ) will run through space values 1,2,3 only .",
    "] , always at the centre of mass of the detector .",
    "the form  ( [ 3.1 ] ) is seen to be a sum of three terms like  ( [ 2.2 ] ) but this three term `` straightforward '' splitting is not the most convenient , due to lack of invariance and symmetry . a better choice is now outlined .",
    "an _ arbitrary symmetric _",
    "tensor @xmath34 admits the following decomposition :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 are 5 linearly independent _ symmetric _ and _ traceless _ tensors , and @xmath37 is a multiple of the _ unit _ @xmath38 are uniquely defined functions , whose explicit form depends on the particular representation of the chosen .",
    "a convenient one is the following :    & e_ij^(00 ) = ( ) ^ (    ccc 1 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 1 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 1    ) & [ 3.4a ] + & e_ij^(20 ) = ( ) ^ (    ccc -1 & 0 & 0 + 0 & -1 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 2    )  ,   e_ij^(21 ) = ( ) ^ (    ccc 0 & 0 & 1 + 0 & 0 & -i + 1 & -i & 0    ) & [ 3.4b ] + & e_ij^(22 ) = ( ) ^ (    ccc 1 & i & 0 + i & -1 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 0    ) & [ 3.4c ]    the excellence of this representation stems from its ability to display the _ spin features _ of the driving terms in  ( [ 3.1 ] ) .",
    "such features are characterised by the relationships    @xmath39    where * n*@xmath40*x*/@xmath41 is the radial unit vector , and @xmath42 are spherical harmonics  @xcite .",
    "details about the above @xmath43-matrices are given in appendix a. in particular , the orthogonality relations  ( [ a.9 ] ) can be used to invert  ( [ 3.3 ] ) :    ^(00)(t ) & = & e_ij^(00)s_ij(t ) [ 3.77a ] + s^(2m)(t ) & = & e_ij^*(2m)s_ij(t )  , m=-2,  ,2 [ 3.77b ]    where an asterisk denotes complex conjugation .",
    "note that @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the tensor s trace .",
    "we now take advantage of  ( [ 3.3 ] ) to express the gw tidal force  ( [ 3.1 ] ) as a sum of split terms like  ( [ 2.2 ] ) :    @xmath46    with    f_i^(00)(*x * ) = e_ij^(00)x_j  & , &   g^(00)(t ) = e_ij^*(00)r_0i0j(t)c^2 [ 3.8a ] + f_i^(2m)(*x * ) = e_ij^(2m)x_j  & , &   g^(2m)(t ) = e_ij^*(2m)r_0i0j(t)c^2 ( m = -2,  ,2 ) [ 3.8b ]    straightforward application of  ( [ 2.16 ] ) yields the formal solution of the antenna response to a gw perturbation :    @xmath47          \\label{3.9}\\ ] ]    with the notation of  ( [ 2.14 ] ) and  ( [ 2.17 ] ) applied _ mutatis mutandi _ to the terms in  ( [ 3.8 ] ) .",
    "equation  ( [ 3.9 ] ) gives the response of an arbitrary elastic solid to an incoming weak gw , _ independently of the underlying gravity theory _ , be it general relativity ( gr ) or indeed any other _",
    "metric _ theory of the gravitational interaction .",
    "it is also valid for _ any antenna shape _ and _ any boundary conditions _",
    ", thus giving the formalism , in particular , the capability of being used to study the response of a detector which is _ suspended _ by means of a mechanical device in the laboratory site a situation of much practical importance .",
    "it is therefore _ very _ general .",
    "equation  ( [ 3.9 ] ) also tells us that that only _ monopole _ and _ quadrupole detector modes _ can possibly be excited by a metric gw .",
    "the nice thing about  ( [ 3.9 ] ) is that it _",
    "fully _ displays the monopole - quadrupole _ structure _ of the solution to the fundamental differential equations  ( [ 2.1 ] ) .    in a non - symmetric body ,",
    "all ( or _ nearly _ all ) the modes have monopole and quadrupole moments , and  ( [ 3.9 ] ) precisely shows how much each of them contributes to the detector s response .",
    "a _ homogeneous spherical _ antenna , which is very symmetric , has a set of vibrational eigenmodes which are particularly well matched to the form  ( [ 3.9 ] ) : it only possesses _ one _ series of monopole modes and _ one _ ( five - fold degenerate ) series of quadrupole modes see next section and appendix b for details .",
    "the existence of so _ few _ modes which couple to gws means that _ all the absorbed incoming radiation energy will be distributed amongst those few modes only _",
    ", thereby making the sphere the _ most efficient _ detector , even from the sensitivity point of view . the higher energy cross section _ per unit",
    "mass _ reported for spheres on the basis of for example , finds here its qualitative explanation .",
    "the generality of  ( [ 3.9 ] ) , on the other hand , means that _ this excellence of the spherical detector is there independently of which is the correct gw theory_.    before going further , let me mention another potentially useful application of the formalism so far .",
    "cylindrical antennas , for instance , are usually studied in the _ thin rod _ approximation ; although this is generally quite satisfactory , equation  ( [ 3.9 ] ) offers the possibility of eventually considering corrections to such simplifying hypothesis by use of more realistic eigenfunctions , such as those given in  @xcite .",
    "recent new proposals for stumpy cylinder arrays  @xcite may well benefit from the above approach , too .",
    "to explore the consequences of  ( [ 3.9 ] ) in a particular case , the mode amplitudes @xmath16 and frequencies @xmath48 must be specified . from now on i will focus on a _ homogeneous sphere _ whose surface is free of tractions and/or tensions ; the latter happens to be quite a good approximation , even if the sphere is suspended in the static gravitational field  @xcite .",
    "the normal modes of the free sphere fall into two families : so called _ toroidal _ where the sphere only undergoes twisting which keep its shape unchanged throughout the volume and _ spheroidal _",
    "@xcite , where radial as well as tangential displacements take place .",
    "i use the notation    @xmath49    for them , respectively ; note that the index @xmath18 of the previous section is a _ multiple _ index @xmath50 for _",
    "each _ family ; @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the usual _ multipole _ indices , and @xmath53 numbers from 1 to @xmath54 each of the @xmath51-pole modes .",
    "the frequencies happen to be independent of @xmath55 , and so every one mode  ( [ 3.10 ] ) is ( 2@xmath51 + 1)-fold degenerate .",
    "further details about these eigenmodes are given in appendix b.    in order to see what  ( [ 3.9 ] ) looks like in this case , integrals of the form  ( [ 2.14 ] ) ought to be evaluated .",
    "it is straightforward to prove that they all vanish for the toroidal modes , the spheroidal modes contributing the only non - vanishing terms ; after some algebra one finds    @xmath56    where    a_n0 & = & -_0^r a_n0(r)r^3dr [ 3.12a ] + a_n2 & = & -_0^r r^3dr [ 3.12b ]    the functions @xmath57 , @xmath58 are given in appendix b , and @xmath59 is the sphere s radius .",
    "to our reassurance , only the monopole and quadrupole _ sphere modes _ survive , as seen by the presence of the factors @xmath60 in  ( [ 3.11 ] ) .",
    "the final series is thus a relatively simple one , even in spite of its generality , meaning _ spheroidal _ mode , to ease the notation since _ toroidal _",

    "let us first of all take the fourier transform of  ( [ 3.16 ] ) :    @xmath63    this is seen to be    @xmath64    \\",
    "+ \\nonumber \\\\*[1 em ]     & + & \\!\\frac{\\pi}{i}\\,\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\,\\frac{a_{n2}}{\\omega_{n2 } }     \\left[\\sum_{m=-2}^2\\,{\\bf u}_{n2m}({\\bf x})\\,g^{(2m)}(\\omega)\\right ]     \\left[\\delta(\\omega\\!-\\!\\omega_{n2 } ) - \\delta(\\omega\\!+\\ !",

    "if the measuring system were ( ideally ) sensitive to all frequencies , filters could be applied to examine the antenna s oscillations at each monopole and quadrupole frequency : a single transducer would suffice to reveal @xmath69 around the monopole frequencies @xmath70 , whilst _ five _ ( placed at suitable positions ) would be required to calculate the five degenerate amplitudes @xmath71 around the quadrupole frequencies @xmath72 . once the _ six _ functions @xmath65 would have thus been determined , inverse fourier transforms would give us the functions @xmath66 , and thereby the six riemann tensor components @xmath73 through inversion of the second of equations  ( [ 3.8 ] ) , i.e. , as an expansion like  ( [ 3.3 ] ) only with @xmath74 s instead of @xmath75 s .",
    "deconvolution would then be complete .",
    "well , not quite ",
    "knowledge of the riemann tensor in the _ laboratory _ frame coordinates is not really sufficient to say the waveform has been completely deconvolved , unless we _ also _ know the _ source position _ in the sky .",
    "there clearly are two possibilities :    1 .",
    "the source position _ is _ known ahead of time by some other astronomical observation methods .",
    "let me rush to emphasise that , far from trivial or uninteresting , this is a _ very important _ case to consider , specially during the first stages of gw astronomy , when any reported gw event will have to be thoroughly checked by all possible means .",
    "+ if the incidence direction is known , then a rotation must be applied to the just obtained quantities @xmath73 , which takes the laboratory into coincidence with the incoming wave propagation vector . a classification procedure",
    "must thereafter be applied to the so transformed riemann tensor in order to see which is the theory ( or class of theories ) compatible with the actual observations .",
    "such classification procedure has been described in detail in  @xcite ; see also  @xcite for an updated discussion .",
    "+ the spherical antenna is thus seen to have the _ capability of furnishing the analyst sufficient information to discern amongst different competing theories of gw physics , whenever the wave incidence direction is known prior to detection_. 2 .",
    "the source position is _ not _ known at detection time .",
    "this makes things more complex , since the above rotation between the laboratory and gw frames can not be performed . + in order to deconvolve the incidence direction in this case , a specific theory of the gws _",
    "must _ be assumed a given choice being made on the basis of whatever prior information is available or , simply , dictated by the the decision to probe a particular theory .",
    "wagoner and paik  @xcite propose a method which is useful both for gr and bd theory , their idea being simple and elegant at the same time : since neither of these theories predicts the excitation of the @xmath52=@xmath761 quadrupole modes _ of the wave _ , the source position is determined precisely by the rotation angles which , when applied to the laboratory axes , cause the amplitudes of those _ antenna _ modes to vanish ; the rotated frame is thereby associated to the gw natural frame . +",
    "a generalisation of this idea can conceivably be found on the basis of a detailed and possibly rather casuistic analysis of the canonical forms of of the riemann tensor for a list of theories of gravity , along the following line of argument : any one particular theory will be characterised by certain ( homogeneous ) canonical relationships amongst the monopole and quadrupole components of the riemann tensor , @xmath66 , and so enforcement of those relations upon rotation of the laboratory frame axes should enable determination of the rotation angles or , equivalently , of the incoming radiation incidence direction .",
    "scalar - tensor theories e.g. have @xmath77 in their canonical forms , hence wagoner and paik s proposal for this particular case . + before any deconvolution procedure is triggered , however , it is very important to make sure that it will be _",
    "viable_. more precisely , since the transformation from the laboratory to the ultimate canonical frame is going to be linear , _ invariants _ must be preserved .",
    "this means that , even if the source position is unknown , certain theories will forthrightly be _ vetoed _ by the observed @xmath73 if their predicted invariants are incompatible with the observed ones . to give but an easy example ,",
    "if @xmath73 is _ observed _ to have a non - null trace @xmath78 , then a veto on gr will be readily served , and therefore no algorithm based on that theory should be applied  @xcite .",
    "+ i would like to make a final remark here .",
    "assume a direction deconvolution procedure has been successfully carried through to the end on the basis of certain gw theory , so that the analyst comes up with a pair of numbers @xmath79 expressing the source s coordinates in the sky .",
    "of course , these numbers will represent the _ actual _ source position _ only if the assumed theory is correct_. now , how do we know it _ is _ correct ? strictly speaking , `` correctness '' of a scientific theory is an",
    "_ asymptotic _",
    "concept in the sense that the possibility always remains open that new facts be eventually discovered which contradict the theory , and so _ reliability _ of the estimate @xmath79 of the source position can only be assessed in practice in terms of the _ consistency _ between the assumed theory and whatever experimental evidence is available _ to date _ , including , indeed , gw measurements themselves .",
    "it is thus very important to have a method to verify that the estimate @xmath79 does not contradict the theory which enabled its very determination .",
    "+ such verification is a _ logical _ absurdity if only _",
    "one _ measurement of position is available ; this happens for instance if the recorded signal is a _ short burst _ of radiation , and so _ two antennas _ are at least necessary to check consistency in that case .",
    "the test would proceed as a check that the time delay between reception of the signal at both detectors is consistent with the calculated @xmath79 , even if the assumed theory is wrong , since the sphere deformations will be the same if caused by the same signal .",
    "] , given their relative position and the wave propagation speed predicted by the assumed theory .",
    "if , on the other hand , the signal being tracked is a _ long duration _",
    "signal , then a single antenna may be sufficient to perform the test by looking at the observed doppler patterns and checking them against those expected with the given @xmath79 .",
    "the above considerations have been made ignoring noise in the detector and monitor systems .",
    "a fundamental constraint introduced by noise is that it makes the antenna _ bandwidth limited _ in sensitivity . as a consequence ,",
    "any deconvolution procedure is deemed to be incomplete or , rather , _ ambiguous _",
    "@xcite , since information about the signal can possibly be retrieved only within a reduced bandwidth , whilst the rest will be lost .",
    "i thus come to a detailed discussion of the sensitivity of the spherical gw antenna in the next section .",
    "i will consider successively _ amplitude _ and _ energy _ sensitivities ; the first leads to the concept of _ transfer function _ , while the second to that of absorption _ cross section_. i devote separate subsections to analyse each of them in some detail .",
    "a widely used and useful concept in linear system theory is that of _ transfer function _",
    "it is defined as the fourier transform of the system s impulse response , or as the system s impedance / admittance , and can be inferred from the frequency response function  ( [ 3.18 ] ) .",
    "we recall from the previous section that the sphere is a multimode device due to its monopole and five - fold degenerate quadrupole modes .",
    "it is expedient to define a _",
    "multimode _ or _ vector transfer function _ as a useful construct which encompasses all six different modes into a single conceptual block , according to    @xmath80    where @xmath81 are the six driving terms @xmath65 given in  ( [ 3.19 ] ) .",
    "the transfer function is @xmath82 , and its `` vector '' character alluded above is reflected by the _ multimode index _ @xmath83 .",
    "looking at  ( [ 3.18 ] ) it is readily seen that    ^(00)(*x * , ) & = & _ n=1^ * u*_n00(*x*)[4.2a ] + * z*^(2m)(*x * , ) & = & _ n=1^ * u*_n2m(*x*)(m=-2,  ,2 ) [ 4.2b ]    as we observe in these formulae , the sphere s sensitivity to monopole excitations is governed by @xmath84 , and to quadrupole ones by @xmath85 .",
    "closed expressions happen to exist for @xmath86 and @xmath87 ; using the notation of appendix b , they are    & = & [ 4.4a ] + & = & -[4.4b ]    numerical investigation of the behaviour of these coefficients shows that they decay asymptotically as @xmath88 :    @xmath89    likewise , it is found that the frequencies @xmath90 and @xmath91 diverge like @xmath53 for large @xmath92 , so that @xmath82 drops as @xmath93 for large @xmath94 .",
    "figures 6 and 7 display a symbolic plot of @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively , which illustrates the situation : monopole modes soon reach the asymptotic regime , while there appear to be 3 sub - families of quadrupole modes regularly intertwined ; the asymptotic regime for these sub - families is more irregularly reached .",
    "note also the perfectly regular alternate changes of phase ( by @xmath97 radians ) in both monopole and each quadrupole family .",
    "the sharp fall in sensitivity of a sphere for higher frequency modes ( @xmath98 ) indicates that only the lowest ones stand a chance of being observable in an actual gw antenna .",

    "for let @xmath253 be a set of resonator locations , for example the _ tiga _ or the _ phc _ positions , and let @xmath254 be the real ones , close to the former :      the values @xmath256 determine the eigenvalues @xmath257 in equation  ( [ 5.2 ] ) , and they also appear as arguments to the spherical harmonics in the system response functions of sections  [ sec : srgw][sec : hs ] .",
    "it follows from  ( [ 8.10 ] ) by continuity arguments that      inspection of the equations of sections  [ sec : srgw][sec : hs ] shows that both @xmath257 and @xmath258 _ always _ appear within lowest order terms , and hence that corrections to them of the type  ( [ 8.105 ] ) will affect those terms in _ second order _ again .",
    "we thus conclude that the system is also _ robust _ to small misalignments of the resonators relative to pre - established positions .          to assess the consequences of this , however , we must go back to equation ( [ 3.18 ] ) and see what the coefficients in its series solutions of the type  ( [ 4.11.a ] ) are .",
    "the procedure is very similar to that of section  [ s8.1 ] , and will not be repeated here ; the lowest order coefficient @xmath260 is seen to satisfy the algebraic equation      which reduces to  ( [ 5.1 ] ) when all the @xmath262 s vanish , as expected .",
    "this appears to potentially have significant effects on our results to lowest order in @xmath252 , but a more careful consideration of the facts shows that it is probably unrealistic to think of such large tolerances in resonator manufacturing as implied by equation  ( [ 8.11 ] ) in the first place . in the _ tiga _ experiment , for example  @xcite , an error of order @xmath252 would amount to around 50 hz of mistuning between resonators , an absurd figure by all means . in a full scale sphere",
    "( @xmath24840 tons , @xmath2483 metres in diameter , @xmath248800 hz fundamental quadrupole frequency , @xmath249@xmath24810@xmath263 ) the same error would amount to between 5 hz and 10 hz in resonator mistunings for the lowest frequency .",
    "this is probably excessive for a capacitive transducer , but may be realistic for an inductive one . with this exception ,",
    "it is thus more appropriate to consider that resonator mistunings are at least of order @xmath249 .",
    "if this is the case , though , we see once more that the system is quite insensitive to such mistunings .    summing up the results of this section",
    ", one can say that the resonator system dynamics is quite _ robust _ to small ( of order @xmath252 ) changes in its various parameters .",
    "the important exception is of course the effect of suspension drilling , which do result in significant changes relative to the ideally perfect device , but which can be relatively easily calculated .",
    "the theoretical picture is fully supported by experiment , as _ robustness _ in the parameters here considered has been reported in the real device  @xcite .            where @xmath165 is a suitable label .",
    "it is recalled from reference  @xcite that , in such circumstances , a formal solution can be written down for equation  ( [ 2.1.a ] ) in terms of a _ green function integral _ , whereby the following orthogonal series expansion obtains :          here , @xmath48 and @xmath16 are the eigenfrequencies and associated normalised wave - functions of the free sphere . also , @xmath18 is an abbreviation for a multiple index @xmath50 .",
    "the generic index @xmath83 is a label for the different pieces of interaction happening in the system .",
    "i quote the result of the calculations of the terms needed in this paper :              where the label `` external '' explicitly refers to agents acting upon the system from outside .",
    "two kinds of such external actions are considered in this article : those due to gws and those due to a calibration hammer stroke signal . specifying *",
    "x*=@xmath268 in the lhs of  ( [ m3.6 ] ) and multiply on either side by @xmath253 , the following is readily found :              the following bare sphere responses to gws and hammer strokes ( equations!([1.1 ] ) and  ( [ 2.5 ] ) , respectively ) can be calculated by direct substitution .",
    "the results as best presented as laplace transform domain functions :                                    we must first isolate @xmath284 , then find inverse laplace transforms to revert to time domain quantities .",
    "substituting the values of @xmath285 and @xmath286 from  ( [ 6.2.a ] ) and  ( [ 4.85 ] ) into  ( [ a2.1 ] ) we find                  clearly thus , the _ poles _ of @xmath291 must be determined in the first place .",
    "it is immediately clear from equation  ( [ 6.4 ] ) that there are no poles at either @xmath293=0 , or @xmath293=@xmath294 , or @xmath293=@xmath295 , for there are exactly compensated infinities at these locations .",
    "the only possible poles lie at those values of @xmath293 for which the matrix in square brackets in  ( [ 6.4 ] ) is not invertible , and these of course correspond to the zeroes of its determinant , i.e. ,      there are infinitely many roots for equation  ( [ m3.18 ] ) , but _",
    "analytic _ expressions can not be found for them .",
    "_ perturbative _ approximations in terms of the small parameter @xmath249 will thus be applied instead .",
    "it is assumed that          since @xmath249 is a small parameter , the _ denominators _ of the fractions in the different terms in square brackets in  ( [ m4.9 ] ) must be _ quantities of order @xmath249 _ at the root locations for the determinant to vanish at them .",
    "a distinction however arises depending on whether @xmath300 is close to @xmath301 or to the other @xmath302 .",
    "there are accordingly two categories of roots , more precisely :      ) in the complex @xmath293plane for @xmath152 tuned to the lowest frequency of the sphere s spectrum .",
    "note that @xmath303 is closer to @xmath304 than @xmath305 are to @xmath306 ; this is a consequence of the differences being proportional to @xmath249 and @xmath252 , respectively , as seen in equations ( [ m4.11 ] ) .",
    "[ fig9],width=491 ]    figure [ fig9 ] provides a visual characterisation of these roots .",
    "the coefficients @xmath260 , @xmath247 , ... and @xmath307 , @xmath307 , ... can be calculated recursively , starting form the first , by substitution of the corresponding series expansions into equation  ( [ m4.9 ] ) .",
    "the lowest order terms are easily seen to be given by          respectively . both equations  ( [ 5.1 ] ) and  ( [ 5.4 ] ) are algebraic eigenvalue equations .",
    "as shown in appendix  [ app : c ] , the matrix @xmath310 has at most @xmath311 non - null positive eigenvalues all the rest up to @xmath250 are identically zero .    as a final step we must evaluate  ( [ 6.6 ] ) .",
    "this is accomplished by standard textbook techniques ( see e.g.  @xcite ) ; the algebra is quite straightforward but rather lengthy , and i shall not delve into its details here , but quote only the most interesting results .",
    "it appears that the _ dominant _ contribution to @xmath290 comes from the poles at the locations  ( [ 4.11.a ] ) , whereas all other poles only contribute as higher order corrections ; generically , @xmath290 is seen to have the form                  this appendix presents a few important properties of the matrix @xmath315 for arbitrary @xmath51 and resonator locations @xmath253 ( @xmath316=1,  ,@xmath250 ) which are useful for detailed system resonance characterisation .",
    "equation  ( [ ma.3 ] ) indicates that the _ rank _ of the matrix @xmath319 can not exceed @xmath311 , as there are only @xmath311 kets @xmath321 .",
    "so , if @xmath250@xmath324@xmath311 then it has at least @xmath325 identically null eigenvalues there can be more if some of the @xmath253 s are parallel , as this causes rows ( or columns ) of @xmath319 to be repeated .                in other words , @xmath328 are the eigenvalues of the @xmath311@xmath320@xmath311 matrix @xmath331 , which is positive definite because so is the `` scalar product '' @xmath332 .",
    "all of them are therefore strictly positive .",

    "a spherical gw antenna is a natural multi - mode device with very rich potential capabilities to detect gws on earth .",
    "but such detector is not just a bare sphere , it requires a set of _ motion sensors _ to be practically useful .",
    "it appears that transducers of the _ resonant _ type are the best suited ones for an efficient performance of the detector .",
    "resonators however significantly interact with the sphere , and they affect in particular its frequency spectrum and vibration modes in a specific fashion , which must be properly understood before reliable conclusions can be drawn from the system readout .    the main objective of this paper has been the construction and development of an elaborate theoretical model to describe the joint dynamics of a solid elastic sphere and a set of _ radial motion _",
    "resonators attached to its surface at arbitrary locations , with the purpose to make predictions of the system characteristics and response , in principle with arbitrary mathematical precision .    the solutions to the equations of motion have been shown to be expressible as an ascending series in powers of the small `` coupling constant '' @xmath249 , the ratio of the average resonator mass to the mass of the larger sphere .",
    "the _ lowest order _",
    "approximation corresponds to terms of order @xmath252 and , to this order , previous results  @xcite are recovered .",
    "this , i hope , should contribute to clarify the nature of the approximations inherent in earlier approaches , and to better understand the physical reason for their remarkable accuracy  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the methods of this paper have permitted us to discover that there can be in fact transducer layouts alternative to the highly symmetric _ tiga _ , and having potentially interesting practical properties .",
    "an example is the _ phc _ distribution , which is based on a pentagonally symmetric set of 5 rather than 6 resonators per quadruopole mode sensed .",
    "this transducer distribution has the property that _ mode channels _ can be constructed from the resonators readouts , much in the same way as in the _ tiga _  @xcite . in the _ phc",
    "_ however a new and distinctive characteristic is present : different _ wave amplitudes _ selectively couple to different _ detector modes _ having different frequencies , so that the antenna s mode channels come at different rather than equal frequencies .",
    "phc _ philosophy can be extended to make a _ multi - frequency _ system by using resonators tuned to the first two quadrupole harmonics of the sphere _ and _ to the first monopole , an altogether 11 transducer set .",
    "the assessment of _ symmetry failure _ effects , as well as other parameter departures form ideality , has also been subjected to analysis .",
    "the general scheme is again seen to be very well suited for the purpose , as the theory transparently shows that the system is _ robust _ against relative disturbances of order @xmath249 or smaller in any system parameters , also providing a systematic procedure to assess larger tolerances up to order @xmath252 .",
    "the system is shown to still be robust to tolerances of this order in some of its parameters , whilst it is not to others .",
    "included in the latter group is the effect of spherical symmetry breaking due to system suspension in the laboratory , which causes _ degeneracy lifting _ of the sphere s eigenfrequencies , which split up into multiplets .",
    "a strong point is that , by use of mostly analytic algorithms , it has been possible to accurately reproduce the reportedly measured frequencies of the _ lsu _ prototype antenna  @xcite with the predicted precision of four decimal places .",
    "the also reported robustness of the system to resonator mislocations  @xcite is too in satisfactory agreement with the theoretical predictions .",
    "the perturbative approach here adopted is naturally open to refined analysis of the system response in higher orders in @xmath249 .",
    "for example , one can systematically address the weaker coupling of non - quadrupole modes , etc .",
    "it appears however that such refinements will be largely masked by _",
    "noise _ in a real system , as shown by merkowitz and johnson  @xcite , and this must therefore be considered first .",
    "so the next step is to include noise in the model and see its effect .",
    "stevenson  @xcite has already made some progress in this direction , and partly assessed the characteristics of _ tiga _ and _ phc _ , but more needs to be done since not too high signal - to - noise ratios should realistically be be considered in an actual gw detector . in particular ,",
    "_ mode channels _ are at the basis of noise correlations and dependencies , as well as the errors in gw parameter estimation  @xcite .",
    "i do expect the analytic tools developed in this article to provide a powerful framework to address the fundamental problems of _ noise _ in a spherical gw antenna which , to my knowledge , have not yet received the detailed attention they require ."
