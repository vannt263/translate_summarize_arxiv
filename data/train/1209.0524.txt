    "variability is one of the major characteristics of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , whose luminosities vary in all the bands from @xmath0-ray to radio , on timescales from hours to years .",
    "although the study of variability plays an important role in investigating the nature of the compact central region in agns @xcite , the mechanism underlying quasar variability is still inconclusive .",
    "several physical mechanisms have been proposed to explain quasar variability @xcite , including accretion disk instabilities @xcite , poissonian processes , such as multiple supernovae or star collisions @xcite , and gravitational microlensing @xcite .    to clarify the nature of quasar variability , most previous studies focused on the dependencies of the variability indicator on redshift , time lag , rest - frame wavelength and luminosity .",
    "a decrease of variability was found towards longer wavelengths @xcite , but the influences of other parameters on the correlation were not excluded due to small samples .",
    "@xcite confirmed such an anti - correlation by excluding the dependencies of variability on redshift and luminosity , however , for the scarcity of data points of each quasar , they estimated one variability indicator from a sample of quasars ( the ensemble variability method ) rather than from an individual quasar ( the individual variability method ) .",
    "this ignores the diversity of an individual quasar light curve , which may eventually fade out the actual relations . due to the statistical incompleteness of small samples",
    ", previous studies found controversial evidences for the dependencies of variability on redshift and luminosity @xcite .",
    "thus , the results may not be statistically reliable due to possible dependencies of variability on other parameters . only recently , with larger samples , some work managed to disentangle the anti - correlation between the variability amplitude and luminosity by restricting other parameters in small ranges @xcite .",
    "however , they still adopted the ensemble variability method to estimate the variability indicator .",
    "moreover , as @xcite only studied quasars with redshift larger than 1.69 , the situation for quasars with lower redshifts were still unknown .",
    "besides luminosity , more attention has been paid to investigate the influences on variability from other intrinsic parameters , i.e. , black hole mass and eddington ratio ( the ratio of bolometric luminosity to eddington luminosity ) .",
    "@xcite found a correlation between variability and black hole mass from about 100 quasars , without accounting for the influences of other parameters .",
    "based on their ensemble variability study of nearly 23,000 quasars from the palomar quest survey , @xcite found the dependencies of quasar variability on black hole mass ( positively ) , and eddington ratio ( negatively ) .",
    "similar conclusions were reached by @xcite based on the individual variability indicators but without disentangling the relations between these parameters .",
    "although variability depends on many parameters , the underlying physical mechanisms are still uncertain .",
    "dividing the sample according to different parameter bins is essential to analyze their influences on variability .",
    "moreover , to avoid missing the diversity of the individual quasar light curve , the detailed variability indicator of each quasar rather than the ensemble variability indicator from a group of quasars , should also be utilized .",
    "however , no previous work has employed the two essential methods simultaneously in their correlation analysis .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the correlations between the variability amplitude and physical parameters based on a sample of 7658 quasars in sdss stripe 82 , with both the individual variability method and the detailed parameter binning techniques .",

    ", we exclude data points with very faint luminosity , i.e. , magnitude fainter than 30 .",
    "data points with large photometric uncertainties ( errors larger than 1 magnitude ) are also excluded .",
    "photometric measurements are marked as outliers if the residuals between them and their median magnitude of all the preliminarily cleaned data points are above 5 times their standard deviation .",
    "this procedure is iterated until all the outliers are excluded , each time removing only the strongest outlier and updating the median magnitude along with the standard deviation for the remaining measurements . after eliminating all the assumed non - physical outliers ,",
    "if more than 10 cleaned data points remained , we calculate the variability amplitude with the equations mentioned above .",
    "otherwise , variability amplitudes are set to be 0 . to get more reliable statistical results , in the following studies we only investigate quasar variability amplitudes in the sdss @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 band , as photometric errors in the @xmath26 and @xmath27 band are substantially larger @xcite . among the 9148 quasars with measurable black hole mass @xcite , 8967 quasars have reliable variability indicators in the @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 band , which means",
    "that variability in each band for a quasar is a non - zero value estimated from at least 10 data points , even after eliminating photometric outliers .",
    "since the physical origin of optical variability in radio - quiet and radio - loud quasars may be different @xcite , among the 8967 quasars , we divide the 7658 quasars with either radio detections or in the fields of the first radio survey into two subsamples @xcite : the radio - quiet subsample contains quasars with radio loudness below 10 ; the radio - loud subsample holds quasars with radio loudness above 10 . here",
    "radio loudness is defined as the ratio of the observed radio flux density at rest - frame @xmath28 cm and the optical flux density at rest - frame 2500 @xcite .",
    "416 radio - loud sources and 7242 radio - quiet sources are obtained for the study in the following sections .    from fig .",
    "[ sigma_distribution ] , we can see that the variability amplitudes of the radio - quiet and the radio - loud quasars are mostly distributed between 0.05 mag and 0.3 mag , except that there is a relatively higher fraction of the radio - loud quasars ( @xmath29 2.96% ) with variability amplitudes larger than 0.3 mag compared to that of the radio - quiet quasars ( @xmath29 1.73% ) .",
    "the median variability amplitude of the radio - quiet objects in the @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 band are 0.125@xmath300.071 mag , 0.106@xmath300.060 mag and 0.095@xmath300.057 mag and that of the radio - loud objects are 0.127@xmath300.096 mag , 0.106@xmath300.081 mag and 0.096@xmath300.078 mag respectively .",
    "therefore , the median variability amplitude of the radio - quiet objects is very similar compared to that of the radio - loud quasars .",

    "if both the difference of time in which the quasar luminosity of two adjacent bands show their brightest state and the difference of time when luminosity of two adjacent bands show their faintest state are less than 2 days , then these quasars are selected to study the quasar color behavior .",

    "<S> we investigate the optical variability of 7658 quasars from sdss stripe 82 . taking advantage of a larger sample and relatively more data points for each quasar , we estimate variability amplitudes and divide the sample into small bins of redshift , rest - frame wavelength , black hole mass , eddington ratio and bolometric luminosity respectively , to investigate the relationships between variability and these parameters . an anti - correlation between variability and rest - frame wavelength </S>",

    "<S> the variability amplitude of radio - quiet quasars shows almost no cosmological evolution , but that of radio - loud ones may weakly anti - correlate with redshift . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , variability increases as either luminosity or eddington ratio decreases . </S>",
    "<S> however , the relationship between variability and black hole mass is uncertain ; it is negative when the influence of eddington ratio is excluded , but positive when the influence of luminosity is excluded . </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic distribution of variability amplitudes for radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars are different . </S>",
    "<S> both radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars exhibit a bluer - when - brighter chromatism . assuming that quasar variability is caused by variations of accretion rate </S>",
    "<S> , the shakura - sunyaev disk model can reproduce the tendencies of observed correlations between variability and rest - frame wavelength , luminosity as well as eddington ratio , supporting that changes of accretion rate plays an important role in producing the observed optical variability . </S>",
    "<S> however , the predicted positive correlation between variability and black hole mass seems to be inconsistent with the observed negative correlation between them in small bins of eddington ratio , which suggests that other physical mechanisms may still need to be considered in modifying the simple accretion disk model . </S>"
