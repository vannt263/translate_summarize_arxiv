    "it is generally accepted that the free magnetic energy stored in the coronal magnetic field is explosively released through magnetic reconnection @xcite , a process in which oppositely - directed magnetic field lines break and reconnect with each other in a small area in the corona .",
    "the residual magnetic tension in the newly - reconnected field causes the magnetic field and plasma to be expelled from both sides of the reconnection region , forming high - speed outflows at near - alfvn speed ( @xmath0thousands of km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "indirect observational evidence have been found in past studies , e.g. , the separation motion of flare ribbons formed in the lower atmosphere , cusp - shaped soft x - ray flare loops @xcite , loop - top hard x - ray sources @xcite , and double hard x - ray sources above the flare loop top with opposite temperature gradients @xcite .",
    "the search for inflows and outflows is important since they are direct consequence of the reconnection process and their measurements can yield estimates of the reconnection rate .",
    "there have been some observations interpreted as the inflow or outflow .",
    "apparent bidirectional motion of coronal structures around a flare loop discovered with soho / eit has been considered to be the signature of reconnection inflow @xcite . there has been , however , only indirect evidence of reconnection outflows , mostly based on morphological changes .",
    "for example , plasma blob ejections @xcite and downward plasma motions @xcite seen in x - ray images were thought to be a consequence of upward or downward outflows , but the deduced outflow velocities are much lower than predicted values . in this paper , we present the first direct measurement of high - speed reconnection outflows in a flare event using combined imaging and spectroscopic observations .",
    "the flare studied in the paper occurred very close to the northwest limb of the sun in the active region noaa 9901 on 16 april 2002 .",
    "it was a goes m2.5-class flare and associated with a slow coronal mass ejection @xcite .",
    "the x - ray light curves in two energy bands ( 6@xmath112 and 25@xmath150  kev ) obtained with the ramaty high - energy solar spectroscopic imager ( rhessi ) are shown in figure  [ cur]_a_. the flare started with enhancement in soft x - rays at 12:52  ut .",
    "the impulsive phase as shown in @xmath325  kev hard x - ray ( hxr ) started at 13:06 ut and lasted @xmath011  min .",
    "the rhessi x - ray images below 25 kev show a compact flare loop and a separated , outward moving coronal source ( fig .",
    "[ lop ] , contour images ) .",
    "figure  [ lop ] also shows the 195   bandpass images obtained with the transition region and coronal explorer ( trace ) , in which a bright , compact loop and a faint , outward moving loop can be identified .",
    "@xcite reported that the faint loop was rising with a velocity of 45@xmath175 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the outward moving x - ray coronal source appeared to be trailing the front of the large - scale loop seen in trace images ( indicated by an arrow in fig .",
    "[ lop ] ) .",
    "the flare was observed throughout its duration by the solar ultraviolet measurements of emitted radiation ( sumer ) spectrometer on soho with the 300@xmath4 entrance slit at a fixed position above the active region ( figs .",
    "[ lop ] and [ jet]_a _ ) .",
    "the spectra were recorded with a 50  s cadence in three lines : si  iii 1113.2  ( 0.06 mk ) , ca  x 557.7  ( 2nd order , 0.6 mk ) , and fe  xix 1118.1  ( 8 mk ) .",
    "figure  [ cur]_b _ shows the time series of the fe  xix line intensity profiles along the slit . from 12:58 to 13:04",
    "ut , the line intensity increased significantly , appearing as a crescent - shaped structure passing the slit .",
    "the timing and location ( relative to the slit ) of this structure suggest that it is the moving , large - scale ( faint ) loop seen by trace ( see fig .",
    "[ lop ] ) .",
    "this structure is not seen in the sumer cooler ca  x line ( fig .",
    "[ jet]_b _ ) , indicating that the loop seen at trace 195 bandpass was due to emissions of hotter lines ( i.e. , ca  xvii 193    at 5 mk and fe  xxiv 192    at 20 mk ) @xcite . after the passage of this rising loop , the fe  xix intensity decreased by about an order of magnitude ( from @xmath013:04 to 13:08 ut ) .",
    "then it gradually increased again over a larger region , seen as a cusp - shaped brightening ( fig .",
    "[ cur]_b _ ) , which indicates apparently - growing hot , dense cusp - shaped loops across the slit .",
    "this could be the evidence of progressive reconnection of field lines towards higher altitudes in time .",
    "the most striking signature in sumer observations is a plasma jet with a large blue - shift in the fe  xix line ( figs .",
    "[ jet]_b _ and [ spc ] ) lasting for @xmath08 min during the impulsive phase of the flare .",
    "the jet had a width of @xmath06@xmath5 along the slit , and was located at @xmath05@xmath5 south of the top of the faint , rising loop .",
    "this high blue - shift jet was first seen at 13:05 ut , when the main impulsive phase of the flare started as revealed by the rhessi 25 - 50  kev light curve ( fig .",
    "[ cur]_a _ ) . at this time , both the top of the erupting hot loop seen by sumer and trace and the x - ray coronal source seen by rhessi had passed the slit . therefore , the high - speed outflow was trailing the coronal features moving outwards .",
    "the fe  xix line profile shows blue - shift component corresponding to a line - of - sight doppler velocity of up to 600  km  s@xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ jet]_c _ ) . taking into account the projection effect",
    ", the outflow velocity can be as high as 1800@xmath13500  km  s@xmath2 ( see discussions in sect  [ dis ] ) .",
    "figure  [ spc ] shows the jet evolution as observed in fe  xix spectra .",
    "we do not see any significant change in the line profile during the first 4 min , although the line intensity continued to increase ( fig .",
    "[ cur]_a _ , green line ) .",
    "the jet became weaker after 13:10  ut , and eventually disappeared at 13:14  ut .    a high red - shift jet in the fe  xix line ,",
    "although not as strong as the blue - shift jet , is also observed after 13:16  ut ( fig .",
    "[ spc ] , bottom row ) .",
    "this indicates a downward - moving plasma flow passing through the slit .",
    "the red - shift jet was at @xmath05@xmath5 north of the blue - shift jet .",
    "the maximum doppler velocity was 300  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "with the projection effect corrected , we get a downward velocity between 900 and 1800 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this red - shift jet disappeared after 13:21  ut when the 25 - 50  kev hxr emission dropped to the background level ( fig .",
    "[ cur]_a _ ) .",
    "we note that , since the blue - shift jet seen by sumer was located near the southern leg of the rising faint loop seen by trace ( fig .  [ lop ] , panels 3@xmath15 ) , it may be falsely interpreted as the signature of upward flows in the loop .",
    "however , there are several arguments against such an interpretation : ( 1 ) as both the northern and southern legs of the rising loop crossed the slit , if the blue shift is caused by the upward flow in the loop , then we would expect to see two strong doppler - shift jets along the slit ; ( 2 ) after the southern leg of the trace loop passed through the jet location , we still observed the high blue - shift jet ( fig .",
    "[ lop ] , bottom right panel ) .",
    "( 3 ) a plasma flow with such a high speed is not expected and has never been reported in erupting loops .    by combining all the observations presented above ,",
    "we conclude that the observed upward and downward jets are both high - speed outflows from the magnetic reconnection site .",
    "when the upflowing jet was observed , the reconnection site was below the slit and later when the downflowing jet was observed , the reconnection site had moved above the slit .",
    "we interpret the essential observations in terms of the standard magnetic reconnection picture : ( 1 ) the initial faint , rising loop observed with sumer and trace is an erupting ( twisted ) flux rope , below which magnetic reconnection took place .",
    "the high temperature ( @xmath36 mk ) of this loop suggests the presence of a pre - heating process which may be involved in the trigger of its eruption .",
    "( 2 ) at the onset of the flare impulsive phase , the high - speed upflows were expelled outward from the magnetic reconnection region .",
    "this plasma upflow passed through the sumer slit and produced the high blue - shift jet seen in the fe  xix line .",
    "the estimated upflow speed agrees with the typical alfvn speed in the corona .",
    "( 3 ) after the reconnection site ( e.g. , current sheet ) passed through the slit , the observation showed the cusp - shaped , newly - reconnected field retracting downwards and forming reconnection downflows , which were observed as the red - shift jet by sumer . the relatively smaller downflow velocity may imply that the downflow is slowed down by the density increase due to chromospheric evaporation along the reconnected loops .",
    "similar asymmetry between upflow and downflow velocities was also found in bi - directional jets observed in explosive events in the solar chromosphere @xcite .",
    "( 4 ) after the impulsive phase , the reconnection rate decreased significantly ( inferred from its temporal correlation with hard x - ray flux , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and , therefore , no high - speed reconnection outflow can be detected with sumer .",
    "( 5 ) the narrow width of the observed outflows suggests the presence of a vertical current sheet in side view . ( 6 ) the x - ray coronal source is closer to the reconnection region than the rising loop , therefore , it has a higher temperature ( 30  mk ) @xcite .",
    "both this above - the - loop x - ray coronal source and the lower compact x - ray source could be heated by termination shocks formed by the reconnection outflows above and below the current sheet @xcite .",
    "these interpretations are consistent with the results of @xcite . based on the rhessi observations that the temperature of the flare loop increased toward higher altitude and the temperature of the above - the - loop coronal source increased toward lower altitude in the event studied here and another homologous event , sui et al . concluded that the magnetic reconnection occurred between the flare loop and the above - the - loop coronal source .",
    "now we estimate the true jet speed based on figure  [ ang ] .",
    "if we assume the outflow is radial from the active region , then it would be at @xmath080@xmath6 relative to the line - of - sight .",
    "if we fit the inner side of the trace compact flare loops by a circular arc in a 3-dimensional geometry @xcite and assume that the outflow is in the direction of the line linking the midpoint of the two loop feet and the loop apex , the angle is @xmath070@xmath6 . thus , the maximum blue shift of 600 km  s@xmath2 gives an outflow velocity as high as 1800@xmath13500  km  s@xmath2 taking into account the projection effect .",
    "since the reconnection outflows had a velocity close to the alfvn speed [ @xmath7 km  s@xmath2 ] ( where @xmath9 is the magnetic field and @xmath10 is the electron density ) , we can estimate the magnetic field strength near the reconnecting region .",
    "given @xmath11 @xmath12 as the average active region coronal density at a height of @xmath040 mm ( sumer slit height ) @xcite , with @xmath13 of 1800@xmath13500 km  s@xmath2 , we get @xmath1419@xmath137 gauss , which agrees well with the mean magnetic field strength of coronal loops at similar heights measured from observations of coronal loop oscillations @xcite",
    ". the measurements of outflow speed and magnetic field strength near the reconnection region are essential for our understanding of the plasma heating and particle acceleration in flares .",
    "high temperature flows of @xmath01000 km  s@xmath2 have been observed with sumer in a couple of other flares @xcite .",
    "however , since observations of those events provide no information of the location of the reconnection region , it is difficult to pinpoint the origin of these flows , or directly relate these flows to the energy release region .",
    "for example , @xcite observed blue shifts of 800@xmath11000 km  s@xmath2 in the fe  xxi line from the boundary along the tail of dark downflows .",
    "the physical nature of dark downflows is not fully understood .",
    "@xcite interpreted the dark downflows as signatures of reconnection outflows , though the speeds are slower than typically expected and high doppler shifts at the tail boundary are hardly explained in their picture .",
    "@xcite suggested another way that these shifts may be due to a fast wind generated behind the downflows .",
    "the combined observations of sumer , rhessi , and trace of a very well observed event studied in this paper allow us to determine unambiguously the spatial relationship between the high doppler - shift flows and the reconnection region , and thus provide direct evidence of high - speed magnetic reconnection outflows in the current sheet in the corona .",
    "the observations lend strong support to the magnetic reconnection theory and the bipolar reconnection model of solar eruptive events . to better understand magnetic reconnection on the sun",
    ", it requires a further analysis based on 3d models which have shown many different properties from the 2d cshkp model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
