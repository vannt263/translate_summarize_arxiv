    "cro@xmath0 provides a rare example of metallic ferromagnetism in stoichiometric oxides .",
    "it is widely used in magnetic recording and still considered as one of the best particulate ever invented for these purposes @xcite . besides magnetorecording , chromium dioxide has attracted a considerable interest due to its half - metallic ( hm ) electronic structure , which was predicted by first - principles calculations @xcite . the hm electronic structure is such that the majority - spin electrons are metallic , whereas the minority - spin electrons are semiconducting @xcite . in cro@xmath0 ,",
    "such behavior has been supported by point - contact andreev reflection measurements @xcite . because of its implication in various spin - dependent transport phenomena @xcite , the half - metallicity is the very important property of magnetic substances , which is intensively studied today @xcite .",
    "these studies typically include both fundamental and practical aspects .",
    "needless to say that ferromagnetism is one of the key properties of cro@xmath0 , which predetermines its popularity and importance in all the applications .",
    "although the curie temperature is not exceptionally high from the view point of practical applications ( about @xmath5 k , meaning that the magnetic properties are significantly deteriorated at room temperature ) @xcite , it is still sufficiently high in order to classify cro@xmath0 as `` robust ferromagnet '' .    because of its popularity , cro@xmath0 is the well studied material , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "there is a fair number of theoretical works , focusing on the analysis of structural , transport , optical , and electronic properties of cro@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "many of them are based on the first - principles electronic structure calculations .",
    "these works clarify many important aspects of the material properties of cro@xmath0 .",
    "however , despite its immanent importance in the field , the problem of interatomic magnetic interactions and stability of the ferromagnetic ( fm ) ground state is cro@xmath0 remains in the shadow .",
    "particularly , why is cro@xmath0 ferromagnetic ?",
    "what are the main microscopic mechanisms yielding the fm ground state in cro@xmath0 ?",
    "from our point of view , these important questions remain largely unanswered and in the present work we will try to fill in this gap .",
    "the ferromagnetism in cro@xmath0 is typically ascribed to the double exchange ( de ) mechanism @xcite , which was originally introduced for magnetoresistive manganites @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is governed by the large intraatomic exchange splitting ( @xmath2 ) between the majority ( @xmath6 ) and minority ( @xmath7 ) spin states , which penalizes the electron hoppings between atoms with opposite directions of spins .",
    "in such situation , the fm state will be the most stable one because any deviation from the collinear fm alignment of spins will increase the kinetic energy of electrons .",
    "the de picture is well justified for large - spin ( @xmath8 ) systems . in manganites ,",
    "where @xmath9 , it can be very useful for semi - quantitative analysis , and , in many cases , provides a valuable insight in understanding the electronic and magnetic properties @xcite .",
    "however , even in this case , the additional effects can play a very important role and substantially modify the canonical de picture @xcite .",
    "for instance , the well - known antiferromagnetic ( afm ) superexchange interaction @xcite , which is also important in manganites , is formally a next - order effect in the @xmath1 expansion for interatomic exchange interactions @xcite . in cro@xmath0 ,",
    "where @xmath10 , the interatomic exchange splitting is not particularly large and the de picture can be even more problematic : namely , besides fm de interactions between the nearest neighbors , one can expect other magnetic interactions ( not necessarily the fm ones ) , which can alter the magnetic ground state @xcite .",
    "another important factor , which is not treated by the de model , is the oxygen states @xcite .",
    "another disputable point is the role of electron correlations beyond the local - spin - density approximation ( lsda ) and whether cro@xmath0 should be regarded as a strongly - correlated material or not . on the one hand , lsda and generalized gradient approximation ( gga )",
    "already provide a reasonable description for the structural , transport , and optical properties of cro@xmath0 with only moderate manifestation of many - body effects @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it was also suggested that electron correlations are essential for understanding results of photoemission , x - ray absorption , optical , and resistivity measurements @xcite .",
    "we are not aware of any investigation of the effect of electron correlations on the behavior of interatomic exchange interactions in cro@xmath0 .",
    "basically , there is only one theoretical work @xcite , which addresses the problem of interatomic exchange interactions in cro@xmath0 on the basis of first - principles gga and lsda@xmath11@xmath12 calculations .",
    "however , both are static techniques and do not treat dynamic correlations",
    ". moreover , the reliability of the lsda@xmath11@xmath12 approach suffers from the use of adjustable parameters and still unresolved problem of how to construct the lsda@xmath11@xmath12 functional in order to avoid the double - counting problem @xcite .",
    "taking into account the above controversy , it is crucially important to treat the electron correlations ( if any ) in the most unambiguous manner . in the present work ,",
    "we will try to pursue this strategy , first , by constructing the realistic model for cro@xmath0 and deriving all the parameters from first - principles calculations and , then , by solving this model within the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) , supplemented with the exact diagonalization ( ed ) method for the quantum impurity problem .",
    "we will show that stability of the hm fm ground state in cro@xmath0 is a highly nontrivial problem .",
    "if one considers only static electron correlations in the frameworks of either unrestricted hartree - fock ( hf ) or static dmft techniques , the fm ground state can be formally obtained already in the minimal model , including only the closest to the fermi level @xmath3 bands .",
    "however , the dynamic correlations tend to destabilize this state .",
    "therefore , in order to explain the experimentally observed ferromagnetism in cro@xmath0 , it is crucially important to consider other magnetic interactions and we argue that these are the direct exchange interactions between wannier functions centered at different cr sites and the polarization of the oxygen @xmath4 band . another static approach ",
    "the so - called optimized effective potential ( oep ) method , treating the correlation interactions in the random - phase approximation , produces a curious but unphysical insulating solution and further suppresses the tendencies towards ferromagnetism .",
    "this again emphasizes the importance of consistent treatment of correlation interactions in cro@xmath0 .",

    "in this section , we briefly remind the reader the main ideas behind the construction of effective low - energy model and present results of such construction for cro@xmath0 .",
    "the methodological details can be found in the review article @xcite .",
    "all calculations have been performed using parameters of experimental rutile structure ( the space group @xmath13 ) @xcite .",
    "the model hamiltonian , @xmath14 is formulated in the basis of wannier orbitals @xmath15 , which are constructed for the magnetically active cr @xmath3 bands near the fermi level , starting from the band structure in the local - density approximation ( lsda ) ( fig .",

[ fig.orbitals ] ) .",

    "it is important that at cr sites all three orbitals belong to different irreducible representations of the point group @xmath39 , meaning that all local quantities , including the crystal field , dmft self - energy , and local green s function , will be diagonal with respect to these orbital indices .",
    "moreover , the diagonal matrix elements will be the same for the cr - sites @xmath33 and @xmath35 .",
    "each lattice point @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) is specified by the position @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) of the cr site in the primitive cell and the lattice translation @xmath44 .",
    "hence , the basis orbital @xmath45@xmath26@xmath44@xmath26@xmath46 is centered in the lattice point @xmath47@xmath11@xmath46 and labeled by the indices @xmath48 and @xmath19 .",
    "the wannier functions were calculated using the projector - operator technique @xcite and orthonormal linear muffin - tin orbitals ( lmto s ) @xcite as the trial wave functions . in physical terms , lmto can be viewed as the localized atomic - like wannier function constructed for the whole region of valence states . therefore , the projector - operator technique allows us to generate well localized wannier functions for the @xmath3 bands , that is guaranteed by the good localization of lmto s themselves .",
    "then , the one - electron part of the model is identified with the matrix elements of lda hamiltonian ( @xmath49 ) in the wannier basis : @xmath50@xmath26@xmath51@xmath26@xmath44@xmath26@xmath52 .",
    "since the wannier basis is complete in the low - energy part of the spectrum , the construction is exact in the sense that the band structure , obtained from @xmath53 , exactly coincides with the one of lda .",
    "the site - diagonal part of @xmath54 $ ] describes the crystal field splitting .",
    "it has the following form ( in mev ) : @xmath55 the matrices of transfer integrals in the bonds @xmath33-@xmath34 and @xmath33-@xmath35 are given by @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively .",
    "other transfer integrals are considerably weaker @xcite .",
    "the obtained values are in reasonable agreement with results of previous calculations @xcite .",
    "one interesting aspect is the large matrix element @xmath58 mev , which is formally of the @xmath59 type ( see fig .  [ fig.orbitals ] ) and , therefore , supposed to be weak @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , such large transfer integrals are possible due to peculiar geometry of the cro@xmath0 lattice and contributions of intermediate o @xmath4 and cr @xmath60 states @xcite . in terms of the wannier functions",
    ", this means that the functions should have a sizable tail spreading to the oxygen and other cr sites @xcite .",
    "thus , already from this fact one can expect appreciable direct exchange interactions , which will be evaluated in sec .",
    "[ sec : oband ] .",
    "another interesting aspect is the large asymmetric contribution @xmath61 mev , caused by the electron transfer via intermediate oxygen atom ( see fig .  [ fig.orbitals]h ) .",
    "the same mechanism is responsible for finite @xmath62 .",
    "however , it is considerably smaller than @xmath63 .    matrix elements of the on - site coulomb interactions can be also obtained in the wannier basis as @xmath64 where the screened interaction @xmath65 is computed in the constrained random - phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite .",
    "since rpa is very time consuming , we apply additional approximations , which were discussed in @xcite .",
    "namely , first we evaluate the screened coulomb and exchange interactions between atomic cr @xmath16 orbitals , using fast and more suitable for these purposes constrained lda technique .",
    "after that , we consider additional channel of screening caused by the @xmath66 transitions in the polarization function of constrained rpa and project this function onto the @xmath16 orbitals . the so obtained parameters of coulomb interactions are well consistent with results of full - scale constrained rpa calculations without additional approximations .",
    "the obtained matrices of the on - site coulomb interactions were fitted in terms of two kanamori parameters @xcite : the parameter of intra - orbital coulomb interaction @xmath67 ev and the exchange interaction @xmath68 ev .",
    "the third kanamori parameter",
    " the so - called inter - orbital coulomb interaction  can be obtained from @xmath69 and @xmath70 as @xmath71 .",
    "solution of the low - energy model , represented by hamiltonian ( [ eqn.manybodyh ] ) , is a complicated numerical and methodological problem . in general , microscopic properties of a periodic magnetically collinear system can be expressed via one - electron green s function @xmath72 , which , in the reciprocal space , can be formally related to the frequency- and momentum - dependent self - energy @xmath73 : @xmath74^{-1 } , \\label{eqn.latticeg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 is the one - electron part of the hamiltonian ( [ eqn.manybodyh ] ) in the reciprocal space and all kind of correlation effects are described by @xmath73 .",
    "the basic approximation , underlying the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) , is that the self - energy is assumed to be independent on @xmath76 : @xmath77 which becomes exact in the limit of infinite dimensions ( or coordination numbers ) @xcite .",
    "the main idea of dmft is to map the initial many - body problem for the crystalline lattice onto the quantum impurity one , surrounded by an effective electronic bath , and find self - consistently the parameters of this bath .",
    "namely , the local ( or site - diagonal ) green function of the crystal is given by @xmath78 it can be further used to obtain the bath green function , @xmath79 , from the dyson equation : @xmath80    then , new @xmath81 is obtained by solving the anderson impurity model .",

    "we adapt the following analytical form of the bath green function ( separately for each @xmath3 orbital @xmath19 ) : @xmath88 and fit it in terms of @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath85 . generally speaking ,",
    "the number of bath states @xmath89 is infinite .",
    "however , in order to handle this problem numerically by means of ed , we discretize the bath and use a finite number of electronic orbitals @xmath90 .",
    "it enables us to numerically diagonalize the impurity hamiltonian ( [ eqn.anderson ] ) and obtain @xmath91 , which is further identified with @xmath81 .",

    "the ed method allows us to find the ground state as well as the low - lying excitations of the quantum impurity model . the standard numerical algorithms to treat the eigenproblem",
    "are based on the matrix - vector multiplication , where the initial vector , matrix and net vector are kept in computer s random - access memory ( ram ) . in order to make our model treatment realistic ,",
    "it is necessary to take total @xmath93 ranging from 15 to 18 .",
    "however , it would lead to the hamiltonian matrix ( [ eqn.anderson ] ) of the dimensionality @xmath94@xmath95@xmath96 , which makes the diagonalization procedure troublesome , even for modern multiprocessor computers .    in this study",
    "we use the newly developed numerical ed scheme , based on the standard arnoldi algorithm implemented in arpack program package @xcite , where the hamiltonian matrix is not stored in the ram , but efficiently recalculated ` on the fly ' at each matrix - vector multiplication step .",
    "it makes the computational time to increase by only 10 - 15% .",
    "however , the amount of necessary ram is decreased by 80 - 90% , giving us the possibility to perform realistic calculations with the large number of effective orbitals @xmath90 .",
    "particularly , using this scheme , we were able to include 4 bath states per each @xmath3 orbital in the framework of dmft .",

    "this tendency is consistent with results of first - principles calculations and can be deduced from the analysis of hybridization between cr @xmath16 and o @xmath4 states @xcite .",
    "therefore , the negative sign of @xmath108 is due to the contributions of the cr sites , which are partly compensated by positive contributions of the oxygen sites .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath108 is larger in the fm state , mainly because @xmath109 and @xmath110 are larger .",
    "thus , the cr - o interaction additionally stabilizes the fm state .",
    "the contribution of the o @xmath4 band to the magnetic energy is positive .",
    "this is because the o @xmath4 band itself does not favor the magnetism and any magnetic polarization of this band will increase the total energy .",

    "the corresponding energy difference between fm and afm states , @xmath112@xmath26@xmath113 , is about @xmath114 mev per one formula unit .",
    "another contribution to the magnetic energy is related to the direct interactions between wannier functions in the @xmath3 bands @xcite , which are centered at different cr sites .",
    "they are not taken into account in the low - energy model , because the latter treats only on - site coulomb and exchange interactions .",
    "nevertheless , these interactions can be evaluated in lsda .",

    "the parameters of effective potential @xmath142 are found numerically , so to minimize the total energy ( [ eqn : etot ] ) .",
    "thus , the oep method provides some alternative possibility for the construction of static potential , which , in addition to the standard coulomb and exchange contribution , includes the effect of correlation interactions and , in this sense , can be regarded as a step beyond the hf approximation .",
    "this aforementioned oep procedure was implemented for the solution of the low - energy model for the @xmath3 band @xcite . here , we assume that the one - electron band structure is half - metallic and all minority - spin states are unoccupied .",

    ", width=453 ]    the reason for such unphysical behavior is that , even when the hf energy @xmath165@xmath11@xmath146@xmath11@xmath147 reaches its minimum , @xmath148 continues to decrease as a function of @xmath166 ( fig .",

    ", width=226 ]    obviously , @xmath148 decreases when the polarization decreases ( note that @xmath169 is the negative - defined matrix in the imaginary frequency ) .",
    "then , there are two competing effects . on the one hand , the additional splitting of orbitals @xmath35 and @xmath170 across the fermi energy is expected to suppress the correlation interactions .",
    "this is rather general property of correlation energy , which follows from the perturbation theory analysis @xcite .",
    "if there were no transfer integrals , connecting the orbitals @xmath35 and @xmath170 , the effect of @xmath166 would be equivalent to the scissors operator and the behavior of @xmath148 would be totally described by the above mentioned mechanism ( which indeed dominates for large @xmath166 ) . nevertheless , the strong hybridization between orbitals @xmath35 and @xmath170 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : t12 ] ) ] may change this canonical behavior .",
    "first , we note that , in order to produce a large contribution to @xmath148 , one should activate the channels involving the large coulomb matrix elements @xmath171 ( where @xmath19 and @xmath21 are @xmath35 or @xmath170 ) .",
    "this can be done only if the polarization matrix has sizable elements of the same @xmath172 type [ see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ecrpa ] ) ] .",
    "such matrix elements are indeed produced by the hybridization effects in the insulating state [ see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : polarization ] ) ] : because of the hybridization , the orbital @xmath170 may have a substantial weight in the occupied part of the spectrum ( so as the orbital @xmath35 in the unoccupied part ) , yielding finite matrix elements @xmath172 .",
    "thus , we believe that the decreasing of @xmath148 in fig .  [ fig.eoep ] is a specific property of cro@xmath0 and related to the strong hybridization between occupied and unoccupied orbitals in the orbitally polarized state .",
    "nevertheless , such a behavior is , of course , unphysical and this example demonstrates again the importance of explicit consideration of dynamic correlations .    in order to conclude this section ,",
    "let us evaluate the consequences of the exaggerated orbital polarization and gap opening on the de interactions .",
    "the kinetic energy ( without the energy of the crystal field splitting ) , obtained in the oep method , is only @xmath173 mev per formula unit and corresponding parameters of de interactions can be estimated as @xmath174 mev and @xmath175 mev .",
    "thus , as expected , the de interactions are strongly underestimated in the oep approach .",
    "we have presented detailed theoretical analysis of interatomic exchange interaction in cro@xmath0 , which was based on realistic low - energy model , derived from the first - principles electronic structure calculations , and have involved various techniques for treating electron correlations in the narrow @xmath3 band , ranging from the static hartree - fock approximation to the dynamical mean - field theory .",
    "such analysis allowed us to elucidate different contributions to the exchange couplings and understand the origin of these contributions on the microscopic level . despite practical importance and broad interest to the hm ferromagnetism in cro@xmath0 , the problem was far from being fully understood .",
    "there are several reasons for it .",
    "first , there is no single microscopic mechanism , which is primarily responsible for the ferromagnetism of cro@xmath0 .",
    "our analysis clearly shows that it is a joint effect of several contributions , of very different origins , and besides conventional double exchange in the @xmath3 band , there are other magnetic interactions , which are equally important in stabilizing the ferromagnetic ground state of cro@xmath0 .",
    "they include direct exchange interactions , the interactions between @xmath3 and magnetically polarized oxygen @xmath4 band , as well as higher order effects in the @xmath1 expansion for the magnetic energy of the @xmath3 band .",
    "second , the description of interatomic exchange interactions in cro@xmath0 may have many traps , because the behavior of these interactions strongly depends on the method in use , which may lead to different conclusions .",
    "particularly , if one sticks to static methods , which totally neglect the effect of correlation interactions on the magnetic properties ( such as unrestricted hf approximation ) , the solution of the problem may look very easy and the robust hm ferromagnetism emerges already in the minimal model , consisting of the @xmath3 bands .",
    "however , this `` easy solution '' appears to be largely incomplete , as it becomes clear after considering the correlation interactions .",
    "moreover , one should be most careful with the use of additional approximations for treating the correlation interactions , because some of these approximations may lead to unphysical results .",
    "for instance , by using the random - phase approximation for the correlation energy and treating this problem in the spirit of the oep method with some _",
    "static _ local potential , one can easily obtain an insulating solution , which suppresses the tendencies towards ferromagnetism .",
    "this curious example also demonstrates the importance of dynamic correlations .",
    "the most reliable technique for dealing with this kind of problem is the dynamical mean - field theory . in the present work ,",
    "we have employed the new realization of this method , which is based on the exact diagonalization solution of the quantum impurity problem , performed ` on - the - fly ' .",
    "the use of this numerically advanced algorithm enabled us not only no to solve the standard dmft equations , but also to study in many details the behavior of interatomic exchange interactions in the frameworks of this method .",
    "our study provides an important insight into the origin of hm ferromagnetism in cro@xmath0 .",
    "it clearly shows that , besides conventional processes , related to the change of the kinetic energy of electrons in the @xmath3 band , the realistic microscopic model for cro@xmath0 should also include the direct exchange interactions and the magnetic polarization of the oxygen @xmath4 band .",
    "finally , we have proposed how the latter two contributions can be evaluated using results of electronic structure calculations in the local - spin - density approximation .",
    "thus , our work provides the firm microscopic basis for understanding the magnetic properties of cro@xmath0  the canonical and technologically important half - metallic ferromagnet .",

    "<S> using realistic low - energy electron models , derived from the first - principles electronic structure calculations , we investigate behavior of interatomic exchange interactions in cro@xmath0 , which is regarded to be one of the canonical half - metalic ( hf ) ferromagnetic . for these purposes we employ the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) , based on the exact diagonalization of the effective anderson impurity hamiltonian , which was further supplemented with the theory of infinitesimal spin rotations for the exchange interactions . in order to elucidate the relative roles played by static and dynamic electron correlations , we compare the obtained results with several static techniques , including the unrestricted hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation , static dmft ( corresponding to the infinite frequency limit for the self - energy ) , and optimized effective potential ( oep ) method for treating the correlation interactions in the random - phase approximation . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate that the origin of the hm ferromagnetism in cro@xmath0 is highly nontrivial . </S>",
    "<S> as far as the interactions in neighboring coordination spheres are concerned , hf and dmft methods produce very similar results , due to the partial cancelation of ferromagnetic ( fm ) double exchange and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) superexchange contributions , which represent two leading terms in the @xmath1 expansion for the exchange interactions ( @xmath2 being the intraatomic exchange splitting between majority- and minority - spin states ) . </S>",
    "<S> both contributions are weaker in the hf approximation due to , respectively , additional orbital polarization of the @xmath3 states and neglect of dynamic correlations . the role of higher - order terms in the @xmath1 expansion is twofold . on the one hand , they give rise to additional fm contributions to the neighboring exchange interactions , which tend to stabilize the fm state . on the other hand , they produce afm long - range interactions , which make the fm state unstable in the dmft calculations for the minimal model , consisting of the @xmath3 bands . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the robust ferromagnetism in the @xmath3 model , which can be easily obtained using static approximations , is fortuitous and this picture is largely revised at the level of more rigorous dmft approach . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the main ingredients , which are missing in the @xmath3 model , are the direct exchange interactions and the magnetic polarization of the oxygen @xmath4 band . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate these contributions in the local - spin - density approximation and argue that they play a very important role in stability of the fm ground state in cro@xmath0 . </S>"
