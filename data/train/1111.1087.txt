    "optical beams whose phase circulates around a singular point -or central core- , changing by @xmath0 times in each closed loop around it ( with @xmath1 being an integer number ) , are called optical vortices .",
    "the integer number @xmath1 is known as the topological charge of the vortex , and its sign defines the direction of the phase circulation .",
    "usually an optical vortex has a doughnut - like shape and diffracts when it propagates in free space . in quantum information",
    "they have an enormous potential for codifying information beyond two levels using their topological charge value  @xcite .",
    "in other fields , such as biophotonics for example , they are useful due to their ability to affect the motion of particles ( microorganisms ) through angular momentum transfer  @xcite .",
    "other scientific and technological applications for optical vortices are found in optical systems communication , spintronics and optical tweezers  @xcite .",
    "these potential applications of optical vortices have sparkled the interest of the scientific community on their basic properties and characteristics .",
    "diffraction is a fundamental phenomenon which leads to beam broadening upon propagation . in a nonlinear medium ,",
    "self - focusing reduces diffraction whereas self - defocusing enhances the beam spreading .",
    "in a situation where the nonlinear self - focusing effects exactly balances diffraction , the beam can propagate as an optical spatial soliton , i.e. a self - trapped optical beam which preserves its shape upon propagation .",
    "recently , spatial optical solitons have become attractive for several technological applications .",
    "they can be defined as self - localized solutions of nonlinear wave equations found in various physical systems  @xcite .",
    "typical equations of this type in optics are the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) for conservative systems , and the complex ginzburg - landau equation ( cgle ) for dissipative ones  @xcite .",
    "the cgle is a master model in which dissipative solitons  @xcite are probably its most interesting solutions . in conservative models , such as the ones described by the nlse or its several variants , exchange of energy with the surroundings",
    "is not allowed .",
    "self - localized solutions for the nonlinear schrdinger equation originate from a balance between nonlinearity ( e.g. , the kerr effect ) and dispersion / diffraction .",
    "in contrast , for dissipative systems the solutions also exchange energy with an external source , making the problem more complex and rich . in this case , an extra balance between gain and loss is required in order to obtain stationary solutions .",
    "in particular , dissipative vortex solitons in continuous media have been found to exist for several values of @xmath1 , and they are stable in wide regions of the parameter space of the cgle  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on dissipative systems governed by the ginzburg - landau equation .",
    "this model appears in many branches of science such as nonlinear optics , bose - einstein condensates , chemical reactions , super - conductivity and many others  @xcite .",
    "nonlinear periodic structures offer alternative ways to control light propagation by modifying its diffraction properties through the modulation of its refractive index .",
    "for instance , photonic crystals are structures of alternating refractive index that provide unprecedented control over light fields propagating through them ; recent works show that lasers with square - lattices photonic crystal cavities posses enhanced functionality and performance when compared to conventional lasers  @xcite .",
    "these systems can be analyzed in the framework of a set of coupled , linear equations which , in solid - state physics is known as the _ tight - binding _ approximation , while in an optics context , it is known as the coupled - mode approach .",
    "stationary solutions obtained in this framework are called discrete solitons . in particular ,",
    "discrete vortex solitons in conservative systems have been reported on several theoretical and experimental works  @xcite , while dissipative discrete solitons have been found , analytically and numerically , in one dimensional waveguide arrays  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we report the finding of a wide region in the parameter space of the discrete cubic - quintic complex ginzburg - landau equation where different discrete vortex solitons coexist .",
    "all the individual solutions we examine in this paper posses simultaneously two topological charges , as those reported in some of our recent works  @xcite .",
    "we have studied their interactions and as a result the formation of bound states .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ mod ]",
    "we introduce the complex cubic - quintic ginzburg - landau model that we will use in this work .",
    "section [ res1 ] describes the new families of solutions we have found , and in section [ bnd ] we show the composite structures obtained when we let them interact as they evolve .",
    "section [ schr ] analyzes the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation case for all the solutions previously mentioned .",
    "finally , section [ con ] summarizes our main results and conclusions .",
    "optical beam propagation in nonlinear , periodical two - dimensional waveguide array can be modeled by the following equation : @xmath2 equation([dgl2 ] ) is the discrete version of the complex cubic - quintic ginzburg - landau ( cqgl ) equation . here",
    ", @xmath3 is the complex field amplitude at the @xmath4 lattice site and @xmath5 denotes its first derivative with respect to the propagation coordinate @xmath6 .",
    "the set @xmath7 defines the array , with @xmath8 and @xmath9 being the number of sites in the horizontal and vertical directions , respectively .",
    "the _ tight binding _ approximation establishes that the field propagating in each waveguide interacts linearly only with nearest - neighbor fields through their evanescent tails .",
    "this interaction is described by the discrete diffraction operator @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a complex parameter .",
    "its real part denotes the strength of the coupling between adjacent sites and its imaginary part denotes the gain or loss originated by this coupling .",
    "the nonlinear higher - order kerr term is represented by @xmath12 while @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the coefficients for cubic gain and quintic losses , respectively .",
    "linear losses are accounted by a negative value of @xmath15 .",
    "in contrast to the conservative discrete nonlinear schr@xmath16dinger ( dnls ) equation , the optical power , defined as @xmath17 is not a conserved quantity in the present model .",
    "nevertheless , for a self - localized solution , the power and its evolution will be the main quantity that we will monitor in order to identify different families of stationary solutions .",
    "we look for stationary solutions of eq.([dgl2 ] ) of the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is real and @xmath20 are complex amplitudes .",
    "we are interested in solutions localized in space whose phase changes azimuthally by an integer number ( @xmath1 ) of @xmath21 along a discrete closed - circuit .",
    "in such a case , the self - localized solution is called a discrete vortex soliton  @xcite with vorticity @xmath1 . by inserting the previous _ ansatz _ into eq .",
    "( [ dgl2 ] ) we obtain the following set of @xmath22 algebraic coupled complex equations : @xmath23 we solve eq.([adgl2 ] ) by using a multi - dimensional newton - raphson iterative algorithm .",
    "the method requires an initial guess , and it converges rapidly when using a highly - localized profile [ more details can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ] .",
    "small perturbations around the stationary solution can grow exponentially , leading to the destruction of the vortex soliton .",
    "a stability analysis provides us with the means for establishing which solutions are linearly stable .",
    "let us introduce a small perturbation @xmath24 , to the localized stationary solution @xmath25e^{i\\lambda z},\\hspace{1cm}\\tilde\\phi_{m , n}\\in\\mathbb{c } \\label{eq : pert},\\ ] ] then , after replacing eq.([eq : pert ] ) into eq.([dgl2 ] ) and then linearizing with respect to @xmath24 , we obtain : @xmath26\\tilde\\phi_{m , n}+\\\\ & [ ( 1-\\varepsilon)\\phi_{m , n}^{2}+2(\\nu-\\mu)|\\phi_{m , n}|^{2}\\phi_{m , n}^{2}]\\tilde\\phi^{*}_{m , n}=0.\\ \\label{dgl2p}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the solutions of the above homogeneous linear system can be written as @xmath27}+c^{2}_{m , n}\\exp{[\\gamma_{m , n}^ { * } z ] } \\label{solpert},\\ ] ] where @xmath28 are integration constants and @xmath29 is the discrete spectrum of the @xmath30 associated with ( [ dgl2p ] ) .",
    "the solutions are unstable if at least one eigenvalue has a positive real part , that is , if @xmath31 .",
    "as stated above , the nonlinear gain in the system is mainly controlled by @xmath32 ; this parameter will be the only one that we will change in our simulations .",
    "once we find a stationary solution - for a fixed set of parameters - , we compute its linear stability , and then change the parameters slightly and find the new solution using the previous one as an _ ansatz_. in this manner we obtain all the solution families displayed in the @xmath33 vs @xmath32 diagram shown in fig.([fig1 ] ) .",
    "the first of them ( * a*-family ) , was already reported in our recent works  @xcite .",
    "it was obtained by starting from the fundamental four - peaks discrete vortex soliton with @xmath34 , after passing throughout several saddle - node points . a striking property of all the solutions shown in fig.([fig1 ] )",
    "is that they have - simultaneously - two topological charges ; i.e. , they are two - charge vortices .",
    "representative amplitude and phase profiles for these families are shown in fig.([fig2 ] ) .     versus @xmath32 diagram for several vortex",
    "interconnected soliton families .",
    "solid lines correspond to stable families while dashed lines to unstable ones .",
    "( cqgl equation parameters : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) . ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     . [ fig10 ]",
    "[ fig10](a ) and ( b ) show the amplitude and phase profiles for this composite solution .",
    "we observe a spatial amplitude distribution similar to the initial condition , where the four initial cores preserve their initial position and vorticity .",
    "in addition , an extra phase core appears at the lattice center ( @xmath39 ) , around which a @xmath40 topological charge can be observed . if we follow a new contour that encloses all the sites with large amplitude , the topological charge measured will be @xmath41 .",
    "most of the present experiments with optical beams are performed under conditions that closely meet the cubic conservative limit .",
    "so , we are interested in knowing if all these previous dissipative structures can be observed also here . in this scenario ,",
    "all the dissipative parameters are suppressed , i.e. , @xmath42 , and model ( [ adgl2 ] ) reduces to the discrete nlse equation @xmath43 taking as an _ ansatz _ for the decoupled limit for some of the solutions previously described , we have obtained the same kind of structures for the discrete nlse .",
    "we have constructed the corresponding families and also computed their corresponding stability region .",
    "we note that all these solutions exist in the schrdinger limit , but are stable only for high values of their optical power content .    in fig.([fig11 ] ) we show five families of stationary solutions of the nlse that correspond with some of the solutions reported in the previous sections .",
    "namely , the blue line is the family corresponding with the solution displayed in fig.([fig3]a - b ) , the black line with the fig.([fig7]e - d ) , and the red , green and gray line with fig.([fig9]a - b ) , fig.([fig9]c - d ) and fig.([fig9]e - f ) respectively .",
    "the stable ( unstable ) solutions are represented by continuous ( dashed ) lines .     versus @xmath19 diagram displaying the families corresponding with some of dissipative solutions reported previously , but for the conservative cubic case . ]",
    "the inset located in the upper left corner at fig.([fig11 ] ) shows a magnified view of the region close to the linear band ( gray zone ) . as usual  @xcite",
    ", each one of these families tends to increase its power steeply after passing through the point of minimum optical power .",
    "the other inset at the lower right corner shows a zoom of the black and blue curves , which are almost indistinguishable because they have very similar spatial profiles .",
    "we have reported several new families of discrete vortex solitons , characterized for having two topological charges simultaneously , and coexisting for the same set of parameters . by superposing two or more of these vortices ,",
    "we have been able to produce new , dynamically stable composite vortex solitons that are also endowed with multiple vorticity charges .",
    "additionally , we have shown that these composite structures persist in the conservative limit and they are stable for high values of their power content .",
