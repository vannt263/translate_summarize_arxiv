    "since onsager s solution @xcite in the transfer matrix approach @xcite of the two - dimensional ising model @xcite with vanishing magnetic field and its subsequent simplification by kaufman @xcite , there have been a number of related as well as alternative solutions , see e.g.  baxter s book on exactly solved models in statistical mechanics @xcite and references therein . among the transfer matrix solutions",
    "are the ones by schultz , mattis and lieb , by thompson , by baxter and by stephen and mittag @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the author of this work feels that there is still room for a nice and straightforward solution .",
    "a much abbreviated version of this work , sketching only the new aspects may be found in @xcite , while here we give a self - contained account of our approach with all relevant details .",
    "we study the two - dimensional ising model with zero magnetic field on a square lattice with @xmath2 rows and @xmath3 columns subject to toroidal boundary conditions .",
    "the transfer matrix is expressed in terms of the generators of two commuting representations of the complex rotation group so@xmath1 .",
    "these representations naturally arise from projected bilinears of @xmath4 spin matrices . conservatively speaking , we reduce kaufman s approach to its essential steps , avoiding in particular the doubling of the number of eigenvalues of the transfer matrix and subsequent rather involved arguments for the choice of the correct ones . we also need not investigate the transformation properties of the spin matrices . in our opinion , the value of this work is not that it gives the most concise solution , but that it provides a clear line of arguments and requires only rather basic tools from mathematics and mathematical physics .",
    "we proceed in a step - by - step fashion , exhibiting also those steps that closely parallel the corresponding steps in kaufman s treatment @xcite or huang s corresponding textbook write up @xcite . on the one hand",
    "this is necessary because of our slightly different ( but , in our opinion , more natural ) conventions , in particular for @xmath5 . on the other hand",
    ", we would like to keep this work as self - contained as possible .    finally , this work may help sharpen the view on the difficulties encountered when attempting to solve the two - dimensional model with magnetic field or the three - dimensional model and might be useful for simplifying other problems in statistical mechanics for which an exact solution is attempted .",
    "our notation is in the spirit of @xcite , with sans serif capitals reserved for @xmath4 matrices .",
    "the structure of this work is as follows : in section [ def ] the model and its transfer matrix @xmath6 are defined . in section [ xyz ]",
    "we express the transfer matrix in terms of @xmath4 spin matrices @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "a rescaled transfer matrix @xmath10 is defined whose eigenvalues are , up to a trivial factor , the eigenvalues of @xmath6 . in section [ gammaandj ] , we define further spin matrices @xmath11 and two commuting projection classes @xmath12 and @xmath13 of their bilinears . after investigating the relevant properties of the @xmath14 , we express @xmath10 in terms of them . in section [ vpmdiag ] ,",
    "we introduce @xmath15 matrices @xmath16 whose algebra is identical to that of @xmath14 and define matrices @xmath17 in terms of the @xmath16 such that the relation between @xmath17 and @xmath16 is closely related to that between @xmath10 and @xmath14 .",

    "our treatment closely parallels that of kaufman @xcite as written up by huang @xcite .",

    "<S> the partition function of the two - dimensional ising model with zero magnetic field on a square lattice with @xmath0 sites wrapped on a torus is computed within the transfer matrix formalism in an explicit step - by - step approach inspired by kaufman s work . however , working with two commuting representations of the complex rotation group so@xmath1 helps us avoid a number of unnecessary complications . </S>",
    "<S> we find all eigenvalues of the transfer matrix and therefore the partition function in a straightforward way . </S>"
