    "whatever the nature of the donor , it must be able to contribute enough mass to the  to allow it to transition from its starting mass to @xmath3    in single - degenerate binaries , the rate of mass transfer to a  from a non - degenerate donor must be high enough that matter can be burned in either a quasisteady way or else during recurrent novae , thereby eliminating opportunities for more explosive nuclear burning that can reduce the mass of the  ( iben 1982 ; nomoto 1982 ; fujimoto 1982 ) .",
    "that is , the s that reach @xmath0 must process accreting material ; they are nuclear - burning s ( nbwds ) for long intervals .",
    "they are therefore potentially detectable as hot , luminous supersoft x - ray sources ( ssss ) during the crucial epoch when the s mass is increasing and @xmath4 nbwds with mass near @xmath0 have surface temperatures and luminosities at the top end of these ranges .",

    "nevertheless , the companion paper (  2010 ; see also  et al .",
    "2010 and  2007 ) shows conclusively that the majority of the progenitors do not appear as bright ssss during intervals long enough ( @xmath5  yrs ) to allow quasisteady burning of the necessary amounts of accreting matter . for both spiral and elliptical galaxies ,",
    "the discrepancy is at least an order of magnitude , perhaps as much as two orders of magnitude .",

    "these restrictions may be tightened as additional exposures with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ are taken and more data are analyzed .",
    "the most obvious interpretation of the mismatch is that it rules out single - degenerate models .",
    "in fact , a weaker measure of the mismatch was recently derived for six early - type populations , and was used to argue that single degenerates can produce no more than @xmath6 of the 1e  in early - type galaxies ( gilfanov & bogdn 2010 ) . if single - degenerates are ruled out , then the alternative would appear to be double - degenerate models in which two carbon - oxygen ( c - o ) s execute a close orbit . in order for the s to come to interact in a hubble time , they must have had an opportunity to spiral toward each other in a common envelope .",

    "2 we find that , immediately before the common envelope phase that produces a close double - degenerate , an epoch of nuclear burning on an accreting white dwarf is expected . in ",
    "3 we predict the numbers of nbwds required if the -d  channel is the main route to 1e .",

    "4 we discuss the significance and implications of the mismatch .",
    "section 5 focuses on the symbiotic nature of pre - double - degenerate binaries , and discusses the prospects for using the distinctive symbiotic phase to test double - degenerate models for snia s. our conclusions are presented in  6 .",
    "the bottom line is that , for neither young nor old populations can the absence of ssss be interpreted as evidence for the absence of nbwds .",
    "if the photospheres of nbwds are large , soft x - rays may not be emitted .",
    "in fact photospheric adjustments in known ssss seem to occur ( see .",
    "e.g. , greiner &  2002 ) .",
    "in addition , local mass associated with the system , such as winds , can absorb radiation from the .",
    "in fact , the very binaries most likely to produce 1e must eject significant winds if they are to survive (  et al . 1997 ;  & nelson 1996 ;  1996 ) .",
    "in order for two white dwarfs to come close enough to each other to either exchange mass or merge in a hubble time , they must be separated by a distance no larger than a few @xmath7 .",
    "this requires a prior common envelope phase , initiated when a giant with a well - formed core fills its roche lobe , typically at a point when it is more massive than its wd companion .",
    "below we consider binaries about to enter a common envelope phase and emerge as double - degenerates with total mass greater than the chandrasekhar mass . even before describing the calculations , however , we can explain why , prior to the common envelope , the white dwarf is likely to burn some of the matter impinging on it .",
    "this is because the rate of mass infall , @xmath8 produced by winds from a giant , is comparable to what is needed for quasisteady nuclear burning .",
    "most of the mass lost by a giant is ejected at rates , @xmath9 ranging from @xmath10  yr@xmath11 to @xmath12  yr@xmath11 . in cases in which the giant eventually fills its roche lobe ,",
    "the fraction @xmath13 of the winds that impinge upon the  will start at just a few percent , and reach roughly @xmath14 just before the giant fills its roche lobe .",
    "thus , the infall rate is likely to be in the approximate range @xmath15  yr@xmath16  yr@xmath17 these values are near or above the rate required for quasisteady nuclear burning , shown as the black curves in figure 1 . for infall rates between the two curves , matter can be burned more - or - less as it accretes . for infall rates just below the steady burning regime , matter can accumulate over decades and burn during recurrent novae .",
    "the explosions are weak enough that much of the accreted matter can be retained .",
    "for lower values of the infall rate , classical novae that blow away most or all of the accumulated matter are expected . for infall rates above the steady burning regime , not all of the incoming mass can be burned .",
    "the excess matter could be ejected and/or accumulate in an envelope around the .",
    "consider a binary in which neither star is massive enough to produce a core - collapse supernova , and in which the star that was initially the most massive , star `` 1 '' , has already evolved .",
    "let @xmath18 represent the mass of the first - formed , @xmath19 represent the total mass of the giant just at the point when it fills its roche lobe , and @xmath20 the mass of its core at the same time .",
    "we consider as potential progenitors of 1e those binaries in which the white dwarfs are c - o s , with @xmath21 we use a uniform distribution to select the value of @xmath18 to lie in the range @xmath22 and then the value of @xmath20 to lie in the range @xmath23 .",
    "the following situation triggers a : when star `` 2 '' fills its roche lobe , the effect of mass transfer is to further shrink the roche lobe , while the star itself is unable to shrink . in order for this to occur ,",
    "@xmath24 typically , @xmath25 the value of @xmath26 for each individual system depends on the amount of mass ejected from the system , the angular momentum carried by ejected mass , and on the mass ratio . keeping the stability criterion in mind , we select the values of @xmath19 from a uniform distribution : @xmath27",
    "the upper limit was chosen to allow for the fact that the initial mass of the secondary , @xmath28 is larger than @xmath19 .",
    "in addition , the initial mass of the primary is larger than @xmath29 we took the upper limit on @xmath30 to be @xmath31 roughly corresponding to the most massive star that becomes a .",
    "prior to filling its roche lobe , star `` 2 '' was emitting a wind .",
    "we have modeled the wind using a reimers - type law , modified so that it satisfies the following conditions .",
    "first , although there may be modest mass loss during the main - sequence and subgiant phase , significant mass loss starts only when the core mass reaches a critical value @xmath32 the reimer s form then ensures that @xmath33 increases with time , more dramatically as the core mass reaches its final value .",
    "the second condition we impose is that , for stars evolving in isolation , the integrated mass lost through winds is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the mass a star of initial mass @xmath36 would produce , were it to evolve in isolation .",
    "the values of @xmath35 and @xmath36 are related to each other through an initial - mass / final - mass relationship : @xmath37 ( see kalirai et al .",
    "2008 ; cataln et al .",
    "2009 ; dobbie et al . 2006 ; williams 2007 ; weideman & koester 1983 . )",
    "we assume that , prior to the point at which the donor filled its roche lobe , the decrease in the giant s mass can be modeled with the analytic form derived by integrating over the mass lost through winds .",
    "when the giant has a companion , a fraction of the mass it loses comes under the gravitational influence of the companion .",
    "the geometry of the binary and of the winds , and the wind speed , determine how much mass can be captured by the companion . when the giant is close enough to its companion that it is about to fill its roche lobe ,",
    "the winds are partially focused .",
    "we use the expression @xmath38 @xmath39 represents the rate of mass infall to the , and @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the instantaneous values of the physical radius and roche lobe radius of star `` 2 '' .    in the top panel of figure  1 , @xmath39 versus @xmath18",
    "is shown for systems in which the giant is about to fill its roche lobe .",
    "green ( red ) points correspond to binaries in which the combined   masses sum to more ( less ) than @xmath3 plotted as black curves are @xmath42 and @xmath43 as a function of the accretor mass .",
    "these are , respectively , the minimum value of @xmath39 for which quasisteady nuclear burning can occur and the maximum value of @xmath39 for which all of the incoming mass can be burned as it accretes .",
    "the striking feature of this plot is that , for many systems , the rate of mass infall at the time of roche - lobe filling is in or near the steady - burning regime .",
    "furthermore , this would be the case under a wide range of assumptions about the infall rate .",
    "that is , many points on this plot would fall within or straddle the steady - burning regime even if a larger or smaller fraction of the giant s winds were captured by the , or even if the winds were emitted by star `` 2 '' at a somewhat higher or lower rate , or even if the values of @xmath42 and @xmath43 were to differ somewhat from those shown in the figure .",
    "it is therefore a robust result that , just before the common envelope phase , mass is infalling on many of the first - formed s at rates compatible with quasi - steady nuclear burning .",
    "we next evolve each binary represented in the top panel of figure  1 backward in time , until the point at which the giant s core mass is @xmath32 to compute the evolution we must model the fraction @xmath44 of infalling mass that can be retained by the .",
    "the value of @xmath44 depends on how the rate of infall compares with the minimum and maximum rates compatible with steady nuclear burning , @xmath42 and @xmath45 for @xmath46 we assume that no mass is retained",
    ". for rates of infall is within @xmath47 of @xmath48 we take @xmath49 in the steady - burning regime we use @xmath50 for @xmath51 we use @xmath52 with this prescription we can compute the initial mass , @xmath53 of the first - formed , and compare it with the mass @xmath54 at the time star `` 2 '' fills its .",
    "the results are shown in the bottom panel of figure  1 .",
    "for the systems in our simulation , more than @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) was gained by @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) of the s in binaries that would eventually go on to become s with @xmath59 the distributions of properties among the binaries in our simulation is unlikely to mirror the distributions found in nature .",
    "nevertheless , our results show that mass gain by the first - formed s in -d  binaries may be common and can often be significant .",
    "this has a potentially important implication for the rate of 1e that could be produced by -d  binaries , since mass gain by the first - formed  can increase the numbers of -d  binaries in which the total  mass exceeds @xmath3    for the work in this paper we focus on the connection between nuclear burning and detectability .",
    "since nuclear burning is common among pre - double degenerates , these binaries must be bright , and are therefore potentially detectable during an extended interval just prior to the . near the surface of",
    "the   nuclear - burning produces temperatures and luminosities characteristic of ssss .",
    "the pre - double - degenerates in which the total  mass will exceed @xmath0 are not the most common pre - double - degenerates .",
    "it is therefore important to also consider those binaries for which the total  mass is smaller than @xmath3 these are shown as the red points in the bottom panel of figure  1 . while these binaries are presumably not good candidates for 1  s , they too can experience long epochs during which nuclear burning and sss - like behavior occur . in these systems , the first - formed s",
    "tend to gain less mass . in our simulation , only @xmath60 gain more than @xmath61 @xmath6 gain more than @xmath62 and @xmath63 gain more than @xmath64 . nevertheless , because more such binaries are expected",
    ", they can comprise a significant component of bright nuclear - burning s that have the potential to be detected as ssss .",
    "we have found that , prior to the common envelope producing the , there is a time interval , @xmath65 during which the values of @xmath39 are compatible with quasisteady nuclear burning and mass retention .",
    "let @xmath66 represent the mass gained during this interval .",
    "@xmath67 the value of @xmath68 represents an average during the epoch when the wd s mass is changing .",
    "we now compute the number of nbwds expected if -d  binaries are the primary class of 1  s. this discussion mirrors that in  2 of  2010 , which computed the number of nbwds expected if single - degenerate binaries are the primary class of 1  s. the rate of sne ia in galaxies is roughly @xmath69 per century per @xmath70 in blue luminosity ( cappellaro et al . 1993 ; turatto et al . 1994 ; dilday et al . 2008 ; graham et al . 2008 ; kuznetsova et al . 2008 ; poznanski et al . 2007 ;",

    "the number , @xmath72 , of pre - double - degenerate 1  s actively accreting , with masses within @xmath73 of the value they will have when contact is established is @xmath74 if s are the principle s of 1e , then we expect that galaxies such as the milky way , m31 , and other large spirals contain thousands of actively accreting nbwds .",
    "note that this counts _ only _ the pre - double - degenerates that could eventually become 1e .",
    "in addition , there are many systems very similar to the supernova s undergoing the same type of evolution , even though the total  mass will be smaller than @xmath0 . the numbers of nbwds in galaxies also includes those in which there will not be a common envelope producing a close -d  .",
    "elliptical galaxies house older stellar populations and may therefore have smaller values of @xmath71 even though their total stellar mass may be larger .",
    "the rates of 1e in early - type galaxies suggest that they should contain @xmath75 as many nbwds associated with pre - double - degenerates that are s of 1e .",
    "there should therefore be at least several hundred nbwds in each elliptical if the -d  channel is the primary route to 1e .",
    "it is worth comparing the results above to the parallel results for s (  2010 ) .",
    "the number of nbwds needed to produce the measured rate of 1e via the -d  channel may be _ larger _ then the number needed for the -d  channel .",
    "the reason is that , even though comparatively little mass may be gained by the s in pre - double - degenerates , the s are less massive and can burn incoming matter when the infall rate is lower .",
    "the interval during which the  can burn incoming material can therefore be longer .",
    "this can produce a larger number of active nuclear burners at one time .",
    "there are other differences as well , which we will discuss below .      because there is a link between nuclear - burning white dwarfs and ssss , it is important to compare the numbers of nbwds needed to produce the total rate of 1e with the numbers of ssss observed .",
    "the advent of _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ made it possible to detect and identify ssss in external galaxies at least as far from us as the virgo cluster .",
    "because extragalactic ssss provide little flux , individual sources may provide fewer than @xmath76 counts with _",
    "chandra_. with _ xmm - newton _ the count rate is higher , but the number of background counts is also higher .",
    "it was therefore important to develop clear and reliable ways to identify ssss in external galaxies .",
    "a small set of nearby galaxies , m31 , m101 , m83 , m51 , m104 , ngc4472 , and ngc4697 served as testbeds for algorithms to identify ssss ( distefano et al .",
    "2003a , 2003b , 2004a , 2004b ) .",
    "when applying and testing our algorithms , we found that , in addition to ssss , whose spectra cuts off at roughly @xmath77  kev , there are comparably bright x - ray sources that are also soft , but which cut - off at somewhat higher energy , roughly @xmath78  kev",
    ". these were dubbed quasisoft sources ( qsss ) .",

    "2004a ; di  stefano et al . 2004b . )",
    "table 1 of  2010 lists the numbers of ssss in ( m101 , m83 , m51 , m104 , ngc4472 , ngc4697 ) .",
    "the numbers of ssss are , respectively , ( 42 , 28 , 15 , 5 , 5 , 4 ) .",
    "m101 , m83 , and m51 are late - type type galaxies .",
    "the dominant stellar populations in the bulge - dominated spiral m104 , and the ellipticals ngc4472 , and ngc4697 are likely to be older . for galaxies of all types ,",
    "the numbers of ssss are roughly two orders of magnitude smaller than the numbers of nbwds required if the double - degenerate channel is the primary route to 1e .",
    "in fact , the true discrepancy may be larger , because not every sss observed in these galaxies is likely to be a pre - double - degenerate 1  .",
    "some of the ssss , for example , have luminosities that are too high to be nbwds .",
    "others are classical nova ( pietsch et al . 2005 ; henze et al . 2009 ) , with accretion rates not in the band expected (  2 ) .",
    "others are engaged in stable mass transfer and will not produce a common envelope .",
    "the true mismatch is therefore likely to be larger than two orders of magnitude .",
    "we might ask if it is possible that the nbwds in the pre - double - degenerate 1  s could exhibit a hard component in addition to the soft radiation associated with nuclear burning .",
    "if so , they might appear as qsss .",
    "the numbers of qsss detected in ( m101 , m83 , m51 , m104 , ngc4472 , ngc4697 ) are , respectively , ( 21 , 26 , 21 , 17 , 22 , 15 ) .",
    "the populations of qsss are far too small to make up the difference .",
    "in fact , the numbers of x - ray sources that are not either sss or qss in these galaxies are , respectively ( 24 , 74 , 56 , 100 , 184 , 72 ) .",
    "thus , there would still be a short fall by an order of magnitude , even if _ all _ of the x - ray sources were pre - double - degenerate 1  s.    the mismatch discovered through the study of the 6 galaxies mentioned above holds as well for m31 , and for all @xmath79 external galaxies observed with _",
    "chandra _ and studied by liu ( 2008 ) .",
    "other investigations of x - ray sources in external galaxies also give results that are consistent with there being a relative;y small number of very soft sources .",
    "see , e.g. , sarazin et al.(2001 ) ; swartz et al.(2002 ) ; pence et al.(2001 ) ; jenkins et al.(2005 ) ; fabbiano et al.(2003 ) .",
    "in assessing the significance of this mismatch , it is important to address the question of whether the extragalactic nbwds in pre -- d  binaries are bright and hot enough to be detected as ssss .",
    "we have already addressed this question for the nbwds in -d  s of 1e ( , 2007 ;  et al . 2009 ;  2010 ) . in -d",
    "models , the s must have mass close to @xmath0 prior to explosion . as they gain the mass needed to bring them to the limit , they will be the brightest and hottest nbwds , with luminosities near the eddington limit and effective values of @xmath80 over @xmath81  ev .",
    "in several nearby galaxies , x - ray observations conducted to date would have been able to provide a complete census of such nbwds with @xmath82 in the range of a few times @xmath83",
    "cm@xmath17 the mismatch is therefore highly significant , and has been known for some time .    the accreting s in pre -- ds will generally not have masses near @xmath3 in general though , we expect that the first  to form will be the more massive of the two s that eventually merge .",
    "its mass must therefore be larger than @xmath85 and is likely to be larger than @xmath86 although they will not be as hot and bright as more massive s , nbwds in this mass range can be detected in external galaxies .",

    ", even with an @xmath82 of a few times @xmath83  @xmath88 .",
    "white dwarfs of @xmath89 would be detected in m31 with @xmath90  @xmath88 .",
    "several m31 fields have been well studied at soft x - ray wavelengths with _",
    "chandra _ , most notably the bulge , which has the highest density of soft sources .",
    "while _ xmm - newton _ may not be able to resolve all of the sources near the nucleus , it has provided the advantage of wide - area coverage . with deep surveys of the body of m31 , _",

    "2004 ) and _ xmm - newton _",
    "( orio 2006 ) show that the number of ssss detectable at any given time is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the number predicted by equation 3 .",
    "in addition , deep observations by _ chandra _ of the face - on galaxy m101 have been taken ( @xmath92 megasecond ) ; the analysis of liu ( 2008 ) finds no evidence of large - enough numbers of ssss or qsss .",
    "finally , although gas in the galactic disk prevents us from detecting many ssss , figure  2 shows that the _ rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) _ would have detected many galactic nbwds with masses of @xmath87 or @xmath89 , if they emit soft x - rays with the expected luminosities and temperatures . excluding regions with high @xmath82 , including star - forming regions and the direction toward the galactic center , nbwds with the temperature and luminosity expected for",

    "these regions are likely to include at least a few percent of the galactic pre - double - degenerates .",
    "if , therefore , the -d  channel is the main route to 1e , we expect that the _ ( rass ) _ would have identified dozens of ssss",
    ". only a handful were identified ( greiner 2000 ) .    to summarize , data from several galaxies , including our own , seem to indicate that the numbers of ssss are too small by at least two orders of magnitude to support the hypothesis that * ( 1 ) *  the double - degenerate channel is the dominant way to produce 1e , and that * ( 2 ) *  the winds incident on the first - formed prior to the  phase cause nuclear burning , and * ( 3 ) *",
    "the nbwds can be detected and identified as ssss .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the limits on the numbers of ssss that could correspond to s in the mass range corresponding to pre - double - degenerates are not as strong as the limits for the near-@xmath0 s expected in the single - degenerate model .",
    "therefore more work is needed to determine the fraction of ssss , as a function of luminosity and temperature , that can be detected in each of several nearby galaxies .",
    "work that parallels the early calculations (  & rappaport 1994 ) is needed .",
    "specifically , the gas distributions of nearby galaxies can be modeled .",
    "the galaxies themselves can then be seeded with ssss , each with a given luminosity and temperature .",
    "the numbers of counts expected from each sss during observations with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ can then be computed to determine whether the source would have been detected and , if so , whether there are enough photons to determine that it is an sss . in this way",
    ", we can determine the fraction of ssss that can be identified in each galaxy as a function of luminosity and temperature .",
    "we can then discover how many sources are obscured by interstellar absorption .",
    "what does the lack of ssss tell us about the s of 1e ? to answer this question we consider in turn each of the possibilities listed above .    *",
    "( 1 ) *  perhaps the double - degenerate channel is _ not _ the dominant way to produce 1e . in other words ,",
    "the lack of ssss is a sign that the nbwds needed for the -d  model simply do not exist .",
    "we note here , however that this conclusion does not follow simply from the fact that there are too few ssss .",
    "in fact , if we combine the result above for s with the result of  2010 for s , and also assume that the lack of ssss is due to the lack of nbwds , then all models of 1e  involving s that accrete and process matter are eliminated .",
    "* ( 2 ) *  perhaps the winds incident on the first - formed prior to the  phase do not cause nuclear burning .",
    "there are two possibilities : ( a ) the winds are not incident at the required rate , or ( b ) the steady - burning regime does not exist .",
    "\\(a ) as figure 1 demonstrates , the rate of wind infall is in or near the steady - burning regime for a wide range of assumptions about winds , the fraction of winds captured , and the exact boundaries of the steady - burning regime .",
    "the only way that the wind infall could not be adequate is if winds for the giant can be deflected by radiation and/or winds from the . in order for this to occur , however , the  must be generating a great deal of energy , perhaps suggesting that nuclear burning must occur .",
    "\\(b ) the existence of the nuclear - burning regime has been questioned ( see e.g. , starrfield et al . 2005 ) .",
    "nevertheless , independent calculations by a number of groups find that quasisteady nuclear burning is possible ; furthermore there is rough agreement on the locations of the upper and lower boundaries of the steady burning regime ( iben 1982 ; nomoto 1982 ; shen & bildsten 2008 ) . on general grounds",
    ", it seems likely that quasisteady nuclear burning should occur over some range of infall conditions , since it should be possible for accretion at high rates to produce conditions similar to those found near the cores of giants .    * ( 3 ) *  perhaps only a small fraction of nbwds _ can _ be detected and identified as ssss .",
    "this seems to be the most likely possibility .",
    "first , circumstellar material can reprocess the ultraviolet and soft - x - ray radiation , producing radiation at longer wavelengths . in symbiotics , the winds from the giant can play this role .",
    "in fact symbiotic nebulae are common ( see , e.g. , kenyon & murdin 2000 ) .",
    "second , the duty cycle of nuclear burning can be low , as it is for recurrent novae . in the next section we consider a range of measurable signatures for pre -- ds , such as orbital period and stellar age .",
    "we have shown that many double - degenerate binaries are descended from binaries in which the first - created  accretes and burns matter from a giant stellar companion .",

    "it is possible that some of the known symbiotics are headed toward double - degenerate futures",
    ". it will be important to identify such systems .",
    "to do so , we must establish whether the giant will come to fill its .",
    "if so , will the relative masses and rates of mass and angular momentum loss be such as to trigger a common envelope ?",
    "finally , will the total  mass exceed the chandrasekhar mass ?    the calculations that produced figure 1 can be used to study the properties of the pre - double - degenerates that are progenitors of 1e .",
    "each point in figure  3 represents such a binary in which the total white dwarf mass is greater than @xmath3 green ( red ) points correspond to systems in which the  gains more than @xmath56 ( less than @xmath55 ) .",
    "extended periods of nuclear - burning may occur in most or all of these systems .",
    "for example , @xmath95  years is required for a  to gain @xmath55 at an average rate of @xmath96  yr@xmath17 systems in which more mass is gained , however , must burn material more quickly and therefore be brighter , and/or must burn material over a longer period of time and therefore be potentially detectable for a longer duration .",
    "the top panel of figure  3 shows that the systems which gain more mass tend to have larger orbital periods : longer than @xmath97  years for s gaining more than @xmath98 although mass can be gained by s in binaries with shorter orbital periods .",
    "the bottom panel shows that the longer orbital periods for systems in which more mass is transferred are associated with the fact that the giant donor in such systems becomes more evolved , achieving a larger core mass and radius before the  is triggered .",
    "interestingly enough , these are the systems in which the two s that eventually merge will have a total mass well over @xmath0 .    also shown in figure  3 is the lifetime , @xmath99 of star `` 2 '' , the star that became the giant donating mass to the .",
    "the value of @xmath100 is roughly equal to the time after the formation of the binary when the nuclear burning activity occurs . from the perspective of detectability",
    ", we find that many progenitors will experience periods of nuclear - burning activity at times earlier than a few times @xmath101 years after formation ; these systems will be found near regions of star formation . in systems that gain the most mass",
    ", star `` 2 '' will generally have finished its epoch of mass transfer by @xmath102   years after formation .",
    "on the other hand , nuclear - burning activity may occur at late times in binaries in which the  gains less mass .",
    "note that the value of @xmath100 is also a measure of the initial mass of the secondary .",
    "those s in which the total  mass will be largest are formed from systems that experience an epoch of nuclear burning before roughly @xmath101  years ; both stars must start with masses larger than a few @xmath103 ; the orbital period just prior to the  can be longer than @xmath104 years .",
    "figure  4 shows the evolution of some individual binaries in our simulation in which the total  mass will exceed @xmath3 we can use this figure to gain additional insight into the possible appearance of the symbiotics that are s of 1e through the -d  channel . in this figure , @xmath105 would correspond to the time at which the  is triggered ; @xmath106 is therefore the time prior to the common envelope .",
    "the bottom panels show @xmath39 versus @xmath107 $ ] .",
    "the black curves correspond to the steady - burning region .",
    "the top panels show the loss of the giant s mass through winds , the growth of its core mass , and the growth of the mass of the accreting .",
    "all of the systems start with such small winds that @xmath39 is in the nova range ; the white dwarf gains no mass during the early stages of mass transfer .",
    "as winds increase , the s enter the range of mass infall rates associated with recurrent novae .",
    "the system on the left stays in this region for @xmath108  years ; the  gains only a small amount of mass .",
    "the system in the middle panels passes through the recurrent nova region in roughly @xmath108  years and then spends a comparable amount of time in the steady - burning regime .",
    "the mass increase of the  is somewhat larger .",
    "in the set of panels on the left , the mass infall rate increases beyond the steady - burning regime , and the system spends significant time in all three mass - gain regions ( recurrent novae ; steady - burning ; and in the region above steady - burning , expected to be associated with heavier winds ) .    during the recurrent nova phase ,",
    "the duty cycle of nuclear burning and of potential detection as an sss is small . for systems like rs oph , it can be on the order of a percent ( see , e.g. nelson et al .",
    "low duty cycle can help to explain the small observed numbers of ssss ; systems like the one shown in the left - most panels have a low probability of being detected in a nuclear - burning state . on the other end of the scale , accretion at very high rates",
    "can mean that the circumstellar region is dense , so that soft x - rays and euv radiation are absorbed and reprocessed .",
    "systems like the one shown in the right - hand panels may not be detectable as ssss .",
    "figure  5 , produced by the same simulation , shows the duration , @xmath109 of nuclear - burning activity versus @xmath99 the time at which the activity starts .",
    "the systems in the top ( bottom ) panels produce s with total  mass greater than ( less than ) @xmath0 . as in figure  4",
    ", we consider separately the regimes ( 1 )  below @xmath48 where recurrent novae are expected ( panels on the left ) , ( 2 )  the steady burning regime ( panels in the middle ) , and ( 3 )  the regime of infall rates greater than @xmath43 ( panels on the right ) . a difference between figure  5 and figure  4 is that each panel in figure  4 shows the evolution of an individual binary , while figure 5 summarizes what happens during the evolutions of all binaries in the simulation . in addition , all binaries that enter the steady - burning regime start in the recurrent novae regime .",
    "thus , each point in the middle panel _ also _ corresponds to a point in the panel to the left of it .",
    "similarly , each point in the `` heavy winds '' panels _ also _ corresponds to a point in the steady - burning panel , and also to a point in the `` recurrent novae '' panel .",
    "figure  5 verifies that , for many systems , the duration of nuclear - burning activity is long , in excess of @xmath110 years .",
    "it shows that systems in which the mass accretion rate is above the steady - burning regime should end their activity within a few times @xmath101 years after they are formed ; this is because the mass of the donor star tends to be large .",
    "this figure also demonstrates that significant nuclear - burning activity is expected from those pre -- ds that can not become 1e , because the total  mass is too low .",
    "white dwarfs in these binaries can become active nuclear burners @xmath111 years after star formation .",
    "we may expect to find them in elliptical galaxies and other old stellar populations .    the common envelope which ends the symbiotic epoch takes a relatively short time , @xmath5  years to dissipate .",
    "the orbital separation at the end of the common envelope phase determines the amount of time required for the s to come close enough to each other for mass transfer and merger to occur .",
    "depending on the efficiency of common envelope ejection in each binary , the interval between the nuclear - burning phase and the supernova could be shorter than @xmath101years , or longer than the hubble time .",
    "we have shown that many pre - double - degenerate binaries pass through an epoch during which the first - formed   accretes and burns matter from a giant companion . if s with total  mass greater than @xmath0 comprise the major component of 1e s , then the numbers of symbiotics with nbwds must be on the order of a thousand in galaxies such as our own .",
    "if the nuclear burning episodes produce sss - like signatures , then we should be able to identify the pre -- d  s of 1e in other galaxies by identifying ssss . in ",
    "4.1 we have sketched the steps needed to determine the numbers of ssss in external galaxies that have the luminosities and temperatures predicted for the pre -- d  s of 1e . already , however",
    ", data from m31 , m101 , more than @xmath112 additional galaxies , and from the milky way strongly indicate that there is a mismatch of @xmath113 orders of magnitude between the predicted numbers of ssss and the numbers we actually detect in other galaxies .",
    "the result holds for young and old stellar populations .",
    "we have already derived an even stronger result for single - degenerate s of 1e (  2007 ;  et al .",
    "2010 ;  2010 ) .",
    "we falsified the hypothesis that the -d  channel in which s accrete and burn enough matter to reach @xmath0 is the primary  channel and that the nbwds appear as ssss would have been detected directly had they been there , so the previously - existing limits apply . ] combining the results for -ds -ds , we find that there are not enough ssss in our own and other galaxies to explain the observed rates of 1e . since the supernovae occur , the implication is that there is a disconnect between either ( 1 )  mass infall at high rates and nuclear burning , or ( 2 )  nuclear - burning and ssss .    *",
    "( 1 ) * if mass infall does nt lead to nuclear burning , this would seem to imply that a change is needed in our understanding of fundamental astrophysics .",
    "an alternative is that when nuclear - burning does occur , enough energy is released to deflect winds , providing a kind of thermostat mechanism .    *",
    "( 2 ) * mass accretion and nuclear burning is not always linked to sss - like behavior .",
    "this is already known to be the case for many systems .",
    "for example the duty cycle of sss - like behavior is low for recurrent novae ; some of these , such as rs ophiuchi are symbiotics ( nelson et al .",
    "2009 and references therein ) .",
    "in addition , absorption is expected because winds from symbiotics can absorb radiation from the .",
    "in fact the nebulae associated with symbiotics illustrate this point ( see , e.g. , kenyon & murdin 2000 ) .    with regard to the question of `` hiding '' the progenitors of 1e",
    ", symbiotics are intriguing for three reasons .",
    "first , of course , is the likelihood that at least some symbiotics are progenitors of 1e . in this paper",
    "we have focused on pre -- ds that may be 1  s. even among single - degenerates , however , there are models in which the  passes through a phase in which a giant donates mass to a  either through winds or through roche - lobe overflow (  1996 ) .",
    "second , symbiotics are examples of very bright systems that have proved difficult to identify .",
    "estimates of the numbers of galactic symbiotics are as high as @xmath114 ( magrini et al .",
    "2003 ) . in spite of these large numbers , and in spite of the fact that symbiotics are , by their very natures highly luminous",
    ", the numbers of known symbiotics had stood in the low hundreds until recently . within the past several years , @xmath115 candidates , now being checked , have been identified ( see corradi et al .",
    "whatever the appearance of the s of 1e , they too must be very bright , at least during episodes of nuclear burning .",
    "they too , appear to be underrepresented , in that too - few candidates have been identified in our galaxy and in other galaxies .",
    "third , whether or not specific symbiotic binaries are 1  s , many contain nbwds .",
    "the low numbers of ssss we find is therefore relevant for understanding the appearance of symbiotics .",
    "* summary : * the key issue identified by the study of galaxy populations of ssss is that there are too few of them to serve as the s of 1e .",
    "this applies to early - type and late - type galaxies .",
    "it applies to -d  and -d  models . to understand the progenitors of 1e",
    ", we must be able to predict the appearance of nbwds and to identify a larger fraction of them in our own and other galaxies .",
