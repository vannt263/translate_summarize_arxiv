    "many of the most popular models of quantum computation are direct quantum generalisations of well known classical constructs .",
    "this includes quantum turing machines , gate arrays and walks .",
    "these models use unitary evolution as the basic mechanism of information processing and only at the end do we make measurements , converting quantum information into classical information in order to read out classical answers . in contrast to unitary evolution ,",
    "measurements are irreversibly destructive , involving much loss of potential information about a quantum state s identity .",
    "thus it is interesting , and at first sight surprising , that we can perform universal quantum computation using only measurements as computational steps @xcite .",
    "these `` measurement based '' models are especially interesting for fundamental issues : they have no evident classical analogues and they offer a new perspective on the role of entanglement in quantum computation",
    ". they may also be interesting for experimental considerations , suggesting a different kind of computer architecture and offering interesting possibilities for further issues such as fault tolerance @xcite .",
    "we will discuss two measurement based models .",
    "firstly we ll consider teleportation quantum computation ( tqc ) .",
    "this is based on the idea of gottesman and chuang @xcite of teleporting quantum gates , and was developed into a computational model by nielsen , leung and others @xcite .",
    "secondly we will consider the so - called `` one way quantum computer '' ( 1wqc ) or `` cluster state computation '' of raussendorf and briegel @xcite .",
    "then we will discuss various possible relationships between these two models and finally consider possible computational benefits of the measurement based formalism as compared to the quantum gate array model .",
    "the following notations will be frequently used .",
    "the pauli operators are @xmath0 @xmath1 will denote addition modulo 2 . the controlled - not gate @xmath2 is defined by @xmath3 the controlled phase gate @xmath4 is defined by @xmath5 in contrast to the @xmath2 gate",
    ", @xmath4 is symmetrical in the two input qubits .",
    "the hadamard operator is @xmath6 and the hadamard basis states are @xmath7 the bell basis states are @xmath8 succinctly we have @xmath9 we will also use the maximally entangled state that combines the hadamard and standard bases in its schmidt form : @xmath10",
    "recall standard teleportation @xcite as depicted in figure 1 and explained in the caption .    now introduce the `` rotated bell basis '' denoted @xmath11 where for any 1-qubit gate @xmath12 : @xmath13 a simple calculation shows that if we perform such a rotated bell measurement ( instead of the standard one in figure 1 ) then the teleported state at 3 is @xmath14 i.e. the gate @xmath12 has been applied to @xmath15 via this teleportation @xcite .",
    "a particularly neat and general way of performing this calculation is the following .",
    "for any dimension @xmath16 consider any maximally entangled state , written in its schmidt form as @xmath17 consider the mathematical projection depicted in figure 2 .",
    "* lemma 1 : * the projection of @xmath18 onto @xmath19 results in the state @xmath20 at qubit 3 .",
    "* proof : * let @xmath21 .",
    "then the projection is @xmath22 next introduce the `` rotated @xmath23 state '' : for any unitary operator @xmath12 in @xmath16 dimensions define @xmath24    * lemma 2 : * the projection of @xmath18 onto @xmath25 results in the state @xmath26 at qubit 3 .",
    "* proof : * for any states @xmath27 , @xmath28 if we write @xmath29 then @xmath30 .",
    "hence lemma 1 with @xmath19 replaced by @xmath25 immediately gives the result.@xmath31    now the basic idea is to regard the 12-projections in lemmas 1 and 2 as being outcomes of a projective measurement applied to qubits 1 and 2 i.e. we wish to choose a set of @xmath32 unitaries @xmath33 such that @xmath34 form an orthonormal basis of the 12 space . for qubits ( @xmath35 )",
    "the set @xmath36 gives standard teleportation and the set @xmath37 gives the rotated bell basis , reproducing our previous procedure of `` gate teleportation '' to construct @xmath14 at qubit 3 .",
    "note that lemmas 1 and 2 apply in general dimension @xmath16 so we can apply 2-qubit gates such as @xmath4 via measurements by teleportation in dimension @xmath38 . for example using @xmath39 and the 16 operators @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 range over the four standard pauli operators , we can check that @xmath43 is an orthonormal set and the output teleported state is @xmath44 for any input 2-qubit state @xmath15 .",
    "this method of applying @xmath4 requires a 16 dimensional bell measurement but with more subtle means we can achieve the result with smaller measurements .",
    "an illustrative example ( taken from @xcite ) is shown in figure 3 .    * remark : * returning to @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ phiu ] ) , a set of @xmath32 operators @xmath46 will have the corresponding set @xmath34 being orthonormal iff @xmath47 i.e. @xmath48 is a so - called unitary operator basis . for general dimension",
    "@xmath16 many such sets exist , each corresponding to a teleportation scheme .",
    "werner @xcite has described a method for constructing a large number of explicit inequivalent examples .",
    "however we can go even further and choose a set of @xmath49 operators @xmath33 such that the set @xmath50 ( for some chosen constants @xmath51 ) form the elements of a ( rank 1 ) positive operator valued measure ( povm ) i.e. we ask that @xmath52 the case of @xmath53 ( with all @xmath54 s then necessarily equal ) reproduces projective measurements as above but for @xmath55 we obtain fully valid teleportation schemes in which the bell measurement is replaced by a povm . even in the qubit case @xmath35",
    "many examples exist and in fact we can have unboundedly large @xmath56 .",
    "( we will not digress here to discuss explicit examples of such constructions.)@xmath31    thus in summary so far , if we have a pool of maximally entangled states we can apply any unitary gate @xmath12 to any ( multi - qubit ) input state @xmath15 by measurements alone .",
    "a significant annoyance ( and see more about this later ) is that we do not get the exact desired result @xmath57 but instead get @xmath58 where @xmath59 is some pauli operation ( on each qubit ) depending on the measurement outcome .",
    "this is the residue of the randomness of quantum measurement outcomes in our computational formalism .",
    "to perform universal computation it suffices to be able to apply gates from any convenient universal set .",
    "we introduce notation for further gates . @xmath60 and",
    "@xmath61 rotations are defined by @xmath62 the following gate will be significant for 1wqc later : @xmath63 any 1-qubit gate @xmath12 ( up to an overall phase ) can be decomposed as ( euler angles ) : @xmath64 and also @xcite as @xmath65 it is known that @xmath4 together with all 1-qubit operations is a universal set so the sets @xmath66 and @xmath67 are also universal .",
    "we wish to perform arbitrary sequences of gates from a universal set by measurements . for simplicity consider 1-qubit gates : to perform @xmath68 we successively teleport the three gates but instead of the desired result we get @xmath69 where @xmath70 are pauli operators depending on the measurement outcomes . to deal with this awkwardness",
    "we introduce a new feature : _ adaptive choices _ of measurements .",
    "let us assume that all 1-qubit operations are @xmath60 or @xmath61 rotations .",
    "the following pauli `` propagation '' relations are easily verified : @xmath71 ( alternatively we could use only @xmath72 s with relations @xmath73 and @xmath74 . ) suppose we want to do @xmath75 .",
    "the first bell measurement with outcomes @xmath76 gives @xmath77 . now commuting @xmath78 to the left through @xmath79 causes @xmath80 to change to @xmath81 .",
    "so if instead of @xmath79 we next applied the measurement for @xmath82 instead , then @xmath83 as wanted . this second measurement with basis adapted to measurement outcome @xmath84 has an outcome @xmath85 say , and the state is now @xmath86",
    ". continuing in this way , adapting measurement bases to earlier measurement results , we get @xmath87 here @xmath15 is generally a state of many qubits and @xmath88 , @xmath89 are pauli operations on the @xmath90 qubit . the indices",
    "@xmath91 , @xmath92 are accumulations ( actually bit sums mod 2 ) of measurement outcomes .",
    "the same idea applies to the 2-qubit gate @xmath4 too where the situation is even better .",
    "we have the propagation relations : @xmath93 ( and similarly for @xmath94 and @xmath95 acting on the second qubit on the lhs s , as @xmath4 is symmetrical ) .",
    "thus we can propagate pauli operators through @xmath4 while keeping @xmath4 the _ same _ i.e. no basis adaption is required !",
    "* remark : * more generally for any 1-qubit @xmath12 we can achieve pauli propagation by @xmath96 where we adapt @xmath12 to change into @xmath97 or @xmath98 .",
    "but the latter operators look very different from @xmath12 and we have ( unnecessarily ) also preserved the actual identity of the pauli operations in this propagation .",
    "the actual relations we used above for @xmath4 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath72 exploit the opportunity of allowing the pauli operations to change while keeping the adapted operation similar to the original one ( e.g. differing only by a sign in the angle ) .",
    "@xmath31    if @xmath12 is the total unitary effect of a gate array on a multi - qubit state @xmath15 then using the above methods we are able to generate a state of the form @xmath101 . in a quantum computation",
    "we finally measure ( some qubits of ) @xmath57 in @xmath89-bases @xmath102 and the presence of the pauli operations @xmath103 cause no problems : @xmath104 has no effect on the measurement outcomes and @xmath105 requires only a simple reinterpretation of the output results  for a single qubit , if @xmath106 then @xmath107 .",
    "hence we simply need to reinterpret measurement outcome @xmath54 ( 0 or 1 ) as @xmath108 where @xmath91 is the corresponding @xmath94 pauli exponent .",
    "we note a rather curious feature here : these `` final '' @xmath95 measurements are _ never adaptive _",
    "( being fixed as @xmath95 measurements ) so they can always be performed _ first _ before any of the other measurements have been implemented !",
    "i.e. the output of the computation can be measured before any of the computation itself has been conducted and the subsequent measurement outcomes simply serve to alter the interpretation of those @xmath95-measurement outcomes !",
    "in our measurement based models , distinct measurements always apply to _ disjoint _ sets of qubits .",
    "hence they all commute as quantum operations and if the measurement basis choices were not adaptive then we could do all the measurements simultaneously , in parallel .",
    "the necessity of adaptive choices arose from the pauli propagation relations , but some operations are special in this regard  the so - called clifford operations on @xmath56-qubits .",
    "let us introduce the pauli group @xmath109 on @xmath56 qubits , defined as the group generated ( under multiplication ) by @xmath56-fold tensor products of @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "for example @xmath112 has elements such as @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 etc .",
    "an @xmath56-qubit unitary operation @xmath116 is defined to be a clifford operation if @xmath117 i.e. @xmath118 i.e. for every pauli operation @xmath119 there is another @xmath120 such that @xmath121 . hence for any clifford operation @xmath116 we can propagate pauli operations across @xmath116 while @xmath116 stays the same i.e. no adaption is needed ( but the pauli operation generally changes ) . for each @xmath56",
    "the clifford operations evidently form a group , called the clifford group .",
    "we have already noted that @xmath4 is a 2-qubit clifford operation . also the hadamard operation has the clifford property since @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "( for any prospective @xmath116 we need only check the propagation of @xmath94 and @xmath95 at each qubit to verify the full clifford property . )",
    "indeed we can give an explicit description of the clifford group on @xmath56 qubits @xcite .",
    "introduce the @xmath124 phase gate : @xmath125 then we have :    * theorem:*@xcite the clifford group on @xmath56 qubits is generated by @xmath95 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath2 acting in all combinations on any of the qubits ( i.e. arbitrary arrays of these gates ) .",
    "@xmath31    hence any array of clifford gates @xmath128 ( @xmath15 of @xmath56 qubits ) may be implemented in tqc in one parallel layer of measurements .",
    "we get a result of the form @xmath129 where @xmath41 are all pauli operations on the qubits .",
    "commuting them all out we get @xmath130 where the indices @xmath131 , @xmath132 depend on the measurement outcomes and the clifford propagation relations .",
    "the collection of maximally entangled states used in all the teleportations can also be manufactured in parallel ( e.g. apply @xmath2 s to many pairs @xmath133 ) so the entire quantum process requires only a _ constant _ amount of quantum parallel time for any @xmath56 , in contrast to the corresponding gate array whose depth generally increases with @xmath56 .",
    "however there is a further subtle point here : in addition to the constant parallel time of the quantum process , the computation of the pauli exponents @xmath131 , @xmath132 requires a further _ classical _ computation , which is actually the bitwise sum of selected measurement outcomes .",
    "hence this classical computation can be done as a parallel computation of _ log _ depth : to sum @xmath134 bits @xmath135 we first sum all pairs @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 in parallel and then pairs of the results etc . at each stage",
    "the number of bits is halved so we require @xmath139 layers to reach the final result . returning to the gate array of clifford operations , it is known that any clifford operation on @xmath56 qubits can be represented as an array of @xmath140 depth i.e. the same as the total quantum plus classical depth of the full measurement based implementation . but",
    "the virtue of the measurement based approach is to take a fully quantum process ( in this case , the clifford gate array of log depth ) and recast it as a quantum process of constant depth plus a classical computation ( of log depth in our case ) i.e. we separate the original process into a quantum and classical part while suitably `` minimising '' the quantum part .",
    "this kind of restructuring is significant in a scenario where quantum and classical computation are regarded as separate ( or even incomparable ) resources ( c.f .",
    "further discussion in section [ complex ] below ) and we can ask interesting questions such as : what is the `` least '' amount of quantum `` assistance '' needed to supplement classical polynomial time computation in order to capture the full power of quantum polynomial time computations ?    * remark : * it is known that arrays of quantum clifford operations can be classically efficiently simulated .",
    "this is the knill - gottesman ( kg ) theorem @xcite which asserts the following : consider any array of clifford gates on @xmath56 qubits , each initialised in state @xmath141 .",
    "let @xmath142 be the probability distribution resulting from measuring ( some of ) the output qubits in the @xmath95 basis .",
    "then there is a classical ( probabilistic ) computational process which runs in time polynomial in @xmath56 , which also has @xmath142 as its output distribution .",
    "furthermore according to @xcite this classical simulation of any clifford array s output can always be performed in log depth . in view of this , one may question the significance of our result above , that any such clifford array can be reproduced as a classical ( log depth ) process _ plus _ a quantum process of constant depth .",
    "however there is an essential difference in the two representations of the clifford array : the kg simulation results in a _",
    "purely classical _ output ( sample of @xmath142 ) whereas our classical - quantum separated simulation results in a _",
    "quantum _ state as output i.e. we are simulating the quantum process itself rather than just the classical output of some measurement results .",
    "indeed our result makes an interesting statement about _ quantum _ properties of clifford arrays , viz . that the essential quantum content can be `` compressed down '' into constant quantum depth , which is not provided by the kg result . @xmath31",
    "we now move on to describe our second measurement based computational model ",
    "the 1wqc of raussendorf and briegel @xcite at first sight it looks rather different from tqc but we will see later that the models are in fact very closely related .    consider a rectangular ( 2 dimensional ) grid of @xmath143 states as shown in figure [ fig3.5 ] .",
    "we apply @xmath4 to each nearest neighbour pair ( in horizontal and vertical directions ) .",
    "these @xmath4 s all commute so for any grid size they can all be applied in parallel , as a process of constant quantum depth .",
    "the resulting state is an entangled state of many qubits , called a _",
    "cluster state_.    we will also use one dimensional cluster states constructed in the same way , but starting from a one dimensional array of @xmath143 states .",
    "the 1wqc is based on the following facts that will be elaborated below .",
    "any quantum gate array can be implemented as a pattern of 1-qubit measurements on a ( suitably large two dimensional ) cluster state .",
    "the only measurements used are in the bases @xmath144 and @xmath145 for some @xmath146 .",
    "@xmath147 corresponds to an @xmath94 basis measurement .",
    "measurement outcomes are always labelled 0 or 1 and they are always uniformly random . as in teleportation , quantum gates are implemented only up to pauli corrections @xmath148 where @xmath149 and @xmath84 depend on the measurement outcomes .",
    "( these pauli corrections are called bi - product operators in the 1wqc literature ) .",
    "hence we ll get the same feature of adaptive measurements that we saw in tqc .",
    "the name `` one - way '' quantum computer arises from the feature that the initial resource of the pure cluster state is irreversibly degraded as the computation proceeds in its layers of measurements .    to illustrate these ingredients we give some explicit examples of measurement patterns for 1-qubit gates ( where 1-dimensional cluster states suffice ) .",
    "our first example is taken from @xcite .",
    "we noted previously that any 1-qubit @xmath12 can be expressed as @xmath150 to apply @xmath12 to @xmath15 by the 1wqc method we start with @xmath15 in a line with four @xmath143 states , as shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "( later we will see how to eliminate explicit use of @xmath15 here , starting with only @xmath143 states ) .",
    "entangle all neighbouring pairs with @xmath4 and subsequently measure qubits 1,2,3 and 4 adaptively in the bases shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "then it may be shown that qubit 5 acquires the state @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is the outcome of the measurement on qubit @xmath153 .",
    "note that the measurement bases are adaptive and in the above pattern the measurements must be performed in numerical sequence .    as a second example",
    "consider the pattern of figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "then qubit 3 acquires the state @xmath154 so we have a process which is very similar to teleportation from 1 to 3 .",
    "the two @xmath94 measurements may be done in parallel but we can also consider this process as a sequence of two identical steps : given a state @xmath15 , adjoin @xmath143 , entangle with @xmath4 and then @xmath94-measure the first qubit , giving an outcome @xmath155 .",
    "qubit 2 is then left in state @xmath156 .",
    "thus the two - step chain of figure [ fig5 ] can be analysed as @xmath157 ( where we have used the pauli propagation relations for @xmath126 ) .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows a single step operation for the general measurement basis @xmath158 .",
    "qubit 2 is then left in state @xmath159 ( with @xmath72 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ wth ] ) ) .",
    "indeed if we are not concerned with issues of parallelisability then any 1-dimensional measurement pattern may be viewed as a sequential application of the process of figure [ fig6 ] applied repeatedly .",
    "this shows that the unitary operation @xmath72 plays a fundamental role in 1wqc .",
    "for example in figure [ fig4 ] we can reorder all operations as follows : ( entangle 12 , measure 1 ) , ( entangle 23 , measure 2 ) , etc .",
    "this is because the 12-entangling operation and first measurement both commute with all subsequent entangling operations and measurements .    in a similar way it is now straightforward to see how gates may be concatenated .",
    "suppose we wish to apply @xmath160 and then @xmath161 to an input qubit @xmath15 .",
    "measurement pattern 1 for @xmath160 has an output qubit ( e.g. qubit 5 in figure [ fig4 ] ) which is the input qubit for the measurement pattern of @xmath161 . but all measurements in pattern 1 commute with all entangling operations of pattern 2 .",
    "hence we can apply all entangling operations ( for both patterns ) first , to get a longer single cluster state and then apply the measurements .",
    "furthermore some measurements in pattern 2 could even be performed _ before _ those in pattern 1 if their basis choice does not depend on pattern 1 outcomes .",
    "finally we can eliminate the input state @xmath15 from the above descriptions , to get a formalism based entirely on a starting state that s a fully standard cluster state ( of slightly longer length ) : since we can implement any 1-qubit @xmath12 we can take our input starting state to be @xmath143 and prefix the desired process with an initial measurement pattern for a unitary operation that takes @xmath143 to @xmath15 .",
    "above we have considered only 1-qubit gates but the formalism may be generalised ( using 2-dimensional cluster grids ) to incorporate 2-qubit gates . for universal computation it suffices to be able to implement just the @xmath4 gate ( in addition to 1-qubit gates ) . an explicit measurement pattern for @xmath4 is shown in figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "it should also be noted that measurement patterns are not unique and subject to various approaches for their invention .",
    "the @xmath4 gate requires use of a 2-dimensional grid whereas 1-qubit gates require only 1-dimensional clusters .",
    "hence measurement patterns for general gate arrays , implemented on a suitably large 2-dimensional cluster , will generally have some extraneous sites not used in the measurement patterns .",
    "z - measurements are used to delete such extraneous sites .    to illustrate the principle consider a cluster state with irregular shape in figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "suppose we wish to use only the linearly arranged sites 1,2,3 i.e. we want to delete site a. consider @xmath162 , a @xmath95 measurement at site a , with outcome @xmath163 .",
    "to see its effect recall that the pattern in figure [ fig8 ] is obtained by applying @xmath4 operations to a set of four @xmath143 states , located at the sites . but",
    "measurement @xmath162 commutes with @xmath164 and @xmath165 so starting with the four @xmath143 states we can first do @xmath166 and then @xmath162 before @xmath164 and @xmath165 . but @xmath167 so after the @xmath162 measurement ( with outcome @xmath163 ) the sites 1,2,3 contain @xmath168 i.e. the effect of the @xmath162 measurement is to have used the hadamard basis state @xmath169 at site 2 instead of the standard @xmath143 ( with no site at a ) and then entangle as usual .",
    "next consider the basic 1wqc single step of figure [ fig6 ] with @xmath170 instead of @xmath143 at site 2 : we start with @xmath171 , apply @xmath4 , then do @xmath158 at qubit 1 for output at qubit 2 .",
    "but this is the same as the following : start with @xmath172 , then ( i ) apply @xmath4 , ( ii ) do @xmath158 on qubit 1 , then ( iii ) perform the unitary operation @xmath173 .",
    "this is identical to the previous process because ( iii ) commutes with ( i ) and ( ii ) so we can change the order to ( iii ) , then ( i ) then ( ii ) and note that @xmath174 .",
    "a similar argument applies to each neighbour of a if there is more than one . in summary",
    ", we see that a @xmath162 measurement ( outcome @xmath163 ) at a site a adds in an extra @xmath175 pauli correction at all neighbouring sites of a , in addition to the usual pauli operations arising from measurement patterns in a standard cluster state that had site a absent from the start .",
    "@xmath95 measurements also have a second role : as in tqc they are applied to a final state of a computation to produce the classical output results .",
    "so just as in tqc we have the curious feature that these `` final '' @xmath95 measurements are always non - adaptive and can be applied first , before any of the computation itself has been implemented !    to briefly summarise the 1wqc model",
    ", we have seen that any quantum gate array can be translated into a pattern of 1-qubit measurements on a suitably large 2-dimensional cluster state .",
    "choices of measurement bases are generally adaptive i.e. possibly depending on previous measurement outcomes .",
    "thus the 1-qubit measurements are organised into layers and the measurements within each layer can be done simultaneously in parallel .",
    "the output qubits ( always measured in the @xmath95 basis ) can always be done in the first layer .",
    "this temporal sequencing `` cuts across '' the temporal sequence of the original gate array ",
    "all gates are generally done `` partially '' in each layer and simultaneously built up as the layers accumulate . just as in tqc , arrays of clifford operations",
    "can always be fully implemented with only _",
    "one _ layer of measurements .",
    "any polynomial sized quantum gate array can be implemented in 1wqc using at most a polynomial number of measurement layers ( c.f .",
    "section [ complex ] later ) . also we have seen that any array of clifford operations can be implemented with just one layer of measurements .",
    "this suggests the following interesting question : which classes of quantum gate arrays can be implemented in 1wqc with constraints on the number of measurement layers e.g. using 2 or 3 or a logarithmic number of layers ?",
    "does the latter include all polynomial time quantum computation ?",
    "although very little is known about such questions , we have the following result of raussendorf and briegel @xcite .",
    "its proof depends on more subtle properties of pauli propagation relations for particular operations .",
    "* theorem : * any gate array using gates from the set @xmath176 or from the set @xmath177 can be implemented with just two measurement layers .",
    "* remark : * neither of these sets is believed to be universal although it is known that @xmath2 with all @xmath178-rotations _ is _ universal @xcite .    * proof of theorem : * we give a proof for @xmath60-rotations .",
    "( the case of @xmath61-rotations is similar ) .",
    "we use the following three ( easily verified ) facts : ( i ) any single @xmath158 measurement ( e.g. as shown in figure [ fig6 ] ) generates only @xmath179 or @xmath94 pauli corrections . they may become @xmath95 s only after propagation through other gates .",
    "( ii ) when pauli operations are commuted across the clifford operation @xmath2 , @xmath94 propagates only to @xmath94 s ( and @xmath95 propagates only to @xmath95 s ) although the pauli operator may spread from one qubit onto two qubits .",
    "( iii ) the @xmath180 gate may be implemented in 1wqc using the measurement pattern shown in figure [ fig14 ] .",
    "now consider any gate array @xmath181 where each @xmath182 is a @xmath2 or an @xmath60-rotation gate",
    ". set up its corresponding measurement pattern ( using figure [ fig14 ] for each @xmath60-rotation gate ) .",
    "@xmath2 is a clifford operation and involves no adaptive measurements . in the first measurement layer",
    "we perform all @xmath2 pattern measurements and all @xmath94 measurements of the @xmath180 gates ( i.e. all qubit 1 measurements in figure [ fig14 ] ) .",

    "next commute all these pauli s out to the left hand end of the gate array .",
    "this commutation leaves all @xmath2 s unchanged ( as @xmath2 is clifford ) but some @xmath60-rotation angles acquire an unwanted minus sign ( c.f .",
    "propagation relations for @xmath60-rotations given previously ) .",
    "thus reset these altered angle signs so that the @xmath183 measurements again give the correct designated gates i.e. make the adaptive choice of bases for the next measurement layer .",
    "finally in the second layer , perform all the @xmath183 measurements .",
    "we again get some further extraneous pauli operations generated . by ( i ) we get only @xmath179 or @xmath94 , but these can be harmlessly commuted out to the left since @xmath94 commutes with @xmath60-rotations and @xmath2 preserves @xmath94 s in its propagation relations ( i.e. no @xmath95 s are generated ) .",
    "@xmath31      we have seen that 1wqc with two - dimensional cluster states is universal for quantum computation .",
    "nielsen and doherty @xcite have shown that any 1wqc process based on only 1-dimensional cluster states can be simulated classically efficiently i.e. in polynomial time in the number of qubits .",
    "thus the universality of any such model would imply that quantum computation is no more powerful than classical computation .",
    "the argument may be paraphrased as follows ( ignoring technical issues of precision of the simulation ) .",
    "consider any state of the form shown in figure [ fig15 ] .",
    "( the standard cluster state is obtained by choosing each @xmath184 to be @xmath185 ) .",
    "consider now any sequence of 1-qubit measurements such that for later measurements , the choice of measurement basis and even the choice of qubit used , may both depend on outcomes of earlier measurements .",
    "then the whole process may be classically simulated in polynomial ( in @xmath56 ) time i.e. the resulting probability distribution of outcomes may be sampled by classical means in polynomial time .",
    "the proof runs as follows . at a general stage",
    "suppose measurements on lines @xmath186 have already been simulated and the chosen sample outcomes are @xmath187 respectively .",
    "even though these measurements may have been chosen adaptively , once the outcomes have been specified ( as @xmath187 ) we can perform the measurements in any order we wish to compute the joint probability @xmath188 of the designated outcome string .",
    "now suppose the next measurement is on line @xmath134 .",
    "to sample its outcome distribution we need to know @xmath189 here @xmath187 have their fixed values and we take @xmath190 separately .",
    "having computed this probability we sample @xmath191 to give a definite value , and continue in the same way for the next measurement on some line , @xmath192 say .    to show that this whole process is efficient , we need only show that @xmath188 can be computed in poly@xmath193 time for any chosen set of values @xmath187 , on any chosen set of lines . without loss of generality suppose these lines are listed in increasing order of occurrence from line 1 at the top .",
    "note that we can regard a measurement on any line , @xmath149 say , as occurring immediately after @xmath194 and before @xmath195 .",
    "let @xmath196 denote the reduced state of any line @xmath197 at the position in between the application of @xmath198 and @xmath199 , and let @xmath200 denote the application of @xmath199 to @xmath201 .",
    "starting at the top we compute @xmath202 as @xmath203 on @xmath133 .",
    "then compute @xmath204 by partial trace , tracing out system 1 from @xmath202 . then compute @xmath205 as @xmath206 on @xmath207 etc . continuing until @xmath208 where the first measurement occurs . at this point",
    "we do not compute @xmath209 as the partial trace above but instead , apply to @xmath208 the projector corresponding to measurement outcome @xmath210 , obtaining a subnormalised state @xmath209 on line @xmath211 .",
    "in fact @xmath212 is the probability of getting outcome @xmath210 in the @xmath149-line measurement .",
    "we continue in this way computing the reduced states of the lines successively ( using the measurement projector at any measured line and partial trace at any unmeasured line ) until we have applied the last ( @xmath213 ) measurement projector .",
    "the trace of this final resulting state is then @xmath188 . at each stage of this calculation",
    "we need to hold the state of at most two lines ( i.e. not @xmath56 lines with its exponentially large description ) and we pass through the ladder @xmath56 times , once for each successive measurement . hence the whole calculation is completed in time polynomial in @xmath56 .",
    "this feature of the calculation is a consequence of the special ladder - like structure of figure [ fig15 ] and it does not apply to general gate arrays .",
    "the two models have several similarities  both are based on measurements as computational steps and both have the awkward feature of supplementing desired gates with unwanted pauli operations .",
    "but there are also some essential differences : tqc uses ( bell ) measurements on 2 or more qubits whereas 1wqc uses only 1-qubit measurements .",
    "1wqc starts with a cluster state having multi - partite entanglement across _ all _ the qubits whereas tqc is based on a state comprising only _ bipartite _ entangled pairs .",
    "the models can be related in several different ways .",
    "we will discuss three of them .",
    "the relationships serve to improve our understanding of 1wqc and its measurement patterns .",
    "for tqc the relation between the measurement and the desired gate is already transparent .    our first way of relating tqc and 1wqc was proposed by aliferis and leung@xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to identify suitable _ pairs _ of consecutive 1-qubit measurements in 1wqc with a bell measurement of a teleportation .",
    "this approach is strongly suggested by patterns such as the one in figure [ fig5 ] . with reference to the basic teleportation scheme in figure [ fig1 ] we note the following .",
    "@xmath2 transforms bell states into product states : @xmath214 ( where the first ket is a @xmath215 state according to the given sign ) .",
    "hence the bell measurement on 12 can be performed by the entangling operation @xmath2 followed by the 1-qubit measurements @xmath216 and @xmath217 .",
    "similarly the @xmath218 state of 23 is @xmath219 which we can alternatively write as @xmath220 ( where subscripts denote the qubit number and we adopt the notation for the asymmetrical @xmath2 operation that the first qubit listed is the control qubit ) .",
    "thus teleportation fully decomposes into entangling operations and 1-qubit measurements as shown in figure [ fig9 ] .",
    "so , in view of figure [ fig9 ] teleportation can be interpreted as : start with @xmath221 , entangle suitably with @xmath2 s , then do @xmath216 and @xmath217 measurements , which is structurally just like the 1wqc paradigm .",
    "but we have a slight mismatch in choice of primitives : tqc uses @xmath2 and @xmath218 states whereas 1wqc is based on @xmath4 and @xmath222 states , so the correspondence involves a sprinkling of hadamard operations to interconvert these ingredients .",
    "extending this idea , we find that other pairs of of measurements in 1wqc ( such as @xmath223 and @xmath224 ) can be interpreted as rotated bell measurements , but only special pairs of such consecutive 1-qubit measurements can be fused together to form bell measurements .",
    "we refer to @xcite for further details that we will not need here . although we are able to reconstruct rotated bell measurements for the 1wqc implementation of a full universal set of gates , this interpretation of 1wqc has the drawback that single 1-qubit measurements individually can not be interpreted in terms of tqc .",
    "our second relationship between tqc and 1wqc , proposed by childs et al.@xcite and jorrand et al.@xcite , is a further development of the ideas in figure [ fig9 ] . as noted in the caption , the two @xmath2 operations commute .",
    "also the @xmath216 measurement commutes with all subsequent operations on 23 .",
    "thus we can change the order of actions to : ( entangle 12 , measure @xmath216 ) , then ( entangle 23 , measure @xmath217 ) , obtaining a sequence of two operations of the same form viz .",
    "( entangle 12 , measure 1 ) to obtain a state at 2 .",
    "as noted in figure [ fig6 ] , it is exactly this kind of operation that drives 1wqc too , so we can regard it as a common fundamental primitive underlying both models ( and sometimes called `` one - bit teleportation '' ) .",
    "a slight awkwardness in figure [ fig9 ] is the lack of uniformity of actions : the @xmath2 s act in opposite orientations ( necessary for commutativity ) and we have a single @xmath126 gate as well . but",
    "this can be easily remedied : instead of the usual bell state based teleportation scheme we consider teleportation with maximally entangled state @xmath225 at 23 and its associated bell measurement on 12 given by the basis @xmath226 then note that @xmath4 maps this basis to @xmath227 so the bell measurement is equivalent to applying @xmath4 and then measuring @xmath216 and @xmath228 . also unlike @xmath2 , @xmath4 is symmetrical so the picture as in figure [ fig9 ] for _ this _ teleportation process is fully uniform .",
    "the two `` one - bit teleportations '' are now identical , in fact corresponding exactly to the process in figure [ fig5 ] , implemented sequentially .      our third and most remarkable connection between tqc and 1wqc , proposed by verstraete and cirac@xcite , is based on the formalism of so - called valence bond solids or matrix product states . in this correspondence",
    "each single 1-qubit measurement of 1wqc will be interpreted in terms of a full single teleportation .",
    "consider a 2-dimensional grid of states @xmath222 as shown in figure [ fig10 ] .",
    "let @xmath229 denote the total state of all the qubits .",
    "at each site in the figure consider the two dimensional subspace spanned by @xmath230 and the associated projector , renaming these two basis states as @xmath231 and @xmath232 : @xmath233 applying @xmath234 to @xmath235 we obtain a state with a single qubit at each site ( and subnormalised because of the projection ) .",
    "* lemma 3 : * the multi - qubit state @xmath236 ( after normalisation ) is precisely the 1wqc cluster state .",
    "* proof : * we first note the fact of figure [ fig11 ] .",
    "now consider a 1-dimensional grid of @xmath237 states as in figure [ fig12 ] .",
    "apply @xmath234 at each node .",
    "each bond is already @xmath238 by definition . by the fact in figure [ fig11 ]",
    "the projections at sites 23 and 45 simply serve to apply @xmath4 between qubits 2 and 5 .",
    "hence the whole projected state is just @xmath4 applied to all connecting pairs in @xmath239 i.e. the 1-dimensional cluster state .",
    "this argument easily generalises to the 2-dimensional geometry of figure [ fig10].@xmath31    next consider using @xmath237 states for tqc via application of rotated versions of the associated basic bell measurement eq .",
    "( [ bellh ] ) . for clarity of the essential idea ,",
    "consider the 1-dimensional case of figure [ fig12 ] .",
    "let us calculate the rotated bell basis corresponding to the 1-qubit gate @xmath240 the basis is given by @xmath241 where @xmath242 and @xmath243 , @xmath244 , @xmath245 , @xmath246 .",
    "a direct calculation gives the first two states as @xmath247 and the remaining two span the orthogonal complement of span@xmath248 at the site .",
    "thus remarkably these first two bell states lie within the 1-qubit subspace determined by the @xmath234-projection .",
    "furthermore this part of the bell measurement corresponds precisely to the measurement basis @xmath249 on the projected site i.e. on the cluster state .",
    "( note that for other more general 1-qubit gates @xmath12 , the corresponding rotated bell basis states do not generally lie in a simple way relative to the @xmath234-projected subspaces . )    stated otherwise , @xmath158 measurements on the cluster state ( which is the basic ingredient of 1wqc , c.f .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] ) can be thought of as teleportations in the tqc formalism , where the teleportations always produce one of the @xmath250 outcomes ( and not @xmath251 )",
    "i.e. teleportations that have been `` cut down '' by the @xmath234 projection . in a similar way",
    "all other 1wqc ingredients ( viz .",
    "@xmath95 measurements and the @xmath4 measurement pattern ) can be seen as descendants under the @xmath234 projection of teleportations on a valence bond grid state @xmath229 .",
    "we omit further details which may be found in @xcite .",
    "the gate array model of quantum computation provides a transparent formalism for the theoretical study of quantum computation and its computational complexity features compared to classical computation .",
    "so why should we bother with further exotic models such as the measurement based models ?",
    "indeed our measurement based models are readily seen to be polynomial time equivalent to the gate array model i.e. each model can simulate the other with only a polynomial ( i.e. modest ) overhead of resources ( number of qubits and computational steps ) . to see this first recall that the standard gate array model ( allowing measurements only at the end and only in the @xmath95 basis ) can be easily generalised to allow measurements along the way with subsequent choices of further gates and measurements being allowed to depend on earlier measurement outcomes .",
    "indeed consider a measurement in a basis @xmath252 on a qubit b applied during the course of a gate array process . to regain the standard gate array paradigm , for each such measurement we adjoin an extra ancillary qubit a ,",
    "initially in state @xmath141 and replace the measurement by the following : apply @xmath253 to b and the apply @xmath2 to qubits ba .",
    "this simulates a coherent representation of the measurement in which qubit a plays the role of a pointer system .",
    "subsequent gates that depend on the measurement outcome are replaced by a corresponding controlled operation , controlled by the state of a ( written in the @xmath95 basis ) . in this way",
    "we purge all intermediate measurements from the body of the array and a measurement of each ancilla in the @xmath95 basis at the end results in a standard gate array process which is equivalent to the given non - standard one .    using",
    "the above technique any 1wqc process is easily converted into an equivalent ( standard ) gate array process .",
    "we first build the required cluster state using an array of @xmath4 gates acting on @xmath254 states and introduce an ancilla a for each 1-qubit 1wqc measurement .",
    "for each @xmath158 measurement we introduce an extra gate @xmath255 which transforms the @xmath158 basis to the standard basis .",
    "the overhead in number of qubits and gates in this simulation is at most linear .",
    "conversely given any gate array ( based say on one of our previously considered universal sets of gates ) we have seen how it can be translated into a measurement pattern on a suitably large cluster state . if @xmath256 is the largest size of the 1wqc measurement pattern for any gate in our universal set then the number of qubits and computational steps increases by at most a factor of @xmath256 i.e. the resource overhead is again linear .",
    "polynomial time equivalence of computational models is important in computational complexity theory because such models have the same class of polynomial time computations .",
    "but polynomial time equivalence does not preserve more subtle structural features of computations , such as parallelisability .",
    "indeed already in the context of classical computation it is well known that the ( one tape ) turing machine model is polynomial time equivalent to the ( classical ) gate array model yet the turing machine model does not even have a natural notion of parallalisability at all , whereas the gate array model does ! ( i.e. doing gates simultaneously in parallel ) .",
    "in contrast to the quantum gate array model , the formalism of measurement based models offers new perspectives for parallelisability issues . we have already noted the fundamental feature that measurements on different subsystems of an entangled state always commute so long as the choice of measurement is not adaptive i.e. not dependent on the outcome of another measurement . we have seen examples of processes which are inherently sequential for gate arrays ( e.g. sequences of clifford gates ) that become parallelisable in the measurement based models .",
    "the measurement based models have a further novel feature : they provide a natural formalism for separating a quantum algorithm into `` classical parts and quantum parts '' .",
    "in contrast , in the gate array model every computational step is viewed as being quantum .",
    "the notion of classical - quantum separation becomes more compelling when we consider say , shor s algorithm in its full totality , including the significant amount of non - trivial classical post - processing of measurement results needed to reach the final answer .",
    "it seems inappropriate to view this post - processing as a quantum process ( albeit one that maintains the computational basis ) !    in measurement",
    "based computation the quantum parts of the algorithm are the quantum measurements done in parallel layers and the interspersed classical parts correspond to the adaptive choices of measurement bases , determined by classical computations on the previous layers measurement outcomes .",
    "we may generalise this formalism in the following way : we allow ( adaptively chosen ) unitary gates as well as measurements within the quantum parts .",
    "we allow quantum layers to have only depth 1 ( so a depth @xmath256 quantum process is regarded as @xmath256 layers with no interspersed classical computations ) whereas classical layers can have any depth i.e. we are less concerned about controlling their structure .    in this formalism",
    "any quantum computation is viewed as a sequence of classical and quantum layers .",
    "the total quantum state is passed from one quantum layer to the next and the quantum actions carried out in the next layer are determined by classical computations on measurement outcomes from previous layers .",
    "any polynomial time quantum computation ( say in the gate array model ) can clearly be implemented with a polynomial number of quantum layers ( and no interspersed classical layers ) but the above formalism suggests a novel structural conjecture :    * conjecture : * any polynomial time quantum algorithm can be implemented with only @xmath140 quantum layers interspersed with polynomial time classical computations .",
    "@xmath31    this conjecture , asserting an exponential reduction in the essential `` quantum content '' of any quantum algorithm , has no analogue in classical complexity theory ( where there is no notion of classical - quantum separation ) . intuitively we are conjecturing that polynomial time classical computation needs relatively little `` quantum assistance '' to achieve the full power of polynomial time quantum computation . although the conjecture remains unproven in general , we note that cleve and watrous @xcite have shown that it holds true for shor s algorithm .",
