[ wrong ] even though both @xmath72 and @xmath73 lie in the same lowest @xmath50-filtration level and are the images under the spectral sequence of the same canonical cycle in the skein khovanov complex @xmath51 , one should use caution when talking about the `` correspondence '' between @xmath1 and @xmath2 . indeed , as was pointed out by john baldwin , it is possible that @xmath74 while @xmath75 .",
