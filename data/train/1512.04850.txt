    "recently , the existence of a diphoton excess of mass around @xmath0 has been reported by both the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite experiments at the lhc .",
    "the signals are still only @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the respective experiments , but if confirmed , this would indicate the long awaited discovery of new physics at the tev scale .",
    "because of the landau - yang theorem  @xcite , a particle decaying into two photons must have either spin  0 , 2 , or higher . assuming spin  0 , it is natural to postulate that the particle is a composite state of some strong dynamics around the tev scale , since it would then not introduce any new hierarchy problem beyond that of the standard model higgs boson , which may have an environmental understanding  @xcite .    in fact , the relevance of strong dynamics is also suggested by the data .",
    "suppose the diphoton resonance is a scalar field @xmath3 of mass @xmath4 , whose couplings to the gluon and photon are induced by the following interaction @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a coupling constant , and @xmath7 is a heavy vector - like fermion of mass @xmath8 charged under the standard model gauge group , @xmath9 .",
    "assuming that @xmath7 is an @xmath10 triplet and has charge @xmath11 , its loop generates @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the qcd and qed gauge couplings , respectively , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the corresponding field strengths .",
    "the production cross section of @xmath3 through gluon fusion times the branching ratio into diphoton is then given by @xmath17 here , we have normalized @xmath8 by its experimental lower bound  @xcite .",
    "( note also that the decay of @xmath3 into @xmath18 must be kinematically forbidden in order not to suppress the diphoton signal , giving @xmath19 . )",
    "we find that to reproduce the observed excess , which requires @xmath20 , the coupling @xmath6 must be rather large .",
    "this suggests the existence of strong dynamics behind the physics generating couplings between the resonance of interest and standard model gauge bosons .    motivated by these considerations , in this paper we present models in which the observed diphoton excess arises from a composite particle of some hidden strong gauge interactions .",
    "we present a scenario in which the particle is a state around the dynamical scale ( a hidden glueball or a hidden eta prime ) as well as a scenario in which it is lighter ( a hidden pion ) .",
    "we see that some of the models have possible tensions with diboson searches at @xmath21 , but others do not .",
    "in particular , we find that the model having the charge assignment consistent with @xmath22 grand unification has a parameter region in which the observed diphoton excess is reproduced without contradicting the other data . in general , the models described here yield multiple resonances in the tev region , which may be observed in the future lhc data .    in the appendix",
    ", we present a general analysis of constraints from the @xmath21 data in the case that the scalar resonance is coupled to the standard model gauge fields only through dimension-5 operators .",
    "consider a hidden gauge group @xmath23 , with the dynamical scale ( the mass scale of generic resonances ) @xmath24 .",
    "for simplicity , we take @xmath23 to be @xmath25 .",
    "we also introduce a vector - like hidden quark @xmath26 of mass @xmath27 , whose charges under @xmath23 and the standard model @xmath10 and @xmath28 are given in table  [ tab : glueball ] . here ,",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 represent left - handed weyl spinors .",
    ".charge assignment of a hidden `` heavy '' quark",
    ". here , @xmath31 , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are left - handed weyl spinors . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      for @xmath32 , the lightest hidden hadron is the hidden glueball @xmath33 , which interacts with the standard model gauge fields as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the @xmath36 adjoint index , and @xmath37 is the @xmath36 gauge coupling . for @xmath38 , the phenomenology is essentially the same as the non - unified model before . for @xmath39 , on the other hand , the production of @xmath33 occurs through that of heavy resonances involving @xmath40 and @xmath41 . ( in order for the lightest heavy resonance to decay into two @xmath33 , we need to break parity by @xmath42 . )",
    "the produced @xmath33 decays mostly into electroweak gauge bosons , with the relative branching ratios @xmath43 where @xmath44 . by choosing @xmath45",
    ", we can explain the observed diphoton excess .      for @xmath46 ,",
    "the low energy spectrum consists of hidden pions with the following standard model quantum numbers : @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 are real scalars while @xmath51 is a complex scalar . in this case",
    ", we can make @xmath50 the lightest hidden pion and identify it with the observed @xmath0 resonance .",
    "the production and decay of this particle are both controlled by the anomaly induced couplings @xmath52 giving the relation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma - ratio ] ) and @xmath53 this leads to @xmath54 yielding a possible tension with the @xmath21 data  @xcite .",
    "another interesting region is the one in which @xmath49 is the lightest , or only , hidden pion .",
    "a simple realization of this scenario occurs if @xmath55 in this case , the spectrum below @xmath24 consists only of @xmath56 of mass @xmath57 where @xmath58 represents the contribution from @xmath36 gauge loop . the only anomaly induced coupling between this particle and the standard model gauge fields is @xmath59 so its production must occur through that of heavy resonances involving @xmath40 and @xmath41 which decay into two or more @xmath49 ( with two @xmath49 from the lightest heavy resonance needing @xmath60 ) .",
    "this , therefore , does not lead to the ( potentially problematic ) relation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma - ratio ] ) .    the probability of producing each of the three isospin components of @xmath49@xmath61 and @xmath62is @xmath63 .",
    "the produced @xmath61 decays into @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 with the branching ratios @xmath67 while @xmath62 into @xmath68 and @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "thus , for each production of the heavy resonance , the probabilities of having @xmath65 and @xmath66 in the final state are @xmath72 where we have assumed that each heavy resonance leads to two @xmath49 .",
    "this implies that the production cross section of heavy resonances of order @xmath73 allows for explaining the diphoton excess .",
    "estimating the production cross section of heavy resonances by that of a heavy vector - like quark of mass @xmath74 , we obtain  @xcite @xmath75 we thus expect that the model yields the observed level of the diphoton excess for @xmath76 indeed , with this choice of @xmath77 , the ratio of the production cross sections at @xmath78 and @xmath79 is @xmath80 which is about a factor of @xmath81 smaller than in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma - ratio ] ) .",
    "together with @xmath82 we find that the upper limit on the @xmath66 mode from the @xmath21 search can be safely evaded .",
    "the limits from other diboson modes , @xmath68 and @xmath69 from @xmath62 and @xmath64 and @xmath65 from @xmath61 , do not constrain the model further .    taking @xmath83",
    "also allows for avoiding bounds  @xcite from possible particles which are stable at collider timescales , e.g.  states analogous to @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pions_unif ] ) .",
    "the mass of the @xmath84 hidden quark is determined by the condition @xmath85 as @xmath86 through eq .",
    "( [ eq : m_varphi ] ) .",
    "we thus find that the model reproduces the observed diphoton excess while being consistent with the other experimental data , with the choice of parameters @xmath87 for @xmath88 .",
    "note that the value of @xmath24 can be somewhat smaller if it is compensated by the correspondingly larger value of @xmath89 to keep @xmath85 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : m_2 ] ) .",
    "in this paper , we have presented models in which the reported diphoton excess of mass around @xmath0 is explained by composite states of hidden strong gauge interactions .",
    "the models are technically natural  i.e",
    ".  do not introduce any new hierarchy problem beyond that of the standard model higgs boson  and are consistent with the other experimental data ( although some of them may have potential tensions with the @xmath21 data ) .",
    "in particular , we have constructed a simple model consistent with @xmath22 grand unification , in which the hidden quarks are in the bifundamental representation of @xmath23 and @xmath22 .",
    "this model is consistent with the data and preserves gauge coupling unification at the level of the standard model ( which is significant ; see discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite , for example ) .",
    "interestingly , some of the parameter regions have the ratio of the hidden quark masses , @xmath90 , which is roughly consistent with the effect of renormalization group evolution between the tev and unification scales .    models presented here require a coincidence of scales between the dynamical scale , @xmath24 , and the masses of hidden quarks , @xmath27 . this can be explained , for example , if the @xmath23 gauge theory is in the strongly coupled conformal window above tev and deviates from it in the infrared due to the effect of the hidden quark masses that originate from a common scale .",
    "the conformal nature of the dynamics may also help alleviating potential cosmological problems associated with stable particles in the @xmath23 sector by enhancing their couplings to the standard model particles .",
    "it is interesting that a simple structure described here  new @xmath23 gauge interactions with vector - like matter charged under both @xmath23 and the standard model gauge groups  explains the observed excess(es ) while still consistent with the other experimental data .",
    "if the theory presented here is true , then the lhc run  2 would see a plethora of new phenomena arising from the new strong gauge interactions .",
    "after this paper was submitted to arxiv , we became aware of the works in ref .",
    "@xcite which discuss similar theories .",
    "these works focus mostly on phenomenology of spin-@xmath91 resonant production of hidden hadron pairs .",

    "and @xmath92 .",
    "the shaded regions are excluded by the searches in the @xmath21 data . ]    in this appendix , we analyze consistency between the diphoton signal at @xmath79 and diboson searches at @xmath21 , assuming general dimension-5 operators coupling a singlet scalar @xmath50 with the standard model gauge fields : @xmath93 ( our analysis applies if we replace @xmath94 with @xmath15 , and similarly for @xmath95 and @xmath96 . )",
    "we assume that the scalar @xmath50 is produced via gluon fusion and decays into standard model gauge bosons .",
    "the constraint on each decay mode at the @xmath21 lhc is given by channel , we assume that the acceptance of the signal is @xmath97 , which is the case for an octet scalar decaying to two gluons . ]",
