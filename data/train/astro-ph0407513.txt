    "it is well known that the distribution of galaxies in the universe is not uniform .",

    "these regions are known as voids .",
    "the first giant void was the so - called botes void found by @xcite .",
    "subsequently , thanks to large redshift surveys , a large amount of these regions were found and analyzed ( e.g. de lapparent et al .",

    "the first simulations of the dark matter distribution ( davis et al .",
    "1985 ) qualitatively showed the existence of large low density regions , but detailed studies of these regions with better resolution are just becoming available ( van de weygaert & van kampen 1993 ; gottlber et al .",
    "2003 ; colberg et al .",
    "2004 using n - body simulations and mathis & white 2002 ; benson et al .",
    "2003 using semi - analytical models ) . aside from the simulations",
    ", there are many analytical works dealing with underdensities in the mass field ( see e.g. sheth & van de weygaert 2004 , and references therein ) that give good descriptions of voids . on the other hand , analytical works that define the voids by observable objects ( i.e. in point distributions ) are not common in the literature ( white 1979 ; otto et al .",
    "1986 ; betancort - rijo 1990 ) .",
    "an important point about voids is the study of their contents . despite the word , voids , of course ,",
    "are not empty .",
    "the first detections of galaxies inside voids were spirals near the border of previously defined voids like the botes ( dey et al . 1990 ; szomoru et al . 1996a and 1996b ) .",
    "however , extrapolating the morphology - density relation ( dressler 1980 ) one might expect a population of dwarf galaxies well inside the voids . even though such galaxies have not been observed yet , they will provide , along with the voids statistics , a strong test for the galaxy formation models ( peebles 2001 ) .",
    "there is some ongoing progress in the studies of galaxy populations in voids , thanks mainly to the contribution of recent large redshift surveys ( see e.g. rojas et al .",
    "2004 ; patiri et al .",
    "2005b ) .",
    "there are strong discussions about what exactly constitute a void and therefore how to define them . in general",
    ", authors define what is a void depending on the studies they are carrying on . in some works , voids are defined as underdensities in a continuous underlying field ( van de weygaert & van kampen 1993 ; aikio & maehoenen 1998 ; friedmann & piran 2001 ; sheth & van de weygaer 2004 ; colberg et al .",
    "in other works , voids are irregular regions delimited by some kind of galaxies , the so - called wall galaxies ( e.g. el - ad & piran 1997 ; hoyle & vogeley 2002 ; benson et al . 2003 ; hoyle & vogeley 2004 ) .",
    "even though , these definitions give a very good idea , for example , about the shape of the galaxy distribution , they do not provide a particularly powerful tool for statistical inference .",
    "for this purpose we need a definition which does not smears the information contained in the actual object distribution .",
    "note that if we filter this distribution in certain scale so as to obtain a continuous field and use it to define voids , or classify the objects not by an intrinsic criteria but by a distribution dependent one ( e.g. wall galaxies ) , information is smeared and the ability to discriminate between models by comparing observations with predictions is diminished .",
    "this effect is similar to what happens in regard to binned data : the best test using binned data is never better and usually worst than the best test using the raw data .",
    "we define voids as maximal non - overlapping spheres empty of objects with mass above a given one . for example",
    ", we could define voids as maximal spheres empty of milky way - size halos , so that even though , the voids are empty of these halos , we can have dwarf halos inside the voids ( see fig.(1 ) ) .",

    "( 1986 ) and gottlber et al .",
    "( 2003 ) also use this kind of definition .",
    "we will focus our work mainly on rare voids ( e.g. the giants ones ) because the mean number of these voids is a very sensitive function of the clustering properties of the objects that define those regions .",
    "this implies that the available statistics on voids along with more general statistics like the counts in cell moments may be used to obtain accurate information about those clustering properties , providing a powerful tool to discriminate between different large scale structure formation models . to this end",
    "the following elements are required : first , a handy framework to compute , for given clustering properties , the mean number of voids defined by certain kind of objects as a function of radius and , second , a precise characterization of the clustering properties which is both easy to use in the framework and physically meaningful .",
    "( filled circles ) .",
    "as it is shown , voids can contain objects with masses smaller than @xmath1 ( open circles ) .",
    "note that we do not show for clarity the smaller object outside the void . ]",
    "the aim of this work is to provide these elements and assess their efficiency .",
    "we will show how they may be used to infer properties of the processes whereby halos become galaxies of certain kind from the statistics of voids defined by galaxies of that kind . to this end",
    "we need to express the void probabilities in terms of the galaxy clustering properties .",
    "this can be done in different ways .",
    "for example , using all galaxy correlation functions to characterize their clustering properties we could , in principle , obtain the corresponding void statistics @xcite .",
    "however , in practice , this procedure is not feasible .",
    "furthermore , even if it were , the information obtained about the clustering properties in this representation do not have a direct connection with galaxy formation processes . in the procedure we present in this work",
    ", we first compute the probabilities of voids defined by halos with masses above a given value .",
    "this can be done analytically by combining statistics with purely gravitational dynamics .",
    "then , we describe the clustering properties of the galaxies by their relative biasing with respect to halos of the same mass , which may be expressed in terms of the conditional luminosity function , and obtain an expression for the mean number of voids defined by galaxies . for this relative biasing we may either use the existing semi - analytic models ( for example , @xcite ) using our formalism in a predictive way , or use this formalism in an inductive way to determine that biasing from the observations .",
    "this will be presented in a formal way in the discussion , leaving its applications for a future work .",
    "the structure of the work is as follows . in section 2",
    "we use an existing framework @xcite that allows us to derive the number density of voids of a given radius from the probability that a randomly placed sphere of that radius be empty of the objects defining the void ( the vpf ) .",
    "we also show in section 2 how this probability may be obtained by means of an expression containing the biasing of halos with respect to mass . in section 3",
    "we present an extension of the unconditional mass function ( umf ) @xcite to constrained environments , which allow us to obtain the conditional mass function ( cmf ) which , in turn , is used to quantify the biasing of halos with respect to mass . in section 4 we show , by combining spherical collapse with the cmf , how to obtain the mean density profile both for the mass and for the halos within and around voids . in section 5",
    "we apply our formalism to different cases to obtain void probabilities and their mass density and halo number density profiles and compare the results with those found in existing numerical simulations .",
    "finally , in section 6 we discuss how to use our formalism to obtain the probabilities of voids defined by galaxies .",
    "the general framework for evaluating the mean number densities ( i.e. probability densities ) of structures like voids @xcite has been applied to the standard large scale structure models ( i.e. gaussian initial density fluctuation growing gravitationally ) .",
    "the framework we use here is essentially an updated and extended version of the one developed by @xcite .",
    "there , the number density , @xmath2 of non - overlapping empty ( of the objects defining the voids ) spheres with radius @xmath3 is given by :    @xmath4    with    @xmath5    and    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the probability that a randomly placed sphere of radius @xmath3 be empty ( this is the so - called void probability function , vpf ) , @xmath8 is the mean number density of the objects defining the void , @xmath9 is the fractional fluctuation of the mean number density of these objects within a sphere of radius @xmath3 as a function of the actual fractional mass density fluctuation within that sphere , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the probability distribution for the values of @xmath10 within a randomly chosen sphere of radius @xmath3 . the bias of halos with respect to mass is contained within @xmath12 ; in the non - biased case ( which corresponds to the low halo mass limit ) we have simply @xmath13 equal to @xmath10",
    ".    equation ( [ eq : eq1 ] ) ( without the last parenthesis ) is valid for rare events , that is , when the mean distance between voids is much larger than the radius , which imply :    @xmath14    in fact , when @xmath15 is larger than about @xmath16 , equation ( [ eq : eq1 ] ) with only the zeroth order term in the last parenthesis is sufficiently accurate . extending eq.([eq : eq1 ] ) to smaller values of @xmath15 ( i.e. obtaining the terms of order @xmath17 ) is straightforward ( but complex ) , however , eq.([eq : eq1 ] ) ( without the last parenthesis ) will be enough to our purposes because the most relevant constraints for galaxy formation models comes from not too common voids ( i.e. @xmath15 sufficiently large ) .    the exponential in eq.([eq : eq2 ] ) represents the probability that a randomly placed sphere of radius @xmath3 be empty of the relevant objects , when the mean fractional density fluctuation within the sphere take the value @xmath10 . multiplying this quantity by the probability for a randomly placed sphere of radius @xmath3 to have an inner mean fluctuation between @xmath10 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and integrating over all possible values of @xmath10 we obtain @xmath7 .",
    "it must be noted that the exponential in eq.([eq : eq2 ] ) gives correctly the probability that the sphere be empty only when the clustering of the relevant objects conforms to a non - uniform random poissonian process ( peebles 1980 ) .",
    "this is the case to a very high accuracy both when the objects are mass particles or halos of a given mass , on scales ( as those of voids ) which are much larger than the size of the halos . for galaxies",
    ", the model might not be so good . in section 6",
    "we show how to modify expression ( [ eq : eq2 ] ) to be valid for objects whose clustering properties conform to any possible interesting model .    for mass particles",
    "@xmath20 , so that eq.([eq : eq2 ] ) is particularly simple . from this expression",
    "it is easy to see that as the density of particles ( @xmath8 ) increases , the size of the voids goes to zero .",
    "the probability distribution , @xmath11 , for a given power spectra is given , for any value of @xmath10 in @xcite . however , since the evolution of large voids is well described by the spherical model , we may use in eq.([eq : eq2 ] ) the spherical approximation to @xmath11 , also given in that reference with an error that for the voids under consideration is not very relevant , although in some cases , when high accuracy is required , the full @xmath11 may be needed .",
    "so , we shall use for @xmath11 :    @xmath21    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the variance of the linear density fluctuation with a top - hat filtering on a scale @xmath3 as a function of @xmath3 ; @xmath24 is the linear value of the density fluctuations which is related to @xmath10 by the spherical model . for @xmath25 and @xmath26",

    "@xmath33    \\label{eq : eq6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this expression for @xmath34 @xcite corresponds to the same cosmological parameters as eq.([eq : eq4 ] ) with @xmath35 and is the inverse function of eq.([eq : eq4 ] ) .",
    "note that we write @xmath36 rather than simply @xmath12 because it is @xmath37 that we may compute directly ( see next section ) , while @xmath12 is obtained through the dependence of @xmath38 on @xmath10 . here",
    "we shall use the first expression ( eq.([eq : eq5 ] ) ) for @xmath7 while the second must be used when the exact @xmath39 , rather than the spherical collapse approximation , is needed .",
    "using eq.([eq : eq5 ] ) ( or eq.([eq : eq6b ] ) ) in eq.([eq : eq1 ] ) we obtain the mean density of non - overlapping empty sphere of radius @xmath3 , @xmath2 .",
    "the number density of voids so that the largest sphere that they can accommodate have radii between @xmath3 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 , is related to @xmath2 by :    @xmath42    @xmath43    where @xmath44 depends on the mean ellipticity of the voids and may be taken equal to @xmath45 without losing much accuracy .",
    "but , in fact , in the interesting cases ( @xmath46 ) , @xmath47 , so we may write :    @xmath48    the mean number , @xmath49 , of voids with radius larger than @xmath3 within the volume of observation @xmath50 is then :    @xmath51",
    "to derive the mean fractional number density fluctuation within a sphere , @xmath13 , as a function of the mean linear fractional density fluctuation within it , @xmath53 , we first obtain the mean fractional fluctuation of the number density of proto - halos within the sphere before the sphere expands in comoving coordinates , @xmath54 , as a function of @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath54 may be called the statistical fluctuation , since it is due to the clustering of the protohalos in the initial conditions before they move with mass . to obtain @xmath55",
    "we need a framework that enables us to obtain the conditional mass function ( cmf ) of collapsed objects @xmath56 at a distance @xmath57 from a point such that the mean density within a sphere of radius @xmath58 ( radius of the void ) centered at this point is @xmath53 ( the linear value ; @xmath59 is the actual one ) . @xmath58 and @xmath57 denote the lagrangian radius ; for eulerian radius ( i.e. present comoving radius ) we use respectively @xmath60 and @xmath3 .",
    "we then have for @xmath54 :    @xmath61   \\label{eq : eq9}\\ ] ]    @xmath62    @xmath63    where @xmath64 is the unconditional number density of collapsed object with mass @xmath65 .",
    "the bracketed expression is the mean value within the sphere of radius @xmath58 of the number density , @xmath66 , of collapsed objects with masses above @xmath65 when the mean linear fractional mass density fluctuation within it is @xmath38 .    as indicated in eq.([eq : eq9 ] ) , @xmath54 depends , in principle , on @xmath65 , @xmath58 and @xmath53 .",
    "however , it may be shown on general grounds ( and we have fully checked ) that @xmath67 , @xmath66 depend on @xmath57 and @xmath58 almost entirely through @xmath68 .",
    "the reason for this lays in on the goodness of the approximation given in expression ( [ eq : eq110 ] ) .",
    "as mentioned bellow this expression , there is a small residual dependence on @xmath58 , but it is completely negligible within the relevant range of @xmath58 values ( less than a factor 2 ) .",
    "then it follows from eq.([eq : eq9 ] ) that @xmath54 is independent of @xmath58 , since , using the change of variable @xmath69 , we may write this equation in the form :    @xmath70   \\label{eq : eq999}\\ ] ]    to obtain the fluctuation in eulerian coordinates , @xmath13 , we only need to note that as the void expands the initial fractional halo number density further diminishes by the factor @xmath71 :    @xmath72    this is the expression that we use in eq.([eq : eq5 ] ) to obtain @xmath7",
    ". the unconditional mass function of collapsed objects .",

    "expression ( [ eq : eq999 ] ) gives the lagrangian constrained accumulated mass function , @xmath84 , averaged within a sphere with mean inner linear underdensity @xmath53 and radius @xmath58 ( whose dependence on @xmath58 has been neglected ) given the local lagrangian accumulated mass function at a distance @xmath57 from the center of that sphere , @xmath85 :    @xmath86    thus , the accumulated eulerian mass function averaged within the sphere , @xmath87 , which is the ordinary mass function , is given by :    @xmath88    these expressions involve an integral within the sphere of the local lagrangian constrained mass function , @xmath83 .",
    "thus , this last function is necessary to obtain both @xmath89 and through expression ( [ eq : eq122 ] ) , @xmath90 .",
    "there are several approaches ( sheth & tormen 2002 ; gottlber et al .",
    "2003 ; golberg et al . 2004 ) giving rough approximations and providing reasonable fitting formula for @xmath89 , however none of them provides directly ( without fitting ) an expression sufficiently accurate to allow us to evaluate the void number densities , which depends very sensitively on @xmath90 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the local mass function changes substantially from the center of the sphere ( @xmath91 ) to its boundary ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "in fact , for any @xmath53 , the mean value of @xmath93 within the sphere is approximately the square root of its value at the center and the value of this quantity at the boundary is almost the cubic root of its value at the center .",
    "so , computing the mass function at the center instead of the mean value , or assuming that the interior of the sphere may be replaced by a homogeneous environment characterized by the mean properties of the actual one do not lead to sufficiently good results .    there have been several attempts to derive analytically the cmf .",
    "arguably , the most motivated one is that combining the excursion set formalism ( appel & jones 1990 ; bond et al .",
    "1991 ) with ellipsoidal dynamics ( sheth & tormen 2002 ) .",
    "however , this procedure is not appropriate to our purposes because , by construction , it gives the cmf at the center of the sphere , which , as we stated before , is quite different from the mean within the sphere , which is the one that we need . in principle",
    ", one could repeat the st derivation at @xmath91 for any value of @xmath57 and average over the sphere as indicated in eq.(9 ) , but this implies a rather complex problem that can not be solved without some approximations .",
    "furthermore , even if the problem could be treated exactly it would provide at most a good fitting formula where some parameters have to be slightly modified ( with respect to those given directly by the formalism ) to match numerical simulations , as , indeed , have already been done for the unconstrained case ( sheth & tormen 2002 ) .    in another approach ( gottlber et al .",
    "2003 ) , the interior of the sphere is treated as a homogeneous environment and the unconditional mass function is rescaled to it .",
    "but , leaving aside some queries about the motivation for this procedure , in fact , it disagrees substantially with the simulations for large masses .    summarizing ,",
    "neither the available cmf s nor any other we can envisage derived from simple considerations can a priori be expected to give results which are sufficiently accurate to our purposes .",
    "fortunately , although we can not directly obtain analytically a satisfactory cmf , we may analytically extend the umf through a procedure which is , in practice , exact .      to obtain the cmf",
    ", we simply note that , as long as the local evolution at a conditioned point is the same as at an unconditioned one , the conditional local mass function of collapsed objects may be derived from the statistical properties of the local linear field in the same way as the unconditional one .    as to the validity of this assumption",
    ", three reasons may be advanced :    * given the large difference between the scale of the constraint ( that of the void ) and the scale corresponding to the masses we consider , the conditional shear distribution ( of the field filtered on the scale of those masses ) can not be very different from the unconditional one * the profile of the linear density field within the void is not too steep .",
    "this means that the mean negative value of the shear in the radial direction imposed by this profile is rather small ( it would be strictly zero for a flat profile ) .",
    "so , the departure of the local shear distribution from the unconditional one is smaller than implied in general by the first consideration * it must be noted that the shear distribution plays a secondary role with respect to the trace ( of the local velocity field tensor ) in determining the mass distribution of collapsed objects .",
    "the difference between st and the ps formalisms is due to the fact that in the former , the shear distribution is taken into account .",
    "the difference between the results of both formalisms is not that large ( less than a factor 2 ) .",
    "so , the small change in the shear distribution within a void which , according to the two previous considerations , is small , should lead to a negligible error for our extended mass function    that is , if the constrained field behaves  locally \" as an isotropic uniform random gaussian field ( with locally defined mean and power spectra ) , or , alternatively , if the shear distribution of the linear velocity field is at a constrained point equal to that at a randomly chosen one , we may obtain the local mass function using the unconstrained mass function ( umf ) for this local field .",
    "the relevant statistical property is the probability distribution , @xmath94 , for the linear density fluctuation , @xmath95 , on scale @xmath96 ( that of the halos considered ) at a distance @xmath57 from the center of a sphere of radius @xmath58 ( the protovoid ) with mean inner linear density fluctuation @xmath38 ( see the conceptual diagram in figure ( [ fig : fig1 ] ) ) .    for a gaussian field",
    "we have :    @xmath97    where    @xmath98    @xmath99",
    "@xmath100    @xmath101    where @xmath102 is the linear power spectrum of density fluctuations . comparing with the distribution of @xmath95 at a randomly chosen point which is the one implicitly involved in the derivation of the unconditional mass function , we find :    @xmath103    we see that , at least for the one point statistics , the field @xmath95 at a constrained point behaves like an unconstrained field but with a mean value proportional to @xmath53 and a modified power spectra .",
    "it may be shown ( rubio et al .",
    "2006 ) that the joint probability distribution for the field @xmath95 at several neighboring points follows very closely a gaussian multivariate with the same mean and power spectra as the one point distribution .",
    "it is then easy to realize that the conditional mass distribution could be obtained through the following substitution in eq.([eq : eq10 ] ) and a renormalization ( see @xcite ) :    @xmath104    @xmath105    @xmath106    @xmath107 , @xmath108 depends on mass through the mass - scale relationship :    @xmath109    @xmath110    @xmath111    after this substitution , we obtain the local lagrangian mass function , @xmath112 , which as we advanced , in practice , is only a function of @xmath68 .",
    "note that this extending procedure is not compromised with any particular fit to the umf .",
    "actually , we could use for example the fit proposed by jenkins et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . for our purposes",
    ", however , expressions ( 12 ) is to be preferred , because it is very accurate in the mass range we are interested in .     from the center of a sphere of radius @xmath58 with mean inner linear underdensity @xmath113 , we consider the probability distribution at @xmath57 for the mean linear underdensity ( @xmath95 ) within a sphere with radius @xmath96 corresponding to the mass under consideration ( see text for details ) . ]",
    "it must be noted that for our expression for the local number density of collapsed objects of mass @xmath65 to be valid this quantity must change little within a distance of the order of the scale corresponding to @xmath65 .",
    "however , since the scale of variation of the density ( for any @xmath65 ) is on the order of the void radius , it is clear that this condition holds provided that @xmath114 .    to carry out the computation we first obtain a fit to @xmath115 and find that it has the form :    @xmath116    where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are certain coefficients almost independent of mass for @xmath119 , and only mildly depending on @xmath58 .",
    "for @xmath58 between @xmath120 and @xmath121 , which include all voids we will consider , @xmath118 goes from 0.481 to 0.554 .",
    "so , we may use the following values for @xmath122 over the whole range :    @xmath123    inserting this in expression [ eq : eq9980 ] and using [ eq : eq999 ] we find for @xmath124 :    @xmath125    @xmath126    which provides a very good fit for @xmath127 . @xmath128 and @xmath129 are coefficients depending only on mass ( for values of q in the relevant range ) .",
    "note that we may need different values of @xmath122 for voids substantially larger than those considered here .",
    "so , the coefficients @xmath130 , @xmath131 will , in general , depend on @xmath58 as well as on @xmath65 .",
    "the values of @xmath132 corresponding to ( 37 ) are given in appendix a.",
    "in computing the void number densities we have used , among other things , our cmf and the spherical collapse . here",
    "we shall have the opportunity of checking separately how these assumptions works in explaining the structure of individual voids .",
    "we start with the spherically averaged mass density profile . a given void , characterized by its radius , @xmath60 , ( i.e. that of the largest sphere it can accommodate ) and the mean fractional mass density fluctuation within it , @xmath133 , has a unique profile",
    ". however , over the ensemble of all voids characterized by these two parameters the density profile varies .",
    "what we want to obtain is the mean profile over this ensemble and its dispersion both parameterized by @xmath133 and @xmath60 .    for the rare voids that we shall consider the void density profile is equal to that for a randomly chosen sphere of radius @xmath60 with inner fractional fluctuation @xmath133 .",
    "this is so because the fact of whether or not the sphere contains objects ( of the type defining the void ) can modify the properties of the profile only through the value of @xmath133 , which we hold by construction fixed .",

    "the correct derivation of this distribution can be made by a simple ( but tedious ) argument that we give in appendix b. we find for the probability distribution for @xmath10 ( at fixed @xmath3)conditioned to @xmath135 :    @xmath145    @xmath146    \\nonumber\\ ] ]    @xmath147    with it we have for the mean profile , @xmath148 :    @xmath149    this integral must extend only to @xmath150 values such that the integrand increases monotonically with @xmath150 . calling @xmath151 the argument of @xmath152 in eq.(44 ) and eq.([eq : eq15 ] ) one may check that the solution to equation :    @xmath153    may have more than one branch . a necessary and usually sufficient condition for equation ( [ eq : eq14 ] ) to be valid ( see appendix",
    "b ) is that a branch , @xmath154 , monotonically increasing with @xmath155 does exist .",
    "other branches correspond to profiles that have experienced a large amount of shell - crossing , so that expression ( [ eq : eq14 ] ) is not valid . in order to account only for the relevant @xmath154 branch",

    "the difference between this procedure and the former gives a clue as to their accuracy .",
    "they are exact only when they agree ; otherwise none of them is exact , the former giving a somewhat better result . in a similar way we may obtain @xmath157 , and the profile dispersion @xmath158 :    @xmath159    as long as the dispersion of the profile is small , which according to the simulations of @xcite holds up to @xmath160 for the @xmath161 void ,",
    "the mean actual profile should not differ much from the transformed mean linear profile , which we call the most probable profile ( in fact , it is very nearly so ) .",
    "now , from eq.([eq : eq14 ] ) and ( 44 ) we see that the most probable profile is essentially given by the center of the gaussian ( in eq.[eq : eq13 ] ; i.e. the mean inner profile ) :    @xmath162    where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the lagrangian radius .",
    "transforming @xmath10 into @xmath53 through the spherical model relationship @xmath34 ( equation ( [ eq : eq6 ] ) ) , and using :    @xmath163    with @xmath164 we may write :    @xmath165    since    @xmath166    this equation defines implicitly the `` most probable '' profile @xmath167 parameterized by @xmath60 and @xmath133 .",

    "comparing these two figures it is apparent that , although both profiles are very similar within the voids , the mean profile is substantially steeper than the most probable profile at the boundary of the voids .",
    "this is due to the asymmetry between the upper and lower one sigma profiles .",

    "so far in this work we have been dealing only with voids defined by dark matter halos .",
    "however , the number density of voids defined by galaxies may be obtained in the same way as those defined by dm halos .    to obtain the number density of the latter we implicitly had to determine the relative biasing of halos above certain mass with respect to the matter .",

    "@xmath242 was obtained by studying the dependence of the lagrangian fractional fluctuation of the number of protohalos within a sphere on the linear density fluctuation , @xmath53 , within it .    for voids defined by galaxies of certain type above a given luminosity , @xmath243 , we must use in expression ( [ eq : eq1000 ] ) @xmath244 , which describes the initial statistical clustering of the protogalaxies , instead of @xmath242 .",
    "@xmath244 is obtained by means of the unconditional , @xmath245 , and conditional , @xmath246 , luminosity function in the same way as @xmath242 was derived by means of the conditional and unconditional mass functions .    to obtain @xmath245 and @xmath247 , we shall first assume that there exist a universal ( independent of the environment ) conditional luminosity function , @xmath248 ( * ? ? ?",

    "( [ eq : eq5 ] ) and @xmath256 given by :    @xmath257    more generally , one might consider the plausible possibility that void galaxies are a systematically different population ( szomoru et al .",
    "1996a ; el - ad & piran 2000 ; peebles 2001 ; rojas et al . 2004 ) or , in mathematical terms , that the conditional luminosity function depends on the environment .",
    "evidence to this dependence on theoretical ground have been recently pointed out by gao et al.(2005 ) who reported a dependence of halo clustering on environment through the environmental dependence on halo formation history .    assuming this dependence enters only through the environmental density we should then use @xmath258 , where @xmath95 stands for the present linear value of the fractional density fluctuation within a sphere centered at the galaxy and with radius @xmath259 ( this radius should be large enough to define a local environment but substantially smaller than the scale length on which these environment change , i.e. large voids ) .",
    "the only change with respect to the previous case is that now to obtain @xmath245 and @xmath247 expression ( 25 ) must be multiplied by the probability distribution for @xmath95 at @xmath57 , @xmath260 , and integrated over @xmath95 .    up to here",
    "we have been using a non - uniform poissonian clustering model : the probability per time unit for a galaxy to form at a given halo may be a function of time and some underlying field , but does not depend on whether or not some galaxies has previously formed in its neighborhood .",
    "dark matter halos formed from gaussian initial conditions may be shown to obey a poissonian model .",
    "this is a consequence of the validity for them of the peak - background splitting approximation ( * ? ? ?",
    "however for galaxies this does not need to be true if the conditional luminosity function depends on the presence of neighboring galaxies : a general model containing these possibilities is given in @xcite . to work within this general model we only need to change @xmath261 in eq.([eq : eq1 ] ) by @xmath262 where @xmath263 is an additional parameter to be determined from observations ( for poissonian model @xmath264 ) .    by means of these expressions",

    "the extension of the unconditional mass function that we have developed increases very substantially the reach of the original useful tool . not only is the extension formally exact under the generally satisfied conditions that we have discussed , but it provides the local number density of collapsed objects at any distance from the point at which the constraint is evaluated .",
    "this is an essential point for the present work as well as for several other applications , since the fractional number density varies strongly from the center to the boundary of the void ( the first value is roughly the cubic root of the second one for any mass ) .",
    "previous procedures for obtaining the conditional mass function assume that the mass function and the condition are evaluated at the same point . in principle",
    ", one could follow those procedures to obtain the mass function at any distance from the center of the void .",
    "but this is rather complex and can , at most , provide a good fitting formula .",
    "however , as we have shown , once the unconditional mass function has been obtained by deriving a fitting formula through the mentioned procedures ( or any other ) and calibrating it by means of numerical simulations , its extension to the conditional case can immediately be obtained , without having to repeat the derivation of the fitting formula and its calibration .    this formalism has allowed us to obtain the mean fractional number density of collapsed objects of given mass within a void as a function of the fractional mass density within it .",
    "this has been used within the general formalism that we have described here to obtain the number density of voids with radius above a given value .",
    "we have compared our results with those found in numerical simulations , checking that for sufficiently rare voids our procedure gives very good results .",
    "furthermore , using @xmath11 as given by the spherical expansion / collapse approximation seems to be enough within present uncertainties .",
    "note , however , that we have not checked separately to a sufficient extent the accuracy of the relationship between @xmath7 and @xmath2 ( eq.(1 ) ) on the one hand and the accuracy of our computation of @xmath7 on the other .",
    "we intend to do this by means of more detailed simulations that will allow us to eliminate some minor uncertainties thereby increasing the accuracy of our procedure .",
    "one relevant issue that we have not addressed here is the redshift distortions .",
    "note that our formalism correspond to real space , while observations are made in redshift space .",
    "recently , a procedure for correcting the observed statistics for redshift distortions has been developed ( patiri et al . 2005 ) .",
    "however , in a future work we intend to complement our formalism so that we could make predictions of voids statistics directly in redshift space .",
    "our formalism provides a simple relation between properties of the galaxy formation process and galaxy distribution statistics . using this relation we may infer those properties from the observed distribution . in this manner , in order to asses the consistency of a model of galaxy formation with void statistics it is not necessary to carry out complex numerical simulations with a large dynamical range but only to demand those models to show the properties ( i.e. the conditional luminosity function ) inferred through our procedure from void statistics .",
    "furthermore , the effect of the change of any parameter of the model may be estimated immediately .",

    "in an alternative and more explicit procedure , instead of fitting directly the dependence of @xmath54 on @xmath65 and @xmath53 , we first obtain the dependence of the fractional halo number density at @xmath91 , which we call @xmath266 , on @xmath65 and @xmath53 .",
    "that is , before dealing with the mean fractional fluctuation within the sphere of radius @xmath58 we deal with its value at the center of this sphere .",
    "we find that @xmath266 may be approximated very accurately ( for @xmath267 ) by :    @xmath268    where for @xmath65 between @xmath187 and @xmath269 :    @xmath270    @xmath271    for larger masses we have :    @xmath270    @xmath272    to obtain the fractional density fluctuation of the number density of collapsed objects with masses above @xmath65 , at a distance @xmath57 from the center of the sphere under consideration , @xmath273 we simply need to note that :    @xmath274    where in the first parenthesis we have noted that in the procedure for extending the umf expression the dependence on @xmath53 enters essentially through    @xmath275    which as we have seen ( eq.[eq : eq110 ] ) is independent of @xmath65 .",
    "the second parenthesis accounts for the differences between the expressions that substitute @xmath276 in the extensions of umf expression at @xmath91 and at a given @xmath57 .",
    "this parenthesis is , for the values we shall use , very close to @xmath45 and may be neglected .",
    "having @xmath273 at any @xmath57 we may immediately obtain @xmath277 by computing its mean value within the sphere :    @xmath278    here , we have used eq.([eq : eq999 ] ) and eq.(a1 ) , setting @xmath279 .",
    "we find again that this expression may be accurately fitted by eq.([eq : eq12 ] ) with @xmath280 and @xmath129 approximately equal to @xmath281 in all the range of masses considered .",
    "@xmath54 is the mean ( within @xmath58 ) fractional fluctuation of the number density in lagrangian coordinates ( i.e. , before the halos move along with mass ) .",
    "this fluctuation is due to the statistical clustering , in the initial field , of the protohalos under consideration ( those with mass above @xmath65 ) .",
    "to obtain expression ( [ eq : eq14 ] ) for the probability distribution for the mean value of @xmath10 within @xmath3 , we compute first the probability that @xmath282 ( where @xmath150 is some given value ) , which we represent by @xmath283 . if at a certain @xmath57 value , @xmath284 , @xmath285 ( the linear value of the fractional density fluctuation within lagrangian radius @xmath57 ) were equal to @xmath286 ( the linear value corresponding through spherical collapse to an actual value @xmath150 ) , then the sphere concentric with the void and with lagrangian radius @xmath284 show a mean inner fractional fluctuation equal to @xmath150 corresponding to an expansion by a factor @xmath287 and , if its present radius is @xmath3 , we must have @xmath288 .",
    "if @xmath285 were less than @xmath286 then the actual @xmath10 within this sphere ( with lagrangian radius @xmath284 ) will be less than @xmath150 .",
    "so , the sphere with lagrangian radius , @xmath284 , would have expanded by a factor larger than @xmath287 its present size being then larger than @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the sphere with present radius @xmath3 would have expanded from an initial one with @xmath289 ( neglecting shell crossing ) and , assuming that the profile is monotonically increasing ( which is obviously true for the most probable profile , but is also so for any realization with non - negligible probability ) , @xmath290 shall be less than @xmath291 , and consequently , @xmath134 shall be less than @xmath150 .",
    "we may then write :        where ( b1 ) denote the fact that the probability that @xmath10 be smaller than @xmath150 at @xmath3 is , by the above arguments , equal to the probability that @xmath53 be smaller than @xmath286 at @xmath284 .",
    "but for fixed @xmath284 and with the condition @xmath135 , @xmath53 follows distribution ( [ eq : eq13 ] ) , so , expression ( 43 ) follows immediately .",
    "we have assumed above that shell crossing does not occur , however this may be shown to be the case in the relevant applications .",
    "note that the relevant shell crossing here is that on the scale of the void , that is the shell crossing experienced by the mass field filtered on the scale of the void . on much smaller scales",
    "there is obviously shell crossing , but this is irrelevant to our argument ."
