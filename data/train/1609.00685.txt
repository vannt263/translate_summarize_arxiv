    ". the atomic chain can be hence formally described by the following hamiltonian @xcite @xmath29 obviously this heuristic scenario ( [ proximized ] ) does not capture any electronic state outside the energy gap window @xmath30 , but they are meaningless for the present discussion .",

    "the optimal value of @xmath40 is reached at site @xmath41 ( and @xmath42 ) , whereas the most peripheral chain sites reveal the reduced pairing amplitude . the spatial variation shown in figure [ fig3 ]",
    "can be regarded as ` intrinsic inhomogeneity ' arising from the finite - size effects .",
    "such inhomogeneity is not captured by the popular kitaev toy model @xcite , but it has important physical consequences that are observed experimentally .",
    "actually what matters for a spatial extent of the majorana quasiparticle states is the magnitude of the intersite pairing between identical spin electrons @xmath43 displayed in fig .",

    "such feature perfectly coincides with the real experimental data reported by the princeton group @xcite .",
    "the strongest zero - bias enhancement of the subgap stm tunneling corresponds to the point 2 in figure 4 of the report by e.  yazdani @xcite .",
    "its distance from the chain edge is roughly @xmath48 8  , therefore we conclude that the majorana feature is indeed centered at 4@xmath49 site .",

    "with increasing disorder ( but below @xmath66 ) the zero - energy states gradually build up .",
    "we suspect that they originate from the majorana states that are pinned by disorder on internal sites ( as explained in section iv ) . with further increase of @xmath54 ( above @xmath66 )",
    "the zero energy spectral function slowly diminishes .",
    "we assign this tendency to evolution from the nontrivial to trivial superconducting phases .",
    "such changeover is smooth , regardless of the atomic chain size @xmath31 ( see the solid lines in fig .",

    "additional indication that strong disorder triggers the trivial superconducting state is provided by evolution of @xmath67 at finite energy @xmath68 , corresponding to the soft gap regime ( see appendix b ) .",

    "[ middle_point ] indeed shows that strong disorder closes the soft gap , what is evidenced by saturation of @xmath69 for large @xmath54 , inducing the ordinary andreev / shiba states .    what is interesting , for @xmath70 the spectral function @xmath58 scales with the system size @xmath31 , whereas only minor statistical fluctuations show up above @xmath66 .",
    "while for any finite disorder all the states are localized ( what is seen by means of the _ inverse participation ratio _ method , not presented here ) , it may suggest that at @xmath66 the localization length changes abruptly .",
    "the critical character of @xmath66 is even more pronounced in the geometrically averaged local density of states ( see appendix [ sec : tdos ] ) .",
    "caused by the random coupling @xmath50 . ]    in analogy to the random site energies ( discussed in previous subsection ) we have studied the inhomogeneous coupling between the chain atoms and superconducting substrate @xmath71 .",
    "physically such situation may occur when the wave - functions of atoms randomly overlap with the wave - functions of itinerant electrons in superconducting substrate .",
    "this kind of disorder ( that appears in off - diagonal green s function of the nambu representation ) is known to have detrimental influence on superconductivity of bulk materials @xcite .",
    "[ offdiag_disorder ] shows the results obtained for several amplitudes @xmath54 ( in units of @xmath72 ) of the off - diagonal disorder imposed on the reference value @xmath73 .",
    "we roughly observe a similar tendency as in fig .",
    "[ diag_disorder ] , but a more careful examination indicates that nonuniform coupling @xmath50 is slightly less influential on the majorana quasiparticles . in this case",
    "the dominant effect comes from the proximity - induced pairing , that becomes partially suppressed by randomizing @xmath50 .",
    "similar conclusions have been independently reported by wang _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "another interesting situation can be caused by single impurities existing either in the rashba chain or attached to it .",
    "we briefly address such problem in this section .     of the atomic chain , where the hopping integral between the internal 35-th and 36-th sites is reduced to @xmath741 , 0.6 , 0.2 , 0 ( from top to bottom ) .",
    "]      let us consider the following ` gedanken experiment ' that effectively produces an additional pair of the majorana quasiparticles .",
    "the simplest possibility to achieve it is by partitioning the rashba chain through a reduced hopping integral @xmath75 between some neighboring internal sites . for specific numerical calculations",
    "we have assumed that such reduced hopping @xmath75 occurs between the 35@xmath76 and 36@xmath49 sites of our atomic chain , consisting of 70 atoms .",
    "we have checked , that particular choice of the reduced interatomic hopping is not crucial as long as it is well in - between the majorana quasiparticles .    in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we illustrate emergence of an additional pair of the majorana quasiparticles induced by reducing the hopping integral @xmath77 ( which can be regarded as a particular realization of the single impurity ) .",
    "this process gradually splits the rashba chain into separate segments , therefore one pair of the finite - energy ( andreev ) states gradually evolves in to the zero - energy majorana states .",
    "this phenomenon is rather obvious .",
    "however , another very intriguing observation regards the majorana states existing at the edges of uniform chain ( i.e.  for @xmath78 ) . these ( external ) majorana quasiparticles seem to be completely unaffected by splitting of the chain .",
    "we believe that such unusual phenomenon beautifully illustrates the non - local character of the topological edge states .",
    "doubling of the majorana quasiparticles has been also predicted for interface between the chain segments where spin - orbit coupling @xmath79 changes its sign @xcite .",
    "practically the same effect can be also achieved if we place either the diagonal or off - diagonal impurity in one of the internal sites of rashba chain . in practice , however , such ` internal impurity ' has to be extremely distinct from all remaining constituents of the chain .",
    "our numerical calculations showed that the impurity potential has to be very large ( @xmath80 ) to effectively break the chain into separate pieces , generating an additional pair of the majorana quasiparticles .",
    "this situation is hardly probable in realistic systems , therefore we discard it from present considerations .",
    "let us finally analyze what happens when a ( normal ) quantum impurity is coupled to the rashba chain at the sites , which host the majorana quasiparticle .",
    "similar issue has been previously addressed , considering the impurity coupled to the very end of kitaev chain @xcite . in finite size rashba chain",
    "the maximum probability of the majorana quasiparticles does not coincide with the very last sites , but they are located around 4@xmath49 site from the atomic edge ( as reported experimentally @xcite ) .",
    "for this reason we expect the strongest influence of the majorana quasiparticle on the normal quantum impurity when the latter is side - attached to 4@xmath49 site of the rashba chain .    on a formal level",
    ", we studied the model hamiltonian ( [ proximized ] ) supplemented with the term @xmath81 describing the quantum impurity of energy @xmath82 attached to site @xmath83 of the topological wire . in fig .",
    "[ proximity_effect ] we present electronic spectrum of the quantum impurity @xmath84 obtained for several couplings @xmath85 , as indicated . with increasing @xmath86",
    "we observe appearance of the zero - energy state , that absorbs more and more spectral weight .",
    "this feature is caused by the proximity effect , which can be considered as ` leakage ' of majorana mode onto normal quantum impurities @xcite . as a minor remark ,",
    "let us notice that the finite energy ( andreev / shiba ) states do leak into the normal quantum impurity as well .",
    "summarizing this section , we conclude that various types of quantum impurities may play important role for the majorana quasiparticles of the rashba chain .",
    "the reduced hopping integral or the strong local potential ( both in the single particle and pairing channels ) can effectively break the chain into pieces , so that additional pair of majorana quasiparticles emerges . on the other hand , any nanoscopic object coupled to the existing majorana quasiparticle absorbs such exotic entity in exactly the same way as the superconducting or magnetic order spreading onto some neighboring normal regions .",
    "we studied the subgap electronic spectrum of the inhomogeneous rashba chain deposited on @xmath1-wave superconducting substrate , where the strong spin - orbit coupling combined with the zeeman effect induce the zero - energy majorana quasiparticles near its edges .",
    "we analyzed the spatial extent of such quasiparticles due to intrinsic inhomogeneity caused by the finite size effects . in accordance with the stm experimental observations @xcite the zero - bias enhancement",
    "is mostly pronounced by the majorana quasiparticle at 4@xmath49 site from the chain edge .",
    "we also investigated stability of the majorana quasiparticles against various types of the disorder , that are likely to occur in realistic stm - type configurations ( schematically displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . despite a common belief , that the majorana quasiparticles are robust to environmental influence",
    "we have shown that this is not truly the case .",
    "we find that sufficiently strong disorder is detrimental for the majorana quasiparticles , causing a changeover from the nontrivial to trivial superconducting phases .",
    "single quantum impurities have also very unusual interplay with the majorana quasiparticle states . under specific conditions they can effectively induce additional pairs of the majorana states , when the strong impurity scattering affects any internal site of the rashba chain .",
    "this process is analogous to partitioning the chain into separate pieces , bringing to life new majoranas .",
    "it is amazing , however , that the existing ( external ) majorana modes are practically left intact by such partitioning .",
    "this unusual phenomenon is a signature of their non - local character and could be useful for constructing the quantum bits out of majorana quasiparticles .",
    "we also have shown that majorana quasiparticles can spread onto nanoscopic objects coupled to them .",
    "such proximity effect can be helpful for designing some novel tunneling hetero - structures to indirectly probe the majorana quasiparticles , for instance by the quantum interference .",
