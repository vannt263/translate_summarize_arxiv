    "at present , the two most fundamental theories in physics are quantum theory and general relativity , which is a classical theory of the gravitational field .",
    "these two theories are incompatible .",
    "a major problem therefore is to unify these two theories in the sense that they are approximations of a deeper quantum theory of gravity .",
    "perhaps the deepest level at which the incompatibility between the two theories is manifest is in the fact that general relativity is local whereas quantum mechanics is non - local .",
    "this is reflected in the formulation of general relativity geometrically in _ space - time _ , whereas quantum mechanics is formulated in _",
    "hilbert spaces _ whose elements ( state vectors or wave functions ) have non local properties in space - time .    this fundamental incompatibility will be described in more detail in section 2 .",
    "the translation group elements , which are non local observables , are used to represent the non - local aspects of the quantum wave function , as shown for example in interference phenomena , through their expectation values . in section 3 , the non local quantum phenomena , such as the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect and it generalization to non - abelian gauge fields , are described by means of gauge invariant non local observables that are elements of the direct product of the translation group and the gauge group , following earlier work of aharonov and the author . the gravitational ab effect around a cosmic string",
    "is considered in section 4 .",
    "it is shown that this effect may be described as the change in the expectation value of a poincare group element .",
    "this naturally leads to a description of the gravitational field by means of the poincare group .",
    "in a curved space - time , owing to the locality of all the interactions , it is not meaningful _ a priori _ to compare two tangent vectors @xmath1 and @xmath2 at different space - time points @xmath3 and @xmath4 . but @xmath2 may be parallel transported with respect to a _ connection _ along a curve joining @xmath4 and @xmath3 and the resulting vector @xmath5 can be compared with @xmath1 .",
    "the different such vectors @xmath5 corresponding to different choices of the curve are related by holonomy transformations ( parallel transport around a closed curve ) .",
    "thus ironically , the locality of general relativity leads us to consider holonomy transformations which appear to be non locally associated with an entire closed curve in space - time .",
    "similarly , in the presence of a gauge field , owing to the locality of the gauge field interaction , it is not possible to compare two internal vectors ( which belong to a representation of the gauge group ) at different points in space- time .",
    "the holonomy transformation in the case of the electromagnetic gauge field is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the @xmath8vector potential that acts on a wave function and @xmath9 is the charge operator .",
    "there is , however , a fundamental difference between the non - locality represented by ( [ holonomy ] ) and the apparent non- locality of the holonomy transformation in a gravitational field .",
    "this is due to the soldering form , known to mathematicians as the canonical @xmath10form , in a gravitational field , which ` solders ' the parallel transportable vectors to the tangent space at each point on space - time @xcite .",
    "consequently , it is possible to relate the orientation of the vector that is parallel transported along a curve with the orientation of the tangent vector to the curve at each point on the curve , which can not be done for the parallel transport of an ` internal ' vector by means of the gauge field connection . in particular , while the holonomy transformation is unchanged if the enclosed ` flux ' is changed by one ` quantum ' , the two situations may be distinguished in the gravitational case by the above mentioned comparison with the tangent vector , but they can not be distinguished in the electromagnetic or gauge field case @xcite .",
    "this fundamental difference exists between gravitational and gauge fields even when the vector parallel transported is classical , because the soldering form is part of the gravitational field .",
    "but there is a further quantum non - locality that exists in the non - local nature of the wave function in both gravity and gauge fields .",
    "this quantum non - locality may be seen already in the simple double slit experiment .",
    "suppose the two slits are separated by a distance @xmath11 in the y - direction and the quantum wave is moving in the x - direction that is normal to the two slits .",
    "soon after the wave passes the double slit , it is a superposition of two wave packets at the two slits : @xmath12 for simplicity , it is assumed here that the two wave packets are the same except for the phase difference @xmath13 .",
    "however , _ no local experiments done on the non overlapping wave packets emerging from the slits could determine this phase difference_. for example , the expectation values of the local variables @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is any positive integer , give no information about @xmath16 .",
    "( this is easily verified from @xmath17 in the coordinate representation . ) but @xmath18 this @xmath19 is of course observed when the two wave packets overlap subsequently to produce inerference fringes .",
    "this justifies treating the translational group element @xmath20 as an observable , and @xmath21 was called modular momentum by aharonov et al @xcite .",
    "the reason why @xmath22 contains more information than all the @xmath23 is because @xmath24 vanishes in a region between the wave packets and therefore @xmath25 is not analytic .",
    "however , the latter is well defined through the action of @xmath26 on the momentum space wave function of @xmath24 by multiplication .",
    "a great importance of the observable @xmath27 lies in the fact that it determines whether the state is a pure state or a mixture .",
    "suppose we have a mixture of the above mentioned localized wave packets , denoted @xmath28 and @xmath29 , instead of the above pure state @xmath30 .",
    "the density matrix of this mixture is @xmath31 .",
    "now @xmath32 gives the same results for the observation of all local observables as the density matrix @xmath33 of the pure state , i.e. @xmath34 for every local observable @xmath35 .",
    "however , @xmath36 , whereas @xmath37 , which is the same as eqn . (",
    "[ alpha ] ) above .",
    "here @xmath38 because @xmath39 is the density matrix of a coherent superposition of the two wave packets unlike @xmath32 .",
    "hence @xmath27 may be used to represent the quantum coherence between the two wave packets .",
    "this remark becomes important when we probe the gravitational field by means of quantum mechanical particles , instead of the classical particles that einstein used to obtain his principle of equivalence .",
    "if we probe the classical gravitational field using a particle whose state is @xmath24 , and measure @xmath24 by means of local observables ,",
    "this changes it into a _ mixture _ or is indistinguishable from a mixture .",
    "this is because the interaction of a classical gravitational field is local , which enables it to be incorporated into the space - time geometry . in this way",
    "we determine the _ classical _ gravitational field and the associated space - time geometry .",
    "we need a non local observable , such as the translational group element @xmath40 in order to probe the quantum coherence of the gravitational field .",
    "also , the backreaction of @xmath24 that represents the superposed wave packets requires quantum gravity , which should be non - local because of the above non - local aspect of @xmath24 .",
    "hence , although non - local operators can not be observed by present day experiments because of the locality of the interactions , their study may be useful in understanding the quantum aspects of the gravitational field .",
    "this requires that @xmath27 should be generalized to incorporate the change in space - time geometry due to the gravitational field which will be attempted in section 4 .",
    "but in the next section we shall consider the generalization of @xmath27 to gauge fields , which are easier than the gravitational field because they do not require modification of the minkowski space - time and it associated symmetries .",
    "the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect @xcite , which is a non local interaction between the wave function and the electromagnetic field , gives important information about both the field and the wave function .",
    "it shows , on the one hand , that the complete description of the electromagnetic field are given by holonomy transformations ( [ holonomy ] ) associated with arbitrary closed curves .",
    "the field strength @xmath41 has too little information in a multiply connected region , while the phase @xmath42 has too much information about the electromagnetic field because it may be changed by @xmath43 ( @xmath15 is an integer ) , without observable consequences @xcite , as mentioned in the previous section .",
    "since ( [ holonomy ] ) is an element of the @xmath44 group , the ab effect is telling us that the electromagnetic field is a @xmath44 gauge field . on the other hand",
    ", the ab effect also shows the non local quantum coherence of the wave function discussed in the previous section .",
    "it is therefore natural to try to describe this effect using quantities that depend on both the wave function and the field , as will be done shortly .    the usual way of explaining the ab effect is by means of the gauge invariant holonomy transformation ( [ holonomy ] ) associated with _ closed curves _ , which depends only on the external field .",
    "however , gauge invariant quantities associated with _",
    "open curves _ that depend on both the field and the wave function were used previously to study the ab effect in superconductors @xcite .",
    "an example of such a quantity for a particle with charge @xmath45 at a given time @xmath46 is @xcite @xmath47 it is easy to verify that ( [ z ] ) is invariant under the gauge transformation @xmath48 where @xmath49 stands for @xmath50 , which will also be denoted by @xmath51 . at present , for simplicity , the integral in ( [ z ] ) is taken along the straight line joining @xmath52 and @xmath53 , although the gauge invariance of @xmath54 holds more generally for integral along any piece - wise differentiable curve joining these two points .    to construct an observable corresponding to the gauge invariant quantities @xmath55 , consider the tranformation @xmath56",
    ", where @xcite @xmath57 it follows that @xmath58 the integrand of the last expression is the same as the @xmath55 given by ( [ z ] ) , which is therefore more general than ( [ < f > ] ) . since ( [ z ] ) is gauge invariant , so is ( [ f ] ) .",
    "therefore , ( [ f ] ) is gauge covariant .",
    "consider now the translational group element @xmath59 .",
    "this operator determines the quantum coherence of a wave function , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "this is shown dramatically in the ab effect @xcite due to interference of two wave packets around a solenoid .",
    "it was shown by aharonov et al @xcite that while there is no exchange of @xmath60 for any positive integer @xmath15 , there is an exchange of @xmath61 between the solenoid and the electron . to see this ,",
    "consider a wave that is a superposition of two localized wave packets , as in ( [ wave ] ) , which pass on opposite sides of the solenoid , with @xmath13 now being the ab phase caused by the solenoid . now , while @xmath62 is independent of @xmath13 , @xmath63 depends on @xmath13 for appropriate choice of @xmath64 as shown by ( [ alpha ] ) .",
    "therefore , while @xmath62 is unaffected by the ab phase , @xmath65 is changed by it .",
    "this difference is due to the non locality of the quantum wave which , as mentioned in the previous section , exists due to the quantum coherence of the two wave packets .",
    "but @xmath13 in the above analysis is gauge dependent .",
    "consider therefore the operator @xmath66 that is obtained by replacing the canonical momentum @xmath67 in the translation with the gauge - covariant kinetic momentum @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is a time - dependent operator in the schrdinger picture that acts on the hilbert space according to the rule @xmath70 here @xmath71 is any element of the hilbert space of the particle and @xmath72 is the usual classical vector potential in space - time",
    ". if the electromagnetic field is also quantized then @xmath72 would be the expectation value of a time - independent schrdinger operator representing the quantized field with respect to a schrdinger coherent state of the field at time @xmath46 .",
    "for this reason , i shall always let @xmath73 act on the schrdinger wave function of the particle at time @xmath46 , because the latter wave function multiplies the coherent state wave function of the field at the same time in the present approximation .",
    "thus this restriction may be deduced from a deeper theory in which all degrees of freedom are quantized .",
    "then the wave function resulting from the action of @xmath74 is gauge - covariant owing to the fact that @xmath75 is gauge - covariant .",
    "also , @xmath76 @xcite , i.e. for every wave function @xmath77 , @xmath78 to prove this , note that ( [ f ] ) is valid in an axial gauge in which @xmath79 .",
    "also , both sides of ( [ f ] ) are gauge - covariant , as shown earlier .",
    "hence , ( [ f ] ) is valid in every gauge .",
    "more generally , define the operator @xmath80 that acts on the hilbert space according to @xcite @xmath81 where @xmath82 is _ any _ piece - wise differentiable curve in @xmath83 and @xmath84 is a curve in physical space that is congruent to @xmath82 and joins an arbitrary point @xmath85 to @xmath86 . here",
    ", @xmath64 is independent of @xmath85 but depends on @xmath82 . in the special case when @xmath82 is a straight line , @xmath80 is the same as @xmath87 .",
    "also , for any piece - wise differentiable curve @xmath82 , @xmath80 can be shown to be gauge - covariant in the same way as @xmath87 was shown to be gauge - covariant . from now",
    "onwards , the @xmath88 over @xmath84 will be dropped , for simplicity , if no confusion will arise .",
    "consider now the ab effect @xcite in which a wave packet is split by a beam splitter into two wave packets that go past on two sides of a solenoid ( figure 1 ) .",
    "a wave packet is split at the beam splitter m into two wave packets a and b that go around the solenoid s and interfere at i. when the imaginary curve @xmath84 crosses the solenoid , the _ gauge invariant _ expectation value of @xmath89 changes .",
    "the wave function of the particle is @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the wave functions of the two wave packets",
    ". then we may write @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are variable curves outside the solenoid that begin at a point @xmath96 on the beam splitter , and @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the unperturbed solutions of schrdinger s equation in the absence of @xmath99 .",
    "it is easily verified that @xmath91 and @xmath92 are solutions of schrdinger s equation with @xmath99 minimally coupled .",
    "suppose the displacement between the centers of the wave packets is @xmath100 .",
    "then @xmath101 on using ( [ wavepackets ] ) , where @xmath102 is the closed curve formed by @xmath103 and the reverse of @xmath94 .",
    "as the two wave packets move past the solenoid , @xmath84 crosses the solenoid .",
    "then , @xmath104 changes from @xmath105 to @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the magnetic flux enclosed by the solenoid .",
    "this has been shown for the special case when @xmath84 is a straight line joining the wave packets in a special gauge @xcite .",
    "but the present gauge invariant treatment which is valid for arbitrary @xmath84 has the following advantages : a ) there is nothing special about the time when the imaginary straight line joining the wave packets crosses the solenoid , because for other choices of the curve @xmath84 , this curve would cross the solenoid at different times .",
    "b ) even at a given time @xmath46 , @xmath84 may be chosen to be on either side of the magnetic flux , which correspond to @xmath108 or @xmath106 .",
    "consider a circular superconducting ring enclosing the magnetic flux @xmath107 that has @xmath109 as a diameter .",
    "the ring is interrupted by a josphson junction on one side of this diameter .",
    "then @xmath84 may be chosen to be through the semi - circular ring on either side of this diameter .",
    "for these two choices , @xmath110 would take two possible values that differ by the factor @xmath106 .",
    "this difference is responsible for the josephson current through the josephson junction . to summarize , the usual ab effect described in fig .",
    "1 as well as the ab effect in a superconducting ring may be understood as due to the change in @xmath110 that depends on the open curve @xmath84 . but this change depends on the holonomy transformation ( [ holonomy ] ) associated with a closed curve .",
    "the results in the previous section naturally generalize to non abelian gauge fields @xcite . for an arbitrary gauge field , ( [ gamma ] ) is generalized to @xmath111 where @xmath112 generate the gauge group , and @xmath113 denotes path ordering , which is necessary because @xmath114 at different points do not commute in general . in the special case when @xmath84 is a straight line , @xmath115 this result may be proved , as in the abelian case , using the gauge covariance of both sides of ( [ g ] ) and noting that ( [ g ] ) holds in the axial gauge in which there is no contribution from the non abelian vector potential .",
    "also , this result can be generalized to an arbitrary ( piece - wise differentiable ) curve @xmath82 , i.e. @xmath116 where @xmath113 denotes path ordering .",
    "the result ( [ group ] ) implies that the operators @xmath117 form a group , which in general is infinite dimensional .    also , the ab effect described in fig .",
    "1 may be generalized to the case when the flux through the cylinder is due to an arbitrary gauge field .",
    "the wave function is given by ( [ psi ] ) , where now @xmath118 then , @xmath119 where @xmath102 is the closed curve , as defined before , beginning and ending at @xmath96 .",
    "the gauge invariance of this expression follows from the fact that in ( [ napackets ] ) the parallel transport operators ( path ordered integrals ) begin at @xmath120 .",
    "therefore , under a local gauge transformation @xmath121 , the unperturbed wave functions @xmath122 and @xmath123 must undergo the global gauge transformation @xmath124 in order that @xmath125 and @xmath126 transform covariantly to @xmath127 and @xmath128 , respectively . the ab effect in the superconducting ring",
    "may be generalized to the ab effect due to an arbitrary gauge field flux that arises from the generalization of the josephson effect to a non abelian gauge theory @xcite . in both these cases ,",
    "as discussed in the previous section for the @xmath44 gauge theory , the generalized ab effect arises from the change in @xmath110 due to the crossing of the flux by @xmath84 , where now @xmath89 is given by ( [ gammagauge ] ) .    extending these results to the gravitational case ,",
    "however , is difficult because of the fundamental locality of the gravitational field due to space - time curvature @xcite . to this end , consider the gravitational ab effect due to a cosmic string .",
    "in particular , in the experiment described in fig .",
    "1 , the solenoid may be replaced by a cosmic string . outside the cosmic string ,",
    "the curvature and torsion vanish , which is analogous to the vanishing of the electromagnetic field strength outside the solenoid .",
    "define a hilbert space @xmath129 to consist of @xmath130 functions that have support outside the cosmic string .",
    "now generalize @xmath89 to include the gravitational field @xcite : @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the soldering form mentioned in section 2 , @xmath133 is the linear connection form , and @xmath134 and @xmath135 generate the space - time translations and lorentz transformations in the hilbert space @xmath129 .",
    "hence , @xmath136 for simplicity , suppose that there is no gauge field present .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the gravitational phase shift is determined by @xmath137 when @xmath102 encloses the cosmic string .",
    "the part of @xmath137 that contributes to the phase shifts are symmetries of the space - time geometry of the cosmic string .",
    "so , again the change in @xmath110 due to @xmath84 crossing the cosmic string ( which makes @xmath102 that was defined below ( [ < ab > ] ) enclose the cosmic string ) determines the gravitational ab effect in this case .",
    "the generalization of the above results to an arbitrary gravitational field will be discussed elsewhere .",
