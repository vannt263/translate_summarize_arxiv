    "numerical studies of lattice regularized qcd face the problem of lattice discretization errors which complicate the extraction of physical results in the continuum limit . this problem has been addressed ever since the formulation of a systematic improvement scheme for gauge theories by symanzik @xcite . aside from the",
    "now widely used symanzik improved gauge actions it also led to tree - level improved actions for the fermion sector of qcd like the naik @xcite and p4 @xcite staggered fermion actions as well as the clover @xcite and ( truncated ) perfect actions for wilson fermions @xcite .",
    "the reduction of cut - off effects plays a particularly important role in studies of qcd thermodynamics where the relevant observables , like energy density or pressure , are dimension four operators and the numerical signal for these observables thus drops like the lattice spacing to the fourth power . this forces one to perform calculations on rather coarse lattices on which discretization errors can be significant .",
    "in fact , this has been observed early on in studies of the bulk thermodynamics of su(3 ) gauge theories @xcite and the efficiency of improved actions for studies of gauge theories at high temperature has been demonstrated @xcite .    in calculations on lattices with finite temporal extent @xmath1 , as required in thermodynamic studies , cut - off effects obscure strongly the approach to the infinite temperature , ideal gas limit .",
    "improvement schemes for thermodynamic calculations therefore have been developed and tested quite successfully in this limit for both the gauge as well as the fermion sector of qcd .",
    "the qualitative features of the cut - off dependence of thermodynamic observables present in this limiting case have been found to carry over to numerical calculations at finite temperatures and are significant even at temperatures as low as a few times the transition temperature to the quark - gluon plasma phase .    in this paper",
    "we will concentrate on a discussion of cut - off effects in the fermionic sector of bulk thermodynamic quantities that are given by derivatives of the qcd partition function with respect to temperature , @xmath2 , or quark chemical potential , @xmath3 .",
    "in particular the latter aspect has so far not been analyzed systematically .",
    "some results for the @xmath3-dependence of cut - off effects have been obtained for the naik and p4 staggered fermion actions @xcite , truncated perfect actions @xcite and for overlap fermions @xcite .",
    "in fact , in the latter case the question was raised whether the introduction of a non - zero chemical potential in the overlap formalism could spoil the leading order cut - off dependence of thermodynamic quantities and could reintroduce divergences of the type discussed in early studies of qcd at finite density @xcite .",
    "we proof here that this is not the case and give explicit results for the @xmath3-dependence of cut - off effects in leading and next - to - leading order in a large-@xmath1 expansion of bulk thermodynamics .",
    "we show that a non - vanishing chemical potential only modifies the expansion coefficients but does not change the structure of the expansion , _",
    "i.e. _ actions that are improved to @xmath0 at @xmath4 remain improved to that order also for @xmath5 .",
    "we will clarify the relation between the improvement of dispersion relations and the improvement of bulk thermodynamic observables and give explicit results for the large-@xmath1 expansion of the pressure calculated with staggered and wilson type actions .",
    "we furthermore show that these considerations carry over to chirally invariant fermion formulations such as overlap and domain wall fermions .",
    "we will analyze the relation between rotational invariance of quark propagators , improved dispersion relations and bulk thermodynamic observables in the next two sections .",
    "we further exemplify these results for naive staggered fermions as well as two popular improved staggered fermion actions , the naik @xcite and the p4 action @xcite in section [ se : stagg ] . in section [ se : wilson ] we consider fermion discretizations of the wilson type with general couplings on a hypercube of size @xmath6 .",

    "we will start our discussion of cut - off effects for free fermions which corresponds to the asymptotic infinite temperature limit of qcd by considering the simplest ( naive ) lattice discretization scheme used for the fermion sector of qcd .",
    "this will already demonstrate the main features of our analysis .",
    "for simplicity we also will suppress color and flavor factors , which are just multiplicative in the infinite temperature limit .",
    "the partition function for free fermions at temperature @xmath2 and for non - vanishing chemical potential @xmath3 , defined on a lattice of size @xmath7 , is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the volume and inverse temperature of the system ; @xmath11 denotes the lattice spacing and @xmath12 is the euclidean action for free fermions of mass @xmath13 .    in the simplest discretization scheme for fermionic actions derivatives",

    "we note that the transformation @xmath15 , @xmath16 leaves the path integral over the fermion fields invariant and shifts the entire @xmath3-dependence of the fermion action into the last time slice .",
    "the euclidean action thus only depends on the chemical potential in units of the temperature , @xmath17 .",
