    "burning up all fusion materials causes hydrodynamic instability due to lack of radiation pressure from inside the star .",
    "the immense gravitational pressure of the stellar envelope and/or overlying material causes the core of stars with mass @xmath7 to collapse at this point .",
    "the density of the compressed core material reaches a few times the nuclear density and a rising temperature helps iron dissociate into nucleons and alpha particles .",
    "infall of stellar material onto the core produces @xmath8 mev neutrinos by the process of electron capture on protons ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the density of neutrons in the core exceeds that of protons in this process , called _ neutronization_.",
    "initially the neutrinos are trapped within a radius called _ neutrinosphere _ because of a density @xmath10 g-@xmath11 . for progenitors of mass @xmath12 , the increasing degeneracy pressure of the neutrons leads to a rebound , which sends a shockwave through the core .",
    "while traversing through the core , the shockwave heats up material , dissociates more iron atoms and releases trapped @xmath13 from the neutrinosphere .",
    "neutrinos carry away @xmath14 erg of energy or roughly @xmath15 of the total gravitational binding energy in this bursting phase which lasts for a few milliseconds .",
    "the shockwave , however , does not reach the envelope to drive it away because of heavy energy loss and the star fails to explode into a supernova .",
    "the mechanisms envisaged to produce a successful supernova explosion , such as observed in nature , may be divided into two main categories despite many uncertainties such as the mass loss rate of the pre - supernova star and neutrino transport in the core , to name a few .",
    "the first is a _ revived shock _ model , for stars initially less massive than @xmath16 , where the core collapses to make a neutron star . in this case , the above - mentioned stalled supernova shock is re - energized by neutrino absorption on nucleons outside the stellar core ( @xmath17 ; @xmath18 ) , re - energizing them .",
    "the shock wave then reaches the envelope and expels it away . after the supernova explosion ,",
    "the stellar core cools down in next 10 s of seconds by emitting @xmath19 erg of energy in neutrinos of all flavors created by lepton pair annihilation ( @xmath20 ) , neutrino pair annihilation ( @xmath21 ) and nucleon bremsstrahlung ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "these neutrinos are thermal with a typical energy @xmath8 mev .",
    "a neutron star is left over after the stellar core cools down , following ejection of the envelope and outer core .    in the second scenario , which is the relevant case for the current review , a star initially more massive than @xmath23 undergoes core collapse .",
    "( a ) if the initial mass is @xmath24 , the core collapses initially to a neutron star , but after fall - back of additional core gas which did not reach ejection velocity , it collapses further to a black hole ( bh ) of mass in excess of the chandrasekhar mass ( the neutron degeneracy pressure not being sufficient to counteract gravity for this mass ) .",
    "( b ) if the initial mass @xmath25 , the core collapses directly to a black hole of mass @xmath26 ( see ref .",
    "thermal neutrinos of @xmath27 mev are also produced in the neutronized core , before it falls into the black hole .",
    "this neutrino luminosity , of order several solar luminosities , may or may not be able to eject ( via absorption in re - energization ) the outer envelope , which is needed in order for it to appear as supernova detectable by its photon emission . as in the case of stars of mass @xmath28 , numerical simulations have not yet been able to prove whether stars in this mass range eject their envelope ; and , observationally , it is unclear whether any observed supernova can be ascribed to progenitors in this mass range .",
    "however , stars more massive than @xmath16 are certainly observed , and from well understood physics , they must core - collapse to a black hole .",
    "this is the gist of what happens to stars of mass @xmath29 if the stellar core is rotating slowly .",
    "a black hole , and possibly a temporary small accretion disk is formed after core collapse , which may not greatly affect the symmetry of the collapse and/or envelope ejection .",
    "the situation is thought to be drastically different for stars in the range @xmath30 whose core is fast - rotating.@xcite in particular , for a core angular momentum in the range ( 3 - 20)@xmath31 @xmath32 s@xmath33 for this model , the black hole and disk accretion can serve as an energy source for powering a long grb , and may be able to eject a stellar envelope with kinetic energies possibly 10 - 100 times higher ( at least in an isotropic - equivalent sense ) than the energy of typical type ib / c or type ii sne .",
    "fast core rotation also helps in forming low density channels along the rotation axis , by centrifugal evacuation .",
    "part of the material accreting from the disc onto the black hole can then be ejected as narrow jets along the axes , collimated by the gas pressure of the envelope .",
    "the jets are powered by neutrino annihilation or magnetohydrodynamic stresses .",
    "the pressure and energy deposition from the jet helps eject the star s envelope and thus the sn explosion happens . in the case of a highly relativistic jet which manages to break through the stellar envelope , the grb event takes place outside the star in an optically thin environment . a slow jet , which is modelled in the next section ,",
    "may never break through , but the ejected material can give rise to an `` orphan '' radio afterglow which is not associated with @xmath5-ray emission .",
    "however , non - thermal high energy ( @xmath34 tev ) neutrinos are produced ubiquitously in both cases .",
