    "then evaluated using the parameter set ( [ eq : parameters ] ) .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the first ( hoava ) mode , the dashed line corresponds to the new degree .",
    "the dotted line is the absolute value of the frequency of the second mode.,width=366 ]    it seems likely that one could actually fine  tune the parameters of the theory so as to make the sign flip in the kinetic term exactly coincide with the one in the frequency and avoid any instability at any momenta .",
    "the complexity of the full dispersion relations in the diagonal basis makes it particularly challenging to find such a tuning in practice .",
    "however , it is hard to imagine how it would be radiatively stable even if it exists .",
    "we now reexamine the results of the previous sections by assuming further restrictions in the theory .",
    "the issues associated with the unstable extra degree stem from the terms with coefficients @xmath161 , i.e those that contain time derivatives of the acceleration vector , which render the lapse dynamical . on the other hand , the projectability condition @xcite constrains the lapse to be a function of time only . hence ,",
    "if one imposes this condition the offending terms will trivially vanish . in this restricted theory",
    "the lapse can be fixed by using the ( space - independent ) time reparametrization symmetry .",
    "imposing projectability affects only the scalar sector and the results in the previous section remain the same for the tensor and vector modes .",
    "thus , the stability conditions for the tensor modes are still given by eq .   and",
    "the vector modes still acquire contributions from mixed derivative terms that improve the uv behavior .",
    "the effect on the scalar sector is far more dramatic , as the projectability condition actually removes the second scalar mode .",
    "the coefficient of the kinetic term for the remaining scalar graviton is @xmath162\\kappa^2+\\left[2\\left(\\gamma_1+\\gamma_2\\right)+\\gamma_4\\right]^2\\kappa^4}{\\lambda-1-\\left(\\gamma_1+\\gamma_2+\\gamma_3+\\gamma_4\\right)\\kappa^2}\\ , , \\label{eq : projkin}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while the dispersion relation is given by @xmath163}{\\bar{k}_{s , p}}\\ , .",

    "\\label{eq : irproj}\\ ] ] requiring positivity of the kinetic term s coefficient in this limit yields : @xmath167 combining the above with the conditions from the tensor sector , we see that the sound speed for the scalar mode is imaginary , leading to a gradient type instability .",
    "this is the well - known result of hoava gravity with projectability condition @xcite .    in standard hoava gravity , this ir gradient instability is accompanied by strong coupling in the limit @xmath168 @xcite .",
    "this behavior emanates from the kinetic part of the action ; the solution of the momentum constraint yields a shift vector with longitudinal component @xmath169 . as the perturbative expansion of the action contains arbitrary powers of @xmath136 , upon canonical normalization , terms of higher order acquire coefficients with increasing powers of the factor @xmath170 .",
    "thus , if in the ir @xmath171 runs to sufficiently small values from above , the perturbative expansion that led to the conclusion that there is an instability actually breaks down .",
    "this leaves open the possibility to have a non - perturbative restoration of the gr limit .",
    "indeed , there are indications that @xmath168 limit is continuously connected to gr for spherically symmetric configurations @xcite and for cosmological solutions @xcite .    on the other hand , in the mixed derivative extension of projectable hoava gravity , the scalar sector is modified .",
    "although the gradient instability persists , the @xmath168 limit can still be perturbative . to be precise",
    ", the solution of the momentum constraint now gives ( in the gauge @xmath172 ) @xmath173 thus the longitudinal component of the shift vector no longer diverges in this limit . as a result ,",
    "the strong coupling argument for projectable hoava gravity does not apply to the mixed derivative extension and there is no indication that the perturbative expansion breaks down .",
    "however , the potential absence of strong coupling is not necessarily a blessing as the gradient instability at low momenta can no longer be screened .",
    "a further implication of the finite @xmath168 limit arises in the dispersion relation for the hoava scalar . in the original theory ,",
    "the scalar dispersion relation is @xmath174 thus vanishes in this limit .",
    "on the other hand , the mixed derivative extension provides a finite contribution to the next to leading order term in : @xmath175\\,,\\ ] ] giving rise to a @xmath176 dispersion relation in the ir .",
    "coupling matter to gravity is an important challenge in lorentz violating gravity theories . in particular , the main concern is to find a way to to avoid large lorentz violating corrections to the matter sector , where lorentz symmetry is extremely well constrained @xcite .",
    "a mechanism which relies on separation of scales to suppress the lorentz violating corrections was proposed in ref .",
    "however , adapting this mechanism to hoava gravity introduces a technical naturalness problem in that the vector graviton loops diverge quadratically .",
    "it has been suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that adding one specific mixed derivative term could resolve this problem .",
    "mixed - derivative terms were studied in more generality in refs .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that theories with mixed derivative terms exhibit a modified scaling anisotropy and in ref .",
    "@xcite a tower of power - counting renormalizable , unitary lifshitz ",
    "type theories were introduced .    in this paper",
    ", we applied the insights of ref .",
    "@xcite to gravity and introduced the minimal mixed - derivative extension of hoava gravity , which includes all possible terms that are allowed by the new scaling and contribute to the quadratic action in perturbations around flat space .",
    "the perturbative analysis of this more general version of the theory uncovered an instability , the nature of which depends on the choice of parameters . in general , instead of the single scalar graviton appearing in hoava gravity ( and in the restricted mixed derivative theory of refs .",
    "@xcite ) , there are actually two propagating scalar degrees of freedom . in the ir ,",
    "the new scalar degree of freedom turns out to be either a tachyon or a ghost , _",
    "i.e. _  it has either imaginary mass or negative kinetic energy .    in the former case",
    ", the mode exhibits an exponential growth with a time scale @xmath177 where @xmath150 is the characteristic scale that suppresses higher order operators in hoava gravity , @xmath152 is one of the parameters of the ir part of the actions , currently constrained to about 1 part in @xmath178 by weak field constraints @xcite , and @xmath114 is the coefficient of one of the terms that appear in the mixed derivative extension . attempting to render",
    "the instability inefficient would require very large values of @xmath114 .",
    "if instead the new scalar degree of freedom is a ghost , effective field theory wisdom suggests that its mass can be made to be heavy enough such that the instability is never reached within the regime of validity of the ir approximation .",
    "however , unlike most effective field theory treatments , we know that here the ghost is not a byproduct of the truncation and that this degree of freedom continues to propagate in the uv completion .",
    "our analysis suggests that one can not have a transition from a heavy ghost to healthy mode without fine  tuning .",
    "one way to avoid the unwanted scalar degree of freedom is to adopt the projectability condition of hoava gravity . in this case",
    "the offending terms would be automatically excluded due to the restrictions in the field content ( @xmath179 ) .",
    "however , in this case the known scalar degree of freedom is itself either a ghost or classically unstable , just as in the version without mixed derivative terms .",
    "remarkably though , a preliminary analysis suggest that the mixed derivative terms remove strong coupling and make the projectable theory perturbative in the @xmath180 limit .",
    "our results imply that adding mixed - derivative terms in order to address the naturalness problem found in ref .",
    "@xcite has serious shortcomings .",
    "the mixed - derivative extension appears to be the only resolution without increasing the field content of the theory and so long as @xmath5  symmetry is preserved .",
    "an alternative would be to relax this symmetry in a way that allows the vector modes to be dynamical .",
    "this is an interesting direction that will be explored in future work .",
    "the work of a.e.g . is supported by stfc grant st / l00044x/1 . the research leading to these results has received funding from the european research council under the european union s seventh framework programme ( fp7/2007 - 2013 ) / erc grant agreement n. 306425 `` challenging general relativity '' .",
    "in this appendix , we show that hoava gravity with generic @xmath32 leads to the same linear equations for vector modes as gr .",
    "we start by considering linear vector perturbations around a minkowski background @xmath181 where scalar and tensor perturbations are ignored for the present discussion",
    ". under infinitesimal transformation of spatial coordinates @xmath182 , we have @xmath183 i.e. this combination involving transverse vectors is invariant . in fact , this is the only gauge invariant combination ( up to a factor ) one can construct out of vector fields .",
    "for this reason , any term in the action contributing only to one of @xmath84 or @xmath85 is expected to vanish at quadratic order . as an example , let us consider the spatial curvature tensor , which clearly does not depend on the shift vector ( and hence its perturbation @xmath84 ) , @xmath184 \\nonumber\\\\&+ \\mathcal{o}({\\rm perturbations}^2)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the decomposition , it is immediate that the dependence on the transverse vector @xmath85 drops out at linear order in perturbations . thus , we infer that any term in the action which contains two powers of the ricci tensor will not contribute to the vector propagator .",
    "similarly , the quantities @xmath44 and @xmath185 contain only scalar perturbations at linear order .",
    "terms that mix these quantities with @xmath43 will not contribute to the vector propagator due to 3d rotational symmetry of the minkowski background .",
    "thus , any term in the action that can potentially modify the vector propagator should contain both @xmath84 and @xmath85 in the specific combination .",
    "the only such terms are the ones that involve lie derivatives along the normal vector , e.g. the extrinsic curvature : @xmath186 where we only considered contributions to the vector sector .",
    "notice that the trace of this quantity @xmath102 , does not contribute to the quadratic vector action either .",
    "thus we have shown that in the action , only the @xmath187 term contributes to the vector modes , independent of the number of spatial derivatives introduced by the @xmath39 term .",
    "if one insists on the symmetry and the field content @xmath67 , @xmath14 and @xmath188 , then there are only two ways to modify the quadratic action for vector modes with respect to gr : _ i.  _ to include higher powers of @xmath38 ; _ ii .",
    "_ to include terms quadratic in @xmath38 , but with spatial derivatives . clearly , the former option involves more than two time derivatives and this is a threat for unitarity , so the only viable option is the latter one .",
    "in this appendix , we show that including the terms @xmath58 and @xmath59 in @xmath60 would be redundant as , at quadratic order in perturbations around minkowski space time , their contribution is no different than that of the @xmath189 terms .    in the action ( [ eq : mixedaction ] ) , @xmath190 is always combined with @xmath38 whose leading order term is already linear in perturbations .",
    "therefore , only the linear order term for @xmath190 contributes to the action quadratic in perturbations . from eq .",
