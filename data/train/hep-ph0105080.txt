    "<S> current solar , atmospheric , and reactor neutrino data still allow oscillation scenarios where the squared mass differences are all close to @xmath0 ev@xmath1 , rather than being hierarchically separated . for solar neutrinos , </S>",
    "<S> this situation ( realized in the upper part of the so - called large - mixing angle solution ) implies adiabatic transitions which depend weakly on the neutrino energy and on the matter density , as well as on the `` atmospheric '' squared mass difference . </S>",
    "<S> in such a regime of `` quasi - energy - independent '' ( qei ) transitions , intermediate between the more familiar `` mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein '' ( msw ) and energy - independent ( ei ) regimes , we first perform analytical calculations of the solar @xmath2 survival probability at first order in the matter density , beyond the usual hierarchical approximations . </S>",
    "<S> we then provide accurate , generalized expressions for the solar neutrino mixing angles in matter , which reduce to those valid in the msw , qei and ei regimes in appropriate limits . </S>",
    "<S> finally , a representative qei scenario is discussed in some detail . </S>"
