    ". termed `` relaxors , '' each exhibits an unusual dielectric response that peaks broadly at a temperature @xmath10 that is strongly frequency dependent ( @xmath11  k at 1 khz for pmn ) . when doped with ferroelectric pbtio@xmath2 ( pt ) , both compounds exhibit dramatic increases in their already exceptional piezoelectric properties .",
    "@xcite each compound is characterized by quenched chemical disorder on the perovskite b - site by mg@xmath12 ( or zn@xmath12 ) and nb@xmath13 cations .",
    "@xcite it is well known that the mixed valence character inherent to both pmn and pzn is required for the dielectric relaxation and `` diffuse transition '' in a temperature range around @xmath14 . despite these similarities , pmn and pzn are surprisingly different . whereas pzn is a ferroelectric that transforms from a cubic to a rhombohedral phase at 410  k ,  @xcite pmn remains , on average , cubic below @xmath14 down to 5  k ,  @xcite to date",
    "the true ground state of pmn remains an enigma .",
    "neutron measurements of the lattice dynamics and diffuse scattering in these relaxor systems have proven to be invaluable in the effort to solve the relaxor problem . pioneering work by vakhrushev _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite yielded critical information about the diffuse scattering and low - frequency transverse optic ( to ) phonons in pmn at high temperatures .",
    "recent neutron inelastic scattering measurements on pzn and pzn doped with pt in the cubic phase have revealed an anomalous damping of the to phonons that only occurs at reduced wave vectors @xmath15 less than a characteristic value @xmath16  @xmath17 , which gives rise to the so - called `` waterfall '' feature .",
    "@xcite the origin of this damping was speculated to result from the presence of local regions of randomly - oriented polarization that couple strongly to the polar nature of to modes .",
    "these small regions of polarization , also known as polar nanoregions or pnr , were first inferred in 1983 by burns and dacol from measurements of the optic index of refraction in different relaxor systems , including pmn and pzn .",
    "@xcite the most remarkable aspect of their finding was that the pnr start forming at a temperature @xmath9 , also known as the burns temperature , that is several hundred degrees higher than @xmath18 ( or @xmath19 ) .",
    "gehring _ et al .",
    "_ demonstrated that at temperatures above @xmath9 , where there are no pnr , the low-@xmath15 to modes in pmn exhibit a normal optic phonon dispersion , and are not overdamped .",
    "@xcite this provides the first direct evidence of the correlation between the pnr and the anomalous phonon damping .",
    "subsequently , hirota _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a simple model that resolves the puzzling diffuse scattering problem in pmn by introducing the concept of a `` phase - shifted condensed soft mode . ''",
    "recent improvements in crystal growth have made such measurements possible using larger crystals . from these experimental facts , we know that the pnr are directly connected with the soft zone center to mode .    in this paper",
    "we extend our previous phonon research down to 10  k using a large high quality single crystal of pmn , the same as that used in ref .",
    "our results clearly show the recovery of the to mode at 220  k in addition to two distinct phonon anomalies which provide definitive evidence of ferroelectric ordering in pmn , and thus sheds new light on the ground state of pmn .",
    "neutron - scattering experiments were performed on the c5 triple - axis spectrometer located in the nru reactor at chalk river laboratories .",
    "inelastic measurements were carried out by holding the momentum transfer @xmath20 constant , while scanning the energy transfer @xmath21 by fixing the final neutron energy @xmath22 at 14.6  mev and varying the incident energy @xmath23 .",
    "horizontal beam collimations from reactor to detector were 32@xmath24 - 32@xmath24-s-48@xmath24 - 60@xmath24 ( s = sample ) .",
    "highly - oriented pyrolytic graphite ( hopg ) ( 002 ) crystals were used as monochromator , analyzer , and higher - order filter . a 3.25  g ( @xmath25  cc ) single crystal of pmn was prepared by a top - seeded solution growth technique from pbo flux . the crystal was mounted in either a high - temperature furnace or a closed - cycle helium refrigerator such that reflections of the form @xmath26 lay in the scattering plane .",
    "the room temperature lattice parameter of pmn is @xmath27   ,  so that 1 reciprocal lattice unit ( r.l.u . )",
    "@xmath28  @xmath17 .",
    "one of the most important findings of the present study is the recovery of the soft mode at low temperature .",
    "as shown in a previous neutron scattering study , this mode becomes overdamped at @xmath9 when the pnr first condense .",
    "@xcite the recovery of the to branch is summarized in fig .",
    "1(a ) together with the to branch at 1100  k from ref .",
    "circles and squares represent the phonon energies at 500  k and 150  k , respectively . while the to modes are overdamped or heavily damped for @xmath29  r.l.u . at 500  k",
    ", these modes are underdamped at 150  k , and exhibit a normal to dispersion .",
    "phonon profiles at ( 2 , 0 , 0.08 ) ( @xmath30 ) are shown at three different temperatures in fig .",
    "1(b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) .",
    "it is clear that the to mode is nearly overdamped at 500  k , strongly damped at 290  k , but has recovered an underdamped character at 150  k.    = 2.8 in    figure 2(a ) summarizes the temperature dependence of the ta linewidth @xmath31 at ( 2 , 0 , 0.2 ) , which begins to broaden significantly near @xmath9 , and is in good agreement with the results of naberezhnov _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite and koo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite upon further cooling we obtain the new result that the broadening peaks around 400  k and decreases until it finally disappears around 220  k. similar results are observed at @xmath32 and 0.16  r.l.u .",
    ", however the broadening at @xmath33  r.l.u .  was studied in more detail since the effect is most prominent there .",
    "examples of ta phonon profiles at ( 2 , 0 , 0.2 ) are shown in the three right - hand panels of fig .",
    "3 . clearly",
    "the ta phonon linewidth at 500  k is larger than it is at either 150 or 750  k. it is quite interesting to note that the temperature at which the broadening vanishes ( 220  k ) is very close to the temperature at which pmn becomes ferroelectric ( @xmath34  k ) when cooled in the presence of a sufficiently large electric field @xmath35 .",
    "@xcite    = 3.4 in    fig .",
    "2(b ) combines the temperature dependence of the zone center to phonon energy squared ( @xmath36)@xmath37 measured at ( 2 , 0 , 0 ) at low temperatures with that reported at high temperatures by gehring _ et al . _",
    "@xcite when compared with fig .",
    "2(a ) a truly striking picture emerges .",
    "as indicated by the dashed vertical lines passing through both panels ( a ) and ( b ) , the onset of the ta phonon broadening near @xmath9 coincides with the temperature at which the zone center mode becomes overdamped . on the low temperature side , the to mode reappears around 220  k , which is effectively the same temperature ( @xmath38 ) at which the ta broadening vanishes .",
    "thus these data show that the lattice dynamics of pmn are intimately connected with the condensation of the pnr at @xmath9 as well as with the ferroelectric transition temperature @xmath19 ( for @xmath35 ) .    at high temperatures ( @xmath39 ) , the zone center",
    "to mode has been shown to soften in a manner consistent with that of a ferroelectric soft mode .",
    "@xcite it was not possible to determine the energy @xmath36 of the zone center mode over a wide range of temperatures below @xmath9 due to its overdamped nature ( see fig .",
    "3(b ) ) . at temperatures below 220  k",
    ", however , the to mode is no longer overdamped , and the phonon profiles could be fit to a lorentzian function of @xmath15 and @xmath40 convolved with the instrumental resolution function . from these fits",
    "we have established that ( @xmath36)@xmath6 increases linearly with decreasing temperature .",
    "this is a seminal point since , in a normal ferroelectric material , the linear relationship between ( @xmath36)@xmath6 and the inverse dielectric constant @xmath41 is well established above and below @xmath19 .",
    "@xcite it should also be noted that @xmath7 reaches 11  mev at 10  k , a value identical to that for ferroelectric pzn at low temperature .",
    "@xcite this suggests a ferroelectric state is eventually established in pmn too .",
    "this point will be discussed in detail later .",
    "= 2.7 in    the three left - hand panels of fig",
    ".  3 trace the evolution of the zone center to mode at ( 2 , 0 , 0 ) .",
    "we observe a well - defined propagating mode at 1100  k , but a subsequently overdamped mode at 500  k , which then completely recovers an underdamped character at 50  k. the dramatic recovery of the soft mode below 220  k occurs relatively quickly with decreasing temperature . by comparison ,",
    "the recovery of the underdamped soft mode in pzn is slower , as it is readily observed only at temperatures below @xmath42  k.  @xcite the quick recovery in pmn is also clearly demonstrated in fig .",
    "4(a ) , which shows the temperature dependence of the soft mode linewidth @xmath31 . below @xmath19 @xmath31 decreases quickly , and becomes very small at low temperature .",
    "in fig .  2 we demonstrate the occurence of two distinct phonon anomalies in pmn near 220  k. the most remarkable of these is the linear increase of the square of the soft mode energy that begins below 220  k. this behavior is typical of many ferroelectrics in their ordered states . yet pmn is known to retain an average cubic structure through 220  k , and even down to very low temperature .  @xcite the soft mode behavior shown in fig .  2 appears to contradict the currently accepted picture of pmn because it implies that a phase transition takes place from a relaxor state to a short - range ordered ferroelectric ( non - cubic ) state at @xmath19 .",
    "relaxor - to - ferroelectric phase transitions have been observed in other lead - oxide compounds such as chemically disordered pb(sc@xmath43ta@xmath43)o@xmath2 ( pst )  @xcite and pb(sc@xmath43nb@xmath43)o@xmath2 ( psn ) .",
    "@xcite they usually occur at a temperature @xmath19 that is lower than the temperature of the maximum permittivity @xmath14 .",
    "the difference between @xmath18 ( at 1  khz ) and @xmath19 is about 15 degrees in pst and psn , and is significantly smaller than that observed in pmn ( @xmath44  k ) .",
    "in addition , both pst and psn have relatively sharp dielectric permittivity @xmath45 peaks ( small diffuse character ) compared to that in pmn .",
    "the only data on pmn that shows an anomaly at @xmath46  k upon zfc is the peak in the hypersonic damping shown in fig .",
    "@xcite it has also been reported that a macroscopic ferroelectric phase can be induced in pmn upon cooling in a small electric field , and that once induced , the ferroelectric phase and the related polarization vanish upon zero - field - heating as a first - order transition at @xmath47  k.  @xcite these results suggest that pmn may exhibit a ferroelectric phase , which , however , does not achieve long - range order when zero - field cooled . therefore , the soft mode behavior reported here is not entirely unexpected .",
    "it does , however , reveal the ferroelectric phase transition near @xmath19 in terms of the dynamics for the first time .",
    "there remains the question of why a sharp structural phase transition is not observed in pmn by x - rays , even though a ferroelectric phase is implied from the low - temperature lattice dynamics .",
    "one possible answer concerns the length scale of the rhombohedral ferroelectric phase .",
    "quite simply , a length scale of order @xmath48    will appear as long - range order to neutrons but as short - range order to x - rays .",
    "in fact , ferroelectric regions of order 100    in size have been reported by de mathan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite    pmn is a special relaxor compound given its unusually broad dielectric relaxation , and the large temperature difference between @xmath14 and @xmath19 .",
    "we believe that an important clue to understanding the low temperature properties of pmn lies in the concept of the phase - shifted condensed soft mode recently proposed by hirota _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in this work the pnr are shown to result from the condensation of the soft to mode at @xmath9 through a model that reconciles the differences between the structure factors of the soft mode and the diffuse scattering by introducing a uniform ionic shift of the pnr along their polar axis relative to the surrounding cubic matrix .",
    "this phase shift persists to low temperatures as shown by the structural work of de mathan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite it is important to note that the relative intensities of the diffuse lines reported by de mathan _ et al . _",
    "are in excellent agreement with the phase - shifted condensed soft mode results of hirota _ et al . _",
    "the uniform phase shift idea provides an additional energy barrier to the formation of a long - range ordered ferroelectric state .",
    "we speculate that the combination of this energy barrier and the random field effects introduced by the pnr prevent pmn from entering into a pure ferroelectric state .",
    "finally , we discuss the relationship between @xmath49 and @xmath50 . in fig .",
    "2(b ) , the dashed line is drawn so that @xmath49 has a minimum at @xmath51  k , where the ta phonon linewidth is largest . since @xmath49 is linearly related to @xmath50 , one might guess that the minimum value of @xmath49 would occur at @xmath52  k. however , this value of @xmath53 is obtained at a measuring frequency of 1  khz . by comparison ,",
    "@xmath54  k at a measuring frequency of 100  mhz .",
    "our neutron measurements probe the dynamical response function of pmn at frequencies on the order of thz .",
    "since @xmath53 is by definition strongly frequency dependent in relaxors , the temperature of 400  k may possibly correspond to @xmath53 on the thz scale .    to understand the relaxor - to - ferroelectric phase transition in pmn ( and thos in other relaxors ) , we intend to carry out a series of neutron experiments which includes a systematic comparison of the lattice dynamics in pmn , pmn-@xmath55pt , psn and pzn .",
    "these experiments will provide useful information about the microscopic mechanism of relaxor ferroelectricity .",
    "recent studies  @xcite of pmn-@xmath55pt have already documented very interesting changes in the phase transition with increasing pbtio@xmath2 content @xmath55 .",
