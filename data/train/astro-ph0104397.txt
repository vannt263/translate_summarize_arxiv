    "equation  [ eqn - caustic ] automatically excludes these outliers from the caustic mass determination .",

    "the virial mass decreases by a factor of two or more , even at large radius , when we include only those galaxies which lie inside the caustics . for comparison , we plot @xmath95 for three different values of the smoothing parameter ; the caustic mass is much more robust .",

    "we adopt this value of @xmath111 and compute the virial surface term .",
    "the overall trend of the surface term is decreasing with radius .",

    "we thus transform to _",
    "r _ and _ v _ using the @xmath195 colors above along with @xmath196 for early - type galaxies and @xmath197 .",
    "the mass - to - light ratios within 1.5 @xmath28 mpc are then equivalent to : @xmath198 @xmath199 @xmath200 @xmath201    the caustic mass - to - light ratio is consistent with most previous measurements of cluster @xmath18 ratios ; typical values using virial masses are @xmath202 @xcite , with a range of @xmath203 @xcite .",
    "our virial @xmath18 determination is consistent with the high end of this range .",
    "estimates of @xmath18 using x - ray masses tend to be somewhat lower .",
    "@xcite find @xmath204 solar units for seven nearby abell clusters and one group , and _ rosat _ observations of eleven groups and clusters yield @xmath205 @xcite .",
    "we discuss a large , deep imaging survey of a galaxy cluster in the near - infrared , covering a 1.35 deg@xmath2 ( 9 @xmath176 mpc@xmath2 ) region of a1644 .",
    "these data allow us to determine the ir lf at _ h _ to roughly @xmath206 , deeper than most previous infrared surveys of comparable size .",
    "we also acquired spectra for 155 galaxies ( including @xmath207 cluster members ) and use these to compute @xmath187 for the cluster .",
    "the results are :    1 .",
    "a grouping of cluster members by spectral type reveals evidence at the 96 - 97% confidence level for the segregation of emission and absorption galaxies by both velocity and core radius . although only marginally statistically significant , these detections of segregation with respect to spectral type are in the same direction as the morphological segregation observed in other clusters @xcite .",
    "in contrast with an earlier analysis by @xcite , there is no significant evidence for substructure on any scale .",
    "our 50% larger sample of cluster members is responsible for the difference .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the cluster varies little with radius for @xmath208 mpc . near the center",
    ", @xmath69 is slightly larger than at the periphery , provided that we exclude three high - velocity galaxies at large clustercentric distance which may be background .",
    "the luminosity distribution is well - fit by a schechter function with @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "these parameters agree with previous infrared lf measurements of clusters and field galaxies .",
    "in particular , an _ h_-band determination of the coma lf @xcite yields an identical slope and characteristic magnitude to within the errors .",
    "the shape of the a1644 lf is consistent with several infrared cluster lfs @xcite .",
    "however , due to small number statistics and the relatively flat slope of the lf at @xmath168 we are unable to rule out the presence of a dip similar to the ones observed in optical and infrared cluster lfs @xcite .",
    "we compute dynamical masses of a1644 based on the virial theorem and on the use of caustics .",
    "the caustic technique yields masses which have smaller errors , are more robust , and agree better with x - ray data .",
    "these masses , combined with the _ h_-band photometry , yield an @xmath22 within @xmath209 mpc .",
    "this mass - to - light ratio is one of the first determinations in the infrared , and corresponds to @xmath210 at visible wavelengths . that the infrared @xmath18 agrees with previous optical determinations suggests that in some clusters biases by factors such as dust and short - lived star formation events are a small effect compared with the errors in the determination of mass - to - light ratios .",
    "we thank the staff members of flwo and ctio for assistance with our observations . in particular , mercedes gmez assisted with the observations at ctio , and the remote observers at whipple observatory obtained all of the redshifts listed in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "we are grateful to susan tokarz for reducing the fast spectra .",
    "we also thank the referee for comments which increased the clarity of the paper .",
