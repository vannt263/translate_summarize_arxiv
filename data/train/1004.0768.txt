    "spin - orbit interaction is the primary source of spin relaxation for free carriers in semiconductors.@xcite at the same time , it offers the potential to control the spin orientation of those carriers without the need for conventional high frequency resonance techniques.@xcite controlling carrier spins using spin - orbit interaction requires the ability to tune its effect with external parameters such as a magnetic field or voltages on electrostatic gates . in the datta - das spin transistor concept , for example",

    "recent experiments have shown that bouncing trajectories in gate - defined channels of high mobility gaas two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) , in an external magnetic field , lead to rapid spin relaxation through a process we refer to as ballistic spin resonance ( bsr).@xcite on resonance the effect of spin - orbit interaction is amplified by matching the bouncing frequency to the larmor precession frequency , and the bouncing frequency depends on the gate - defined channel width . although the mechanism of bsr is straightforward , it is not obvious that the effect should be visible for realistic parameters in a practical device .    in this report , semi - classical monte carlo simulations of spin dynamics are used to test the resilience of bsr over a wide range of device parameters .",
    "the simulation models varying degrees and types of disorder , confinement potential from the electrostatic gates , and lack of perfect specularity on scattering off the channel walls .",
    "we restrict our attention to electron - doped gaas 2degs at low temperature , where the dyakonov - perel mechanism has been shown to be the dominant source of spin relaxation.@xcite a range of spin - orbit interaction strengths are explored in the simulation , including linear rashba and dresselhaus terms as well as the cubic dresselhaus term .",
    "bsr is found to be robust over a wide range of experimentally - accessible parameters , and not to depend sensitively on specific model of disorder .",
    "at the most general level , spin - orbit interaction couples an electron s spin degree of freedom to its momentum .",
    "spin - orbit interaction in iii - v semiconductor quantum wells is characterized by rashba ( @xmath0 ) and dresselhaus ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) terms , due respectively to structural and bulk crystal inversion asymmetry.@xcite including both types of spin - orbit interaction , the spin - orbit hamiltonian is : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the component of the fermi wavevector along the [ 100 ] crystal axis , @xmath5 is the pauli spin operator along the [ 100 ] axis .",
    "we note that the sign convention adopted for this hamiltonian gives @xmath6 .",

    "@xmath11 can be interpreted in terms of a momentum - dependent effective zeeman field , @xmath12 , which takes the following form when expressed along @xmath9- and @xmath10-axes : @xmath13 this effective field corresponds to a spin - orbit precession time @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the land g - factor in gaas .",
    "spin precession according to @xmath11 is coherent from a microscopic point of view . at a practical level , however , this term gives rise to spin relaxation in any real conductor due to momentum scattering .",
    "electron spins precess around an effective magnetic field that changes , as the momentum changes , at each scattering event .",
    "an ensemble of polarized spins , initially oriented in the same direction but following different random trajectories , will be distributed randomly around the bloch sphere after a relaxation time , @xmath16 .",
    "this relaxation process is known as the dyakonov - perel ( dp ) mechanism.@xcite    external magnetic fields have a strong effect on dp relaxation .",
    "these effects can be quite complicated when both orbital and spin effects are included . in this paper",
    "we discuss only the case of in - plane magnetic fields , which give rise to zeeman splitting but not to landau quantization or cyclotron motion .",
    "when @xmath12 is added to an in - plane magnetic field @xmath17 , it is the total effective field @xmath18 that sets the spin precession axis and precession time for dp spin dynamics .",

    "@xcite it is the goal of this work to study @xmath22 numerically in these cases .",
    "semi - classical monte carlo simulations of dp spin dynamics in a 2deg channel were performed by calculating momentum - dependent spin precession along an ensemble of randomly - generated classical trajectories , @xmath23 , analogous to the calculations described in refs .  .",

    "the range of spin - orbit parameters and mean free paths explored in this work represent a broader range than would commonly be encountered in a transport experiment .",
    "the channels were assumed to be infinitely long , and each trajectory started from the middle of the wire with a random initial velocity direction .",

    "the semiclassical approximation used in this simulation ",
    "classical trajectories with coherent spin precession  is valid when both the orbital phase coherence time and the momentum scattering time are shorter than the spin relaxation time , and when electron trajectories can be assumed to be independent of spin direction .",
    "the latter criterion implies that the fermi energy is much larger than the spin - orbit energy @xmath11 .",
    "this is a valid approximation in _ n_-type gaas quantum wells but not in _ p_-type samples or narrow - gap semiconductors.@xcite",

    "electrons bounce off the channel walls many times before their momentum is randomized , because the mean free path is much larger than the channel width and scattering from the walls is specular .",
    "the trajectories in such a system are characterized by rapid , nearly - periodic changes in the sign of the momentum transverse to the channel , @xmath39 , while the magnitude of the longitudinal momentum , @xmath40 , changes only diffusively over a longer timescale .",

    ".    relaxation of spins that are aligned initially along @xmath17 results from fluctuating fields transverse to @xmath17 . in the dp mechanism ,",
    "those transverse fields are the momentum - dependent effective fields arising from spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the first - order component of the effective magnetic field due to @xmath39 is always in the @xmath9-direction ( eq .  ( [ eq : bso ] ) ) , independent of the relative strength of rashba and dresselhaus terms in the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "similarly , the effective field due to @xmath40 is always in the @xmath10-direction .",
    "hence spins in an external field along @xmath46 relax due to fluctuations in the motion along @xmath46 ; spins in a field along @xmath47 relax due to fluctuations in the motion along @xmath47 .",
    "the qualitatively different power spectral densities of the two momentum components , @xmath48 and @xmath42 ( fig .",

    "the sharp periodic dips in @xmath52 are the bsr features that are the subject of this paper : the short relaxation time at these dips is spin resonance due to the peak frequencies in @xmath53 .",
    "this resonance occurs when peaks in @xmath53 occur at the larmor frequency of the external field , @xmath54 .",
    "figure 2(a ) also compares the inverse of the spectral densities of the two momentum components to the spin relaxation times , @xmath22 , extracted from the simulations .",
    "clearly , @xmath55 is directly proportional to @xmath22 when @xmath56 is evaluated at the larmor frequency , @xmath57 .",
    "this is reminiscent of the nuclear spin relaxation time , @xmath58 , for nuclear magnetic resonance , where it has been shown that @xmath59 , with @xmath60 representing the spectral density of fluctuations in the transverse magnetic field , @xmath61 , at the larmor frequency of the static nmr field.@xcite fluctuations in @xmath62 are proportional to @xmath56 by eq .",
    "( 2 ) , and it is these fluctuations that lead to relaxation in the present case . as seen in fig .",
    "2(a ) , the approximation @xmath63 becomes significantly worse when the mean free path is longer than 10@xmath37 m , perhaps because the approximation of exponentially - correlated noise in the nmr result breaks down .",
    "because @xmath52 depends on the @xmath9-component of @xmath12 , it is controlled by @xmath64 and is nearly independent of @xmath65 ( eq .  ) .",
    "the accuracy of this approximation can be tested in the simulation by varying @xmath0 and @xmath1 independently . as seen in fig .",
    "2(b ) , curves with identical @xmath64 but different @xmath65 fall on top of each other for @xmath66 t .",
    "( the stronger dependence on @xmath65 at low field comes about because the direction of @xmath67 fluctuates significantly when @xmath68 . )",

    "2(c ) , holding @xmath69 for all curves : when examined for particular values of magnetic field , the relation @xmath70 expected for 2d ( eq .",
    "( [ dp2d ] ) ) carries over to the channel data ( fig .",

    "the strength of this term is @xmath72 . using values for @xmath2 reported in the literature ( @xmath73)@xcite and 2deg parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 reported in ref .",
    ", the third - order spin - orbit field , @xmath76 , is an order of magnitude smaller than the first - order field , @xmath77 .",
    "for this reason , the simulations presented in most of this paper set @xmath2 explicitly to zero for ease of calculation .    for significantly larger values of @xmath78 or @xmath2 , on the other hand , @xmath76 is of the same order or larger than @xmath77 . because of the more complicated symmetry of @xmath76 , its effect on bsr is not monotonic in @xmath2 .",
    "figure [ gamma ] explores the role of @xmath76 by raising @xmath2 while holding @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath69 .",
    "the bsr dips disappear around @xmath81 , where @xmath82 , but then revive for larger values of @xmath2 .",
    "significant changes in spin relaxation were observed when the overall magnitude of disorder ( set by @xmath83 ) was changed ( fig .",
    "[ mfp ] ) .",
    "when @xmath83 was much smaller than the channel width , resonant dips were absent .",
    "in that case , the bouncing frequency ceases to be a relevant parameter , as electrons seldom make it across the channel without scattering , and the 2d limit of eq .",
    "( [ dp2d ] ) is approached .",
    "the dips become deeper as @xmath83 is increased , but reach a minimum value around @xmath84 m before rising again for even longer mean free paths .    in order to understand this non - monotonic dependence",
    ", we study the @xmath83-dependence of @xmath16 at the first resonant dip , around @xmath85 ( fig .",
    "starting from very short mean free paths , @xmath16 reaches a minimum at @xmath86 , then rises again for very long mean free path .",
    "the length - scale , @xmath87 , corresponds to the distance an electron would have to travel in order for the spin to rotate by @xmath88 due to the spin - orbit effective field .",
    "this behavior can be explained at a qualitative level by considering spin relaxation in a reference frame that rotates at the larmor frequency .",
    "working in this frame effectively removes precession due the external field , _ and _ it removes flips in @xmath12 that occur at frequency @xmath57 due to bouncing between the channel walls . in other words , spin relaxation in the ballistic channel at the bsr condition",
    "is approximately mapped onto spin relaxation in a disordered 2d system at zero external magnetic field . in 2d at zero external field , one expects @xmath89 ( eq .  ( 3 ) ) to decrease with increasing @xmath83 in the motional narrowing regime , i.e.  for fast momentum relaxation , @xmath90 . in the ballistic limit , @xmath91",
    ", on the other hand , one expects @xmath16 to increase with @xmath83 as @xmath92 because spins precess coherently between scattering.@xcite it is the crossover from motional narrowing to ballistic regimes that gives rise to the non - monotonic behavior of @xmath16 in fig .",
    "finally , we show that the particular type of disorder used to generate trajectories , and the type of scattering off channel walls , has only a small effect on the simulated spin relaxation curves .",
    "figure [ disorder ] shows spin relaxation for three different types of disorder :    1 .   _ small - angle scattering_. the direction of motion changed from timestep to timestep by a small angle that was gaussian - distributed around zero , with standard deviation calculated to give the desired mean free path .",
    "this is believed to be the dominant scattering mechanism in high - mobility gaas 2degs.@xcite 2 .",
    "_ large - angle scattering _ was implemented as a probability for complete randomization of momentum angle at each timestep .",
    "the probability was calculated to give the desired mean free path .",
    "3 .   _ rough potential walls _ upon reflection off channel walls ,",
    "the angle of reflection was randomly distributed around the angle of incidence with a spread of @xmath93 .",
    "@xmath94 corresponds to specular scattering from channel walls .",
    "this effect is believed to be weak in electrostatically - defined gaas 2deg nanostructures , as shown by clear transverse focusing signals even up to high order , which require many specular bounces.@xcite    each curve shown in fig .",
    "5(b ) corresponds to disorder from only one of the three mechanisms .",
    "the mean free path is @xmath38 m in each case , confirmed by monitoring the autocorrelation of @xmath95 .",
    "as seen in the figure , the simulated spin relaxation time depends only slightly on the precise model of disorder , despite the importance of ballistic transport to the resonant dips in @xmath52 .",
    "figure 5(b ) also compares bsr for the case of simple reflections from hard - wall channel boundaries to the more realistic case of soft walls , with a 150 nm depletion length as might be expected in nanostructures defined by electrostatic surface gates .",
    "small angle scattering is implemented to give @xmath38 m in both hard - and soft - wall simulations .",
