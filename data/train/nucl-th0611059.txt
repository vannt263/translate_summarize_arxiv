    "various models predict that nuclear ground states in the mass region @xmath3 are characterised by axially deformed shapes . with increase of an angular momentum ,",
    "numerous calculations demonstrate that deformed nuclei undergo a shape transition from axially deformed shape to nonaxial one ( cf ref . ) . such a transition may be manifested as a backbending , known since early seventies @xcite .",

    "for example , we found ( see ref . )",
    "that in @xmath0dy such a transition can be explained as a result of vanishing of the @xmath2-vibrational excitations in the rotating frame , while in @xmath1yb it is due to a rotational alignment of a neutron two - quasiparticle configuration . in the both cases , neither mechanisms do not provide , however , a non ambiguous proof of the onset of triaxial shapes .    nowadays , according to a general notion",
    ", the analysis of specific low - lying excited states near the yrast line could shed light on existence of the nonaxiality . for nonaxial shapes",
    "one expects the appearance of low - lying vibrational states , that may be associated with a classical wobbling motion .",
    "such excitations ( called wobbling excitations ) were suggested first by bohr and mottelson in rotating even - even nuclei @xcite , and analysed soon within a simplified microscopic approach in refs .",
    "( see also ref . and references therein ) .",
    "according to the microscopic approach @xcite , the wobbling excitations are vibrational states of the negative signature built on the positive signature yrast ( vacuum ) state .",
    "their characteristic feature is collective e2 transitions with @xmath5 between these and yrast states .",
    "first experimental evidence of such states in odd lu nuclei was reported only recently @xcite .",
    "properties of the wobbling excitations at different angular momenta may be studied within the asymmetric rotor model ( arm ) @xcite ( see also appendix ) .",
    "the extension of this model for odd nuclei has been used recently for the analysis @xcite of experimental properties of the second triaxial superdeformed band in @xmath6lu , that carries a few features associated with the wobbling excitations . the classical dispersion equation for the wobbling mode @xcite , with irrotational moments of inertia , was used to describe a spectrum .",
    "the moments of inertia were fitted in order to reproduce the experimental data . as a result ,",
    "a controversial @xmath2-reversed moment of inertia was introduced in ref . to resolve difficulties with the data interpretation . to overcome this problem",
    "the alignment of odd quasiparticle has been taken into account later in ref .. it appears that the approach suggested in refs .",
    "may explain some tendencies , being , however , a crude approximation to a full physical picture of the observed phenomenon .    to explain",
    "the same data in @xmath6lu , a non self - consistent microscopic analysis , based on the cranked nilsson potential , was performed in refs .. as a basic tool , the dispersion equation for wobbling excitations , derived in the time - dependent hartree - bogoliubov approach in ref .",
    ", has been used .",
    "based on the solution of the microscopic equation , in ref .",
    "it was concluded that the pairing correlations do not affect the wobbling excitations , and this should be considered as a specific feature related to this mode . on the other hand",
    ", it was also found that the wobbling excitations are very sensitive to a single - particle alignment .",
    "as it is known , the alignment decreases the pairing correlations .",
    "therefore , the question arises about the validity of this conclusion .",
    "furthermore , the authors admitted that the kinematic moment of inertia @xmath7 was not described properly ( see the discussion in ref . ) .",
    "in addition , the analysis @xcite is based on constant mean field parameters that are not related to the physical minima of the chosen potential at different rotational frequencies .",
    "in fact , the deformation parameters have been taken semi - quantitatively to reproduce roughly experimental data .",
    "this may be not so crucial for the description of strongly deformed nuclei , when the mean field parameters evolve slowly with a variation of the rotational frequency .",
    "however , this approximation becomes questionable for the analysis of the rotational bands in the backbending region , which are the main subject of our paper .",
    "evidently , mean field parameters can change drastically at the backbending ( see , for example , ref . ) .",
    "we recall that wobbling excitations depend on all three moments of inertia that characterize the nonaxial shape .",
    "therefore , a self - consistent microscopic description of the moments of inertia is a necessary requirement to the theory that pretends to provide a solid analysis of experimental data .",
    "recently , we developed a practical method based on the cranked nilsson potential with separable residual interactions for the analysis of the low - lying excitations near the yrast line .",
    "in contrast to previous studies of low - lying excitations at high spins ( cf refs.@xcite ) , we paid a special attention to the self - consistency between the mean field results and a description of low - lying excitations in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",

    "note that a microscopic formulation of the wobbling excitations in the form of the macroscopic rotor model was done by marshalek in the time - dependent hartree - bogoliubov approach for the spherically symmetric , pairing+quadrupole - quadrupole hamiltonian in the principal axes ( pa ) frame @xcite .",
    "following the same approach in the pa frame , shimizu and matsuzaki @xcite analysed the electromagnetic transitions and presented a few numerical examples , using the cranked modified harmonic oscillator ( standard nilsson ) potential . in the standard nillson potential , however , the inertial properties are not described correctly ( see discussion in ref . ) . from point of view of the self - consistency , in order to study the vibrational excitations with this potential , it is appropriate to use the double - stretched quadrupole interaction @xcite .",
    "we will provide a refined microscopic description of the wobbling excitations for doubly - stretched quadrupole interaction and their electromagnetic properties in a time - independent , uniformly rotating ( ur ) frame . in numerical analysis we will pay an attention to the self - consistency between the mean field , vibrational excitations and their electromagnetic properties .",
    "we recall that in the ur frame one considers all negative signature excitations , including the wobbling one . to identify the wobbling excitations in experimental data , a few criteria are proposed in literature , such as : a large collectivity , zig - zag behavior of the b(e2 ) transition probability from a given band into the yrast one with @xmath8 , when one of the transitions is almost dominant @xcite",

    "this enables us to overcome the instability of the rpa calculations at the transition region , at least , for the excitations . in principle",
    ", projection methods may be used in the transition region in order to calculate transition matrix elements . although the amplitudes @xmath96 ( see eq.([phon ] ) ) are higher for the rpa modes in the transition region than in other regions , the relation @xmath290 is still valid to hold the qba .",
    "and least but not last , the crpa becomes quite effective at high spins , after the transition point , when the pairing correlations still persist .    from our analysis",
    "it follows that an excited band can be considered as the wobbling one , if the magnetic transitions from this band into the yrast one fulfil the condition eq.([msr ] ) . note that these rules do not depend on the sign of @xmath2-deformation .",
    "in contrast , the electric quadrupole transitions from this band to the yrast one must fulfil the staggering rules eq.([esr ] ) depending on the sign of @xmath2-deformation .",
    "the transition from this band are characterised by a high collectivity .",
    "we predict that the lowest excited negative signature and positive parity band in @xmath1yb ( which is a natural prolongation of the odd angular momentum part of the @xmath2-band ) transforms to the wobbling band at @xmath291mev .",
    "we found that strong e2 transitions from this band populate the yrast states , with the branching ratio @xmath292 .",
    "such a behaviour is brought about by the onset of nonaxial nuclear shapes with the negative sign of @xmath2-deformation after the backbending . according to our definition of @xmath2-deformation , with the increase of the rotational frequency the system is driving to a noncollective oblate rotation ( around the x - axes ) .",
    "this trend is confirmed by a good agreement between the results for the quadrupole transitions along the yrast line and available experimantal data ( see fig.[fig10 ] ) .",
    "similar transition occurs in @xmath0dy after the backbending as well , at @xmath291mev . in this nucleus",
    "we found that the lowest negative signature and positive parity band represents a natural prolongation of the @xmath2-band with odd spins , observed at small angular momenta up to @xmath293mev . at rotational frequency @xmath294mev this band created by the first rpa solution transforms to the wobbling excitations .",
    "a good agreement between calculated in the crpa and experimental routhians allows us to conclude that the experimental states , associated with @xmath207 band in ref . ,",
    "are wobbling excitations at the rotational frequency values @xmath295mev@xmath296mev .",
    "these states fulfil all requirements that are specific for the wobbling excitations of nonaxially deformed rotating nuclei , with the negative @xmath2-deformation .",
    "evidently , it is quite desirable to obtain new experimental data on electromagnetic decay properties of these states in order to reach a final conclusion about our prediction and , respectively , on the validity of the crpa analysis .",
