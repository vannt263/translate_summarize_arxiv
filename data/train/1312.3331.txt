    "with the recent discovery of the 126 gev scalar particle ( @xmath3 ) at the lhc @xcite , it is naturally appealing to identify it with the long sought - for missing piece of the standard model ( sm ) , the higgs boson .",
    "however , other attractive interpretations of the 126 gev higgs - like state were also considered , one of them being the radion excitation of the metric in randall - sundrum ( rs ) models of a warped extra dimension @xcite with a dynamically stabilized radius , most notably via the goldberger - wise ( gw ) mechanism @xcite .",
    "indeed , in recent years , there has been a growing interest in the radion state due to the fact that it is possibly the lightest new particle in the rs spectrum , and many aspects of its phenomenology have been thoroughly studied @xcite    in the gw mechanism @xcite , a coupled system of gravity and a bulk scalar dynamically generate the finite radius of the extra dimension .",
    "the einstein equations of this system can either be solved directly @xcite or using an effective 4d approach , as in @xcite , while both are usually solved under the assumption of a small backreaction , which greatly simplifies the calculations .",
    "the main difference with pure rs , in which both brane tensions have to be tuned to satisfy the boundary conditions of the einstein equations , is that the size of the extra dimension explicitly enters the equations .",
    "thus , one of the boundary conditions sets the size of the extra dimension and in the process alleviates one of the fine - tunings in the rs1 scenario .",
    "the remaining fine - tuning is that which sets the 4d cosmological constant to zero . in this scenario ,",
    "the radion is the zero - mode of both the scalar metric fluctuation and the bulk scalar ( in the kk - tower of quantum fluctuations to this vacuum ) .",
    "its mass is typically suppressed ( parametrically ) with respect to the kk scale and , thus , it is assumed to be lighter than the rest of the kk spectrum .",
    "the radion has the same quantum number as the sm higgs and it couples to the sm content via the stress - energy tensor @xcite .",
    "it thus has similar decay signatures as the higgs , albeit with different rates .",
    "this fact has raised the question of whether the radion interpretation of the 126 gev discovery is consistent with the lhc data @xcite .",
    "the answer to that seems to be negative : a good fit to the lhc higgs data yields a kk scale of @xmath4 , which is excluded by lhc direct searches @xcite .",
    "the possibility of a mixed higgs - radion state is also excluded when this state is radion - dominated @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present an alternative radius stabilization scenario in which the bulk scalar has the quantum numbers of a 5d @xmath5 bulk - higgs doublet @xcite .",
    "as we will show , the vev of this object can both break the ew symmetry and at the same time play the role of the gw scalar in stabilizing the radius of the extra - dimension .",
    "similar ideas have already appeared in the literature @xcite . in particular , in @xcite a similar setup was investigated both from the ads and cft approaches , using the ads / cft correspondence @xcite,@xmath6}$ ] where it was noted that this scenario is dual to a cft with a marginal deformation by a composite operator @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is an @xmath9 doublet operator.@xmath10}$ ] there are , however , key differences between our setup and the one presented in @xcite , which we will discuss in section ii .",
    "in particular , we try to provide here a coherent account of this scenario from the ads side .",
    "we investigate the stabilization mechanism in this scenario and discuss the level of fine - tuning involved .",
    "we then find the couplings of the lowest scalar excitation of the coupled su(2 ) scalar doublet  gravity system .",
    "more specifically , since this lowest excitation exists both in the metric and in the cp - even component of the bulk doublet , this object has both the standard gravitational couplings of the metric excitation and the yukawa and gauge couplings of the bulk doublet .",
    "we thus denote this mode the  higgs - radion \" , and upon calculating its couplings , we find that the  higgs - radion \" interpretation of the 126 gev scalar is consistent with the lhc data for a kk gluon mass of @xmath11 , which is not excluded by the latest experimental bounds .",
    "in the scenario envisioned here there is a 5d su@xmath12 bulk scalar doublet , potentially with a vev profile along the coordinate @xmath13 of the extra - dimension , within the general context of rsi @xcite . in this section",
    "we derive the solution to the einstein equations of the coupled scalar - gravity system and find a set of boundary conditions for which the ew - planck hierarchy of scales can be generated without any large tuning apart from that which is required by the condition of a vanishing 4d cosmological constant .",
    "the main difference between our scenario and the gw mechanism for radius stabilization is that , both the size of the extra dimension and the mass of the ew gauge bosons depend on the vev profile of our bulk doublet .",
    "in particular , as we will see below , the requirement of @xmath14 masses will lead to a vanishingly small vev on the planck brane , as opposed to the case of the gw scalar @xcite .    as usual ,",
    "the metric is parameterized as : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the metric field which is determined by the einstein equations ( i.e. , @xmath17 for the @xmath18 solution , where @xmath19 is the curvature of the extra dimension ) .",
    "the two branes are located at @xmath20 ( planck brane ) and @xmath21 ( tev brane ) .",
    "similar to the 4d higgs mechanism , we define the 5d vev as @xmath22 the profiles @xmath23 and @xmath24 are then determined by the einstein equations .",
    "we will assume that the backreaction , which is formally defined as @xmath25 later in the text ( see eq . [ backreaction ] ) , is small and solve all equations to the lowest non - vanishing order in @xmath25 , unlike the full solution in @xcite and not using the effective ansatz of @xcite .",
    "we will later see that the assumption of a small backreaction is also required to keep the ew scale lighter than the kk scale .",
    "the bulk and brane actions are given by : @xmath26 where @xmath27 where as usual , @xmath28 and @xmath29 have mass dimensions 1 , 0.5 and -2 , respectively , while @xmath30 has a mass dimension 1.5 .",
    "the einstein equations , @xmath31 , give @xcite : @xmath32 @xmath33 where primes denote @xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",
    "the boundary conditions are then given by matching the delta functions : @xmath37_i=\\frac{\\partial v^{brane}_i(\\phi_0)}{\\partial\\phi_0 } ~ , \\label{const1}\\\\ \\left [ a ' \\right]_i=\\frac{\\kappa^2}{3}v^{brane}_i(\\phi_0 ) \\label{const2}~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is now vital to understand what is the number of integration constants and constraints .",
    "there are two integration constants for @xmath38 , as can be seen by inserting eq .",
    "[ zeroenergy ] into eq .",
    "[ field_eq ] , so that the resulting equation is a second order differential equation .",
    "the first derivative of @xmath16 is then completely determined from eq .",
    "[ zeroenergy ] , with no new integration constants ( the value of @xmath16 does not enter the equations and so it is irrelevant ) .",
    "thus , after setting the integration constants for @xmath38 as discussed above , we are left with two additional boundary conditions ( i.e. , out of the four boundary conditions in eqs .",
    "[ const1 ] and [ const2 ] ) .",
    "one of them will determine the radius of the extra dimension and the remaining one will have to be fine - tuned .",
    "this fine - tuning corresponds to the cosmological constant problem , which in the rs framework appears as the fine - tuning of the planck brane tension . recall",
    "that without the bulk scalar , there are only two boundary conditions and no relevant integration constants so that both of them have to be fine - tuned .    using eq .",
    "[ zeroenergy ] and the boundary conditions for @xmath39 in eq .",
    "[ const1 ] , the two boundary conditions for @xmath40 in eqs .  [ const2 ] can be rewritten as follows : @xmath41 which , as eq .",
    "[ const1 ] , has to be satisfied on each of the two branes .",
    "notice that no derivatives of the vev profile ( i.e. , no @xmath39 ) appear in eq .",
    "[ phi_boundary ] , so that it is simply an equation for the value of @xmath38 on the two branes ( @xmath42 ) , of the form @xmath43 . the natural values for @xmath44",
    "will thus be of the order of the planck scale , which is phenomenologically unacceptable , since the effective 4d vev which sets the ew - scale ( gauge - bosons masses ) is sensitive to its profile ( see eq .  [ veff0 ] ) .",
    "we will return to this apparent problem below .    due to the fact that eq .",
    "[ phi_boundary ] just sets the values of @xmath38 on the two branes , we redefine it to be of the form : @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the solutions to eq .",
    "[ phi_boundary ] for @xmath38 on the tev and planck branes , respectively .",
    "assuming that the backreaction @xmath25 is small so that @xmath48 ( see eq .  [ backreaction ] ) , eq .",
    "[ field_eq ] in the bulk becomes : @xmath49 with the general solution @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the mass of the bulk doublet , as defined in eq .",
    "[ bulkpotential ] .",
    "this is the point where our analysis deviates from the  conventional \" gw mechanism . in particular , if the wave - function of the gauge - boson zero modes is flat , which will turn out to be a good approximation in our case ( see eq .",
    "[ veff ] and discussion thereof ) , then the effective ew vev is given by : @xmath53 which in general gives @xmath54 , unless @xmath55 .",
    "for our solution , assuming no tuning in the values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( so that they are both of @xmath58 ) , the condition of a vanishing @xmath38 on the planck brane ( i.e. , in the sense that @xmath59 ) is obtained when @xmath60 and @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",
    "this is different from the gw mechanism in which @xmath63 @xcite , resulting in an @xmath58 vev on the planck brane ( i.e. , @xmath64 ) .",
    "it is , therefore , clear that the gw mechanism , as it is , can not be applied with an @xmath9 doublet stabilizer . since the gw mechanism can not work with @xmath65",
    ", we adopt a different choice for applying the boundary conditions and for the fine - tuning condition required in order to have a vanishing cosmological constant .",
    "in particular , in the gw mechanism the values of @xmath38 are imposed on both branes ( as in eq .",
    "[ phi_boundary_2 ] ) , while one of the conditions on the derivative of @xmath38 ( eq .",
    "[ const1 ] ) is left to be tuned ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is clearly not a choice we can make , since in choosing @xmath66 , we expect the natural value on the planck brane to be @xmath67 , which is exactly what we are trying to avoid .",
    "we , therefore , use instead the two boundary conditions for the derivatives @xmath39 on both branes ( eq .  [ const1 ] ) and the boundary condition for @xmath38 on the tev brane ( i.e. , @xmath46 in eq .",
    "[ phi_boundary_2 ] ) . as we will shortly see , the remaining fourth condition for @xmath47 in eq .  [ phi_boundary_2 ]",
    "will have the usual fine - tuning associated with the cosmological constant .",
    "nonetheless , the condition @xmath68 which follows from the choice @xmath65 ( see above ) is not in conflict with our choice of boundary conditions and , as is shown below , it does not add to the level of fine - tuning required for the cosmological constant problem . a graphic illustration of the set of boundary conditions in our setup is given in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .     and @xmath39 on the tev and planck branes ( solid line ) . a typical solution of the vev profile in the gw mechanism is also shown ( dashed line ) for comparison ( see also table [ tab0 ] and discussion in the text ) .",
    "_ [ fig1 ] ]    inserting now the solution for @xmath38 ( eq .  [ phi_solution ] ) into the boundary conditions of eqs .  [ const1 ] and [ phi_boundary_2 ] , and ignoring for now the condition @xmath66",

    "[ der_cond ] corresponds to the planck / tev brane , respectively .    in particular , using @xmath72 on the planck brane ( see discussion above )",
    ", we can neglect the cubic term @xmath73 in eq .",
    "[ der_cond ] , obtaining : @xmath74 and using eq .",
    "[ phi0 ] , also @xmath75    the third boundary condition sets the radius of the extra dimension @xmath76 : @xmath77 with @xmath78 where the last approximation is applied due to a small backreaction ( i.e. , @xmath79 , see eq .",
    "[ aprime ] ) in which case we can neglect the contribution from the quadratic terms @xmath80 .",
    "recall that the hierarchy of scales in rs setups is given by @xmath81 , which , using eq .",
    "[ stabrad ] , gives in our case @xmath82 .",
    "this is in contrast to the gw case where @xmath83 .",
    "thus , the required hierarchy of scales is obtained in our case when @xmath84 ( i.e. , when @xmath85 ) , while in the gw case the condition is @xmath86 ( i.e. , @xmath87 ) .",
    "the remaining fourth boundary condition , @xmath88 in eq .  [ phi_boundary_2 ] , which we have omitted from the above discussion , naively seems to involve a severe fine - tuning to ensure @xmath89 . in order to understand this apparent problem ,",
    "let us re - write the original equation of the boundary condition for @xmath90 explicitly ( see eq .  [ phi_boundary ] ) : @xmath91 which is generically of the form @xmath92    as we have shown above , in order to have a phenomenologically acceptable framework , @xmath93 has to be significantly smaller than @xmath94 , or more specifically @xmath95 ( see eq . [ phi_solution ] ) .",
    "this seems to require fine - tuning between the @xmath96 terms @xmath97 in eq .",
    "in particular , these constant @xmath96 terms have to cancel up to @xmath98 .",
    "however since there are no additional free parameters left , this equation has to be exactly tuned in any case ( i.e. , even when @xmath99 ) in order to ensure a vanishing 4d cosmological constant - this is exactly the cosmological constant problem plaguing any rs setup .",
    "the level of fine - tuning required in the general case is , therefore , @xmath100 orders of magnitude , far greater than the fine - tuning required by any @xmath94 terms in this equation .",
    "thus , the condition / requirement ( in our case ) that @xmath89 has no effect on the level of fine - tuning required for the cosmological constant problem . in turn , in our scenario , this seems to imply that whatever solves the cosmological constant problem should be manifest on the planck brane or in its vicinity - a reasonable assumption from the phenomenological perspective .",
    "we thus find that the only fine - tuning required in our scenario is that of the cosmological constant which is inherent in any rs construction with a stabilized radius ( as in the gw mechanism ) .    in order to have a solution for @xmath76 we need @xmath101 ( see eq .  [ stabrad ] ) .",
    "it was already stated that in order to generate the desired ew - planck hierarchy , @xmath102 has to be small but not hierarchically small .",
    "it is easy to verify that for @xmath103 the condition of @xmath101 is satisfied , with only a small amount of tuning involved .",
    "we further make the simplifying assumption that @xmath104 , which is satisfied if @xmath105 , so that @xmath106    as mentioned above , we take the backreaction to be small , or equivalently take @xmath107 ( see the second term in eq .",
    "[ aprime ] below ) . under this assumption , the metric field @xmath16 can be calculated from eq .",
    "[ zeroenergy ] : @xmath108 where @xmath109 so that @xmath110 and @xmath25 is now parameterizing the backreaction .",
    "in particular , @xmath111 at lowest order , consistent with our assumption above .",
    "let us give a brief account of the free parameters involved in our setup , i.e. , the parameters @xmath112 , @xmath113 , which appear in the scalar potentials in the bulk and on the two branes .",
    "as we have seen , @xmath114 and @xmath115 do not enter the solution in the small backreaction approximation ( see eq .",
    "[ der_cond ] ) .",
    "also , the condition of a stabilized radius requires @xmath103 , which leads to @xmath116 .",
    "the size of the extra dimension , @xmath76 , which is given as a function of @xmath112 and @xmath117 ( eq .  [ stabrad ] ) , sets the bulk mass parameter @xmath52 by requiring that it reproduces the desired hierarchy between the ew and planck scales , i.e. , @xmath118 , leading to @xmath119 ( see discussion below eq .",
    "[ eta2 ] ) .",
    "as for the brane tensions , @xmath120 is set by the cosmological constant tuning condition ( eq .  [ plancktune ] ) , while @xmath121 is traded with the value of @xmath38 on the tev brane , i.e. , @xmath122 .",
    "we are thus left with three parameters : @xmath123 and @xmath46 and the kk - scale will be determined by the exact value of @xmath124 .",
    "in particular , @xmath118 will be required in order to keep the kk - scale at the tev range .",
    "it is also instructive to consider the dual cft picture that corresponds to our scenario .",
    "as noted in the introduction , the doublet scalar on the ads side is dual to a doublet operator @xmath8 on the cft side , giving @xcite : @xmath125 which is marginal when @xmath126 . in particular , under the ads / cft duality , @xmath127 , so that the condition we have just derived for the ew - planck hierarchy , i.e , that @xmath128 , is the same as the condition that the dual operator in the cft picture is marginal . for comparison , in the gw mechanism the singlet scalar is dual to a singlet operator appearing linearly in the lagrangian @xmath129 .",
    "the marginal dimension for such an operator is @xmath130 , which is satisfied on the ads side when @xmath131 .",
    "thus , the condition in the gw mechanism that @xmath132 , is responsible for both the generation of the ew - planck hierarchy and the marginality of the cft deformation .",
    "let us now consider the fluctuations about the above ( classical ) background .",
    "we will closely follow the discussion in @xcite .",
    "it is easy to verify that the goldstone modes are not relevant , as only the first derivative of the scalar potentials enters the einstein equations @xcite .",
    "the relevant scalar and metric excitations , denoted here as @xmath133 and @xmath134 , are thus defined as follows : @xmath135    one can then derive , from the einstein equations , the coupled wave equations for both excitations @xcite : @xmath136 which implies that the physical fluctuations @xmath137 and @xmath138 correspond in fact to the same state .",
    "the kk expansion of the coupled system can be written as @xmath139 where each kk mode in the above kk expansion satisfies @xmath140 , so that eq .",
    "[ wavef ] , with the solution for @xmath38 in eq .",
    "[ phi0eq ] , gives @xmath141    then , to the lowest non vanishing order of the backreaction , the solution for the zero mode , which is our  higgs - radion \" state , is given by @xcite : @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the mass of the lowest excitation in the kk tower of @xmath137 and @xmath138 ( eqs .",
    "[ kkphi ] and [ kkf ] ) , i.e. , of our higgs - radion , and together with the integration constant @xmath144 , it is determined by the boundary conditions ( see below ) .",
    "note that in the solution to eq .",
    "[ waveffull ] , @xmath145 is linear with the backreaction @xmath25 .",
    "we therefore define it using @xmath146 , which is independent of the backreaction .",
    "the relevant boundary conditions in our case are a bit different from the ones used in @xcite , as we can not make the simplifying assumption @xmath147 .",
    "in particular , they are : @xmath148_i=\\frac{\\partial^2 v^{brane}_i(\\phi_0)}{\\partial \\phi^2 } \\varphi + 2 \\frac{\\partial v^{brane}_i(\\phi_0 ) } { \\partial \\phi}f \\label{bcf1}~.\\ ] ]    recall that the condition of a stabilized radius requires @xmath149 , which for a phenomenologically viable size of the radius ( i.e. , when @xmath150 ) leads to @xmath116 .",
    "thus the solution to eq .",
    "[ bcf1 ] , to lowest order in @xmath151 and @xmath102 , is given by : @xmath152 and , under the same assumptions , the effective 4d vev is ( @xmath118 ) : @xmath153 we thus find that the ratio between the higgs - radion mass and the 4d vev is : @xmath154 so that , for @xmath155 gev and @xmath156 gev , the curvature of the extra dimension is determined ( up to some theoretical uncertainty ) : @xmath157 , which is within the validity range of this ratio , see @xcite .",

    "furthermore , a scenario with mixing between the pure radion and the higgs state is allowed @xcite , but in order to be consistent with the data it requires the 126 gev state to be higgs - dominated .",

    "we wish to add a few comments on some of the phenomenological implications of our findings .    *",
    "the list of branching ratios above indicates that only @xmath163 and @xmath164 are significantly larger than in the sm , i.e. , over 50% .",
    "we must stress , however , that in our considerations above , the 1-loop effect of the kk tower of particles on the decay widths and the production mechanism of @xmath0 has not been taken into account ; this may be especially relevant as these modes ( @xmath163 and @xmath164 ) are known to be amenable to sizeable corrections due to these effects  @xcite .",
    "while the photonic mode has already been the center of focus for quite sometime , we want to emphasize the importance of a direct measurement of the glu - glu branching ratio .",
    "this is clearly very challenging but attempts via @xmath165 and or via @xmath166 may well prove rewarding and deserve a high priority . * the allowed range of the kk - gluon masses in our picture is somewhat higher than what is expected to be accessible for direct production of kk - gluons at the lhc with 14 tev c.m .",
    "energy , as was emphasized in  @xcite .",
    "* there are few other features of our coupled higgs - radion picture and its confrontation with the lhc data that deserve brief remarks .",
    "first , since the kk - gluon mass needs to be around 5 tev , it may well be that custodial symmetry is needed to respect electroweak precision constraints ( ewpc )  @xcite .",
    "if so , our analysis can be extended to include a custodial symmetry in the bulk .",
    "furthermore , one of the most compelling rationale for the rs - warped idea is that it can be invoked to quite naturally understand flavor hierarchies @xcite .",
    "however , in its simplest (  anarchic \" ) implementation ( see agashe _",
    "et al _ in  @xcite ) , the resulting fcncs acquire some right - handed components which have enhanced effect on kaon mixing  @xcite .",
    "it , therefore , becomes difficult to lower the kk - gluon mass below @xmath167 tev without enforcing some additional flavor symmetry @xcite and/or some mild tuning @xcite .",
    "we hope to return to address these issues pertaining to ewpc and flavor in conjunction with our higgs - radion idea in the near future . *",
    "it is important to note that our solution suffers from a  little - hierarchy \" problem , i.e. @xmath168 . it will be interesting to see whether the solution to this problem in the rs scenario can be implemented here as well .",
    "the most notable idea is that of the higgs being a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson @xcite , living in a coset of so(5)/so(4 ) .",
    "this is manifested on the ads side as the fifth component of the so(5)/so(4 ) gauge boson in the bulk @xcite , the effective potential for which is generated due to radiative corrections .",
    "this is in fact some form of a bulk higgs with a vev profile , and it is conceivable that a stabilization of the radius could be achieved here as well .",
    "we have explored a scenario where the ew - planck hierarchy is stabilized by the presence of an @xmath9 scalar doublet in the bulk of an rs setup . in particular , we have showed that the 5d vev profile of this bulk doublet can have a dual role : breaking the ew symmetry and at the same time stabilizing the radius of the warped extra dimension , i.e , the ew - planck hierarchy of scales .",
    "the conditions for the stabilization were derived and found to be different from the conventional rs scenario which employ the goldberger - wise ( gw ) mechanism .",
    "our setup does not require any additional fine - tuning other than the one associated with the 4d cosmological constant , also present in the gw framework .",
    "the lowest excitation of the coupled su(2 ) scalar doublet  gravity system , denoted here as the  higgs - radion \" , is identified with the recently discovered 126 gev scalar .",
    "we derive the couplings of our higgs - radion which turn out to be significantly different from those of a pure radion in rs models .",
    "this is due to the fact that the higgs - radion state has a component in the 5d bulk doublet that has direct couplings to the sm fields .",
    "we calculate the higgs - radion production and decay processes relevant for the lhc , and find that it is compatible with all the present higgs data for a kk gluon mass of the order of 5 tev . since the higgs - radion signals are found to deviate from the sm in some of the channels ( e.g. , @xmath164 and @xmath163 ) , we expect that with more data it will be possible to verify or exclude our setup .",

    "<S> we investigate a randall - sundrum model with an su(2 ) doublet propagating in the bulk . upon calculating its gravitational effect </S>",
    "<S> we find that a stabilized radius can be generated without the use of an additional scalar , as needed for example in the goldberger - wise ( gw ) mechanism , and with no additional fine - tuning other than the inescapable one due to the cosmological constant ; similar tuning is also present in the gw mechanism . the lowest scalar excitation in this scenario , the counterpart of the radion of the gw mechanism , has both radion - like and higgs - like couplings to the sm fields . </S>",
    "<S> it , thus , plays a dual role and we , therefore , denote it as the  higgs - radion \" ( @xmath0 ) . as opposed to the gw radion case , our higgs - radion is found to be compatible with the 126 gev scalar recently discovered at the lhc , at the level of @xmath1 , with a resulting 95% cl bound on the kk - gluon mass of : @xmath2 . an important consequence of our setup should be accentuated : the radion of the traditional rs scenarios simply does not exist , so that our higgs - radion is not the conventional mixed state between the gw radion and the higgs . </S>"
