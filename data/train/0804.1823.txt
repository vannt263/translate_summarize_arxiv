    "recently , we developed a formulation for determining binary elements with astrometric observations .",
    "the simplified solution is written in terms of elementary functions , and therefore requires neither iterative nor numerical methods ( asada et al .",
    "this solution has been generalized to a binary system in open ( hyperbolic or parabolic ) orbits as well as closed ( elliptic ) ones ( asada 2007 ) .",
    "an extension to observational data has been also discussed ( asada et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the solution gives an explicit form of binary elements such as the eccentric anomaly and the major axis of elliptic orbits .",
    "oyama et al .",
    "( 2008 ) made an attempt to use this solution for discussing some uncertainty in binary elements because of large scatter of their data points , when they measured proper motions of maser sources in the galactic center with vera .",
    "on the other hand , the remaining parameters of the time of periastron passage and the longitude of ascending node are not discussed in the simplified solution .",
    "hence , the solution is rather simplified .",
    "however , these parameters are needed to make a comparison between the simplified solution and conventional ones .",
    "in addition , the lack of information on the remaining parameters apparently suggests a certain incompleteness of the simplified solution . in this brief article , therefore , we shall derive , in the framework of the simplified solution , both the time of periastron passage and the longitude of ascending node in order to complete the solution .",
    "astrometry plays a fundamental role in astronomy through providing useful star catalogs based on precise measurements of the positions and movements of stars and other celestial bodies . for instance , astrometric observations provide an useful method of determining mass of various unseen celestial objects currently such as a massive black hole ( miyoshi et al .",
    "1995 ) , an extra - solar planet ( benedict et al . 2002 ) and two new satellites of pluto ( weaver et al .",
    "astrometry of sharpless 269 with vera detects a trigonometric parallax corresponding to a distance of 5.28 kpc , which is the smallest parallax ever measured , and puts the strongest constraint on the flatness of outer rotation curve ( honma et al .",
    "2007 ) . accordingly",
    ", astrometry has attracted renewed interests , since the hipparcos mission successfully provided us the precise catalog at the level of a milliarcsec .",
    "in fact , there exist several projects of space - borne astrometry aiming at a accuracy of a few microarcseconds , such as sim ( shao 2004 ) , gaia ( mignard 2004 , perryman 2004 ) and jasmine ( gouda et al .",
    "2007 ) .    in this paper , we focus on an astrometric binary , for which only one of the component stars can be visually observed but the other can",
    "not , like a black hole or a very dim star . in this case , it is impossible to directly measure the relative vector connecting the two objects , because the secondary is not directly observed .",
    "the position of the star is repeatedly measured relative to reference stars or quasars . on the other hand ,",
    "the orbit determination of resolved double stars ( visual binaries ) , which are a system of two visible stars , was solved first by savary in 1827 and by many authors including kowalsky , thiele and innes ( binnendijk 1960 , aitken 1964 for a review on earlier works ; for the state - of - the - art techniques , e.g. , eichhorn and xu 1990 , catovic and olevic 1992 , olevic and cvetkovic 2004 ) . the relative vector from the primary star to the secondary has an elliptic motion with a focus at the primary .",
    "this relative vector is observable only for resolved double stars .    in conventional methods of orbit determination ,",
    "the time of periastron passage is one of important parameters because it enters the kepler s equation as @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the time of periastron passage , orbital period , eccentricity and eccentric anomaly , respectively ( e.g. , danby 1988 , roy 1988 , murray and dermott 1999 , beutler 2004 ) .",
    "the simplified solution does not use the kepler s equation in order to avoid treating such a transcendental equation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "our notation in the simplified solution will be summarized in @xmath5 2 .",
    "the time of periastron passage in the simplified solution will be derived in @xmath5 3 . the longitude of ascending node will be obtained in @xmath5 4 .",
    "our notation in the simplified solution is briefly summarized as follows .",
    "we neglect motions of the observer and the common center in our galaxy .",
    "namely , we take account only of the keplerian motion of a star around the common center of mass of a binary system .",
    "let us define @xmath6 as the cartesian coordinates on a celestial sphere , in such a way that the apparent ( observed ) ellipse on the celestial sphere can be expressed in the standard form as @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "the eccentricity @xmath9 is @xmath10 .",
    "this eccentricity may be different from @xmath3 , the eccentricity of the actual elliptic orbit , because of the inclination of the orbital plane with respect to the line of our sight .",
    "the star is located at @xmath11 on the celestial sphere at the time of @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "we use a fact that the law of constant - areal velocity still holds , even after a keplerian orbit is projected onto the celestial sphere . here , the area is swept by the line interval between the star and the projected common center of mass but not a focus of the apparent ellipse ( see fig .",
    "@xmath14 ) .",
    "this fact is expressed as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the area swept during the time interval , @xmath18 for @xmath19 , and the total area of the apparent ellipse @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "the swept area is expressed as ( asada et al .",
    "2004 , asada 2007 ) @xmath21 .",
    "\\label{areas}\\ ] ] the eccentric anomaly in the apparent ellipse is given by @xmath22 .",
    "the orbital elements can be expressed explicitly as elementary functions of the locations of four observed points and their time intervals ( asada et al .",
    "let us take four observed points @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 for @xmath27 . the location @xmath28 of the projected common center is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are elementary functions of @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 . the eccentric anomaly in the actual ellipse ( on the orbital plane ) is denoted as @xmath4 ( see eq .",
    "@xmath39 ) .    given @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43",
    ", we can analytically determine the parameters @xmath3 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 as ( asada et al .",
    "2004 ) @xmath47 where @xmath48",
    "in order to determine @xmath45 and @xmath49 for an actual ellipse , the simplified solution requires neither the time of periastron passage @xmath1 nor the longitude of ascending node , @xmath50 ( asada et al .",
    "if one wishes to know @xmath1 and @xmath50 , however , they can be determined as follows ( see also fig .",
    "first , we discuss @xmath1 in this section .",
    "the projected position of the periastron on the celestial sphere , @xmath52 , is determined as @xmath53 because the ratio of the semimajor axis to the distance between the center and the focus of the ellipse remains unchanged , even after the projection ( asada et al .",
    "the eccentric anomaly @xmath54 of the periastron in the apparent ellipse is introduced as @xmath55 where @xmath52 is given also by eq .",
    "( @xmath56 ) .",
    "thereby , we can determine @xmath54 ( mod @xmath57 ) .    by using eq .",
    "( @xmath58 ) , we obtain @xmath59 where we can determine @xmath60 because the eccentric anomaly in the apparent ellipse at @xmath1 , denoted as @xmath61 , is nothing but @xmath54 , which has been determined by eqs .",
    "( @xmath56 ) and ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "therefore , eq . @xmath63 is solved for @xmath1 as @xmath64 where the r.h.s .",
    "is obtained from observed quantities .",
    "let us consider the projected periastron at @xmath52 on the apparent ellipse . in the simplified solution , @xmath52",
    "is expressed as eq .",
    "( @xmath56 ) . here",
    "we make a translation of @xmath6 in such a way that the common center of mass can be located at the origin of new coordinates @xmath65 .",
    "namely , the @xmath66 axis is taken to lie along the major axis of the apparent ellipse in the celestial sphere , and the @xmath67 axis is perpendicular to the @xmath66 axis in the celestial sphere ( see fig .",
    "@xmath68 ) . in the coordinates @xmath65 , the position of the projected periastron becomes @xmath69 on the other hand , by projecting the actual ellipse onto the celestial sphere , we obtain @xmath70 where the coordinates @xmath71 are chosen so that the ascending node can be in the @xmath72-direction ( see fig .",
    "@xmath68 ) .",
    "the longitude of ascending node , which is the angle between the @xmath72 and @xmath66 axes , relates the two coordinates of @xmath65 and @xmath71 by rotation .",
    "therefore , from eqs . @xmath73 and @xmath74 ,",
    "we obtain @xmath75 this relation determines @xmath50 ( mod @xmath57 ) . for instance",
    ", we obtain explicitly @xmath76 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath46 in the r.h.s .",
    "have been determined by eqs .",
    "( @xmath77 ) , ( @xmath78 ) , ( @xmath79 ) and ( @xmath80 ) .    in conventional methods , determining @xmath50",
    "is tightly coupled with @xmath46 and @xmath44 . on the other hand",
    ", it can be done separately from @xmath46 and @xmath44 in the simplified solution .",
    "it should be noted that in practical applications a reference direction chosen by observers may be different from the major axis of the apparent ellipse .",
    "in such a practical case , @xmath50 is the angle from the reference direction to the direction of the ascending node . to compute the longitude of ascending node ,",
    "therefore , the angle @xmath81 from the reference direction to the major axis is added into the angle measured from the major axis . in short ,",
    "the longitude of ascending node is generally the sum of @xmath82 and @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the angle @xmath50 determined by using eq .",
    "the expression of @xmath81 is obtained in the straightforward manner , for instance as eq .",
    "( 6 ) in asada et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , where they denoted @xmath81 as @xmath50 .",
    "tables 1 and 2 give an example to show the flow of actual determination of all six orbital elements .",
    "this would be helpful to the readers who code computing routines in practical applications to check their programs .",
    "table 1 shows some given values for all six orbital elements and the orbital period .",
    "based on these elements , we first prepare a virtual observation data set , which is listed in table 2 .",
    "the elements are then reproduced from the data by using the proposed method .    here , we discuss how to determine in the simplified solution a position of a component star at arbitrary time @xmath84 ( mod @xmath2 ) . for @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 ,",
    "( @xmath58 ) becomes @xmath88 this is a transcendental equation for @xmath89 on the celestial sphere .",
    "this situation seems similar to that the kepler s equation is transcendental in @xmath4 on the orbital plane .",
    "here we should note that the time of periastron passage is needed in order to treat kepler s equation , whereas it is not for eq .",
    "( @xmath90 ) .",
    "this is because we employ the time interval @xmath91 , while the kepler s equation needs the time itself instead of the interval .",
    "regarding this point , thiele s method for visual binaries is closer to the simplified solution , in the sense that they use the time interval in order to delete the time of periastron passage .",
    "a crucial difference is that thiele s method uses kepler s equation on the orbital plane ( thiele 1883 ) , while the simplified one does the constant areal velocity in the apparent ellipse on the celestial sphere . in this sense ,",
    "the simplified solution more respects measured quantities on the celestial sphere than conventional ones ( see fig .",
    "@xmath92 ) .",
    "it is verified numerically that the above procedure enables us to determine in the simplified solution locations of a star at arbitrary time ( see fig .",
    "@xmath93 for an example ) .",
    "in this paper , we obtain in the simplified solution both the time of periastron passage and the longitude of ascending node in order to complete the solution ( see fig .",
    "@xmath92 ) . in conclusion ,",
    "the simplified solution requires neither iterative nor numerical methods when we determine all the elements including @xmath1 and @xmath50 .",
    "it does only when we wish to determine the star s position at arbitrary time . before closing this paper , it is worthwhile to mention that eqs .",
    "( @xmath94 ) , ( @xmath95 ) and ( @xmath90 ) can be applied to a case of open orbits in the straightforward manner . for open orbits ,",
    "expressions of @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath3 , @xmath45 , @xmath44 and @xmath46 have been already derived in the framework of the simplified solution ( asada 2007 ) .",
