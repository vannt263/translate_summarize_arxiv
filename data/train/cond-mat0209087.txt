    "at certain faces of metals , such as the ( 111 ) face of noble metals , the surface electron states are confined to the vicinity of the top layer by the vacuum barrier on the vacuum side and the bandgap on the substrate side @xcite .",
    "the electrons in these surface states form a two - dimensional nearly free electron gas @xcite .",
    "it has also been observed that when adsorbing one to several monolayers of alkali atoms on these surfaces a manifold of discrete standing wave states , so called quantum well states ( qws ) , perpendicular to the surface are formed .",
    "these states can be detected , for instance , in photoemission spectroscopy ( pes ) @xcite , inverse photoelectron spectroscopy ( ipes ) @xcite , two photon photoemission spectroscopy ( 2ppes ) @xcite and scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) @xcite .",
    "a large amount of experimental data is available for the system na on cu(111 ) @xcite",
    ". the electronic structure and dynamics for this system have also been investigated by first - principles theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "these localized surface states are of great interest since they play an important role in many physical processes like epitaxial growth @xcite , surface catalysis @xcite , molecular ordering @xcite and adsorption @xcite .",
    "experimental tools like stm and pes play an important role in the investigations , since they enable spatial and spectroscopic resolution of the electron states .",
    "one important discovery is the confinement of surface state electrons in so called quantum corrals .",
    "these man - made nanoscale structures are formed by deliberately assembling adatoms to enclosed structures by stm @xcite . due to the small size of the corrals ,",
    "quantum effects are present , and both spatial and spectroscopic properties of the confined states can be studied experimentally .",
    "a natural way of forming low - dimensional structures on metal surfaces is by controlled growth of epitaxial layers . with an appropriate choice of deposition and annealing temperatures small islands , so called quantum dots ( qd ) , with variable shapes and sizes may form @xcite .",
    "the advantage of these structures , in comparison with the corrals , is that they are relatively stable at low temperatures .",
    "this enables the imaging and investigation of their properties without inducing structural damage .",
    "one quantum mechanical effect of the confinement is the increase of the surface state energy which in turn may lead to the depopulation of the surface state band and thereby changes in the surface properties .    in this paper we present",
    "calculated results for the electronic structure of na on cu(111 ) , with the emphasis on describing the real - space resolved density of states nearby a sodium qd adsorbed on a sodium - covered cu(111 ) surface .",
    "previously , an all - electron density - functional theory ( dft ) study of a free - standing na layer in vacuum has been presented @xcite .",
    "more recently , a dft calculation using ultrasoft pseudopotentials for the free - standing na layer as well as for the layers adsorbed on cu(111 ) have been presented@xcite . a simple free electron model calculation for a free - standing na qd",
    "has already been published by two of the present authors@xcite .",
    "the calculations in this work are made in the context of the dft @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the rayleigh - quotient multigrid ( rqmg ) method in axial symmetry@xcite is used for the numerical solution of the ensuing kohn - sham equations .",
    "the electron - ion interaction is simplified using the jellium model @xcite , where the ions are replaced by a rigid positive background charge of constant density .",
    "this model has provided basic physical understanding of the electronic structures of simple metal surfaces @xcite thin metal films @xcite , vacancies and voids inside metals @xcite and finite clusters of simple metal atoms @xcite .",
    "recently , also uniform cylindrical nanowires have been studied within the jellium model @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ naoncu ] gives a short review over experimental results for the system na on cu(111 ) , section [ compmet ] describes the computational method used in the calculations , section [ model ] discusses the details of our jellium model and in section [ meas ] the results are presented and comparisons are made with experimental findings .",
    "finally , section [ conclusion ] gives the conclusions .",
    "alkali metals adsorbed on the closed - packed ( 111 ) surface of metals form hexagonal structures at saturated monolayer coverages , following approximately the underlying substrate structure @xcite .",
    "the first monolayer of na on cu(111 ) is observed to saturate at the coverage of @xmath1 @xcite , corresponding to 4 na atoms per 9 surface cu atoms .",
    "the na atoms thus form a hexagonal ( 3/2 @xmath2 3/2 ) structure and the na atom spacing of @xmath3 is comparable to the atomic distance of @xmath4 in bulk na .    the adsorption of na atoms on the cu(111 ) surface will induce a charge redistribution at the interface between the adlayer and the substrate .",
    "it has been seen from photoemission experiments @xcite that when the na coverage is increased the cu shockley surface state decreases in energy . for coverages above @xmath5 the surface state",
    "is shifted below the lower band edge of the local band gap of the cu(111 ) surface , and is no longer visible in photoemission experiments .",
    "two - photon photoemission experiments @xcite indicate other unoccupied na - induced states in the local bandgap at the cu(111 ) surface , which will also decrease in energy with increasing na coverage . for higher coverages , the lowest of these states will be down - shifted below the fermi energy , and thus get occupied . at the saturated monolayer coverage",
    ", this state will be located about @xmath6 @xcite below the fermi energy at the @xmath7-point of the surface brillouin zone ( sbz ) .",
    "the corresponding next lowest state will be located @xmath8 above the fermi level @xcite at the @xmath9-point .",
    "the lower of the two states has one node in the @xmath10-direction , while the higher has two .    if the na atom deposition continues after the first monolayer ( ml )",
    "is completed , a second layer will start to grow .",
    "recent stm measurements @xcite indicate that the second monolayer of na grows via the formation of compact islands with hexagonal atomic arrangement .",
    "normal photoemission experiments @xcite indicate that when the second monolayer grows the emission intensity due to one - monolayer states decreases gradually , and for coverages above 1.3 ml a new peak , approximately @xmath6 above the fermi energy appears .",
    "this peak is ascribed to the two - monolayer thick parts , and the energy is shifted to somewhat lower values as the coverage is increased .",
    "some theoretical attention has also been paid to na on cu(111 ) , including the island growth .",
    "free - electron model calculations have been performed for circular na @xcite as well as hexagonal ag @xcite and na @xcite free - standing islands .",
    "all - electron calculations for an unsupported monolayer of na @xcite and first - principles slab calculations for one atomic na layer in ( 2 @xmath2 2 ) and ( 3/2 @xmath2 3/2 ) adsorbate structures on cu(111 ) @xcite have been presented . in the present paper ,",
    "we report jellium model calculations for an unsupported monolayer of na and a cylinder shaped free - standing na qd .",
    "we also present two - density - jellium calculations for the system na on cu(111 ) , where we have modeled the underlying cu(111 ) substrate by using a lower density slab to mimic the decay of the surface states into the substrate .",
    "comparison is made with experiments and previous theoretical calculations .",
    "in the kohn - sham scheme of dft , one solves the electron density @xmath11 of the system selfconsistently from a set of equations .",
    "one of these equations is the single particle schrdinger equation .",
    "the models used in this work are axially symmetric .",
    "thus the schrdinger equation is separable , and the wave functions can be written as products @xmath12 above , @xmath13 is the azimuthal quantum number implied by the axial symmetry while @xmath14 differentiates between orthogonal states with same @xmath13 and @xmath15 . in the calculations involving the infinite monolayer ,",
    "two * k*-vectors are used as explained in sec .",
    "[ model ] .",
    "the external potential of the systems studied in this work is caused by the positive background charge @xmath16 .",
    "the effective potential @xmath17 includes also the hartree potential of the electron density and the exchange - correlation potential @xmath18 , which we treat in the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite . the electron density @xmath11 is obtained by summing single - electron densities with the occupation numbers @xmath19 .",
    "the degeneracies of the states are taken into account by the factor @xmath20 and the occupation numbers @xmath19 obey the fermi - dirac statistics with a fermi level ( @xmath21 ) so that the system is neutral .",
    "a finite temperature of 1200 k is used to stabilize the solution of the set of equations .",
    "thus , in the present axial symmetry ( @xmath22 ) the kohn - sham equations read as    @xmath23    @xmath24    @xmath25    @xmath26 .",

    "is directly minimized , the orthogonality constraint being taken into account by a penalty functional . the poisson equation ( [ poisson ] )",
    "is solved for the electrostatic potential @xmath28 using a standard multigrid method @xcite .    to obtain selfconsistency",
    ", we use the simplest possible potential mixing scheme , @xmath29 the largest system of this work contains 2550 electrons , the diameter of the supercell being @xmath30 .",
    "obtaining selfconsistency in such a system requires a very small @xmath31 value of 0.005 .",
    "otherwise the charge sloshing results in divergence .",
    "more sophisticated mixing strategies@xcite will be indispensable in the future calculations .",
    "however , because of the simplicity of our model systems , we can very accurately estimate an initial guess for the selfconsistent effective potential of large systems using the more easily convergent smaller systems as reference .    in our largest calculation",
    "a grid of @xmath32 points is used for the presentation of the wave functions , potential and density .",
    "taking into account the unoccupied states needed in the modeling , up to 2400 different states have to be solved at every selfconsistency iteration .",
    "luckily , it is straightforward to parallelize the calculation over the 65 different @xmath13 values and the two * k*-points ( see below ) .",
    "moreover , the rqmg method@xcite handles this part of the calculation with optimal efficiency .    the two - jellium model for the surface described in sec . [ model ]",
    "results in an asymmetric density distribution with a surface dipole .",
    "thus the electrostatic potential on the substrate side is a constant different from that on the vacuum side . for the poisson equation",
    ", we thus use the boundary condition of zero derivative on the substrate side , and that of zero value on the vacuum side . solving the poisson equation , the boundaries above and below the system",
    "are extended to a distance five times greater than in the case of the wave functions .    in this work ,",
    "we calculate the local density of states ( ldos ) above a surface at distances corresponding to those typical in stm measurements ( of the order of @xmath33 ) . at such distances ,",
    "the amplitude of the wave function decreases by several orders of magnitude .",
    "this kind of modeling is thus a serious test for the rqmg - method .",
    "we have checked the accuracy of our method for the spherical harmonic oscillator and a model hydrogen atom potential , for which the wave - functions are known analytically .",
    "the evanescent tails of the wave functions solved with the rqmg method agree with the analytical ones , even when the amplitude of the wave functions has dropped by 20 orders of magnitude .",
    "this level of accuracy is beyond the reach of plane - wave methods , where periodic boundary conditions are necessary , and which provide a uniform accuracy across the calculation volume , resulting in spurious oscillations in the vacuum parts of the system .",
    "we are interested in the system of a monolayer - thick na qd on the complete na monolayer on the cu(111 ) surface . we know from experiments that these islands are approximately hexagonal in shape , following the underlying structure of the na monolayer",
    "in order to interpret recent stm data for these types of systems , mapping the energy resolved real - space electron density near a qd is necessary .",
    "first , it is of interest to find what level of theoretical modeling is required .",
    "it has been shown previously @xcite that simple two - dimensional particle - in - a - box calculations give qualitatively good results , in the sense that the peak structure of ldos resembles spectra obtained in the stm @xmath0 measurements . in this work",
    "we improve the theoretical description by performing selfconsistent three - dimensional dft calculations , where the effects of the underlying monolayer and substrate are introduced .",
    "the hexagonal qd is modeled by a cylindrical jellium qd , and the underlying na monolayer and cu(111 ) substrate by the two - density jellium slab , as described below .",
    "comparisons between calculations of free - standing qd s and qd s on a substrate show indeed that the underlying monolayer and substrate induce a new type of states that the simple particle - in - a - box calculations can not account for .",
    "since the @xmath10-dependence of wave - functions is included in our calculations , we can calculate the tunneling current at realistic stm - tip distances above the system , and estimate the energy dependence of the step height from the calculated constant current topographs .        .",

    "our model is readily applicable to the case of a free - standing cylindrical quantum dot , where we use zero dirichlet boundary conditions for the wave functions and for the coulomb potential .",
    "the next step is to model a free - standing monolayer .",
    "a uniform planar system can not be exactly reproduced in the axial symmetry .",
    "we adopt an approximation scheme analogous to the wigner - seitz method@xcite .",
    "we imagine the plane being filled by hexagons , and then approximate these hexagons by area - covering circles . in order to sample the brillouin zone of the lattice of circles we use two @xmath15-points , @xmath34 and @xmath15 at the brillouin zone boundary .",
    "the wave functions with @xmath34 are required to have a vanishing radial derivative at the radius of the circle whereas the wave functions with @xmath15 at the brillouin zone boundary vanish there . according to our calculations the model gives a uniform ( @xmath35-independent ) charge distribution for the monolayer .",

    "it can be used for measuring the real - space electronic distribution with atomic resolution , as well as the local energy distribution of electrons and the lifetimes of excited electron states .",
    "the real - space distribution is achieved when scanning the surface either in the constant current mode , where the tunneling current is kept constant by changing the tip - surface distance using a feedback mechanism , or in the constant height mode , where the tunneling current is measured when scanning the surface at a constant tip height .",
    "the resulting image then displays the topography of the surface .",
    "information about the local electronic structure is obtained by measuring the current variation with the applied voltage .",
    "this quantity , the differential conductance @xmath0 , is proportional to the product of the local density of states ( ldos ) and the transmission coefficient @xmath67@xcite .",
    "however , if the applied voltage is small , the bias dependence of @xmath67 is small , and with eq .",

    "only the @xmath53 states contribute , while away from the axis also peaks with @xmath75 occur .",
    "the ldos peaks can be labeled with the  quantum number  @xmath76 by counting for the number of radial nodes of the corresponding wave functions in the 2 ml part ( see fig .",
    "[ bigg_island_fig_a ] ) . for @xmath13=0 ,",
    "the @xmath77 state has no radial nodes in the dot region whereas @xmath78 has one radial node and so on for larger @xmath76 .",
    "as in the case of the smaller dot discussed above in sec .",
    "[ qdot ] , the states strongly peaked in the qd are resonance states due to the hybridization with the states of the surrounding monolayer and span the whole system .",
    "besides the delocalization of the states , the resonance character causes the fact that in the ldos ( fig .",
    "[ bigg_island_fig_a ] ) several peaks may correspond to the same resonance state as discussed earlier for the smaller system .",
    "we have identified the ldos peaks by examining the wave functions .",
    "the horizontal lines below the quantum numbers @xmath13 and @xmath76 connect the peaks belonging to the resonance in question .",
    "the relative positions of peaks appearing in the experimental @xmath0 spectra by kliewer and berndt @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "[ bigg_island_fig_a ] as arrows pointing downwards .",
    "the experimental data is shifted so that the lowest experimental peak coincides with the lowest calculated peak .",
    "the experimental spectrum is recorded slightly off from the center of the hexagonal qd which should be taken into account when comparing with the calculated results .",
    "previous two - dimensional free - electron calculations for hexagonal potential boxes have reproduced well the experimental peak positions @xcite . in the present modeling ,",
    "the experimental peak positions agree with the calculated @xmath53 resonance positions with the exception of the third and fifth experimental peak .",
    "the calculated @xmath53 resonances obey the pattern @xmath79 , as would be expected for a free particle in a hard - wall cylinder .",
    "we have fitted @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "it is gratifying to note that in the ldos recorded off the cylinder axis strong @xmath82 resonance peaks appear so that the third and fifth experimental peaks can be explained .",
    "thus , our model can reproduce quantitatively the experimental peak positions . according to our calculations the resonance width increases toward to higher energies .",
    "the increase is maybe slightly stronger than in experiment , indicating a somewhat too weak confinement of the resonance states in our model .",
    "we have also calculated the isosurfaces of the ldos at the energies corresponding to the dominant peaks in fig .",

    "the density is smooth in the interior of the qd and shows minor oscillations at the perimeter of the qd .",
    "the development of the nodal structure is clear and compares qualitatively well with that found in the experimental @xmath0 maps @xcite .",
    "it can also be seen that the isosurfaces corresponding to the two @xmath83 peaks differ from each other mainly near the perimeter of the dot .",
    "the higher peak shown at the energy corresponding to the highest ( 0,3 ) state , on the other hand , does not show equally clear ( 0,3)-character .",
    "the explanation is a state with quantum numbers ( 2,2 ) at almost exactly the same energy .    from eq .",

    "units on the scale of fig .",
    "[ bigg_island_fig_a ] .",
    "the absolute height of the isosurface from the jellium edge depends naturally on the ldos value chosen , but , according to our calculations , the relative changes are insensitive to the ldos value over a wide range of values . in order to construct the apparent step height",
    "we first obtain the numerical constant current topographs ( eq . [ current ] ) , then average the profiles over the oscillations above the 2 ml and 1 ml parts of the system and take the difference .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ stepfig ] as a function of the bias voltage .",
    "the trends seen can be explained by studying the ldos - isosurfaces ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ stepfig ] ) , and then noting that the constant current surfaces are obtained by simple integation ( eq . [ current ] ) . at -100 mev ,",
    "the second band starts to contribute in the 1 ml part of the system rising the height there and thereby lowering the step height .",
    "then the onset of the third band in the 2 ml part rises the step again .",
    "this rise is similar to that seen in the experiment by kliewer and berndt@xcite as well as the decline at higher voltages .",
    "however , the comparison with the experimental result shows differences : our step height is too low by a factor of 2 , and the raising of the step at negative bias voltages is not seen in the experiment",
    ". there may be several reasons for the differences in the step heights .",
    "one is that the experimental step height of @xmath42 ( @xmath86 ) , which is determined at a voltage just before the rise in the step height , is directly used as the thickness of the jellium describing the second monolayer of na .",
    "a more consistent procedure might be to take the voltage dependence into account .",
    "moreover , the apparent step height depends on the relative vacuum decay rates of the second and third band states of the 1 ml and 2 ml systems , respectively .",
    "their correct description may be too demanding for our simple model .",
    "in this paper we have presented a model for the electronic structures of alkali metal islands or quantum dots adsorbed on metal surfaces . in particular ,",
    "we have focused on the system of na on the cu(111 ) surface , where approximately hexagonal na quantum dots have been observed to form during the epitaxial growth of the second na monolayer .",
    "we have modeled the quantum dots as small cylindrical jellium islands , and the underlying na monolayer and cu substrate as a two - density jellium slab .",
    "the parameters of the model have been chosen to fit experimental spectroscopic data and calculated first - principles band structures for one and two completed monolayers of na on the cu(111 ) surface .",
    "the calculations were performed in the context of the density - functional theory , using a real - space electronic structure calculation method .",
    "the calculated results are compared with experimental findings from scanning tunneling microscope and photoemission experiments .",
    "the model gives local densities of states which are in a quantitative agreement with constant current topographs and @xmath0 spectra and maps .",
    "thereby the idea of surface states which are localized as resonances at the quantum dots is supported .",
    "the future applications of the model will include studies of the adsorption and dissociation of molecules in the vicinity of alkali metal quantum dots .",
