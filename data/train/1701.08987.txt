    "recently , @xcite have obtained stellar ages to about 10% accuracy using seismic data in addition to spectroscopic observations .",

    "nasa s _ kepler _ space mission has observed solar - like oscillations in over hundred sun - like main - sequence stars .",
    "the legacy sample consists of 66 main - sequence stars observed in short cadence mode for at least 12 months ( most of the stars have a time series of approximately 3 years ) , and spans a large range in metallicity .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the locations of the stars in the hertzsprung - russell diagram .",
    "we used the spectroscopic and seismic data from @xcite , and refer the reader to that paper for the details on the target selection , compilation of the spectroscopic data , and the computation of the stellar oscillation frequencies ( see also , * ? ? ?",
    "acoustic glitches inside a star are regions where the sound speed or its derivatives show an abrupt variation on length scales shorter than the typical wavelengths of the acoustic modes .",
    "such glitches introduce an oscillatory component , @xmath2 , in the frequencies of stellar oscillations as a function of the radial order , @xmath3 , of the form , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the acoustic depth of the glitch ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and @xmath6 is the phase of the oscillatory signal .",
    "the two main sources of acoustic glitches in a sun - like main - sequence star are the base of the envelope convection zone ( cz ) where the second derivative of the sound speed , @xmath7 , is discontinuous , and the helium ( he ) ionization zone where the first adiabatic index , @xmath8 , varies rapidly .",
    "both of these glitches lie deep inside the star where the non - adiabatic effects are weak , and the glitch signatures are not significantly affected by the poorly understood near - surface layers . the boundary of the core convection zone does not contribute a significant oscillatory signal as this is aliased to a signal with a very small acoustic depth @xcite , and that can not be distinguished from the background smooth component of the frequency .",
    "it was customarily believed that the oscillatory signal from the helium ionization zone arises from the dip in @xmath8-profile in the second helium ionization zone .",
    "the fitted acoustic depth of the helium signal was , however , found to be significantly smaller than the depth of the he ii ionization zone , and @xcite attributed this difference to the neglect of the acoustic cut - off frequency in the phase function and the signal from the he i ionization zone .",
    "@xcite found that the fitted acoustic depth of the helium signal in the models of the red - giants agrees with the acoustic depth of the peak in @xmath8-profile between the he i and he ii ionization zones .",
    "@xcite did a detailed study of glitch signals from various ionization zones of helium in main - sequence stellar models to find that the fitted acoustic depth always matches that of the peak in @xmath8 between the two ionization zones .",
    "their attempt to fit the signatures from both ionization zones of helium resulted in a significantly better fit for the solar oscillation frequencies , but the fit was again to the usual peak between the two helium ionization zones , and a peak above the hydrogen ionization zone .",
    "more significantly , the inclusion of the second glitch did not affect the parameters for the helium glitch ( the glitch between the two helium ionization zones ) .",
    "hence in this work , we fit the glitch signature from the helium ionization zone only .",
    "the amplitudes of the oscillatory signature from the acoustic glitches are approximately three or more orders of magnitude smaller than the background smooth component , which makes it hard to extract them from the stellar oscillation frequencies .",
    "there are two popular approaches to extract the glitch signatures : the first attempts to fit the oscillation frequencies directly , while the second tries to fit the second differences of the oscillation frequencies .",
    "we use both fitting methods , method a and method b as described below , to derive the glitch parameters .",
    "the two independent methods can be used to assess the associated systematic uncertainties in the estimated glitch properties .",
    "there are again two different approaches to extract the glitch signatures from the stellar oscillation frequencies : the first removes the smooth component from the frequencies as a function of radial order , @xmath3 , and fits the residual ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the second approach fits the smooth component and the glitch signals simultaneously ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have used the second approach in this work as described below .",
    "we model the smooth component of the oscillation frequency using a @xmath9-dependent fourth degree polynomial in the radial order , @xmath3 , where @xmath9 is the harmonic degree .",
    "the functional forms of the glitch signatures are adapted from @xcite .",
    "we fit the oscillation frequency , @xmath10 , to the function , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the contribution of the smooth component with @xmath13 being the coefficients of the polynomial .",
    "the second term is the oscillatory contribution coming from the base of the convection zone with @xmath14 related to the amplitude , @xmath15 being the acoustic depth of the base of the convection zone , and @xmath16 being the phase of the signal .",
    "the third term is the oscillatory contribution coming from the helium ionization zone with @xmath17 related to the amplitude , @xmath18 related to the width of @xmath8-peak between the he i and he ii ionization zones , @xmath19 being the acoustic depth of the @xmath8-peak , and @xmath20 being the phase .",
    "this function contains a total of 22 free parameters when fitting @xmath9 = 0 , 1 , and 2 modes ( @xmath21 polynomial coefficients @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) .    to determine the parameters of eq .",
    "( [ metha ] ) , we perform a regularized least - squares fit by minimizing the function , @xmath22 ^ 2 +            \\lambda^2 \\sum_{n , l}\\left[\\frac{d^3p_{l}(n)}{dn^3}\\right]^2 , \\label{chi2g}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the quoted uncertainty on the observed @xmath10 and @xmath24 is the regularization parameter . note that we have used a third derivative regularization instead of the second derivative used in @xcite .",
    "the third derivative regularization marginally improves the stability of the fit .",
    "the regularization parameter is determined in the same way as in @xcite for the solar oscillation frequencies , and the same value is used for stars in the _ kepler _ legacy sample .",
    "the cost function @xmath25 defined in eq .",
    "( [ chi2 g ] ) is a nonlinear function of the fitting parameters , hence the fit may not converge to the global minimum , particularly if the initial guess is not close enough .",
    "we search for the global minimum in a subspace of the parameter space by repeating the fitting process for 100 sets of randomly chosen initial guesses .",
    "the fit with minimum value of the standard chi - square ( first term in eq .",
    "[ chi2 g ] ) among 100 trials is accepted as the best fit .",
    "we generate 1,000 realizations of the observed oscillation frequencies assuming the uncertainties on them are uncorrelated and normally distributed .",
    "we fit all the realizations to get the distributions of the fitted parameters .",
    "the median of the distribution is accepted as the parameter value while the @xmath26 and @xmath27 percentiles of the distribution give the negative and positive errorbars .",
    "the oscillatory signature from the base of the convection zone is typically weak with the amplitude of the order of the errors on the oscillation frequencies .",
    "consequently , the distribution of the fitted parameters may have multiple peaks .",
    "we use only those realizations for which the fitted acoustic depth falls in the dominant peak to calculate the median and error estimates .",
    "the parameters associated with the cz signature may not be correct due to the problem of aliasing @xcite , in which case the fitted acoustic depth is found to be the complement of @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath28 ( where @xmath29 is the acoustic radius of the star ) . in spite of the problem of aliasing , the glitch analysis is useful as it can restrict @xmath15 from its infinite possible values to two numbers , viz . , @xmath15 and @xmath30 . in some cases , particularly for relatively massive stars with large errorbars on the oscillation frequencies , there may not be any well defined peak in the distribution of the fitted parameters for the convection zone signal , as the values may be spread over a wide interval .",
    "this is a well known method for extracting the signatures of the acoustic glitches from the observed stellar oscillation frequencies ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the oscillation frequencies follow closely the asymptotic expression of @xcite , which predominantly depends linearly on the radial order for a given degree . hence taking the second difference of the oscillation frequency with respect to @xmath3",
    ", @xmath31 reduces the background smooth component significantly .",
    "this , however , complicates slightly the fitting procedure because the differences have correlated errorbars , and the covariance matrix has to be used in the definition of the chi - square to be minimized .",
    "we fit the second differences of the oscillation frequencies to the following function adapted from @xcite , @xmath32 where the first two terms take care of the residual smooth component left after the second differences are calculated ; the third term is the oscillatory contribution coming from the base of the convection zone with @xmath33 related to the amplitude , @xmath15 being the acoustic depth of the base of the convection zone , and @xmath34 being the phase ; the fourth term is the oscillatory contribution coming from the helium ionization zone with @xmath35 related to the amplitude , @xmath18 related to the width of @xmath8-peak between the he i and he ii ionization zones , @xmath19 being the acoustic depth of the @xmath8-peak , and @xmath36 being the phase .",
    "the above amplitudes of the oscillatory signatures in the second differences may be converted to the corresponding amplitudes in the oscillation frequencies by dividing them with @xmath37(see , * ? ? ?",

    "we again search for the global minimum as in method a with 100 trials on the initial guesses .",
    "the parameter values and the associated errorbars are computed using the distribution of the parameters obtained by fitting 10,000 realizations of the observed oscillation frequencies .",
    "the cz signature has the same limitations as those discussed in the context of method a.",
    "we modeled each star in three different ways using various methods and evolutionary codes .",
    "the approaches are briefly described below .",
    "we used the modules for experiments in stellar astrophysics code ( mesa ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for stellar modeling .",
    "this code can be used with various input physics and data tables .",
    "we used the opal equation of state @xcite , opacity project ( op ) high - temperature opacities @xcite supplemented with low - temperature opacities from @xcite .",
    "the metallicity mixtures from @xcite was used .",
    "we used reaction rates from nacre @xcite for all reactions except @xmath41 and @xmath42 , for which updated reaction rates from @xcite and @xcite were used .",
    "convection was modeled using the standard mixing - length theory @xcite .",
    "an exponential overshoot @xcite was included for stars with masses greater than 1.10 m@xmath43 .",
    "the diffusion of helium and heavy elements was incorporated for stars of masses less than 1.35 m@xmath43 using the prescription of @xcite . for higher mass stars ,",
    "the diffusion prescription clearly overestimates the settling of helium and heavy elements in the envelope , and hence was not used .",
    "the adiabatic oscillation frequencies were calculated using the adiabatic pulsation code ( adipls ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we constructed models independently for each star in the legacy sample on a mesh of stellar parameters  the mass @xmath44 , initial helium abundance @xmath45 , initial metallicity @xmath1_i$ ] , mixing - length @xmath46 , and the overshoot parameter @xmath47 .",
    "we generated 1,000 to 2,000 randomly distributed mesh points for an individual star in a reasonable subspace of the parameter space ( we start with a chosen subspace with 1,000 mesh points , and extend it uniformly if the best - fit model falls near the edge ) .",
    "the models corresponding to every mesh point were evolved until the track enters in a box formed by the @xmath48 uncertainties in the observed effective temperature @xmath49 , surface metallicity @xmath1 $ ] , and average large frequency separation @xmath38 .",
    "we fitted the surface corrected model frequencies @xcite to the observed ones to break the degeneracy inside the box , and accept the best - fit model as a representative model of the concerned star . in this manner , we get an ensemble of approximately 1,000 to 2,000 representative models ( depending on the total number of mesh points ) for each star .",
    "note that the number of models in the ensemble is not exactly same as the number of mesh points , because not all the tracks enter the box .",
    "we took two different approaches to get the best - fit model from the above ensemble : the first approach used the conventional spectroscopic and seismic data but did not use the glitch information ( termed as ` _ seismicfit1 _ ' ) , while the second used all the information including from the glitches ( termed as ` _ glitchfit _ ' ) .",
    "these two approaches are used only for the mesa models . in _ seismicfit1 _ , we defined a cost function , @xmath50 where @xmath51 represents 6 observable quantities ; the @xmath49 , @xmath1 $ ] , large frequency separation averaged over the radial modes @xmath52 , average two - point frequency ratio @xmath53 , and the five - point ratios @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( @xmath56 is suitably chosen radial order , and the choice of @xmath57 is made to avoid the correlation among the observables ) .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for the definition of the ratios .",
    "the @xmath58 was minimized over the model ensemble to get the best - fit model , and the uncertainties on the fitted parameters were estimated from the envelope of the @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) .",

    "_ , we incorporated the information coming from the glitch analysis to our fitting pipeline . for this purpose , we fitted the signatures of the acoustic glitches in the frequencies of all the models in the ensemble using method a to find the various parameters associated with the base of the convection zone and helium ionization zone , and defined a cost function , @xmath60 where @xmath61 represents 3 observable quantities ; amplitude of helium signature averaged over the frequency range @xmath62 , width of the @xmath8-peak @xmath63 @xcite , and the acoustic depth of the @xmath8-peak .",
    "note that there is no ambiguity in comparing the acoustic depths of the helium ionization zone as obtained by fitting the observed and model frequencies .",
    "a model representing the star must have similar helium glitch as the star , and should leave similar signature on the oscillation frequencies , and hence the fitted @xmath19 for both must be close .",
    "the differences arise when we try to associate the fitted acoustic depth to a layer in the helium ionization zone ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we did not include the parameters associated with the cz signature in the definition of @xmath64 for the reasons that we discussed earlier in section  [ subsec : freq ] .",
    "we minimized the @xmath64 over the ensemble to get the best - fit model , and the uncertainties on the fitted parameters were estimated in the same way as in _ seismicfit1_. the mesa model in the subsequent sections would always refer to the best - fit model obtained in this manner , unless stated otherwise .",
    "the above methods find the best - fit model in two steps . in the first step , we fix the evolutionary stage for a set of initial conditions ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath1_i$ ] , @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) using oscillation frequencies , and filter out reasonable models of the star . the oscillation frequencies monotonically decrease as a star evolves , and",
    "hence reasonably constrain the evolutionary stage for a given initial condition .",
    "the model frequencies have systematic uncertainties due to the surface effect , hence we do not use them in the second step , instead use the quantities that are relatively insensitive to the surface effect , viz . , the frequency ratios . in this manner , we use both the oscillation frequencies and their combinations to get the best - fit model . since the methods preserve a set of reasonable models of the star , we may plot chi - square as a function of different stellar parameters , which gives additional useful information , e.g. , the possibility of the secondary solutions .",
    "a second set of best - fit models were calculated using the yale rotating stellar evolution code ( yrec ; * ? ? ?",
    "the models used opal high temperature opacities @xcite supplemented with low - temperature opacities of @xcite .",

    "a large subset of the models included the diffusion of helium and other heavy elements with the diffusion coefficients from @xcite .",
    "the coefficients , however , were changed with a multiplicative factor that depended on the mass of the models to inhibit the complete depletion of helium and heavy elements in the envelope convection zone .",
    "the coefficients were unchanged for the models with masses up to of 1.25 m@xmath43 , while for higher masses the coefficients were multiplied by a factor , @xmath68 $ ] , where @xmath44 is the mass in solar unit .",

    "this fitting method also does not use the glitch information and have been applied only to the yrec models . the reason for using two different names ( _ seismicfit1 _ and _ seismicfit2 _ )",
    "is that the detailed optimization process and the observables used are different in the two cases . for each star , we start with using the average large frequency separation and frequency of maximum power along with the spectroscopic estimate of the effective temperature to get an estimate of the mass ( @xmath44 ) and radius ( @xmath69 ) of the star using the yale birmingham grid - based modeling pipeline @xcite .",

    "we fitted the signatures of the acoustic glitches in the oscillation frequencies of all the 66 stars using both methods described in section  [ sec : fit ] .",
    "the quality of fit primarily depends on the mass of star .",

    "note the small amplitude of the helium signature in the fit for kic 8760414 .",

    "the fit to the cz signature was also generally robust for stars of sub - solar and solar masses , with only a few problematic cases . however , fitting cz signature was difficult for super - solar mass stars , particularly for stars of @xmath76 m@xmath43 , which gave rise to multiple peaks in the distribution of @xmath15",
    ". such stars are generally hot , and the envelope convection excites modes with shorter life - time , which leads to larger line - width of the modes and larger errorbar on the mode frequencies . for some problematic stars , most of the oscillation frequencies have errorbars that are larger than the average amplitude of the cz signature .",
    "we modeled each star in the legacy sample using the approaches described in section  [ sec : model ] to find the best - fit model and corresponding oscillation frequencies .",

    "an uncertainty in the definition of the acoustic surface introduces a fixed shift in the acoustic depths calculated using sound - speed profile . here , we assumed the acoustic surface to be the top most layer of the eddington atmosphere ( @xmath466 ) .",
    "the scaled differences of less than 0.03 between the fitted and calculated acoustic depths suggest that the true acoustic surface is not very far from the assumed layer .",
    "the points corresponding to the difference between the acoustic depths obtained by fitting the observed and best - fit model frequencies are more scattered .",
    "this is primarily due to the fact that the observed frequencies have associated observational uncertainties , and the fit to the weak cz signature in the observed frequencies is more prone to aliasing than the fit to the model frequencies .",
    "the helium ionization zones are extended in depth .",
    "traditionally , it has been assumed while modeling the form of the he glitch signature that it arises from the he ii ionization zone ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the results obtained using method b look very similar . as can be seen from the topmost panels , the acoustic depth of the base of the convection zone decreases as the mass ( hence the effective temperature ) increases .",

    "the variation of the amplitude and the acoustic depth with @xmath83 , @xmath52 , and @xmath73 can again be understood mostly in terms of the variation of these parameters with the mass and effective temperature .",

    "the secondary solution in the left panel , on the other hand , corresponds to a model that has surface helium abundance similar to the sun , and hence their oscillation frequencies have similar average amplitude of helium signature , and contributes negligibly to the chi - square if the average amplitude is included in its definition .",

    "it has been studied previously using _ kepler _ data .",
    "for instance , @xcite estimated the mass , radius , age , and the initial helium abundance of the star to be @xmath508 m@xmath43 , @xmath509 r@xmath43 , @xmath510 gyr , and @xmath511 , respectively , while @xcite found them to be @xmath512 m@xmath43 , @xmath513 r@xmath43 , @xmath514 gyr , and @xmath515 .",
    "we derived the physical properties of this star without using the information from the glitch analysis , and the results are listed in the third row of table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "the small surface helium abundance is a result of both the small initial helium abundance and large helium diffusion . in all the above determinations , the interesting point to note",
    "is that the initial helium abundance was found to be significantly sub - primordial ( @xmath516 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the age to be close to the age of the universe ( @xmath517 gyr ; * ? ? ?",
    "the fourth row of table  [ tab2 ] lists the parameters obtained using _ glitchfit_. the initial helium abundance is now greater than the amount of helium produced during the big bang nucleosynthesis , and is in line with the expectation from the helium - to - metal enrichment relation .",
    "it is interesting to note that the age of the star has come down significantly .",
    "figure  [ fig12 ] compares the observed helium glitch signature with the corresponding signatures in the best - fit model frequencies . as we may expect from the too small surface helium abundance in the best - fit model obtained using _",
    "seismicfit1 _ , the amplitude of the helium signature is smaller than the corresponding observed amplitude .",
    "the amplitude of the helium signature in the model frequencies obtained using _ glitchfit _ is in better agreement with the observed one , particularly the amplitude averaged over the frequency range ( better tracer of the helium abundance ) are in much better agreement .",
    "there are several stars in the legacy sample for which the results do not change on including the glitch parameters in the stellar model fitting .",
    "kic 6106415 is an example of such a star .",
    "the results for this star are listed in the fifth and sixth rows of table  [ tab2 ] , and are consistent with the results of earlier works ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "the numbers in the two rows are exactly the same because the best - fit models using two approaches turned out to be the same .",
    "note from table  [ tab2 ] that the masses , radii , and the ages were off only by about @xmath469 in the cases where secondary minimum was picked up by the _ seismicfit1 _ approach .",
    "this , in a way , justifies the other methods , which use only the spectroscopic and seismic data in the stellar model fitting .",
    "we fitted the signatures of the acoustic glitches in the oscillation frequencies of 66 main - sequence stars observed by _",
    "kepler _ satellite using two different methods , and derived the acoustic depths of the base of the convection zone and helium ionization zone .",
    "we found that the signature from the he glitch is strong and the corresponding fit is robust for all stars , while the fit to the signature from the base of the convection zone is generally robust for the solar and sub - solar mass stars , but it is difficult to reliably fit its signature for super - solar mass stars .",
    "we fitted two different sets of best - fit model frequencies for all stars , and confirmed the findings of @xcite and @xcite for the models of real stars that the fitted acoustic depth of the helium ionization zone correspond to the peak in the first adiabatic index between the first and second helium ionization zones .",
    "we used the parameters associated with the helium glitch ( average amplitude , width , and acoustic depth ) together with the spectroscopic and seismic observables in the stellar model fitting to determine the stellar properties .",
    "the inclusion of the he glitch parameters puts tighter constraints on the stellar models , particularly on the initial helium abundance , and leads to a relatively more accurate set of stellar properties .",
    "this was demonstrated explicitly for the sun - as - a - star and kic 8760414 by modeling them with and without the information from the glitch analysis .",
    "there are other stars in the sample with the bimodal distribution of chi - square ( similar to what is shown in figure  [ fig10 ] ) , for which the information from the glitch analysis helps constrain their properties better .",
    "we studied the dependence of the various glitch parameters on the stellar parameters in the spirit of ensemble asteroseismology .",
    "we found that the acoustic depths of the base of the convection zone and helium ionization zone are positively correlated .",
    "since the determination of @xmath19 is reliable , we propose that the correlation be used as a guide to pick up the correct peak in the distribution of @xmath15 ( see , figure  [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] ) , in cases when it has multiple peaks .",
    "the average amplitude of the helium signature increases not only with the helium abundance but also with the mass ( hence the effective temperature ) , therefore a careful calibration is required to estimate the envelope helium abundance .",
    "the helium abundance obtained using the information from the glitch analysis is expected to be more reliable , and a detailed analysis using different methods , including its determination from the calibration of the observed average amplitude of the helium signature , will be presented in future .",
