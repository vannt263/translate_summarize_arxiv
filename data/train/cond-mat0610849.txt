    "theoretical description of high - temperature superconductors ( htscs ) remains one of the most important unsolved problems of modern condensed matter theory .",
    "however , despite the lack of complete understanding of this phenomena , some facts about the cuprate materials are almost generally accepted by scientific community .",
    "first of all , it is believed that superconductivity in this materials is mainly generated in @xmath2 layers , since even samples with the layer spacing of @xmath3 demonstrate very high critical temperatures .",
    "second , these materials in undoped regime are antiferromagnetic insulators , which transform into superconductors when the doping is larger than some critical value .",
    "experiments indicate the presence of strong antiferromagnetic correlations in the superconducting regime @xcite .",
    "third , the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter is of a @xmath4-wave type in many of the compounds @xcite .",
    "it is believed by many researches that these facts contain sufficient information to understand the phenomena of htsc .",
    "it is almost generally accepted that this phenomena can be described in the framework of a simple two - dimensional model of strongly correlated electrons ( for a recent over - review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the antiferromagnetic correlations produce a bcs - type spin - wave pairing between electrons .",
    "one of the most often studied model of htscs is the @xmath5-model @xcite ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown that the solution of this model within different approximations demonstrates @xmath4-wave superconductivity in the underdoped regime .",
    "this and many other models , however , are rather oversimplified , and they do not take into account some properties of the cuprates .",
    "in particular , it is known from arpes experiments that the free carrier spectra of some cuprates like @xmath6 in the insulating phase has its maxima not at the brillouin zone edge at momenta @xmath7 , but at points @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this fact suggests that the free carrier spectra must be @xmath8 , i.e. the doped carriers move only within one sublattice where they were born .",
    "this situation is similar to the case of collinear antiferromagnetic dielectrics with the neel ground state , where electronic and spin excitations ca nt move out of one sublattice to another .",
    "it is important that the excitations must live on non - equivalent sublattices , i.e. on the copper sublattices , which form an antiferromagnet .",
    "it is often assumed for several reasons ( see below ) , that doped holes in cuprates occupy sites in the oxygen subsystem of the @xmath2 planes @xcite .",
    "however , it is known that the n.n.n .",
    "hopping parameter for this sublattice is much smaller than the n.n . hopping parameter , which excludes the possibility to explain the spectra experiments @xcite in this case .",
    "one can try to overcome this difficulty by introducing the zhang - rice singlet , which consists of a doped oxygen hole coupled to one of the closest copper ions .",
    "the hole chooses the ion in such a way that the energy of the singlet is minimal .",
    "such states can move only within their magnetic sublattices .",
    "however , these states are unstable due to several reasons .",
    "first of all , the `` up '' and `` down '' spins of the copper ions enter in the linear combination of the zhang - rice singlet in an equivalent way , so a hole with the opposite spin projection will try to form the same singlet with the neighboring localized ion spin from another sublattice .",
    "also , the oxygen ions occupy states which are symmetrical with respect to the neighbor copper ions .",
    "therefore , the total exchange field which acts on a hole on the oxygen site is compensated , and the hole becomes frustrated with respect to the choice of the axis of the spin quantization .",
    "the proper axis of quantization can be established , but in this case the hole hybridized with the copper states will move in the @xmath2 plane not feeling the magnetic ordering .",
    "this also does nt allow one to explain the spectra experiments .",
    "these difficulties can be avoided by assuming that the doped holes sit on the copper sites @xcite .",
    "in fact , in the undoped state the @xmath2 planes consist of ions @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the doping leads to the valence change of some ions , which results in appearance of movable charges in the system .",
    "the assumption that the holes occupy the copper ions corresponds to the transitions @xmath11 , which are different from usually considered transitions @xmath12 in the case of the holes which occupy the oxygen sites .",
    "the reason for the last assumption follows from the fact that it is believed by many researches that the configuration @xmath13 has higher energy comparing to @xmath14 . however , the configuration @xmath13 can be preferable if one takes into account the coulomb attraction @xmath15 inside the configurations .",
    "in fact , since @xmath16 , and every copper ion is surrounded by four oxygen ions , at the same time as every oxygen is surrounded by only two copper ions , one can find that the corresponding coulomb attraction energy difference for two configurations is of order @xmath17 .",
    "this difference in the coulomb interaction energies can provide stability of the @xmath13 configuration comparing to other configurations , i.e. a possibility for the doped holes to move within the copper sublattices .",
    "this picture corresponds qualitatively to the @xmath5-model case .",
    "however , it was usually assumed that the free carrier dispersion relation in this model corresponds to the nearest neighbor hopping , which does not allow one to obtain the experimental spectra with the minimum at @xmath18 .",
    "a simple phenomenological hamiltonian , which corresponds to charge carriers that move within fixed sublattices , was proposed in order to describe superconductivity in cuprates at low carrier densities in @xcite .",
    "the effective attraction between the doped electrons on different sublattices was assumed to be equal to the antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath19 between nearest site spins .",
    "in fact , the carrier doping in the antiferromagnet leads to a breakdown of the antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath19 between nearest site spins .",
    "this results in an increasing of the energy of the system .",
    "this energy increasing is minimal when two empty sites are the nearest neighbors , because the minimal number of the antiferromagnetic spin - spin ( exchange ) interaction bonds is broken in this case .",
    "this phenomenological attraction was introduced for the first time by trugman in ref.@xcite . as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the order parameter , which corresponds to the pairs produced by such an interaction , has a @xmath4-wave symmetry .    below",
    ", the doping dependence of the @xmath4-wave superconducting gap in the model at different values of coupling and @xmath20 is studied .",
    "in addition , we analyze the temperature - doping phase diagram of the model .",
    "it is shown that the width of the pseudogap temperature region between the mean - field critical temperature @xmath21 and the critical temperature of the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition @xmath22 strongly depends on the carrier concentration .",
    "we make a qualitative comparison of the results with the experimental results on some htscs .",
    "the hamiltonian of non - interacting doped d - hole carriers in htscs can be approximated by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of the electron on site @xmath25 with spin @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the electron on - site energy , @xmath28 is the hopping parameter and @xmath29 is spin - spin correlation function calculated in the ion system of coordinates ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this hamiltonian can be transformed to the following form in terms of the hubbard operators in the laboratory system of spin coordinates : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a part of the hamiltonian which describes motion of free holes in an antiferromagnetically ordered medium , @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the lattice constant of a square lattice , @xmath34 and @xmath35 describe non - coherent inter - ion hole transitions with one and two spin excitations , correspondingly . @xmath36 and @xmath37 are spin creation and annihilation operators .",
    "it is important that expressions ( [ hamiltonian1])-([hint2 ] ) are written in terms of the hubbard operators , which directly take into account the antiferromagnetic ordering in the system .",
    "the ion spin projections in both magnetic sublattices are equal to @xmath38 in the ground state of the crystal ( we use local systems of coordinates for each sublattice ) .",
    "the spin conservation is also taken into account , which results in the fact that the electrons can move only on the magnetic sublattice on which they were born ( for details , see @xcite ) .    as it was mentioned in the introduction",
    ", a simple effective attraction between the doped electrons on different sublattices can be introduced @xcite .",
    "the carrier doping in the antiferromagnet leads to an increasing of the energy of the system , since it breaks the antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath19 between nearest site spins .",
    "the energy increasing is minimal when two doped particles occupy the nearest neighbor sites , since the minimal number of the antiferromagnetic spin - spin bonds is broken in this case . therefore , the doping leads to an effective attraction between carriers on different sublattices : @xmath39 the total hamiltonian of the system is @xmath40 .",
    "for simplicity , we neglect terms ( [ hint1 ] ) and ( [ hint2 ] ) , which do not contribute to a significant increasing of the superconducting critical temperature .",
    "the first term corresponds to a bcs - like interaction , which is small at low carrier densities , or fermi momenta of doped holes @xmath41 .",
    "it is proportional to the energy of spin waves @xmath42 , which is much smaller than the exchange energy @xmath19 .",
    "the term eq .",
    "( [ hint2 ] ) , which corresponds to two - magnon attraction , also does nt contribute to a significant increasing of the critical temperature in the @xmath4-wave pairing channel @xcite .",
    "therefore , a simplified version of the hamiltonian for the doped the antiferromagnet can be written as : @xmath43    in the case of an antiferromagnet on a square lattice with two sublattices , the free particle energy spectrum , which corresponds to the first two terms in eq .",

    "we use the units where the lattice constant is equal to one : @xmath48 . in order to have @xmath49 at @xmath50 one can choose @xmath51 .",
    "the chemical potential is connected with the free ( or doped ) particle number in the system by the following natural relation : @xmath52 where the sum goes over two sublattices . the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian2 ] ) has a simpler structure , comparing to the t - j - model hamiltonian , yet it can describe some of the main physical properties of underdoped cuprates .",

    "we assume that the generalized mean - field approximation eq .",
    "( [ linearization ] ) is good enough in the case of low carrier densities , when the free quasi - particle excitations correspond to the field represented by the hubbard operators eq .",

    "( [ et ] ) and ( [ deltat ] ) have a very simple physical interpretation .",
    "in particular , the second and the third terms in eq .",
    "( [ et ] ) , proportional to @xmath72 , lead to a renormalization of the chemical potential @xmath73 .",
    "the average @xmath74 multiplied by the hopping operator @xmath75 in the last term of eq .",
    "( [ et ] ) leads to renormalization of the quasiparticle bandwidth in the limit of low doping .",
    "however , one can put @xmath76 in this limit , since in the limit of low carrier concentrations @xmath77 , and the renormalization of the quasiparticle band is not strong .",

    "@xcite , the attraction ( [ hattr ] ) favours a superconducting pairing with the @xmath4-wave symmetry of the order parameter .",

    "this is similar to the phase diagram of cuprates , where there is a large pseudogap region above the critical temperature at low carrier densities .",
    "it must be stressed , that in the case of higher carrier densities , one must condsider a model with more complicated effective interaction , comparing to eq .
