    "newly formed stars are observed to have infrared ( ir ) excess due to their circumstellar disk composed of dust and gas ( @xcite ) .",
    "most older main - sequence ( ms ) stars , on the other hand , have photospheric emission with no excess in the ir .",
    "it is intuitive to conclude that the circumstellar disk evolves with time , gradually getting rid of the ir excess .",
    "one of the main questions in stellar astrophysics is how this happens .",
    "observational studies , as well as theoretical simulations , have demonstrated the interaction between star and disk .",
    "the stellar radiation facilitates disk evolution in terms of photoevaporation ( e.g. , @xcite ) or dust growth and settling ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the other direction",
    ", mass is accreted from the disk to the star following magnetic field lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a diversity of stellar temperatures , luminosities and masses among young stars has been known and studied for decades . facilitated by new ir and ( sub-)millimeter observations , a great variety of disk shapes , structures and masses",
    "is now being actively studied .",
    "the next step is to try to connect stellar and disk characteristics in order to understand the evolution of these systems .",
    "the study of a single object , however , is unlikely to provide unambiguous information regarding the evolutionary stage of the associated disk .",
    "most studies to date refer to samples of young stars scattered across the sky , or to sources distributed across large star - forming clouds like taurus .",
    "in addition to evolutionary stage , the specific environment in which the stars are formed may influence the evolution of disks by dynamical and radiative interaction with other stars or through the initial conditions of the starting cloud , making it difficult to separate the evolutionary effects ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for this reason , clusters of stars are very often used as laboratories for calibrating the evolutionary sequence ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the power of this method , to gain statistical information on disk composition in coeval samples , was found to be very successful for loose associations of older , pre - main sequence stars such as the 8 myr old @xmath2 cha @xcite and the 10 myr old tw hydrae association @xcite .",
    "identifying clusters of even younger disk populations is a natural step towards the completion of the empirical calibration of the evolution of disks surrounding young low - mass stars .",
    "this paper analyzes the inner disk properties of a flux - limited , complete unbiased sample of young stars with ir excess in the serpens molecular cloud ( d = 259 @xmath3 37 pc , @xcite ) which has a mean age @xmath4 myr , @xcite with an yso population in clusters and also in isolation .",
    "it has been recently argued ( l. loinard , private communication ) that the distance to serpens could be considerably higher than previously calculated .",
    "this would imply a rather younger median age for this cloud .",
    "the spitzer legacy program `` from molecular cores to planet - forming disks '' ( c2d ) has uncovered hundreds of objects with ir excess in five star - forming clouds ( cha ii , lupus , ophiuchus , perseus and serpens ) , and allowed statistical studies within a given cloud @xcite .",
    "the c2d study of serpens with irac ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath0 m , @xcite ) and mips ( 24 and 70 @xmath0 m , @xcite ) data has revealed a rich population of mostly previously unknown young stellar objects ( ysos ) associated with ir excess , yielding a diversity of disk seds ( @xcite ) . because of the compact area in serpens mapped by spitzer ( 0.89 deg@xmath5 ) , this impressive diversity of disks presents itself as an excellent laboratory for studies of early stellar evolution and planet formation .",
    "indeed , the serpens core ( cluster a , located in the northeastern part of the area studied by c2d ) has been well studied in this sense ( e.g. , @xcite ) , whereas only some of the objects in group c ( formerly known as cluster c ) were studied with isocam data @xcite .",
    "because of its wavelength coverage , sensitivity and mapping capabilities , the spitzer space telescope has offered an opportunity to study many of these systems ( star@xmath6disk ) in unprecedented detail .",
    "spitzer s photometry in the mid - ir , where the radiation reprocessed by the dust is dominant , gives information on the shape of the disks and , indirectly , its evolutionary stage ( assuming an evolution from flared to flat disks ) .",
    "follow - up mid - ir spectroscopic observations with the infrared spectrograph ( irs , 5  38 , @xmath0 m @xcite ) on - board spitzer probe the physical and chemical processes affecting the hot dust in the surface layers of the inner regions of the disk . the shapes and strengths of the silicate features provide information on dust grain size distribution and structure ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these , in turn , reflect dynamical processes such as radial and vertical mixing , and physical processes such as annealing . a smooth strong si  o stretching mode feature centered at 9.8",
    "@xmath0 m is indicative of small amorphous silicates ( like those found in the ism ) while a structured weaker and broader feature reveals bigger grains or the presence of crystalline silicates .",
    "polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) features are a probe of the uv radiation incident on the disk , whereas their abundance plays a crucial role in models of disk heating and chemistry ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the shape and slope of the mid - infrared excess provides information on the flaring geometry of the disks @xcite , while ice bands may form for highly inclined sources ( edge - on ) where the light from the central object passes through the dusty material in the outer parts of the disk @xcite .",
    "thus , the wavelength range probed by the irs spectra enables analysis of the geometry of individual disks .",
    "it also probes the temperature and dust size distributions as well as crystallinity of dust in the disk surface at radii of 0.1  few au . statistical results from a number of sources help the understanding of the progression of disk clearing and possibly planet formation .",
    "our group has been conducting multi - wavelength observing campaigns of serpens .",
    "optical and near - ir wavelength data , where the stellar radiation dominates , are being used to characterize the central sources of these systems @xcite .",
    "effective temperatures , luminosities , extinctions , mass accretion rates , as well as relative ages and masses are being determined . in this paper , we present a complete flux - limited set of spitzer irs spectra for this previously unexplored young stellar population in serpens .",
    "we analyze these spectra in terms of common and individual characteristics and compare the results to those of taurus , one of the best studied molecular clouds to date and dominated by isolated star formation .",
    "a subsequent paper will deal with the full sed fitting for the disk sources in serpens and their detailed analyzes .",

    "they used a number of color - color and color - magnitude diagrams to separate ysos ( both embedded ysos and young stars with disks ) from other types of sources , such as background galaxies and stars . in this manner , a set of 235 ysos was identified in serpens , in both clusters and in isolation , as described in   [ scf ] .",
    "these criteria , however , are not fail - proof .",
    "@xcite treated this problem very carefully in a statistical sense , but the locus region for ysos and , for instance , background galaxies overlap somewhat in color - color diagrams with spitzer photometry . therefore , some contamination may well still be present in the sample which was impossible to disentangle from photometry alone .",

    "no specific property or event that may influence the infrared dust signatures of a single disk ( stellar luminosity , spectral type , presence of a companion , disk - planet interactions , disk instabilities etc . ) produces detectable temporal or spatial evolutionary effects visible in the distribution of disk properties of an entire cluster within this time frame .",

    "reversible _ way .",
    "that is , the properties of disk surfaces may oscillate between different states @xcite .",
    "if some evolution of the disk surface is _ irreversible _ , and happens at a given rate , a stable distribution of surface properties would not be seen over time .",

    "another option is that the disk surface properties are determined by a single parameter , such as the initial conditions of the formation of such disks . in this scenario those properties",
    "should be kept `` frozen '' over the observed time scale of @xmath36few myr . however",
    ", this can not be the case for objects like ex lup , where real time changes of the disk surface properties after the initial formation of the disk have been observed on time scales of just a few years ( namely crystallization through thermal annealing of the dust in the disk surface , @xcite ) .",
    "for this theory to work , the putative oscillation of states proposed here must be stable over disk lifetimes of @xmath365 myr .",

    "@xcite identified candidate background stars based on optical spectra for 78 objects in this sample . after determining spectral types , extinctions and luminosities ,",
    "those objects were placed in a hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) and compared with 2 sets of isochrones and mass tracks ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "20 out of those 78 objects proved to be much too luminous to be at the distance of serpens ( @xmath58pc , @xcite ) .",
    "those objects were then classified as background sources , typically asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars with dusty shells .",
    "interestingly , 18 of the 20 objects classified as background in @xcite have irs spectra characteristic of background sources ; the other two objects , # 81 and 86 , show silicates in emission ( just like those seen in circumstellar disks ) and were then re - classified as ysos .",
    "besides these 18 objects , another 8 objects in this sample with falling mid - ir spectra show the 10 @xmath0 m silicate feature in absorption ( objects # 19 , 25 , 37 , 78 , 95 , 126 were not observed by @xcite ) , leading to their classification as background stars .",
    "alternatively , those 8 objects could be highly extincted ysos , with silicate features in absorption arising from such extinction .",
    "however , using the dense cloud dust properties , as in   [ ssi_ext ] , an extinction of 10 mag would produce a @xmath59 of only 0.14 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "since these objects do have silicate features in absorption , it is understood that they have high extinction ( considerably higher than what is found for the cloud at their location ) .",

    "in order to estimate the infrared luminosity ( @xmath66 ) , we use their best - fit relations between the ( rest - frame ) 24 @xmath0 m luminosity , @xmath66 and sfr ( eqs .",

    "their space density rises by about a factor of 10 from @xmath73 to @xmath74 @xcite , consistent with the relatively high redshifts found ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "furthermore , due to its high sfr and the empirical correlation between the infrared and radio emission from starburst galaxies @xcite , the ulirg # 12 at @xmath76 can be identified with a previously unidentified radio source in the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss j182817 + 001604 , @xcite ) .    the inferred sfrs range between 11 and 731 m@xmath8 yr@xmath77 , compared to a milky way sfr of about 35 m@xmath8 yr@xmath77 ( @xcite , and references therein ) . for further reference ,",
