    "the ageing of nodes is an important process in order to understand the way information or social networks grow @xcite . for instance , this process may be responsible for deviations to scale - free degree distributions @xcite or for the non - vanishing values of the clustering coefficient observed in many networks @xcite . ageing accounts for the fact that _ old _ nodes lose their ability to acquire new links as time goes on , thereby limiting the number of active nodes to a small fraction of the whole network .",
    "in general , this effect embodies the notion of generation for social agents , the lifetime of an information or of an article , etc ... such effects may be taken into account by attributing an age @xmath0 to nodes @xcite and by assuming that their probability to receive a link from a newly entering node depends on their age ( through some decreasing function of @xmath0 ) and , possibly , on other parameters such as their degree @xmath1 ( preferential attachment @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative model @xcite assumes that nodes can be deactivated with a probability proportional to @xmath2 . in this deactivation model ( dm ) ,",
    "once a node is deactivated , it is excluded from the network dynamics .",
    "dm is appealing because it mimics the fact that less popular nodes are more easily _ forgotten _ than the popular ones .",
    "this is the case for citation networks @xcite ( e.g. nodes are the articles and directed links are the citations of one article by another one ) , for instance , where highly cited papers usually continue to be cited for a long time , and vice versa .",
    "e.g. papers with more than 100 citations have an average citation age of @xmath3 years while the publications with more than 1000 citations have average citation age of @xmath4 years @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , dm is unsatisfactory because the underlying mechanism for this deactivation probability @xmath5 is not identified and a more fundamental model is therefore of interest .",
    "a similar lack of clarity also occurs when one tries to justify linear preferential attachment models @xcite .",
    "indeed , the latter imply that entering nodes have a global knowledge of the network , i.e. they must be aware of the degrees of every previously existing nodes before connecting to one of them .",
    "this unrealistic approach can be elegantly circumvented by introducing redirection @xcite or copying @xcite mechanisms . in the simplest version ,",
    "that one explains in terms of citation networks for the sake of clarity , an author who is writing the reference list for a new paper picks a random pre - existing paper .",
    "then the author cites either the randomly selected paper ( with probability @xmath6 ) or one of the references within that paper ( with probability @xmath7 ) .",
    "it is straightforward to show that this purely local process generates linear preferential attachment @xcite . in this article",
    ", we proceed along the same line of thought and introduce a model , called link activation model ( lam ) , that includes ageing effects .",
    "its interpretation is quite natural for information networks , such as citation networks .",
    "the system is a growing network where , for the sake of simplicity , entering nodes have only one outgoing link ( each paper cites one other paper ) .",
    "one assumes that only recent nodes are active but , contrary to previous models , a node is active if it has been introduced recently * or * if its has been cited recently . in detail ,",
    "when an author cites a paper , it either selects the latest paper ( the paper entered at the previous time step ) with probability @xmath8 or a random paper with probability @xmath9 .",
    "then , with probability @xmath7 , the author cites the paper cited by the selected paper . with probability @xmath6",
    ", he cites the selected paper .",
    "the model therefore depends on two parameters @xmath8 and @xmath7 that measure the importance of ageing and redirection processes as compared to random effects .",
    "there are four different possibilities that can take place at each time step , as summarized in fig.1 .",
    "an applet allowing the dynamical visualisation of the model should also be available online @xcite .",
    "let us stress that the ingredients of the model are very general and that lam is not limited to citation networks , but should also apply to other information networks , e.g. the web .    , the latest node receives the link from the entering node . with probability @xmath10 , the latest node is selected , but redirection takes place , so that the _ father _ of the latest node receives the link from the entering node .",
    "the two other possible configurations , associated to the random selection of a node ( in this example , node 3 ) , occur with probabilities @xmath11 and @xmath12.,width=604 ]    before going further , let us precise notations . initially ( @xmath13 ) , the network is composed of one node , the seed . for the sake of coherence",
    ", the seed has an outgoing link connected to itself . at each time step @xmath14 ,",
    "a new node enters the network .",
    "consequently , the total number of nodes is equal to @xmath15 , and the number of links is also @xmath16 .",
    "in this section , we focus on the height distribution , the height of a node @xcite being defined to be the length of the shortest path between this node and the seed .",
    "let us note @xmath17 the average number of nodes at the height @xmath18 . by construction , @xmath19 for all times .",
    "we also define @xmath20 to be the probability that the latest node is at height @xmath18 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that these quantities satisfy the coupled rate equations    @xmath21\\cr l_{g;t+1 } & = & ( 1-p ) \\frac{(1-r ) h_{g-1;t } + r h_{g;t}}{t+1 } + p [ ( 1-r)l_{g-1 } + r l_{g}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    except for @xmath22 : @xmath23 and for @xmath24 where one has the trivial solutions @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( this is due to the fact that an entering node can only arrive at height @xmath27 or higher ) .",
    "the above rate equations are derived in the usual way and generalise the equation with @xmath28 found in @xcite for instance .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "let us first focus on the case @xmath31 , where only latest nodes are selected , and take a continuous time limit ( this is justified a posteriori as we are interested in the long time behaviour of the model ) . in that case , one has to solve @xmath32 in the following , we are interested in the behaviour of the average total height @xmath33 .",
    "to do so , one also needs to evaluate the behaviour of @xmath34 which is the average height of the latest node and is easily found to satisfy @xmath35 consequently , @xmath36 asymptotically behaves like @xmath37 and the equation for the total height @xmath38 reads @xmath39 this equation leads to the asymptotic behaviour @xmath40 .",
    "this implies that the average height @xmath41 asymptotically increases linearly with time .",
    "moreover , the redirecting process slows down the growth of the network ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "this is expected as redirection favours the connection to nodes closer to the seed . in the limiting case @xmath31 , where the process is easily shown to lead to a star network ( i.e. all the nodes are connected to the seed )",
    ", one finds @xmath42 .    .",
    "in that case , the average height evolves linearly with time and one observes a large range of behaviours , from a aligned network ( @xmath43 ) to a star network ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the average height @xmath18 increases in a large - world way , i.e. linearly with time @xmath45.,width=604 ]    let us now focus on the more general case @xmath46 which reads in the continuum time limit @xmath47\\cr \\partial_t l_{g;t } & = & ( 1-p ) \\frac{(1-r ) h_{g-1 } + r h_{g;t}}{t+1 } + p [ ( 1-r)l_{g-1 } + r l_{g } ] - l_g.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by using @xmath48 and neglecting terms @xmath49 , one obtains the following set of equations for the above defined average quantities @xmath50 it is easy to simplify eq.[compl ] into : @xmath51 numerical integration of the above set of equations and our knowledge of the previous simplified cases ( e.g. eq.5 ) suggest to look for solutions of the form @xmath52 , @xmath53 . by inserting these expressions into eqs.[simpl ] and keeping leading terms in the long time limit @xmath54 , one finds the conditions @xmath55 which cease to be valid when @xmath31 , in agreement with the solution of eq.5 .",
    "consequently , the average height @xmath56 asymptotically grows logarithmically with time @xmath57 .",
    "this result should be compared with the linear regime @xmath45 taking place when @xmath31 .",
    "let us stress that such a transition from a large - world ( @xmath58 ) to a small - world @xcite ( @xmath59 ) network has already been observed in another model with ageing @xcite and is associated with the cross - over from a structured network , reminiscent of a one - dimensional line , to an unstructured network .",
    "the above solution is in agreement with the prediction @xmath60 taking place in a model without ageing @xcite .",
    "let us note by @xmath61 the average number of nodes with @xmath1 incoming links . for the sake of clarity ,",
    "we first focus on three simplified cases , @xmath43 , @xmath28 and @xmath31 before deriving results for general values of the parameters .",
    "when @xmath43 , there is no possible redirection and the stochastic mechanism takes place during the selection of a node . with probability @xmath8 ,",
    "the latest node , which has by definition zero incoming links , receives the link of the entering node , while with probability @xmath9 , a random node receives this link .",
    "consequently , the rate equation for @xmath61 @xcite reads @xmath62 where the last delta term accounts for the degree distribution of the newly entering node .",
    "we look for a stationary solution of the distribution @xmath63 which is determined by the recurrence relations @xmath64 its solution is easily found to be @xmath65 when @xmath28 , one recovers the exponential solution @xmath66 . for increasing values of @xmath8 , the tail of the distribution remains exponential , but its core is more and more peaked around @xmath67 . in the limiting case @xmath31 , the solution goes to a peaked distribution @xmath68 that corresponds to an aligned network ( see fig.2 ) .    in the case",
    "@xmath28 , lam reduces to the usual model with redirection for which it is well - known @xcite that the degree distribution evolves as @xmath69 + ( 1-r ) ( n_{k-1}-n_k )   + \\delta_{k,0 }   - n_k .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the stationary solution is therefore found by recurrence @xmath70 this stationary solution has a power - law tail @xmath71 whose exponent @xmath72 is obtained by inserting the form @xmath73 into the above equation . by keeping the leading terms in @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath74 , one has to solve @xmath75 so that one recovers the value @xmath76 derived in @xcite .    the case @xmath31 is slightly more complicated , due to the fact that the selected node is always the latest node .",
    "consequently , one also has to focus on the quantity @xmath77 that is the average number of nodes with degree @xmath1 that are cited by the latest node . by construction",
    ", this quantity satisfies @xmath78 ( because there is only one latest node by construction and this latest node has only one outgoing link ) and the system is described by the coupled set of equations @xmath79 let u note that the equations for @xmath80 and @xmath77 are quite similar , except for their loss term .",
    "this is due to the fact that all nodes that do not receive a link at a time step are cited by nodes that cease to be the latest node by construction .",
    "the stationary values of @xmath77 @xmath81 and of the distribution @xmath82 @xmath83 are found by recurrence . in the case @xmath43 , one recovers the distribution @xmath68 of the aligned network . before going further , let us stress that lam exhibits a very rich phenomenology , with a degree distribution that can behave like a delta peak , an exponential or a power - law depending on the parameters .    by putting together the contributions of the above limiting case , it is straightforward to write a set of equations for general values of @xmath8 and @xmath7 : @xmath84 \\cr & + &",

    "it is important to note that the tail of the distribution behaves like a power - law for any other value of the parameters .",
    "let us also note that eq.[solu ] is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath8 , for fixed values of @xmath7 , so that ageing mechanisms have a tendency to diminish the number of nodes with very high degrees .",
    "this can be understood by noting that ageing diminishes the probability for old nodes to be cited , while these old nodes are typically those with the highest degree .",
    "in this article , we have presented a simple model for growing networks with ageing .",
    "this link activated model incorporates the fact that articles remain present in the _ collective memory _ as long as they are cited or read .",
    "namely , articles that are the most likely to be cited are those that have been published recently or those that have been cited recently . in other words ,",
    "all sorts of articles that are _ present _ and may have punctually triggered the reader s curiosity .",
    "this natural process is shown to lead to a rich behaviour for the network structure , that leads to a transition from a large - world to a small - world network . moreover",
    ", various kinds of asymptotic stationary degree distributions may be reached depending on the model parameters : a delta peak that corresponds to a one - dimensional lattice , exponential - like distributions or power - law tailed distributions .",
    "let us insist on the fact that lam is quite general and should apply to many situations involving a competition between multiplicative effects ( _ rich gets richer _ ) and ageing .",
    "apart from citation networks that have been discussed above , one may think of _ short - lived _ information web - pages .",
    "a typical example is _",
    "_ where users propose a new information / article and are subject to the votes of the whole community of users .",
    "usually , informations lose their appeal within a few hours or days ."
