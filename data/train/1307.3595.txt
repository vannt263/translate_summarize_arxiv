    "here we consider a discrete unitary model of a quantum gas confined to a lattice . the model is called a quantum lattice gas .",
    "the model is useful for simulating many - body systems of strongly - correlated dirac particles @xcite  here we treat the simplest version of the model and thus restrict our study to quantum particle dynamics in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "quantum lattice gases were one of the earliest quantum algorithms devised @xcite .",
    "feynman s original representation of a path integral was the first quantum lattice gas algorithm @xcite , commonly known as the feynman chessboard model @xcite .",
    "this kind of algorithmic representation of quantum mechanics was the foundational idea that led feynman to conjecture that there should exist a universal quantum computational model for efficient quantum simulation @xcite .",
    "the quantum lattice gas model presented here is an improved version of an earlier model @xcite .",
    "the improved version has its unitary evolution operator generated by the dirac hamiltonian with no spatial error terms .",
    "the evolution operator is represented as a product of a unitary operator for the kinetic part of the evolution and a unitary operator for the particle - particle interaction part of the evolution , but not as a trotter decomposition @xcite .",
    "thus , in the improved model , we avoid the need for the grid s space and time scales to be infinitesimal for the model to be a faithful representation of the quantum particle dynamics .    in a quantum lattice gas system , a particle s occurrence at a point is encoded using a complex - valued probability amplitude . in a quantum lattice gas , at the grid - level , a particle s occurrence is encoded with a qubit .",
    "the grid - level kinetic transport equation is a discrete ( or finite - difference ) version of a quantum wave equation .",
    "that is , particle motion is restricted along a finite set of displacement vectors , yet each displacement vector in general has complex - valued components . hence , the lattice defined by this class of displacement vectors constitutes a quantum network . in such a quantum network , even without a chiral breaking interaction , in two or more spatial dimensions a free massless particle initially localized in space will become delocalized over time , whereas in one spatial dimension , spontaneous delocalization of a wave packet occurs only for massive particles .",
    "the dispersion of a particle s wave packet behaves quantum mechanically according to the heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "particle - particle interactions are represented by entangling quantum gates implemented at the grid points , so all the dynamics is strictly unitary and thus manifestly reversible .",
    "let us consider two paths in a 1 + 1 dimensional spacetime , with both paths starting at point @xmath1 and ending at point @xmath2 , for example , rendered at energy scale @xmath3 for @xmath4 time steps    @xmath5{zigzagpathisoscelestriangle60.pdf } } ; \\endxy\\ ] ]    with time increasing going upward .",

    "the two paths shown in ( [ zigzagpathisoscelestriangle60 ] ) are of equal lengths , so we have the linear identity @xmath12    now , we may consider the geometry of these two paths at an energy scale at an order of magnitude lower say , @xmath13    @xmath14{zigzagpathisoscelestriangle600.pdf } } ; \\endxy\\ ] ]    one can zoom in ( on - line version ) and see that both paths here actually have equal lengths according to ( [ high_energy_pythagorean_theorem ] ) . however , in the low - energy ( l.e . )",

    "the trajectory of a dirac particle is represented as a superposition of all the paths bounded by the light cone originating at an initial point and the inverse light cone terminating at some final point , for example as shown in fig .",
    "[ zigzagpathrighttrianglen6m2 ] .    furthermore , in the quantum lattice gas model , along the  hypothenuse \" ( which in the low - energy limit represents the classical straight - line path connecting the initial and final points ) , the number of bends , @xmath19 , is parametrized by the particle s mass , while the number of unbent adjacent pairs of path segments , @xmath20 , is parametrized by the particle s momentum .",
    "the greater the ratio of the momentum eigenvalue to the mass , the greater the spatial displacement .",
    "the maximal displacement for a given number of time steps @xmath21 occurs for a massless particle , so the classical path falls along the light cone . at any point ,",
    "the probability that a particle s path makes a bend is equal to @xmath22 .",
    "so the probability that the particle s path is unbent at that point is equal to @xmath23 .    to every path is assigned a probability amplitude ( c - number ) according to the rule : every pair of path segments contributes a multiplicative factor of @xmath24 if bent and @xmath25 if unbent , where the phase angle @xmath26 is determined by the momentum eigenvalue @xmath27 .",
    "hence , the phase factor @xmath28 in the nonrelativistic limit . in 1 + 1 dimensions , the quantum state at a point",
    "is represented by a 2-spinor @xmath29 and thus the local unitary update rule applied at each point is    [ qlg_steps ] @xmath30 so the unitary matrix in ( [ collide_step ] ) represents a chiral symmetry breaking interaction . to complete the specification of the quantum lattice gas algorithm ,",

    "multiple quantum particles are handled by the same evolution operator already found in the quantum algorithm for the single particle case .",

    "so , when implemented on a quantum computer , the quantum lattice gas model is an efficient quantum algorithm  the number of states needed to encode the particle dynamics grows exponentially in the number of particles , but the number of quantum gates operations remains fixed and simply proportional to the number of points in the system .",

    "one learns how the quantum lattice gas models may be implemented in a traditional digital electronic computing scheme .",
    "since they are locally computed models ( i.e. with unitary transformations occurring independently at each point in the system ) , it is clear why this class of quantum algorithms is naturally suited for classically parallel computers when the number of dirac particles in the modeled system is sufficiently small so that the hilbert space can fit into the available memory of the supercomputer .",

    "to program a quantum computer to simulate the dynamical behavior of system of dirac particles , it is necessary to specify an algorithmic protocol that represents a desired dirac hamiltonian as an engineered hermitian generator .",

    ", we consider a 1 + 1 dimensional quantum system , but its generalization to higher dimensions is straightforward .",
    "in one spatial dimension , there are two physical degrees of freedom : the dirac particle can either move to the left or to the right . thus , for a one - dimensional lattice with @xmath43 number of points , the numbered state by the ket @xmath44 where @xmath45 or @xmath10 for all @xmath46 and @xmath47 , is sufficient to represent the particle motion .",

    "kets of type ( [ position_spin_kets_for_2_qubits_per_point_d ] ) reside in the two - body subsector of the hilbert space .",
    "the notion of position and spin are intrinsically linked in this construction .",
