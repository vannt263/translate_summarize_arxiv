    "one difficulty in computing integrals is that , for large frequency @xmath3 , the classical integration methods like gauss quadrature are inapplicable , since they often require many function evaluations which make them highly time consuming . to overcome this difficulty , many efficient approaches have been developed and significant progress has occurred over the past few years . for instance , based on asymptotic expansions of as @xmath3 tends to infinity , iserles and nrsett @xcite proposed the asymptotic and filon - type methods to evaluate oscillatory integrals numerically .",

    "the interest in theoretical and numerical study of such integral transforms arises from the fact that many problems encountered in practice can be represented by an integral equation with an oscillatory kernel having a singularity of cauchy type @xcite ; see also @xcite for numerous applications of hilbert transforms in applied sciences .",
