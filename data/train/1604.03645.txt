    "the realization of heteroclinic connections as minimizing geodesics , in a sense to be described below , yields a more geometric characterization of these curves in phase space than one typically gets from minimization of @xmath19 .",
    "the considerable interest in heteroclinic connections arises in part from the central role they play in analyzing models for phase transitions , in particular time - dependent and stationary solutions to the so - called vector allen - cahn system @xmath20 and its variants , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "+ the starting point for the approach here and in @xcite is the observation that heteroclinic connections enjoy the property of equipartition of energy , namely @xmath21 consequently , viewing @xmath22 as a sum of squares , one sees that heteroclinic connections yield equality in the trivial inequality @xmath23 satisfied by any competitor , where @xmath24 this naturally leads one to consider the minimization problem @xmath25 we observe that is purely geometric , with the value of @xmath26 depending only on a curve , not on its parametrization , so one regards this as a problem of minimizing the distance between @xmath27 and @xmath28 in a degenerate riemannian metric having conformal factor @xmath29 , a metric denoted here by @xmath30 .",

    "when there are three or more potential wells , then making this logical bridge between @xmath26 minimizers and @xmath19 minimizers requires an additional assumption , namely that the minimizing geodesic joining two wells by solving does not pass through any other wells on its way .",

    "indeed , the striking rigidity of the alikakos - fusco result quoted above is surely related to the analyticity of @xmath41 in the assumption @xmath40 , in addition to its being in the planar setting .",
    "for example , we see no reason why _ local _ minimizers or even saddle points of @xmath26 or of @xmath19 should not exist for general @xmath397 having three or more zeros , leading to connections even when the ( globally ) minimizing geodesic fails to provide a heteroclinic connection because it passes through a third well .",
