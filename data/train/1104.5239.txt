    "although the case for dark matter ( dm ) is now quite convincing ( for reviews summarizing the evidence for dm , see , for example , @xcite ) , very little is yet known about its identity .",
    "the mass or masses of dark matter particles remains essentially unconstrained .",
    "aside from limits from direct detection experiments @xcite and from observations of the bullet cluster @xcite , we have essentially no data on dm interactions with itself or with the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "meanwhile , the list of possible dm candidates is extensive and includes the lightest supersymmetric particle , axions , sterile neutrinos , and kaluza - klein dm ; an extensive review of traditional dm candidates is given in @xcite .",
    "perhaps most importantly , we do not even know how many species of dark matter there are , and , even if dm is comprised of just one species of particle , we do not know whether or not that particle is just the lightest in some `` dark sector '' . in recent years",
    ", we have seen an increasing number of models with more complex dm scenarios , such as two - component dm @xcite , multicomponent dm @xcite , exciting dm @xcite , inelastic dm @xcite , and related models @xcite .",
    "given this state of affairs , it makes sense to consider models with multiple dm components or novel dm - sm interactions .",
    "at the same time , the sm leaves unanswered many questions regarding the quark and lepton flavors .",
    "although in the last few years the precision with which the elements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix are known has improved significantly @xcite , there remains a need for better understanding of the triplication of the fermion generations in the sm , or how the three fermion generations could be related through some physics beyond the sm ( bsm ) .",
    "( for reviews of quark flavor physics , see @xcite . )    here , we consider the possibility that bsm physics which controls interactions between dm and the sm fields and the new physics which explains the flavor structure of the sm may be related .",
    "we assume that dm belongs to a dark sector which contains at least two `` flavors '' of particles , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , both of which we take to be fermionic .",
    "we take @xmath2 and assume that dm is comprised of either @xmath0 or some mixture of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we will consider a wide range of dm masses , @xmath3 .    given the lack of information on dark matter interactions , and the wide range of flavor models available , we find it appropriate to consider sm - dm interactions from a phenomenological point of view , instead of trying to incorporate dm into a specific model of flavor .",
    "for this work , we concentrate on flavor interactions which involve the sm quark fields ; as an illustration here , we will concentrate mainly on @xmath4 and @xmath5 quarks .",
    "we consider two example interactions : 1 ) the case where both the sm quarks and the dm fields interact through purely vector couplings , and 2 ) where both interact through purely right - handed interactions .",
    "generically , one would expect both flavor - conserving and flavor - changing interactions ; we include both possibilities here .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows .",
    "first , in sec . [ sec : not ]",
    ", we introduce the idea of flavored dm and specify our notation and assumptions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : flav ] , we review the current constraints on flavor interactions involving dm and @xmath4 and @xmath5 quarks from low - energy measurements and collider experiments and explore implications of the relic density on the interactions of flavored dm with the sm . in sec . [",
    "sec : direct ] , we consider limits from direct - detection experiments , taking into account the possibility that the dark sector may contain more than one long - lived component .",
    "next , we present two toy models of flavor gauge interactions in sec .",
    "[ sec : toy ] .",
    "the relevance of tev - scale flavor and dm interactions to lhc is explored in sec .",
    "[ sec : lhc ] . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] , we conclude .",
    "in this section , we will specify the interactions which we will consider among @xmath5 and @xmath4 quarks and our dark sector particles @xmath0 and @xmath1 . for low - energy observables",
    ", we will primarily be interested in effective operators of the form @xmath6 which give interactions between the sm quarks and the dark sector .",
    "we will also occasionally consider the four - quark operators @xmath7 in these operators , the indices @xmath8 and @xmath9 indicate whether we are talking about @xmath0 or @xmath1 , while @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath4 on the quark fields @xmath13 indicate whether the quark flavor is @xmath5 or @xmath4 .",
    "we will assume that these flavor interactions are mediated by heavy gauge bosons ( which we will denote generically as @xmath14 ) , and , thus , we will confine our discussion to the example cases of purely vector ( @xmath15 ) interactions with @xmath16 and purely right - handed ( @xmath17 ) interactions with @xmath18 .",
    "each of these operators is multiplied by a coefficient @xmath19 ( or @xmath20 ) where @xmath21 is taken to be some high new physics scale .",
    "as we assume that the sm and dm share a common flavor interaction , we expect these operators to have similar scales .",
    "however , the operator coefficients may also contain small mixing angles ; in the sm weak interaction , these small mixing angles cause the effective scales between different four - quark operators to differ by more than @xmath22 orders of magnitude . here",
    ", we will keep all of our results in terms of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "for some parts of this analysis , we will have to also consider possible interactions involving other quark fields . in the case of vector interactions",
    ", we must include both right - handed quarks ( which are singlets under the sm @xmath23 weak interaction ) , as well as the left - handed @xmath23 doublets ; this necessarily requires that we also consider up - type quarks , weighted by the appropriate angles of the ckm matrix .",
    "additionally , the interactions we have specified above , if taken in isolation or without careful arrangement of quantum numbers , lead to anomalies in triangle diagrams involving the @xmath14s and the sm gauge bosons ; however , as the choice of quantum numbers for the sm and dark sector fields needed to cancel these anomalies is not unique , we will not consider these additional interactions throughout most of this paper .",
    "finally , among the operators included in eq .",
    "( [ eq : opstruct1 ] ) , there exist some ( @xmath24 and their hermitian conjugates ) which change strangeness by two units , and , thus , can contribute to @xmath25 mixing .",
    "constraints on the effective new physics scale for these operators are @xmath26 @xcite",
    ". as we are interested in effects which may be observed at lhc or dm direct detection experiments , our analysis will only be applicable to flavor models which do not have tree - level contributions to @xmath27 mixing . in sec .",
    "[ sec : toy ] , we will present two toy models , one with right - handed couplings and one with vector couplings , which are anomaly - free and which do not contribute to @xmath27 mixing at tree level .",
    "in this section , we will review some of the relevant measurements which constrain bsm flavor interactions involving @xmath4 and @xmath5 quarks with each other and with the dark sector particles @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we begin with constraints obtainable from low - energy observables .",
    "we first consider the case where the @xmath0 ( and possibly also the @xmath1 ) is very light , @xmath28 mev . in this case",
    ", we would expect to have the decay @xmath29 ( and possibly decays to final states containing @xmath1 or @xmath30 as well ) .",
    "thus , considering the branching fraction of @xmath31 to a @xmath32 plus neutrinos @xcite @xmath33 and taking the @xmath34 bound on this measurement as a limit on the branching fraction to @xmath35 , and taking the ratio of this branching fraction to that of the sm process @xmath36 , we obtain , for purely right - handed interactions , @xmath37 for @xmath38 ( and possibly also @xmath39 ) @xmath40 .",
    "we can also consider the case where @xmath0 is very light , but @xmath39 is somewhat heavier , by comparing to the sm process @xmath41 , obtaining @xmath42 for @xmath43 .",
    "( here , we assume that the limit on @xmath29 is not substantially degraded when one of the final - state dark sector particles acquires a mass of @xmath44 . )",
    "we see from these bounds that the case of very light @xmath0 is very strongly constrained .",
    "( although in both cases here we assumed that @xmath0 was very light , @xmath45 mev , we can infer from the strength of these constraints that we would still obtain significant bounds on the new physics scale for all cases in which @xmath31 decay was not strongly phase - space suppressed . )",
    "the limits derived here are only applicable to the operators @xmath46 as shown above ( and , unless @xmath47 , only to the case where both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are light ) . as interaction and mass eigenstates need not coincide , we may be tempted to interpret these results as a tentative order - of - magnitude estimate of expected bounds on the new physics scale for the operators @xmath48 and @xmath49 as well ; however , small mixing angles ( @xmath50 ) can easily invalidate this interpretation .",
    "our results are similar for the case of vector interactions , @xmath51 for the case where both final - state dark sector particles are light , and @xmath52 for the case where one is light and the other has a mass of @xmath44 . in this case , however , because vector interactions with quarks necessarily involve the left - handed quark doublets , and because the interaction eigenstates in the left - handed doublets differ from the mass eigenstates by a rotation via the cabibbo angle @xmath53 , the operators @xmath54 necessarily involve some significant quark mixing .",
    "since we have no good reason to believe that the interaction eigenstates would be aligned with the _ down - type _ quarks , it therefore may be more compelling in this case to interpret the bounds on @xmath55 as a tentative bound on the @xmath56 cases as well .",
    "we note that one can also obtain limits on the right - handed operators for the case @xmath57 from limits on supernova cooling , assuming that @xmath58 .",
    "we can apply the limit on the branching fraction @xmath59 @xcite to the case of a light @xmath0 . for @xmath60",
    ", we obtain limits on the new physics scale of order @xmath61 tev",
    ". however , as the decay @xmath62 is helicity - suppressed , this limit quickly degrades with decreasing @xmath38 .",
    "similar statements apply in the case that one or both final - state particles is an @xmath1 .",
    "we now move on the the case of heavier @xmath0",
    ". we will first consider constraints which can be obtained from @xmath25 mixing .",
    "as we limit ourselves to models which have no tree - level contribution to @xmath25 mixing , we will only concern ourselves with contributions from the diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kaonmix ] .",
    "( in the case of vector interactions , there are also loop diagrams containing up - type quarks which can contribute to @xmath25 mixing .",
    "we will briefly discuss these contributions when we consider toy models in sec .",

    "first , we will consider operators which change flavor on both the sm and dark sector fields .",
    "for a right - handed interaction , we have @xmath64 while for a vector interaction , we have @xmath65 first , we note that these interactions , taken in isolation , do not contribute to the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : kaonmix ] ; the @xmath0 created in one of the vertices in the loop would have to transform into an @xmath1 before it is destroyed at the other vertex .",
    "however , we note that , in general , we would not expect the interaction eigenstates in the dark sector to necessarily coincide with the mass eigenstates @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    ". we can introduce interaction eigenstates @xmath66 and @xmath67 , related to @xmath0 and @xmath1 by @xmath68 where @xmath69 and , in the case of the right - handed interaction , the fields in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mix ] ) are taken to be the right - handed components only .",
    "( here , we assume that @xmath70 do not mix with any other states . )",
    "we can now place limits on combinations of the coefficients @xmath71 , the parameters @xmath72 and @xmath73 which control the mixing , and the mass splitting , @xmath74 . in the case of right - handed interactions , the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : kaonmix ] is finite ; we obtain , for the mass difference between @xmath75 and @xmath76 , @xmath77 where @xmath78 mev is the kaon decay constant and @xmath79 is a constant which depends on the relative size of @xmath38 and @xmath39 ; for @xmath80 , @xmath81 , while , for @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "we can then compare this to the experimental value @xmath84 gev @xcite ; for @xmath85 , we obtain upper bounds on @xmath86 of approximately @xmath87 gev .",
    "we get a similar order - of - magnitude expression for the case of vector interactions , @xmath88 where the logarithmic behavior comes from the running of @xmath89 between the new physics scale and @xmath39 induced by the diagram in fig . [",
    "fig : kaonmix ] .",
    "for @xmath90 , this gives an upper bound on @xmath91 of @xmath92 gev .",
    "here , we have taken the logarithmic factor in the vector case to be of order unity , but we note that the upper bound on @xmath91 can be strengthened considerably if @xmath0 and @xmath1 are very light . thus , we see that fairly small mass splittings are phenomenologically interesting in these scenarios .",
    "we also briefly consider the operators which do not change dark sector flavor .",
    "for both the right - handed and vector interactions , the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : kaonmix ] will be quadratically divergent . if we regulate this divergence using dimensional regularization , we find that the contribution to @xmath93 from the operator for the right - handed case , @xmath94 will contain factors of @xmath38 instead of @xmath95 and , thus , this operator will be more strongly constrained than the operators which change dark sector flavor as long as @xmath38 is substantially larger than @xmath95",
    ". the analogous vector operator , on the other hand , will contain factors of @xmath96 instead of @xmath95 or @xmath38 ; the scale for this operator will be constrained to be at least @xmath97 .",
    "we also mention that the limits derived from @xmath93 above depend only on the magnitude of @xmath98 , not its phase . however , the cp - violation parameter @xmath99 is sensitive to a complex phase in the kaon mixing matrix , which depends on @xmath98 .",
    "depending on the choice of these phases , the upper bound on @xmath100 could be strengthened by more than an order of magnitude for a given value of @xmath21 .",
    "we briefly mention relevant collider bounds .",
    "cdf @xcite has directly looked for heavy neutral gauge bosons , @xmath14 , decaying to jets .",
    "they have excluded the mass range of @xmath101 gev , assuming sm couplings .",
    "( for limits on lighter @xmath14 gauge bosons , see results from ua2 @xcite . )",
    "however , these limits can be easily evaded by making the couplings between the quarks and the @xmath14 slightly smaller than those in the sm .",
    "additionally , indirect limits on specific flavor models from fits to collider data were given in @xcite .",
    "finally , we consider constraints obtained from the observed dm density of @xmath102 @xcite . if dm consists of only one species , obtaining the correct relic density requires a velocity - averaged annihilation cross - section at freezeout @xmath103 of @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the relative speed of dm particles , with a mild dependence on @xmath38 .",
    "as long as @xmath106 , each of our purely right - handed operators will contribute a term @xmath107 to the annihilation cross - section @xmath108 .",
    "( here , we have neglected velocity - dependent terms . )",
    "this gives a value for the sum of the squares of the operator coefficients , @xmath109 we see that the new physics scale decreases with decreasing @xmath38 .",
    "we note , however , that , if we allow @xmath0 to comprise only a fraction of dm ( and thus have a smaller relic density ) , we can allow larger values for @xmath103 , and thus lower values for the new physics scale .",
    "thus , if we have only one operator with a nonzero coefficient , say , @xmath110 , then @xmath111 tev should be regarded as an approximate _ upper _ bound on the new physics scale .",
    "( note that all of our other constraints place _ lower _ bounds on the scale of new physics . )",
    "of course , this upper bound on the scale of new physics can be raised by having additional terms with nonzero coefficients in the sum shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : relr ] ) , so this should not be taken as a rigorous upper bound on the np scale .",
    "we get a similar term @xmath112 for the operators with purely vector interactions . here",
    ", we have included a factor of @xmath22 in the cross - section , as gauge invariance demands that we include both the upper and lower components of the left - handed quark doublets .",
    "this gives @xmath113    we note that our relic density calculations assume the simplest scenario for dm self - annihilation @xmath114 .",
    "if @xmath0 and @xmath1 have masses which differ by only a few percent or less , the more complicated coannihilation calculation @xcite is relevant ; coannihilations can significantly reduce the relic density of @xmath0 , and thus loosen the limits in ( [ eq : relr ] ) and ( [ eq : rell ] ) , if the annihilation cross - section for @xmath115 is substantially larger than that for @xmath35 . additionally , this calculation also neglects the possibility of other annihilation channels for @xmath35 , which can substantially raise the new physics scale .",
    "we now discuss the prospects for direct detection of flavored dm .",
    "we will distinguish between two experimentally distinct cases , depending on the mass splitting @xmath95 . in the first case , @xmath116 .",
    "( the range of masses given here reflects the difference between the right - handed and vector operators . ) in this case , @xmath0 is the only long - lived particle in the dark sector , and it interacts elastically with nucleons , @xmath117 . in the second case , as we will show below , it is possible that the heavier state @xmath1 can also be long - lived and form a sizable component of dm , thus allowing exothermic down - scattering of the form @xmath118 .",
    "( additionally , for @xmath119 kev , up - scattering of the form @xmath120 becomes possible , thus making flavored dm a possible example of inelastic dark matter @xcite , introduced to possibly explain the apparent conflict between dama @xcite and other experiments .",
    "although this scenario is significantly constrained @xcite , it remains a viable possibility for explaining the dama results if @xmath121 @xcite . presumably requires significant fine - tuning of mixing angles ; @xcite utilize inelastic scattering cross - sections which are @xmath122 orders of magnitude larger than the elastic scattering cross - sections ruled out by @xcite to address the dama results .",
    "this does not preclude , however , the existence of inelastic scattering with much smaller cross - sections , which could require less fine - tuning of mixing angles . ] )    first , we will discuss the case where @xmath95 is sufficiently large that @xmath1 is not long - lived , and dm can interact in direct detection experiments only through the elastic reaction @xmath123 . in this case , we can directly apply the constraints from existing dm experiments ; here , we will only consider spin - independent contributions to the cross - section , as they are significantly more strongly constrained than spin - dependent contributions . as direct detection experiments search for interactions between dm and nucleons , we are interested in operators which contain @xmath4 quarks ( and @xmath124 quarks , in the case of vector interactions ) .",
    "for the purely right - handed interactions , the measured spin - independent dm - nucleon cross - section takes the form @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the reduced mass of the dm - nucleon system and @xmath79 and @xmath127 are the atomic mass number and atomic number of the target nucleus , respectively .",
    "the dependence on @xmath79 and @xmath127 takes into account the fact that limits from dm direct - detection experiments assume that the cross - sections for dm scattering on protons and neutrons are equal ; @xmath0 interacts only with @xmath4 quarks , and not @xmath124 quarks ; thus , the cross - section for a neutron is four times that of a proton . for the purely vector interactions we have @xmath128 where the factor of @xmath129 includes the contributions from both @xmath124 and @xmath4 quarks .",
    "( as @xmath0 interacts identically with @xmath124 and @xmath4 quarks , the cross - sections here are the same for protons and neutrons ; we ignore corrections due to the cabibbo angle . )",
    "we can compare these expressions to the cross - section limits from direct detection experiments ; here we will assume that all of dm is comprised of @xmath0 .",
    "we consider three specific values for @xmath38 .",
    "for the cogent signal region , @xmath130 gev @xcite , we take @xmath131 ( although this is in conflict with @xcite ) . for @xmath132 tev and the range of dm masses where these limits are strongest , @xmath133",
    ", we use the results from xenon100 @xcite , who report a spin - independent cross - section upper bound for these mass ranges of @xmath134 and @xmath135 , respectively .",
    "our results are shown in table [ table : dir ] .",
    ".results for the new physics scale from dm direct detection experiments .",
    "the first line refers to np scale corresponding to the cogent signal region @xcite , while the last two are lower bounds on the np scale obtained from the results of xenon100 @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     under the assumption that our particle @xmath0 comprises all of dm and couples to first - generation quarks , the constraints from direct detection are quite strong ; in particular , in the case of vector couplings , only a very light @xmath0 would possibly be observable at lhc .",
    "however , considerations of the relic density indicate that additional interactions may be necessary ; these additional interactions may introduce new signatures at lhc .",
    "thus , it may be fruitful to attempt to incorporate flavored dm into a more complete model .",
    "if such a model contained multiple types of dm , the constraints on couplings to first - generation quarks from direct detection could also be loosened , opening up additional parameter space accessible at lhc .",
    "finally , we note that we have confined ourselves to interactions involving @xmath4 and @xmath5 quarks ( plus @xmath124 and @xmath12 quarks where necessary ) , and have limited ourselves to purely right - handed and purely vector couplings .",
    "however , we would like to point out that the range of flavor interactions which could potentially be applied to dm is immense",
    ". one could consider scalar interactions , interactions with leptons , and , perhaps most interestingly , interactions involving the third family of quarks .",

    "<S> we consider the possibility that dark matter can communicate with the standard model fields via flavor interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we take the dark matter to belong to a `` dark sector '' which contains at least two types , or `` flavors '' , of particles and then hypothesize that the standard model fields and dark matter share a common interaction which depends on flavor . as , generically , interaction eigenstates and mass eigenstates need not coincide , we consider both flavor - changing and flavor - conserving interactions . </S>",
    "<S> these interactions are then constrained by meson decays , kaon mixing , and current collider bounds , and we examine their relevance for direct detection and lhc . </S>"
