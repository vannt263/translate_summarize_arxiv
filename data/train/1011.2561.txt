    "nuclear @xmath0-ray line emission induced by interactions of energetic particles with the solar atmosphere is commonly observed from eruptive solar events like solar flares .",
    "the bulk of this emission is due to reactions of accelerated protons , @xmath7he and @xmath1 particles with abundant nuclei of the solar atmosphere and reactions of energetic heavy ions with ambient hydrogen and helium . in both populations , ambient and energetic , the most important nuclei heavier than he are usually the major isotopes of elements c , n , o , ne , mg",
    ", si and fe . de - excitation lines of all those nuclei ( except @xmath4n ) have already been observed from solar flares .",
    "the intensities of prominent narrow lines induced by energetic light ions allow determination of ambient abundances and of the composition and energy spectra of accelerated light particles @xcite .",
    "a thorough line - shape analysis may furthermore reveal directional distributions of the accelerated particles @xcite .",
    "the same prominent lines are also expected from energetic heavy ions interacting with ambient h and he , but are much broader because of the relatively high velocities of the emitting nuclei .",
    "their analysis is , however , much more difficult because the broad lines are merged into a quasi - continuum component of numerous unresolved weak lines .",
    "a successful extraction of these lines would inform about the composition , energy spectra and directional distribution of the accelerated heavy - ion component @xcite .",
    "similar @xmath0-ray line emissions featuring the same prominent narrow and broad lines as well as the weak - line quasi - continuum are expected from the interaction of galactic cosmic rays with the interstellar gas and dust @xcite .",
    "such an emission is probably dominated by the low - energy part of the cosmic - ray energy spectrum .",
    "searches for nuclear @xmath0-ray lines from nearby molecular clouds like the orion molecular cloud or the galactic center and galactic thin disk have not been successful up to date .",
    "their eventual detection would bring enormous progress for our knowledge of the low - energy cosmic - ray component . at the moment , practically nothing is known about the cosmic - ray composition and spectrum below a few hundred mev per nucleon because these particles are effectively deflected by magnetic fields which are carried by the outstreaming solar wind and do not reach the inner heliosphere .",
    "interpretation of observed @xmath0-ray spectra requires a large amount of nuclear cross section data . for line intensities ,",
    "@xmath0-ray production cross sections are needed from reaction threshold to typically hundred mev per nucleon for solar flares and to hundreds of mev per nucleon for cosmic - ray interactions . to this purpose",
    "a database has been built , initiated in 1979 by ramaty , kozlovsky and lingenfelter @xcite and successively updated @xcite .",
    "the last version @xcite contains cross section excitation functions for the production of 181 different @xmath0-ray lines , essentially from proton and @xmath1-particle reactions with nuclei from he to fe and from some @xmath7he - induced reactions .",
    "the excitation functions cover the range from reaction threshold up to typically several hundred mev per nucleon .    for most of these lines",
    "experimental cross sections exist at projectile energies below 25 mev for protons and 40 mev for @xmath1 particles .",
    "many of them were measured at the tandem accelerators in washington @xcite and orsay @xcite .",
    "for some lines cross sections are available at higher energies from cyclotron laboratories @xcite .",
    "cross section interpolations and extrapolations to higher energies are based on nuclear reaction systematics and calculations with nuclear reaction codes like talys @xcite .",
    "all other , presumably , weaker lines not explicitely listed in @xcite and probably to be counted in tens of thousands are supposed to form the above mentionend quasi - continuum . for this component cross sections in @xcite are entirely from talys predictions .",
    "we decided to extend the database for proton and @xmath1-particle reactions with two abundant elements of the solar atmosphere n and ne , for which @xmath0-ray production cross sections are only available for a few lines .",
    "reactions with neon make probably an important contribution to the weak - line quasi - continuum in solar flares and in cosmic - ray interactions .",
    "nitrogen is also very important for the understanding of the @xmath0-ray emission of earth s atmosphere induced by interactions of cosmic rays and solar energetic particles .",
    "furthermore we measured the @xmath0-ray production from proton reactions with si at three energies in order to extend the cross section database and test the nuclear reaction calculations for this element which is very important for the weak - line quasi - continuum component .",
    "line shape modeling needs differential cross sections for the emitting nucleus , the @xmath0-ray and correlations between them . at relatively low projectile energies ( @xmath8 @xmath9 15 mev ) ,",
    "compound nucleus resonances and interferences with the direct reaction mechanism make nuclear reaction calculations very difficult .",
    "simultaneous fits of measured line shapes at different laboratory angles to obtain a parameter set for line - shape calculations is in this situation probably the only alternative . up to now this has been done in detail only for the 4.438-mev line of @xmath10c @xcite and has been subsequently used to analyse this line in the @xmath0-ray spectra of solar flares @xcite .",
    "therefore we decided to measure the line shapes for another nuclear de - excitation line , the 6.129-mev line of @xmath2o .",
    "this line has been chosen for two reasons : ( 1 ) it is usually one of the strongest de - excitation lines in solar flares ; ( 2 ) @xmath2o has only few @xmath0-ray emitting levels which reduces the importance of @xmath0-ray cascades and facilitates the line - shape calculations .",
    "the experiment is described in section ii ; obtained results for @xmath0-ray line shapes and production cross sections are reported in section iii where they are compared with previously reported data .",
    "a comparison of experimental data to nuclear reaction code calculations is presented in section iv .",
    "the experiment has been done at the tandem van - de - graaff accelerator of the ipn orsay .",
    "proton beams in the energy range 6.55 - 26.2 mev and @xmath1-particle beams in the range 7.5 - 39.2 mev passed through a gas cell containing the target elements ne , n , and o , where all employed gases were of natural isotopic composition . three different molecular gases were used for the irradiation of n and o. a n@xmath11o gas target was used for studying lines produced by reactions of low - energy proton and @xmath1-particle beams with @xmath4n and @xmath2o . at energies where spallation reactions of @xmath2o may produce @xmath4n lines , n@xmath11 and co@xmath11",
    "were used separately for measurements on @xmath4n and @xmath2o , respectively . for the irradiations of si with proton beams of 10 , 15 and 20 mev we used a 21.1 mg/@xmath12 thick foil of si of natural isotopic composition placed at the center of the empty gas cell .",
    "the gas cell has been built as a 13 cm long aluminium cylinder of 3.8 cm inner diameter .",
    "two narrower sections were placed on both ends of the cylinder , each of them holding a 6 @xmath13 m thick mylar foil .",
    "these sections had 12 and 20 mm diameter at the beam entrance and exit , respectively .",
    "the total length of the cell between the two foils was 18.7 cm .",
    "three gas bottles were connected to the cell by individual gas dosing valves and an oil - free vacuum pump was connected by a standard manual valve . for each irradiation run the gas cell",
    "was filled by manual operation with the required gas and pressure .",
    "the gas pressure was chosen following a compromise between reasonably high @xmath0-ray yield and small energy loss and angular straggling .",
    "it was measured with a piezo - electric vacuum gauge with an acurracy of better than 0.25% and cell temperature was determined to better than 0.5 @xmath14c .",
    "both values were noted before and after each irradiation run .",
    "typical gas column densities and energy losses of the projectile for the different irradiation runs are listed in table [ table_runs ] .",
    "a faraday cup was placed approximately 1.5 m downstream of the gas cell for the beam current determination .",
    "it consisted of an electrically isolated stainless steel tube of 75 cm length with an end cap of al .",
    "a thick pb absorber was placed around the faraday cup to reduce the @xmath0-ray and neutron fluxes originating in the cup towards the detection setup .",
    "typical beam currents were 1 - 4 na and typical irradiation times 15 - 30 minutes .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty of the beam charge determination to less than 5% .",
    "beam position and size were checked for each new energy by means of beam - induced fluorescence of an alumina target situated approximately 1 m upstream of the gas target .",
    "the typical beam spot size was less than 5 mm diameter .",
    "a further fine tuning of the beam was achieved by minimizing the @xmath0-ray lines of @xmath15al at 843 , 1014 and 2211 kev which were probably due to interactions between the beam and the sections holding the mylar foils",
    ". a further check of beam transmission through the gas cell was possible by comparison of the beam currents in a faraday cup upstream and the faraday cup downstream of the gas cell .",
    "both currents agreed typically to better than 5% .",
    "for each beam energy we made a run with the gas cell being empty ( p @xmath8 0.1 mbar ) in order to measure the beam - induced @xmath0-ray background component which is dominated by interactions in the mylar foils and the faraday end cap .",
    "we made also several runs without beam to determine the room background .",
    "@xmath0 rays were detected with four ge detectors equipped with bgo shields for compton suppression .",
    "two segmented clover detectors vega from the euroball setup @xcite were placed at angles of 120@xmath3 and 135@xmath3 with respect to the beam direction and at 40 cm from the centre of the gas cell .",
    "another clover detector - a prototype of the exogam setup @xcite - and a single coaxial ge detector from the eurogam phase i setup @xcite were situated at 90@xmath3 and 20 cm and at 30@xmath3 and 17.5 cm from the gas target , respectively .",
    "we took data for the 13 individual crystals with standard nim electronics and the data acquisition system narval @xcite .",
    "the count rates for each crystal were below 15 khz and the corresponding acquisition dead times smaller than 25% .",
    "note that the dead - time correction is done for each crystal separately , which is a specific feature of the used acquisition system narval @xcite .",
    "uncertainties on acquisition dead times were estimated in the analyses of isotropic @xmath0-ray angular distributions to be less than 3% .",
    "figure [ figspec ] shows a typical spectrum for proton irradiation of n@xmath11o at e@xmath16 = 10.23 mev . at this energy the 4.438-mev line of @xmath10c can essentially only be produced by proton inelastic scattering off @xmath10c present in the mylar foils , proton - induced reactions on @xmath4n or @xmath2o feeding the first excited state of @xmath10c being ineffective .",
    "after subtraction of the empty - gas - cell run the spectrum is ( beneath a strong 511-kev line ) largely dominated by lines from @xmath4n and @xmath2o .",
    "some relatively weak background lines are also observed , most probably from proton interactions with the al tube of the narrow section at the gas cell exit .",
    "as these lines are much weaker in the empty gas cell runs and the beam optics remained unchanged this background is certainly due to angular straggling in the gas .",
    "neutron interactions within material close to the detectors which is essentially made of al may also contribute , where neutrons are essentially from the ( p , n ) reaction on @xmath4n .",
    "the efficiency calibration of the detection setup was done with the help of geant @xcite simulations and radioactive sources of @xmath17eu and @xmath18co .",
    "both sources were successively placed at five different positions on the gas cell axis covering the beam path inside the gas .",
    "these measurements in the range e@xmath19 = 0.2 - 1.4 mev were used to normalize the efficiency curves in the range 0.2 - 10 mev obtained in detailed geant simulations of the detection setup .",
    "the efficiency of the experimental setup was then taken as the average of the normalized efficiency curves for the five different positions on the gas cell axis .",
    "a more detailed description of the experiment and calibrations can be found in @xcite .",
    "all results have been obtained with the compton - suppressed spectra of the individual crystals of the three clover and the single coaxial detector .",
    "we subtracted systematically the spectra resulting from the irradiation runs with empty gas cell with a normalization following the dead - time corrected beam charges .",
    "an accurate subtraction was particularly important for irradiations where the same lines were produced in both the gas and the mylar foils . due to the c and o content of mylar ( chemical composition c@xmath20h@xmath21o@xmath22 ) , it concerned all measurements of the 6.129-mev line shape and the measurements of @xmath4n lines at projectile energies where fusion - evaporation reactions with @xmath10c and @xmath2o can populate excited states in @xmath4n .",
    "the total uncertainty in the subtraction was estimated to be less than 10% , composed of a combined uncertainty of 7.5% for the two charge measurements of the runs with and without gas and less than 3% for the dead - time determination .",
    "an independent check of this uncertainty was possible by comparing the intensities of the 4.438-mev line in the irradiation runs at low projectile energies .",
    "in fact this line was produced in the runs below e@xmath16 @xmath23 10 mev and e@xmath24 @xmath23 15 mev exclusively by inelastic scattering off @xmath10c present in the mylar foils , because fusion - evaporation reactions with @xmath4n and @xmath2o of the n@xmath11o gas populating the first excited state of @xmath10c are energetically forbidden .",
    "the relative intensities of the 4.438-mev line agreed typically to within 10% with the relative beam charges of the runs with and without gas .    at higher projectile energies",
    "the 4.438-mev line is also produced in the n@xmath11 and co@xmath11 gases by reactions with @xmath4n and with @xmath10c and @xmath2o , respectively , but we extracted neither line shapes nor cross sections for it . for the latter two isotopes , a comprehensive data set of high - statistics line shapes and cross sections with probably better accuracy than could have been extracted from this experiment exists already . in reactions with @xmath4n production cross sections for the 4.438-mev line",
    "are much smaller than for inelastic scattering off @xmath10c , such that the subtraction introduced an important uncertainty at many projectile energies , not allowing for a reasonable determination of the excitation function .",
    "the intensities of @xmath0 rays produced by proton interactions with oxygen of the mylar foils were generally much smaller than the ones for interactions within the gas , due to the small surface density of the mylar foils with respect to the gas .",
    "a typical situation can be seen for the spectrum on fig .",
    "[ figspec ] where the contribution of the mylar foil is remarkable only for the 4.438-mev line . due to",
    "the lower gas pressures in the @xmath1-particle runs , the contribution of the mylar foils to the @xmath2o lines was more important and reached up to 60% for runs with n@xmath11o gas at low @xmath1-particle energies .",
    "this affected the 6.129-mev line shape , but not the cross section determination for the @xmath4n lines because neither the @xmath10c(@xmath1,x)@xmath4n nor the @xmath2o(@xmath1,x)@xmath4n reaction channels were open .",
    "considering typical abundances and cross sections the 6.129-mev line is in astrophysical sources like solar flares essentially produced by inelastic scattering off @xmath2o . for harder energetic - particle spectra like galactic cosmic rays spallation of @xmath25ne may play a small role on the order of 10% .",
    "other reactions like @xmath1-particle induced fusion - evaporation reactions with @xmath4n are in most cases completely negligible .",
    "two models for the calculation of the 6.129-mev line profiles in astrophysical sources , in particular solar flares , have been published : first , astrophysically motivated models applicable to general inelastic scattering reactions have been proposed in @xcite .",
    "they employed energy - dependent few - parameter descriptions of the scattering and @xmath0-ray emission process .",
    "later on @xcite and @xcite developed models based on optical - model calculations for the 4.438 and 6.129-mev line shapes .",
    "this was used for the analysis of the spectra of 19 solar flares observed by smm @xcite and of three solar flares observed by the high - resolution ge spectrometer spi onboard integral @xcite . in all models , however , the complete lack of measured line shapes for the 6.129-mev line introduced a substantial uncertainty in the calculations .",
    "this should be especially important at low energies where individual compound - nucleus resonances dominate the inelastic scattering reactions which are certainly not well described by optical - model calculations or general parameterizations .",
    "we extracted line shapes for the most important reaction p + @xmath2o for 15 different proton energies in the range e@xmath16 = 6.55 - 12.83 mev with small steps of 0.3 - 0.5 mev .",
    "beam energies and gas densities were chosen to obtain a neat coverage of the complete energy range when considering the energy losses in the gas ( see table [ table_runs ] ) . in the range e@xmath16 = 13.5 - 26.2 mev ,",
    "isolated compound nucleus resonances are less important and 6 different proton energies with larger energy steps of 1.5 - 3.7 mev appeared sufficient to check the optical model calculations . a similar energy coverage was used for @xmath1-particle reactions with @xmath2o : small energy steps of 0.5 mev and neat coverage for e@xmath24 = 7.0 - 10 mev and larger steps of 1 - 5 mev up to 39.2 mev .    in order to increase statistics",
    ", we created three new spectra by summing the individual background - subtracted spectra of the four crystals of each clover detector .",
    "this resulted in four spectra for each irradiation run , with at least two line profiles of good statistics ( typically more than 10000 counts ) from the vega clover detectors .",
    "spectra of the single coaxial and the exogam clover detector had lower statistics due to lower detection efficiency at 6 mev .",
    "we then subtracted the background below the 6.129-mev line which was essentially due to remaining compton scattering events of higher - energy @xmath0-ray lines ( 6.915 and 7.115 mev of @xmath2o and 6.445 and 7.027 mev of @xmath4n ) which were not suppressed by a veto signal of the bgo shields . for the subtraction we used the results of the geant simulations of the detection setup .",
    "examples of 6.129-mev line shapes in proton reactions and results of calculations are shown in figs .",
    "[ prof_20mev ] and [ prof_10mev ] . at e@xmath16 = 20 mev",
    "one expects the direct reaction mechanism to dominate inelastic scattering to the j@xmath26=3@xmath27 , 6.130-mev state of @xmath2o .",
    "optical model calculations should then reasonably well reproduce the @xmath0-ray angular distributions and line shapes .",
    "an example is shown on fig .",
    "[ prof_20mev ] , where the line shape calculation has been done with the same coupled - channels calculations which were used for the analysis of the solar flares observed by spi / integral @xcite . a good reproduction of the relative intensities and line shapes at the four detection angles is observed , except maybe at 30@xmath3 .",
    "again , as expected , the optical model calculations from @xcite fail to reproduce the line shapes at low energies .",
    "this is illustrated on fig .",
    "[ prof_10mev ] for e@xmath16 = 10.23 mev where the predictions of the direct reaction mechanism alone are clearly incompatible with the data . at this projectile energy",
    "several known resonances in @xmath28f can be populated which may contribute to the 6.129-mev line production .",
    "we finally found a good reproduction of the relative line intensities and the shapes assuming a pure 5/2@xmath29 compound - nucleus resonance in @xmath28f decaying to @xmath2o@xmath30(j@xmath26=3@xmath27 , 6.130 mev ) by l=1 proton emission with a possible small contribution of the direct reaction mechanism of the order of 10% .",
    "the explicit inclusion of compound - nucleus resonances at low energies improves here considerably the quality of line - shape calculations which has also been observed in the case of the 4.438 mev @xmath10c line @xcite .",
    "similar findings hold also for the 6.129-mev line in @xmath1-particle inelastic scattering .",
    "a complete description of line shapes in inelastic scattering , however , including resonances and direct reactions plus eventually the contribution of spallation reactions is out of the scope of this paper .",
    "it will be presented elsewhere @xcite including also a reevaluation of the 4.438-mev line for which we have new data from threshold to 25 mev for proton reactions and to 37.5 mev for @xmath1-particle reactions @xcite .",
    "differential cross sections for @xmath0-ray lines emitted in the proton and @xmath1-particle induced reactions with n , ne and si were deduced from the line integrals of the 13 background - subtracted spectra . in most cases the lines were isolated and a simple integration of line counts with subtraction of the compton background was sufficient . for the 5.105-mev line of @xmath4n superposition with the second escape peak of the 6.129-mev line had to be taken into account for proton irradiations with n@xmath11o gas and for alpha - particle irradiations with n@xmath11o and n@xmath11 .",
    "lines that were not clearly standing out or sitting above a complicated background were not considered for analysis .",
    "we concentrated furthermore on lines produced by inelastic scattering .",
    "uncertainties on the differential cross section data include the statistical uncertainty , and uncertainties due to background subtraction , dead - time correction and relative detection efficiency .",
    "the uncertainties of the dead - time correction and relative efficiencies were estimated to be smaller than 3% and 5% , respectively , the latter one depending on the @xmath0-ray line energy .",
    "for the background subtraction we made , for each line integral , an estimation of the minimal and maximal background and took as the corresponding uncertainty half of the difference .",
    "all uncertainties were added quadratically .    in each clover detector , the crystals were arranged such that we had only two independent angles with respect to the beam direction .",
    "the data of the two crystals at the same angle were then averaged for the differential cross section .",
    "the @xmath0-ray production cross sections were obtained by legendre - polynomial fits to the differential cross sections :    @xmath31    with @xmath32 being the smaller of twice the @xmath0-ray transition multipolarity or twice the spin of the emitting state .",

    "all cross sections can safely be attributed to reactions with @xmath4n within the given cross section uncertainties .    in proton reactions we determined cross section excitation functions for 11 lines of @xmath4n produced by inelastic scattering .",
    "they are from transitions of the first 8 excited states in the range e@xmath38 = 2.313 - 7.029 mev . actually , we have at least one transition for each of these states , except for the j@xmath26=0@xmath27 , 4.915 mev state .",

    "the strongest line up to e@xmath16 = 20 mev is the 2.313-mev line from the first excited state transition .",
    "due to the spin 0 of the emitting state the @xmath0-ray angular distribution is isotropic . as it was also a prominent line in the spectra well above background and with good statistics it was very useful to check our relative detector efficiencies and dead - time corrections .",

    "applications of measured @xmath0-ray cross sections in modeling of astrophysical phenomena like solar flares or galactic cosmic rays is not straightforward and usually requires some preparation of the data . in both cases",
    "cross section excitation functions are needed from reaction threshold to energies of typically hundred mev per nucleon for solar flares and to hundreds of mev per nucleon for cosmic rays .",
    "a sufficiently complete set of experimental data to define the whole excitation function in the required energy range exists for practically no @xmath0-ray line .",
    "some theoretical input like nuclear reaction calculations is therefore essential for the modeling of @xmath0-ray emissions in astrophysical sites .",
    "modern nuclear reactions codes like empire @xcite and talys @xcite have recently been used for such purposes .",
    "empire has been successfully employed reproducing cross sections of strong lines in proton and @xmath1-particle reactions with @xmath10c , @xmath2o , @xmath49 mg and fe measured at the orsay tandem @xcite .",
    "both codes have been used for the calculation of delayed @xmath0-ray lines emitted by radioactive ions produced during solar flares @xcite .",
    "talys has been chosen to complement cross section evaluations in the latest version of the @xmath0-ray cross section database for astrophysical applications @xcite . there , in particular , many cross section excitation functions of lines produced in @xmath1-particle reactions have been updated to include an important contribution of fusion - evaporation reactions like ( @xmath1,pnd ) and ( @xmath1,2p2n ) which produce the same lines as inelastic scattering ( @xmath1,@xmath1 ) and which had been neglected in the former versions .",
    "another important point for calculations is the quasi - continuum of thousands of weak lines produced in astrophysical sites for which no experimental cross sections exist .",
    "we chose to compare talys predictions with our data for @xmath4n , ne and si lines .",
    "talys is a user - friendly code providing nuclear reaction calculations for @xmath0 , n , p , d , t , @xmath50he and @xmath1-particle induced reactions in the energy range e@xmath51 = 1 kev - 250 mev @xcite . the major reaction mechanisms in this range are included , otherwise talys uses comprehensive libraries for the optical potentials , deformations , discrete levels and level densities , masses etc .",
    "for most of the nuclear data the code offers a choice of values derived from experiment and from different theoretical models .",
    "the user can also input his own values by a set of keywords or simply edit the libraries .",
    "a first comparison was simply done with calculations using the default values of talys which have shown good agreement with experimental data for lines from transitions of the first few excited levels in abundant nuclei from c to fe @xcite . for most of the @xmath0-ray lines here",
    "the agreement in the absolute cross section values is similar , typically within 50% .",
    "for a few lines the difference between experimental and calulated values reaches a factor of two .",
    "the energy dependence is generally also reasonably reproduced with a notable exception for some lines of @xmath4n in proton - induced reactions .",
    "the most striking and clear deviation of a calculated energy dependence from measurement is found for the 2.313-mev and 1.635-mev lines in proton - induced reactions . in figure [ fig_pn1635 ]",
    "one can observe that talys with default values reproduces the bump of the excitation function up to e@xmath16 = @xmath915 mev but falls severely below the experimental values above that energy .",
    "this is a clear indication that the compound nucleus component which usually dominates below 15 mev is reasonably predicted while the direct reaction component expected to dominate above that energy is much too small in talys . in the latter mechanism the largest contribution to the 1.635-mev line",
    "is from inelastic scattering to the second excited state of @xmath4n at 3.948 mev which has a nearly 100% branching to the 2.313 mev state .",
    "the cross section in the direct reaction mechanism is approximately proportional to the square of the deformation parameter @xmath52 for that state . in the present version of talys",
    "the default calculation is done with a @xmath52-value of practically zero .",
    "we introduced this state into the deformation data base in talys which defines the levels belonging to collective bands , their coupling and the deformation parameters .",
    "the 3.948-mev state was included as the second member of the ground state rotational band , and the deformation parameter @xmath52 of the band was adjusted in order to reproduce the experimental data for the 1.635-mev line above e@xmath16 = 15 mev . as starting parameter the value calculated from the b(e2 ) of the transition 3.948 mev @xmath45 g.s .",
    "( see e.g. @xcite ) was used . additionally , we adjusted the deformation parameters @xmath53 and @xmath52 of the states at 5.834 and 7.029 mev , respectively , in order to improve the calculations for other lines , in particular the ones at 0.728 and 5.105 mev .",
    "the values which are reported in table [ table_ndef ] are close to the parameters extracted from analyses of inelastic proton scattering angular distributions ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the results for the 1.635-mev line are shown in figure [ fig_pn1635 ] .",
    "one clearly observes a substantial improvement above e@xmath16 @xmath9 15 mev with good agreement between calculated and measured values with adjusted @xmath52 parameter .",
    "a similar improvement can be seen in the same figure for the 2.313-mev line which above 15 mev is strongly produced by the cascade following inelastic scattering to the 3.948-mev level .",
    "the improvement for the 1.635-mev line therefore quite naturally improves also the agreement between calculation and measurement for this line .",
    "a second mechanism contributing significantly to the 2.313-mev line is radioactive decay of @xmath4o , following the @xmath4n(p , n)@xmath4o reaction .",
    "this contribution has been measured in our energy range in several experiments , where globally the form of the cross section excitation functions agree in the different data sets while for the absolute normalization essentially two groups appear ( see e.g. exfor @xcite ) .",
    "one group with maximum cross section at @xmath910 mev of about 100 mb , and one group with about 10 mb . from our spectra of the proton irradiation at e@xmath16 = 10.23 mev a maximum contribution of 30% to the 2.313-mev line can be attributed to the @xmath4n(p , n)@xmath4o reaction ( see fig .",
    "[ figspec ] ) .",
    "this yields an upper limit of 35 mb to the ( p , n ) reaction , which is in complete disagreement with the excitation functions reaching 100 mb cross section at 10 mev .",
    "we therefore choose to rely on the washington data for the @xmath4n(p , n)@xmath4o reaction @xcite , which agree with @xcite .",
    "the talys calculation with default values overpredicts severely the @xmath4n(p , n)@xmath4o reaction by a factor of approximately 10 with respect to the washington data .",
    "we were able to approach the measured values for the ( p , n ) reaction only with a change in the preequilibrium calculation ( taking the multi - step direct / compound calculation instead of the default exciton model ) .",
    "the overall agreement of the talys calculation with measurement for the sum of inelastic scattering off @xmath4n and decay of @xmath4o is finally reasonable , although the cross section for the bump around e@xmath16 = 10 mev is still overestimated .    the third line shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_pn1635 ] is the 5.105-mev line .",
    "the cross section increase in the talys calculation with modified deformation parameters above e@xmath16 = 15 mev is due to the adjustment of the deformation parameter @xmath53 of the 5.834-mev state which has a strong branching to the 5.106-mev state .",
    "it is , however , not completely sufficient to reproduce the data above e@xmath16 = 15 mev .",
    "a still larger @xmath53 would overpredict the 0.728-mev line cross section .",
    "the three lines shown here represent a typical sample for the degree of agreement between calculation and measurement , which for proton - induced reactions with @xmath4n ranges from reasonable to moderate .",
    "a complete description of calculations can be found in @xcite .",
    "a better description of the cross section excitation functions probably requires a detailed study of the reaction mechanisms and the optical potentials for the incoming channel p + @xmath4n and different outgoing channels like n + @xmath4o and @xmath1 + @xmath54b .",

    "the reproduction of the experimental @xmath0-ray line data is maybe slightly better than for proton reactions , which comes somehow as a surprise because @xmath1-particle optical potentials are believed to be less reliable than the ones for protons .",
    "it may point to the fact that there is a specific problem in the reaction mechanism for protons with @xmath4n suggested also by the large overestimation of the @xmath4n(p , n)@xmath4o reaction cross section in the default talys calculation .",
    "we concentrated our studies to @xmath0-ray lines of the two neon isotopes , @xmath25ne , @xmath42ne and the main silicon isotope @xmath6si .",
    "the first three levels of these isotopes have the typical spin - parity sequence : 0@xmath29 , 2@xmath29 , 4@xmath29 of a collective ground - state vibrational or rotational band . in the default talys calculation a rotational coupling is considered for these levels with deformation parameters @xmath52 and @xmath56 .",
    "predictions here are already within typically 30% of experimental data with a reasonable reproduction of the energy dependence for most of the @xmath0-ray lines .",
