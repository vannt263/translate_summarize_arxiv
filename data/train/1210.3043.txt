    "the isotropic - nematic quantum phase transition was proposed as a possible mechanism to explain the anisotropic behavior of several strongly correlated systems . some interesting examples are quantum hall liquids , high @xmath5 superconductors and heavy fermions systems .",
    "an interesting review can be found in reference  .",
    "this transition can be understood as an instability of a fermi surface under the influence of a strongly attractive two - body potential in the forward scattering channel , with d - wave symmetry ( or equivalently , with angular momentum @xmath6 ) . from the point of view of landau fermi liquid theory ,",
    "it is triggered by a pomeranchuk instability produced by a large negative value of the landau parameter @xmath4 in the charged sector . as a consequence of the transition , the fermi surface is deformed , getting an ellipsoidal component .",
    "the goldstone modes , related with rotational symmetry breaking , are dissipative over - damped excitations , characterized by dynamical exponent @xmath7 .",
    "the order parameter theory was developed using different techniques : mean field theory@xcite , multidimensional bosonization@xcite and landau fermi liquid theory@xcite . while the collective bosonic excitations are reasonably well understood , the fate of the fermionic spectrum is still under debate@xcite .    from an experimental point of view , the study of fermi surface deformations can be performed by means of at least two independent techniques : arpes@xcite and the observation of quantum oscillations@xcite , like for instance , the de haas - van alphen effect . the use of the latter resides in the ability to reconstruct fermi surface shapes from the information contained in quantum oscillations of different observables , when an externally applied magnetic field is varied .",
    "the application of a strong magnetic field suppresses any pomeranchuk instability , since it opens a gap in the spectrum due to landau level quantization .",
    "however , for small magnetic fields , the landau levels form a dense set near the fermi energy and strong attractive interactions mix all levels in a non - trivial way . experimentally , nematic instability have been observed in the bilayer ruthenate compound sr@xmath8ru@xmath9o@xmath10 at finite magnetic field  @xcite , which suggests that a meta - magnetic quantum critical point can be reached by changing the direction of the applied magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to understand the critical behavior when the quantum critical point is reached by lowering the magnetic field .    with this motivation , we would like to present a study of a two - dimensional pomeranchuk - nematic instability in the presence of a small magnetic field , applied perpendicular to the two - dimensional fermionic system .",

    "studying the oscillatory slowest mode , we can compute the transition line where the isotropic phase gets unstable .",

    "moreover , we have observed a reentrant behavior of the isotropic phase for greater values of the interaction parameter .",
    "we have also analyzed the behavior of collective modes near the quantum critical point ( @xmath17 ) . since the magnetic field breaks parity symmetry , the collective mode dynamics mixes symmetric as well as antisymmetric modes .",

    "is confined to a small region around the fermi surface .",
    "then , it is more convenient to define @xmath57 where @xmath58 measures local fermi surface deformation .",

    "we will set up our model and will study the pomeranchuk instability in the nematic channel .",
    "for simplicity we consider a two - dimensional circular fermi surface .",
    "the interaction landau function depends essentially on the angle between two fermi momenta and can be expanded in landau parameters as @xmath65 where @xmath66 .",
    "moreover , we can expand the deformation of the fermi surface in fourier coefficients @xmath67 where @xmath68 .    to study the pomeranchuk - nematic instability , it is sufficient to consider a simplified model defined by @xmath69 , while @xmath70 for all @xmath71 .",

    "this is the onset of the pomeranchuk - nematic instability .",
    "when a magnetic field is applied , parity , as well as time reversal symmetry are broken .",

    "the vectorial structure of equation ( [ epsilona ] ) filters only contributions to the modes @xmath123 .",

    "comes from the linear response theory , while the last term , proportional to the interaction range @xmath132 , is the first `` correction '' coming from equation ( [ epsilona ] ) .",
    "near the transition line @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 are very rapid and stable modes , while the coupling with the antisymmetric modes are very weak .",
    "thus , they do not modify the transition qualitatively . in the next section",
    "we will study these couplings in more detail .",

    "corrections of order @xmath141 depend on @xmath142 .",
    "thus , differently from the usual pomeranchuk transition , small perturbations with different values of @xmath142 will contribute to the instability at different values of @xmath138 .",
    "on the other hand , the momentum perturbation is limited to the range @xmath143 .",
    "it is simple to show that the extremal line , necessary to built up the complete phase diagram is reached at @xmath144 .",
    "therefore , the transition line is given by @xmath145 where the only free parameter is the interaction range @xmath146 .",
    "we depict eq .",
    "( [ line ] ) in figure ( [ pd ] ) .",
    "as expected , a magnetic field strongly reduces the phase space for pomeranchuk instabilities . for small values of the magnetic field , the quantum critical point is shifted to grater attractive values of the interaction @xmath147 , or @xmath148 .",
    "indeed , we observe a maximum value of the magnetic field @xmath149 reached at @xmath150 above which , no pomeranchuk instability is possible .",
    "moreover , we observe a reentrant behavior of the disordered isotropic phase for greater values of the attractive interaction .",

    ", it does not represent a real pomeranchuk instability since , on one hand its coupling with @xmath91 also goes to zero with the magnetic field , and not only its frequency but also its velocity goes to zero as @xmath182",
    ". however , it has an important effect on the fermi surface deformation of the unstable mode since its coupling is a direct consequence of parity breaking , producing a contribution that breaks nematic symmetry as shown in figure ( [ sf ] ) .",
    "in fact , near the quantum critical point the slowest mode is invariant under the combined transformation @xmath201 .    in order to have a complete picture of the isotropic - nematic phase transition under the influence of a magnetic field , it is necessary to study the ordered phase . to do that in the context of landau theory of fermi liquids",
    ", it is necessary to go beyond the linear approximation in @xmath55 and to study the collision integral @xmath202 in the landau - silin equation ( [ kinetic ] ) .",
