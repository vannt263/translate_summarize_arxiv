    "in many transition metal oxides , different orbital configurations are close in energy or even degenerate .",
    "small changes in temperature or pressure can therefore lead to a complete rearrangement of the electron clouds which in turn also strongly influences the magnetic and the transport properties .",
    "such orbital degrees of freedom play an important role , for example , in the manganites , titanates , vanadates , and ruthenates.@xcite quite common for these transition metal oxides is the perovskite crystal structure where each transition metal ion is surrounded by an octahedron of oxygen ions . for a @xmath1 transition metal ion ,",
    "the cubic crystal field then splits the fivefold orbital degeneracy into threefold degenerate @xmath2 orbitals and twofold degenerate @xmath3 orbitals .",
    "here we want to concentrate first on the case where we have one electron per site in the @xmath2 orbitals with the @xmath3 orbitals being inactive ( fully occupied or empty ) . because the onsite coulomb interactions are large the system is a mott insulator in this case .",
    "the strongly anisotropic shape of the @xmath2 orbitals means that the direction an electron can move to create a virtually excited state depends on the orbital it is sitting in .",
    "more precisely , hopping is only possible between orbitals of the same kind , and along a particular crystal axis only two out of the three @xmath2 orbitals are active .",
    "this can lead to a ( dynamical ) lowering of the effective dimensionality of the system in various ways : conventional orbital ordering can restrict the hopping to one - dimensional chains which can then show typical one - dimensional phenomena like a haldane gap @xcite or a peierls effect.@xcite more unconventional mechanisms like an orbital - driven peierls effect@xcite or spin - orbital nematic states @xcite might also render the system quasi one dimensional . in the latter cases ,",
    "however , there will still be a twofold orbital degeneracy .",
    "a simple hamiltonian capturing the essential physics is then given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is an @xmath6 spin operator and @xmath7 a @xmath8 orbital pseudospin describing the occupation of the two degenerate orbitals active along the chain direction .",
    "@xmath9 is the magnetic superexchange constant , @xmath10 the hopping amplitude , @xmath11 the onsite coulomb repulsion , and @xmath12 real numbers often treated as free parameters . from a microscopic derivation of the effective model ( [ intro1 ] )",
    "it follows , however , that @xmath12 are determined by the hund s rule coupling @xmath13 with @xmath14 corresponding to @xmath15 .",
    "in addition , such a derivation shows that a finite hund s coupling does not only modify @xmath12 but also leads to an @xmath16-type anisotropy of the orbital sector.@xcite this anisotropy is neglected in ( [ intro1 ] ) .",
    "we will come back to the relation between this simple model and more realistic models in section [ titanates ] .",
    "the spin - orbital model ( [ intro1 ] ) has been intensely studied @xcite and a number of different phases depending on @xmath12 have been identified ( see e.g.  refs .  , ) . in general , the model has a @xmath17 symmetry and exhibits an additional @xmath18 symmetry , interchanging spin and orbital degrees of freedom , if @xmath19 . at the special point @xmath14 the symmetry is enlarged even further to @xmath20 .",
    "this has to do with the fact that at this point the hamiltonian is just a permutation operator of states on neighboring sites .",
    "the model therefore becomes a version of the uimin - sutherland model and is integrable by bethe ansatz.@xcite    in this work we want to study the effects of hole doping on the spin - orbital model ( [ intro1 ] ) . because states with more than one electron per site are effectively forbidden due to the strong coulomb repulsion @xmath11 , hole doping of the mott insulator ( [ intro1 ] ) naturally leads us to a generalized @xmath0 model    @xmath21    here @xmath22 projects out the doubly occupied states , @xmath23 is the spin , and @xmath24 the orbital index . as for the one - band @xmath0 model it turns out that there is a special point in parameter space @xmath25 , @xmath14 where the model is integrable by bethe ansatz .",
    "again , the symmetry is enlarged at this point to @xmath26 ( graded @xmath27 symmetry ) , the hamiltonian is a permutation operator of states on neighboring sites and falls into the uimin - sutherland class of models .    in sec .",

    "if superconductivity can be stabilized at all in a possible nematic phase of latio@xmath160 or ytio@xmath160 there is therefore the possibility that it will be of triplet character .",
    "in this paper we studied the thermodynamic properties of hole - doped one - dimensional mott insulators with orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "we described such systems in terms of generalized ( multi - band ) @xmath0 models . neglecting the hund s rule splitting of the virtually excited states",
    "we were led to a model which is integrable for one specific value of the ratio @xmath56 . at this point",
    "the model becomes @xmath26 symmetric ( graded @xmath27 symmetry ) and belongs to the so called uimin - sutherland class of models.@xcite the integrability at this particular point is analogous to the integrability of the usual @xmath0 model at the supersymmetric point .",

    "in the second part of the paper we used the density matrix renormalization group applied to transfer matrices ( tmrg ) to study the thermodynamics of the two - band @xmath0 model away from the integrable point . by comparing with bethe ansatz results at the integrable point we first demonstrated that the obtained numerical results are accurate down to low temperatures @xmath213 . for large values of @xmath56",

    "the long - range nature of the dimer order , however , seems to break down immediately upon hole doping .",
    "starting from the phase of the undoped model where the spins are fully ferromagnetically polarized and the orbitals show antiferromagnetic correlations we found that upon hole doping the spin triplet / orbital singlet pair correlation dominates among the various possible pair correlation functions .",
    "this correlation function will decay algebraically at zero temperature so that interchain couplings might stabilize true triplet superconductivity in this phase .    in the last part we used the tmrg algorithm to study the effects of hole doping for a one - dimensional version of a realistic model for cubic titanates .",
    "the model can be written in a form making it very similar to the one considered earlier .",
    "previously independent parameters , however , now become functions of the ratio @xmath180 of hund s coupling @xmath13 and the onsite coulomb repulsion @xmath11 , and there is an additional @xmath16-type anisotropy of the orbital sector .",
    "the effective superexchange coupling is a function of @xmath180 as well and increases monotonically with increasing @xmath180 . for @xmath192",
    "this leads to a phase separated ground state .",

    "the phase transition is first order . for @xmath214",
    "the dominating pair correlation is again of spin triplet / orbital singlet character and might lead to a true superconducting instability if interchain couplings are present .",
    "interestingly , realistic @xmath180-values for latio@xmath160 are close to @xmath209 .",
    "although a purely one - dimensional model is not appropriate for this compound , the nature of local correlations might be correctly captured and @xmath180 being close to @xmath209 might contribute to the peculiar properties of this compound , in particular , to the extremely small g - type magnetic moment .",

    "it is thus necessary to encode the bethe ansatz equations into an alternative form for which the limit can be taken analytically .",
