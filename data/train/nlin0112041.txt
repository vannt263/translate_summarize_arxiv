    "we show that the time evolution rule of the periodic bbs ( pbbs ) is given by a boolean formula , which turns out to be an algorithm to calculate the @xmath0th root of a given number through inverse ultradiscretization .",

    ", we establish a relation of the pbbs to the combinatorial @xmath1 matrix model and extend the time evolution rule to the general pbbss with various box capacities .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the concluding remarks .",

    "at the initial time @xmath4 , all but finite number of the boxes are empty , and each of the rest boxes contains one ball such as :    p1.0em*13| p0.5em p0em @xmath5 & & & & & & & & & & & & & @xmath5 & +    the time evolution rule of this system from time @xmath6 to @xmath7 is given as follows .    1 .",

    "this is a general behavior of the bbs and , starting from an arbitrary initial state , we can prove that the state asymptotically evolves into the state that consists of only freely moving solitons .",
    "it is also known that the bbs has infinite number of conserved quantities@xcite . by replacing an empty box by `` 0 '' and a filled box by `` 1 '' ,",
    "we regard the bbs as a dynamical system of `` 01 '' sequence , namely , a ca .",
    "the relation between bbs and ( classical ) integrable systems , _",

    "since the discrete kp equation is equivalent to the generating formula of the kp hierarchy , the bbs naturally inherits its integrability and shows solitonic natures . in this sense ,",

    "( we may imagine that the boxes are arranged in a circle . )",
    "we also assume that the box capacity is one for all the boxes .",
    "since the evolution rule of the bbs requires the definition of the _ leftmost _ ball in the bbs , we can not apply the original evolution rule directly to a periodic system .",
    "instead , we consider the following time evolution rule :    1 .",
    "move all the balls to their conterminous right boxes if the boxes are empty .",
    "2 .   forget the boxes to which and from which the balls were moved in the first step , and move all of the rest balls to their conterminous right boxes if they are empty .",
    "3 .   repeat the above procedure until all the balls are moved .",
    "an example of the movement of the balls by this rule is illustrated in fig .",

    "we see that this rule is equivalent to the original time evolution rule when we apply it to the bbs with an infinite array of the boxes . in this rule ,",
    "the number of balls which move at each stage does not change in time evolution .",

    "the time evolution of pbbs is represented by a diagram with @xmath8 nodes and @xmath9 lines each of which connects two of the distinct nodes as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figdia ] .",
    "each node corresponds to a box of the pbbs and a line is drawn from the box which contains a ball to the box to which the ball is moved . from the time evolution rule of the pbbs , we find the following properties of the diagram :    * there is no intersection of the lines .",

    "an advantage of this rule is that it is straightforward to extend the rule to the bbs with many kinds of balls and various box capacities .",
    "we can also use the combinatorial @xmath1 matrix of @xmath43 to give an equivalent evolution rule , the detail of which is presented in section 4 .",
