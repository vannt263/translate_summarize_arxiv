    "the subject of the sinusoidal perturbation of a quantum mechanical object is a very general one and has a long history . here",
    "we will treat this subject for the particular case of particles with states that have a quadratic shift under the influence of a perturbation .",
    "this is what is generally found in second - order perturbation theory .",
    "the typical example is the polarizability of a neutral particle under the influence of an electric field .",
    "the realization chosen to study this phenomenon is the dipole - dipole interaction between rydberg atoms , because this system provides the resolution and flexibility required for these experiments .",
    "apart from representing a much broader class of phenomena , the study of dipole - dipole interaction in oscillating fields provides us a direct tool to measure the coherence time of the interaction and the possibility of switching the interaction .",
    "both aspects are relevant for the feasibility of implementing quantum information processing with rydberg atoms .",
    "first we will give a description of polar and polarizable systems in a rf field , i.e. we compare the situation for states with a linear versus a quadratic stark shift .",
    "we use the floquet approach , which is applicable for periodically varying fields . in this framework",
    "a two - level system plus oscillating field is replaced by an infinite number of sidebands on the two states . for a quadratic stark shift",
    "the result is fundamentally different and much richer than for a linearly stark shifted state .",
    "next we compare the floquet description with the classical limit .",
    "in addition we interpret the oscillations of the population of the sidebands as stckelberg oscillations .    in the subsequent section",
    "we describe details of the experiment and present results of the measurements .",
    "related experiments have been performed with transitions within single rydberg atoms , in most cases for states with a linear stark shift @xcite , but also quadratic shifts have been studied @xcite .",
    "collisions of rydberg atoms in an oscillating field have been studied in an atomic beam setup @xcite , as well as in a cold cloud @xcite . in our experiment",
    "we control the interaction strength by maintaining a fixed distance between the rydberg - atom volumes .",
    "because of the small unperturbed energy mismatch between initial and final states , we use a rather low frequency for the oscillating field ; it lies in the radio frequency range rather than in the microwave range , giving the opportunity to test the coherence properties of the system for a longer period of time .",
    "to introduce the system under investigation we recall the two - level system @xcite , coupled by an interaction @xmath1 in the presence of a field @xmath2 @xmath3 with an oscillating and a static part .",
    "we write the full hamiltonian as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the hamiltonian of the two - level system without interaction , @xmath6 the interaction with the static field and @xmath7 the interaction with the oscillating field .",
    "v is the dipole interaction between the two involved states .",
    "we want to know the population in both states , so we need to know the full wavefunction @xmath8 , by solving the schrdinger equation .",
    "we solve the problem by starting from the known static solutions for @xmath9 , as described below , and then we add the other two terms as perturbation . in the next sub - section [ sec : num ] ` numerical solutions in the time domain ' we work out the problem by first adding the interaction term @xmath1 to the hamiltonian , and then the oscillating field @xmath7 .",
    "this provides us with two coupled equations which can be solved numerically in the time domain . in the subsequent sub - sections we work in the reverse order . in section [ sec : floquet ] ` floquet approach ' we add the oscillating field @xmath7 first and work out the problem in the frequency domain , which basically provides us with an infinite number of steady states in the form of sidebands .",
    "the classical limit of the sideband population , section [ sec : sideband ] , gives some physical insight in its behavior .",
    "then , in section [ sec : coupling ] ` coupling between dressed and undressed state ' we add the interaction term @xmath1 to the hamiltonian .",
    "the oscillations in the coupling as a function of rf amplitude can be understood in terms of stckelberg oscillations , explained in section [ sec : stueck ] .",
    "we will start by treating the perturbation of the hamiltonian @xmath5 in a static field . with just the first two terms of the hamiltonian @xmath10",
    "we obtain the solution @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the eigenstates of the system and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are their normalized time - independent amplitudes , @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the eigenenergies of the two stationary states .     and @xmath19 as a function of electric field .",

    "[ eq : feff].,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    we will discuss two cases , one for states with a linear stark shift and one for states with a quadratic stark shift . the first case is depicted in fig .  [ fig : introstuck]a .",

    "similar to the linear case this system is equivalent to two states with difference energy @xmath23 and a difference in polarizability of @xmath29 .",
    "the two levels cross at @xmath30 , where @xmath31      the most direct method to calculate the evolution of the wavefunction in an oscillating field is to numerically solve the two coupled differential equations for both states . for this",

    "this @xmath32 can also be interpreted as a quantum beat oscillation frequency : the population of state @xmath12 and @xmath13 oscillate against each other with this frequency after an appropriate initial condition .",

    "this separation of time- and spatial dependence is only allowed if both spatial states remain approximately the same despite the applied fields .",
    "we will see in section [ sec : spectr ] that this assumption is valid . using this wavefunction in the time - dependent schrdinger equation we obtain @xmath37 now the energies @xmath17 and @xmath18 depend on time . for the linear case we have @xmath38 and for the quadratic case @xmath39 and in both cases @xmath40 .",

    "however , this numerical approach can be used for all time - dependent fields , whereas the floquet approach only works for periodic functions .      in the floquet approach",
    "we add the perturbations in the opposite order as in the numerical calculation ; so we first perturb the states @xmath12 and @xmath13 with the oscillating field and subsequently add the interaction @xmath1 between the two states @xcite .",

    "this is the steady - state solution of the problem , consisting of a number of states with different amplitudes , given by the bessel function @xmath50 , all with a different energy @xmath51     for the quadratic case case in an oscillating field of 8  mhz for different rf amplitudes .",

    "the red dashed lines indicate the classical limits , the maximum and minimum field values that occur in the oscillation .",
    "this is equivalent with the absolute order and absolute argument of the bessel function being equal .",
    "the result for the quadratically stark shifted case is quite different . combining eqs .",
    "[ eq : t2int ] and [ eq : en_time_quad ] we obtain @xmath52 here we have two exponents to expand in terms of bessel functions @xmath53 where @xmath54 is used on the third line .",
    "the amplitude of the sideband , i.e. the inner summation in the above expression , is known as the generalized bessel function @xmath55 .",

    "using these results the wavefunction becomes @xmath59 a similar description of sidebands on quadratically shifted states is given in @xcite .",
    "note that the leading order of the series expansion is proportional to @xmath60 ; a result that is also found for the linear case and that is expected from a description of multi - photon transitions .",
    "if we compare this wavefunction with the linear case it is the generalized bessel function instead of the regular bessel function that determines the sideband amplitude .",
    "the result depends on both the static field @xmath21 as well as the rf amplitude @xmath61 , whereas for the linear case it depends on the rf amplitude only .",
    "the energy of the sidebands is also fundamentally different and one obtains @xmath62 whereas in the linear case the energy of a particular sideband shifts with the static field @xmath21 only , in the quadratic case there is an additional term that depends on the rf amplitude @xmath63 .",
    "this term corresponds to the ac - stark shift of the state .",
    "it is convenient to define an effective field @xmath22 , such that the energy shift of such a static field corresponds to the energy shift of a given static plus rf field : @xmath64 the different behavior is visible in fig .",

    "again , the intensity depicts the population of the sideband : @xmath65 . as in the linear case",
    "more sidebands are populated with a larger rf field , but a clear difference is that the population of a sideband is now not only a function of the rf amplitude , but also of the dc field , visible as the changing intensity within one sideband .",
    "secondly , the different positions of the sidebands in each subfigure illustrates that the sideband energy also depends on @xmath61 ( note that the original state , or the @xmath66 sideband , in blue and indicated with  o  ,",
    "is shifted downwards for larger @xmath61 ) .",
    "the next step would be to add the coupling between state @xmath20 and state @xmath19 ( section [ sec : coupling ] ) , but first we will look closer into the population of the sidebands for different frequencies .       as a function of the sideband energy ( eqs .  [",

    "the behavior of both functions is studied as a function of frequency and compared to the classical limit ; the energy values that occur the most in the oscillating field correspond to the resonances with the strongest coupling strength , apart from some oscillatory behavior .",
    "the oscillatory behavior of the bessel function as well as the generalized bessel function can be explained in terms of stckelberg oscillations , which is an interference effect between the developed phases of the two interacting states .    in the experiment",
    "the resonance positions and the interaction strength fully fit the described theory .",
    "destructive stckelberg interference is clearly observed , which proves that our system is coherent for at least one period of the rf oscillation , 125  ns . from the ratio of the mutual distance the peaks and the width of the peaks",
    ", the lower bound is increased by a factor of 5 to 0.6  @xmath0s .",
    "simulations with multiple atom pairs at different distances , corresponding to our experimental situation of two cylinders of atoms , fit the observed interference patterns well .",
