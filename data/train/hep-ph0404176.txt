    "special attention is devoted to the impact of the poorly known scalar 4-quark condensates . we have found a strong @xmath2 mass parameter splitting .",
    "the scalar flavor mixing condensate has been evaluated at finite density using quite general assumptions .",
    "it turns out that this condensate , while responsible for the @xmath2 mass parameter splitting in vacuum , plays a subdominant role in matter . instead , the individual mass parameter splitting of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons is mainly governed by the landau damping terms .",
    "the scalar 4-quark condensates have a strong impact on the individual strengths of the mass parameter shifts , while the amount of the splitting is fairly insensitive to these condensates .",
    "we emphasize that the mass parameters are weighted moments of the spectral functions . a mass parameter shift in medium does not necessarily mean a simple shift of the peak position of a spectral function",
    ", rather additional strength may occur at lower or higher energies causing a shift of the weighted moment .",
    "the presently employed form of the qcd sum rule approach is not sensitive to such details .",
    "only a detailed modelling of the hadronic in - medium spectral function with parametric dependences allows for more concise statements @xcite .    another physical effect investigated concerns the @xmath2 mixing at finite density and the impact of the @xmath2 mass parameter splitting . starting with the vacuum we find an excellent agreement with experimental data recently obtained . in medium ,",
    "the nondiagonal selfenergy @xmath223 , which drives the mixing effect , is only weakly amplified in isospin symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the mixing parameter @xmath201 , however , is remarkably enlarged for strongly isospin asymmetric nuclear matter , such as in uranium nuclei with @xmath222 .",
    "therefore , not taking into account the individual mass shifts of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson would indeed result in an in - medium amplification of the mixing effect .",
    "in contrast , if one takes into account the strong mass parameter splitting of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons as a pronounced splitting of the corresponding peaks then the mixing effect in the pion formfactor as well as in the di - electron production rate disappears in medium , both for isospin symmetric and isospin asymmetric nuclear matter .",
