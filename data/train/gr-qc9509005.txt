    "probably each of us , at least when young , has sometimes imagined that every small particle of matter could be , at a suitably reduced scale , a whole cosmos .",
    "this idea has very ancient origins .",
    "it is already present , for example , in some works by democritus of abdera ( about 400  b.c . ) .",
    "democritus , simply inverting that analogy , spoke about huge atoms , as big as our cosmos . and , to be clearer",
    ", he added : if one of those super - atoms ( which build up super - cosmoses ) abandoned his  giant universe \" to fall down on our world , our world would be destroyed ...    such kind of considerations are linked to the fantasies about the physical effects of a dilation or contraction of all the objects which surround us , or of the whole `` world '' .",
    "fantasies like these have also been exploited by several writers : from f.  rabelais ( 1565 ) to j.  swift , the narrator of samuel gulliver s travels ( 1727 ) ; or to i.  asimov .",
    "it is probably because of the great diffusion of such ideas that , when the planetary model of the atom was proposed , it achieved a great success among people .    actually , we meet such intuitive ideas in the scientific arena too . apart from the already quoted democritus ,",
    "let us remember the old conception of a _ hierarchy _ of universes or rather of cosmoses each of them endowed with a particular _ scale factor _",
    "( let us think , for instance , of a series of russian dolls ) .",
    "nowadays , we can really recognize that the microscopic analysis of matter has revealed grosso modo a series of `` chinese boxes '' : so that we are entitled to suppose that something similar may be met also when studying the universe on a large scale , _",
    "i.e. _ , in the direction of the _ macro _ besides of the _ micro_. hierarchical theories were formulated for example by j.h .",
    "lambert ( 1761 ) and , later on , by v.l .",
    "charlier ( 1908 , 1922 ) and f.  selety ( 192224 ) ; followed more recently by o.  klein , h.  alfvn and g. de vaucouleurs , up to the works of a.  salam and co - workers , k.p .",

    "in this paper we confine ourselves to examine the possibility of considering elementary particles as micro universes:@xcite that is to say , the possibility that they be similar in a sense to be specified to our cosmos .",
    "more precisely , we shall refer ourselves to the thread followed by p.  caldirola , p.  castorina , a.  italiano , g.d .",
    "maccarrone , m.  pavsic , and ourselves.@xcite    let us recall that riemann , as well as clifford and later einstein,@xcite believed that the fundamental particles of matter were the perceptible evidence of a strong local space curvature .",
    "a theory which stresses the role of space ( or , rather , space - time ) curvature already does exist for our whole cosmos : general relativity , based on einstein gravitational field equations ; which are probably the most important equations of classical physical theories , together with maxwell s electromagnetic field equations .",
    "whilst much effort has already been made to generalize maxwell equations , passing for example from the electromagnetic field to yang ",
    "mills fields ( so that almost all modern gauge theories are modelled on maxwell equations ) , on the contrary einstein equations have never been applied to domains different from the gravitational one . even if they , as any differential equations , _ do not _ contain any inbuilt fundamental length : so that they can be used a priori to describe cosmoses of any size .",
    "our first purpose is now to explore how far it is possible to apply successfully the methods of general relativity ( gr ) , besides to the world of gravitational interactions , also to the domain of the so  called nuclear , or _ strong _",
    ", interactions:@xcite namely , to the world of the elementary particles called hadrons .",
    "a second purpose is linked to the fact that the standard theory ( qcd ) of strong interactions has not yet fully explained why the hadron constituents ( quarks ) seem to be permanently _ confined _ in the interior of those particles ; in the sense that nobody has seen up to now an isolated `` free '' quark , outside a hadron .",
    "so that , to explain that confinement , it has been necessary to invoke phenomenological models , such us the so  called `` bag '' models , in their mit and slac versions for instance . the `` confinement '' could be explained , on the contrary , in a natural way and on the basis of a well  grounded theory like gr , if we associated with each hadron ( proton , neutron , pion , ... ) a particular `` cosmological model '' .",
    "let us now try to justify the idea of considering the strong interacting particles ( that is to say , hadrons ) as micro - universes .",
    "we meet a first motivation if we think of the so  called `` large number coincidences '' , already known since several decades and stressed by h.  weyl , a.i .",
    "eddington , o.  klein , p.  jordan , p.a.m .",
    "dirac , and by others .",
    "the most famous among those empirical observations is that the ratio @xmath0 between the radius @xmath1 of our cosmos ( gravitational universe ) and the typical radius @xmath2 of elementary particles is grosso modo equal to the ratio @xmath3 between the strength @xmath4 of the nuclear ( `` strong '' ) field and the strength @xmath5 of the gravitational field ( we will give later a definition of @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) : @xmath6    this does immediately suggest the existence of a _ similarity _",
    ", in a geometrico  physical sense , between cosmos and hadrons . as a consequence of such similarity , the `` theory of models '' yields by exploiting simple dimensional considerations that , if we contract our cosmos of the quantity @xmath7 ( that is to say , if we transform it in a hadronic micro - cosmos _ similar _ to the previous one ) , the field strength would increase in the same ratio : so to get the gravitational field transformed into the strong one",
    "if we observe , in addition , that the typical duration of a decay is inversely proportional to the strength of the interaction itself , we are also able to explain why the mean - life of our gravitational cosmos ( @xmath8 s : duration for example of a complete expansion / contraction cycle , if we accept the theory of the cyclic _ big bang _ ) is a multiple , with the same ratio , of the typical mean - life ( @xmath9 ) of the  strong micro - universes \" , or hadrons : @xmath10    it is also interesting that , from the self - consistency of these deductions implies as we shall show later that the mass @xmath11 of our cosmos should be equal to @xmath12 times the typical mass @xmath13 of a hadron :  a fact that seems to agree with reality , and constitutes a further `` numerical coincidence '' , the so  called eddington relation .",
    "another numerical coincidence is shown and explained in ref.@xcite    by making use of mandelbrot s language@xcite and of his general equation for self - similar structures , what precedes can be mathematically translated into the claim that cosmos and hadrons are systems , with scales @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively , whose `` fractal dimension '' is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the auto - similarity exponent that characterizes the hierarchy . as a consequence of all that , we shall assume that cosmos and hadrons ( both of them regarded of course as finite objects ) be _ similar _ systems :  that is , that they be governed by similar laws , differing only for a `` global '' scale transformation which transforms @xmath18 into @xmath19 and gravitational field into strong field .",
    "[ to fix our ideas , we may _ temporarily _ adopt the nave model of a `` newtonian ball '' in three  dimensional space for both cosmos and hadrons .",
    "later on , we shall adopt more sensible models , for example friedmann s ] .",
    "let us add , incidentally , that we should be ready _ a priori _ to accept the existence of other cosmoses besides ours :  let us recall that man in every epoch has successively called `` _ universe _ '' his valley , the whole earth , the solar system , the milky way and today ( but with the same simple  mindedness ) our cosmos , as we know it on the basis of our observational and theoretical instruments ",
    "@xcite    thus , we arrive at a _ second _",
    "motivation for our theoretical approach : that physical laws should be covariant (= form invariant ) under _ global _ dilations or contractions of space - time",
    ". we can easily realize this if we notice that : ( i ) when we dilate ( or contract ) our measure units of space and time , physical laws , of course , should _ not _ change their form ;   ( ii ) a dilation of the measure units is totally equivalent to a contraction ( leaving now  meter \" and  second \" unaltered ) of the observed world .",
    "actually , maxwell equations of electromagnetism the most important equations of classical physics , together with einstein equations , as we already said are by themselves covariant also under conformal transformations and , in particular , under dilations . in the case",
    "when electric charges are present , such a covariance holds provided that charges themselves are suitably `` scaled '' .",
    "analogously , also einstein _ gravitational _ equations are covariant@xcite under dilations : provided that , again , when in the presence of matter and of a cosmological term @xmath20 , they too are scaled according to correct dimensional considerations .",
    "the importance of this fact had been well realized by einstein himself , who two weeks before his death wrote , in connection with his last unified theory : @xmath21from the form of the field [ _ gravitational _ + _ electromagnetic _ ] equations it follows immediately that : if @xmath22 is a solution of the field equations , then also @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a positive constant , is a solution ( `` similar solutions '' ) . let us suppose , for example , that @xmath25 represents a finite crystal embedded in a flat space .",
    "it is then possible that a second ` universe ' exists with another crystal , identical with the first one , but dilated @xmath24 times with respect to the former . as far as we confine ourselves to consider a universe containing only one crystal , there are no difficulties : we just realize that the size of such a crystal ( standard of length ) is not determined by the field equations",
    " @xmath26 .",
    "these lines are taken from einstein s preface to the italian book _",
    "cinquantanni di relativit_.@xcite they have been written in princeton on april 4th , 1955 , and stress the fact , already mentioned by us , that differential equations as all the fundamental equations of physics do not contain any inbuilt `` fundamental length '' .",
    "in fact , einstein equations can describe the internal dynamics of our cosmos , as well as of much bigger super - cosmoses , or of much smaller micro - cosmoses ( suitably `` scaled '' ) .",
    "as a first step for better exploiting the symmetries of the fundamental equations of classical physics , let us therefore fix our attention on the space - time _ dilations _ @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and explicitly require physical laws to be covariant with respect to them : under the hypothesis , however , that only _ discrete _ values of @xmath30 are realized in nature .",
    "as before , we are moreover supposing that @xmath30 is constant as the space or time position varies ( global , besides _ discrete _ , dilations ) .",
    "let us recall that natural objects interact essentially through four ( at least ) fundamental forces , or interactions : the gravitational , the `` weak '' , the electromagnetic and the `` strong '' ones ; here listed according to their ( growing ) strength .",
    "it is possible to express such strengths by pure numbers , so to be allowed to compare them each other .",
    "for instance , if one chooses to define each strength as the dimensionless _",
    "square _ of a `` vertex coupling constant '' , the electromagnetic strength results to be measured by the ( dimensionless ) coefficient  @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the electron charge , @xmath33 the reduced planck constant , @xmath34 is the light speed in vacuum and @xmath35 is the electromagnetic interaction universal constant ( in the international system of units , @xmath36 , with @xmath37 = vacuum dielectric constant ) .",
    "here we are interested in particular in the gravitational and strong interaction strengths : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath14 are the gravitational and strong universal constants , respectively ; quantities @xmath13 e @xmath40 representing the gravitational charge ( = mass ) and the strong charge@xcite ( cf .",
    "fig .  1 )",
    ", respectively , of one and the same hadron : for example of a nucleon @xmath41 or of a pion @xmath42 .",
    "more precisely , we shall often adopt in the following the convention of calling @xmath13 and @xmath40 `` _ gravitational mass _ '' and `` _ strong mass _ '' , respectively .",
    "let us consider , therefore , two identical particles endowed with both gravitational ( @xmath13 ) and strong ( @xmath40 ) mass , _",
    "i.e. _ , two identical hadrons , and the ratio between the strengths @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the corresponding strong and gravitational interactions .",
    "we find @xmath43 ,  so that one verifies that @xmath44 .",
    "for example for @xmath45 one gets @xmath46 , while the pp@xmath42 or @xmath47 ( or quark - quark - gluon : see below ) coupling constant squares are  @xmath48 or 3 ( or 0.2 ) , respectively .    already at this point , we can make some simple remarks .",
    "first of all , let us notice that , _ if we put _",
    "conventionally @xmath49 , then the strong universal constant @xmath14 becomes @xmath50    on the contrary , if _ we choose _ units such that @xmath51 = [ g]$ ] and moreover @xmath52 , we obtain @xmath53 and , more precisely ( with @xmath54 or @xmath55 ) , @xmath56 which tells us that in suitable units the so  called `` planck mass '' is nothing but the _ magnitude _ of the rest strong  mass [ = strong charge ] of a typical hadron , or rather of quarks.@xcite    from this point of view , we should _ not _ expect the  micro black  holes \" ( with masses of the order of the planck mass ) , predicted by various authors , to exist ; in fact , we _ already _ know of the existence of quarks , whose _",
    "strong charges _ are of the order of the planck mass ( in suitable units ) .",
    "moreover , the fact well known in standard theories that gravitational interactions become as strong as the  strong \" ones for masses of the order of the planck mass does simply mean in our opinion that the _ strong gravity _ field generated by quarks inside hadrons ( strong micro - universes ) is nothing but the strong nuclear field .",
    "a consequence of what stated above is that inside a hadron ( _ i.e. _ , when we want to describe strong interactions among hadron constituents ) it must be possible to adopt the same einstein equations which are used for the description of gravitational interactions inside our cosmos ; with the only warning of scaling them down , that is , of suitably _ scaling _ , together with space distances and time durations , also the gravitational constant @xmath39 ( or the masses ) and the cosmological constant @xmath20 .",
    "let us now recall that einstein s equations for gravity do essentially state the equality of two tensorial quantities : the first describing the geometry ( curvature ) of space - time , and the second that we shall call `` matter tensor '' , @xmath57 describing the distribution of matter : @xmath58 .",
    "\\eqno(5)\\ ] ] as well - known ,   @xmath59 , while @xmath60 .    inside a hadron , therefore , equations of the same form will hold , except that instead of @xmath39 it will appear ( as we already know ) quantity @xmath61 and instead of @xmath20 it will appear the `` strong cosmological constant '' ( or `` hadronic constant '' ) @xmath62 : @xmath63 so that @xmath64 , or @xmath65 barn .    for brevity s sake , we shall call @xmath66 the `` strong matter tensor '' .",
    "what precedes can be directly applied , with a satisfactory degree of approximation , to the case for example of the pion : _",
    "i.e. _ , to the case of the cosmos / pion similarity . almost as if our cosmos were a super  pion , with a super  quark ( or `` metagalaxy '' , adopting ivanenko s terminology ) of matter and one of anti - matter . let us recall however that , as we already warned in section  * 3 * , the parameter @xmath30 _ can _ vary according to the particular cosmos and hadron considered .",
    "analogously @xmath20 , and therefore @xmath62 , can vary too :  with the further circumstance that a priori also their _ sign _ can change , when varying the object ( cosmos or hadron ) taken into examination .",
    "as far as @xmath67 is concerned , an even more important remark has to be made .",
    "let us notice that the gravitational coupling constant @xmath68 ( experimentally measured in the case of the interaction of two `` tiny components '' of our particular cosmos ) should be compared with the analogous constant for the interaction of two tiny _ components _ ( partons ?",
    "partinos ? ) of the corresponding hadron , or rather of a particular constituent quark of its . that constant is unknown to us .",
    "we know however , for the simplest hadrons , the quark - quark - gluon coupling constant : @xmath69 . as a consequence ,",
    "the best value for @xmath67 we can predict up to now for those hadrons is @xmath70 [ and , in fact , @xmath71 is the value which has provided the results most close to the experimental data ] :  a value that however will vary , let us repeat it , with the particular cosmos and the particular hadron chose for the comparison .",
    "the already mentioned `` large numbers '' empirical relations , which link the micro- with the macro - cosmos , have been obtained by us as a _ by - product _ of our scaled  down equations for the interior of hadrons , and of the ordinary einstein equations .",
    "notice , once more , that our `` numerology '' connects the gravitational interactions with the strong ones , and _ not _ with the electromagnetic ones ( as dirac , instead , suggested ) .",
    "it is worthwhile noticing that strong interactions , as the gravitational but differently from the electromagnetic ones, are highly non - linear and then associable to _ non_-abelian gauge theories .",
    "one of the purposes of our theoretical approach consists , incidentally , in proposing an _ ante litteram _",
    "geometrical interpretation of those theories .    before going on ,",
    "let us specify that the present _ geometrization _ of the strong field is justified by the circumstance that the  equivalence principle \" ( which recognizes the identity , inside our cosmos , of inertial and gravitational mass ) can be extended to the hadronic universe in the following way .",
    "the usual equivalence principle can be understood , according to mach , thinking of the inertia @xmath72 of a given body as due to its interaction with all the other masses of the universe : an interaction which in _ our _ cosmos is essentially gravitational ; so that @xmath72 coincides with the gravitational mass : @xmath73 . inside a `` hadronic cosmos '' , however , the predominant interaction among its constituents is the strong one ; so that the inertia @xmath72 of a constituent will coincide with its strong charge @xmath40 ( and not with @xmath74 ) .",
    "we shall see that our generalization of the equivalence principle will be useful for geometrizing the strong field not only inside a hadron , but also in its neighborhood .    both for the cosmos and for hadrons",
    ", we shall adopt friedmann  type models ; taking advantage of the fact that they are compatible with the mach principle , and are embeddable in 5  dimensions .",
    "let us see some _ consequences _ of our einstein  like equations , re - written for the strong field and therefore valid inside a hadron : @xmath75 . \\eqno(7)\\ ] ]    in the case of a spherical constituent , that is to say of a spherically symmetric distribution @xmath76 of `` strong mass '' , and in the usual schwarzschild - desitter @xmath19,@xmath77 coordinates , the known geodesic motion equations for a small test  particle ( let us call it a _ parton _ , with strong mass @xmath78 ) tell us that it will feel a `` force '' easy to calculate,@xcite which for low speeds [ _ static limit _ : @xmath79 reduces to the ( radial ) force : @xmath80    notice that , with proper care , also in the present case one can introduce a language in terms of `` force '' and `` potential '' ; for example in eq .",
    "8 we defined  @xmath81 .  in fig .",
    "2 the form is depicted of two typical potentials yielded by the present theory [ cf .",
    ".  8 ] .    at `` intermediate distances '' i.e .",
    ", at the newtonian limit this force simply reduces to @xmath82 , that is , to the sum of a newtonian term and of an elastic term _  la _ hooke .",
    "let us notice that , in such a limit , the last expression is valid even when the test particle @xmath78 does _ not _ posses a small strong mass , but is for example a second quark .",
    "otherwise , our expressions for @xmath83 are valid only _ approximately _ when also @xmath78 is a quark ; nevertheless , they can explain some important features of the hadron constituent behaviour , both for small and for large values of @xmath19 .    at very large distances ,",
    "when @xmath19 is of the same order of ( or is greater than ) the considered hadron radius ,  whenever we confine ourselves to the simplest hadrons ( and thus choose @xmath84 m@xmath85 ; @xmath86 ) , we end with an _ attractive _ radial force which is proportional to @xmath19 : @xmath87    in other words , one naturally obtains a confining force ( and a confining potential @xmath88 ) able a priori to explain the so  called _ confinement _ of the hadron constituents ( in particular , of quarks ) . because of this force , the motion of @xmath78 can be regarded in a first approximation as a harmonic motion ; so that our _ theory _ can include the various and interesting results already found by different authors for the hadronic properties for instance , hadron mass spectra just by _ postulating _ such a motion .    up to now",
    "we supposed @xmath62 to be positive .",
    "but it is worthwhile noticing that confinement is obtained also for negative values of @xmath62 .",
    "in fact , with less drastic approximations , for @xmath89 one gets : @xmath90 where , for @xmath19 large enough , the @xmath91 term is dominating .",
    "let us warn however that , when considering `` not simple '' hadrons ( so that @xmath62 , and moreover @xmath14 , may change their values ) , other terms can become important , like the newtonian one , @xmath92 , or even the _ constant _ term @xmath93 which corresponds to a linear potential .",
    "let us observe , finally , how this last equation predict that , for inter ",
    "quark distances of the order of 1  fm , two quarks have to attract each other with a force of _ some tons _ : a quite huge force , especially when recalling that it should act between two extremely tiny particles ( the _ constituents _ of mesons and baryons ) , whose magnitute would increase with the distance .",
    "let us pass to consider , now , _ not _ too big distances , always at the static limit .",
    "it is then important to add to the radial potential the usual `` kinetic energy term '' ( or centripetal potential ) , @xmath94 , in order to account for the orbital angular momentum of @xmath78 with respect to @xmath76 .",
    "the effective potential@xcite between the two constituents @xmath76 , @xmath78 gets thus the following form @xmath95 + { { ( j / g\")^{2 } } \\over { 2r^{2 } } } , \\eqno(8')\\ ] ] which , in the region where gr reduces essentially to the newtonian theory , simplifies into : @xmath96    in such a case the test particle @xmath78 can set itself ( performing a circular motion , for example : and in section  * 7 * we shall give more details ) at a distance @xmath97 from the source  constituent at which @xmath98 is minimum ; _ i.e. _ , at the distance  @xmath99 .  at this distance",
    "the `` effective force '' vanishes .",
    "thus we meet , at short distances , the phenomenon known as _ asymptotic freedom _ : for not large distances ( when the force terms proportional to @xmath19 and to @xmath100 become negligible ) , the hadron constituents behave as if they were ( almost ) free .",
    "if we now extrapolated , somewhat arbitrarily , the expression for @xmath97 to the case of two quarks [ for example , @xmath101 , we would obtain the preliminary estimate @xmath102 .",
    "vice - versa , by supposing for instance in the case of baryons , with @xmath103 and @xmath104 that the equilibrium radius @xmath97 be of the order of a hundredth of a fermi , one would get the regge  like relation @xmath105 ( where @xmath13 is measured in gev/@xmath106 ) .",
    "let us perform these calculations again , however , by using the _ complete _ expression of @xmath107 .",

    ", we obtain under the same hypothesis the value @xmath114 actually , for positive @xmath62 it exists the above solution _",
    "only_. for negative values of @xmath62 , however , the situation is more complex ; let us summarize it in the case of the @xmath14 and @xmath115 values adopted by us .",
    "one meets again at least one solution , which for @xmath108 takes the simple analytic form @xmath116 .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath117m@xmath85 one finds the values 0.7 and 1.7 fm , in correspondence to @xmath118 and @xmath119 ;  values that however become 0.3 and 0.6 fm , respectively , for @xmath120 .  in the @xmath108 case , at last , two _",
    "further _ solutions are met , the smaller one [ for @xmath117 m@xmath85 ] being once more @xmath122 fm .    by recalling that _",
    "mesons _ are made up of two quarks ( q , q ) , our approach suggests for mesons in their ground state when @xmath108 , at least the model of two quarks _ oscillating _ around an equilibrium position .",
    "it is rather interesting to notice that for small oscillations ( harmonic motions in space ) the dynamical group would then be su(3 ) .",
    "it is interesting to notice , too , that the value @xmath123 , corresponding to the frequency @xmath124 hz , yields the pion mass : @xmath125 .",
    "analogous results have to hold , obviously , for our cosmos ( or , rather , for the cosmoses which are `` dual '' to the hadrons considered ) .",
    "here we want to add just that , in the case of a spherically symmetric , static metric ( and in the coordinates in which it is diagonal ) , the lorentz factor is proportional to @xmath126 , so that the _ strong coupling constant _",
    "@xmath127 in our theory@xcite assumes the form:@xcite @xmath128 since the strong mass @xmath78 depends on the speed : @xmath129 so as the ordinary relativistic mass does .",
    "the behaviour of our `` constant '' @xmath130 is analogous to that one of the perturbative coupling constant of the `` standard theory '' ( qcd ) : that is to say , @xmath130 decreases as the distance @xmath19 decreases , and increases as it increases , once more justifying both confinement and `` asymptotic freedom '' .",
    "let us recall that , when@xcite @xmath131 , the definition of @xmath132 is  @xmath133 .",
    "since the schwarzschild  like coordinates ( @xmath134 ) do not correspond , as is well known , to any real observer , it is interesting from the _ physical _ point of view to pass to the local coordinates ( @xmath135 ) associated with observers who are _ at rest _",

    "one of the most interesting results is that , at the static limit ( when only @xmath172 and the strong field becomes a scalar field ) , we get that @xmath173  is exactly the _ yukawa potential _ : @xmath174 }",

    "we find that from the `` external '' point of view hadrons can be associated with the above mentioned `` _ strong black - holes _ '' ( sbh ) , which result to have radii @xmath175 .",
    "for @xmath176 , that is , when the field is very intense , we can perform the approximation just `` opposite '' to the linear one , by assuming @xmath177 .",
    "we obtain , then , equations which are essentially identical with the `` internal '' ones [ which is good for the matching of the hadron interior and exterior ! ] ; a consequence being that what we are going to say can be valid also for _ quarks _ , and not only for hadrons . before going on ,",
    "let us observe that @xmath62 can _ a priori _ take a certain sign outside a hadron , and the opposite sign inside it . in the following",
    "we shall confine ourselves to the case @xmath151 for simplicity s sake .    in general for negative @xmath62 one meets@xcite three `` strong horizons '' , _",
    "i.e. _ , three values of @xmath178 , that we shall call @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 .",
    "if we are interested in hadrons which are _ stable _ with respect to the strong interactions , we have to look for those solutions for which the sbh temperature@xcite [ = strong field strength at its surface ] almost vanishes .",
    "it is worth noticing that the condition of a vanishing field at the sbh surface implies the coincidence of two , or more , strong horizons;@xcite and that such coincidences imply in their turn some `` regge  like '' relations among @xmath13 , @xmath62 , @xmath14 , @xmath182 and @xmath183 ,  if @xmath13 , @xmath182 , @xmath183 are now mass , charge and _ intrinsic angular momentum _ of the considered hadron , respectively .",
    "more precisely , if we choose a priori the values of @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath62 and @xmath14 , then our theory yields _ mass _ and _ radius _ of the corresponding stable hadron .",
    "our theoretical approach is , therefore , a rare example of a formalism which can yield at least a priori the _ masses _ of the stable particles ( and of the quarks themselves ) .",
    "we arrived at the point of checking whether and how our approach can yield the values of the hadron masses and radii : in particular for hadrons stable with respect to strong interactions ; one can guess a priori that such values will possess the correct order of magnitude .",
    "several calculations have been performed by us , in particular for the meson mass spectra;@xcite although they because of our laziness with respect to numerical elaborations are still waiting for being reorganized .    here",
    "we quickly outline just some of the results . at first , let us consider the case of the simultaneous coincidence of all the _ three _ horizons ( @xmath184 ) .",
    "we get a system of equations that for example rules out the possibility that intrinsic angular momentum ( spin ) @xmath183 and electric charge @xmath182 be simultaneously zero [ _ practically _ ruling out particles with @xmath108 ] ;  it also implies the interesting relation  @xmath186 ; and finally it admits ( real and positive ) solutions only for _ low _ values of @xmath183 , the upper limit of the spin depending on the chosen parameters .",
    "the values we obtained for the ( small ) radii and for the masses suggest that the `` _ triple coincidences _ '' represent the case of _ quarks_. the basic formulae for the explicit calculations are the following.@xcite first of all , let us put @xmath187 , so that @xmath188 .",
    "let us then define , as usual ,  @xmath189 ;  @xmath190 ;  @xmath191 , and moreover @xmath192 .",
    "then , the radii of the stable particles ( quarks , in this case ) are given by the _",
    "simple _ equation  @xmath193 ;  but the masses are given by the solution of a system of two regge  like relations :  @xmath194 ;  @xmath195 .",
    "the cases of `` _ double coincidence _ '' , that is , of the coincidence of two ( out of three ) horizons only , seem to be able to describe stable baryons and mesons .",
    "the fundamental formulae become , however , more complex.@xcite let us define  @xmath196 ; @xmath197 ; @xmath198 .",
    "the stable hadron s radii are then given by the relation @xmath199 ; while the masses are given by the non simple equation @xmath200 , which relates @xmath11 with @xmath148 , @xmath201 and @xmath62 .",
    "of course , some simplifications are met in particular cases .",
    "for example , when @xmath202 , we get the regge  like relation : @xmath203 which when @xmath182 is negligible becomes @xmath204 , that is [ with @xmath205 : @xmath206 on the contrary , when @xmath108 , and @xmath182 is still negligible , we obtain [ always with @xmath205 : @xmath207 also in the cases of `` triple coincidence '' simple expressions are found , when @xmath208 .  under such a condition , one meets the simple system of two equations : @xmath209 where the second relation is written with @xmath210 .",
    "all the `` geometric '' evaluations of this section  * 9 * are referred as we have seen only to _ stable _ hadrons ( _ i.e. _ , to hadrons corresponding to sbhs with  temperature \" @xmath211 ) , because we do not know of general rules associating a temperature @xmath212 with the many _ resonances _ experimentally discovered ( which will correspond@xcite to temperatures _ of the order _ of @xmath213k , if they have to  evaporate \" in times of the order of @xmath214s ) .",
    "calculations apt at comparing our theoretical approach with experimental mass spectra ( for mesons , for example ) have been till now performed , therefore , by making recourse to the trick of inserting our inter ",
