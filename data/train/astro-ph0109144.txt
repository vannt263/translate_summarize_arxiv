    "it was in 1994 that egret observed a @xmath0-ray burst which showed a @xmath0-ray emission above 50 mev up to @xmath51.5 hours after the start of the burst .",
    "the @xmath0-quantum with the highest energy was observed after @xmath51.3 hours with an energy of 18 gev @xcite .",
    "this was an unexpected and very surprising result and as of yet the relation between this high - energy and the low - energy emission is not understood .",
    "it is a goal of the glast mission to investigate this relation and to unravel the underlying physical processes .",
    "a typical spectrum of a @xmath0-ray burst is characterized by a broken power law ( see figure 1 ) . below a certain break energy @xmath6",
    "the spectrum can be described by a power law e@xmath7 with an exponential decline , whereas above this energy it is a pure power law e@xmath8 indicating a non - thermal origin of this part of the spectrum .",
    "the break - energy @xmath6 at which the luminosity reaches a maximum has a log - normal distribution around an energy of 250 kev @xcite . in order to determine @xmath6 well enough",
    "one needs a long lever arm on both sides of this energy , accentuating the importance of low- and high - energy measurements .",
    "the spectral index @xmath9 of the low - energy emission is distributed around a value of -1 spanning the range from -2 to 0 .",
    "this distribution strongly constrains popular burst - emission models like the synchrotron emission from shocked electrons ( @xcite and @xcite ) or the blast - wave model @xcite strongly .",
    "the distribution of the spectral index @xmath10 of the high - energy emission reaches a maximum around -2.3 .",
    "it extends from -3.5 to -1.4 @xcite .",
    "the spectra with @xmath10-values @xmath11 - 2 are of special interest because in this case the spectrum would diverge for e @xmath12 @xmath13 .",
    "therefore a cut off at high energies must exist .",
    "an interersting question which will be answered by glast is , at which energy this cutoff occurs .",
    "glast will continue the successful measurements of egret in a wider energy range , with a higher sensitivity and with a better location accuracy .",
    "its main instrument , the large - area telescope ( lat ) , will use the same physical processes as egret for the detection of @xmath0-rays , but using an advanced technical concept .",
    "it will consist of an array of towers of pair - conversion chamber stacks made from silicon - strip detectors .",
    "the lat measures @xmath0-rays in the energy range @xmath515 mev to @xmath5500 gev , reaching a point - source sensitivity of better than @xmath14 photons/(@xmath15 s ) above 100 mev for an observation time of one year .",
    "it will therefore be more than 30 times more sensitive than egret . within its large fov of @xmath163 sr",
    "it will locate point sources from 5 down to 30 \" . with its fairly good energy resolution of @xmath510% it will measure the energy spectra of sources with a high accuracy .",
    "the lat is devoted to the study of particle acceleration in the universe as it takes place in the nuclei of active galaxies , at or near pulsars , in supernova remnants and in interactions of the cosmic rays with the interstellar matter .",
    "in addition , it will detect @xmath550150 @xmath0-ray bursts per year . for a description of glast see @xcite .    from the latter measurements it is hoped to solve the afore - mentioned problem of the high - energy burst emission .",
    "however , the lat suffers from some deficiencies because high - energy measurements alone do not allow a unique classification of @xmath0-ray bursts , because the break energy @xmath6 of a burst lies below glast s energy threshold of @xmath515 mev .",
    "therefore without low - energy measurements a classification of the bursts is difficult , since most bursts were measured by batse at these energies and the connection to the batse data archive can not be established .",
    "another deficiency is that the trigger conditions of the lat for weak bursts are unfavourable because of the rather high background rate . in order to overcome these deficiencies",
    "a secondary instrument was proposed , the gbm .",
    "it will extend the energy range of glast towards lower energies and it will have a much larger fov than the lat . therefore it will detect more bursts than this instrument .",
    "the gbm will communicate the positions of these bursts to the lat which then will , after reorientation if needed , search for high - energy @xmath0-rays . moreover , for weak bursts the lat will use gbm - provided information to reduce background by eliminating events with directions far frm the gbm burst location .",
    "the goals of the gbm described above can be achieved by an arrangement of 12 thin nai discs which are oriented such that from the relative count rates the direction to the burst can be derived ( konus / batse principle ) .",
    "they will in addition measure the burst spectra in the energy range 5 kev - 1 mev .    in order to obtain spectral overlap with the lat",
    ", two cylindrical bgo crystals will be mounted to the glast spacecraft which are sensitive to @xmath0-rays in the energy range from 150 kev - 30 mev .",
    "a more detailed description of the gbm can be found in @xcite . within the large fov of @xmath58.6 sr @xmath5215 bursts / year",
    "will be detected by the gbm .",
    "most of them will be located on board in real time with an accuracy @xmath17 . on ground much better locations ( @xmath5@xmath18 ) can be derived .",
    "the 50300 kev sensitivity for nominal on - board triggers will be @xmath50.6 photons/(@xmath15 s ) , whereas an ultimate 5@xmath19 sensitivity of @xmath50.35 photons/(@xmath15 s ) can be achieved on ground .",
    "with the gbm continuous measurements of energy spectra from @xmath55 kev to @xmath530 mev will be performed .",
    "apart from spectra also the light curves of bursts will be recorded with a time resolution in the @xmath20s - range .",
    "the gbm will serve as a sensitive burst trigger for the lat and will communicate very rapidly ( @xmath165 s ) the burst location to it .",
    "this trigger will initialize data - reduction modes in the lat which will then observe the burst and localize it with a much better accuracy ( @xmath163 ) .",
    "this precise location will be communicated within less than 10 s to ground in order to allow a search for objects at other wavelengths .",
    "the burst data collected by the gbm will preserve the continuity to the batse data and enlarge this important archive .",
    "moreover the gbm will be part of the ipn as a near - earth burst detector .    with the gbm",
    "the relation between the kev - mev - gev emission can be investigated in great detail .",
    "time - resolved energy spectra will be measured allowing time - resolved spectroscopy ( see figure 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "this permits the investigation of the hard - to - soft evolution of the power - law index @xmath9 and the hardness - intensity correlation and tackles the problem of the narrowing of the peaks with energy .",
    "it may also give an answer to the question why the low - energy emission lasts longer than the high - energy one . together with the lat it will be possible to investigate these correlations to high energies with the aim to measure the suspected cutoff and to find a possible evolution of the spectral index @xmath10 .",
