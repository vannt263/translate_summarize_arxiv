    "the game _ toads and frogs _ , invented by richard guy , is extensively discussed in `` winning ways''[1 ] , the famous classic by elwyn berlekemp , john conway , and richard guy , that is the _ bible _ of combinatorial game theory .",
    "+ this game got so much coverage because of the simplicity and elegance of its rules , the beauty of its analysis , and as an example of a combinatorial game whose positions do not always have values that are numbers .",
    "+ the game is played on a @xmath2 strip with either toad(t ) , frog(f ) or @xmath3 on the squares .",
    "left plays t and right plays f. t may move to the immediate square on its right , if it happens to be empty , and f moves to the next empty square on the left , if it is empty .",
    "if t and f are next to each other , they have an option to jump over one another , in their designated directions , provided they land on an empty square .",
    "( see [ 1 ] page 14 ) .",
    "+ in symbols : the following moves are legal for toad : + @xmath4 , + @xmath5  , + and the following moves are legal for frog : + @xmath6 , + @xmath7 . + already in `` winning ways''[1 ] there is some analysis of toads and frogs positions , but on _ specific _ , small boards , such as @xmath8 . in 1996 , erickson[2 ] analyzed more general positions . at the end he made five conjectures about the values of some families of positions .",
    "all of them are starting positions ( positions where all t are rightmost and all f are leftmost ) .",
    "+ in [ 3 ] , we discussed the symbolic finite - state approach to prove the value of the positions in class a and b. however , the patterns of the value of toads and frogs game are not limited to only class a or class b. there are also patterns in the positions where the variables are on both t and f , for example @xmath9 . in this paper , we will analyze some of these positions .",
    "+ to be able to understand the present article , reader need a minimum knowledge of combinatorial game theory , that can be found in [ 1 ] .",
    "in particular , readers should be familiar with the notions of _ value _ of a game and sum games .",
    "+ let s recall the bypass reversible move rule , dominated options rule and inequality of two games .",

    "+ the general classes a and b are the more general positions of the classes a and b that we talked about in [ 3 ] . + for the general class",
    ", we can not apply the finite state method that we use in [ 3 ] anymore since we now have infinitely many positions that come from the combination of the two letters with symbols on them .",
    "however we manage to categorize all positions in the general class a1 , the class of all positions with exactly on @xmath3 .",
    "it is in fact the only general class that we manage to do it for .",
    "+ many positions in these classes do not have a nice compact formula ; for example in a2 , @xmath27 . on the other hand",
    ", many positions have a nice formula .",
    "we will prove some of the starting positions like @xmath28 later on in the appendix of this paper .",
    "+ once we detect the patterns of the positions , the proof is quite routine .",
    "we now do the proof of each specific position by hand with the help of a computer .",
    "we hope to see the computer playing more roles in assisting with the proofs in the future .",
    "we present the values of some starting positions in this section .",
