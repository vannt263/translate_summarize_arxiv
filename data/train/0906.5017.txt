    "with the rapid growth of the internet @xcite and the world - wide - web @xcite , a huge amount of data and resource is created and available for the public .",
    "this , however , may result in the problem of _ information overload _ : we face an excess amount of information , and are unable to find the relevant objects . in consequence",
    ", it is vital to study how to automatically extract the hidden information and make personalized recommendations .",
    "there have been a number of significant works trying to solve this problem .",
    "a landmark is the use of search engine @xcite .",
    "however , a search engine could only find the relevant web pages according to the input keywords and return the same results regardless of users habits and tastes .",
    "an alternative is the use of the recommender system @xcite , which is , essentially , an information filtering technique that attempts to present information likely of interest to the user . due to its significance for economy and society ,",
    "the design of efficient recommendation algorithms has become a common focus of branches of science ( see the review articles @xcite and the references therein ) .    typically , a recommender system compares the user s profile to some reference characteristics , and seeks to predict the ` rating ' that a user would give to an object he had not yet considered .",
    "the mainstream of recommendation algorithms can be divided into two categories @xcite : ( i ) the content - based methods in which the recommended objects are similar to those preferred by the target user in the past ; ( ii ) the collaborative filtering ( cf ) in which the recommended objects are popular among the users who have similar preferences with the target user . thus far , cf is the most successful method underlying recommender systems . over the last decade",
    "many algorithms under the cf framework have been proposed , including similarity based approaches @xcite , relevance models @xcite , matrix factorization techniques @xcite , iterative self - consistent refinement @xcite , and so on .",
    "a fundamental assumption of cf method is that , in a social network , those who agreed in the past tend to agree again in the future .",
    "the most commonly used algorithms in cf is a neighborhood - based approach , which works by first computing similarities between all pairs of users , and then to predict by integrating ratings of neighbors ( i.e. , those who having high similarities to the target user ) of the target user .",
    "algorithms within this family differ in the definition of similarity , formulation of neighborhoods and the computation of predictions .",
    "there are two main algorithmic techniques @xcite : user - based and object - based , which are mathematically equivalent by interchanging the roles of user and object ; in this paper , we will only consider the user - based technique . the most crucial step for collaborative filtering is to find a particular user s neighborhood with similar taste or interest and quantify the strength of similarity @xcite .",
    "various kinds of methods have been proposed on this issue ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for some recent works , to name just a few ) , among which the _ cosine similarity _ @xcite and the _ jaccard index _ @xcite are the most commonly used measurements .",
    "most of previous studies only consider the ratings given to the object , while neglect the content information .",
    "a possible reason is that the content information is hard to automatically extracted out , and how to properly make use of such information is not known well .",
    "very recently , collaborative tagging systems have been introduced into the studies of recommender systems @xcite . in collaborative tagging systems ( ctses ) , users are allowed to freely assign tags to their collections , which can both express users personalized preferences and describe the objects contents . in ref .",
    "@xcite , tags are incorporated to the standard cf algorithm by reducing the three - dimensional correlations to three two - dimensional correlations and then applying a fusion method to re - associate these correlation . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a recommendation algorithm via integrated diffusion on user - object - tag tripartite graphs is studied . in this paper , we propose a collaborative filtering algorithm based on a new measure of user similarity which integrates user preferences of both collected objects and used tags . we evaluate our method on a benchmark data set , _",
    "movielens_. experimental results demonstrate that our method can outperform the standard cf based on cosine and jaccard indices .",
    "is assigned a unit of resource ; plot ( b ) describes the result after the first - step diffusion , during which the resource is transferred equally from user @xmath0 to objects @xmath1 and tags @xmath2 ; eventually , the resources flow back to users , and we show the result in plot ( c ) . the values marked beside nodes in black and red are respectively denote the amounts of resource in the user - object and user - tag diffusions.,width=491 ]    .the best algorithmic performance for ranking score , recall and precision .",
    "ds and cs are abbreviations of diffusion similarity and cosine similarity .",
    "the numbers in the brackets are the corresponding optimal values of @xmath3 .",
    "the results reported here are consistent with what shown in figs .",
    "note that for all three metrics , the diffusion similarity performs much better than the cosine similarity .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in the system , there are three kinds of elements , users , objects and tags .",
    "each user has collected some objects and described them with tags .",
    "let @xmath4 be a set of @xmath5 users , @xmath6 be a set of @xmath7 objects , and @xmath8 be a set of @xmath9 tags .",
    "the relationships among the three sets can be described by a tripartite graph . in this paper",
    ", we are interested in the similarities among users , and thus can reduce this tripartite graph into two pair correlations : _ user - object _ and _ user - tag _ , which can be described by two adjacent matrices , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively . if user @xmath12 has collected object @xmath13 , we set @xmath14 , otherwise @xmath15 = 0 .",
    "analogously , we set @xmath16 if @xmath12 has used the tag @xmath17 , and @xmath18 otherwise .",
    "we use a diffusion process to obtain similarities between users @xcite . the basic idea",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . considering the user - object bipartite graph , and assume that a unit of resource ( e.g. recommender power ) is associated with the target user @xmath19 , which will be distributed to other users , such that each user gets a specific percentage .",
    "at the first step , the user @xmath19 distributes the resource equally to all the objects he has collected . after this step",
    ", the resource that object @xmath13 gets from @xmath19 reads @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the _ degree _ of @xmath19 in the user - object bipartite graph .",
    "then , at the second step , each object distributes it s resource equally to all the users having collected it .",
    "thus , resource that @xmath12 gets from @xmath19 , which we define as _ similarity _ between @xmath12 and @xmath19 with @xmath19 the target user ( note that , this similarity measure is asymmetry ) , is : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the degree of object @xmath13 in the user - object bipartite graph , and @xmath6 is the set of objects .",
    "analogously , considering the diffusion on the user - tag bipartite graph .",
    "suppose that a unit of resource is initially located on the target user @xmath19 , which will be equally distributed to all tags he has used , and then each tag redistributes the received resource to all its neighboring users .",
    "thus , we obtain tag - based similarity between user @xmath12 and @xmath19 ( with @xmath19 the target ) , as @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are respectively the degrees of tag @xmath27 and user @xmath19 in the user - tag bipartite graph , and @xmath8 is the set of tags .",
    "tso _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and zhang _",
    "_ @xcite have recently demonstrated the significance of making use of the ctses to improve the accuracy of recommendations .",
    "motivated by those results , we plan to integrate the above two diffusion - based similarities to get better recommendations . as a start point , in this paper , we adopt the simplest way , that is , to combine @xmath28 and @xmath29 linearly : @xmath30 where @xmath31 $ ] is a tunable parameter . for cosine and jaccard indices",
    ", we also firstly get the similarities respectively based on user - object and user - tag bipartite graphs , and then integrate them in a linear way as shown in eq .",
    "since the jaccrad index performs almost the same as the cosine similarity , this paper only reports the numerical results on cosine similarity .",
    "next , we apply the standard collaborative filtering for recommendation @xcite . given a target user @xmath19 and an uncollected object @xmath13",
    ", the preference of @xmath19 on @xmath13 is : @xmath32 we then sort all objects that user @xmath19 has not collected in the descending order of their scores , and the top @xmath33 objects will be recommended to @xmath19 .     versus @xmath3 .",
    "the results reported here are averaged over 5 independent runs , each of which corresponds to a random division of training set and testing set . @xmath3=0 and",
    "@xmath3=1 correspond to the cases for pure user - tag and user - object diffusions , respectively .",
    "the two curves are corresponding to diffusion - based similarity ( lower black ) and cosine similarity ( upper red ) , respectively .",
    "the smaller value indicates the higher accuracy of recommendation algorithm.,width=377 ]",
    "in this paper , we use a benchmark data , _ movielens _ ( http://www.grouplens.org ) , to evaluate our proposed algorithm .",
    "_ movielens _ is a movie rating system , where each user votes movies in five discrete ratings 1 - 5 and a tagging function was added since january 2006 . with the help of collaborative tags , users can look into the pool of movies that are assigned with the same tag .",
    "we here only consider the objects and tags having been collected and used by at least two users , and the users who have collected and used at least one object and one tag .",
    "the sampling data consists of 3710 users , 5724 objects and 5228 tags , with 53091 user - object and 33065 user - tag relations . to test the algorithmic performance , in each run ,",
    "the data set is randomly divided into two parts : the training set contains 90% of entries , and the remaining 10% constitutes the testing set .    . the results reported here",
    "are averaged over 5 independent runs , each of which corresponds to a random division of training set and testing set . @xmath3=0 and",
    "@xmath3=1 correspond to the cases for pure user - tag and user - object diffusions , respectively .",
    "the higher value indicates the higher accuracy of recommendation algorithm.,width=377 ]      we employ three metrics , _ ranking score _ ( ranks ) @xcite , _ recall _ @xcite and _ precision _",
    "@xcite , to investigate the performance of the proposed algorithm , the former one takes into account the whole rank of objects and the latter two concern only the objects with the highest scores , i.e. , the recommended objects .    1 .   _",
    "ranks _ describes the position of the uncollected objects .",
    "that is , if the edge @xmath34 ( @xmath12 is a user and @xmath13 is an object ) is in the testing set , we calculate the position of @xmath13 of all the uncollected objects of @xmath12 , and denote it as @xmath35 .",
    "for example , if there are 100 uncollected objects for @xmath36 and @xmath13 is put in the third , then @xmath37 .",
    "since the objects in the testing set are actually collected by users , smaller @xmath35 is favored .",
    "the average of @xmath35 over all user - object pairs in the testing set defines the average ranking score , as : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the set of user - object pairs in the testing set , @xmath40 is the number of elements in @xmath39 . clearly , the smaller the @xmath41 , the higher the accuracy .",
    "recall_. _ recall _ is the ratio of relevant objects in the recommendation list to the total number of the relevant objects ( i.e. , the total number of user - object pairs in the testing set ) .",
    "it reads @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the number of recommended objects for user @xmath12 that are indeed in the testing set .",
    "@xmath44 depends on the length of recommendation list , and the larger the @xmath44 the higher the accuracy .",
    "precision_. _ precision _ is the ratio of relevant objects in the recommendation list to the total number of the recommended objects .",
    "it reads @xmath45 @xmath46 depends on the length of recommendation list , and the larger the @xmath46 the higher the accuracy .",
    "figure 2 shows the @xmath41 of the two kinds of similarities , diffusion - based similarity and cosine similarity , as a function of the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "it can be seen that both two kinds of similarities can get benefit by making use of tag information , namely can reach lower @xmath41 with proper @xmath3 . comparing with the algorithm without tag information , at the optimal values ,",
    "the improvements for diffusion - based similarity and cosine similarity are 4.83% and 2.62% , respectively .",
    "in addition , the diffusion - based similarity performs better that the cosine similarity under the standard cf framework .",
    "figure 3 reports _ recall _ as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "since the typical length for recommendation list is tens , our experimental study focuses on the interval @xmath47 $ ] . to keep the figure neat , we only show the results for @xmath48 and @xmath49 , with @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "different from the case of @xmath51 , the tag information does not contribute much to the _ recall _ for cosine similarity , and it contributes some but not much to the diffusion - based similarity .",
    "this may be caused by the data sparsity for user - tag relations , which is known as a typical reason leading to the ineffectiveness of cf .",
    "there are almost the same number of objects and tags ( 5724 vs. 5228 ) , but the number of user - tag relations is 60% less than that of user - object relations . that is to say",
    ", the density of data may also be a crucial ingredient for recommendation of collaborative tagging systems , and only if the tag information is rich , one can get benefit from it .",
    "similar results for precision are presented in fig .",
    "4 . in table 1",
    ", we summarize the optimal values for the three accuracy metrics , which again demonstrate that the diffusion - based similarity could provide remarkably better recommendations than the cosine similarity .    .",
    "the results reported here are averaged over 5 independent runs , each of which corresponds to a random division of training set and testing set .",
    "@xmath3=0 and @xmath3=1 correspond to the cases for pure user - tag and user - object diffusions , respectively .",
    "the higher value indicates the higher accuracy of recommendation algorithm.,width=377 ]",
    "in this paper , we proposed an integrated diffusion - based similarity with the help of tag information .",
    "experimental results demonstrate that the tag information can be used to improve the accuracy of recommendations .",
    "in addition , the diffusion - based similarity works much better than the cosine and jaccard similarity .",
    "there are many topology - based similarity indices , some of them are based on local information , while others require global knowledge of network structure ( see references @xcite ) .",
    "some of them can not be easily extended to the bipartite graphs ( e.g. , katz index , average commute time , etc . ) and the calculation of global indices is very time consuming .",
    "since the diffusion - based similarity requires no more calculation than the cosine and jaccard indices , we believe it could find the application in real recommender systems .",
    "the present algorithm depends on a free parameter @xmath3 . in the case of @xmath52",
    ", it degenerates to the algorithm not making use of tag information at all .",
    "therefore , to compare the @xmath52 case with the optimal case , one could see how tag information can help improving the algorithmic accuracy .",
    "an interesting result is that the diffusion - based similarity can make better use of tag information than the cosine and jaccard indices .",
    "in addition , in comparison to the results reported by zhang _",
    "@xcite , the present algorithm has much higher values of recall .",
    "the collaborative tagging systems are playing more and more important role in the internet world , and we must be aware of their significance .",
    "experimental results in this paper strongly suggest using the tag information to improve the quality of recommendations",
    ". indeed , we should encourage users to try to experience online systems with tags , particularly for organizing personal interests .",
    "although in the beginning , users may assign each object with arbitrary number of tags , previous researches have revealed that the tag vocabulary will grow in a sub - linear way both in open @xcite and canonical @xcite systems .",
    "in addition , in the statistically level , the number of tags associated with each tagging action will converge to a certain value @xcite .",
    "this paper only provides a simple beginning for the design of recommendation algorithms making use of tag information .",
    "there are still many open issues remain for the further study .",
    "first , the more in - depth understanding of the structure of collaborative tagging systems would be helpful for generating better recommendations .",
    "second , since the tag information is considered to be a meaningful accessory towards semantic relations for users and objects @xcite , despite its sparsity problems , it should draw potential yet promising relations for personalized recommendation via community detection algorithms . finally , this work only considers the unweighted case for user - tag relations , however , a user may assign different objects the same tag , making a weighted relations between users and tags .",
    "study of the weighted version may give more insights and further improvements of recommender systems .",
