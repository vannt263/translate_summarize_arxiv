    "the global organization of complex molecular interactions within and across cells is being disclosed by the graph - theoretic approaches  @xcite .",
    "the obtained cellular networks exhibit universal topological features which are rarely found in random networks , such as broad degree distributions  @xcite and high modularity  @xcite .",
    "their origins and implications to cellular and larger - scale functions have thus been of great interest .",
    "diverse network models based on simple mechanisms of adding and removing nodes and links have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "those models capture the common aspects , like the preferential attachment  @xcite , of biological processes such as the duplication , divergence , and recruitment of genes , proteins , and enzymes , and successfully reproduce the empirical features of biological networks , suggesting that the former can be the origin of the latter .",
    "yet it remains to be explored what drives such construction and remodeling of biological networks functioning in living organisms .",
    "a population of living organisms find the typical architecture and function of their cellular networks changing with time .",
    "such changes on long time scales are made by the organisms of different traits , giving birth to their descendants with different chances , that is , by evolution  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to investigate how the generic features of evolution lead to the emergence of the common features of biological networks .",
    "living organisms are required to possess adaptability and stability simultaneously  @xcite . to survive and give birth to descendants in fluctuating environments ,",
    "the ability to adjust to a changed environment is essential  @xcite , which leads to , e.g. , phenotypic diversity and the advantage of bet - hedging strategy  @xcite . at the same time , the ability to maintain the constant structure and perform routine important functions regularly , such as cell division and heat beats , is highly demanded .",
    "therefore , in a given population , the cellular networks supporting higher adaptability and stability are more likely to be inherited , which leads the representative topology and function of the cellular networks to evolve over generations .    here",
    "we study how such evolutionary pressure shapes the biological networks .",
    "we propose a network model , in which links are rewired such that both adaptability and stability are enhanced .",
    "the dynamics of the network is simply represented by the boolean variables assigned to each node regulating one another  @xcite .",
    "the boolean networks have been instrumental for studying the gene transcriptional regulatory networks  @xcite and the metabolic networks  @xcite .",
    "this model network is supposed to represent the network structure typical of a population .",
    "the evolution of boolean networks towards enhancing adaptability  @xcite , stability  @xcite , or both  @xcite has been studied , mostly by applying the genetic algorithm or similar ones to a group of small networks . in particular , the model networks which evolve by rewiring links towards local dynamics being neither active nor inactive",
    "have been shown to reproduce the critical global connectivity and many of the universal features of real - world biological networks  @xcite , demonstrating the close relation between evolution and the structure of biological networks .",
    "however , the evolutionary evaluation and selection are made for each whole organism , not for part of it . in the simulated evolution of our model ,",
    "the adaptability and the stability of the _ global _ dynamical state are evaluated in the wild - type network and its mutant network , differing by a single link from each other , and the winner of the two becomes the wild - type in the next step .",
    "the study of this model leads us to find that sparse and heterogeneous connectivity patterns emerge , which are consistent with the gene transcriptional regulatory networks and the metabolic networks of diverse species .",
    "the scaling behavior of stability with respect to system size suggests that the evolved networks are critical , lying at the boundary between the inflexible ordered phase and the unstable chaotic phase .",
    "our study also shows how the nature of fluctuations and correlations changes by evolution .",
    "the extent of perturbation spread characterizing the system s stability fluctuates over different realizations of evolution .",
    "the fluctuation turns out to scale linearly with the mean in the stationary state of evolution while the square - root scaling holds in the transient period .",
    "we argue that this dynamic crossover is rooted in the variation of the combinatorial impacts of the structural fluctuation , driven by evolution , and the internal stochasticity .",
    "the scaling of the correlation volume , representing the typical number of nodes correlated with a node , is another feature of the evolved networks .",
    "our results thus show the universal impacts of biological evolution on the structure and function of biological networks and illuminate the nature of correlations and fluctuations in such evolving systems distinguished from randomly - constructed or other artificial systems .",

    "the arguments explain the crossover in the fluctuation scaling of perturbation spread shown in fig .",

    "our results can be compared with the other cases showing a crossover in the fluctuation scaling driven by the change of the dominant fluctuation between @xmath233 and @xmath234  @xcite . on the other hand , @xmath234 is always dominant in our model .",
    "the time - varying perturbation spread is dominantly governed by the structure component @xmath208 in the transient period and the internal dynamics component @xmath207 in the stationary state , which underlies the crossover of @xmath163 from @xmath123 to @xmath8 in our model .",
    "the rapid and significant changes of the structure of the evolving networks are identified only in the transient period , and the internal stochasticity dominates the statistics of stability in the stationary state of evolution .",
    "therefore the nature of fluctuations is fundamentally different between the evolved networks and the random network or those which are not sufficiently evolved .",

    "in this work we have introduced and extensively investigated the characteristic properties of an adaptive network model capturing the generic features of biological evolution . in reality , the evolutionary selections are made for a population of heterogeneous living organisms , as adopted by the genetic algorithm , but here we considered a simplified model , where a single network , representing the network structure typical of a population of organisms , add or remove a link depending on whether that change improves its fitness or not .",
    "the fitness of a network is evaluated in terms of its adaptability to a changing environment and the stability against perturbations in the dynamical state , which look contradictory to each other but essential for every living organism . despite such simplification",
    ", the model network reproduces many of the universal network characteristics of evolving organisms , including the sparsity and scaling of the mean connectivity , broad degree distributions , and stability stronger than the random boolean networks but weaker than the networks evolved towards stability only , implying the simultaneous support of adaptability and robustness .",
    "fluctuations and correlations display characteristic scaling behaviors in the stationary state of evolution contrasted to those in the transient period or in the initial random - network state .",
    "the evolutionary pressure drives the regulatory networks towards becoming highly stable by exploiting different pathways from realization to realization in the rugged fitness landscape , which results in a large fluctuation .",
    "the presence of two distinct components in the perturbation - spread dynamics , related to the different network structure depending on the evolution pathway and the location of random initial perturbation , respectively , is shown to bring the dynamic crossover in the fluctuation scaling .",
    "such evolution makes large correlations as well .",
    "the proposed model is simple and generic allowing us to understand the evolutionary origin of the universal features of diverse biological networks .",
    "it illuminates the nature of dynamic fluctuations and correlations in evolving networks that are continuously influenced by the changing environments .",
    "the ensemble of those evolving networks can be formulated by the hamiltonian approach , which depends on a time - varying external environment , and thus it opens a way to study biological evolution from the viewpoint of statistical mechanics .",
    "given the increasing importance of the capacity to manipulate biological systems , natural or synthetic , our understanding of biological fluctuations can be particularly useful .",
    "the strong interaction with environments , like the natural selection in evolution , is common to diverse complex systems and thus the theoretical framework to deal with multiple components of dynamics presented here can be of potential use in substantiating the theory of complex systems .",
