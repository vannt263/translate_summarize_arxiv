    "along the minor axis we observe a clear blue gradient in @xmath59 within @xmath63 arcsec , while the @xmath58 profile in this region is very irregular and likely reflects both internal structure as well as dust within the disc .",

    "the colour measurements are rather noisy due to the very low surface brightness , but still there is evidence for @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "we also estimate the total magnitude of the galaxy , of the disc alone , and of the galaxy excluding the disc in each band ( see table [ magtab ] ) .",

    "our analysis of the udf galaxy , combo-17 # 31611 , has yielded the detection of a very low surface brightness structural component in addition to the bright disc .",
    "the main evidence for this component is : _",
    "i ) _ excess emission with respect to an exponential profile detected to @xmath74 arcsec ( @xmath7514 kpc ) from the disc plane at the level of @xmath76 mag  arcsec@xmath2 ; _ ii ) _ the isophotal shape is centrally - concentrated and becomes rounder with increasing radius , reaching @xmath5 at the faintest measured isophote ; _ iii ) _ colours far from the plane that are distinct from the disc , i.e.  @xmath77 and @xmath78 which are 0.2 - 0.3 and 0.1 mag redder than the disc respectively . based on these properties",
    ", we attribute this component to the stellar halo of the galaxy , making it the most distant detection of a stellar halo yet known .",
    "we note the striking resemblance between the halo properties derived here and those of the `` mean '' halo detected in z04 s sdss stacking analysis .",
    "as discussed in z04 , these observations are also consistent with the few extant observations of individual stellar haloes .",
    "the surface brightness profile of the halo is consistent with a power - law falling as @xmath79 .",
    "this slope must be considered an upper limit since if there is contaminating outer disc emission within our aperture , it will steepen the observed profiles even beyond 1 arcsec .",
    "an @xmath80 law provides a poor fit to the data , which display excess emission at the faintest surface brightness levels compared to this profile .",
    "less concentrated srsic profiles , which are more appropriate for the small bulges of late - type galaxies , provide even worse fits , thus ruling out the bulge as responsible for the measured emission .",
    "the fractional contribution of the halo to the total galaxy light is around 5 per cent , but this should be considered only approximate since we neglect disc contamination in the region where the halo light is integrated and include the inner halo as part of the disc light .",
    "furthermore , we have no handle on internal extinction which could be significant in the inner regions of the galaxy , where the disc contribution is calculated .    in order to conduct a direct comparison between the surface brightness and colours of this distant stellar halo and those of local galaxies ,",
    "corrections need to be applied for bandpass shifting and surface brightness dimming . given the photometric redshift of 0.322 , the four observed bands , @xmath81 correspond rather well to the sdss @xmath82 bands at redshift zero . assuming a 9  gyr , @xmath83 single stellar population ( ssp ) , we use the @xcite ( hereafter bc03 ) models to calculate that observed surface brightnesses in @xmath84 translate into rest - frame values of @xmath85 mag  arcsec@xmath2 brighter in @xmath86 .",
    "our measurements of @xmath1 mag  arcsec@xmath2 thus correspond to rest - frame equivalents of @xmath3 mag  arcsec@xmath2 .",
    "this is precisely the surface brightness range in which a power - law halo component starts to dominate the minor axis profile in z04 s sdss stacking analysis and in which direct detections of individual haloes have been made in nearby galaxies .",
    "+ we proceed to use the bc03 models to interpret the colours of the halo emission in terms of stellar populations .",
    "first , we compare the observed colours with predictions for different ssps with ages of 213  gyr and metallicities of 0.0052.5  @xmath87 adopting a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "we find none of these models can simultaneously reproduce the intermediate @xmath59 and the very red @xmath58 colours . unless a super - solar metallicity is assumed ( @xmath88 ) ,",
    "the measured @xmath77 is at least 0.15 mag redder than the models and thus inconsistent at more than the 1.5 @xmath35 level .",
    "such an anomaly is reminiscent of the finding of a correspondingly high @xmath89 by z04 , despite the intermediate @xmath90 that could be accounted for by an old population with roughly solar metal enrichment .",
    "+ since we have been unable to produce a model that provides a good fit to the observed colours at @xmath4 , we adopt the following strategy to derive rest - frame colours that can be compared to haloes in the local universe . we adopt a fiducial reference model of an ssp of age 9  gyr at the redshift of the galaxy , with @xmath91 , and a chabrier imf ( bc03 ) ; this model minimises the absolute deviations from the observed colours .",
    "we then evolve the spectrum to @xmath92 and derive the rest - frame colours that would be observed through sdss @xmath86 passbands .",
    "these colours can then be directly compared to the measurements of z04 for the @xmath12mean  halo in their sdss stack .",
    "not unexpectedly , the evolved colours do not provide a good match to z04 s observations but interestingly the offset between the model and observations is of the same magnitude and sense at @xmath92 as at @xmath4 . specifically , while the model predicts a blue colour ( @xmath59 or sdss @xmath93 ) that is consistent or just slightly redder than the observations , the predicted red colour ( @xmath58 or sdss @xmath94 ) is too blue by @xmath95 mag . +",
    "this kind of colour anomaly , i.e.  too much flux in the spectral region around 7500  with respect to shorter optical wavelengths , was also seen in the stellar halo of the nearby system ngc  5907 @xcite .",
    "an attempt to directly resolve the population of metal - rich giant stars that would give rise to these red colours was unsuccessful , leading to the suggestion that the stellar halo in ngc  5907 formed with a non - standard imf that is dominated by @xmath96 stars @xcite .",
    "while such a truncation could account for the lack of halo giant stars , it is unclear whether it could also explain the colours observed here , i.e.  @xmath93 typical of g - k stars yet @xmath94 typical of m stars .",
    "another possibility is that the red colour is contaminated by ionised gas emission .",
    "deep @xmath97 imagery of nearby galaxies often reveals faint extraplanar emission @xcite , however little is known about the extent of these ionised `` haloes '' at very faint flux levels .",
    "further investigation is clearly required in order to understand the origin of the peculiar halo colours , which have now been measured in three independent studies .    as a final remark",
    ", we note that the surface brightness profile of the disc can be fitted by an exponential function that changes scalelength abruptly at 3  arcsec  @xmath98 ( corresponding to @xmath99 inner scalelengths ) .",
    "this behaviour is consistent with deep imaging studies of both edge - on and face - on discs in the local universe @xcite and likely reflects a truncation of the bright inner disc .",
    "that this radius also represents the point where the major axis colour gradient reverses and starts to redden is intriguing and suggests that the stellar populations at the far extremity of the disc are of significant age ."
