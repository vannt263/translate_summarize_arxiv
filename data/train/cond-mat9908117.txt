    "the physics of vortex lines in high - temperature superconductors has attracted much experimental and theoretical interest  @xcite .",
    "the competition between interactions , pinning , and thermal fluctuations gives rise to a wide range of novel phenomena that are both interesting in their own right and technologically important . here",
    ", we focus primarily on the effects of disorder on vortex behavior , phenomena which are also important for low - temperature type ii superconductors . in a disorder - free sample",
    ", vortex lines always flow in response to a current , leading to a resistance even at arbitrarily small currents .",
    "by contrast , defects in superconductors attract vortex lines . just as a few nails",
    "can hold a carpet in place , an entire vortex line system can be held in place by a few defects , leading to a large critical current  provided the vortices are in a solid phase , where they are held in place relative to each other by their mutual repulsion , which gives rise to a shear modulus . if the temperature is raised so that the vortices are in a liquid state , then vortices held in place by the disorder are pinned , but the other vortices can flow around them , leading again to zero critical current .    in the case of the high - temperature superconductors",
    ", disorder is naturally present in the form of oxygen vacancies .",
    "the quantity of such vacancies can be altered by changing the doping of the crystal , _",
    "i.e. _ , by introducing more or less oxygen during the growth process .",
    "such changes can have a strong impact on the pinning of the vortices , and hence on the critical current .",
    "substitutional defects can play a similar role in low - temperature superconductors .",
    "artificial defects added to superconductors are particularly effective in increasing the critical current .",
    "of special note are columnar defects , which are generated by bombarding the sample with heavy ions that produce damage tracks in their wake  @xcite .",
    "these tracks pin vortices strongly because their width ( @xmath8 ) is comparable to the vortex core size ( @xmath9 ) . when the columnar pins are aligned with the direction of the magnetic field ( and hence with the vortex lines ) a large increase in the critical current",
    "is observed .",
    "however , an even greater increase in the critical current is observed when the columns are splayed , _",
    "i.e. _ , they are not all oriented in the same direction  @xcite .",
    "the superior pinning properties of columnar defects with controlled splay was predicted theoretically based on expected reduction in a variable - range hopping vortex transport mechanism and enhanced vortex entanglement due to splay  @xcite . despite the technological importance ,",
    "much remains to be done in order to understand the behavior of vortex lines in the presence of splayed columnar disorder .    even at high temperatures , when the analysis is expected to be most tractable , standard approaches seem to break down and give nonsensical results . for example , the boson mapping  @xcite works quite well in describing many of the properties of vortex lines in the presence of point or unsplayed columnar disorder .",
    "this approach utilizes a formal correspondence between vortex trajectories and the world lines of fictitious quantum - mechanical bosons in two dimensions . in this analogy",
    ", the temperature @xmath10 plays the role of planck s constant @xmath11 , the bending energy ( or line tension ) @xmath12 plays the role of the boson mass @xmath13 , and the length of the sample @xmath14 corresponds to @xmath15 for the bosons .",
    "the analogy works best in the @xmath16 limit , which corresponds to the @xmath17 limit for the bosons . in this limit , in the absence of disorder and interactions , the bosons should form a condensate . in the presence of disorder or interactions ,",
    "some `` bosons '' are kicked out of the condensate , resulting in a condensate density @xmath18 which is less than the total density @xmath19 . for vortex lines ,",
    "the `` condensate density '' is a measure of the degree of entanglement  @xcite .",
    "this condensate density can be calculated for the various types of disorder discussed above .",
    "it is well - behaved for point and unsplayed columnar disorder , but in the presence of even weak splayed columnar disorder , @xmath18 diverges  @xcite , suggesting that the boson mapping is flawed in the presence of splayed columnar disorder .",
    "indeed , tuber and nelson  @xcite conclude that the super - diffusive wandering of the flux lines causes the mapping onto non - relativistic bosons to break down .",
    "unfortunately , this mapping  which has provided many insights for the cases of no disorder , point disorder , and unsplayed columnar defects",
    " seems to be less suitable for understanding the behavior of vortex lines in the presence of splayed columnar disorder .    here , we focus on the behavior of vortex lines near @xmath2 , where the lines are dilute .",
    "in particular , we predict the @xmath20 constitutive relation for vortex lines in the presence of the various types of disorder discussed above .",
    "we begin by reviewing the traditional abrikosov result , expected to hold in the absence of disorder and thermal fluctuations .",
    "each vortex that enters the sample will gain a free energy proportional to @xmath21 per unit length .",

    "the experiment was done by attaching a thin sheet of superconducting 2h - nbse@xmath41 to a high-@xmath42 micro - electromechanical device , and measuring the resonance frequency of torsional oscillations of the sample . because a sample with a magnetic moment @xmath43 in a field @xmath44 exerts an additional torque @xmath45 on the oscillator , the magnetic field which penetrates and becomes trapped in the sample can be probed by finding shifts in the resonance frequency as a function of applied field @xmath1 .",

    "however , the decades - old data is too rough to allow quantitative comparison with the prediction for point disorder @xmath37 .",
    "we approach these problems differently for the different types of disorder .",
    "parallel columnar disorder localizes vortices into finite transverse regions of the sample in both 1 + 1 and 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "therefore , at low densities , the vortices can easily avoid paying a large cost associated with their mutual repulsion if they are located in different areas of the sample . in the language of the boson mapping",
    "described above , we can approximate the intervortex interactions as merely restricting the occupancy of any given localized state to precisely one boson  @xcite .",

    "by contrast , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec - burgers ] , in the presence of point disorder or splayed columnar disorder , noninteracting vortices will be in extended states .",

    "this problem has been studied extensively for random potentials uncorrelated in space and time ( appropriate to point disorder for the vortex lines )  @xcite , but more recently has also been investigated for correlated potentials  @xcite . provided we restrict ourselves to the case where the splayed columnar defects are nearly isotropically oriented , we can use previous results for the wandering exponent @xmath48 , which describes how far the vortex line wanders transverse to the magnetic field in a distance @xmath49 in the field direction by the formula @xmath50 ^ 2 } \\right\\}^{1/2 } \\sim l^{\\zeta}$ ] , where @xmath51 labels the transverse coordinates of the flux line .",
