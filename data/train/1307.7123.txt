    "binary - star studies are valuable for what they provide directly ( e.g. , stellar masses ) , as well as for the information they provide about the configurations resulting from star - formation processes .",
    "this topic was particularly well developed in a classical series of studies by abt and collaborators .",
    "for instance , abt , gomez , & levy ( 1990 ) discussed this question for late b stars .    for several decades ,",
    "binary - star studies have been the beneficiary of developments in observational techniques , particularly those providing high spatial resolution and access to new wavelength regions .",
    "a clear demonstration of progress in this area was the discussion by duquennoy & mayor ( 1991 ) of the binary properties of solar - mass stars .",
    "they combined extensive coravel radial - velocity ( rv ) observations with results from visual binaries and common - proper - motion stars to explore distributions of mass ratios and eccentricities at all separations . recently",
    "this work has been updated by raghavan et al .",
    "( 2010 ) to include new advances in high - resolution techniques ( long - baseline interferometry and speckle interferometry ) .",
    "stars more massive than solar type are more difficult to study , because they are rarer , and hence more distant , and also because they have broad spectral lines , which limit the accuracy of rvs .",
    "however , new observational techniques have likewise greatly enhanced the knowledge of their properties ( e.g. , kobulnicky & fryer 2007 ; kouwenhoven et al .  2007 ; mason et al .",
    "2009 ; sana & evans 2011 ) .",
    "sana & evans , for instance , find a fairly constant fraction ( 44% ) of spectroscopic binaries among ob stars in several nearby open clusters .",
    "systems with small mass ratios ( i.e. , low secondary masses ) are the most difficult to identify .",
    "evans et al .",
    "( 2011a ) have used a different approach to determine the fraction of b stars with low - mass companions .",
    "since late b stars produce x - rays very rarely , the fraction of late b stars in the young cluster tr  16 ( associated with @xmath4  car ) that were detected in x - rays provides the fraction ( 3239% ) which have young low - mass companions .",
    "comparing the observed properties of binary and multiple systems with star - formation calculations is a test of the model predictions .",
    "an obvious first step of this approach is a comparison of the properties of binary systems containing high- and low - mass primary stars , but our knowledge of binaries among intermediate- and high - mass stars is still not as extensive as it is for solar - mass stars .",
    "this paper is the first in a series aimed at determining the properties of binary systems containing cepheid variables .",
    "cepheids are stars of intermediate masses , ranging from about 4 to @xmath6 ; in this paper we will use @xmath7 as the typical cepheid mass .",
    "cepheids are particularly useful for determining binary properties for several reasons .",
    "they have narrow spectral lines , providing accurate rvs from optical spectroscopy .",
    "if a cepheid has a fairly high - mass companion , the companion will dominate the light of the system in the ultraviolet ( uv ) , thus immediately demonstrating that the system is a binary .",
    "this further makes it possible to determine masses by measuring the orbital velocity amplitude of the companion in the uv , for example by using _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) spectra ( e.g. , evans et al .",
    "the combination of the optical and uv rv curves provides the mass ratio , and if the mass of the hot companion is inferred from its spectral type , the actual mass of the cepheid .",
    "such studies provide direct evidence on the distribution of mass ratios in binaries containing cepheids ( e.g. , evans 1995 ) .",
    "they also provide information about the fraction of triple systems ( evans et al .",
    "2005 ) , because the companions can be directly studied in the uv .",
    "a number of cepheid - containing triple systems have been identified through rv variability of the companions ( or inferred from the orbital mass functions ) . as compared with a sample of single - lined spectroscopic binaries , the ability to directly observe the companions",
    "provides a much higher detection rate of triples .",
    "this paper focuses on a complete sample of b- and early a - type companions of cepheid variables , which was obtained through a survey with the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( _ iue _ ) satellite , as described in  2 .",
    "this approach has the strength that the survey is sensitive to binary companions at all possible separations .",
    "by contrast , rv studies only find the close systems .",
    "conversely , the limitation of this approach is that it does not detect low - mass companions .",
    "the properties of the massive companion set include a few results from our recent _ hst _ snapshot imaging survey of cepheids with the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3)to be described in more detail in a subsequent paper  as well as orbital information on our sample from the literature . in the following sections we discuss the construction of the sample , the derivation of the orbital separations and mass ratios , their distribution functions , and some implications of our results .",
    "in order to have a well - defined sample , we start with a spectroscopic survey of all 76 galactic cepheids brighter than visual magnitude 8 , which was carried out with the _ iue _ satellite by one of us ( evans 1992a ) .",
    "these spectra , obtained with _ iue _",
    "s lwp and lwr cameras , covered the near - ultraviolet ( nuv ) wavelength range 2000 to 3200   . from this study we selected the cepheids",
    "for which _ iue _ revealed a companion of spectral type a2  v or earlier , corresponding to companion masses greater than about @xmath8 ( e.g. , harmanec 1988 ) .",
    "these are highly probable physical companions , because the rarity of a- and b - type stars in the field makes it very unlikely that such a star would be within the _ iue _ aperture by chance .",
    "the sensitivity of this _ iue _ survey to hot companions varies somewhat from star to star , because of differences in the intrinsic luminosity of the cepheids , differences in the pulsation phases ( hence magnitude and color ) at the time of the observation , and different exposure times .",
    "one product of the survey was a list of the spectral types of the brightest companions of each cepheid that would _ not _ have been detected ( evans 1992a , table  1c ) .",
    "these limits were generally mid - a spectral types , but they were early a for some , and late  b for four stars .    of the complete sample of 76 cepheids observed in the nuv with _ iue _ ,",
    "15 of them had detected a- or b - type companions ( evans 1992a , table  3a ) . to this list",
    "we have added three more cepheids : ( 1 )  v636  sco and t  vul , because hot companions of both stars were detected with the _ iue _ far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) spectrograph and swp camera ( evans 1992b , table  3b ) .",
    "they were not evident on the 2000 to 3200   exposures presumably because of the phase of the cepheid .",
    "( 2 )  @xmath9 cep itself , because trigonometric parallaxes obtained with the fine guidance system ( fgs ) on _ hst _ showed that the cepheid and its @xmath10 b - type companion hd 213307 are at the same distance ( benedict et al .",
    "our list of the 18 cepheids with companions of @xmath11 or more is given in table  1 .",
    "for each cepheid that had a detected hot companion , spectral types are available from _ iue _ observations in the fuv spectral range ( 11501950   ) .",
    "fuv spectra of late b and early a stars are particularly sensitive to temperature changes , and such companions completely dominate the spectra , so the spectral types are tightly constrained .",
    "the spectral classifications were derived by comparison with _ iue _ swp spectra of mk standard stars . because the spectral energy distribution is so temperature - sensitive , many of the companions were found to have spectral types lying between those of the mk standards , resulting in fractional spectral types such as b9.8  v. table  1 lists the spectral types for the companions and the references from which they were taken ( cols.2 and 3 ) .",
    "many of the cited sources provide plots directly comparing the companion spectra with those of mk standards .",
    "masses of the companions were derived from their spectral types , and are given in col .  4 of table  1 .",
    "for the late b and early a companions , the large luminosity difference between the cepheid and the companion means that the companion can be assumed to lie on the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) . for the zams , we use the harmanec ( 1988 ) calibration of masses vs.  spectral types .",
    "the masses for these stars in table  1 are mostly taken from evans ( 1995 ) , but are new values for @xmath4  aql , su  cas , s  nor , t  vul , and the systems discussed below .",
    "table  1 also contains three hotter companions , some of which may have evolved beyond the zams ; these objects were discussed by evans ( 1994 ) .",
    "masses for ax cir , bp cir ( overtone mode ) , and v659 cen are from fig .  7 in that paper , and are based on the geneva evolutionary tracks , which include mild core convective overshoot .",
    "a few companion masses in table 1 require further discussion .",
    "( 1 )  _ @xmath9  cep _ : the spectral type and mass for the companion , hd  213307 , are taken from benedict et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "( 2 )  _ s  mus _ : the companion spectral type was derived from _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( _ fuse _ ) spectra ( evans et al .",
    "2006 ) , from which the mass was derived as discussed in that paper .",
    "( 3 )  _ aw  per _ : the cepheid and its companion have been rediscussed by massa & evans ( 2008 ) , who derived a temperature for the hottest companion of @xmath12  k. this effective temperature is used with the harmanec relation to derive the mass and spectral type given in table  1 .",
    "massa & evans confirm , however , that the secondary is itself a binary based on the mass function of the spectroscopic orbit .",
    "( 4 )  _ t  mon _ : from _ hst _ high - resolution uv spectra , evans et al .  ( 1999 ) found that the companion is a magnetic chemically peculiar ap star , very similar to @xmath13  cvn , and also a binary .",
    "the companion mass is taken from that paper .",
    "table 1 contains a sample of intermediate - mass companions of @xmath0@xmath7 stars with uniquely complete information over the full range range of separations . however , there are some further points that need to be addressed .",
    "as is typical of massive stars , there is a high fraction of triple systems in this list of binaries ( evans et al .",
    "the spectral types and masses in table  1 pertain to the hottest companion star in the system , but there may be additional system members .",
    "two examples are as follows .",
    "( 1 )  w  sgr is a spectroscopic binary with a period of 1780  days , and _ iue _ revealed an a0  v companion . however , spatially resolved uv spectra obtained by evans et al.(2009 ) with the _ hst _ space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) showed that the a0  v star is resolved from the cepheid at a separation of @xmath14 , based on an analysis of stis spectra taken at several telescope roll angles .",
    "thus the a0  v star is not the secondary component in the 1780-day binary , and the system is a triple . ( 2 )  v1334 cyg is a single - lined spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of 1938  days ( evans 2000 ) , and a b7  v companion detected by _",
    "v1334  cyg is cataloged as the resolved double star ads  14859 , with several reports of a companion being seen by visual observers at separations of @xmath15@xmath16 ; if so , v1334  cyg would also be a triple system .",
    "however , neither _ hst _ fgs interferometry nor foc imaging ( 19982000 ) were able to resolve the visual companion , nor were there any convincing detections of a companion in speckle - interferometry measurements between 1976 and 2005 ( evans et al .",
    "but very recently , gallenne et al.(2013 ) , using the chara array , reported that they have resolved a very close companion in observations made at two epochs in 2012 .",
    "the measured separations were @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "these observations indicate that the b star seen by _ iue _ is the 1938-day companion , but this leaves the occasional reports of a more distant visually resolved companion unexplained .",
    "having assembled the complete sample of 18 cepheids brighter than @xmath19 that have binary companions more massive than @xmath8 , we will now investigate the orbital separations in these systems . in col .",
    "5 of table  1 , we indicate whether the systems have a spectroscopic rv orbit with a known period ( o ) , have been spatially resolved ( r ) , or have an unknown orbital period but detected orbital motion ( om ) .      of the 18 systems listed in table  1",
    ", nine have known orbital periods based on rv studies . for these binaries ,",
    "the orbital periods are listed in col .",
    "6 of table  1 , and are taken from evans et al .",
    "( 2005 ) or evans et al .",
    "( 2011b ) .",
    "the logarithms of the orbital periods are given in col .",
    "7 , and the logarithms of the orbital separations in col .  8 .",
    "these objects tend of course to be the more compact binary systems .",
    "we have recently completed a snapshot imaging survey of 69 nearby cepheids with the _ hst _ wfc3 camera ( program i d number go-12215 ) .",
    "full details of the survey , in particular point - spread function ( psf ) subtraction to search for resolved low - mass companions of the cepheids , will be presented in a later paper .",
    "however , some of the results are relevant to the present study of more massive cepheid companions .",
    "the wfc3 images were obtained in the medium - width f621 m and f845 m filters , hereafter referred to as `` @xmath20 '' and `` @xmath21 . ''",
    "all 18 stars listed in table  1 were imaged in the course of the snapshot survey . for three of the targets@xmath4  aql , v659  cen , and",
    "s  nor  the intermediate - mass companion stars were resolved .",
    "figure  1 depicts the @xmath20-band images of these three systems , and table  2 gives details of the observations and measurements .",
    "the companions are plainly visible although the psf is complicated and even these relatively bright companions are significantly fainter than the cepheid .",
    "we did not attempt to measure the brightnesses of these companions in these images , since the _ iue _ spectra provide information about the temperature and brightness of the companions .",
    "however , we have measured the separation from the cepheid directly on the @xmath21-band images , which is listed in table  2 .",
    "these are , of course , only the instantaneous projected separations ; however we will be examining the distribution of the logarithm of separations , so this is a small uncertainty .    for completeness , we also include in table  2 the wider resolved @xmath9  cep system , and the close w  sgr , both of which were discussed in  2 .",
    "( the companion of @xmath9  cep was outside our wfc3 field of view , and the companion of w  sgr was within the saturated pixels close to the cepheid . )    for @xmath4 aql , benedict et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found perturbations in their _ hst _ fgs measurements within a couple of years , implying a companion in a relatively short - period orbit .",
    "since we have now directly resolved the hottest companion in the system ( table  2 ) with a much larger separation / period , we conclude that the system is triple .",
    "the cepheid s  nor is a member of a cluster , increasing the probability of a chance optical alignment .",
    "however , the small separation ( @xmath22 ) makes a physical association highly probable .",
    "s  nor also has a hot companion at a much wider separation of @xmath23 ( evans & udalski 1994 ) , making it a possible triple . in this case , given the high stellar density in the cluster , this could be a chance alignment .",
    "we used the angular separations in table  2 , along with the secondary masses from table  1 , and the primary masses and distances from table  3 ( below ) , to calculate nominal orbital periods , by equating the projected angular separation to the semimajor axis , @xmath24 , of the putative orbit .",
    "the resulting @xmath25 values are given in col .",
    "7 of table 1 . to distinguish these from the directly determined spectroscopic periods (  3.1 ) ,",
    "the @xmath25 values are given to only one decimal place .",
    "col .  8 of table  1 gives the values of @xmath26 , again to only one decimal .",
    "of the 18 systems in table  1 , nine have known orbital periods , and five have been spatially resolved , as recounted above .",
    "the remaining four stars ( su  cas , bp  cir , t  mon , and t  vul ) have detected hot companions whose temperatures and luminosities are consistent with the distances of the cepheids ( evans 1992b ; evans 1992c ; evans 1994 ; evans et al .  1999 ) .",
    "while a chance alignment between a b or a star and a cepheid is highly improbable , orbital motion would be conclusive proof of physical association . in this subsection",
    "we discuss what is known from rvs in the literature , and what limits can be put on the separations .",
    "( 1 )  _ su cas _",
    ": rvs have been measured in a number of studies .",
    "the best claim for the detection of orbital motion is by gorynya , rastorguev , & samus ( 1996 ) , who rate su  cas as a possible spectroscopic binary .",
    "we have tested this by comparing two seasons of accurate data from the same group ( moscow university ) so that instrumental differences should be minimal .",
    "typical uncertainties of their annual velocities are @xmath27@xmath28 .",
    "we have chosen data from two years ( 1995 and 1997 ) which are predicted to have orbital velocities close to minimum and maximum according to their proposed orbit , and a velocity difference of @xmath29 .",
    "when the pulsation velocity curves from the two years are overlaid , there is no appreciable difference , certainly nothing as large as that predicted by the orbit .",
    "we conclude that orbital motion has _ not _ been detected convincingly .",
    "( 2 )  _ bp cir _ : rv data have been discussed by petterson et al .  ( 2004 ) .",
    "the original velocity data are from balona ( 1981 ) , and have standard deviations of @xmath30 ( stobie & balona 1979 ) .",
    "data were added from the mount john university observatory , with the final three years providing an accuracy of @xmath27@xmath31 .",
    "petterson et al .",
    "estimate the orbital motion to be greater than @xmath32 .",
    "orbital motion appears to be seen on timescales of decades , providing some constraint on the period , but further observations are needed for confirmation .",
    "( 3 )  _ t mon _ : rv variation is seen , although the orbital period is too long for a determination at present .",
    "preliminary estimates of the period are between 90 and 260 years ( evans et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "( 4 )  _ t vul _ : it has been suggested several times that orbital motion may have been detected in rv measurements .",
    "bersier et al .",
    "( 1994 ) discuss this on the basis of 11 years of coravel data .",
    "they find a standard deviation of the data around the pulsation fourier curve of only @xmath33 .",
    "there are some limitations in the spacing of the data , in that the coravel observations were made only in the autumn and the most likely suggested period is close to 2  years .",
    "however , there is no evidence of orbital motion at the level of @xmath34@xmath35 .",
    "kiss ( 1998 ) and kiss & vinko ( 2000 ) extended the data series to 20 years using rvs from david dunlap observatory spectra .",
    "3 in kiss & vinko shows no indication of orbital motion , only a possible small difference in the shape of the curve from the analytic fit to the coravel data .",
    "we conclude that the highest - quality data show no orbital motion .      while these four stars do not have a period or separation as well defined as either the stars with rv orbits or the resolved stars , there is information on both these quantities which provides significant constraints .",
    "for the two stars with orbital motion , bp  cir and t  mon , we can assign reasonable estimates of the periods from the discussion in the previous section which should not result in large errors in the distribution of @xmath25 for the entire sample . for bp  cir , an orbital period of 20 years ( @xmath36 in days )",
    "is plausible for the observed orbital motion . for t",
    "mon , a period of @xmath0150  years ( @xmath37 in days ) is in the middle of the range of plausible orbital periods .    the remaining two stars ",
    "su cas and t vul  appear to lie in the orbital separation range between the stars with known orbital periods and those for which the companions are separated widely enough to be resolved with _ hst _ or from the ground .",
    "neither star was resolved in our wfc3 survey .",
    "we estimate that these comparatively bright companions would have been resolved for a separation of more than @xmath38 . using the distances to the two stars , as well as the masses ( tables 1 and 3 ) , this results in upper limits to @xmath25 of 5.2 for su  cas and 5.5 for t  vul . for lower limits to the separation , we use rv observations .",
    "as discussed above for su cas , orbital motion was not seen in recent rv data ( gorynya et al .",
    "there are also earlier high - quality rv data . based in particular on the discussion of niva & schmidt ( 1979 )",
    "we conclude that no orbital motion has been detected over 40 years , and use that as an orbital period lower limit ( @xmath39 in days ) .",
    "thus the available data constrain the periods for both stars to lie between @xmath40 and 3 @xmath41 @xmath42  days . in table  1",
    "we assign su  cas to @xmath43 and t  vul to @xmath44 .",
    "the next parameter of the sample to examine is the mass ratio @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the mass of the secondary companion and @xmath47 is the mass of the cepheid .",
    "one of the strengths of the present study is that the masses of _ both _ the primary and the secondary can be inferred from uncontaminated spectra and photometry of both stars in the visible and the uv , respectively .",
    "furthermore , this direct access to the parameters of both components is available at _ all _ orbital separations , which is unique among samples of massive stars .",

    "one parameter that is similar between 5 and @xmath67 stars is the binary frequency .",
    "the binary frequencies for periods longer than a year and @xmath65 are 24% for cepheids and 27% for solar - mass stars .",
    "the mass ratios , @xmath59 , in table  1 have been computed directly from _ uncontaminated _ information about both components .",
    "the mass ratio of bp  cir has the unphysical result that it is slightly larger than 1.0 ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "we take this simply to indicate an uncertainty in the derivation of the masses , and that the mass of the cepheid is only very slightly larger than that of the companion .",
    "8 shows the frequency distribution of @xmath59 .",
    "although the sample is modest in size , it is well defined .",
    "the @xmath730.4 bin is presumably somewhat incomplete , since the sample criterion was based on the mass of the secondary , and the resulting @xmath59 depends also on the mass of the primary .",
    "the highest frequency is for systems in the smallest two bins ( @xmath740.5 ) .",
    "one interpretation of the cepheid distribution would be a bimodal one , with a concentration at large @xmath59 ( equal masses ) and another one around @xmath75 , with fewer systems in between .",
    "does the distribution of mass ratios depend on the separations of the systems ?",
    "8 compares the total sample with the sample of closer systems ( @xmath76 ; scaled by a factor of 2 ) .",
    "the largest change is in the smaller-@xmath59 bins .",
    "that is , there is an indication that closer systems are more likely to have larger @xmath59 than wider systems ( remembering that the cepheid sample is limited to systems of a year or longer , i.e. , @xmath77 . )",
    "cepheids ( evans et al .",
    "2005 ) and also solar - mass stars ( raghavan et al .",
    "2010 ) have a high proportion of triple systems among the multiple systems .",
    "the sample discussed here is a particularly good one for examining the effects of triple systems , since information is available about each secondary mass and frequently the velocity of the secondary , which increases the probability of identifying triple systems",
    "10 and 11 in table  1 indicate which of the cepheid sample are known to be triple systems , and the source of this information .",
    "( v1334  cyg is not classified as a triple as discussed above .",

    "9 shows the distribution of mass ratios for the known members of triple systems compared with the full sample .",
    "the large-@xmath59 systems do _ not _ appear in the sample of triples .",
    "that is , there is an indication that in a triple system , the mass ratio between the most massive and the second most massive star in the system is not as large as in a simple binary system , presumably frequently somewhat compensated for by the mass of the third star in the system .    the comparison between the cumulative distributions is shown in fig .",
    "10 . as in figs .  8 and 9 ,",
    "differences are suggestive but not statistically significant in a k - s test .",
    "how does the distribution of mass ratios for our cepheids compare with those for other stellar classes ?",
    "sana & evans ( 2011 ) find that for their o - star sample , a uniform distribution in @xmath59 fits the data well .",
    "this is shown in fig .  11 ,",
    "compared with the distribution for the cepheid sample .",
    "the normalization is approximate because the cepheid study does not include small-@xmath59 systems . for solar - mass stars ,",
    "duquennoy & mayor ( 1991 ) concluded that the @xmath59 distribution is very similar to the initial mass function ( imf ) , with few systems near @xmath78 and many with small @xmath59 .",
    "the recent , updated sample by raghavan et al .  ( 2010 ) came to different conclusions .",
    "11 also shows the distribution of @xmath59 values for the raghavan et al .",
    "sample of solar - mass stars . for the comparison we have used data from their fig .",
    "16 ( left ) binary systems .",
    "their study illustrates very well the complexity presented by components from the combination of binary and multiple systems .",
    "they have looked at the @xmath59 distribution for binary and multiple systems divided in two ways ( within a spectroscopic binary and also the ratio of the combined spectroscopic binary mass to the mass of the visual binary secondary ) .",
    "the first approach ( their fig .",
    "16b ) gives a distribution very similar to that of their binary systems .",
    "we do not have information comparable to the second approach ( their fig .",
    "therefore we have adopted their distribution for binary systems as representative of their findings .",
    "we have rebinned it into bins covering 0.1 in @xmath59 and approximately scaled it ( fig .",
    "this treatment of the data decreases the prominence of the peak at equal masses ( @xmath79 ) for the solar - mass stars , which makes the distribution reasonably similar to the uniform distribution for the o stars .",
    "the largest peak in the cepheid data is at the smallest @xmath59 values in our sample .",
    "further discussion of the distribution of @xmath59 values is deferred to a later paper in this series , which will deal with a larger range of mass ratios .",
    "an important parameter to investigate further with this sample is whether there is any difference in binary / multiple characteristics between close and wide systems .",
    "figs .  12 and 13 explore further the comparison made in fig .  8 . fig .",
    "12 shows the distributions of mass ratios for stars with @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the suggestion that closer systems have larger mass ratios is confirmed in fig .",
    "13 , which compares the cumulative distributions for these two period groups .",
    "an important question in interpreting the distributions in figs .",
    "12 and 13 is whether they trace back to the original formation state , or whether there has been any dynamical evolution in the periods and separations of the systems after formation .",
    "one approach to this problem is to compare the properties of binary and triple systems .",
    "systems with three ( or more ) components can have interactions between the stars which will alter the original configuration ( even sometimes ejecting a component ) , which does not happen in purely binary systems .",
    "as discussed above , we have identified a number of triple systems within the sample .",
    "14 compares the distribution of mass ratio and @xmath25 for binary and triple systems . as noted above",
    ", the binary systems have higher @xmath59 on average . using the binary sample as `` dynamically unevolved , '' fig .",
    "14 shows that it contains wide systems as well as close ones , similar to the triple systems .",
    "that is , the indication is that the wide systems are not exclusively those with a component moved out by dynamical interaction .",
    "there are two caveats to this first exploration .",
    "some of the binaries may have undetected third components ( despite the extensive multi - wavelength information on the sample ) . however , the binary sample should be dominated by systems which have not had internal interactions between components .",
    "second , of course , it is possible that a previous component has been ejected , but this could have happened in either the binary or triple sample .",
    "we have used an _ iue _ survey of cepheids to create a list of binary systems with mass ratios @xmath82 , which is complete for all separations . we have combined separations from resolved companions from an _ hst _ imaging survey with orbits from the literature and rv data to derive the distribution of orbital separations for the sample .",
    "the @xmath1 cepheids are found to have systematically shorter orbital periods than the sample of @xmath83 stars from raghavan et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , confirmed as statistically significant by a k - s test ( fig .",
    "the distribution of mass ratios is also presented , with suggestions that closer systems have larger mass ratios and also that triple systems have smaller secondary to primary mass ratios . the distribution of mass ratios as a function of orbital separation , however , is the same whether a system is a binary or a triple .",
    "these results for @xmath1 for all separations and mass ratios @xmath84 is the first step to be followed by studies of resolved companions , low - mass companions ( of late b stars ) , and radial - velocity observations .",
    "the picture that is thus built up of binary properties will be compared with those of higher and lower mass stars for insights into star formation as well as future evolution .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank h. harris and k. kratter for valuable discussions .",
