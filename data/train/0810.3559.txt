    "the two - dimensional homogeneous electron gas is one of the fundamental models in condensed matter physics . despite its simplicity  the system consists of electrons interacting through a @xmath3-potential to which a uniform positive background is added for charge neutrality  the phase diagram at zero temperature is nontrivial@xcite . in general , it is given in terms of the dimensionless parameter @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the electronic density and @xmath6 the bohr radius ( see section [ notations ] for notations and units ) . at low density ( large @xmath0 ) , the potential energy dominates over the kinetic energy and the system forms a triangular lattice , the wigner crystal ( wc ) , whereas in the high density region ( @xmath7 ) the kinetic energy favors a uniform fermi gas ( fg ) phase@xcite ( the simplest state given as the determinant of the plane waves with wave vector @xmath8 of modulus smaller than @xmath9 ) .",
    "the energy of the fg is known analytically .",
    "already wigner@xcite argued that the unpolarized fg is unstable even in the limit @xmath7 .",
    "later , overhauser claimed the instability of the unpolarized wc with respect to spin - density waves , even within the hartree - fock approximation ( hf)@xcite .",
    "it has further been conjectured that the coulomb potential prevents any first order transition between the wc and a fg@xcite . despite these rather general instability theorems ,",
    "there are few quantitative calculations of the true ground state of the electron gas within hf@xcite .",
    "a previous hf study @xcite of the two and three dimensional electron gas compares the fg energy with the energy of various states with imposed crystal symmetries . for the polarized two - dimensional gas ,",
    "they find lower energies for a crystal for @xmath0 larger than @xmath10 .",
    "only recently an unrestricted hf study of the unpolarized three - dimensional electron gas was performed which proposes a more complicated structure of a ground state with spin - density waves in the high density region@xcite .    indeed , establishing the precise hf phase diagram of the electron gas influences the correlation energy estimations , since by definition the many - body correlation effects",

    "the search of the true ground state of the quantum many - body system is reduced to the simpler problem of finding the lowest energy states in the subset of the slater determinants ( see eq .",

    "we refer to this solution as the metallic phase . however , as @xmath0 approaches zero , the energy gain of this metallic crystal compared to the fg gets more and more tiny . at the same time , @xmath38 is either constant or increases when @xmath0 decreases ( apart for a few exceptions ) . at @xmath42 ,",

    "now we would like to understand the nature of the slater determinants in the metallic phase .",
    "a slater determinant is obtained as a set of @xmath12 orthonormal single particle wavefunctions @xmath51 .",
    "only the space generated by the @xmath51 s is relevant , and in order to understand the numerical results we need to choose a canonical representation of the @xmath51 s .",

    ", the space generated by the @xmath54 s becomes close to the space generated by the @xmath55 s .",
    "let @xmath56 be the square matrix defined by @xmath57 which measures the overlap of the two slater determinants .",
    "the singular value decomposition ( svd ) of @xmath56 is @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath15 are unitary matrices and @xmath60 is a diagonal positive matrix .",
    "then the orthonormal set @xmath61 defined by : @xmath62 is a basis of @xmath63 close to the basis @xmath52 of @xmath64 in the sense that @xmath65 as soon as @xmath66 s is close to one .    from now on",
    ", we assume that the single particle wavefunctions , @xmath51 , have been chosen in this way .",
    "thus if @xmath0 is not too large , @xmath51 is close to @xmath67 ( at least for @xmath68 associated to a wave vector not too close to the fermi surface ) that is @xmath69 is close to one .",
    "thus , the largest amplitude of @xmath70 is for @xmath71 , and fig.[b499 ] represents the next largest amplitude of @xmath51 , that we denote @xmath72 , for 499 electrons at @xmath73 in 2d .     for 499 electrons in two dimensions at @xmath74 .",
    ", scaledwidth=40.0% ]    for @xmath75 , @xmath51 has essentially only two nonzero components : one at @xmath71 and the other one @xmath76 at the vector @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the vector of the six - fold star of figure [ fig - chargedensities ] ( d ) such that @xmath8 is close to the fermi surface .",
    "this condition can only be satisfied for a set of @xmath53 closed to a six - fold star as we see on figure [ b499 ] .",
    "one can understand why metallic states should exist at small @xmath0 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "let us replace a plane wave state @xmath8 of the fg ( @xmath79 ) by a superposition of two plane waves with wavevectors @xmath8 and @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "choosing @xmath82 on the six - fold star of a triangular lattice we certainly obtain a gain in potential energy .",
    "the increase of kinetic energy is minimized if @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "then , the number of solutions for @xmath8 is optimal if @xmath85 .",
    "this solution corresponds to a triangular lattice of length @xmath86 in real space leading to a unit cell of volume @xmath87 .",
    "since the system is contained in the volume @xmath88 , we will obtain @xmath89 lattice sites , or @xmath90 where we have used @xmath91 .",
    "we will elaborate this argument into an analytical proof of an upper bound on the ground state energy in section [ bounds ] .",
    "in this section we provide some details about the descent method used to obtain numerically the hf ground states of the electron gas .",
    "the variation of the total energy @xmath92 with respect to a variation of the single particle state @xmath93 is given by @xmath94 where @xmath95 , the so - called hf hamiltonian , is a single particle operator depending on the full state @xmath96 ( not on the particular choice of the @xmath51 s ) .",
    "extremal states must satisfy the following equation @xmath97 where @xmath98 are the lagrange coefficients associated with the normalization constraint @xmath99 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath100 is not an extremum , we have @xmath101 where the @xmath102 s satisfy @xmath103 , @xmath104 . within the steepest descent method one chooses first a @xmath105 unitary transformation @xmath106 such that one obtains @xmath107 for the transformed single particle states @xmath108 , @xmath109 .",
    "the energy @xmath110 can be expressed as a sum of rational fractions whose numerators and denominators are polynomials of order four , at most .",
    "thus , it is possible to find the best @xmath111 and to iterate the process until a stationary state is reached .",
    "in fact , this method has the same drawbacks as the steepest decent method in linear optimization problems ; in general , it converges slowly . for linear problems ,",
    "conjugate gradient methods are preferable @xcite . however , since the hf states do not form a linear space , the genuine conjugate gradient method does not apply here .",
    "we have therefore adapted a variant of this method to the non - linear case .",
    "let @xmath112 be the previous variation @xmath93 , and @xmath102 is obtained by eq.([eqh1 ] ) .",
    "we then compute @xmath113 for six values of the pairs @xmath114 in order to approximate @xmath115 by a polynomial of order two in @xmath111 and @xmath116 . minimizing the polynomial with respect to @xmath111 and @xmath116",
    ", we obtain the new changes of the single particle states , @xmath93 , and the corresponding energy change .",
    "this process is iterated until the relative variation of the energy , @xmath117 , is sufficiently small .",
    "we compute the wavefunction on a @xmath118 grid , the fast fourier transform is used to switch between real and reciprocal space@xcite .",
    "we have systematically checked the convergence of the solution with respect to the grid size . for the fg ground state",
    ", convergence is reached once all @xmath25-vectors up to @xmath119 are represented in the grid ( @xmath120 ) . at larger @xmath0 , in the wc phase ,",
    "the wave functions are essentially gaussians@xcite .",
    "the width @xmath121 of the gaussians scales as @xmath122 . for a correct resolution of the gaussians we need @xmath123 , so that the number of grid points increases at low densities , @xmath124 .",
    "convergence is reached for @xmath125 ( resp .",
    "64 , 128 ) for @xmath126 ( resp .",
    "@xmath127 , @xmath128 ) up to @xmath21 . whenever the number of grid points is chosen too small , solutions without any particular symmetries are obtained .",
    "we have further studied the influence of the initial state on the final solution , by choosing different types of wavefunction for initialization : a wc state , a converged state stored at larger or lower @xmath0 , a state initialized with random numbers , or a `` metallic state '' as described above .    typically , the energies decrease exponentially with the number of iterations .",
    "the decrease in energy during transitions to a different symmetry is in general much smaller than the convergence within the same symmetry .",
    "we have often seen energy plateaus with changes of relative energy @xmath129 just before the occurrence of a transition to a completely different state . for system",
    "sizes up to @xmath130 , the minimization is continued until a relative precision of @xmath131 is reached , and for larger @xmath12 a relative precision of @xmath132 is used .",
    "in this section we set our notations and recall the basic formulas of the electron gas .",
    "we consider the hamiltonian of @xmath12 electrons in a 2d or 3d square box of volume @xmath133 with periodic boundary conditions : @xmath134 where @xmath15 is the 2-body coulomb potential @xmath135 , the electron mass is @xmath50 , and @xmath136 is its charge .",
    "it is convenient to choose hartree as the unit of energy , @xmath137 .",
    "we get : @xmath138 let @xmath139 be an orthonormalized set of @xmath12 vectors of @xmath140 .",
