    "a variety of random , or disordered systems are known to have non - trivial universalities .",
    "these include the universality consisting of the well - known three symmetry classes which appear in the weak localization effects to the conductance @xcite or the level correlations @xcite in disordered electronic systems , and the universality in the wave function multifractality at the integer quantum hall transition in which disorder plays an essential role @xcite ; even the universality in the distribution of the zeros of the riemann zeta function is expected to have its origin in some chaotic system @xcite , and it may possibly be closely related to some disordered system .",
    "it is amazing that some of these systems in appropriate limits are phenomenologically well described by such simple ansatz as the one in the random matrix theory .",
    "it is , however , by no means certain that these phenomena are well understood theoretically .",
    "the most fundamental problem to be understood is how the universalities in disordered systems emerge from a microscopic structure of each system .",
    "a lot of effort has been made to investigate this direction , and in some cases we have a partial answer ; we can first formulate a system microscopically , then by using a very crude approximation ( such as ` dimensional reduction ' used in disordered electronic systems @xcite ) , deduce universality directly in some carefully chosen limit . even under such fortunate circumstances",
    ", it is usually the case that we do not have much knowledge on the way along which the system deviates from the universality away from the limit .",
    "this is , roughly speaking , because a disordered system formulated on a microscopic ground typically has highly nonlinear interactions induced by disorder and becomes almost intractable without any crude approximations .",
    "thus , it is important to study a simple model which is tractable with a sensible approximation ; analysis of such a model and ideas used there may lead to a practical way to obtain qualitative results on the deviation from the universality in more complicated disordered systems and to an insight on the emergence of the universality itself .    with this broad motivation in mind , among the diverse disordered systems ,",
    "we take a problem in statistical physics , where relations between microscopic properties and macroscopic behavior of models are often quite intelligible . more specifically ,",
    "we study a model with quenched disorder defined on a lattice focusing on its possible critical behavior .",
    "understanding the behavior of such a system governed by the hamiltonian which contains quenched inhomogeneous interactions is especially important , both from the practical perspective that there are no translationally invariant perfect crystals in the real systems and from theoretical interests inspired by the other disorder - induced phenomena .",
    "as is well known , the solid notion of the universality class has been established in the field of critical phenomena without disorder .",
    "nonlinear interactions inherent in a model are essential to understand the existence of the non - trivial universality classes @xcite ; one should confront with the nonlinearities in a more powerful framework than the mean field approximation .",
    "the ideas of scaling and renormalization group ( rg ) give such a framework .",
    "in this framework , one introduces a theory space and a vector field on it , which generates a flow that indicates the scale dependence of a theory considered . assuming critical points in the second order phase transitions",
    "are described by scale invariant field theories , they correspond to the fixed points of the flow .",
    "the flow can be determined , step by step , by a path integration on the fluctuations belonging to a certain scale ; the nonlinear interactions induce the mutual coupling among degrees of freedom at different scales . as a result ,",
    "the global configuration of the flow can become non - trivial .",
    "then we can read off the universality classes from the sets of rg eigenvalues which characterize the flow linearized around the fixed points .",
    "furthermore , it is known that the ideas of rg are not only powerful to resolve the universality classes in the critical phenomena of pure systems but also flexible enough to deal with some disordered systems .    for the target of this paper , a system governed by an inhomogeneous hamiltonian , it is natural to consider a configuration of the interactions as one realization from an ensemble that respects given probability distribution .",
    "basic observables to be discussed can be related to the free energy in a large enough system , which is expected to be self - averaging over the disorder distribution .",
    "we should therefore study the quenched average : the average over the disorder distribution , of the free energy obtained by tracing over the statistical mechanical degrees of freedom .    actually , evaluating the quenched average of the free energy is notoriously difficult task , since we should evaluate the average of the logarithm of the partition function in a non - translational invariant realization of the disorder .",
    "it is practical to use either one of the two methods : replica @xcite or supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "when these methods are applicable , we are left with an effective theory with the translational invariance , but this time , with the additional nonlinear interactions induced by the disorder .",
    "it should be noted that the system acquires enhanced symmetry , namely , the replica permutation symmetry or the supergroup symmetry , respectively .    for a weakly disordered system , one can consider the disorder - induced couplings in the effective theory as a perturbation to the corresponding pure theory .",
    "a natural question is whether the induced coupling destructs the critical phenomena of pure system , or not . a basic and general result on this direction",
    "is known as the ",
    "harris criterion \" that tells when the disorder can be neglected at large scales ; if the couplings are irrelevant in the rg sense , the disorder can not change the universality class of the system from that of the pure system @xcite .",
    "however when they are relevant or marginal , one should work harder to analyze the flow , namely , proceed to calculation of loop diagrams formed by the disorder - induced couplings .",
    "this procedure corresponds to the calculation of the rg beta function up to the second or higher order in the couping . in the case",
    "that the beta function has a zero in addition to the one corresponding to the pure fixed point , the flow can ( depending on the sign of the beta function ) transfer , at large scale , the theory to another fixed point ; one recognizes that the disordered system belongs to a non - trivial universality class .",
    "the rg eigenvalues belonging to the universality class can be predicted perturbatively . in general , without a special reason to be integrable , one can not solve given interacting statistical model .",
    "therefore , the importance of such a crossover from one fixed point to the other can not be overemphasized .",
    "we shall study a one - parameter family of disordered models and discuss their universality class in two dimensions .",
    "thus , let us briefly note the special role of two dimensions in the study of the universality class of pure systems first , and then comment on the current status of corresponding study in disordered systems .",
    "working in two dimensions provides us with an ideal circumstance to study the crossover in depth .",
    "first , in two dimensions the conformal symmetry is infinite dimensional , and assuming the conformal symmetry ( instead of the scale invariance only ) enables us to classify the possible fixed points of unitary theories with minimal symmetry @xcite .",
    "second , it can be shown that the rg flow is irreversible for unitary theories (  @xmath10-theorem \" ) @xcite .",
    "third , there are known examples of the crossover in which , at the non - trivial fixed point reachable via the flow from other fixed points , the realized enhanced - symmetries are known and the non - perturbative results can be obtained @xcite .    in the disordered systems in two dimensions , on the other hand , fixed points created by disorder are expected to be described by cft s , but by more general , non - unitary ones .",
    "the lack of the unitarity gives rise to the challenging problems of determining the universality class in disordered systems .",
    "major current examples concerned with the restrictive cases where the supersymmetry method can be used .",
    "they typically lead to logarithmic cft s where the disorder - induced coupling is marginally irrelevant @xcite . in these cases",
    ", the coupling goes to zero under the rg flow , and the models do not cause any non - trivial crossover .",
    "there is also a consideration on the running of the effective central charge defined on the basis of the supersymmetry @xcite , in analogy with the @xmath10-theorem in pure ( unitary ) systems @xcite . at present , however , not much is known about the crossover cases , and hence our understanding of the disordered critical points is quite limited .",
    "one of a few exceptional examples showing the crossover is the random - bond @xmath9-state potts model in two dimension @xcite .",
    "the model at @xmath11 is the random - bond ising model and does not show the crossover ; it is equivalent to the random - mass fermion model , or using the replica method , to the multi - color gross - neveu model , in all of which the interaction is marginally irrelevant @xcite . now in the @xmath12-invariant scalar field theory ( without disorder ) , a nontrivial fixed point emerges when the dimension @xmath13 is considered as a continuous parameter in the range @xmath14 @xcite . in the random - bond @xmath9-state potts model , it is also fundamental to consider the parameter @xmath9 as a continuous number .",
    "one has then a non - trivial fixed point in the region @xmath15 .",
    "the perturbative calculation of the rg eigenvalues belonging to this non - trivial universality class is well under control . in particular ,",
    "the theoretical prediction for the exponent of spin - spin correlation function is in good agreement with the numerical simulation @xcite .    in this paper , we introduce the disordered version of the @xmath0 model model is another natural extension of the ising model other than the @xmath9-state potts model . ] and study the crossover in it .",
    "our model has its own physical importance at certain integral values of @xmath5 ; it corresponds to the random - bond xy @xmath16 , the random - bond ising @xmath17 and the polymers ( or , self - avoiding walks ) in random environment @xmath18 . but more importantly",
    ", we consider the models for continuous values of @xmath5 ; this leads to another example of the crossover in disordered system .    for continuous values of @xmath5 ,",
    "as explained below , we have a family of models which describe fluctuating loops in a two dimensional random background .",
    "as is well known , elementary excitations in a spin system like the @xmath0 model can be considered as non - local geometrical objects , namely , loops in the high - temperature expansion .",
    "it has been repeatedly emphasized that these loops are analogous to the closed trajectories of some particles @xcite . now",
    "the parameter @xmath5 controls a statistics of particles in the random potential ; we expect distinct , non - trivial behavior according to the value of @xmath5 . in order to study these",
    ", we use the replica method as in the studies of the random - bond potts model @xcite ; the method leads us to consider several , say @xmath2 , layers of two dimensional @xmath0 models coupled each other via the disorder - induced coupling , and to take the @xmath1 limit in the end .",
    "the loops in the pure @xmath0 model become scale invariant at critical temperature for @xmath19 . we investigate critical behavior in the disordered @xmath0 model using conformal perturbation theory around the one - parameter family of cft s corresponding to a line of the pure @xmath0 critical points @xcite .",
    "the existence of the crossover in our model suggests that there is a one - parameter family of non - unitary cft s . in this respect ,",
    "we mention recent development of the stochastic loewner evolution ( sle ) @xcite , and its application to non - unitary critical points @xcite .",
    "the line of the fixed points in our model may serves as a natural target of such study in disordered system .",
    "the organization of the paper is the following . in section 2 , we formulate the model on a lattice , and explain the types of the quenched disorder considered .",
    "then we use the replica method and take the disorder average . as a result , we reach an intriguing picture of particles going up and down across the two dimensional layers , thus forming a whole connected diagrams . then we discuss the relation between the observable on a lattice and the scaling fields in a continuum limit .",
    "we see that the nontrivial cases in which the disorder is relevant occur for @xmath20 . in section 3 , we perform one loop calculation and discuss the existence of a non - trivial fixed point . one loop beta function suggests the existence of a threshold @xmath21 ; the fixed point exists for @xmath22 , while the strongly coupled phase exists in @xmath23 . in section 4",
    ", we perform the two loop calculation for @xmath22 , using the full information of the four - point function provided by the @xmath0 cft . the next - leading order correction for the thermal exponent and the lowest order correction for the spin exponent",
    "are then found . in section 5",
    ", we calculate the effective central charge defined in the replica formalism .",
    "we find that this increases , along the flow , against the c - theorem which is responsible for unitary theories .",
    "we conclude in section 6 , and comment on few further directions .",
    "appendix a provides the formulas on the critical liouville field theory used in the paper . in appendices b and c ,",
    "we describe the calculation of the integral in two loop calculation of the beta function and in the spin scaling dimensions , respectively .",
    "finally , appendix d is devoted to the derivation of the integral formula and the expansion techniques .",
    "the main formula takes the form of the scattering amplitude reflecting the picture that the particle forming the loop can propagate via intermediate states while going across the replica layers .",
    "in this section , we formulate disordered @xmath0 loop models on a lattice and discuss their continuum limit . in section [ lattice ] ,",
    "three types of the disordered lattice models are mapped to homogeneous coupled lattice models by the replica method .",
    "we introduce known cft for the homogeneous @xmath0 model and discuss the relation between lattice and continuum in section [ homogeneous ] . in section [ scalingdisordered ] , the effective action for the continuum disordered model is derived making use of the operator product expansion ( ope ) .",
    "we start with the partition function of pure @xmath0 model on a two - dimensional lattice : z(t , n ) = _ i ( s_i ) d^ns_i  _ ",
    "< i , j > ( 1+t s_is_j ) , [ ztn ] where @xmath24 is a @xmath5-component spin on a site @xmath25 , and @xmath26 represents a measure on the isotropic internal space ; using the notation @xmath27 for the tracing operation @xmath28 , it satisfies @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the interaction is short - ranged , and the notation @xmath32 refers to a link between the nearest - neighbor sites of the lattice .",
    "a basic idea in this paper is to continue the parameter @xmath5 to non - integral values and to take advantage of known continuum properties of the corresponding @xmath0 model @xcite . on a lattice ,",
    "the partition function ( [ ztn ] ) of the spin system with an arbitrary value of @xmath5 can be interpreted as a model for fluctuating loops .",
    "it becomes especially simple on a honeycomb lattice , and then tracing over the spin degrees of freedom yields , z(t , n)= _ t^ n^ , [ tn ] where the summation is taken over the configuration of the closed loops @xcite .",
    "now the weight per bond of loops is @xmath33 , while the weight per closed loop is @xmath5 , which is called a fugacity and can take non - integral values .",
    "the model in ( [ ztn ] ) shows universal critical behavior when @xmath34 , and we may use the same continuum description regardless of specific lattice structures .    another interpretation to make sense out of the non - integral values of @xmath5 is possible for @xmath35 . by orienting the loops , one can assign a complex boltzmann weight @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) to each clockwise ( anti - clockwise ) loop with a phase angle @xmath38 determined from the relation @xmath39 .",
    "this notion of the oriented loops here is standard in the coulomb gas ( cg ) methods @xcite , where the loops are mapped to the level lines of a height model @xcite .",
    "one can also consider the loop as a closed trajectory of some particle .",
    "the local phase factor @xmath40 is then associated , at a site , with each turn of the particle through an angle @xmath41 .",
    "this is a lattice version of the spin factor discussed in @xcite . in a sense ,",
    "the value of @xmath5 controls statistics of the particles .",
    "the qualitative behavior of the @xmath0 model can be summarized as follows .",
    "when @xmath35 , the model has three different phases separated by a critical point @xmath42 . ] .",
    "the region @xmath43 corresponds to the high temperature phase of the spin model , and the length of loop measured by the unit of the lattice spacing is finite . on the other hand ,",
    "the average length of the loop is divergent either at @xmath42 or in @xmath44 . the @xmath0 model at the critical point @xmath42",
    "is called in the  dilute \" phase , since the fraction of the number of sites visited by some loop is zero . in @xmath44 ,",
    "this fraction becomes non - zero and the corresponding phase is called  low temperature \" or ",
    "dense \" phase .",
    "it is known that the shapes of the loops in the dilute and the dense phase are described by the @xmath45 with the brownian motion amplitude @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively @xcite .",
    "we now give the partition function of the random model as z= _",
    "s_i  _  < i , j > ( 1+t_ijs_is_j ) , [ ztn_dis ] where the local interactions @xmath48 between spins are position dependent and the notation @xmath49 refers to some definite configuration of the interaction .",
    "we consider the configuration @xmath49 as a realization taken from some ensemble with a probability distribution functional @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "one might assume a non - local probability distribution functional , but here we restrict ourselves to study the case of short range correlation .",
    "this means that the interaction @xmath51 on each link independently respects single distribution function @xmath52 .",
    "later , we shall let @xmath52 a gaussian - like distribution .",
    "given an inhomogeneous realization @xmath53 , the tracing over the spin degrees of freedom is still possible : z(\\{t},n)=_n^_l=1^ t_a_l(1 ) a_l(2)t_a_l(2 )",
    "a_l(3)t_a_l(l_l ) a_l(1 ) , [ ntt ] where @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) denotes a site which belongs to the @xmath56-th loop of a length @xmath57 .",
    "now the path of the particles forming loops should avoid the links with higher cost ; we expect its behavior to change , according to the value of @xmath5 .",
    "the situation is , to some extent , analogous to the problem of the electrons in a random potential which has been studied in connection with the anderson localization @xcite . as the weight @xmath33 is different from link to link ( figure [ figurelattice]-(a ) ) , the exact methods applicable in the pure @xmath58 model , such as the cg method , can not be applied here .    assuming the short - range correlation between the disorder",
    ", we can study the self - averaging quantities such as the free energy and the translationally averaged correlation functions by calculating the quenched average @xcite .",
    "for example , neglecting the surface effects , the free energy of a large enough system a can be considered as a sum of the free energies of many macroscopically large subsystems of a each with a different realization . since by the short - range assumption these realizations are independent each other , the total free energy per site of a in the thermodynamical limit takes , with the probability one , the quenched averaged value defined by = _",
    "n_ < i , j > dt_ijp(t_ij ) ( -z)/n . [ fbar ] here , we have used the fact that a free energy per site of a subsystem with @xmath59 sites is given by @xmath60 .",
    "the overline is used to indicate the averaging over the distribution .",
    "it should be noted that , in this argument , we need a macroscopic number of macroscopically large subsystems .    in this paper , we use the replica method to evaluate the various quantities related to the quenched average of the free energy ( [ fbar ] ) .",
    "this method is based on the identity : z=_m0 .",
    "using this , the problem of calculating the quenched average @xmath61 is reduced to the task of obtaining another quenched average @xmath62 correctly for @xmath63 . to evaluate the latter ,",
    "we first prepare the @xmath64 layers of replicated inhomogeneous @xmath0 models with the same realization @xmath53 , and then take an average over the distribution . since , in general , the moments of the interaction @xmath48 are non - zero , the resulting theory is a coupled @xmath2 layers of @xmath0 models .",
    "we calculate the quantity @xmath62 for finite @xmath64 , take the limit @xmath1 in the end .",
    "this procedure gives , at least formally , gives the desired average .    .",

    "( b ) loops on several sheets of homogeneous lattices are coupled each other .",
    "an example of a term with the first order in the coupling @xmath65.,title=\"fig:\",width=294 ] [ replica ]    although we perform the detailed analysis in continuum theory , let us proceed , for a while , within the discrete lattice formulation .",
    "the purpose is two - fold : ( i ) to get some insight on underlying physics , as we can concretely see the elementary processes existing in the model and ( ii ) to see that there are possibly many lattice models described by the same continuum field theory .",
    "now , we consider the @xmath2 copies of the model ( [ ztn_dis ] ) and take the disorder average .",
    "this gives [ zmbart ] where in the last line , the first two moments are denoted as @xmath66 and @xmath67 , and we omit the terms with the higher moments for simplicity .",
    "the term @xmath68 represents a walk on the same replica layer ; the generic case with @xmath69 is discussed in the following .",
    "in addition to this , the theory acquires nonlinear couplings .",
    "for instance , when we look at a particular path of a loop , the coupling @xmath70 for @xmath71 is considered as a branching process across the replica direction as shown in figure [ figurelattice]-(b ) . on a lattice , evaluating directly the contribution of the diagrams with the second or higher orders in such processes should involve some sophisticated enumerative combinatorics .",
    "notice , however , that the translational invariance of the individual @xmath0 model is now restored .",
    "thus , in the continuum limit , we can use the knowledge of the homogeneous @xmath0 cft .",
    "the restriction on the sum to off - diagonal sector @xmath72 in the @xmath65 term follows from the fact that the original partition function ( [ ztn_dis ] ) is linear in the bonds @xmath73 .",
    "when we talk about the universality , however , this formal linearity and resulting off - diagonal property should be reconsidered ; we should rather consider a larger parameter space including more general couplings generated under block spin transformations .    in order to see this ,",
    "firstly , it is instructive to remind that the pure model ( [ ztn ] ) corresponds to the hamiltonian @xmath74 , and originates from the high temperature expansion of another spin system which has the same @xmath0 symmetry but has the different hamiltonian @xmath75 . from the rg perspective",
    ", these two models are regarded as two different points in the same theory space determined from the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "actually , both systems are believed to belong to the same universality class .",
    "in fact , with the knowledge of the scaling dimensions of fields obtained by the cg method @xcite , we may argue that these two hamiltonians are equivalent modulo irrelevant operators .",
    "in particular , the field @xmath76 represents the double occupancy of the bonds in the partition function , and the presence of it enables the loops to overlap .",
    "although such a field is not contained in the partition function ( [ ztn ] ) , it is natural to think that the term @xmath76 is generated , under block spin transformation , from the single occupation @xmath77 .",
    "but , as we will see in the end of section [ homogeneous ] , the term @xmath76 is irrelevant in the dilute phase , or equivalently , near the critical point . because of this",
    ", we can say that the linear expression ( [ ztn ] ) nicely summarize the characteristics of the dilute phase in generic models with the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "taking these considerations into account , we now briefly discuss the theory space of the coupled models derived from the disordered ones .",
    "our concern is near the decoupled critical point ; applying the knowledge of the pure @xmath0 model , we note the inessential differences that arise from different formulations of disordered models on a lattice .",
    "for concreteness , let us consider another disordered model : z=_s_i_ < ij>(_ijs_i s_j ) , [ zbetan ] with a bond distribution @xmath78 .",
    "the formal operations lead to , again , a coupled model : [ zmbarbeta ] where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the first and the second cumulants obtained from the distribution @xmath81 , respectively . comparing this model ( [ zmbarbeta ] ) with the previous one ( [ zmbart ] )",
    ", we notice that the differences between these two are simply the presence of the exponential function and that of the diagonal coupling : @xmath82 with @xmath83 in ( [ zmbarbeta ] ) .",
    "both features lead to the term @xmath84 _ i.e. _ the process of the double occupancy of the bonds on the same replica plane .",
    "such a term can also be generated in the model ( [ zmbart ] ) under block spin transformation .",
    "however , when the corresponding pure model is in the dilute phase , the process is irrelevant .",
    "for this reason , we expect both of the coupled models ( [ zmbart ] ) and ( [ zmbarbeta ] ) are described by a same field theory .",
    "a related model , which is more suitable for taking continuum limit , can be formulated with a probability distribution @xmath85 for disorders @xmath86 on each site : z=_s_i_ < ij > .",
    "[ zmun ] in this model , the bond strength @xmath87 respects a distribution @xmath88 obtained by the convolution of two @xmath89 _ i.e. _ @xmath90 .",
    "if this distribution @xmath91 is identical to the distribution @xmath78 in ( [ zbetan ] ) , then this model becomes similar to that of ( [ zbetan ] ) .",
    "still , the model ( [ zmun ] ) is different from the model ( [ zbetan ] ) , since there exists the correlation between the nearest - neighbor bonds ( say @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) connected at a site .",
    "nevertheless , the correlation is still short range ; we expect a similar behavior at large scales .",
    "we can argue that this correlation existing in the model ( [ zmun ] ) is not essential to distinguish it from the model ( [ zbetan ] ) by examining how these two models are mapped into the theory space of the coupled models .",
    "averaging over the disorder @xmath86 in ( [ zmun ] ) yields , at a site @xmath25 , a term @xmath94 as a leading nonlinear coupling .",
    "in particular , the @xmath95 part of this coupling is induced by the correlation between the nearest - neighbor bonds in the model ( [ zmun ] ) .",
    "if this coupling were , with some special reason , never generated in the model ( [ zmbarbeta ] ) mapped from ( [ zbetan ] ) , we would seriously distinguish ( [ zmun ] ) from ( [ zbetan ] ) in the first place .",
    "but , it has already been contained in ( [ zmbarbeta ] ) , implicitly . indeed ,",
    "although the expression ( [ zmbarbeta ] ) is written with respect to links , this can be recasted in terms of sites thanks to the discrete rotational and the discrete translational invariance of the coupled model on a lattice",
    ". then we recognize , by expanding the exponential , this coupling is also present in the model ( [ zmbarbeta ] ) .",
    "to summarize , in the dilute phase , there are two important processes on a lattice : the walk on the same layer @xmath96 and the branching to another layer @xmath97 for @xmath98 .",
    "it is plausible to think that these coupled models discussed here are , at large scales , described by a simple continuum field theory .",
    "when we approach a critical point of some lattice model defined in the dimension @xmath13 , the correlation length @xmath99 of the model , which is usually the order of the lattice cut - off @xmath100 , becomes arbitrary large .",
    "the continuum limit ( or , scaling limit ) of the lattice model can be reached by taking @xmath101 , while keeping @xmath102 fixed .",
    "there is nice class of local lattice observables @xmath103 which have the finite limit _",
    "a0a^-2(__1++__n)<_1^(x_1)_n^(x_n)>=<_1(x_1)_n(x_n ) > , for an appropriate choice of scaling dimensions @xmath104 . with the idea of the block spin transformation ,",
    "the scaling fields @xmath105 may be considered as coarse grained versions of @xmath106 over some region of size @xmath107 , centered at @xmath108 , with @xmath109 .",
    "these scaling dimensions are determined dynamically from the interactions in the system , and related to the rg eigenvalues @xmath110 via @xmath111 .",
    "when @xmath110 is positive ( negative ) , the rg flow near the critical point is unstable ( stable ) , and the corresponding observable and fields are relevant ( irrelevant ) .",
    "around the critical point in the theory space of the @xmath0 model , there are , at least , two directions which are unstable ( _ i.e. _ relevant ) under the rg flow to the infrared .",
    "these directions are spanned by the coupling constants associated with the two most important pairs @xmath112 of local lattice observables and the corresponding scaling fields . on the lattice side ,",
    "one is the energy density @xmath113 and the other is the spin vector @xmath114 . in the scaling limit ,",
    "they renormalize to become the scaling fields called the energy operator @xmath115 and the spin operator @xmath116 .",
    "the scaling dimension of @xmath117 and that of @xmath118 is related to the leading thermal and the leading magnetic eigenvalue of the spin system , respectively .",
    "these two positive eigenvalues correspond to the linearized rg flow near the critical point , and determine the thermodynamic exponents @xcite .",
    ".correspondence between lattice observables and continuum fields .",
    "the value of @xmath119 is given by @xmath120 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     so far , we have described the qualitative structure of the theory space focusing on the correspondence between the lattice observables and the continuum scaling fields .",
    "it is tantalizing that there is no versatile scheme for a given lattice model to establish this type of correspondence and to proceed to quantitative analysis using a scaling theory at hand .",
    "however , the @xmath0 model was particularly successful in this respect ; the geometric nature such as the loop representation of the partition function made it possible to access some of the exact results on the scaling dimensions by the cg method @xcite before the emergence of the conformal field theory @xcite .",

    "the branches @xmath474 and @xmath321 , for instance , correspond to the regularization in the @xmath508-plane with the sequence @xmath522 and @xmath523 , respectively .",
    "each regularization has a certain factor on it due to the presence of the branch cuts.,width=529 ]      by a suitable change of variables , the integral in ( [ j1 + ] ) is transformed into an integral over the unit cube : j_1^+=_0 ^ 1 d_0 ^ 1 d_0 ^ 1 d  ^2+a+2a+2f+g(1-)^b & ^1+a+a+f(1-)^g ^a(1-)^f + & ( 1-)^f ( 1-)^b ( 1-)^b. in general , all of @xmath404 in ( [ j1+])-([j3- ] ) can be cast into the same form , namely , j_l^=_0 ^ 1 d_0 ^ 1 d_0 ^ 1 d  ^-1(1-)^-1 & ^-1(1-)^-1 ^-1(1-)^-1 + & ( 1-)^-p ( 1-)^-q ( 1-)^-r , [ j * ] with each different set of exponents @xmath524 . in this paper ,",
    "the value of the triple integral in the right hand side of ( [ j * ] ) is denoted as a compact symbol :                                  performing the binomial expansion for the last three factors in ( [ j * ] ) , we get the following triple hypergeometric series : j_l^&=_l^s_l^ , + _ l^&= , [ gamma_l ] + s_l^&=_i=0^_j=0^_k=0^ , [ s_l ] where the pochhammer symbol @xmath526 is used . the parameters @xmath524 is related to the exponents @xmath527 in ( [ i ] ) as indicated in ( [ j_parameters ] ) .",
    "this series representation is particularly useful when some of @xmath528 are non - positive integer plus @xmath219 . in that case ,",

    "we now derive the first one of these three relations for an illustration .",
    "since it is the analyticity of the integrand on the region except the branch cuts that makes the relation valid , the basic strategy is to deform successively each integration path defined on each complex plane . to keep track of the successive deformations of the integration paths on the three complex planes , we use a simple semicircular diagram to represent the regularization of the interval ( see figure [ reg_circles ] ) .",
    "consider the @xmath487-plane in which all the branch cuts are taken along the real axis from each branch point to positive infinity .",
    "since the integrand has no branch points except the non - negative real axis , the integral along the contour @xmath321 in figure [ contour_cc ] is zero .",
    "then the @xmath487-integral on a regularized interval @xmath533 $ ] can be expressed by a certain linear combination of the integral on the intervals @xmath534 $ ] , @xmath535 $ ] and @xmath536 $ ] as shown in the first equality in figure [ successive ] .",
    "each coefficient comes from the pairing of the two segments which lie on opposite sides of the branch cuts . in this way",
