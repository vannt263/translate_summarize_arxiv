    "up to now , there is no global agreement on the interpretation of light mesons with vacuum quantum numbers : the scalar mesons@xcite . at least , one can list two isovectors @xmath1 and @xmath3 , five isoscalars @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and finally three isodoublets @xmath7 and @xmath8 . one possible way to understand the light scalar spectrum may be to classify scalars according to their masses , i.e. below and beyond one gev . following this proposal ,",
    "a first group with masses below one gev ( first nonet ) contains @xmath0 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath1 .",
    "a second group with a mass beyond one gev ( second nonet ) includes @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath6 and @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , scalar mesons within their own group are built up according to the hypercharge , @xmath13 , and the isospin projection along the z - axis , @xmath14 .",
    "the latter group being beyond the scope of this note , let us focus on the former group of light scalars so - called the first @xmath15 nonet .",
    "following the spirit of the quark model , the @xmath0 meson with quantum numbers @xmath16 , the @xmath9 meson with quantum numbers @xmath17 , the @xmath10 meson with quantum numbers @xmath16 and the @xmath1 meson with quantum numbers @xmath18 constitute altogether the first scalar meson nonet given in fig.[figsu3 ] .",
    "nonet__,title=\"fig : \" ]    regarding masses and widths , from the pdg@xcite , one has @xmath19@xmath20@xmath21 , @xmath22@xmath23 @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "various theoretical approaches in the study of different processes yield the following values for the pole of the @xmath0@xcite : @xmath26 for the pole of the @xmath9@xcite : @xmath27 for the pole of the @xmath10@xcite : @xmath28 and for the pole of the @xmath1@xcite : @xmath29 this non - exhaustive list of experimental and theoretical values underlines very well the difficulties we have in understanding the structure and properties of the scalar mesons .      unlike the difficulties to describe scalar mesons within a consistent theoretical framework , there are clear and unambiguous experimental evidences@xcite of light scalar mesons",
    ". some of these indications also give crucial informations on their internal quark structure .",
    "let us start with a few experimental signals provided by several collaborations .",
    "regarding the @xmath0 meson@xcite , which mainly decays into @xmath30 , it has been observed in various processes .",
    "the phase shift of elastic @xmath30 scattering , when applying the watson theorem and roy equations , indicates the existence of @xmath0 .",
    "the e791 and focus collaborations using isobar model ( sum of breit wigner resonances ) have also reported the @xmath0 meson in @xmath31 decay .",
    "another way of observing @xmath0 is related to the @xmath32 central production ( gams collaboration ) where a double pomeron ( @xmath33 ) governs the process at small momentum transfers between the protons .",
    "the bes and dm2 experiments have also noticed the @xmath0 meson when the @xmath30 angular distribution in @xmath34 was analyzed . for the @xmath35 meson@xcite , which mainly decays into @xmath36 , two different analysis have drawn positive conclusions on its existence : firstly , the phase shift of elastic @xmath36 scattering which was obtained from pion production by the lass collaboration or from @xmath37 by the focus collaboration .",
    "secondly , the e791 collaboration has also used an isobar model applied to @xmath37 decay requires the @xmath35 for having a good fit of angular distributions . as regards the @xmath10 meson@xcite , which mainly decays into @xmath38 and @xmath39 ,",
    "two major observations have been made .",
    "the bes ii collaboration in @xmath40 and @xmath41 decays has found prominent signals when data were fitted with a flatt formula .",
    "another signal has also been observed in @xmath42 decay by the e791 collaboration .",
    "the dalitz plot analysis leads to suggest that a significant contribution is assumed to come from the @xmath43 channel and hence gives an experimental evidence of the scalar @xmath10 . concerning the @xmath1 meson@xcite , which mainly decays into @xmath44 , one of the first signal",
    "was provided by the e852 collaboration using the @xmath45 reaction at @xmath46 .",
    "the mass and width of the @xmath1 meson were independently determined so that it gave a first clear signal of this scalar state .",
    "the internal quark structure of light scalar is still controversial and only experimental observations can be used to test theoretical hypothesis@xcite . for example , let us consider here the case of @xmath10 where several collaborations have confirmed the @xmath47 component of @xmath10 : the branching ratios ( provided by the collaboration dm2 as well as by the pdg ) of @xmath48 and of @xmath49 being different leads to a quark mixing in terms of @xmath50 and @xmath47 in @xmath10 .",
    "finally , let us have a look at the @xmath1 scalar for which the collaboration kloe@xcite has given the branching ratios for radiative @xmath51 decays : @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the radiative decay @xmath54 which can not proceed if @xmath1 is a @xmath55 state can be however nicely described in the kaon loop mechanism .",
    "this suggests a admixture of the @xmath56 component ( 4-quark state ) which is in contradiction with assuming @xmath1 as a 2-quark state .",
    "altogether , observing that @xmath1 and @xmath10 are almost degenerate , one should have a @xmath47 component in @xmath1 that can not be since it is an @xmath57 state .",
    "the fundamental structure of scalar mesons remaining unclear , together with the difficulties related to experimental observation of the effects of light scalars in different processes , have generated a large variety of theoretical models on the market , each of them claiming to explain the structure of light scalars below and beyond one gev .",
    "at least , five open - roads can be followed : the simplest one is the well - known @xmath58 state for describing light scalars , then the @xmath58 state plus glueball , then the four quark states @xmath59@xmath60 , and finally the mesonic molecules .",
    "let us give a brief overview of their main characteristics@xcite .",
    "a ) the @xmath58 state model where the @xmath58 l=0 nonet ( @xmath61 , @xmath1 and @xmath10 ) is basically built up similarly to the @xmath58 l=1 nonet ( @xmath62 ... ) .",
    "this model however can not explain why @xmath1 and @xmath10 are not degenerate , why the @xmath1 and @xmath0 have the same number of non strange quarks but are not degenerate , etc ... b ) the @xmath58 state plus glueball model where , according qcd expectations , the lightest glueball should be a scalar particle with quantum numbers @xmath63 . in such scenario ,",
    "the glueball is considered as a very broad object with a width of the order of its mass .",
    "it works rather well for scalar particles with masses beyond one gev .",
    "c ) the four quark states @xmath59@xmath60 model which allows one to have two configurations in color space : @xmath64 and @xmath65 . they can therefore rearrange to form a @xmath66 scalar state .",
    "d ) finally , the mesonic molecule model which is similar to the @xmath59@xmath60 case but considering only mesonic degree of freedom ( color singlet ) such as @xmath67 exchange for example .",
    "in our toy model , decay amplitudes for @xmath68 to scalar and pseudoscalar mesons are evaluated by making use of the weak effective hamiltonian at low energy together with qcd factorization .",
    "the associated branching ratios are compared to the experimental ones .",
    "it leads to make predictions on transition form factors between pseudoscalar ( @xmath2 and @xmath69 ) and scalar ( @xmath0 @xmath70 and @xmath1 ) mesons .",
    "we take advantage of these d decays to efficiently constrain , first the scalar meson wave functions and , then the transition form factors derived within a covariant relativistic formalism .    in covariant light front dynamics@xcite(clfd ) , the state vector , which describes the physical bound state is defined on the light - front plane given by the equation @xmath71 . here",
    ", @xmath72 denotes an unspecified light - like four - vector ( @xmath73 ) which determines the position of the light - front plane and @xmath74 is a four - vector position of the system .",
    "any four vector describing a phenomenon can be transformed from one system of reference to another one by using a unique standard matrix which depends only on kinematic parameters and on @xmath72 .",
    "the particle is described by a wave function expressed in terms of fock components of the state vector which respects the properties required under any transformation .      for a scalar particle composed of an antiquark and a quark of same constituent mass , @xmath75 ,",
    "the general structure of the two - body bound state has the form : @xmath76 where @xmath77 $ ] is the scalar component of the wave function . @xmath78 and @xmath79 are parameters to be determined from experimental @xmath69 branching ratios ( @xmath80 or @xmath81 ) and theoretical assumptions .      in clfd ,",
    "the approximate transition amplitude between a pseudoscalar , @xmath82 , and a scalar , @xmath83 , explicitly depends on the light front orientation : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a non - physical form factor which has to be zero in any exact calculation .",
    "simple algebraic calculations allow us to extract the physical transition form factors @xmath86 , by means of the amplitude @xmath87 : @xmath88   \\frac{1}{1-x^{\\prime}}\\ , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] which is derived from the usual triangular diagram describing transitions between mesons .",
    "@xmath89 is the invariant phase space element and @xmath90 and @xmath91 denote respectively the initial pseudoscalar and final scalar wave functions . for more informations on the clfd approach ,",
    "we refer the reader to the paper@xcite .",
    "using normalization and @xmath69 experimental branching ratios one can model the wave function of scalar mesons for which some @xmath92 distributions are given in fig .  [ exfig]a ) .",
    "one can also make predictions on transition form factors between pseudoscalar and scalar mesons as shown ( similar results for @xmath93 transitions ) in fig .",
    "[ exfig]b ) .",
    "all the results given here are only qualitative due to some uncertainties among them the experimental @xmath69 branching ratios , the 2-quark description assumption and the meson and quark mass effects .",
    "it is therefore crucial to improve our understanding of scalar mesons as they play a major role when analyzing for example the @xmath94 violation asymmetry in @xmath95 .",
    "better one knows the unitarity triangle , better one can looks for new physics effects , however tiny they may be .",
