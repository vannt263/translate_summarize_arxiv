    "one of the earliest results from infrared ( ir ) astronomy was the discovery of ` excess ' ir radiation by heated circumstellar dust from a variety of stars having emission - line spectra .",
    "amongst these were four wc9 type wolf  rayet ( wr ) stars , ve245 (= wr104 ) , hd 313643 (= wr106 ) , ls  15 (= wr119 ) and as  320 (= wr121 ) , observed by allen , harvey & swings ( 1972 ) and , at longer wavelengths , by gehrz & hackwell ( 1974 ) .",
    "cohen , barlow & kuhi ( 1975 ) measured optical ",
    "ir energy distributions of wr stars and showed that they could be matched by either free - free or graphite dust emission .",
    "the enduring interest of dust formation by some wc type wr stars is the great difficulty of forming dust in such hostile environments : close to the stars , the stellar radiation fields heat any dust to above its evaporation temperature but , at greater distances where the radiation field is sufficiently diluted for the grains to survive in radiative equilibrium , the density in an isotropic wc stellar wind is too low to allow homonuclear dust condensation .",
    "this was recognised by hackwell , gehrz & grasdalen ( 1979 ) in the case of the wc7+o5 type episodic dust - maker hd 193793 (= wr140 ) and discussed by williams , van der hucht & th ( 1987 ) for the wc89 stars making dust persistently .",
    "high - density structures in the wc winds are required to allow dust formation .",
    "two classes of high - density structure are suggested by the observed incidence and phenomenology of dust formation : large - scale structures generated by the compression of the wc wind where it collides with the wind of a luminous companion in a binary system  a colliding wind binary ( cwb )  and isolated clumps in stellar winds probably related to those observed spectroscopically by moffat et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , moffat & robert ( 1991 ) and lpine & moffat ( 1999 ) .",
    "usov ( 1991 ) modelled cwbs and suggested that very high compression factors ( @xmath0 ) could be produced in wr140 if the heated and compressed wind was able to cool efficiently .",
    "the ir light curves show that dust formation in wr140 occurs only very near periastron passage in its highly elliptical 8-y orbit ( williams et al .",
    "1990 ) , presumably related to the increase by factor of @xmath1 40 of the pre - shock wind density at the wind - collision region ( wcr ) around this phase ( williams 1999 ) .",
    "such phase - locking occurs in other episodic dust - making systems such as the @xmath2-yr wc7+o system hd 192641 (= wr137 ) ( williams et al .",
    "2001 , lefvre et al .",
    "2005 ) .    the connection between dust formation by the wc89 stars and their movement in binary orbits comes from ir images of the dust which show rotating ` pinwheel ' structures around systems like wr104 , interpreted to be dust formed and ejected in a stream to one side of a rotating binary system observed at a low orbital inclination ( tuthill , monnier & danchi 1999 , tuthill et al .",
    "further dust ` pinwheels ' have been observed around other wc89 stars , ( cf .",
    "monnier et al .",
    "2007 )  but binary orbits are required to confirm the picture .",
    "dust formation in clumps in wr winds deduced from their eclipsing the light of the wr star was first suggested independently from spectroscopy of wr104 by crowther ( 1997 ) and from photometry of wr121 and wr103 by veen et al .",
    "compared with earlier observations , the spectrum of wr104 observed in 1996 showed selective obscuration of the high - ionization emission lines , formed in the core of the wc9 wind , allowing crowther to set a stringent limit on the projected size ( @xmath3 ) of the obscuring dust clump using a model of the wr104 wind .",
    "spectra observed by williams & van der hucht ( 2000 , hereafter wh00 ) showed that the strengths of the cii and ciii lines had partly recovered from crowther s 1996 eclipse by mid-1997 , and that they had been near ` normal ' in mid-1995 , a year before it .",
    "tighter timing of a dust eclipse was provided by veen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who observed wr121 during and emerging from an 0.8-mag eclipse in 1990 .",
    "the flux took about 10  d. to recover to its normal level .",
    "multi - colour observations showed that the eclipse was deeper at shorter wavelengths , suggesting that it was caused by extinction by dust particles .",
    "a shallower ( 0.4-mag . ) eclipse of wr103 also showed colour changes indicative of varying dust extinction .",
    "this star had previously shown isolated eclipses ( massey , lundstrm & stenholm 1984 ) , but they were not ascribed to dust formation .",
    "another deep eclipse by wr121 in _ hipparcos _ @xmath4 data was observed by veen et al . and marchenko et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , but its time - scale was not well defined because the observations of this star did not cover the whole event .",
    "better defined is the deep ( @xmath5-mag . ) , apparently multiple , eclipse by wr106 observed by kato et al .",
    "( 2002a ) in 2000 in a photometric study running from 1994 to mid-2002 .",
    "the observations were in a single passband , like the @xmath4 data , so interpretation in terms of dust absorption is by analogue with the multi - wavelength observations of eclipses . on a smaller scale , variable",
    "circumstellar extinction by dust was invoked by fahed , moffat & bonanos ( 2009 ) to explain the low amplitude ( 0.06-mag . ) variations of wr76 observed in their two - band ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) photometric survey of 20 wc89 stars .",
    "kato et al . ( 2002b ) observed significant ( 2.7-mag . ) variations in the light from wr104 , with the star at its faintest near the time of crowther s spectroscopy , supporting the suggestion that the variations were caused by variable dust extinction .",
    "they found a period of 241  d. in their data , close to that of the pinwheel orbit , and suggested that the dust eclipses were phase - locked to the orbit and caused by some of the dust plume creating the pinwheel entering our line of sight .",
    "further optical photometry of wr104 in the all - sky automated survey ( asas-3 , pojmaski 2002 ) allowed reinvestigation of this suggestion .",
    "a dataset combining the observations by kato et al . with the then available asas-3 observations , duly shifted to allow for the different passbands , showed ( williams 2008 ) no phasing of the optical photometry with the pinwheel period .",
    "the asas-3 is now complete , prompting revisiting the variations of wr104 , and extension of the study to a search for eclipses by other dust - forming wc89 stars .",
    "the prime goal is examination of the incidence of eclipses  most of which had previously been discovered serendipitously  as a step to investigating the significance of this mode of dust formation amongst wc89 stars as a possible alternative to formation in cwbs , with particular relevance to the wc89 stars without luminous companions .",
    "the asas-3 database is well suited to this , covering the region of the galactic plane occupied by the dust - making wc89 stars and containing observations made over a long time span ( 20012009 ) which , allowing for the gaps between the stars observing seasons , provide the equivalent of @xmath1 5  yr continuous photometry of each . the limiting magnitude is almost 15 and stars as bright as @xmath8 can be observed without saturation ( pojmaski 2002 ) , allowing inclusion of the brighter wc89 stars . as already noted ,",
    "the interpretation of abrupt falls in single - passband photometry as obscuration by dust clumps is by analogue with the multi - wavelength studies of similar objects ; but the present paper will proceed using this assumption , and follow veen et al . (",
    "1998 ) in calling the phenomena eclipses .",
    "such eclipses can tell us about varying dust absorption along a narrow column towards the stars ; in contrast , the ir emission gives the total amount of dust around the stars close enough to be heated by the stellar radiation and re - emit in the ir . in this paper , the designation of stars as dust - makers or dust - free is on the basis of their ir spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",

    "the asas-3 observations are flagged by quality ( ` a  d ' ) , and only stars having at least 100 a - quality ( best ) data were used for this study .",
    "the photometry is provided through a range of apertures ( 26 pixels , where a pixel = 15 arc sec ) , with a suggested ` default ' aperture chosen on the basis of the object s brightness , smaller for the fainter objects .",
    "we began using the ` default ' apertures but in each case checked the scatter in the photomtery in other apertures ; in a very few cases the scatter was found to less in an aperture other than the default , and the data measured through that aperture were used .",

    "the light curves near each of the outliers were examined in detail to see if the outliers could represent real eclipses . where the low values were not supported by the preceeding or following observations , they were considered to be artefacts of the observations and unreliable  apparently a characteristic of the dataset .    with the single exception of wr50",
    ", none of the dust - free stars in table [ stars ] showed evidence for eclipse - like variation .",

    "the spectrum of wr50 shows absorption lines ( van der hucht et al .",
    "1981 ; smith , shara & moffat 1990 ) so wr50 is most probably a binary  but apparently lacks an orbit .       for wr106 ; in this case the @xmath12 for the dotted lines ( 0.06 mag . ) was that read from the dispersion curve ( fig.[fvmedsig ] ) for the brightness of wr106.,width=321 ]        the asas-3 light curve ( fig.[wr106all ] ) of wr106 shows deep eclipses in 2003 and 2007 , the second eclipse in 2007 having a double minimum separated by @xmath1 46 d. with perhaps a third , lower amplitude , one between them ( fig.[ec106 ] ) .",

    "eclipse in the asas-3 data could be the two fainter magnitudes in 2004.2 which were observed within 4  d. of each other and are therefore probably not observational outliers ; the flux was near normal 2  d. before the first observation and again 4  d. after the second , making it a very brief event .",
    "the other low points in 2006 and 2008 in the light curve are isolated outliers .",
    "the kato et al .",
    "( 2002a ) and asas-3 datasets overlap in 20012 , so that the two taken together provide coverage from 1994.1 to 2009.8 , but with a number of gaps , mostly seasonal . to estimate the completeness of coverage with respect to discovery of deep eclipses like those observed",
    ", we note that the 2003 eclipse and the first in 2007 each lasted about 60  d. , so that at least part of such an eclipse would still be observed if there was a gap of no more than 0.1  yr . in the observations . omitting the larger gaps in coverage",
    ", we then have the equivalent of 9.9  yr of continous photometric monitoring during which six deep minima , four of them in close pairs , were observed .",
    "if the six minima were independent events , their distribution is far from poissonian .",
    "for example , if we divided the 9.9 period into 33 intervals of 0.3  yr , an interval long enough to include the double eclipses but not so long as to include both the single and double eclipses in 2007 , we have a rate of 6/33 = 0.182 eclipses per interval .",
    "a poissonian distribution would have 27.5 intervals with no eclipse , 5.0 with one eclipse , 0.45 with two eclipse , etc .",
    " far from what is observed .",
    "the numbers are too small for a conclusion , but this suggests that the double eclipses are integral events rather than the close proximity of independent single eclipses .",
    "this suggestion is supported by the apparent minor eclipse ( depending on two observations separated by 2  d. ) between the two components of the 2007 double eclipse , and would be strengthened if the apparent eclipses on the rising branches of the 2003.7 and 2007.2 eclipses were real ( fig.[ec106 ] ) .",
    "the 2003 and the first 2007 eclipses show a slower recovery than fading , 36 and 44  d. , compared with fadings of 0.6 mag in 17 and 10 d. respectively .",
    "the recovery from the double eclipse was much faster , 17  d. to rise by 0.9  mag .",
    "if we interpret the rise times as the lifetimes of the dust clumps as they rise through the stellar wind in our direction , the simplest explanation of the shorter lifetimes is that the trajectories of the clumps make a small angle to our line of sight and they pass out of it sooner than if the trajectories were exactly aligned to our line of sight .",
    "the particular interest of formation of dust in clumps by wr106 is that it is not obviously a cwb : wh00 searched for , but did not observe , balmer absorption lines attributable to an ob companion to the wc9 star in its spectrum .",

    "( 2002b ) during 19942001 in showing almost continuous variation , and it differs significantly from all the other stars observed in not having long runs of apparently constant flux .",
    "evidently , wr104 suffers more eclipses than any other wc9 star observed in this or previous studies , apparently an almost continuous string of eclipses having a range of depths , and sometimes overlapping .",
    "another possible explanation for the variations is variable extinction caused by some of the dust formed in the colliding - wind system entering our line of sight , as proposed by kato et al .",
    "( 2002b ) .",
    "they found a period equal to the ` pinwheel ' rotation period in their photometric data but , as noted above , this was not supported in a preliminary study using their photometry and some early asas-3 data ( williams 2008 ) .",
    "it is now possible to repeat the period search using the whole asas-3 dataset for wr104 , 617 observations compared with 146 used by kato et al .",
    "the datasets were not combined this time as the kato et al .",
    "data are of lower accuracy ( 0.20.3 mag . ) than the asas-3 data , and are in a different photometric band ( unfiltered 400600 nm ) .",
    "a search for periods in the range 200300 d. using phase dispersion minimization ( pdm , stellingwerf 1978 ) showed no evidence for a period near that ( 241.5  d. , tuthill et al .",
    "2008 ) of the ` pinwheel ' rotation .",
    "the data were then phase - folded with the 241.5-d . period ( fig.[ph104 ] ) , giving the pdm statistic @xmath18 , and do not show the large - scale phased variation of extinction found by kato et al .",
    "the latter used 15 phase bins for their phased light curve in contrast to the 50 used here , which seems the minimum number needed to capture the variations of wr104 .",
    "inspection of the light curve shows well - defined changes of 0.10.2 mag .",
    ", compared with 0.1 mag . for the expected observational error , on the time scale of the p/50 phase bins ,",
    "so wider phase bins would smother these variations .",
    "phased light curves using narrower binning were also investigated , but none showed systematic variation .",
    "the large dispersions seen in some of the phase bins is a consequence of stochastic occurence of deep eclipses independent of the orbital period .",
    "there are so many eclipses that the median @xmath6 is not a good measure of the undisturbed flux level , which is estimated to lie near @xmath17 from inspection of the light curve . omitting gaps in the observing exceeding 0.1  yr",
    ", we have the equivalent of 4.8  yr of continuous photometric coverage , during which wr104 was brighter than @xmath19 ( 1 @xmath12 below the estimated undisturbed level ) for only about 0.64  yr , implying that eclipses were occurring for seven - eighths of the time . from the light curves ,",
    "14 eclipses were identified ; some completely observed , and others inferred from well - defined but isolated brightening or fading at the ends of observing runs , of which three had amplitudes in the range 1.52.0 mag .",

    ", and three ( probably an underestimate ) in 0.50.9 mag . , giving an average rate of 3.4  yr@xmath20 , also probably an underestimate .",
    "the light curves show much wider minima than the eclipses shown by wr106 , but this might be caused by the partial overlapping of individual events .",
    "for example ( fig.[ec104 ] ) , there was a reasonably well defined eclipse in 2005 , but its recovery appears to have been interrupted by another eclipse , so estimation of the recovery time and clump lifetime comes from measuring the brightening rates , giving @xmath1 40  d. in 2007 , there was an even broader minimum , but it is not obvious whether this was caused by a single clump or several  the data in the second half of 2007 are very sparse , with a gap of 65  d. between the last two observations , and one of 110-d . between the last and the first observations in 2008 . during 2008 ,",
    "the light curve looks like noise , but closer examination shows @xmath1 1-mag eclipses in 2008.4 and 2008.6 .",
    "again it was not possible to measure recovery times or clump lifetimes as the recoveries were interupted .",
    "gaps in the coverage make other events harder to characterise , but the steady rise of 0.9 mag . in 0.18",
    "yr in 2002 , recovery from an earlier eclipse , suggests a clump lifetime of at least 66  d.       for wr69 with appropriate median and errors .",

    "this very great discrepancy in observed eclipse rates suggests a significant difference between the winds of wr104 and wr106 and those of the other wc89 stars observed : greater than the high end of a continuous distribution of properties .",
    "an alternative to the very uneven distribution of clump formation in wc9 winds is that all the stars form clumps at rates comparable to wr104 and wr106 , but that the clumps are confined to narrowly collimated streams , and that only these two stars are favourably inclined to the observer . in this picture , the streams of clumps from the stars showing occasional eclipses have trajectories making slightly larger angles with our line of sight .",
    "the problem with this explanation is that it runs contrary to the spectroscopic study of the radial velocities of clumps in wr winds , which show their trajectories to have a range of angles to the line of sight ( moffat & robert 1991 ; robert 1994 ; lpine & moffat 1999 ) , and that it is most unlikely that the two sorts of clump would be formed in such different ways .",
    "the eclipse rates can be compared with the circumstellar dust clouds , as measured by the fractions of the stellar ultraviolet ",
    "visible flux which they absorb and re - radiate in the ir . for wr104 and wr106 , these are about 60 and 23 per cent respectively , compared with 110 per cent ( williams et al .",
    "1987 ) for the other dust makers in this study . amongst the latter , wr80 and wr96 re - radiate approximately 9.5 per cent of their stellar flux in the ir but have not shown eclipses , whereas the stars showing a few eclipses , wr69 , wr95 , wr117 and perhaps wr121 have re - radiation rates between 1.7 and 5.8 per cent , and wr50 is not a known dust maker ; so the correlation is not strong .",
    "unfortunately , the other stars shown by williams et al .",
    "( 1987 ) to have high ir re - radiation rates , wr48a , wr76 and wr118 , are all too faint for the present study ( fahed et al .",
    "( 2009 ) did not observe any eclipses by wr76 in their study , but the photometry covered only 18  d. ) fainter wc89 dust makers , including wr48a and wr76 , should be observable in the currently progressing surveys such as asas-4 and ogle - iv ( cf .",
    "pietrucowicz et al .",
    "the photometric coverage of at least some of the stars in the present study should be extended to improve our knowledge of the incidence of eclipses in stars like wr121 and to investigate the possible double or multiple eclipses apparently shown by wr106 .    to study the connection between the dust formed in clumps and that making up the circumstellar dust reservoirs responsible for the ir emission , consider what happens to the dust .",
    "the clump apparently starts close to the wc star ( crowther 1997 , veen et al .",
    "1998 ) and moves out with the wind .",
    "the dust condenses quickly , judging by the fading times of the eclipses .",
    "as the dust absorbs stellar radiation , it heats up and re - radiates in the ir until either it gets so hot that the dust evaporates , or the clump has moved away from the star sufficiently quickly that the geometric dilution of the stellar radiation heating it is no longer enough to heat it above evaporation temperature . by the end of the eclipse , either the dust has been destroyed , or the dust has survived but the clump has dissipated sufficiently that it no longer provides enough visual absorption to produce a measurable eclipse  but , of course , continues absorbing and re - radiating in the ir .",
    "there are two time - scales : the kinematic time for the dust to reach a safe distance ( e.g. about 25 au in the case of wr104 from the modelling by harries et al .",
    "2004 ) which would be @xmath29  d. at an average speed of 1200 km  s@xmath20 , the terminal velocity of the wind .",
    "this may be optimistic , the initial acceleration of clumps is rather slow ( e.g. lpine & moffat 1999 ) , but radiation pressure will accelerate the dust to move faster than the wind in which it condensed .",
    "the other time - scale is that for the dust being heated in the stellar radiation field to reach its evaporation temperature .",
    "this needs to be modelled , particularly the properties of the original clump and the shielding it must provide to the condensing and newly formed dust  which is beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "we can see , however , that the kinematic time - scale is comparable to the recovery times of eclipses , so it seems possible that dust formed in clumps is surviving long enough to reach the ` safe ' distance and contribute to the circumstellar dust reservoir .",
    "simultaneous optical and ir observations during a dust eclipse would be invaluable in measuring the brightening in the ir and temperature of the dust clump as it moves out in the stellar wind .",
    "one star , wr70 was observed frequently in the ir during the present study , varying with a range of @xmath30 ( williams et al .",
    "2013 ) , but its asas-3 @xmath6 magnitudes showed no eclipses or other variation , so the variations in dust emission must be ascribed to changes in its wc9+b0i wind - collision system .      the absence of variable extinction associated with the orbital motion in wr104 is unsurprising considering the geometry . we know from the spectroscopy in 199597 that dust was in front of the wc9 star and not the ob companion .",
    "the winds collide between the stars , and the dust is formed further from the wc9 star , beyond the ob companion , in a well - collimated beam ( opening angle @xmath31 , cf .",
    "harries et al .",
    "2004 ) in the orbital plane , which lies almost in the plane of the sky given the low inclination , @xmath32 . only in an inclined system like wr140 ,",
    "is some of the cwb dust modelled to pass in front of the star ( williams et al .",
    "2009 ) and cause the minor eclipses observed shortly after periastron passage ( marchenko et al .",
    "2003 ) , when the cwb dust formation was briefly active .",
    "the high eccenticity of its orbit results in the projected position angle of the wind - collision system swinging through more than @xmath33 on the sky in only @xmath34 around periastron and the dust to be spread very unevenly around the stars .",
    "the ir images of wr104 ( tuthill et al .",
    "2008 ) can be used to infer the relative importance to the circumstellar dust reservoir of formation in clumps and formation in the wc9+ob wind - collision system responsible for the dust pinwheel .",
    "if dust made in clumps responsible for the eclipses is significant , we would expect to see evidence in the form of extended , possibly clumpy , diffuse emission centred on the star in the ir images .",
    "the very observation of pinwheel structures , however , demonstrates that most of the dust emission is in the pinwheel ; the composite 2-@xmath35 m image ( tuthill et al . 2008 , fig.8 ) shows no dust emission above 0.1 per cent of the peak between the arms .",
    "this demonstrates that dust formation in clumps is not an important contributor to the total dust being formed by wr104  either because comparatively little dust is being made in this process , or because the dust in the clumps does not survive long enough to reach the ` safe ' distance .    if instead of isotropic clump formation",
    ", we consider that wr104 owes its high rate of observed eclipses to a collimated beam and our favoured viewing angle , we might expect the ir images to show a bright spot in the centre : emission by a column of surviving clump dust .",
    "there is no evidence for this ; on the contrary , the images show a ` standoff distance ' of 13  mas ( tuthill et al .",
    "2008 ) , the ` safe ' distance above , between the brightest dust pixel and the spiral centre , interpreted as the stars , where no emission is seen .    in either case",
    ", it is evident that the star having by far the highest rate of eclipses is not receiving a significant contribution to its circumstellar dust cloud by this process .",
    "we need to know more about the wr104 eclipses from multi - colour photometry over a wide wavelength range to make sure that the extinction really is by dust and to measure its properties .",
    "large amplitude ( @xmath36 ) variability was found in the first results from the bochum southern galactic disk survey ( haas et al .",
    "2012 ) and the combination of such photometry with contemporaneous @xmath6 in the asas-4 survey over the next few years would be valuable . also , wr104 would be a good candidate for simultaneous ir and optical photometry to determine the behaviour of the dust on the recovery branches of the eclipses .",
    "of the 16 dust - making wc89 stars surveyed , most of the eclipses were observed from just two stars , wr106 and wr104 , while the other 14 stars showed only 34 eclipses , none as deep as those in wr104 or wr106 .",
    "it is evident from the ir images of wr104 that any dust formed in the eclipses is not a significant contributor to its circumstellar dust cloud .",
    "the implication of this is that dust formed in occasional eclipses by the other wc89 dust makers is also an insignificant contributor to their dust clouds , so that the question of how wc9 stars which are not members of cwbs make their dust still remains open .",
    "the two stars with the highest eclipse rates also have the most luminous dust clouds in the ir and , although dust formed in clumps may not contribute to the circumstellar dust directly , cwbs having higher rates of clumps in the wc9 winds might be more efficient dust makers .",
