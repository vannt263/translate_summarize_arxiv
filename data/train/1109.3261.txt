    "diffuse extended radio sources with elongated or filamentary morphologies that can not be identified with any unique optically detected galaxy are termed as radio relics ( e.g. see the review by ferrari et al .",
    "the arclike radio relics that are typically found around massive and dynamically disturbed galaxy clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are proposed to be electrons accelerated at shock fronts by the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism @xcite .",
    "the accelerated electrons could be those from the thermal pool of the galaxy cluster or the old mildly relativistic population due to active galaxies @xcite .",
    "apart from the @xmath7 mpc size arc - like relics , there are relics that have smaller sizes ( @xmath8 kpc ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these have been proposed to be lurking lobes of radio galaxies or adiabatically compressed lobes of radio galaxies by shock waves @xcite .",
    "regardless of their origin , radio relics are basically clouds of relativistic electrons and magnetic fields that evolve over timescales of @xmath7 ten million years which is the lifetime of the synchrotron emitting electrons .",
    "synchrotron emission , adiabatic expansion and inverse compton scattering of the cmb photons are the mechanisms by which the radio relics lose energy .",
    "the energy losses due to synchrotron and inverse - compton scattering depend on the square of the energy of the electrons and thus produce steepening in their spectra . therefore to study the evolution of the radio relics ,",
    "a multi - frequency approach is essential . in a multi - frequency study by @xcite , integrated spectra of radio relics",
    "were modelled as evolving lobes of radio galaxies losing energy by synchrotron emission and inverse - compton scattering ( energy loss due to expansion was not considered ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of spectral indices over the extent of the relic gives important clues about its origin .",
    "for example , a relic created at a shock front shows an edge of young , flat spectrum plasma and a gradual steepening of spectra behind the edge .",
    "such trends have been mapped in a few arclike double radio relics such as a2345 , a1240 @xcite , zwcl @xmath9 , ciza j2242.8@xmath105301 , zwcl @xmath11 @xcite and a few arc - like single relics such as a2256 @xcite , a521 @xcite and a2744 @xcite .",

    "the relativistic plasma that forms the relics has been considered to originate from a radio galaxy in the eg01 model . over time , the host galaxy would have moved and may not have an agn any more , preventing identification .",

    ". the cd galaxy could be the progenitor of the relic but the evidence is not sufficient to rule out other progenitors .",
    "the 150 and 325 mhz images presented above are the first low frequency images of the relic in a1664 .",
    "these have yielded an estimate of the spectral index of the relic between 150 and 1400 mhz @xmath114 .",
    "we attempted a model fit to the spectrum using the eg01 model .",
    "the best fit found in the ` lurking ' phase implies that no shock compression is required to produce the relic .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that there has not been any recent dynamical activity in the cluster as also implied by the cooling flow at the center of a1664 @xcite .",
    "the cluster a85 which is also a cooling flow cluster hosts a peripheral relic .",
    "the main difference between a85 and a1664 relics is that the relic in a85 has an extent of @xmath115 kpc whereas a1664 relic has an extent @xmath116 mpc .    the nvss image overlaid on rosat ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) image of a1664",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "the cluster center is to the north of the relic .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness in the cluster center ( chandra image ) is elongated and can be approximated to be an ellipse , the major axis of which is at a p. a. of 25@xmath59 @xcite .",
    "the relic is situated along the same axis toward sw at a distance of 1.13 mpc from the cluster center .",
    "the elongation in x - rays is consistent with the optical major axis of the galaxy at the cluster center and thus the elongation may be due to processes local to the cd or a non relaxed state @xcite . the location of the relic at the outskirts of the cluster and close to a radio source is similar to the relic in coma cluster .",
    "the coma cluster relic is at a distance of 2.2 mpc from the cluster center and is possibly associated with a radio galaxy seen close to the relic ( ensslin et al .",
    "1998 ; eg01 ) .",
    "the cosmological structure formation shocks are believed to be found at cluster peripheries .",
    "these could compress cocoons of radio galaxies leading to the formation of relics and/or could accelerate the particles in the thermal gas to form relics .",
    "the coma relic is elongated and has been proposed to have been compressed by an accretion shock @xcite .",
    "the a1664 relic shows similarity in terms of its location relative to the cluster center to the coma relic , but it is morphologically different and may have a completely different origin .",
    "the relic appears connected to the galaxy a1664@xmath52 in the images .",
    "however , no evidence for jets from the galaxy connecting to the relic has been found .",
    "it is possible that the a1664 relic is a blob of radio emission from the past activity of an agn in the cluster .",
    "deeper x - ray studies in the region of the relic are required to detect if there is a cavity corresponding to the a1664 relic .",
    "the model fit to the spectrum in the eg01 framework and the morphology of the a1664 imply that the relic is a lurking lobe of a radio galaxy .",
    "the relic is about 5 mpc from the center of the cluster a786 in the plane of the sky . in fig .",
    "18 the 345 mhz contours are overlaid on the rosat hri image ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) .",
    "there are two optical galaxies near the brightest central region of the relic , called d and e by @xcite , which have redshifts consistent with that of the cluster a786 .",
    "for this reason the relic has been considered associated with the cluster a786 .",
    "the integrated spectrum of the relic near a786 is curved .",
    "the spectral index between 150 and 606 mhz is @xmath117 and it steepens to a value of @xmath118 between 606 and 1400 mhz . a best fit in ` lurking '",
    "phase was obtained . according to the model",
    "fit the radio galaxy responsible for depositing the relativistic plasma in the icm had been active for @xmath119 yr . the total time elapsed since the jets of the radio galaxy ceased to be active",
    "is @xmath120 yr . within this timescale",
    "the progenitor galaxy would have travelled a distance of 50 kpc with a velocity of 1000 km s@xmath13 ( typical at cluster center ) and 5 kpc with a velocity of 100 km s@xmath13 ( typical velocities in galaxy groups ) . since at a distance of 5 mpc from the cluster center",
    "the velocities of galaxies are low ( similar to galaxy groups ) , it is likely that the progenitor lies within the extent of the relic .",
    "the compact radio source with extended features surrounding it , detected at 4.7 ghz could be the progenitor agn and the relic , a fossil lobe associated with it .",
    "the relic near a786 is one of the largest diffuse emission ( lls@xmath121 mpc ) regions known in the universe .",
    "such large scale filamentary radio emission is rare and has been associated with filaments of galaxies or cluster peripheries ( eg .",
    "zwcl 2341.1 + 0000 , bagchi et al .",
    "2002 and a3376 , bagchi et al .",
    "structure formation shocks are believed to be responsible for such sources . @xcite",
    "have discussed this relic as a candidate for accretion shock compressed relic . however due to lack of information regarding the temperature and velocity dispersion of the cluster a786 , the expected shock radius and polarization could not be determined @xcite .",
    "the spectral index maps of the relic presented here do not show gradients as would be expected in the case of shock acceleration .",
    "also the integrated spectrum of the relic is consistent with that of a ` lurking ' radio galaxy lobe .",
    "thus , it seems that this relic is not a site of cosmological structure formation shock acceleration .",
    "a multi - frequency study of the three radio relics associated with the galaxy clusters , a4038 , a1664 and a786 is presented .",
    "radio images and spectral index maps constructed from those are presented and discussed .",
    "we have used the adiabatic compression model to fit the integrated spectra of the relics .",
    "the 150 , 240 and 606 mhz images of a4038 have revolutionized the picture of the relic known earlier .",
    "new features of the relic are uncovered extending the largest detected linear size of the relic from 56 kpc to 210 kpc .",
    "the newly discovered emission has spectral indices @xmath122 .",
    "the model of radio lobes compressed by shock best fits the integrated spectrum of a4038 relic .",
    "the relic in a1664 was imaged at 150 and 325 mhz with the gmrt .",
    "these images and the nvss image at 1400 mhz were used to construct the integrated spectrum of the relic in a1664 .",
    "a best fit to the integrated spectrum of the relic in a1664 was obtained in the ` lurking ' phase .",
    "the images of the relic near a786 at 150 , 345 , 606 and 1400 mhz were used to construct the integrated spectrum .",
    "the integrated spectrum was best fit in the eg01 framework in the ` lurking ' phase .",
    "a source detected at 4.7 ghz in the central region of the relic that has an optically identified galaxy as a counterpart may be the progenitor of this relic .",
    "the spectral properties of the relic and the detection of a possible progenitor at the center of the relic imply that the relic is an old radio galaxy rather than a site of cosmological shock as considered in earlier studies .",
    "we thank m. johnston - hollitt for suggesting the use of 4.7 ghz data for the a786 relic .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for useful remarks and comments .",
