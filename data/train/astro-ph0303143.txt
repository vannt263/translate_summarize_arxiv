    "the much improved sensitivity of the x - ray satellite _ xmm newton _ is quickly expanding our capability of performing accurate x - ray spectroscopy of accretion powered systems .",
    "in several recent observations of accreting black holes , extremely broadened and redshifted iron k@xmath0 lines have been detected .",
    "wilms et al .",
    "( 2001 ) presented the observations of the nearby seyfert 1 galaxy mcg6 - 30 - 15 in a low - luminosity state and deduced from the iron k@xmath0 line profile that the reprocessing material must be located in the very innermost part of the accretion flow .",
    "similarly , miller et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , found a very broad , skewed fe k@xmath0 emission line in the galactic black hole xte j1650 - 500 in its _ very high _ state . in both cases , not only",
    "is the large observed redshift considered as a signature of a rapidly rotating black hole ( so that the innermost stable orbit is close to the event horizon and the accretion disc can penetrate much deeper in the potential well ) , but also the disc emissivity needs to be strongly peaked towards the inner boundary in order to fit the observed line profile . for simplicity , the disc emissivity is usually assumed to have a power - law profile @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is the distance from the center in units of schwarzschild radii ) , and the index of such power - law is generally assumed to be given by the accretion disc emissivity index in a standard geometrically thin and optically thick disc @xcite . in this case",
    "we expect @xmath3 .",
    "the fact that both wilms et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and miller et al .",
    "( 2002 ) require a larger value of @xmath4 to fit the line profile has prompted speculation that , in the inner disc region , additional energy dissipation must be taking place @xcite .",
    "this might be due to magnetic torque exerted by the accreting material in the plunging region at the inner disc boundary @xcite or to magnetic extraction of the spin energy of the black hole @xcite through magnetic field lines threading the ergosphere and the accretion disc .",
    "such findings have been confirmed by the analysis of a long observation of mcg6 - 30 - 15 with _ xmm - newton _ reported by fabian et al .",
    "these authors found that `` the strong , skewed iron line is clearly detected and is well characterized by a steep emissivity profile within @xmath5 and a flatter profile beyond . ''    here we first make the point that , in the framework of standard , relativistic accretion disc models with zero torque at the inner boundary , the emissivity profile of the hard illuminating x - rays is more centrally peaked than that of the usually assumed standard accretion disc .",
    "this is a general property of the energy deposition rate in a magnetic corona above standard accretion discs .",
    "furthermore , the quality of the x - ray spectroscopic data is such that , using our coronal models , we can start considering the nature of the inner boundary condition for relativistic accretion flows . using a simple analytic formulation , first introduced by agol & krolik ( 2000 ) to include magnetic stresses at the marginally stable orbit in standard disc equations , we can estimate the effect of a modified inner boundary condition on the observed iron line profiles .",
    "in particular , we consider the three following possibilities :    * there is no net torque at the inner boundary ( no - torque case ; nt ) ; * magnetic field lines couple the plunging region to , and exert stress on , the _ cold , geometrically thin disc _ only ( disc - torque ; dt ) ; * magnetic field lines couple the plunging region to the _ vertically extended , magnetically dominated corona _ only ( coronal - thread ; ct ) .    we show that , while in the nt case the coronal emission is more centrally peaked than the disc one ( due to the radial dependence of the fraction of energy dissipated there ) , the effect is greatly enhanced in the ct case , with the strongest deviation from the standard emissivity profile appearing in the innermost coronal region . although the emissivity profiles again become more centrally peaked when the torque is applied directly to the thin disc ( dt ) , the coronal power is much reduced , and we expect the emission to be completely dominated by the quasi - thermal radiation coming from the optically thick disc .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following : in section 2 we solve the fully general relativistic structure equations for standard geometrically thin and optically thick accretion discs , coupled to a magnetically dominated corona ( with the coupling discussed in merloni , 2003 , hereafter m03 ) and opportunely modified by the inclusion of a term describing the additional dissipation from magnetic stresses at the inner boundary either in the disc or in the corona . in such a way we are able to compute the radial profiles of the hard coronal radiation that illuminates the cold disc and is responsible for the fluorescent iron k@xmath0 line production ( section  [ sec_torque ] ) .",
    "then , by means of a simple broken power - law approximation for the coronal emissivity , in section  [ sec_lines ] , we simulate and compare the expected line profiles for the different cases . in section  [ sec_discuss ]",
    "we discuss a number of possible shortcomings of the model we have adopted , and in section  [ sec_conc ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in figure  [ lineallnt ] we show the composite lines we obtain for the nt case for four values of the black hole spin ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the red dashed profiles show the line components produced from the core region , while the black , dot - dashed ones those from the outer regions .",
    "obviously , the higher the black hole spin , the more red - shifted is the core - component , which appear as a small excess at low energies . in figure  [ linealldt ]",
    "we show the profiles derived in the ct case for two values of the parameter @xmath7 .",
    "comparison with the nt case demonstrate that , for @xmath8 , the redshifted core components are substantially weaker and more redshifted ( because @xmath9 is smaller in the dt case , see table  [ tablelines ] ) . for larger @xmath7 , the broad red shoulder produced by the core of the coronal emission becomes more evident , especially for rapidly spinning black holes .",
    "finally , in figure  [ lineallct ] we show the effect of the modified coronal emissivity profile in the case of black hole ",
    "corona connection ( ct ) , for two different values of the power - law index of the radial profile of the extra energy dissipation , @xmath10 . as we expect from the increase of @xmath11 with increasing @xmath7 shown in fig .",
    "[ ratio]b , the strongly redshifted component of the line , associated with the coronal core is more and more prominent .",
    "the line profiles obtained in the ct with an extra efficiency of the order of 0.1 ( and in the dt case for much larger values of @xmath7 ) , are indeed consistent with those observed by _ xmm newton _ in the x - ray spectrum of the seyfert 1 galaxy mcg6 - 30 - 15 @xcite , indicating the possibility that dissipation of rotational energy of the black hole tapped by electromagnetic processes has indeed been observed .",
    "the calculation we have performed clearly demonstrate that the line profiles are more sensitive to energy of the gas in the plunging region ( and/or in the ergosphere ) being magnetically transported and dissipated into the corona rather than into the disc , in the sense that the same amount of extra luminosity ( additional to the bolometric accretion one ) produces much stronger effects in the ct case than in the dt one .",
    "the calculations we have presented in order to include the effects of different inner boundary conditions into observables are obviously oversimplified , and we discuss below the main uncertainties that may affect our conclusions .",
    "first of all , we only considered stationary solutions of the accretion equations .",
    "as clearly demonstrated by a number of simulations @xcite the nature of the accretion flow at the inner boundary is intrinsically time dependent , and the angular momentum transport there , which is mediated by the filaments with the higher relative magnetic field @xcite , can vary strongly on the dynamical timescale .",
    "however the line profiles we aim at modeling are usually derived integrating the observed radiation over many dynamical timescales .",
    "in fact , a direct comparison of time - resolved spectra could shed some light on the complex time variability of the inner accretion flow .",
    "also , we apply a ( generalized ) @xmath0 stress model to describe angular momentum transport , which may be questionable if , as we assume , the mri - driven mhd turbulence saturates due to buoyancy of magnetic flux tubes @xcite .",
    "but our approach is essentially phenomenological , and the work presented here aims at understanding the most important pieces of information hidden in marginal effects on observable physical quantities ( for example , in the iron line profiles ) rather than solve a complex theoretical issue . in this respect ,",
    "the advantage of the simplifying @xmath0 prescription is to allow a relatively straightforward interpretation of the observations .",
    "another reason of uncertainties is the identification of the inner edge of the reflecting cold disc ( the `` reflection edge '' , krolik & hawley 2002 ) with the radius of the marginally stable orbit around the central black hole .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the true reflection edge , i.e. the place where the integrated surface density of the disc has declined enough that the disc becomes effectively transparent , may depend on the accretion rate ( and on the fraction of power released into the corona ) , if magnetic stresses in the inner disc are such that the radial inflow accelerates smoothly inward rather that having a sharp transition at @xmath12 .",
    "numerical simulations of cold , thin , radiative discs at different accretion rates are clearly needed in order to better verify these hypothesis .    finally , contrary to the cases of nt and dt inner boundary conditions , where , for a given small number of assumptions , a full self - consistent analytic model can be solved for the disc ",
    "corona system , the coronal - thread hypothesis is admittedly more speculative : we do not have a specific model for how the energy can be extracted from the black hole and deposited there ( but see discussion at the beginning of section  [ sec_ct ] ) , and we do not take into account the problem of angular momentum transfer in the corona ( our coronae are effectively non accreting ) . once again , given all the theoretical uncertainties , we believe it is more appropriate to adopt the simplest assumption about how the energy extracted from the black hole energizes the corona ( see section  [ sec_ct ] ) and explore its observational consequences .    given all the above uncertainties , it is obvious that all three kinds of boundary condition we have adopted are highly idealized .",
    "none of them is likely to fully describe the physical condition in the innermost part of a turbulent disc surrounded by a magnetically dominated corona .",
    "nonetheless , their predictions for the intensity of the coronal emission compared with the quasi - thermal disc one , for the coronal emissivity profiles and for the shape of the fluorescent iron k@xmath0 lines are qualitatively very different in the three cases and relatively easy to distinguish .",
    "that is what makes the use of such idealized models worthwhile .",
    "in fact , the current observations provides us with enough information to constrain the models .",
    "the shape of the iron line is very sensitive to the coronal emissivity profiles .",
    "both the spin of the black hole ( through the amount of gravitational redshift the line photons suffer ) and the extra efficiency @xmath13 ( through the relative intensity of the red wing of the line , which fixes the emissivity index and size of the core region ) can in principle be measured .",
    "simultaneous multi - wavelength observations can set limits on the relative fraction of coronal versus disc emission , therefore helping discriminate between the ct and dt cases .",
    "the full picture can then emerge after a careful comparison with existing models of all these pieces of informations .",
    "our work demonstrates that detailed spectral analysis of the most broadened and redshifted iron k@xmath0 lines from accreting black holes ( and of their variability ) is a fundamental tool with which to constrain both the geometry of the innermost part of the disc - corona system and the nature of the inner boundary condition of relativistic accretion flows .",
    "the emissivity profile to be considered in analysing the data , to which the line shape is very sensitive , must be that of the illuminating flux , and therefore of _ coronal _ radiation , rather than that of the disc .",
    "when the generation of a magnetically dominated corona is included self - consistently in the relativistic equations for standard accretion discs , the coronal emissivity profiles are usually strongly peaked in the inner part , as far as a portion of the disc is radiation pressure dominated .",
    "the extent of such an inner coronal `` core '' depends crucially on the inner boundary condition .",
    "here we have explored with our calculation three different ( idealized ) prescriptions : a classical no - torque at the inner boundary condition ; a magnetic connection to the plunging region of the _ cold , geometrically thin disc _ only ( disc - torque ) and a magnetic connection to the plunging region of the _ vertically extended , magnetically dominated corona _ only ( coronal - thread ) .",
    "we show that , while in the nt case indeed the coronal emission is more centrally peaked than the disc one , this effect is much enhanced in the ct case , with the strongest deviation from the standard emissivity profile appearing in the innermost coronal region for larger black hole spin and larger amount of energy tapped from the plunging region ( and/or the black hole itself ) . on the other hand , when the torque is applied directly to the thin disc ( dt case ) , although the emissivity profiles may become again more centrally peaked ( for quite large values of @xmath7 ) , the coronal power is much reduced , and we expect the emission to be completely dominated by the quasi - thermal radiation coming from the optically thick disc .    by approximating the exact coronal emissivity profiles with a broken power - law , we have shown how the detailed line profiles are sensitive to the location of the break radius and to the relative normalization of the inner and outer illuminating regions .",
    "these parameters depend strongly on the black hole spin , on the amount of extra energy deposited into the corona , and on the nature of the inner boundary condition itself .",
    "the recently observed extremely broad and skewed fluorescent lines in the x - ray spectra of the seyfert 1 galaxy mcg6 - 30 - 15 @xcite , may therefore be read as an indication that the extraction of energy from spinning black holes is most likely mediated by the magnetic corona rather than by the geometrically thin , optically thick accretion disc .",
