    "it is quite surprising that the existing microscopic justification of the time - honored theory of elasticity , which has been thoroughly researched in a variety of disciplines , is limited to lattice atomic configurations  @xcite .",
    "classical continuum elasticity theory has been applied to a large variety of systems , including granular materials  @xcite . in recent years",
    "the same theory has been applied for the description of elastic properties of micro- and nano - scale systems ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "it is a - priori unclear whether this theory applies at such small scales .",
    "the study presented below shows that the justification of elastic theory based on a ` microscopic ' picture is not entirely straightforward .",
    "in fact , we show that continuum elasticity is limited to sufficiently large scales .",
    "one of the other results presented in this paper is that ` force chains ' in granular systems , which have been attributed by some authors to non - elastic effects  @xcite , are reproduced in simulations of elastic systems , in good agreement with experiments .",
    "below the term ` particles ' is taken to mean grains in a granular system or atoms in a solid .",
    "classical mechanics is assumed throughout this paper . following  @xcite",
    "define , for a system of particles , the coarse grained mass and momentum densities , at the position @xmath0 and time @xmath1 , by and , respectively , where @xmath2 are the positions , velocities and masses of the particles , indexed by @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is a normalized non - negative coarse graining function ( with a single maximum at @xmath5 ) of width @xmath6 , the coarse graining scale .",
    "the velocity field is defined by . upon taking the time derivatives of these coarse grained fields and performing straightforward algebraic manipulations",
    "@xcite one obtains the equation of continuity , as well as the momentum conservation equation : , where greek indices denote cartesian coordinates .",
    "the stress tensor , @xmath7 , is composed of a kinetic contribution , irrelevant for our purposes ( we consider quasi - static deformations ) , and a `` contact '' contribution .",
    "neglecting the former , one obtains : @xmath8.\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the @xmath10-th component of the force exerted on particle @xmath3 by particle @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) at time @xmath1 ( assuming pairwise interactions ) and @xmath13 .      following elementary continuum mechanics , the velocity of a material particle whose initial ( lagrangian ) coordinate is @xmath14 satisfies : , where @xmath15 is the ( lagrangian ) displacement field .",
    "therefore : . using the definitions presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : prelim ] , it follows that : @xmath16 }       { \\sum_{j } m_j \\phi[{{\\bf r}}({{\\bf r}},t')-{{\\bf r}}_j(t')]}dt'.\\ ] ] noting that @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the displacement of particle @xmath3 , and invoking integration by parts in eq .",
    "( [ eq : displacement_la_exact ] ) , one obtains : @xmath19 }       { \\sum_{j } m_j \\phi[{{\\bf r}}-{{\\bf r}}_j(t ) ] } +   \\mbox{``non - linear terms''},\\ ] ] where the result has been translated to the eulerian representation .",
    "the correction terms can be shown to beget non - linear terms in the constitutive relations .",
    "the linear strain is given by .",
    "note that the exact displacement and strain obtained here are different from the commonly defined mean field strain , cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite .",
    "mean field theories are based on the assumption that the relative particle displacements are described by the macroscopic strain , , where @xmath20 .",
    "a suggested improvement is the `` best fit '' strain  @xcite .",
    "these mean field approaches are inaccurate and often lead to incorrect constitutive relations  @xcite .",
    "the microscopic expressions for the stress [ eq .",
    "( [ qs_stress ] ) ] and the strain are not manifestly proportional .",
    "therefore elasticity is not a - priori obvious . to see how it still comes about ,",
    "consider the case of harmonic ( and local ) pairwise particle potentials @xmath21 .",
    "the forces are then given , to linear order in , by .",
    "the stress [ eq .  ( [ qs_stress ] ) ] is then given by , up to nonlinear terms in @xmath22 .",
    "the superscript @xmath23 denotes the reference configuration .",
    "consider a volume @xmath24 which is much larger than the coarse graining scale , @xmath6 , and let @xmath0 be an interior point of @xmath24 which is ` far ' from its boundary .",
    "let upper case latin indices denote the particles in the exterior of @xmath24 which interact with particles inside @xmath24 .",
    "since the considered system is linear , there exists a green s function @xmath25 such that for @xmath26 .",
    "hence , . when all @xmath27 are equal ( rigid translation ) ,",
    ". hence , .",
    "one then obtains , where is a fluctuating displacement .",
    "the sum over @xmath28 in the second term can be shown to be subdominant when the linear size of the volume @xmath24 greatly exceeds the coarse graining scale .",
    "furthermore , to lowest order in a gradient expansion , . substituting this result in @xmath29 , and employing rotational symmetry ,",
    "one obtains : @xmath30 thus linear elasticity is valid when @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "note that the elastic moduli depend , in principle , on the position as well as the resolution ( through the coarse graining function @xmath33 ) .",
    "in order to study the crossover from microelasticity to macroelasticity  @xcite , we have considered a two dimensional ( 2d ) rectangular slab , composed of uniform disks ( of diameter @xmath34 ) whose centers are positioned on a triangular lattice , with nearest neighbors coupled by uniform linear springs ( of rest length @xmath34 ) , and a three dimensional ( 3d ) slab , composed of uniform spheres ( of diameter @xmath34 ) with springs coupling nearest - neighbors ( spring constant @xmath35 ) and next - nearest - neighbors ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "both systems can be shown to correspond to _ isotropic _ elastic media in the continuum limit  @xcite ( for the 3d system , only if @xmath37 ) .",
    "the particles at the bottom layer are attached to a rigid floor , and a downward force is applied to the central particle in the top layer .",
    "this is intended for comparison with 2d  @xcite and 3d  @xcite granular experiments ( even though these models do not directly describe the interaction of granular particles and are primarily intended for studying the crossover between microelasticity and macroelasticity , they closely reproduce some of the experimental results ) . fig .",
    "[ fig : crossover ] presents a comparison between the vertical stress exerted on the floor of the system for different slab heights ( numbers of layers of particles ) and continuum elastic solutions , for both systems ( @xmath37 for the 3d system ) . the convergence to the appropriate ( rough rigid support )",
    "elastic stress distribution for a sufficient number of layers is evident .       a more realistic model with unilateral ( `` one - sided '' ) springs , active only upon compression , yields results which are even closer to the experiments  @xcite .",
    "in this case , some of the springs are disconnected ( as obtained in  @xcite for a pile geometry ) when the external force is applied . in particular , the horizontal springs in a triangular region below the point of application of the force are severed , and the corresponding macroscopic properties are anisotropic .",
    "the resulting stress distribution  @xcite is similar to that predicted by hyperbolic models of force propagation  @xcite , but it is a result of an elastic model .",
