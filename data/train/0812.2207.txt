    "when ( linearly ) polarized electromagnetic radiation propagates in a diamagnetic material , the polarization plane of the wave changes by an angle @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the verdet constant , @xmath9 characterizes the magnetic field intensity along the direction of propagation of the electromagnetic radiation of wavelength @xmath10 ; @xmath11 is the distance travelled by the wave within the medium .",
    "the verdet constant @xmath8 not only depends upon the wavelength but also on the specifics of the given material such as , for instance , the temperature and the charge concentration . in electromagnetic plasmas ,",
    "the kinetic energy of the charge carriers dominates against the potential energy , and the verdet constant can be computed in simple terms : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the electron mass , @xmath14 is the charge concentration of the electrons and the integral allows for the spatial variation of the magnetic field intensity as well as of the charge concentration . equation ( [ plasma ] ) holds under two physical assumptions ( see , e.g. @xcite ) :    * the plasma is globally neutral , i.e. the charge concentrations of the electrons and of the ions are balanced , i.e. @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 denotes generically the common value of @xmath14 and @xmath17 ) ; * the plasma is cold , i.e. the kinetic temperature of the electrons and of the ions is always much smaller than the corresponding masses .",
    "since the plasma is cold ( i.e. non - relativistic ) and globally neutral the values of the plasma and larmor frequencies for the electrons are always smaller than the corresponding quantities but computed for the ions : this is why , in eq .",
    "( [ plasma ] ) only the electron mass and the electron concentration appears . in the case of a tokamak eq .",
    "( [ plasma ] ) is often used to determine the charge concentration @xmath14 .",
    "linearly polarized electromagnetic radiation can be sent through the tokamak and the @xmath18 can be directly measured , for instance , as a function of the frequency of the incident radiation .",
    "the latter experimental information is sufficient to determine , at least approximately , the electron concentration @xmath14 since the geometry and intensity of the magnetic field are known from the design of the instrument .    given the profile of the electron concentration it is relevant , in diverse circumstances , to assess the magnetic field intensity .",
    "this is , in a nutshell , one of the objectives of cosmic polarimetry : the polarization properties of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb in what follows ) are exploited as a diagnostic for the existence of large - scale magnetic fields .",
    "the polarization observable of the radiation field are customarily parametrized in terms of the stokes parameters @xcite whose evolution can be written in a schematic form which is closely analog to the set of equations often employed to describe the propagation of polarized radiation through stellar atmospheres",
    "@xcite : @xmath19 where    * @xmath20 is the differential optical depth of the system ( mainly due , in the cmb case , to photon - electron scattering ) and @xmath21 is the faraday rotation rate , i.e. @xmath22 ; * @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the source terms for the intensity and for the polarization ; * within the present notations , the ( rotationally invariant ) @xmath25 and @xmath26 stokes parameters describe , respectively , the intensity of the radiation field and the circular polarization ; the @xmath27 and @xmath28 stokes parameters are not rotationally invariant and are both sensitive to the linear polarization .",
    "furthermore , according to the standard conventions , we also have : @xmath29 equations ( [ heat1])([heat3 ] ) are the flat - space analog of the evolution equations studied in the present paper . in eqs .",
    "( [ heat1 ] ) , ( [ heat2 ] ) and ( [ heat3 ] ) the convective derivative with respect to @xmath30 is actually a total derivative with respect to the cosmic time coordinate which receives contribution also from the fluctuations of the geometry .    the large - scale fluctuations of the geometry induce computable inhomogeneities on the stokes parameters and they will be denoted , respectively , as and @xmath31 .",
    "the notation @xmath32 will be adopted . ]",
    "@xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the experimental observations on the properties of the cmb polarization are expressed not in terms of @xmath34 and @xmath35 but rather in terms of the corresponding e - mode and b - mode polarizations .",
    "the rationale for this common practice stems directly from the observation that the brightness perturbations of the stokes parameters sensitive to linear polarization ( i.e. @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) are not invariant under rotations on a plane orthogonal @xmath36 . consequently , their orthogonal combinations @xmath37 transform , respectively , as fluctuations of spin - weight @xmath38 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . owing to this observation , @xmath39 can be expanded in terms of spin-@xmath40 spherical harmonics @xmath41 , i.e. @xmath42 the e- and b - modes are , up to a sign , the real and the imaginary parts of @xmath43 , i.e. @xmath44 in real space ( as opposed to fourier space ) , the fluctuations constructed from @xmath45 and @xmath46 have the property of being invariant under rotations on a plane orthogonal to @xmath36 . they can therefore be expanded in terms of ( ordinary ) spherical harmonics : @xmath47 where @xmath48 . under parity inversion @xmath49 while @xmath50 .",
    "the ee and bb angular power spectra are then defined as @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes the ensemble average . in the minimal version of the @xmath0cdm paradigm the adiabatic fluctuations of the scalar curvature lead to a polarization which is characterized exactly by the condition @xmath53 , i.e. @xmath54 . in more general situations also",
    "the cross - correlations of the various modes can be defined in full terms .",
    "having introduced the appropriate rotationally invariant observables , the empirical observations can now be quickly summarized , in a bulleted form , as :    * the te and the ee angular power spectra have been measured so far by various experiments with different accuracies ; * direct measurements of the bb angular power spectra led just upper limits on the b - mode polarization since the observations are consistent with the null result ; * the polarization power spectra detected by different experiments are consistent .",
    ".the main polarization experiments , their typical frequencies , their salient observations are illustrated in the light of the polarization properties of the cmb . in the last column @xmath55 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the @xmath56 - parameter space is explored using a grid of @xmath57 points . in the following the contour plots for 68% and 95% confidence level",
    "are presented for different data sets .",
    "since the instruments operate at different frequency channels , however , the data are usually those for combined frequency channels , it seems useful to assign effective frequencies to each of the experiments .",
    "following @xcite an effective frequency @xmath58 can be defined by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the frequency spectrum of the signal , and @xmath61 is the frequency response profile of the detector .",
    "the polarization signal is determined by @xmath62 which is proportional to @xmath63 , so that the spectrum of the signal is given by @xmath64 there are different options for the detector response function . for a flat bandpass filter with sharp cut - offs at some frequencies @xmath65 and @xmath66 the effective frequency",
    "is given by @xmath67 .",
    "applying this to the dasi and cbi experiments gives in both cases @xmath68 ghz .",
    "assuming that the detector response function is modelled by a @xmath69 function at the relevant frequencies it is found that the effective frequency is given by @xmath70 , which in the case of quad results in @xmath71 ghz and the q+v data of wmap in @xmath72 ghz . for capmap combining the two detector response functions an effective frequency of @xmath73 ghz is found .",
    "we are now ready to discuss the main results of this analysis . in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] results are presented for wmap 5 .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath74 corresponds to @xmath75 ng and @xmath76 which corresponds to a magnetic field strength @xmath77 ng .",
    "furthermore , @xmath78 and there are @xmath79 data points . in fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] the results are presented for the quad data which consist of 23 data points .",
    "it is found that the bestfit model has @xmath80 and corresponds to the magnetic field parameters @xmath81 ng , @xmath82 .",
    "this implies a magnetic field strength @xmath83 ng . by comparing fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] and [ figure6 ] it seems that the quad data lead to systematically larger values of the magnetic fields . at the same time , by admission of the quad team , the bb angular power spectra might not be free of systematics .",
    "indeed , the argument used by the quad team seems to be , in short , the following ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if quad would have seen bb power at a level greater than in the @xmath0cdm , extensive investigations would have been required to check if the result was indeed free of systematics .",
    "since the collaboration did not see any excess in the bb power ,  further investigation of mixings systematics is arguably unnecessary \" ( verbatim from @xcite ) .",
    "the caveat is that , in the present case , the putative signal is larger than in the @xmath0cdm case and , probably , further checks on the systematics may resolve the problem .",
    "the results for the combined data sets of capmap , dasi , cbi and boomerang b03 are presented in fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] . in total",
    "there are 24 data points .",
    "the bestfit model is characterized by @xmath84 and the magnetic field parameters , @xmath85 ng and @xmath86 .",
    "this results in a magnetic field strength @xmath87 ng . concerning the results expressed by figs .",
    "[ figure6 ] , [ figure7 ] and [ figure8 ] few comments are in order . in all cases the relevant statistical indicator , for the present analysis , is the @xmath88 , i.e. @xmath89 .",
    "we do not judge here the compatibility of a model with the data by performing the pearson @xmath74 test .",
    "in summary , the b - mode due to faraday rotation has been calculated both semi - analytically and numerically .",
    "the parameter space of the magnetized background has been investigated by enforcing the upper limits on the b - mode polarization and also by performing a dedicated @xmath74 analysis .",
    "the two analyses led to compatible results .",
    "it has been shown that forthcoming experiments aiming at a direct detection of a b - mode polarization arising from a putative tensor power spectrum can also be able to cut through the parameter space of a magnetized background .",
    "an interesting byproduct of the present analysis has been an analytic scrutiny of the faraday induced b - mode at small angular scales . in the small - scale limit",
    "the b - mode autocorrelations can be computed with reasonable accuracy by contracting ( in the inn - wigner sense ) the relevant matrix elements of the rotation group .",
    "the latter results have been cross - checked by direct numerical calculations .",
