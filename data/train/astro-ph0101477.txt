    "the carbon star phenomenon , i.e. , the presence of stars for which the abundance of carbon exceeds that of oxygen in the atmospheres , occurs during the final evolutionary stage of low to intermediate mass stars ( @xmath11@xmath810m@xmath4 ; wallerstein & knapp 1998 ) , and it is believed to be due to a dredge - up process driven by quasi - periodic he - shell flashes ( straniero et al .",
    "these stars , located on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , lose copious amounts of matter ( @xmath110@xmath9@xmath810@xmath10m@xmath4yr@xmath5 ) in an intense stellar wind .",
    "in fact , it is the mass loss that determines the agb lifetime and not the nuclear burning processes .",
    "hence , a determination of the mass loss characteristics , i.e. , the dependence on time , mass , chemistry , metallicity , etc .",
    ", is of utmost importance for our understanding of late stellar evolution .",
    "the mass loss creates a circumstellar envelope ( cse ) of gas and dust around the star .",
    "the low temperature of the central star allows the formation of a wide variety of molecular species in its atmosphere , and the expanding gas is therefore mainly in molecular form .",
    "the chemistry in the cse itself can be very rich , and it depends on the c / o - ratio , the thickness of the envelope , and the strength of the ambient ultraviolet radiation field .",
    "presently , @xmath160 different molecular species have been identified in cses around agb - stars ( olofsson 1997 ) .",
    "the study of agb - cses is important for the understanding of the late stages of stellar evolution as mentioned above .",
    "in addition , an understanding of the atmospheric and circumstellar chemistry is required to determine the elemental abundances in these winds , which contribute to the chemical evolution of the interstellar medium ( busso et  al .",
    "finally , since agb stars are the progenitors of planetary nebulae ( pne ) , the cses are very likely important ingredients in the formation of pne ( kwok 1993 ) .    observations of molecular millimetre - wave line emission have proven to be one of the best tools for studying the structure , kinematics , and chemistry of the cses , and co and oh observations have proven particularly useful for the determination of accurate mass loss rates [ see olofsson @xcite and references therein ] .",
    "while the overall picture of mass loss on the agb is fairly well understood , some of the underlying physical principles are not .",
    "the prevailing theory , which needs to be thoroughly tested observationally , is that the mass loss occurs in a two stage process .",
    "first the pulsations of the star deposit energy in the atmosphere , leading to a considerably increased scale height , and sufficient matter at low enough temperatures for efficient dust formation .",
    "radiation pressure on the dust grains accelerate the dust wind to its terminal expansion velocity in the second stage .",
    "the gas is momentum coupled , through collisions , to the dust , and it will be effectively dragged along .",
    "the mechanisms that cause the mass loss to vary on a wide range of time scales still need to be pinpointed . eventually , the possibility of mass ejected in clumps has to be addressed , although in this paper we will consider only a smooth spherically symmetric wind .",
    "this study of an essentially complete sample of visually bright , relatively unobscured carbon stars will hopefully increase our knowledge of the modelling of circumstellar molecular radio line emission , the mass loss characteristics , the circumstellar chemistry , the elemental abundances in the winds , and possibly the evolutionary status of these objects .",
    "it will also provide us with the tools required to determine the properties of higher mass loss rate objects , for which the central star may be completely obscured .    in this paper the basic physical characteristics of the cses ,",
    "e.g. , the stellar mass loss rate , the gas kinetic temperature , and the gas expansion velocity , are determined using a radiative transfer analysis of the observed @xmath11co ( hereafter co ) millimetre - wave line emission .",
    "the co molecule is particularly well suited for this purpose , since it is difficult to photodissociate and easy to excite through collisions , and thus is a very good tracer of the molecular gas density and temperature .",
    "furthermore , the molecular excitation is of a quasi - thermal nature which simplifies detailed modelling .",
    "we have selected a sample of 68 bright n- and j - type carbon stars for which circumstellar co emission was detected by olofsson et  al .",
    "( 1993a ) . their original sample consisted of carbon stars brighter than @xmath12@xmath132mag . ,",
    "in total 120 sources . the detection rate for all the carbon stars searched for circumstellar co was as high as 72% .",
    "the original sample is thought to be close to complete to distances below 1kpc [ it is estimated that about a third of the carbon stars within this distance are missing , presumably the ones with thick and dusty cses , i.e. , the high mass loss objects ( olofsson et  al . 1993a ) ] , and for distances below 500pc all sources ( a total of 41 ) were detected in co ( note that the distances used in this paper are generally lower than those adopted in olofsson et  al.1993a ) .",
    "these facts taken together led to the conclusion that the great majority of all n - type carbon stars are losing mass at a rate higher than about 10@xmath9m@xmath4yr@xmath5 .",
    "they do not , however , constitute a homogeneous group in terms of circumstellar properties .",
    "instead they show a wide range of gas expansion velocities and mass loss rates , presumably due to differences in mass , evolutionary stage , etc .. in addition , the reasonably well studied , high mass loss rate carbon star , lp and ( also known as irc+40540 ) , is included in our analysis , since it provides a good test case for the radiative transfer model .    the co ( @xmath14@xmath13@xmath15@xmath16@xmath17 and @xmath14@xmath13@xmath18@xmath16@xmath15 ) observations presented in olofsson et  al .",

    "in order to model the circumstellar molecular line emission and to derive the basic characteristics of the cses we have developed a non - lte radiative transfer code based on the monte carlo method [ bernes @xcite ; see also schier @xcite , for details ] .",
    "an accurate treatment of the molecular excitation is needed for a correct description of the radiative transfer in an expanding circumstellar envelope , e.g. , the sobolev approximation has been shown to introduce significant errors in these circumstances ( e.g. , schnberg 1985 ) .",
    "the monte carlo method is well suited for the study of cses , since it is very flexible and close to the physics and yet simple in principle .",

    "is obtained by simulating the line photons using a number of model photons , each representing a large number of real photons from all transitions considered .",
    "these model photons , emitted both locally in the gas as well as injected from the boundaries of the cse , are followed through the cse and the number of absorptions are calculated and stored .",
    "photons are spontaneously emitted in the gas with complete angular and frequency redistribution ( crd ) , i.e. , the local emission is assumed to be isotropic and the scattering are assumed to be incoherent .",
    "the weight of a model photon is continuously modified , to take the absorptions and stimulated emissions into account , as it travels through the cse . when all model photons are absorbed in , or have escaped , the cse the se are solved and the whole process is then repeated until some criterion for convergence is fulfilled . once the molecular excitation , i.e. , the level populations , is obtained the radiative transfer equation can be solved exactly .",
    "the main drawback of the monte carlo method is its slow convergence ( @xmath1@xmath44 ) .",
    "this is , however , usually outweighed by its great adaptability .",
    "one of our motivations for choosing the monte carlo method was to be able to treat varying mass loss rates , departures from spherical symmetry , and the possibility of a highly clumped medium .",
    "these complicating issues will be investigated in a future version of our monte carlo code .",
    "the numerical modelling of line emission from cses , where intricate interplays between physical and chemical processes take place , is a challenge .",
    "this applies , in particular , to the important inner regions of the cse model , where very few observational constraints are available and our knowledge is very limited . in this analysis",
    ", we will neglect many of these complexities and assume a relatively simple , yet reasonably realistic , cse model . by applying the model to a large sample",
    "we will derive fairly reliable mass loss rates , and we will also be able to pick out objects for which there appears to be clear deviations from the simple picture .    in what will be referred to as `` the standard model '' we assume a spherically symmetric cse that expands at a constant velocity . in our data",
    "we see no evidence for gas acceleration in the co emitting region . the cse is divided into a number of discrete shells , each with its own set of physical parameters describing the state of the molecular gas .",
    "the density structure ( as a function of distance , @xmath45 , from the central star ) can then be derived from the conservation of mass @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the hydrogen gas mass loss rate , and @xmath48 is the gas expansion velocity taken from the line profile fits of olofsson et  al .",

    "the observations of this transition are complicated by possible contamination by interstellar lines , and the signal - to - noise ratio is not particularly good , erasing any possible signs of maser action . as expected the radiation emitted by the central star plays an important role in the excitation .",

    "the sucessful modelling of the vast majority of our sample stars , assuming a spherically symmetric cse , suggests that axi- or non - symmetric mass loss is not a common phenomenon among these optically bright carbon stars . however , in the case of and , stars with complex radio line profiles , the possibility of bipolar outflows has been considered ( heske et  al .  1989 ; kahane et  al .",
    "due to the complexity of these outflows , no radiative transfer analysis was attempted here .",
    "kahane et  al .",
    "@xcite suggest that , in addition to the high velocity bipolar outflow , has a slowly expanding spherical component .",
    "using a 2d radiative transfer code , based upon the sobolev approximation , they derive a total mass loss rate of @xmath11.5@xmath210@xmath95m@xmath117yr@xmath5 for this object .",
    "the authors further suggest that is a transition object , between carbon stars and pne , having just developed a highly axi - symmetric mass loss .",

    "this , in addition to the small dynamical age of the envelope , suggests that has entered its `` superwind '' phase .",

    "1993a ) depending on the transition and the telescope used .",
    "heske et  al .",
    "@xcite , mapped the circumstellar co line emission around this object , and interpreted the observed asymmetries as being produced either by a bipolar outflow or a highly clumped wind .",

    "it might be in a state similar to that of .",

    "indeed , kerschbaum @xcite suggests that this might be a detached shell source based upon his modelling of the sed of this object .",
    "however , the co single dish observations reveal no signs of double - peaked profiles ( confusion with interstellar lines complicates the interpretation ) , which are indicative of a detached co shell .",
    "moreover , has a relatively low @xmath11c/@xmath104c - ratio of 6 ( abia & isern 1997 ) .",
    "thus , it resembles the j - type stars .    attempting to model this source with a standard model of its cse fails to explain both the observed @xmath14@xmath13@xmath15@xmath16@xmath17 and @xmath14@xmath13@xmath18@xmath16@xmath15 line intensities in that they come out too weak , by more than a factor of two .",
    "this is due to the extremely cold envelope , resulting from the adopted @xmath70-parameter of 0.2 ( due to the luminosity being lower than 6000l@xmath117 ) , in combination with a relatively high mass loss rate @xmath12@xmath210@xmath95m@xmath117yr@xmath5 required to maximize the line intensities . further increasing",
    "the mass loss rate will make the envelope even cooler due to the increase in co line cooling . if one instead assigns an @xmath70-parameter of @xmath11 it is possible to obtain a reasonable fit to the data using a mass loss rate of @xmath15@xmath210@xmath95m@xmath117yr@xmath5 .",
    "this estimate must be regarded as highly uncertain .",
    "fig .  [ distr_all ] shows the distribution of the mass loss rates obtained from the radiative transfer model for all sources ( also shown is the distribution for the stars within 500pc of the sun ) , as well as divided into variability groups ( note that objects with known detached shells have not been included in this analysis ) .",
    "since the statistics of the sra stars are poor we have chosen to group them together with the srb stars .",
    "the mass loss rate distribution for all stars is sharply peaked around the median mass loss rate of 2.8@xmath210@xmath7m@xmath4yr@xmath5 ( the median mass loss rate for the stars within 500pc of the sun is 1.6@xmath210@xmath7m@xmath4yr@xmath5 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that this is roughly the rate at which the core mass is expected to grow due to nuclear burning ( schnberner 1983 ) .",
    "mira variables generally have larger mass loss rates than other variability types , while irregular variables and semiregulars appear to have very similar mass loss rate characteristics .",
    "based on the mass loss rate distribution for the sample of stars within 500pc , which we believe to be close to complete and for which we have detected all sources , we are able to draw some general conclusions .",
    "the sharp decline at mass loss rates below @xmath15@xmath210@xmath9m@xmath117yr@xmath5 is very likely real .",
    "netzer & elitzur @xcite estimate that a mass loss rate in excess of @xmath110@xmath7m@xmath4yr@xmath5 is required to get a dust - driven wind .",
    "the exact limit is , however , sensitive to the adopted stellar and dust parameters .",
    "the drastically decreasing number of high mass loss rate objects is also real , although our selection criterion bias against these objects , and can be explained by the fact that carbon stars of the type discussed here , i.e. , mainly low mass ones ( claussen et  al .",
    "1987 ) , only for a limited time , or possibly never , reach high mass loss rates .",
    "the @xmath38-distribution for this sample of stars has already been shown and discussed by olofsson et al .",
    "@xcite . however , a new comparison between the mass loss characteristics @xmath47 and @xmath38 is warranted considering the more reliable mass loss rates obtained in this paper , fig .",
    "[ mdot - ve ] .",
    "we find a clear trend that @xmath38 increases with @xmath47 , @xmath38@xmath115@xmath134 ( with a correlation coefficient of 0.78 ) . in comparison ,",
    "olofsson et  al .",
    "@xcite derived @xmath38@xmath115@xmath135 , but their mass loss rates were calibrated using eq .  [ mdot_simple ] , which includes a @xmath136-dependence .",
    "the correlation is much tighter than that obtained by olofsson el al .",
    "@xcite , which is reassuring .",
    "thus , the mass loss mechanism operates such that mass loss rate and expansion velocity increase together .",
    "however , the scatter appears larger than the uncertainties in the estimates , and so the mechanism also produces widely different mass loss rates for a given expansion velocity . at high mass loss rates the scatter is larger with a possible divison into objects with high mass loss rates but only moderately high velocities , and objects with moderately high mass loss rates but high velocities .",
    "we note also that for the detached shell sources the mass loss rates and expansion velocities for the two mass loss epochs follow the general trend .    habing et  al .",
    "@xcite studied the momentum transfer from the photons , via the dust , to the gas in the cses of agb stars .",
    "they found that for mass loss rates close to the minimum mass loss rate for a dust - driven wind , @xmath13@xmath210@xmath9m@xmath4yr@xmath5 , @xmath38 increases linearly with @xmath47 , while for mass loss rates above @xmath110@xmath95m@xmath4yr@xmath5 the dependence weakens considerably . at 10@xmath6m@xmath4yr@xmath5",

    "habing et al .",

    "this can explain the observed behaviour in fig .",
    "[ mdot - ve ] for mass loss rates below about 10@xmath95m@xmath4yr@xmath5 , but for the higher mass loss rates it appears that a dependence of @xmath38 ( and @xmath47 ) on luminosity gives the most reasonable explanation , see sect .  [",
    "s : stellarprop ] .      in fig .",
    "[ mdot - stellar ] we plot the circumstellar characteristics , @xmath47 and @xmath38 , against the stellar characteristics luminosity ( @xmath58 ) , period ( @xmath138 ) , effective temperature ( @xmath139 ) , and the photospheric c / o - ratio .",
    "the effective temperatures and c / o - ratios used in this analysis are those presented in olofsson et  al .",
    "we have looked for dependences assuming that the ordinate scales as the abscissa to the power of @xmath140 , and a normal correlation coefficient @xmath45 was calculated as an estimate of the quality of the fit , see fig .",
    "[ mdot - stellar ] .",
    "the uncertainties in the estimated quantities are of the order : @xmath3650% ( @xmath47 ) , @xmath362kms@xmath5 ( @xmath38 ) , @xmath3610% ( @xmath138 ; but some periods may be poorly determined ) , a factor of 2 ( @xmath58 ) , and @xmath36200k ( @xmath139 ) .    clearly , both the mass loss rate and the expansion velocity increase with the pulsation period of the star .",
    "there is a weaker trend with the luminosity of the star .",
    "the latter dependence is not completely independent of the former , since some of the luminosities are estimated from a @xmath141 relation .",
    "the existence of a @xmath141 relation is usually attributed to a distribution in mass ( jones et al .",
    "1994 ) , i.e. , the higher the mass the longer the period and the higher the luminosity .",
    "when looked at in detail , at least the apparent mass loss rate dependence on period may be attributed to a change from semiregular pulsation at short periods to regular pulsations at longer periods .",
    "we may therefore infer that for the mass lass rate it is not clear whether it is the regularity of the pulsation or the luminosity that causes the increase with period . for the expansion velocity",
    "the increase with period may be a combined effect of increasing mass loss rate with period ( for low mass loss rates ) and an increase in luminosity for the longer periods , e.g. , habing et  al . @xcite",
    "derive @xmath48@xmath115@xmath142 in their dust - driven wind model .",
    "in addition , there is evidence of a weak trend in the sense that higher mass loss rate objects have lower effective temperatures .",
    "these correlations are all consistent with a dust - driven wind , where the pulsation may play an important role .",
    "there appears to be no correlation between the mass loss rate and the c / o - ratio , which is surprising considering that the dust - to - gas mass ratio in a c - rich cse should be sensitively dependent on this .",
    "the present mass loss rates for the detached shell sources are typical for their periods but somewhat low for their luminosities .",
    "however , during the formation of the dcses the mass loss rate must have been atypically high for the present periods and luminosities .",
    "we also find that the expansion velocities of the dcses lie at the very high end of expansion velocities found for other stars with the same luminosity , indicating that these stars had higher luminosities during the shell ejection .    two other stars , and , stand out in these plots .",

    "carbon stars on the agb are important in returning processed gas to the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",

    "@xcite the infrared carbon stars have a roughly constant surface density out to the galactocentric distance of the sun , after which it follows an exponential decline with a scale length of @xmath12.5kpc .",

    "our estimate of the rate at which matter is returned to the ism by carbon stars is consistent with previous estimates ( considering the large uncertainties ) , e.g. , knapp & morris @xcite and jura & kleinmann @xcite derive values of @xmath12@xmath210@xmath146m@xmath4yr@xmath5pc@xmath147 and @xmath11.5@xmath210@xmath146m@xmath4yr@xmath5pc@xmath147 , respectively .",

    "this corroborates the conclusions by gustafsson et  al .",
    "@xcite that ` normal ' carbon stars are not important for the total carbon budget of the galaxy .",
    "according to these authors the main contributors should instead be high mass stars in the wolf - rayet stage , annually supplying the galaxy with @xmath10.01m@xmath4 of carbon .",
    "this is roughly what is required to produce the @xmath110@xmath85@xmath210@xmath148m@xmath4 of carbon present in the milky way over a period of 10@xmath149 years .",
    "we have developed a detailed radiative transfer code to model circumstellar molecular line emission .",
    "the code also solves for the energy balance equation of the gas .",
    "it is found that the mass loss rate determination for low mass loss rate objects depends crucially on a number of assumptions in the cse model , except on the dust properties , since the co molecules are radiatively excited . on the other hand ,",
    "the mass loss rate estimate for a high mass loss rate object depends essentially only on the temperature structure , and hence the uncertain dust parameters .",
    "in addition , for such an object the co emission saturates , and becomes less useful as a mass loss rate measure .",
    "we also find that different lines respond differently to changes in the various parameters .",

    "the fact that the model can be succesfully applied over such a wide range of environments gives us confidence in the results , even though we are aware of the fact that some assumptions are poorly constrained . the large majority of the stars have mass loss rates in a narrow range centered at @xmath13@xmath210@xmath7m@xmath4yr@xmath5 , and it appears that very few agb carbon stars * ( @xmath1285% ) * lose matter at a rate less than @xmath15@xmath210@xmath9m@xmath4yr@xmath5 .",
    "we find that the mass loss rate and the gas expansion velocity are relatively well correlated , but the scatter is large enough that we may conclude that the mass loss mechanism is able to produce a wide range of mass loss rates for a given expansion velocity .",

    "we conclude that the mass loss rate increases with increased regular pulsation and/or luminosity , and that the expansion velocity increases with mass loss rate ( for low mass loss rates ) and luminosity .",
    "the observed trends are all supporting the common concensus that these winds are driven by radiation pressure on dust grains , and that pulsation may play an important role .",
    "somewhat surprising there appears to be no dependence on the stellar c / o - ratio .    our standard cse model , assuming a single smooth expanding wind produced by a continuous mass loss , fails to reproduce the observational data for about 10% of the sample stars .",
    "most notable among these are five stars with detached cses , presumably formed during a period of highly increased mass loss , and low present mass loss rates .",
    "we have found indications that the present mass loss rate is significantly higher for the star with the youngest dcse , and that the shell mass may increase with shell age .",

    "this result can be interpreted as a dust - to - gas mass ratio which increases with mass loss rate , but changes in the dust properties may also play a role .",
    "we also find that this means that the gas kinetic temperature in a carbon star cse depends only weakly on the mass loss rate .",
    "the size of the co envelope is an important parameter in the mass loss rate determination , at least for the low mass loss rate objects .",
    "we have used published radial co(@xmath14@xmath13@xmath15@xmath16@xmath17 ) brightness distributions , in combination with the radiative transfer code , to show that the co photodissociation calculation by mamon et  al .",
    "@xcite gives reasonably accurate results .",
    "in a few cases the observed radial brightness distributions are clearly different than the model results , suggesting deviations from a simple @xmath0 density law , and hence time - variable mass loss .",
