    "<S> such constant terms can not contribute to the overall amplitude for a physical polarization @xmath65 of the @xmath1 boson . </S>",

    "<S> this is much smaller than the previous rough estimate@xcite by many orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> more likely , the signal of @xmath0 comes from the higgs mediated process . since one requires the scalar boson @xmath9 to be light enough </S>",
    "<S> ( such as 90 gev ) in order to get a large branching ratio , one may also consider the alternative production of @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> this possibility is already covered in some of the higgs search analysis@xcite .    as the accumulated events of @xmath71 among the four lep groups have reached @xmath72 , </S>",
    "<S> a branching ratio of @xmath2 is potentially detectable . </S>",
    "<S> the main difficulty seems to be finding a clear signal with high efficiency for such events . </S>",
    "<S> if the pseudoscalar boson is heavier than @xmath73 gev , then presumably it will decay dominantly into six @xmath15 quarks . in mssm@xcite , for bosons decay into @xmath74 about @xmath75 of the time and about @xmath76 into @xmath77 .    </S>",
    "<S> for the case 10 gev @xmath78 gev , the @xmath8 boson can decay dominantly into six @xmath79 leptons or six charm quarks . </S>",
    "<S> the two modes are competitive with each other . </S>",
    "<S> one can search for @xmath77 plus four jets or @xmath80 plus two jets or @xmath81 in increasing detection efficiencies . </S>",
    "<S> the answer will depend on the relative fraction between @xmath77 and @xmath82 final states .    </S>",
    "<S> for the channel @xmath83 , the clear signal can be a number of @xmath15-tagged jets . </S>",
    "<S> similar signal was searched before in the previous higgs search analysis @xcite for lighter on - shell scalar boson @xmath9 using the same @xmath17 final state . </S>",
    "<S> it was concluded@xcite that the current limit of this branching ratio is at about @xmath84 level . </S>",
    "<S> with more recent data , this limit may be improved by a factor of @xmath85 or more with improved statistics . to improve this further </S>",
    "<S> , one probably has to increase the efficiency in the identification of six jets from the three @xmath8 bosons and the efficiency in b - tagging . </S>",
    "<S> typically a prize ( of about @xmath86 ) has to be paid to impose tight cut to reject 3 , 4 or 5 jets events </S>",
    "<S> . the efficiency will be higher for lighter pseudoscalar . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , one has to pay a prize for b - tagging . </S>",
    "<S> the current b - tagging efficiency of lep detectors is roughly about @xmath87 per jet . </S>",
    "<S> even if one tags only 3 out of 6 jets , the prize is already quite severe ( @xmath88 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these two effects combine to give @xmath89 efficiency of identifying @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> ( opal@xcite quoted @xmath91 , but with rather high background ) .    in a general multi - doublet extension of standard model , </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that the pseudoscalar decays into @xmath79 leptons or @xmath15 quarks with similar branching fraction , in that case , the best modes to discover pseudoscalar boson may be @xmath92 or @xmath93 final states.@xcite as far as we know , these modes have not been seriously searched for by lep yet .    </S>",
    "<S> our analysis indicates that there is a good chance that one can detect signal of pseudoscalar boson in @xmath1 decay with a branching ratio of about @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> it is certainly far from trivial ; however , the reward is that the pseudoscalar boson may be already there in the data waiting to be uncovered . </S>"
