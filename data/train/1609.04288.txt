    "the non - hopfian property of finitely generated groups has a close connection with the non - residual finiteness .",
    "in fact , the classical work due to malcev  @xcite shows that every finitely generated non - hopfian group is non - residually finite .",
    "one of the hardest open problems about hyperbolic groups is whether or not every hyperbolic group is residually finite .",
    "an important progress on this problem was given by sela  @xcite asserting that every torsion - free hyperbolic group is hopfian . in 2007 , osin  @xcite proved that this problem is equivalent to the question on whether or not a group @xmath11 is residually finite if @xmath11 is hyperbolic relative to a finite collection of residually finite subgroups .",
    "the notion of relatively hyperbolic groups is an important generalization of hyperbolic groups in geometric group theory originally introduced by gromov @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "motivating examples for this generalization include the fundamental groups of non - compact hyperbolic manifolds of finite volume .",
    "in particular , every @xmath0-bridge link complement except for a torus link is a hyperbolic manifold with cusps , so its fundamental group , that is , the @xmath0-bridge link group , is hyperbolic relative to its peripheral subgroups although it is not a hyperbolic group .",
    "it is known by groves  @xcite that a finitely generated torsion - free group is hopfian , if it is hyperbolic relative to free abelian subgroups .",
    "it is also proved by reinfeldt and weidmann  @xcite that every hyperbolic group , possibly with torsion , is hopfian .",
    "in addition , based on this result , coulon and guirardel  @xcite proved that every lacunary hyperbolic group , which is characterized as a direct limit of hyperbolic groups with a certain radii condition , is also hopfian .    as for small cancellation groups , it is known that if a group has a finite presentation which satisfies small cancellation conditions either @xmath13 or both @xmath14 and @xmath5 , then it is hyperbolic ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "wise  @xcite also proved that every finite @xmath13-small cancellation presentation defines a residually finite group .",
    "historically , not many have been known examples of finitely generated non - hopfian groups with specific presentations .",
    "the earliest such example was found by neumann  @xcite in 1950 as follows : @xmath15 , where @xmath16 for every integer @xmath17 . soon after , the first non - hopfian group with finite presentation was discovered by higman  @xcite as follows : @xmath18 .",
    "also a non - hopfian group with the simplest presentation up to now was produced by baumslag and solitar  @xcite as follows : @xmath19 .",
    "many other non - hopfian groups with specific finite presentations have been obtained by generalizing higman s group or baumslag - solitar s group ( see , for instance , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "another notable non - hopfian group was obtained by ivanov and storozhev  @xcite in 2005 .",
    "they constructed a family of finitely generated , but not finitely presented , non - hopfian relatively free groups with direct limits of hyperbolic groups , although the defining relations of their group presentations are not explicitly described in terms of generators .",
    "motivated by this background , we construct non - hopfian groups by using hyperbolic @xmath0-bridge link groups . in more detail , we construct a family of @xmath0-generator non - hopfian groups each of which has the form @xmath20 satisfying small cancellation conditions @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath21 is the single relator of the upper presentation of the link group of the @xmath0-bridge link of slope @xmath22 for every @xmath23 . here , the rational numbers @xmath22 may be parametrized by @xmath24 , and there is an explicit formula to express @xmath21 in terms of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
