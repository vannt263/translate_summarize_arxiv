    "improved staggered fermions are an attractive choice for numerical simulations of unquenched qcd  @xcite .",
    "they maintain the positive features of unimproved staggered fermions ",
    "smaller cpu requirements than other fermion discretizations , a remnant chiral symmetry , and @xmath0 discretization errors  while potentially avoiding its drawbacks  large flavor symmetry breaking and large perturbative matching factors .",
    "we have begun a program of calculations of electroweak matrix elements using these fermions , and thus need to decide between the different improvement schemes that have been suggested in the recent literature . since we intend at first to use one - loop perturbation theory to match lattice and continuum operators , it is important that the matching factors for relevant operators are close to unity . in this paper",
    "we calculate these matching factors for the bilinear operators which form the building blocks of the four - fermion operators we intend to use in our matrix element calculations .",
    "we expect our results to be a good guide to the size of corrections for the four - fermion operators themselves  typically the one - loop contributions get roughly doubled . in any case , finding small one - loop corrections for bilinears is a prerequisite for proceeding to four - fermion operators .",
    "we stress that we are using the term `` improvement '' loosely in this work .",
    "although the improved actions and operators that we use are motivated by the symanzik program , we are not following this program systematically .",
    "this would involve improving the gauge and fermion actions , and the operators , so as to remove @xmath0 errors either order by order in perturbation theory or non - perturbatively .",
    "such a program is much more difficult for staggered fermions than for wilson - like fermions , particularly with the operators we use which are spread out over a @xmath3 hypercube . our aim is to change the fermion action and operators such that the @xmath0 corrections are reduced from the large size typical of unimproved staggered fermions to the size seen with wilson , domain wall or overlap fermions .",
    "we do not improve the gauge action .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the alternatives we have considered for improved operators and actions .",
    "section [ sec : feynman ] collects the new features of the feynman rules that are introduced by improvement . in sec .",
    "[ sec : analytic ] we present analytic results for the one - loop matching constants .",
    "we then , in sec",
    ".  [ sec : tadhyp ] , describe how to do a second level of mean - field improvement of the bilinear operators .",
    "we close in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical ] with the numerical results and a discussion of their implications .",
    "we collect some definitions in an appendix , along with the results that allow us to push the analytic calculation one step further than in previous work .",
    "we lean heavily on the notation and methodology of ref .",
    "@xcite , and for brevity we refer to that paper as ps in the following .",
    "lepage  @xcite and lagae and sinclair  @xcite have argued that flavor symmetry breaking can be substantially reduced by suppressing the coupling of high momentum gluons which connect `` physical '' quarks residing at different corners of the brillouin zone .",
    "such suppression is also expected to reduce the size of one - loop contributions to perturbative matching factors , since , as noted by golterman  @xcite , their size is largely due to tadpole - type diagrams which involve these flavor - changing vertices .",
    "the flavor - changing coupling can be suppressed by replacing the standard `` thin '' link with some form of `` smeared '' link in the quark covariant derivative .",
    "various options have been tried , and we consider here two choices which have been successful at reducing flavor symmetry breaking in pion masses , are relatively local , and have been extensively studied : the `` fat-7 '' link introduced by orginos and toussaint  @xcite and studied numerically by the milc collaboration  @xcite , and the hyp link introduced by hasenfratz and knechtli  @xcite .",
    "we refer to the original papers for the details of the constructions and do not repeat them here .",
    "both are `` fattened '' by averaging over paths containing links in some or all of the transverse directions ( and which in the fat-7 case are up to 7 links long ) , and in this way they reduce the coupling to gluons with transverse momenta of @xmath4 . in some sense",
    "the fat-7 link is the simplest choice which accomplishes this , while the hyp link involves an average over more paths . on the other hand ,",
    "the hyp link involves three levels of ape - like smearing with projection back into su(3 ) .",
    "simulations show that such smearing is very effective at reducing flavor - symmetry breaking . indeed , using the hyp links",
    "leads to a greater reduction in flavor symmetry breaking than the fat-7 links .",
    "the introduction of smeared links can be viewed as one part of the symanzik improvement program applied at tree - level to staggered fermions .",
    "complete removal of @xmath0 terms from fermion vertices requires two other improvements  @xcite .",
    "first , the smearing of the links introduces an @xmath0 correction to the flavor - conserving quark - gluon coupling .",
    "this can be removed by a adding to the smearing a 5-link `` double staple''we refer to this as the `` lepage term '' .",
    "second , the @xmath0 corrections to the fermion propagator need to be removed , and this can be done by adding a next - to - nearest - neighbor derivative , the `` naik term ''  @xcite .",
    "an observation of practical relevance is that the naik term is the only part of the improvement of the fermion vertex that can not be accomplished simply by changing the links in the unimproved staggered action .",
    "in other words , if one does not include the naik term , and if one is interested in calculating propagators on configurations that have been already been generated ( whether quenched or unquenched ) then the practical implementation of smeared links is simple : one calculates the smeared links , and then uses an unimproved staggered inverter .",
    "complete tree - level @xmath0 improvement of physical quantities requires , in addition to the improvement of fermion vertex outlined above , the use of a tree - level ( or more highly ) improved gauge action .",
    "the previous discussion implies , however , that @xmath0 errors from the gauge action are not responsible for the large flavor - symmetry breaking or the large `` tadpole '' contributions to matching factors .    with these general comments in mind",
    ", we can now explain our choices of action and operators .",
    "we use the single - plaquette wilson gauge action , since this is the action we are using in our present simulations . for the fermion action",
    ", we keep the original staggered form ( without the naik term ) , but use various types of smeared links .",
    "the only exception is case ( 5 ) below , in which we keep the naik term .",
    "finally , for the bilinears we use the standard hypercube form ( the definition of which is given in the appendix ) , rendered gauge invariant by including the average of the product of links along the shortest paths between the quark and anti - quark field .",
    "the only improvement of the operators that we consider is the use of smeared links .",
    "intuitively , the reduction in fluctuations in these links will reduce the flavor symmetry breaking between bilinears  @xcite . in all cases",
    "we use the same type of smeared links in the operators as in the action , so that the hypercube vector current is conserved [ except in case ( 5 ) ] .",
    "the specific choices of links we consider are :    1 .   the original gauge links , tadpole improved ( following the prescription of ref .  @xcite as implemented in ps ) .",
    "we use the fourth root of the average plaquette to determine the `` average link '' @xmath5 .",
    "this yields ( tadpole - improved ) unimproved staggered fermions and unimproved operators , and allows us to check our results against those in ps .",
    "2 .   fat-7 smeared links , built out of tadpole improved links ( as in the numerical implementation of ref .",
    "we stress again that we use these smeared links both in the action and in the bilinear operators .",
    "fully @xmath0 improved smeared links , i.e. fat-7 links with the lepage `` double - staple '' term added , again both in the action and the operators .",
    "4 .   links smeared according the hyp prescription of hasenfratz and knechtli  @xcite , again both in the action and the operators .",
    "three parameters , @xmath6 , need to be specified to completely define hyp smearing , and we focus on two choices , as described below .",
    "we also consider a variant in which we tadpole improve the smeared links themselves ( section  [ sec : tadhyp ] ) .",
    "in addition , we consider a final choice of action and operators :    1 .",
    "following the `` asqtad '' action introduced by lepage  @xcite and used extensively by the milc collaboration  @xcite , we add the naik term to the action of choice 3 , while taking the same operators as in choice 3 . in the naik term alone",
    ", we use the original unsmeared gauge links ( tadpole improved ) .",
    "this differs from the `` asqtad '' action , however , because we use the unimproved wilson gauge action , whereas `` asqtad '' includes an improved gauge action .",
    "we thus refer to our choice as the `` asqtad - like '' action .",
    "our expectation is that the choice of gauge action has relatively little impact on the size of matching factors , and particularly on the variation of these factors between bilinears having the same spin and different flavor .",
    "the feynman rules for unimproved staggered fermions are standard . in the notation we use here",
    ", they can be found in ps , and we do not repeat them . we discuss only the changes introduced by smearing the links and including the naik term .    we consider first the effect of smearing the links . for all except tadpole diagrams ( i.e. those in which two gluons emerge from a single , possibly smeared , link ) , the only effect is to change the coupling to the underlying gluon field . with the unimproved action , a link in the @xmath7-th direction couples only to a gluon @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "the smeared links , however , couple to @xmath8 for all @xmath10 , and the extra factor this introduces can be conveniently written as @xmath11 the diagonal and off - diagonal couplings can be decomposed , respectively , as @xmath12 with @xmath13 , etc . , and @xmath14 where all indices ( @xmath15 ) are different .",
    "the coefficients @xmath16 distinguish the different choices of links :    1 .",
    "unimproved ( choice 1 above ) : @xmath17 2 .",
    "fat-7 links ( choice 2 above ) : @xmath18 3 .",
    "@xmath0 improved links ( choices 3 and 5 above ) : @xmath19 4 .",

    "this gives @xmath25 the second is chosen so to remove @xmath0 flavor - symmetry breaking couplings at tree level .",
    "this choice , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , gives @xmath29 i.e. the same as for fat-7 links .",
    "these results agree with those of refs .",
    "@xcite , but are written here in a somewhat different notation .",
    "the fact that all four choices can be collected in this form simplifies the resulting one - loop calculations .",
    "it is particularly noteworthy that the fat-7 and hyp vertices can be made identical , showing that these two choices can not be distinguished by their flavor breaking effects in perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "the one - loop matching factors for these two choices are not , however , identical , because the tadpole contributions differ .    for tadpole diagrams , which involve two - gluon vertices ,",
    "the differences between the actions are more complicated , and will be given explicitly below .",
    "the inclusion of the naik term alters the feynman rules in several ways . in the fermion propagator , all factors of @xmath30 are replaced : @xmath31 here we have introduced a fifth coefficient @xmath32 which distinguishes the different choices of action : @xmath33 unless the naik term is included , in which case @xmath34 . this device allows us to write most of our results in a way which holds for all choices of action and operators .",
    "the one - gluon vertex is also changed by the naik term , but this can only be represented in a simple way if one of the quarks in the vertex has vanishing physical momentum [ @xmath35 . in this case , the diagonal part of the vertex changes as follows : @xmath36 this substitution works for all except the self - energy diagram , which we consider explicitly below .",
    "the one - loop matching relations take the general form , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the color casimir factor , @xmath7 is the renormalization scale of the continuum operators , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 run over all the different possible bilinears in a four - flavor theory .",

    "@xmath52 diagrams involve the gluon connecting an external quark or antiquark line to the operator .",

    "the result is @xmath73 with @xmath74 , and @xmath75 the new functions are defined by @xmath76 and @xmath77 the single superscript `` @xmath78 '' reflects the fact that the naik term appears only at the quark - gluon vertex and not in the operator .",
    "note that , unlike @xmath79 , @xmath80 is not symmetrical .",
    "here we include tadpole diagrams both on the external quark and antiquark propagators ( i.e. self - energy contributions ) , and those coming from the bilinear . in the latter case",
    "we include all diagrams in which the two gluons both come from the bilinear , irrespective of whether they emanate from the same smeared link .",
    "thus , for the example of a distance-2 bilinear , which involves an average of a sum of products of two links , the gluon can couple between the links ( as well as going from each link back to itself ) .",
    "it is convenient to divide the contribution into two parts , @xmath81 with the former coming from gluon loops beginning and ending on the same smeared link , and the latter involving gluons propagating between smeared links . in both cases",
    "the result depends only on the distance @xmath82 of the bilinear .",
    "no simple general formula covers all choices of links and action , so we quote the results in turn .    1 .   for unimproved staggered fermions ,",
    "the result is ( ps ) @xmath83 where the factor of @xmath84 comes from tadpole improvement using the fourth - root of the plaquette .",
    "if one uses the trace of the landau gauge link , then @xmath84 is replaced by @xmath85 .",
    "2 .   for the fat-7 links",
    "( without the naik term ) , the result is the same as for unimproved staggered fermions , eq .",

    "we find @xmath87 where @xmath88 contains no naik vertices : @xmath89 we emphasize that , at this stage , there is no tadpole improvement factor for the hyp links ( although a related mean - field improvement will be introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : tadhyp ] ) .",
    "it is also noteworthy that this result would apply for both the fat-7 and @xmath0 improved links were one to also include projection back into su(3 ) in those cases  @xcite .",

    "now we turn to the `` off - diagonal '' tadpoles .",
    "these only arise from the bilinears , and not from the self - energy contributions , and are only present for operators with @xmath90 .",
    "since they are off - diagonal they are not affected by @xmath91 projection , and so take a common form for all actions and operators : @xmath92 here @xmath93 does not contain naik contributions , even for the asqtad - like action : @xmath94      if the naik term is not included in the action , the flavor - singlet vector current is conserved , and it follows from the corresponding ward identity that its matching factor vanishes . thus it must be that , in cases 1 - 4 , @xmath95 here we have used the result that @xmath96 for cases 1 - 4 .",
    "we have checked eq .",
    "( [ eq : zres ] ) analytically and numerically .",
    "we can not use this relation for the asqtad - like action , since the hypercube vector operator is not the conserved current ( as it does not contain a naik - like contribution ) .",
    "a direct calculation is needed , and we find : @xmath97 the first term in @xmath54 is the standard integral used to subtract the divergent piece .",
    "we have inserted @xmath32 in appropriate places so that this result is valid for all the actions we consider .",
    "it is possible to apply another level of tadpole , or , more accurately , mean - field , improvement to the operators and actions which involve smeared links . actually , for the hyp smeared links , this is the first level of tadpole improvement .",
    "the fluctuations in the smeared links are reduced compared to those of the original links but are still present .",
    "the residual fluctuations can be estimated and partially removed by defining a smeared mean - link by analogy with the definition of the original mean - link  @xcite : @xmath98 here the `` smeared - plaquette '' means the plaquette built out of smeared links .",
    "the operators are then mean - field improved by multiplying them by @xmath99 where @xmath82 is the number of links in the bilinear .",
    "the argument leading to this factor is identical to that used in ps when tadpole improving staggered operators , and we do not repeat it here . this procedure should be simple to implement in practice .    we have calculated the effect of such a mean - field improvement for fat-7 , @xmath0 improved , and hyp links .",
    "we have not applied it to the case of the asqtad - like action , because it is not entirely clear to us how to incorporate the naik term .",
    "we find that one must add to the tadpole contribution the following : @xmath100 \\ , , \\label{eq : tc}\\ ] ] where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are given in the previous section .",
    "the quantity in square parentheses evaluates to @xmath103 for fat-7 links , @xmath104 for @xmath0 improved links , @xmath105 for hyp links with @xmath106 , and to @xmath107 for hyp links with the `` fat-7 choice '' @xmath108 .",
    "these values are substantially smaller than the analogous factor in the tadpole improvement of the unsmeared links , namely @xmath84 .",
    "they are , nevertheless , significant , as we see in the next section .",
    "it is noteworthy that the fat-7 and @xmath0 improved smeared links receive a mean - field correction of opposite sign to that of both the hyp links .",
    "this indicates that the fluctuations in the former case have been `` overcompensated '' by smearing , and suggests that this higher level of mean - field improvement is likely to be more significant for the hyp smeared links .",
    "finally , we note that after this higher level of mean - field improvement , the results for fat-7 and hyp links with @xmath108 are identical .",
    "the equality of the tadpole contributions can be seen by combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : stagtad ] ) , ( [ eq : hyptad ] ) and ( [ eq : tc ] ) ; that of other contributions follows from the fact that the single - gluon vertex is the same in both cases .",
    "we present numerical results for the matching coefficients in tables  [ tab : cii][tab : ciitad ] . as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , the corrections are unchanged if the operators are multiplied by @xmath109 , due to the conserved axial symmetry .",
    "thus we show results for only half the operators .",
    "recall that we have chosen the ndr scheme ( @xmath110 with an anticommuting @xmath111 ) and set @xmath112 .",
    "we expect this to be a reasonable choice for the matching scale , but , in any case , the dependence of the @xmath113 on @xmath7 is weak , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : matching ] ) . , do not obviously generalize to the case of operators with non - vanishing anomalous dimensions .",
    "we return to this issue elsewhere  @xcite . ]",
    "the most striking result from the tables is the significant reduction in the size of one - loop corrections for all of the choices of smeared links .",
    "this is true also for the off - diagonal matching constants , although here the corrections were small to start with .",
    "we also see that the mean - field improvement of section  [ sec : tadhyp ] leads to a significant further reduction in the corrections for hyp smearing , although the corrections increase somewhat for fat-7 and @xmath0 improved smearing .    to compare the different alternatives for improvement we quote , in table  [ tab : ciirange ] , the range of variation of the diagonal coefficients @xmath114 , both for a given spin ( varying the flavor ) , and for all spins and flavors .",
    "the range for a given spin is independent of the renormalization scale @xmath7 ( since @xmath41 is the same for all flavors ) , and thus is a good measure of the size of lattice contributions to matching factors .",
    "the range for all spins and flavors does depend on @xmath7 , but only rather weakly .",
    "the table shows that , of the alternatives we have compared , fat-7 links , with or without mean - field improvement , and mean - field improved hyp or fat-7 links lead to the smallest range of corrections .",
    "a similar conclusion holds if we consider the maximum magnitude of the corrections rather than the spread .    .by",
    "-6ptdiagonal part of the one - loop matching constants , @xmath114 , using the ndr scheme with @xmath115 in the continuum .",
    "the components @xmath7 , @xmath10 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 are all different .",
    "results are given for six choices of action and operators : @xmath118 unimproved ; @xmath119 fat-7 links ; @xmath120 fully @xmath0 improved links ; @xmath121 fully @xmath0 improved links and naik term ( asqtad - like action ) ; @xmath122 hyp links with the smearing coefficients from ref .",

    "thus a matching coefficient @xmath128 corresponds to about a 10% correction at this lattice spacing .",
    "this is the size of corrections we are aiming for , and we see that tadpole improved hyp fermions lead to corrections of about this size .    finally , it is interesting to compare to the size of one - loop corrections for bilinears obtained with other fermion actions . for unimproved wilson fermions",
    "one finds , after tadpole improvement ( picking for definiteness the tadpole improvement scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath129 for @xmath130 , using the same renormalization scheme and scale for the continuum operator as in the tables .",

    "the lattice bilinears we use are specified by `` spin '' and `` flavor '' hypercube vectors @xmath139 and @xmath140 in the following way in terms of the staggered fields @xmath141 and @xmath142 : @xmath143 here the sums run over all positions in the hypercube , and @xmath144 \\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath145 composed of hermitian euclidean gamma matrices .",
    "it follows that the @xmath142 and @xmath141 fields are separated by a fixed number of links which is given by the `` distance '' @xmath146 . in the continuum limit",
    ", this lattice bilinear has the same spin , flavor and normalization as the continuum bilinear @xmath147 where @xmath148 is a four - flavor quark field , with spinor index @xmath149 and flavor index @xmath150 , both running from @xmath138 to @xmath151 , and the @xmath152 form a convenient basis for the flavor matrices .",

    "we consider here only continuum flavor non - singlet operators , so that we do not have to calculate diagrams in which the fermion fields in the bilinear are contracted together .    because the lattice bilinears are spread over a hypercube , the phase factors due the external quark and antiquark momenta depend upon the hypercube vectors @xmath158 and @xmath159 in eq .",
