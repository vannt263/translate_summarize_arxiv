    "the nucleus of the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068 is now firmly believed to be obscured from direct view .",
    "this was clearly inferred by antonucci & miller ( 1985 ) from a spectropolarimetric study , and now one of the major problems in this galaxy is to locate this hidden nucleus very accurately on the high - resolution images taken by the _ hst _  and on vlbi radio maps .",
    "this is particularly important , since the investigation of the physical conditions and kinematics of the nuclear vicinity is greatly influenced by the exact location of the hidden nucleus .",
    "several authors have addressed this problem , but most of the nuclear positions determined are indirect ones in the sense that they are from lower resolution images than the _ hst _  images or vlbi maps , and these positions are slightly different from one another ( see e.g. thatte et al .",
    "1997 and references therein ) .",
    "the only exception so far for pinpointing the location directly on the _ hst _  high - resolution images is to use imaging polarimetry data .",
    "the nucleus can be determined as the center of the centrosymmetric distribution of the position angle ( pa ) of polarization , which is expected to be observed if the radiation from the nucleus is being scattered by the surrounding gas .",
    "( we refer to this case as a ` point - source scattering case ' hereafter . )",
    "capetti et al .",
    "( 1995a , b ) have determined the nuclear location by this method . however , in their pa map , clear deviations from the centrosymmetric pattern are seen , and they did not state whether they are real , or discuss the observational error in pa at each position of the image .",
    "if the deviations are real , the nuclear position determined by them would not be very accurate and reliable .    in this paper ,",
    "we extend their work to discuss these deviations through the extensive estimation of the observational errors , and then to re - determine the location of the nucleus more accurately within a convincing error circle .",
    "our result is that the most probable location of the nucleus has moved to the north by @xmath3 , significantly larger than the quoted error of capetti et al .",
    "( 1995b ) .",
    "the second objective of this paper is to derive the three - dimensional structure of the nuclear region .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "images show that this region has a knotty and filamentary structure .",
    "if the uv radiation from each knot is dominated by the scattered radiation , the polarization degrees of the clouds provide the scattering angle at each cloud .",
    "hence , we can derive the three - dimensional distribution of these clouds with respect to the nucleus .",

    "the archival _ hst _  data used are summarized in table  [ table - data ] .",
    "the polarimetry data were obtained on february 28 , 1995 .",
    "these data have been published by capetti et al.(1995b ) .",
    "the central small portion was in the 10%-level nonlinear regime , so a flat - field linearity correction was applied , but we confirmed that this correction has no significant effect on our analysis , by implementing the same analysis below on the data without a linearity correction .",
    "the data were subsequently processed in the standard manner to correct for geometric distortion and flat - field response .",
    "the reseau marks were removed using neighboring pixels .",
    "the background subtraction was implemented using the outermost regions of the images .",
    "these data were obtained after the costar deployment , but at the time of this polarimetry observation _ hst _  had an extraordinarily poor focus due to a large movement of the secondary mirror , the effect of which will be discussed in detail below .",
    "therefore , the images through different polarizers ( pol0 , pol60 , pol120 ) , which are known to be slightly shifted relative to one another , were registered by using the image shift values of calibrations by hodge ( 1993 , 1995 ) , not by using point - like sources in the outer region .",
    "then the images were scaled according to the exposure times and the transmittances of the polarizers and the f253 m filter .",
    "( the filter transmits the uv radiation around 2400 - 2700 . )",
    "finally these images were combined to obtain the stokes parameter @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 images .",
    "using several archival _",
    "hst_/fos spectra taken with @xmath8 aperture , we have estimated the amount of the emission - line contamination in the f253 m image to be around the @xmath9 level .",
    "this includes , however , the broad feii lines which are also a part of the scattered light in addition to the scattered continuum ( antonucci , hurt , & miller 1994 ) .",
    "therefore , the effect of the line contamination on the polarization should be much smaller .",
    "we have also used the archival images of ngc  1068 taken through the f501n filter , i.e. , the [ oiii ] image , and through the f253 m filter but without polarizers , the focus of which seem to be fine .",
    "they were obtained on january 10 , 1994 , also after the costar deployment .",
    "they have been published by macchetto et al.(1994 ) .",
    "the images were processed through the same procedure as above , but in the f501n image , the central nonlinear and saturated portion was filled with the appropriately scaled image taken with the f4nd filter . the pattern noise associated with the foc nonlinearity was removed by fourier filtering .",
    "the registration of these two images was carried out using point - like sources in the outer region , with the uncertainty of less than 1.4 pixel .",
    "the registration of this f253 m image and the @xmath5 ( total intensity ) image from the polarimetry data was done by taking a cross - correlation , because of the bad focus in the @xmath5 image .",
    "we also tried this registration using point sources and found the results coincide within 1 pixel .",
    "both of the observations were implemented in normal @xmath10 mode , where the pixel size is @xmath11 and the field of view is @xmath12 .      due to the bad focus in the imaging polarimetry observation",
    ", the images have a significant blurring .",
    "the effect on the polarization analysis should be significant especially at the region where the gradient of the polarized flux distribution is large .",
    "we first estimate the extent of this blurring by using the fine - focus ( non - polarimetric ) f253 m image .    to avoid confusion",
    ", we call this f253 m image without polarizers a `` sharp '' uv image , and the @xmath5 image of the polarimetry simply an @xmath5 image",
    ". synthetic aperture photometry was carried out to take the ratio of the @xmath5 image to the sharp uv image at various aperture diameters , and the results on a few tens of local maxima over the image were averaged .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig - cm ] .",
    "the scatter of the ratio for each aperture is shown as a vertical line .",
    "the expected amount of the error in the ratio due to statistical noise is also shown with horizontal ticks .",
    "as we expect that the local peak intensity is lowered by the blurring , the average ratio is certainly less than unity and it becomes smaller with smaller aperture , about 0.9 at @xmath13 aperture , down to @xmath10.85 at @xmath14 ( though the statistical significance of these average ratios becomes lower with smaller aperture ) .",
    "the regions in the @xmath5 image with this ratio larger than @xmath15 have significant ` leaks ' from the neighboring bright regions .    to infer correctly the degradation of the point spread function ( psf ) of this observation ,",
    "we have estimated the amount of the secondary mirror motion in the following way .",
    "we constructed model psfs using tinytim ( krist 1993 ) with a range of secondary mirror movement and convolved the sharp uv image with those psfs .",
    "then we compared them to the @xmath5 image which is convolved with the psf of nominal focus for equivalence .",
    "we calculated the ratio of these two by the same synthetic aperture photometry as in figure  [ fig - cm ] .",
    "it is expected that this ratio becomes unity for all aperture sizes when the appropriate amount of the secondary mirror shift is taken for the model psf .",
    "we found that this was the case for a shift of about @xmath16 microns .",
    "the model psf at this focus indicates that the fwhm of the psf was @xmath17 at the time of the observation .",
    "therefore , we decided to implement our analysis in three ways ; ( a ) @xmath18 pixel binning , corresponding to @xmath19 , ( b ) @xmath20 pixel binning , ( c ) @xmath13 aperture diameter synthetic photometry .",
    "the size for the cases ( a ) and ( c ) could be too small , but the effect of small aperture will be taken into account in the error estimation . for case ( c ) ,",
    "the aperture centers are selected as the local peaks in the @xmath5 image , which are thought to represent the positions of the resolved clouds in this nuclear region .",
    "in order to examine the pa distribution accurately , we need extensive estimation of the observational error in the _",

    "\\(2 ) uncertainty from the image registrations of three polarizer images . as described in   [ s - data - red ] , we have registered the images using the calibrated values of hodge ( 1995 ) and their wavelength dependence by hodge ( 1993 ) .",
    "the calibrated image shifts have an uncertainty of about @xmath21 pixel .",
    "therefore we shifted pol60 and pol120 images by this amount along the image x and y axes relative to pol0 image and calculated the resulting change of the polarization .",
    "\\(3 ) polarizer axes uncertainty .",
    "the transmission axes of each polarizer have nominal values of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 with respect to the @xmath25 axis of the image , and those values have about @xmath26 uncertainties ( nota et al .",
    "the errors in the calculated polarization due to this uncertainty were estimated by considering the dependence of the calculated polarization on the polarizer axes angles ( see appendix for more detail ) .      *",
    "each polarizer , especially pol60 , has different wavelength dependence of transmittance , so when the spectrum of the object changes from place to place , each polarizer s image has to be multiplied by a different factor to correct for the different effective throughput . by assuming a power - law source spectrum and varying the power - law index in a reasonable range",
    ", we estimate that this has effects of less than about 1% in the correction factors .",
    "* differences in psfs through each polarizer result in uncertainties in these multiplying factors locally .",
    "we estimate this effect from the result given by hodge ( 1995 ) , who has investigated the differences in the fluxes of unpolarized point sources through different polarizers over various aperture sizes .",
    "although this is for data with nominal focus , the maximum uncertainties for our out - of - focus data can be estimated for each of our binning size ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) above , from the flux differences of smaller aperture size in hodge s result . for cases ( a ) and ( c )",
    ", the relative discrepancies between the fluxes through each polarizer are expected to be less than 3 to 4 % , reading from hodge s plots for 3 to 5 pixel aperture radius , and for case ( b ) less than 2 to 3% , from the same plots for @xmath27 to 10 pixel aperture radius .",
    "the fact that hodge s result is for point sources while our sources are more extended , gives us additional support that the values above can be considered as the maximum uncertainties .",
    "* flat - fielding uncertainty .",
    "the flat fields used by the foc standard calibration are heavily smoothed and they do not correct for the fine scale features in the original , unsmoothed flat fields . we have estimated the resulting flat - fielding uncertainties by calculating the deviations of the unsmoothed flat field from the smoothed one , for the used portion of the image .",
    "the results are about 3% for the cases ( a ) and ( c ) , 2% for the case ( b ) .    taking the sum of the squares of these ( i)@xmath1(iii ) factors , we consider uncertainties in each multiplying factor as 5% for cases ( a ) and ( c ) , 4% for case",
    "( b ) , at most .",
    "the effect of these uncertainties on the polarization were calculated from the dependence of the polarization on these multiplying factors ( see appendix for more detail ) .",
    "the total error was estimated by combining in quadrature all the uncertainties above from ( 1 ) to ( 4 ) .",
    "source ( 4 ) is usually larger than ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . typically , the total estimated error in the polarization degree , @xmath28 , in the regions of sufficient statistical s / n ( the portion of the data used in the analysis below ) was about @xmath29 for the cases ( a ) and ( c ) , while about @xmath30 for the case ( b ) . if the statistical error is excluded , the quadratic sum of the other three was about @xmath31 for cases ( a ) and ( c ) , about @xmath32 for case ( b ) .",

    "as shown in capetti et al . ( 1995b ) , the overall pa distribution is quite centrosymmetric , quite close to a ` point - source scattering case ' .",
    "however , clear deviations from the centrosymmetric pattern are seen in some regions , especially around the very center ( see their fig.2 ) .",
    "we now examine these deviations and discuss whether the data are really consistent with this simple model , based on the pa errors estimated in the previous section and also on the investigation of the bad - focus effect discussed in   [ s - data - focus ] .",
    "we evaluate whether the data are really consistent with point - source scattering by calculating the @xmath33  value . for each @xmath34th binned pixel or aperture , denote the pa data as @xmath35 , and the ideal centrosymmetric pa with a certain symmetric center @xmath36 as @xmath37 .",

    "the ideal centrosymmetric pa for one large binned pixel or aperture depends on , in addition to the direction to the symmetric center , the polarized flux distribution within that pixel .",
    "therefore we used the original , not binned , distribution of polarized flux within the binned pixel or aperture for the calculation of the @xmath33  value .",
    "that is , we calculate the `` polarized - flux - weighted '' ideal centrosymmetric pa ( actually , weighted further by the reciprocal of statistical error of polarized flux , to avoid having too much weight on the pixels with low s / n polarized flux ) as @xmath40 where @xmath41 the quantities @xmath42 are the polarized flux , statistical error in the polarized flux , and central point , for the original pixel @xmath43 within the @xmath44 binned pixel , respectively .",
    "these are illustrated in figure  [ fig - idealpa ] .",
    "the summations are taken over all pixels @xmath43 within the @xmath44 binned pixel .",
    "the angle @xmath45 corresponds to the ideal centrosymmetric pa for the center of the pixel @xmath43 .",
    "this correction in the ideal pa ( the difference between the polarized - flux - weighted ideal pa and the centrosymmetric pa which is calculated simply for the center of the binned pixel or aperture ) was found to be very important in the central bright and knotty region . in this region , the amount of the correction was larger than the total error of pa estimated in   [ s - data - err ] .",
    "the extraordinarily degraded psf of these polarimetry data can affect the pa distribution significantly , especially in the pixels surrounding the bright clouds , even with relatively large pixel binning .",
    "we eliminate this effect from the analysis by masking out the binned pixels or apertures which are suspected to have significant ` leak ' from the surrounding pixels .",
    "if we take the ratio of the @xmath5 image to the sharp uv image for each bin or aperture , the pixels or apertures which are not affected by the surrounding regions should have this ratio less than around unity , which can also be down to @xmath46 for @xmath13 aperture as shown in figure  [ fig - cm ] and discussed in   [ s - data - focus ] .",
    "we call this ratio here a `` contamination measure ''",
    ". we should mask out the region where this contamination measure is much larger than unity , so we set an appropriate threshold on this contamination measure , which we denote as @xmath47}_{\\rm max}$ ] .",

    "the result is that , choosing appropriate thresholds on these two factors , we have obtained minimum reduced @xmath33  ( the @xmath33  divided by degrees of freedom ) of slightly less than unity for all three binning cases from ( a ) to ( c ) .",
    "this indeed means that these polarimetry data are totally consistent with point - source scattering , within the accuracy of the foc polarimetry . in figure  [ fig - csm ] , we show the map of the minimum reduced @xmath33   value in the case ( a ) , for various sets of @xmath47}_{\\rm max}$ ]  and @xmath50}_{\\rm min}$ ] .",

    "furthermore , there is a clear transition between these two regions where the gradient of @xmath33  is large and @xmath33   switches to an acceptable value when @xmath47}_{\\rm max}$ ]  becomes smaller .",
    "similar results have been obtained for the cases ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "therefore we conclude that the pa distribution is consistent with a point - source scattering only when the contaminated regions are excluded .",
    "now that the point - source scattering fit is proved to be acceptable , we can discuss the most probable location of the nucleus as the position of the minimum @xmath33  point , and its error as the contour of the @xmath33  image .",
    "we show the pa distribution and the point with the @xmath33  being minimum for each case ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) in figure  [ fig - pa - a ] , [ fig - pa - b ] , and [ fig - pa - c ] , respectively .",

    "also shown in black vectors are the polarized - flux - weighted ideal centrosymmetric pa with the symmetric center being the minimum @xmath33   point , marked as a plus , for each binning case .",

    "i.e. , the most probable location of the nucleus , is very close to the uv brightest cloud , in all cases from ( a ) to ( c ) , as seen in figure  [ fig - nuc ] covering just the central @xmath56 region .",
    "the white dash - dot contour represents the uv image , while underlying is the [ oiii ] image through the f501n filter .",

    "the reason for this difference is quite clear .",
    "corresponding to the `` transition '' of the minimum @xmath33  value in figure  [ fig - csm ] from @xmath47}_{\\rm max}$ ]  of 1.3 to 1.1 , we have found that the position of the minimum @xmath33  point experiences the transition from @xmath58 , which is almost within the error of the capetti et al .",

    "we found two regions on the plane of ( @xmath47}_{\\rm max}$ ] , @xmath50}_{\\rm min}$ ] ) where the position of the minimum @xmath33  point is stable , just corresponding to the two regions in figure  [ fig - csm ] where the minimum @xmath33  values are almost constant .",
    "these results are for case ( a ) , but we see quite similar results for cases ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "therefore , the difference between the two locations is expected to arise from the masking - out procedure for the regions contaminated by the focus effect .",

    "so the minimum @xmath33  point moves to the north when these regions are excluded .",
    "these pas in the masked - out regions clearly can not be fit by point - source scattering , and we have certainly shown that the minimum @xmath33  becomes acceptable only if we mask out these regions .",
    "the tendency is that the deviations in these regions can be explained by the contamination from the neighboring bright regions . since",
    "our masking - out procedure is quite natural and reasonable , and this tendency gives us further support for our procedure , we conclude that the capetti et al . point should be revised to a more northern point , indicated by our minimum @xmath33  positions .",
    "the error of the location of the symmetric center can be estimated as contours of the @xmath33  image .",
    "the contour of 99% confidence level has been drawn for each binning method in figures  @xmath60 , and these three different contours are all shown with an enlarged scale in figure  [ fig - nuc ] in three different white circles .",
    "these three are slightly different from one another .",
    "this is partly due to the uncertainties in our estimation of pa errors , but the error circle for case ( b ) is smaller in the north - south direction partly due to the fact that the valid data points in case ( b ) are more extended to the east and west ( fig .",
    "[ fig - pa - b ] ) , while in cases ( a ) and ( c ) they are only extended to the north and south .",
    "as we described in ",
    "[ s - data - err ] , the uncertainty in the `` correction factor '' should be considered as the maximum possible , which might be indicated also by the fact that our minimum @xmath33   value is slightly smaller than unity .",
    "we have also implemented the calculation of @xmath33  with a slightly smaller value for this uncertainty , and found that the minimum @xmath33  points and northern part of the error circles were almost stable , whereas the southern part of the error circles moved slightly to the north .",
    "this shift is about @xmath14 if we take the uncertainty in the correction factor to be 4% for cases ( a ) and ( c ) , and 3% for case ( b ) , instead of 5% for ( a ) and ( c ) , and 4% for ( b ) . in figure  [ fig - nuc ] ,",
    "the error circle of 99% confidence level has been drawn as a black contour for the case ( b ) with 3% uncertainty in the correction factor .",

    "we infer the three - dimensional structure of the nuclear region , by using the polarization degrees as the indicator of scattering angles or ` viewing angles ' at each resolved cloud in the image .",
    "interpretation of the polarization degree is usually difficult , due to the existence of unpolarized , `` diluting '' radiation in terms of polarization , such as starlight . in the nuclear region of ngc  1068",
    ", however , there is some evidence that suggests the diluting radiation in the uv range is fairly small , as described below .",
    "if this is correct , we are in the unusual situation that we can infer the distribution of the nuclear resolved clouds three - dimensionally .",
    "the polarization degree reflects the angle between our line of sight to the scatterers and the line of sight of those scatterers themselves to the illuminating source , which we call here ` viewing angles ' of the scattering clouds , as shown in figure  [ fig - clump]a .",
    "if we obtain the viewing angles of each cloud , we can locate each cloud along the line of sight with respect to the central radiation source , and thus we will be able to have a three - dimensional view of this nuclear region .",
    "we simply assume here that the uv radiation consists of only radiation scattered by free electrons and no other diluting component exists .",
    "this is based on the following two observational arguments in ngc  1068 .",
    "\\(i ) _ hst_/fos",
    "uv spectropolarimetry shows that the polarization is almost constant over the uv range and its degree declines only in the wavelength longer than @xmath77  ( antonucci et al . 1994 ) .",
    "this has been interpreted to mean that the starlight contribution is significant only in the redward of @xmath78 , almost outside the f253 m filter transmission .",
    "\\(ii ) the same fos spectropolarimetry and also the ground - based spectropolarimetry shows no evidence of any enhancement in polarization in the broad lines relative to the nuclear continuum .",
    "the broad lines are believed to originate only in a region much more compact than the scattering region that we have seen in our imaging polarimetry data .",
    "any diluting radiation such as starlight or free - free emission from the scattering region itself ( tran 1995c ) , only dilutes the polarization of the scattered continuum , not the scattered broad lines .",
    "therefore , if diluting radiation were present , the polarization would be higher in the broad lines than in the continuum , which has been observed in several seyfert  2 galaxies , but not in ngc  1068 ( antonucci et al . 1994 ; tran 1995a , b ) .",
    "those spectropolarimetric data , however , cover a large area , @xmath79 aperture in antonucci et al.s data and a @xmath80 wide slit in tran s data , which could mean that the assumption of scattered - light domination might be true only in the brightest clouds .",
    "therefore we restrict ourselves to use only the polarization degree of the bright knots .",
    "we will discuss the validity of this assumption again in ",
    "[ s - disc-3d ] .",
    "the following method for obtaining the three - dimensional gas distribution and its result have been discussed in kishimoto ( 1997 ) .",
    "we present the method and results here , with the errors in the observed polarization that have been estimated in much more detail , and with the position of the nucleus that has been obtained more accurately .",
    "the polarization of the scattered radiation from a cloud depends basically on its viewing angle , but also on the size of the cloud compared to the distance to the illuminating source .",
    "this effect is large if the cloud is very close to the source . in this section",

    "we consider only electron scattering , because the primary scatterers in the innermost region of ngc  1068 are thought to be electrons ( antonucci & miller 1985 ; miller , goodrich & matthews 1991 ) .",
    "the calculation of polarization for optically thin systems of axisymmetric distribution has been implemented by brown & mclean ( 1977 ) .",

    "our three quantities , polarization of the scattered radiation @xmath49 , viewing angle @xmath85 , and the relative cloud radius @xmath86 , are related as @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a function of @xmath89 and defined as @xmath90 we find the shape factor @xmath84 as @xmath91 where @xmath92 since the projected distance @xmath93 is the observational quantity whereas the actual distance @xmath82 is not , we re - write @xmath89 as @xmath94 these relations are rather complicated , but for small  @xmath89 , @xmath84 becomes close to unity , hence @xmath83 close to @xmath95 , and eq.([eq - pol ] ) becomes the well - known equation for thomson scattering as      this means that the shape of the cloud or the distribution of the gas inside the cloud does not affect the polarization of the scattered radiation if the cloud size is small enough compared with the distance to the illuminating source , and the polarization depends only on the viewing angle , as a natural consequence .    the three - dimensional positions of the clouds can now be obtained , given the position of the central source in the image @xmath97 . if we denote the position of the center of each cloud in the image as @xmath98 , the distance @xmath99 for each cloud from the sky plane in which the nucleus resides ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - clump]b ) is written as @xmath100 where @xmath101    one of the ambiguities in this method is that , due to the forward - backward symmetry of the optically thin electron scattering , there are two possible viewing angles derived from a single value of polarization , i.e. the forward and backward scattering case .",
    "these two angles correspond to the two positions along the line of sight , shown as figure  [ fig - clump]b .",
    "also , if a cloud is not sufficiently resolved , several clumps may exist along one line of sight",
    ". this could be the limit of our method , but in this case , the two positions derived from the polarization set a constraint on the positions of the clouds .",
