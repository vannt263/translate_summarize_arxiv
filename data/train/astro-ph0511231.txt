    "active - sterile neutrino oscillations may considerably effect the early universe , and in particular bbn .",
    "they are capable of exciting additional light particles into equilibrium , thus , affecting the expansion rate @xmath13 , and they may also distort neutrino energy spectrum and generate neutrino - antineutrino asymmetry , thus , in case of electron - sterile oscillations @xmath14 , influencing the weak interaction rates of @xmath8 and , hence , the kinetics of nucleons at the pre - bbn epoch and the primordial nucleosynthesis .    among the light elements produced primordially",
    ", @xmath3he is the most abundantly produced , most precisely measured and calculated  @xcite , and usually it is the chosen element for putting bbn constraints on oscillations .",
    "cosmological constraints on neutrino oscillations parameters , based on bbn and @xmath3he observational data , have been discussed in numerous publications , see for example refs .",
    "@xcite , the review papers  @xcite and the references there in .",
    "all available constraints were obtained assuming that the sterile state was empty before oscillations @xmath15 , i.e. that it has been filled only due to active - sterile mixing during oscillations .",
    "@xmath16 is the number of neutrino species in equilibrium .    in general",
    ", however , @xmath1 state may not be initially empty . there",
    "exist numerous possibilities of producing @xmath1 before @xmath14 oscillations : from gut models , large extra dimensions models , manyfold universe models , mirror matter models , etc .",
    "they may be also produced in preceding @xmath17 oscillations in 4-neutrino and 5-neutrino mixing schemes .",
    ", which could have been eventually produced by oscillations . ]",
    "the degree of initial population of @xmath1 , @xmath6 , and its energy spectrum depends on the concrete model of @xmath1 production .",
    "non - zero initially @xmath6 can influence the dynamical and the kinetic effects of oscillations on bbn  @xcite and change the cosmological limits on oscillations .",
    "the aim of this work is to define how and to what extend the available cosmological constraints on @xmath14 oscillation parameters , obtained with the assumption @xmath18 , are changed in the more general case of initially non - zero sterile population @xmath19 .    in the next section",
    "i discuss how @xmath20 influences oscillations effects on bbn and provide qualitative considerations of the expected change of cosmological constraints . in section 3",
    "i present the results of the numerical analysis of @xmath3he production in bbn with nonequilibrium @xmath0 oscillations and initially nonzero @xmath1 population @xmath21 and discuss the generalized cosmological constraints on oscillation parameters . in the last section the results and the assumptions of the model",
    "are resumed and possibilities of relaxing the cosmological constraints are discussed .",
    "i discuss the generalization of bbn constraints on @xmath14 neutrino oscillations parameters for the case of oscillations effective after electron neutrino decoupling .",
    "it is known that at lower mass differences , when sterile neutrino production takes place after active neutrino decoupling , due to @xmath0 oscillations between initially empty @xmath1 and electron neutrino , i.e. for @xmath22 , the re - population of active neutrino becomes slow and kinetic equilibrium may be strongly broken by @xmath14 oscillations .",
    "i will denote these oscillations with an initially non - equilibrium sterile neutrino further on nonequilibrium oscillations for short .",
    "they may cause considerable deviations of the @xmath8 energy spectrum from the equilibrium fermi - dirac form  @xcite ( called further spectrum distortion ) and generate neutrino - antineutrino asymmetry   and small mixings  @xcite , where it may play the dominant role . ] , thus influencing the weak interaction rates of the processes governing pre - bbn nucleon kinetics @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 the nucleons freezing and correspondingly the primordial elements production .  .",
    "@xcite ]    for that oscillation case a numerical analysis of the evolution of the neutrino and nucleons , using the kinetic equations for the neutrino density matrix and neutrino number densities in momentum space was provided to make a proper account for the neutrino spectrum distortion , depletion and neutrino asymmetry growth at each momentum  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of such oscillations , accounting precisely for the kinetic effect , allowed to put stringent constraints on oscillations effective after active neutrino decoupling  @xcite .",
    "the analytical fits to the exact constraints , corresponding to @xmath10 @xmath3he overproduction , are  @xcite : @xmath26    these constraints , as well as all existing in literature bbn constraints , concern the case of empty sterile neutrino state at the start of oscillations .",
    "the presence of a nonzero @xmath6 before oscillations exerts two types of effects on bbn  @xcite :    \\(i ) it increases the energy density by @xmath27 , thus modifying the cosmic expansion rate @xmath28 , which reflects into higher freezing temperature of the nucleons and overproduction of @xmath3he  @xcite .",
    "the dynamical effect of initially present @xmath6 on primordial @xmath3he production will be denoted further on by @xmath29 . due to this effect * strengthening of the cosmological bounds * with respect to the ones calculated at @xmath18 should be expected .    in case of @xmath17 oscillations",
    "the dynamical effect is the only effect of non - zero @xmath6 present before oscillations . in the case of @xmath0 oscillations _ with almost equilibrium neutrino energy distribution _ , i.e. oscillations taking place before neutrino decoupling , this is the leading effect as well .",
    "this effect can be accounted for simply by adding the initial @xmath6 value to the one produced in oscillations .",
    "so , in both these cases the rescaling of the existing constraints is rather straightforward .",
    "\\(ii ) in the nonequilibrium @xmath0 oscillations case , the presence of partially populated @xmath1 suppresses the oscillations effects on pre - bbn nucleons kinetics  @xcite . further on this kinetic effect is denoted by @xmath30 , while the kinetic effects of oscillations are denoted by @xmath31 ( or in terms of the effective degrees of freedom @xmath32 , where @xmath33 ) .",
    "kinetic effects are a result of the generated energy spectrum distortion of @xmath8 in oscillations between active and sterile neutrino , and to a smaller degree are due to the neutrino - antineutrino asymmetry , generated by oscillations .",
    ", it effects indirectly bbn by suppressing oscillations at small mixing angles , leading to less overproduction of he-4 compared to the case without the account of asymmetry growth @xcite . ] both are very sensitive to the degree of population of @xmath1 because the rate of oscillations is energy dependent .",
    "the spectrum distortion effect plays however the dominant role , so it will be discussed in more detail further on , although we have accounted precisely for both .",
    "the distortion of @xmath8 spectrum leads both to a _ depletion of the active neutrino number densities _",
    "@xmath16 : @xmath34 and a decrease of the @xmath35 , causing an earlier @xmath36-freezing and an overproduction of @xmath37he yield .",
    "the spectrum distortion is the greatest in the case the sterile state is empty at the start of oscillations , @xmath38 .",
    "it decreases with the increase of the degree of population of the sterile state at the onset of oscillations as illustrated in the following figure from ref .  @xcite .",
    "+    + fig.1 .",
    "the figure gives a snapshot of the spectrum distortion of the electron neutrino energy spectrum @xmath39 , where @xmath40 at a characteristic temperature @xmath41 mev , caused by resonant oscillations with a mass difference @xmath42 ev@xmath43 and mixing @xmath44 for different degrees of initial sterile neutrino population , namely @xmath18 ( lower curve ) , @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( upper curve ) .",
    "the dashed curve gives the equilibrium spectrum for comparison .",
    "so , larger @xmath6 leads to a decrease of the kinetic effects of oscillations and to a decrease of the overproduction of @xmath3he by oscillations with respect to the case of initially zero @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the kinetic effect corresponding to zero initial population of the sterile state , which presents in fact the maximal kinetic effect at a given set of oscillation parameters .",
    "oscillations effective after @xmath8 decoupling , these kinetic effects @xmath49 can be considerable , as large as @xmath50  @xcite . ] due to the decrease @xmath51 in the overproduction of @xmath7 , caused by the suppression of @xmath32 by the initially present @xmath19 , * relaxation of the cosmological bounds * with respect to the ones corresponding to an initially empty @xmath1 state should be expected .",
    "obviously , there is an interplay between the two types of effects ( i ) and ( ii ) induced by non - zero @xmath6 .",
    "the total effect depends on the concrete values of the oscillation parameters and @xmath6 . _",
    "the shift of the constraints may be expected in either direction ( relaxing or constraining the existing constraints ) _ and its analysis requires numerical study , accounting precisely for @xmath8 energy spectrum distortion and the suppression of the kinetic effects , which is essential .    using the approximate empirical formula giving the dependence of @xmath7 production on the two effects , obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath52 it is possible to make some predictions concerning the value and the sign of the @xmath3he overproduction and the direction of the shift of the bbn .",
    "here @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , while @xmath56 .",
    "* first : the total effect of oscillations for initially non - zero * @xmath6 * on @xmath3he production is smaller than the sum of the energy density increase effect ( i ) * @xmath29 * and the maximum kinetic effect of oscillations ( ii ) * @xmath57 corresponding to zero @xmath6 , due to the term @xmath58 expressing the decrease of oscillations kinetic effect with @xmath6 .",
    "the results of the exact numerical study of the effects ( i ) and ( ii ) on @xmath3he overproduction , illustrated in the following figures , confirm this estimation . in fig.2a and fig.2b the contribution of the different effects on neutron - to - nucleon freezing ratio @xmath59 is presented .",
    "( the @xmath7 production mainly depends on @xmath60 , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the neutron lifetime . )",
    "the dotted curve shows the kinetic effect dependence on @xmath6 , the lower dashed curve gives the energy increase effect .",
    "the total effect is presented by the solid curve , which although has different behavior in the two cases ( decreasing or increasing ) , is situated considerably lower than the uppermost long - dashed curve presenting the sum of the effects ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "+    + fig.2a .",
    "the solid curve presents the frozen neutron number density relative to nucleons @xmath59 as a function of the sterile neutrino initial population , at @xmath63 ev@xmath43 , @xmath64 .",
    "the dotted curve presents the kinetic effect , while the lower dashed curve presents energy density increase effect .",
    "the uppermost long dashed curve corresponds to the total effect when the decrease of the kinetic effect is not accounted for , as if the initial @xmath6 were stored in a state not participating in oscillations with electron neutrino , and the effects were simply additive .    _ hence , the cosmological constraints will be less stringent than in the case of simply additive effects . _ the latter case will have place when the enhancement of the energy density @xmath6 is due to other additional particles brought partially into equilibrium ( like sterile neutrinos in the muon or tau - sectors , or other relic relativistic particles ) while the sterile state , which participates further in oscillations with the electron neutrino is initially empty . in that case",
    "the two effects will be simply additive , and the uppermost long - dashed curve in figs.2 presents the overproduction of @xmath3he for such specific situation .",
    "+    + fig.2b .",
    "the solid curve presents the frozen neutron number density relative to nucleons @xmath65 as a function of the sterile neutrino initial population , at @xmath66 ev@xmath43 , @xmath64 .",
    "the dotted curve presents the kinetic effect , while the lower dashed curve presents energy density increase effect .",
    "the uppermost long dashed curve corresponds to the total effect if the effects were simply additive .    however , due to the fact that @xmath67 is a decreasing function of @xmath6 , naively adding the two effects exaggerates @xmath7 overproduction , and hence would define stronger bounds than the real ones .    *",
    "second : the direction of the shift of the constraints should be as follows : in case @xmath68 the constraints will be strengthened in comparison with the @xmath18 constraints , while in the opposite case they will be relaxed .",
    "*    in fig.2a the solid curve , presenting the total effect , is a decreasing function of @xmath6 because @xmath69 , i.e. for that set of oscillation parameters the overproduction of @xmath3he due to oscillations decreases with the increase of the initial population of the sterile neutrino state .",
    "obviously the suppression effect ( ii ) dominates . in that case",
    "we expect relaxation of the cosmological constraints compared to the case of initially zero population of @xmath1 .",
    "fig.2b presents the results for a set of oscillation parameters for which @xmath70 , then as it is illustrated the total effect is an increasing function of @xmath6 , the dynamical effect ( i ) dominates over ( ii ) , thus the overproduction of @xmath3he increases in respect to the case of @xmath18 and hence , the cosmological constraints must become more stringent with the increase of @xmath6 . and",
    "as far as @xmath71 at @xmath18 , the bbn constraints , corresponding to @xmath3he observational uncertainty expressed as @xmath72 , will be strengthened .",
    "for example , @xmath3he uncertainty @xmath73 corresponds to @xmath74 .",
    "thus at @xmath18 @xmath75 , and hence strengthening of the cosmological constraints is expected .",
    "the exact form of the cosmological constraints obtained by a detail numerical study of the effects ( i ) and ( ii ) and corresponding to such @xmath3he overproduction and different @xmath6 values is presented in the next section . in case of bigger @xmath3he uncertainty , parametrized by @xmath76 , the term ( ii )",
    "dominates ( as illustrated in fig.2a ) , leading to a decrease of the @xmath3he overproduction due to oscillations and hence , relaxation of the cosmological constraints should be expected .",
    "it is interesting to note that contrary to some prejudice , even for @xmath3he uncertainty equivalent to @xmath76 cosmological constraints on oscillation parameters still persist , provided that @xmath77 and that a proper description of the neutrino energy spectrum distortion is made .",
    "for calculating cosmological constraints on oscillation parameters , i have followed the kinetic approach described in detail in ref .",
    "the case of @xmath0 oscillations effective after electron neutrino decoupling is considered . for simplicity mixing just in the electron sector",
    "is assumed .",
    "the more general case of a sterile neutrino state being partially filled before the oscillations become effective is studied . in a previous work",
    "@xcite it was shown that for a wide range of @xmath6 values the kinetic effects of oscillations , namely spectrum distortion of the electron neutrino and lepton asymmetry growth , play a considerable role , hence rough analytical estimations of the kinetic effects are not applicable  @xcite .",
    "therefore , here an exact numerical analysis of @xmath6 effects ( i ) and ( ii ) on pre - bbn nucleons freezing and the production of @xmath3he in bbn with oscillations is provided .",
    "the kinetic equations for the density matrix of neutrino and antineutrino ensembles are simultaneously and selfconsistently solved with the kinetic equations governing the evolutions of nucleons from the period of neutrino decoupling @xmath78 mev till the nucleons freezing epoch , down to @xmath79 mev .",
    "the neutrino spectrum is described by 1000 bins for the nonresonant case , and by more than 5000 bins ( depending on the asymmetry growth region of oscillation parameters ) .",
    "this detail study , performed for a wider range of parameters , confirms the importance of the kinetic effect at non - zero @xmath6 , found in ref .",
    "i calculate primordial @xmath3he yield @xmath80 at different @xmath6 values for the full set of oscillations parameters of the model : for all mixing angles @xmath81 and mass differences @xmath82 ev@xmath43 .    for the analysis of the constraints the observational uncertainty of the primordially produced @xmath3he",
    "is assumed @xmath83 in correspondence with the accepted systematic error in the @xmath37he measurements  @xcite .",
    "then the maximum possible value of @xmath6 at bbn epoch is constrained on the basis of bbn considerations : using the approximate empirical formula @xmath84 , @xmath85 corresponds to @xmath86 .",
    "so , in our analysis we have varied @xmath6 in the range @xmath87 with a step 0.1 .",
    "the case @xmath88 corresponds to higher @xmath37he uncertainty and will not be studied here .",
    "this choice of maximum @xmath6 is also supported by the results of the recent standard bbn analysis + @xmath37he observational data with an input the baryon density value from wmap data , which provide bounds on the number of additional neutrino species at bbn in the range @xmath89  @xcite .",
    "uncertainty @xmath90 corresponds to @xmath91 , so in this analysis , i have assumed that primordial @xmath3he abundance is known with an accuracy better than @xmath10 , and will call the isohelium contours corresponding to @xmath90 3% @xmath3he overproduction contours , and the obtained bbn constraints 3% @xmath3he constraints.    in fig .  2 i present the calculated cosmological constraints on oscillation parameters for the @xmath92 , and @xmath45 for the resonant ( to the left ) and the non - resonant ( to the right ) oscillation cases .",
    "the region upwards of the corresponding curves is the cosmologically excluded .",
    "the upper curve is for @xmath92 case , the lower one  for @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath18 constraints are given for comparison by the dashed contours .",
    "+ * figure 3 : * bbn constraints on oscillation parameters for the resonant ( l.h.s . ) and the non - resonant @xmath93 oscillations and for initial degrees of population of the sterile neutrino state @xmath92 and @xmath94 .",
    "the dashed contours present the constraints for @xmath18 case for comparison .",
    "+ the analysis shows that the two effects ( i ) and ( ii ) of @xmath6 , nearly compensate each other for small @xmath6 values .",
    "hence , the cosmological constraints for @xmath92 slightly differ from the ones for @xmath18 , as illustrated in fig.3 . for @xmath95 @xmath29",
    "dominates over the suppression term @xmath51 , so the constraints are strengthened . as a whole the cosmological constraints in the resonant case are slightly changed compared to the case with initially zero sterile state , while in the non - resonant case the change is more noticeable , and the constraints are becoming more stringent with the increase of @xmath6 .",
    "the precise account of the kinetic effects of oscillations on bbn , i.e. the study of the distorted spectrum distribution of neutrinos and its effect on nucleons kinetics , allows strengthening the cosmological constraints by an order of magnitude towards smaller mass differences in comparison with calculations considering just the integral effect like neutrino number density depletion .",
    "the presence of a _ non - empty _ sterile state before @xmath0 oscillations was not considered in previous cosmological constraints on oscillation parameters .",
    "this work is a step towards generalizing the cosmological constraints on oscillation parameters of neutrino .",
    "it discusses the effect of partially filled sterile state before oscillations on primordial production of @xmath3he and on the bbn oscillations constraints .",
    "it is shown that initially non - zero @xmath1 state has two fold effect on @xmath3he : on one hand it affects universe dynamics leading to overproduction of @xmath7 , while on the other hand its presence suppresses oscillations kinetic effects causing a decrease of @xmath7 overproduction .",
    "thus , depending which effect dominates , non - zero initially @xmath1 may cause strengthening or relaxation of the cosmological constraints on oscillation parameters .",
    "i have calculated the isohelium contours corresponding to @xmath10 overproduction of @xmath37he , in a model of bbn with electron  sterile oscillations effective after neutrino decoupling and for the general case of the sterile neutrino state being partially populated before oscillations , @xmath96 .",
    "the constraints become more stringent with the increase of @xmath6 value .",
    "so , the presence of non - zero initial population @xmath97 strengthens the @xmath10 @xmath37he cosmological constraints .",
    "these cosmological constraints are obtained for the case of 2-neutrino mixing .",
    "further generalization of the constraints includes the account of mixing between active neutrinos , which has been proved important in the resonant oscillation case for oscillations proceeding before neutrino decoupling  @xcite .",
    "the constraints are obtained for the natural assumption that at bbn epoch the initial lepton asymmetry is of the order of the baryon one . however ,",
    "in fact the lepton asymmetry in the neutrino sector is not strongly constrained  @xcite .",
    "we expect that , provided a small lepton asymmetry @xmath98 is present , it may be large enough to relax or alleviate the discussed bbn bounds on neutrino oscillations . for @xmath18 case it was proven that larger than @xmath99 lepton asymmetry may strongly suppress oscillations effective after neutrino decoupling and change the constraints , while initial lepton asymmetry larger than @xmath100 can alleviate them  @xcite .",
    "cosmological constraints can be relaxed also if the systematic error of @xmath7 is higher than 0.007 .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that even for @xmath101 , and a considerable initial population of @xmath1 @xmath77 , the constraints may not be removed , but just relaxed , as the results of ref .",
