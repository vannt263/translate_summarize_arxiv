    "since the discovery of strangeness , the hyperon  nucleon ( @xmath8 ) interaction has been of fundamental interest both theoretically @xcite as well as experimentally @xcite .",
    "first , its knowledge is important for the general understanding of the structure of hadrons and their constituents .",
    "further , it is also needed to explain the spectra of hypernuclei , which , in return , also convey information on these interactions especially at small relative energies .",
    "unfortunately , since hyperons are short lived , this energy region is practically inaccessible by hyperon beams .",
    "thus , possible bound states are indispensable as the source of information . in this report",
    "we will concentrate on the @xmath0 interaction at energies close to the threshold of the @xmath1 channels .",
    "these are at 2128.94 mev ( for @xmath9 ) and at 2130.9 mev ( for @xmath10 ) . in this region",
    "experimental data for elastic scattering , @xmath11 indicate an enhancement in the @xmath0 cross section as we will discuss in the next sections .",
    "however , the dynamical origin of this enhancement remains unclear so far .",
    "it could be a cusp structure due to ( and at ) the opening of the @xmath1 threshold and then would be a signal for an inelastic virtual state ( we follow here the nomenclature used and explained in ref .",
    "@xcite ) or due to a bound @xmath12 or @xmath9 state , i. e. a deuteron - like but unstable bound state . in the latter case",
    "the peak of the cross section has to be below the @xmath1 threshold . in principle",
    ", it could also be a @xmath0 resonance above the @xmath1 threshold .",
    "data from elastic scattering experiments that cover this range exist in the literature , but so far the momentum resolution of the @xmath13 beams has been insufficient to draw firm conclusions .",
    "a much more promising avenue is offered by the study of final state interactions ( _ fsi _ ) .",
    "assuming relative weakness of the pion interaction one possibility is the strangeness exchange reaction @xmath14 also strangeness production processes like @xmath15 should contain basically the same information .",
    "in this work we will concentrate on the two reactions ( [ equ : k_induced ] ) and ( [ gat : reac3 ] ) . with regard to the former reaction , evidence for an enhancement in the @xmath0 cross",
    "section near the @xmath1 threshold has been already found in the late 1960s and confirmed in later experiments @xcite .",
    "we review those data and we also re - analyze them with the aim to determine accurately the position of this enhancement .",
    "experimental information about the reaction [ gat : reac3 ] , in the region of the @xmath1 threshold , has become available much more recently and clear evidence for the presence of an enhancement at that threshold is only emerging right now .",
    "here we perform an analysis of data from the inclusive measurements of the reaction @xmath16 performed at saclay  @xcite and in jlich @xcite , respectively , and attempt to extract the enhancement and its position from those experiments too .",
    "this sort of analysis suffers from lacking precise @xmath17 _ exclusive _ data to rely on .",
    "however , as we will see , the positions determined from the two reactions ( [ equ : k_induced ] ) and ( [ gat : reac3 ] ) agree with each other , and they also coincide with the opening of the @xmath6 channel within the error bars of our analysis .",
    "we also study an additional peak ( or shoulder ) that is present in basically all the aforementioned measurements and located a few mev above the @xmath1 threshold .",
    "however , in this case it turns out that there are sizable variations of its position between reaction ( [ equ : k_induced ] ) and ( [ gat : reac3 ] ) , but even between measurements of one and the same reaction .",
    "thus , the physical significance of that peak remains unclear to some extent .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we take a look at the status of the results from elastic @xmath0 scattering .",
    "we discuss also the behavior of the @xmath0 cross section around the @xmath1 threshold as predicted by various @xmath8 interaction models from the literature . in the two subsequent sections",
    "the data for the two reactions ( [ equ : k_induced ] ) and ( [ gat : reac3 ] ) are discussed . in section 5",
    "the peak structures found are analyzed .",
    "in particular , we determine their position as seen in the various measurements for the two reactions in question .",
    "the paper ends with a summary .",
    "before discussing the situation for @xmath19 scattering let us briefly recall some well - known features of coupled - channels dynamics @xcite .",
    "conservation of flux and the associated unitarity of the @xmath20-matrix necessarily imply anomalies at the opening of new thresholds @xcite . specifically , at an @xmath20-wave threshold the cross section of the `` old '' channel as a function of the energy will , in general , have infinite slopes at such a threshold .",
    "the resulting structures are usually called cusps or rounded steps , depending on their specific shape @xcite . whether these structures remain primarily of academic interest or manifest themselves via large , experimentally observable effects depends strongly on the strengths of the interactions in the coupled channels . in particular",
    ", pronounced threshold phenomena always go along with near - by poles in the scattering amplitudes of the involved channels that are associated with ( inelastic ) virtual states or ( unstable ) bound states @xcite .",
    "modern meson - exchange models of the @xmath8 interaction such as the jlich @xcite or nijmegen potentials @xcite are derived under the assumption of ( broken ) su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "this symmetry implies , that the strongly attractive forces that yield the deuteron bound state ( in the @xmath21 partial wave ) and a virtual state in the @xmath22 partial wave in case of the @xmath23 system will likewise act in the strangeness @xmath24 sector ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for details on the su(3 ) relations ) . specifically , there is a strong coupling between the @xmath19 and @xmath1 systems .",
    "it is caused by the long - ranged tensor force provided by pion exchange and boosted by the fact that the thresholds of the two channels are only separated by 77 mev .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that practically all @xmath8 interactions that fit the data and include explicitly the coupling between the @xmath19 and @xmath1 channels predict also sizeable threshold effects .",
    "cross section as function of the center - of - mass energy .",
    "jl04 and jl89 are results for the jlich potentials published in refs . @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=47.0% ]    a closer inspection of the results for published interaction models reveals that , in general , they can be grouped into two categories . in one case",
    "the predicted @xmath19 cross section around the @xmath1 threshold is in the order of 40 to 50 mb and , more characteristic , roughly a factor four larger than a few mev away from the threshold .",
    "the cross section is so large because one of the eigenphases of the tensor - coupled @xmath7 partial wave ( in most cases the @xmath26 ) passes through 90right below the @xmath1 threshold . due to the latter aspect ,",
    "the peak of the cross section is actually not at the @xmath1 threshold but slightly below .",
    "thus , in this case the @xmath19 cross section exhibits a typical resonance - like behavior",
    ". moreover , no cusp appears at the actual @xmath1 threshold , only a rounded step @xcite .",
    "however , since the peak of the cross section occurs so close to the @xmath1 threshold  often the separation is less than an mev  it is usually impossible to recognize the above features in the published results due to the scale used for the figures !",
    "pole searches performed for the amplitudes produced by the potential models in question found that these are located in the second quadrant of the complex plane of the relative momentum in the @xmath1 channel @xcite .",
    "thus , these @xmath8 interactions are characterized by the presence of an unstable bound state , i.e. a deuteron - like @xmath1 state @xcite .",
    "the nijmegen potentials nsc97f @xcite and nf @xcite but also the original jlich @xmath8 interaction @xcite belong to this category . in the case of an unstable bound state",
    "it is also possible that the @xmath27 eigenphase passes through 90(instead of the @xmath26 ) .",
    "interestingly , such a scenario is seldom realized .",
    "in fact , we are aware of only one meson - exchange @xmath8 potential where this happens , namely the nijmegen esc04 interaction @xcite . in case of the interactions considered in @xcite",
    "it is also the @xmath27 that passes through 90 .",
    "but since these potentials were intended for application in faddeev - type calculations for simplicity reasons only @xmath20-waves were taken into account .",
    "one of the interactions considered in @xcite has the rather unique feature that the predicted @xmath27 phase passes through 90slightly above the @xmath1 threshold .",
    "as far as we can see , this does not happen for any of the meson - exchange @xmath8 potentials whose phase shifts are documented in the literature .",
    "the second category of @xmath8 potentials produces a peak in the @xmath19 cross section precisely at the @xmath1 threshold .",
    "thus , now we do observe a genuine threshold cusp . here none of the relevant eigenphases passes through 90 .",
    "in general the @xmath19 cross section at the @xmath1 threshold is roughly a factor two larger than at a few mev away from the threshold .",
    "usually , the peak values are around 20 mb , but can still reach up to 40 mb . the poles for this kind of potentials are located in the third quadrant of the complex plane of the relative momentum in the @xmath1 channel @xcite .",
    "they are an indication for the presence of inelastic virtual states @xcite , i.e. the analog of the virtual state in the @xmath23 @xmath22 partial wave .",
    "the nijmegen potentials nd @xcite , nsc89 @xcite and esc08 @xcite , and also the recent jlich @xmath8 interaction @xcite belong to this category .",
    "also a @xmath8 interaction derived at leading - order in chiral effective field theory ( eft ) @xcite predicts such a behavior .    in order to illustrate the statements made above , @xmath0",
    "cross sections for the nijmegen soft - core potentials nsc97f @xcite and nsc89 @xcite , and for the jlich potentials from 2005 @xcite and 1989 @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phases ] for energies around the @xmath1 threshold for two different energy scales .",
    "results obtained at leading - order chiral eft @xcite are indicated by the grey band .",
    "one can see that the cross sections predicted by those @xmath8 potentials indeed exhibit different features at the @xmath1 threshold . as said above the nijmegen nsc97f and",
    "the jlich 1989 one - boson exchange models produce a deuteron - like unstable bound state in the @xmath1 channel . in both cases",
    "the @xmath26 @xmath19 phase shift shows a resonance - like behavior and crosses 90slightly below the @xmath1 threshold @xcite .",
    "the rounded step in the cross section of the jl89 potential is clearly visible in the left figure ( with magnified scale ) .",

    "after the decay of the @xmath13 into two charged particles one has then three charged particles in addition to the forward going pion . therefore , the authors studied the data with charged particle multiplicity @xmath41 in these scintillators . for the width of the peak they give only upper limits .",

    "we have shown above that the lower - mass peak position coincides with the @xmath9 threshold .",
    "this would hint to a genuine cusp effect @xcite .",
    "however , the question arises to what precision the experimental missing masses are known .",
    "possible shifts in the missing mass distributions in the bubble chamber measurements were minimized by studying the chamber magnetic field , energy range relation or kinematic fits to reference reactions . in the case of the kaon beam applied by pigot",
    "@xcite the incident beam was carefully measured with the help of a magnetic spectrometer . in the proton - proton experiments the question reduces to the precision with which the accelerator beam momentum is known . in lower energy experiments at cosy jlich employing the spectrograph big karl deviations of 0.11 to",
    "0.5 mev / c were found @xcite and the cosy beam energy in later experiments was corrected for these small deviations .",
    "similarly for momenta around 1930 mev / c a deviation of 2 mev / c toward higher momenta was found @xcite .",
    "such a deviation by 2 mev / c would amount to a shift up of 0.7 mev for the hires experiment .",
    "however , no correction was found to be necessary when taking the @xmath0 threshold as benchmark @xcite .",
    "note that the demanded agreement between the hires and the spes4 data required a shift of the latter to the low energy side closer to the nominal accelerator beam momentum . from these findings",
    "we conclude that the energy scale in the data used here is reliable and therefore the lower - mass peak is at the @xmath9 threshold within two standard deviations of the experimental uncertainty .",
    "thus , there is no evidence for a resonance in the @xmath0 system below the @xmath1 threshold which in turn restricts the possibility of the existence of a strangeness @xmath24 counterpart of the deuteron @xcite .",
    "of course , nothing can be said for the region within that uncertainty so that a quasi - bound deuteron - like state extremely close to the @xmath9 threshold can not be excluded at present .",
    "we will study this possibility further .      at this stage",
    "let us emphasize that the breit - wigner distributions are used here solely as a tool to determine the peak positions of the structures seen in the various experiments and to obtain values for the widths that can be compared with each other .",
    "they are not meant as a physical interpretation of the data .",
    "there are other parameterizations that are considered to be more adequate for amplitudes near a threshold like the one proposed by flatt @xcite , specifically , if one wants to determine also the pole positions .",
    "however , those forms usually involve also more free parameters .",
    "furthermore , the finite resolution of the experiment requires that the yield should be folded with gaussians so that the functional form in the peak region would be identical anyway ( see braun et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    in any case , we performed also exploratory calculations with the relativistic formulae of flatt  @xcite . that the peak in @xmath0 occurs just at the @xmath9 threshold is no accident , if the production of the two hyperon - nucleon states are viewed as occurring via s - wave hyperon - nucleon scattering .",
    "as flatt has pointed out then the drop on the high - mass side may be interpreted as the effect of the opening of the @xmath9 channel operating through unitarity .",
    "but the imposition of analyticity requires that the presence of the @xmath9 channel must be felt below threshold as well , thus creating the rapid decrease in the @xmath0 cross section on the low - mass side of the peak .",
    "the differential cross section around the @xmath9 threshold is then @xmath75 with @xmath76 denoting @xmath77 and @xmath78 denoting @xmath79 .",

    "@xmath85 is the mass of the resonance and @xmath86 the partial width into the incoming channel .",
    "it is usually assumed to be weakly momentum dependent and thus can be assumed to be constant  @xcite .",
    "for the other channel we have @xmath87 with @xmath88 the @xmath9 c.m .",
    "momentum . above the @xmath9 threshold @xmath88 is real but below the threshold it becomes purely imaginary so that @xmath89 with @xmath90",
    ". in this region the cross section is given by @xmath91 while @xmath92 .",
    "in the actual calculations we assumed that @xmath93 . in practice , @xmath86 can be absorbed into the overall normalization factor @xmath84 .",
    "it turned out that the fits are not sensitive to the resonance parameters , something that was also seen already by braun et al .",
    "@xcite when analyzing their own data .",
    "thus , it seems difficult to learn more on the pole position .",
    "therefore , we kept those parameters fixed to reproduce a peak at the ( @xmath6 ) threshold and fitted only the other parameters ( couplings and an overall normalization ) . in addition",
    "we assumed a gaussian smearing with a fitted width to take into account the finite resolution of the different experiments .",
    "although there is a large variation in the obtained values , the ratios of the coupling constants are better defined .",
    "indeed , this is just a reflection of the scaling properties of the flatt parametrization discussed in ref .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that the final curves due to the folding with the gaussian resolution function are quite similar to breit - wigner functions .    the standard flatt parametrization eq .",
    "( [ gat : above ] ) produces only a single peak .",
    "it can not generate the secondary peak ( or shoulder ) seen in the data . in order to account for this component",
    "we have coherently added a breit - wigner function . however , in the actual fit procedure the centroid of the breit - wigner is always moved to the maximum while simultaneously the flatt part is reduced .",
    "the fits now show a wider distribution but with almost no interference .",
    "it should be stressed that the assumed flatt formalism is only for a coupled two - channel system . in the discussed @xmath4 system",
    "there is also a tensor coupling between the @xmath27 and @xmath26 partial waves so that effectively , one deals with a system of four coupled channels and one would need to use a suitably generalized form for the flatt parameterizations @xcite .      in the case of the second structure , which in most of the data sets looks like a shoulder , there is no near - by threshold .",
    "therefore one possible explanation is indeed that there could be a genuine resonance in the @xmath0 system .",
    "however , such structures could be also artefacts of the cuts applied to the data from the @xmath33 reaction in order to exclude events from processes with the proton being a spectator .",
    "the momentum distribution of the nucleons in the deuteron is asymmetric with respect to its mean , say a hulthn function with a maximum at 50 mev / c .",
