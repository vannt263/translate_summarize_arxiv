    "these observations were made from 1st to 3rd january 2005 at the iram-30 m telescope .",
    "we used the hera ( heterodyne receiver array ) , a focal array of 18 sis receivers , 9 for each polarisation , tuned at the co(2 - 1 ) line , for ngc 1275 ( 226.56 ghz ) .",
    "the sampling was 6 arsec ( full sampling ) .",
    "we built four such maps , covering the central 138x138@xmath0 , and also a 5th one covering 66x66@xmath0 towards the north .",
    "figure [ figure1 ] shows in contours the co(2 - 1 ) emission , overlaid on a halpha image of the filamentary structure pointed out by conselice et al .",
    "the co contours appear to surround a northern radio lobe cavity , also traced in the x - ray gas .",
    "the hot gas , compressed towards the rims , cools there more efficiently , which could explain the presence of co gas .",
    "the kinematics deduced from the co spectra is not regular , and it is not possible to follow a rotational pattern . the mass of cold gas found here ( 4 10@xmath1 m@xmath2 ) is quite a large amount for a single galaxy .",
    "so , it is likely that we see here , for the first time , a filamentary cold gas coming from a cooling flow as predicted by x - ray observations ."

    "<S> this object is the strongest cooling flow emitter in the millimeter . </S>",
    "<S> the 9 dual polarization pixels of the hera focal plane array , installed on the 30 m telescope , enabled to image the large scale emission of the cold molecular gas which is found to follow the very peculiar halpha filamentary structure around the central galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss here this association and the non - rotating dynamics of the cold gas that argue for a cooling flow origin of the molecular component . </S>"
