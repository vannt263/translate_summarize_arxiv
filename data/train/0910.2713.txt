    "in recent years , theoretical and experimental investigation has been focused on the engineering of highly nonclassical , non - gaussian states of the radiation field ( for a review , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "interest in the production of non - gaussian optical states is due to their strongly nonclassical properties , such as entanglement and negativity of the quasi - probability phase - space distributions , that are important for the efficient implementation of quantum information and communication protocols @xcite , and for quantum estimation tasks @xcite .",
    "several schemes for the generation of non - gaussian states , both single - mode and two - mode , have already been proposed @xcite , and many successful and encouraging experimental realizations have been reported recently @xcite . in line of principle , a very important result concerns the rigorous proof that various nonclassical properties are minimized by gaussian states @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to expect that the use of non - gaussian resources may improve significantly the performance of quantum information protocols . in particular",
    ", concerning quantum teleportation with continuous variables ( cv ) , it has been shown that the success probability of teleportation can be greatly increased by using entangled non - gaussian resources in the framework of the ideal braunstein - kimble ( b - k ) protocol @xcite .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that some specific two - mode non - gaussian states , dubbed squeezed bell - like states ( that include as subcases photon - added and photon - subtracted de - gaussified states @xcite ) , when used as entangled resources provide a significant increase in the teleportation fidelity of single - mode input states under the ideal protocol @xcite .",
    "such an enhancement is due to a balancing of three different features @xcite : the entanglement content of the resources , their ( appropriately defined ) degree of affinity with the two - mode squeezed vacuum , and their ( suitably measured ) amount of non - gaussianity . for the precise definition of the last two quantities , see refs .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that such states can be produced by combining simultaneous phase - matched multiphoton processes and conditional measurements .",
    "the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite has been later extended to consider other classes of non - gaussian resources , such as two - mode squeezed symmetric superpositions of fock states and of squeezed cat - like states , that allow high levels of performance in the teleportation of single - mode input states @xcite .",
    "a partial preliminary analysis of non - ideal cases has also been performed @xcite by considering simple superpositions of independently generated fields converging on a common spatial volume , such as superpositions of a two - mode pure non - gaussian resource and a two - mode thermal state @xcite . in this elementary instance , mixed non - gaussian entangled states remain preferred resources for teleportation when compared to mixed twin - beam gaussian states @xcite .",
    "+ in this work , using the formalism of the characteristic function , we study in full generality the braunstein - kimble protocol for cv teleportation in realistic conditions and with non - gaussian entangled resources .",
    "we include in our investigation the main sources of decoherence that lead to the degradation of the transferred quantum information , such as losses due to imperfect homodyne measurements , and damping due to the propagation of the optical fields in lossy fibers .",
    "the effects of these inefficiencies have already been considered , among others , in refs .",
    "@xcite . in particular ref .",
    "@xcite is concerned with the study of imperfect bell measurements , while in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors investigate the limits of quantum teleportation due to photon absorption during propagation in fibers .",
    "besides considering each problem separately , these and related works are always restricted to the use of gaussian resources .",
    "the main object of the present work is to investigate the effect of the simultaneous presence of all sources of imperfection on the performance of cv teleportation protocols with non - gaussian resources , and their robustness against decoherence .",
    "a general and exhaustive analysis turns out to be possible in the framework of the characteristic function representation .",
    "this method has been discussed in full generality for the description of ideal cv teleportation @xcite , and applied first to the case of gaussian @xcite and non - gaussian resources @xcite .",
    "we will then extend the formalism to include the description of nonideal cv teleportation , including realistic bell measurements and decoherence due to propagation in noisy channels . in order to investigate different optimization strategies of the nonideal protocol",
    ", we will discuss optimization over the free parameters of the non - gaussian resources as well as over the gain factor associated with the transmitted classical information @xcite ( for various strategies of gain tuning and of optimal gain see also refs .",
    "indeed , in the instance of non - gaussian resources , the gain can be considered as a further free parameter suitable for optimization .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ seccharfunctelep ]",
    "we extend the characteristic function formalism to include the case of realistic cv quantum teleportation . in section  [ secentangres ]",
    "we introduce and discuss the main properties of some classes of non - gaussian entangled resources . in section  [ secunitygain ]",
    "we study the efficiency of the quantum teleportation protocol in the instance of fixed given values of the gain . in section  [ secnonunitygain ]",
    "we carry out an optimization procedure of the protocol over the entangled resources and the gain parameter .",
    "finally , in section [ secconclusions ] we draw our conclusions and discuss some outlook on current and future research .",
    "in this section , we describe the realistic b - k cv teleportation protocol in the formalism of the characteristic function .",
    "although several alternative formalisms are available for the description of the b - k cv teleportation protocol @xcite , the characteristic function representation proves to be particularly convenient when considering the nonideal case and non - gaussian resources .",
    "the description of nonideal teleportation requires the introduction of mechanisms of loss and inefficiency in the main steps of the protocol .",
    "indeed , a schematic description of the nonideal protocol is depicted in fig .",

    ", such inefficiency is simulated by the introduction of two fictitious beam splitters @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with equal transmissivity @xmath2.,width=321 ]    the input state and the entangled resource states are assumed to be initially pure .",
    "this is not a serious limitation because one can always map the case of a nonideal teleportation protocol with noisy ( mixed ) inputs and resources to an equivalent protocol with pure inputs and resources but with a correspondingly larger amount of noise affecting the protocol .",
    "a simple illustrative example of this equivalence will be discussed later on in the present work .",
    "the single - mode input state ( @xmath3 ) is mixed to mode @xmath4 of the entangled resource at a beam splitter . at the first user s ( alice ) location , a bell measurement , consisting in homodyne detections ,",
    "is performed on the obtained state of mode @xmath3 and mode @xmath4 . in order to describe a nonideal measurement , one needs to model / simulate the inefficiencies of the photo - detectors .",
    "a realistic detector can be modeled by placing a fictitious beam splitter , i.e. a partly transmitting mirror , in front of an ideal detector @xcite .",
    "based on such a prescription , a scheme describing a realistic bell measurement is shown in fig .",
    "[ figrealquanttel2 ] .    after a realistic bell measurement , the result",
    "is transmitted to the receiver ( bob ) through a classical channel .",
    "the mode @xmath5 of the entangled resource propagates in a noisy channel , as a lossy fiber , to bob s location , where it undergoes a unitary displacement according the result of the bell measurement it is important to note that the generation of the entangled resource can take place close to the sender , and typically very far away from the receiver , as one of the main tasks of quantum teleportation is the transfer of quantum information across long distances .",
    "it is then legitimate to assume that the radiation field associated to mode @xmath4 is not affected by losses due to propagation , while the field associated to mode @xmath5 , which usually has to propagate over much longer distances , can be strongly affected by decoherence .",
    "the degradation of quantum information is caused by the propagation of field mode @xmath5 in a noisy channel .",
    "therefore , the output teleported state depends both on the inefficiency of the homodyne detectors and the decoherence rate of the noisy channel .",

    "the characteristic function can be written in terms of @xmath21 , @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath23 .",

    "it is necessary to perform a simultaneous balanced optimization , on the free parameters ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 ) , of some partially competing properties @xcite .",
    "these include the entanglement content , the amount of non - gaussianity of the state @xcite , and a squeezed - vacuum - affinity @xmath68 . for a generic pure state @xmath69 ,",
    "the latter is defined as @xcite : @xmath70 with @xmath71 .",
    "indeed , the optimal non - gaussian resources ( [ squeezbell ] ) and ( [ squeezcat ] ) exhibit a sufficient squeezed - vacuum - affinity , which then appears to be a crucially needed property in order to select efficient and highly performing non - gaussian resources . for instance , one could as well consider a different form of squeezed bell - like state , the so - called `` buridan donkey '' or `` hamlet '' state @xmath72 , that is obtained from the singlet bell state as follows : @xmath73 it is indeed simple to verify that , although such a state , at fixed squeezing , is more entangled than a gaussian twin beam , it performs less efficiently both in the ideal and in the realistic teleportation protocol .",
    "this fact can be understood if one looks at the behavior of the squeezed vacuum affinity @xcite .",
    "namely , the buridan donkey state eq .",
    "( [ squeezbell2 ] ) does not contain the fundamental gaussian contribution coming from the squeezed vacuum .",
    "therefore , it is  unbalanced  , in the sense that it is less affine to the squeezed vacuum , and excessively non - gaussian compared to the optimized bell - like state @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , the fine interplay among these three quantities , i.e. the entanglement , the degree of non - gaussianity , and , in particular , the squeezed vacuum affinity , can not be realized in the non - gaussian resource ( [ squeezbell2 ] ) @xcite . the crucial role played by the squeezed vacuum affinity for the performance of different non - gaussian resources",
    "has been studied in ref .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that , in the ideal teleportation protocol , the two - mode squeezed symmetric superposition of fock states , i.e. @xmath74 , when optimized for the teleportation of both input coherent states and single - photon states , reduces to a squeezed truncated twin beam , i.e. @xmath75 . in the same paper , it has been also shown that , in the ideal teleportation protocol , the optimized two - mode squeezed cat - like states , i.e. eq .  ( [ squeezcat ] ) , possess a high amount of squeezed vacuum affinity . therefore , besides a certain amount of entanglement , also a sufficient degree of squeezed vacuum affinity appears to be necessary for a non - gaussian resource to be optimal for a b - k teleportation protocol .",
    "clearly , the performance of b - k teleportation protocols depends strongly on the structure of the second - order correlations in the entangled resources . in this sense the b - k protocol , with its structure of homodyne measurements , is particularly tailored to the use of gaussian resources .",
    "therefore , a non - gaussian resource may improve on the performance of a corresponding gaussian one only if the fundamental gaussian contribution coming from the squeezed vacuum is subject to a not too drastic modification .",
    "a large value of the affinity assures that the non - gaussian resource satisfies such a requirement .",
    "the interplay of the affinity with the non - gaussianity and the degree of entanglement allows to single out those non - gaussian resources possessing higher - order correlations that add to the leading gaussian structure of the two - mode entangled resource , thus enhancing further the protocol efficiency , and lacking those non - gaussian contributions that are incompatible with the structure of the b - k protocol .    indeed , a very interesting question open for future investigation is the inverse of the one studied in the present paper .",
    "here we are analyzing the problem of optimizing non - gaussian resources given the b - k protocol .",
    "the inverse question would be that of adapting the protocol to the resources .",
    "namely , given a certain class of non - gaussian squeezed resources with some given properties , one asks how the b - k protocol would have to be modified in order to optimize the fidelity of teleportation .",
    "we now proceed to determine the general expression of the fidelity of teleportation in terms of the characteristic function for the three different non - gaussian entangled resources @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath72 .",
