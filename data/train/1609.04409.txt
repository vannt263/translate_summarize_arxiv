    "star formation in galaxies occurs in dense molecular environments and is governed by the complex interaction of gravity , magnetic fields , turbulence , and radiation pressure @xcite . despite decades of study , the fundamental conditions behind the transition of diffuse atomic gas to cold molecular gas are still relatively unconstrained @xcite . the initial conditions imprinted on the diffuse and molecular gas on parsec scales ( i.e. the level of turbulence , the cloud density",
    ", the structure of the magnetic field ) may determine the key properties of the initial mass function ( imf ) and the star formation rates in galaxies @xcite .",
    "therefore the properties of diffuse and molecular gas in and around star - forming clouds must be quantified in order to construct a theory of star formation that predicts the imf .",
    "the density and column density probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) have been used extensively in understanding the properties of galactic gas dynamics , from the diffuse ionized medium to dense star - forming clouds .",
    "the application of the pdf in molecular clouds has included density tracers such as co @xcite and dust @xcite .",
    "tracing the pdf using dust emission and absorption provides the largest dynamic range of densities , in contrast to molecular line tracers such as co , which suffer from depletion and opacity effects @xcite .",
    "simulations of self - gravitating mhd turbulence have successfully reproduced the shape and properties of the observational pdfs @xcite suggesting that the gas pdf stems from a combination of turbulence ( which induces a lognormal pdf shape in density ) and self - gravity ( which is characterized by a power - law pdf in density ) . in more detail , observed and simulated pdfs of giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) environments , which include supersonic turbulence and self - gravity , suggest that the highest column density regime of the pdf ( i.e. , above column densities of 1 a@xmath1 ) has a power - law distribution @xcite while the lower column density material in the pdf is dominated by turbulent diffuse gas and takes on a lognormal form @xcite .",
    "the implications for the shape of the gas density pdf in ism clouds are profoundly linked to the kinematics , star formation rates and the chemistry of the gas @xcite .",
    "kinematically , the pdf width of the lognormal density distribution can be related to the sonic mach number of the gas in an isothermal cloud @xcite .",
    "star formation rates are linked to the gas density pdf in several analytic models which use the high density end of the pdf to provide the dense gas fraction to calculate star formation efficiencies @xcite .",
    "more recently , the hi pdf in and around gmcs has been proposed as a tracer of the hi - h@xmath2 transition @xcite as well as a more accurate tracer of the low density lognormal shape as opposed to dust emission / absorption data , which have difficulty tracing the lognormal form @xcite . @xcite and @xcite have shown that the lognormal portion of the column density pdf in a sample of milky way gmcs is comprised of mostly atomic hi gas while the power - law tail is built up by the molecular h@xmath2 .",
    "these studies suggest that the transition point in the column density pdf between the lognormal and power - law portions of the column density pdf traces important physical processes , such as the hi - h@xmath2 transition and the density regime where self - gravity becomes dynamically important .    in this work",
    "we derive an analytic formula for the transitional column density from the lognormal portion of the pdf to the power - law form ( denoted @xmath0 ) .",
    "we organize the paper as follows . in section 2",
    "we derive an expression for the transitional column density for a piecewise lognormal and power - law pdf distribution based on the assumption that the pdf is continuous and differentiable .",
    "we further demonstrate that @xmath0 is related to the physical parameters such as the sonic mach number of the gas ( i.e. kinematics ) , the post - shock density , and the power - law index for a self - gravitating isothermal sphere . in section 3",
    "we compare our analytic expression for the transitional column density to numerical simulations of self - gravitating mhd turbulence run using the enzo code . in section 4",
    "we compare our analytic expression for the transitional column density to observations using data from the literature . in section 5",
    "we discuss our results , followed by our conclusions in section 6 .",
    "the lognormal pdf of the gas column density is defined as @xmath3 with @xmath4 the logarithm of the normalized column density : @xmath5    the pdf is a normal distribution in @xmath4 , meaning that it is a lognormal distribution in @xmath6 .",
    "the quantities @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote , respectively , the mean column density and mean logarithmic column density , the latter of which can be related to the standard deviation @xmath9 by : @xmath10    the lognormal form of the pdf of column density describes the behavior of diffuse hi and ionized gas @xcite as well as some star - forming molecular clouds that are not actively star - forming , e.g. see @xcite .",
    "the pdf of the highest column density regime of self - gravitating turbulent clouds has a power - law distribution as demonstrated in numerical simulations @xcite and observations @xcite    based on the aforementioned numerical and observational studies , hereafter we consider a piece - wise form for the pdf of column density ( similar to the assumption of collins et al .",

    "we note that the solution to the transition point should be applicable ( and take the same form ) for both density ( see collins et al .",
    "2012 ) and column density distributions since both density and column density share the same lognormal + power - law form of the pdf . in the following subsection",
    "we provide a physical interpretation for @xmath0 .",
    "the transitional column density @xmath0 is not necessarily a criterion for a critical star - formation density , which most likely is farther out in the power - law tail .",
    "rather , @xmath0 represents a transitional point between the dominance of supersonic turbulence in the cloud gas dynamics , which builds the lognormal distribution , to densities where gravity plays an increasingly important role in shaping the distribution .",
    "given the analytic solution for the transition point of the pdf between the lognormal and power - law tail we are now in a position to relate the properties of the transition point to the physics of the gas in a gmc .",
    "the width of the lognormal pdf ( @xmath9 ) depends on the properties of the turbulence in the gmc , with the primary dependence being on the sonic mach number . for column density maps @xcite",
    "relate the sonic mach number to pdf width as :    @xmath24 \\label{eqn.sigma}\\ ] ]    @xmath25 is a scaling constant from density to column density .",

    "equation [ eqn.sigma ] was shown to depend very weakly on the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "for the 3d density pdf in super - alfvnic turbulence , @xcite formulated the dependency on the plasma @xmath29 , i.e. the ratio of the gas pressure to magnetic pressure , as    @xmath30 \\label{eqn.beta}\\ ] ]    for the case of the column density , we can thus express the transition point in terms of the sonic mach number by combining equations [ eqn.st ] and [ eqn.sigma ] to find @xmath31 ) \\label{eqn.rho0}\\ ] ]    the transition density or column density can be further expressed in terms of the post - shock density , @xmath32 , which is the density at which the turbulent energy density is equal to the thermal pressure : @xmath33 manipulating this relation we find that @xmath34 , meaning equation [ eqn.rho0 ] becomes @xmath35 \\label{eqn.rho00}\\ ] ]    in the limit of strong collapse , @xmath36 tends to 1.5 ( see figure [ fig : slopevtime ] ) , so the @xmath37 term is of order unity .",
    "therefore , @xmath38 \\label{eqn.rho1}\\ ] ] and so @xmath39    in the case of a 3d density field ( relevant for simulations ) we can express the transition density in the same form at the column density ( i.e. using equation [ eqn.st ] ) the transition density can be expressed ( using equation [ eqn.beta ] ) as :    @xmath40    as the exponent @xmath41 in equation [ eqn.rho2 ] accounts for line - of - sight ( los ) effects and radiative transfer in column density ( see burkhart et al .",

    "it depends on the collapse state of the gas , the magnetic pressure , and the los @xcite .",

    "the relation between these quantities is also derived in @xcite , their equation 43 . ]    in the case where the tail is produced only due to gravitational collapse , and if we assume spherical symmetry , the pdf slope of the power - law tail is related to the exponent @xmath42 of the radial density profile @xmath43 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we are now in a position to test the analytic relation for the transitional column density given in equation [ eqn.st ] . for this purpose",

    "we project the 3d density into column density along three different lines of sight ( denoted @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) .",
    "a histogram is then generated of the logarithm of the normalized column density , i.e. , @xmath74 .",
    "based on previous numerical studies ( e.g. , collins et al .",
    "2012 ; burkhart et al . 2015 ) and the form of the pdf presented in equation [ eqn.piecewise ] , we expect these simulations to show a lognormal column density pdf around the mean column density with a power - law tail developing at higher densities .",
    "we fit a lognormal to column densities within 20 percent of the peak of the distribution ( to minimize contamination from the tail ) and a power - law in the higher density regions where the lognormal fit begins to fail .",
    "we show the pdf and the lognormal fits of the simulated column density at snapshot t=@xmath75 in figure [ fig : pdfs ] . the width of the lognormal @xmath76 and power - law slope @xmath22 are determined as free parameters of the fits while the transition point @xmath77 of the pdf is determined by finding where the least squares between the power - law fit and the data gets better than that of the lognormal fit . in figure",

    "recent studies have suggested that the pdf of molecular line tracers and dust tracers is of power - law form@xcite while the neutral diffuse hi builds up most of the lognormal portion of the pdf @xcite . in light of these recent studies , the hi lognormal pdf and h@xmath2 power - law tail pdf",
    "may be effectively distinguished by the transition point between the two distributions .",
    "the truncation of the hi lognormal roughly corresponds to the hi - h@xmath2 transitional column density in galactic star - forming clouds@xcite which suggests that measuring the transitional column density in such clouds could provide constraints on the hi - h@xmath2 transition .",
    "the transitional column density is approximately @xmath95 ( i.e. @xmath96 ) which is in the range of the typically quoted hi - h2 transition value of approximately @xmath97@xcite .",
    "an example of this is recent observations of the perseus molecular cloud , which find a hi - h@xmath2 transitional column density of @xmath98      recently several authors @xcite have noted that dust emission and extinction are problematic probes of the low column density material in molecular clouds .",
    "this is because the observed pdf of dust can suffer several biases including resolution , noise , boundary effects and line - of - sight contamination .",
    "@xcite pointed out that while the lognormal portion of the pdf can not be securely traced by dust , the characteristic break in the power - law regime at low values of extinction / column density ( i.e. @xmath0 ) is still unaffected by observational biases .",
    "these studies suggest that @xmath0 is a robust observational quantity , even though the properties of the lognormal pdf , such as the width of the lognormal , are not possible to accurately observe in dust tracers . using our analytic expression for @xmath0",
    "it is therefore possible to estimate the lognormal width of the distribution by measuring the power - law tail slope and value of s@xmath99 .",
    "the shape of the low - density portion of the pdf provides an important constraint on the initial conditions of star - forming clouds ( i.e. the strength of turbulence and comparison to numerical studies ) and therefore it is important to quantify this observationally .",
    "incidentally , the difficulty of constraining the width of the pdf may be the reason that our predicted value for @xmath0 differs by about @xmath94 from the herschel observations reported in table 1 ( schneider et al .",
    "2015 ) , since our prediction depends on the width of the pdf .",
    "since the measured values of @xmath22 ( slope of the power - law ) and @xmath0 should be robust to observational effects , these two quantities should be used to measure the lognormal width @xmath91 , rather than fitting @xmath91 directly from observations .",
    "the transition point between the turbulence - dominated ( lognormal ) portion of the pdf and the denser , self - gravitating ( power - law ) portion of the pdf is an important component of the star - formation process . in this paper",
    "we derived an analytic expression for the transitional point ( @xmath0 ) of the column density pdf from a lognormal to a power - law .      *",
    "the expression for @xmath0 depends on the mean column density , width of the lognormal portion of the pdf ( i.e. the sonic mach number and driving parameter ) and the slope of the power - law portion of the pdf ( i.e. power - law index for a self - gravitating isothermal sphere ) * in the limit of strong collapse , @xmath0 represents the post - shock density given by the balance of turbulent and thermal pressure . *",
    "the values predicted by the analytic expression for @xmath0 agree well with measurements from herschel dust observations and enzo amr simulations .",
