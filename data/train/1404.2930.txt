    "many observational studies have measured dark matter halo masses in order to find correlations with the properties of the galaxies they host .",
    "various works have utilized gravitational lensing of background objects @xcite , virial temperatures derived from x - rays and dynamics of satellites @xcite .",
    "these methods have achieved high accuracy , but are also observationally expensive to carry out on large samples and for small haloes , which limits the statistical strength and range of application .",
    "a less direct but more comprehensive method of linking galaxies to haloes is abundance matching , which uses the merger trees from @xmath10-body dark matter simulations as input and assumes that the halo mass is the main determinant of galaxy luminosity and stellar mass .",
    "the basic idea is to cumulatively match observed galaxy luminosity functions and halo mass functions by placing progressively less luminous galaxies in less massive haloes . by design",
    ", this method reproduces the luminosity ( or stellar mass ) function , and is able to predict the clustering of galaxies in many cases @xcite .",
    "+ direct measurements of galaxy clustering are another powerful way to connect galaxies with the underlying dark matter distribution . as a function of physical separation @xmath11 , clustering is commonly measured in the form of the two - point spatial correlation function @xmath12 ( scf ; peebles 1980 ) .",
    "the relation between the distributions of galaxies and dark matter can be parametrized through the galaxy bias @xmath13 , which is given by the scaling between the scfs of these two fields : @xmath14 the scf of dark matter depends on the cosmology , and can be prescribed analytically given those parameters @xcite . thus",
    ", the bias of a galaxy sample is directly determined by its scf . in general",
    ", the bias depends on the spatial scale and redshift @xcite , since galaxies and dark matter do not evolve in the exact same manner in time or space .",
    "the measurement of @xmath15 can therefore reveal a precise description of the connection between galaxies and dark matter .",
    "+ many studies up to intermediate redshifts ( @xmath16 ) have investigated galaxy clustering with samples selected in different ways @xcite .",
    "the most common conclusion is that clustering strength is correlated with luminosity , red color and morphology ( towards early - type ) .",
    "galaxies on the extreme of these properties are highly biased and therefore they live in massive haloes .",
    "+ these conclusions can be obtained just by analyzing the overall amplitude of the bias .",
    "however , the precise form of this observable as a function of spatial separation contains more information about the inner structure of the haloes .",
    "the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) is a simple parametric framework to accurately model the bias .",
    "it considers galaxies to be either centrals or satellites , and the number of these that a halo can host is fully determined by the halo mass .",
    "+ one of the advantages of the hod framework is that its parameters have a clear physical meaning , and thus when fitting the clustering one can gain a deeper insight into the connection between the galaxies and their host haloes .",
    "for example , the hod framework can directly relate the average stellar mass of the central galaxies to a particular halo mass .",
    "as shown in many studies at @xmath17 , the ratio of these masses is highest around a halo mass of @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "this implies that there is a characteristic halo mass where galaxy formation has been more efficient .",
    "the qualitative explanation for this is that at low halo masses the gravitational potential is not deep enough to halt the expulsion of gas due to stellar winds @xcite , while high - mass haloes have heated up the intra - halo medium by gravitational heating and agn feedback @xcite so that infalling gas gets heavily shocked and can not easily cool and condense .",
    "these two trends can be reduced to a comparison between dynamical and gas cooling times in haloes , such that @xmath19 for low masses and @xmath20 for high - masses .",
    "a possible consequence is that the peak halo mass @xmath21 is related to a characteristic quenching mass @xmath22 that sets @xmath23 @xcite and marks a transition between star forming and quenched haloes . indeed",
    ", massive red galaxies with little star formation have been shown to live in massive haloes @xcite , supporting the idea of the red sequence of galaxies arising when they become quenched @xcite .",
    "this blue / red dichotomy is present in the nearby universe @xcite , and starts its build - up around @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "thus , when haloes become large enough , they quench their star formation .",
    "a consequence of this is that the most massive galaxies today have no significant ongoing star formation .",
    "this effect has been called archeological downsizing @xcite , and is also inferred from the lack of evolution in the massive end of the stellar mass function @xcite .",
    "hod models have shown that the stellar - to - halo mass ratio ( shmr ) evolves in the sense that the peak moves to lower halo masses with increasing time , at least since @xmath25 @xcite . this trend has been predicted to persist up to @xmath26 by extensions of hod that use conditional stellar mass functions @xcite and abundance matching studies @xcite . a possible mechanism for this would involve evolution in @xmath22 , which is supported by the idea that the universal gas fraction drops with time and",
    "therefore star formation becomes more difficult with time at fixed halo mass @xcite .",
    "however , this is still a matter of debate .",
    "for instance , @xcite present evidence in favor of this evolution being set by quenching below a critical galaxy - halo mass ratio instead of a critical halo mass .",
    "such a mechanism would also shift the shmr toward lower masses with time .",
    "+ we have described the basic processes that can determine @xmath21 , based on the comparison of @xmath27 and @xmath28 as a function of halo mass .",
    "this basic model can be extended to include modes of galactic outflows , which are then directly constrained by the observed slope of the shmr .",
    "the stellar mass growth of a galaxy is heavily regulated by the expulsion of gas , which could be mainly sourced by supernovae feedback @xcite .",
    "the stellar mass loss rate , @xmath29 , can be broken down in two contributions : pressure - supported energy injection ( energy - driven winds ) and coherent momentum transfer ( momentum - driven winds ) .",
    "the energy and momentum deposition rates , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , can be related from first principles to the mass via a proxy of the kinetic velocity field , @xmath32 : @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "this suggests that galaxies with low velocity fields , and therefore low masses , may have their outflows dominated by energy - driven winds @xcite .",
    "thus , a larger contribution from this type of wind would result in a steeper low mass slope of the shmr .",
    "+ at high masses ( and high @xmath32 ) , these arguments would point to a dominance of momentum - driven winds",
    ". however , the winds in this regime are also sourced by radiative agn feedback , which is expected to have a strong contribution @xcite .",
    "in addition , a large merger rate between central galaxies will result in a flattening of the shmr @xcite .",
    "with all these processes at play , the high - mass slope is less straightforward to interpret than the low - mass one , but it can still offer important constraints on this combination of mechanisms .",
    "+ galaxy clustering combined with hod modeling provide particularly solid measurements of the shmr whenever the selection of galaxies spans the relevant range of stellar masses . at @xmath35 ,",
    "such measurements have proven to be very difficult given the lack of large volume - limited samples . @xcite",
    "use the 0.25 deg@xmath0 newfirm survey @xcite , but the low number statistics made it difficult to map the turnover of the shmr . in this study , we use a 94 deg@xmath0 mid - infrared survey to select galaxies with stellar masses ranging from @xmath2 and fit an hod model to the angular correlation function .",
    "we present the most robust measurement to date of the peak of the shmr at @xmath9 .",
    "+ in addition , the hod yields particularly strong constraints on the satellite population of a given galaxy sample .",
    "we determine what fraction of the galaxies are satellites , and how the abundance of these depends on the halo mass .",
    "moreover , we measure a proxy for the occurrence of galaxy pairs of similar mass , and find that it mildly decreases toward high luminosities .",
    "although we do not achieve a robust detection , this represents the opposite trend to what is seen at low - redshift .",
    "the processes that produce this relationship are strongly tied to the accretion and merger events between galaxies and haloes , as well as the quenching of star formation in satellites .",

    "our main dataset is the _",
    "south pole telescope deep - field survey ( ssdf ; ashby et al .",
    "2013b ) , a 93.8 deg@xmath0 photometric survey using the irac 3.6 and 4.5@xmath42 m bands ( hereafter [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] ) .",
    "the mosaics have a nominal integration time of 120 seconds .",
    "we used source extractor ( sextractor ; bertin & arnouts 1996 ) in dual image mode , detecting galaxies in [ 4.5 ] and extracting the flux from fixed 4@xmath43  apertures in both irac channels .",
    "these aperture fluxes were then corrected to total fluxes using growth curves from isolated point sources found in the mosaics .",
    "a detailed description of the survey and a public photometric catalog are presented in @xcite .",
    "however , here we use a deeper private catalog and account for faint - end photometric bias and detection completeness ( see appendix a ) . we determine the 5@xmath44 limit in [ 4.5 ] to be 18.19 mag , in agreement with @xcite . + we use the near - infrared 2mass point source catalog @xcite to identify and remove sources brighter than @xmath45 mag , most of which are likely to be stars .",
    "in addition , we visually inspected some of these sources in the irac mosaics and determined an empirical relation between their @xmath46-band magnitude and the maximum radius where their 4.5@xmath42 m flux caused a clear suppresion in the detection of nearby sources .",
    "this relation was then applied to the rest of the @xmath46-selected sample and the resulting radii were used to mask all ssdf sources enclosed within from the main catalog . for reference ,",
    "the radii corresponding to @xmath47 and @xmath45 sources were 41@xmath43  and 8.4@xmath43 respectively .",
    "we also masked out low coverage gaps in the survey , yielding a final effective area of 88.8 deg@xmath0 .",
    "+ finally , in order to better understand the redshift distribution of our irac - selected sample in the ssdf , we use public catalogs in two other regions of the sky : the cosmos - ultravista field ( hereafter cosmos , muzzin et al .",
    "2013 ) and the extended groth strip ( hereafter egs , barro et al . 2011a , b ) .",
    "these two surveys have publically accessible irac photometry , photometric redshifts , and stellar masses . in the following section we describe how we used these catalogs to infer the redshift and mass distributions of ssdf samples .",
    "this study requires knowledge of the redshift and stellar mass distribution of the ssdf galaxy sample .",
    "however , our main dataset is too limited to obtain reliable values for these observables .",
    "therefore , the strategy is to import this information from a reference survey that contains optical data and irac photometry with a higher accuracy .",
    "we consider the catalogs from cosmos and egs , which include photometric redshifts and stellar masses .",

    "this difference is comparable to or smaller than the photometric errors ( see fig .",

    "thus , the associated systematic bias due to the color selection will be small compared to the photometric errors and intrinsic scatter in galaxy colors , and can be neglected for the current analysis .",

    "the first of these cuts imposes an upper magnitude limit at the 80% completeness level ( see appendix [ s_completeness ] ) , and the second is tuned to select galaxies at high - redshift while avoiding agn .",

    "this correlation is strong between neighboring samples , but not dominant otherwise . due to the steep variation of the stellar mass function , any given sample is mostly comprised by galaxies close to its low - mass threshold , making their clustering less sensitive to the most massive population ( see matsuoka et al . 2011 ) .",
    "+ the photometric scatter increases for fainter samples .",

    "in general , the samples consist of a @xmath93 population that has approximately the same absolute luminosity and stellar mass ( see section [ ss_stellarmasses ] ) , plus a @xmath94 contribution of `` contaminant '' galaxies that are intrinsically much less luminous .",
    "these contaminants represent 12% ( 37% ) of all galaxies in our full ( brightest ) sample .",

    "we estimated the completeness directly from the distribution of @xmath228 magnitudes from the sc catalog , shown in the lower panel of figure [ sclf ] .",
    "this distribution , @xmath236 , was assumed to obey a power - law ( schechter 1976 ) that is supressed at the faint end by the completeness function :    @xmath237    here , @xmath238 and @xmath239 are the power - law coefficients and @xmath240 @xmath241 where @xmath242 and @xmath243 are parameters that control the shape of the error function .",
    "we fit @xmath244 to the sc data .",
    "this is shown in figure [ sclf ] , where the upper panel represents the corresponding @xmath235 component .",
    "the application of @xmath245 to the galaxies in the control sample produces a strong suppresion of the low - redshift contribution .",
    "this can be seen in figure [ dndz_nosc ] for the @xmath48<16.2 $ ] subsample .",
    "compared to the fiducial distribution derived in section [ ss_subsamples ] , the removal of sc sources eliminates almost completely the bump at @xmath246 .",
    "the comoving number density at @xmath9 ( equation [ ng_obs ] ) increases only @xmath247 .",
    "the hod fit suffers a decrease in @xmath248 of @xmath249 dex and an increase in @xmath250 of @xmath251 dex . for subsamples with thresholds fainter than @xmath48=16.2 $ ] ,",
    "these variations become even smaller .",
    "overall , the impact of removing sc data on the results presented in this paper is negligible .",
    "this provides solid support to the modeling of the low - redshift galaxy clustering described in sections 3 - 5 .",
    "+ we have not used the analysis from this section to derive the main results of the paper because there are potential systematic effects in the sc catalog that we have not thoroughly inspected .",
    "for instance , the sc photometry suffers from differential coverage depth across the field , which could cause an artificial contribution to the clustering .",
    "in addition , we do not have a complete statistical description of the large photometric @xmath228-band errors present in sc .",
    "an improved treatment in this analysis would entail the use of such errors to deconvolve the sc distribution of @xmath228 magnitudes , in order to be consistent with the high photometric quality of the control sample .",
    "distribution of @xmath228-band magnitudes from super cosmos sources in the ssdf region ( points ) .",
    "we fit the data with a function consisting of a power law times an error function ( dashed line ) .",
    "the best - fit error function is displayed in the top panel and represents the @xmath228-band photometric completeness of the super cosmos sample . ]",
    "redshift distribution of our brightest galaxy sample obtained from the cosmos - based control sample .",
    "the solid line represents the fiducial distribution as derived in section [ s_ctrlsamples ] , which includes sources selected only with irac data .",
    "the dashed line shows the simulated effect of removing all sources with @xmath228-band detections in super cosmos .",
    "this optical selection is very effective at suppressing the low - redshift bump . ]",
    "in the fitting procedure we have fixed all basic hod parameters except @xmath252 , and used galaxy number densities obtained through a combination of the ssdf observed number counts and the control sample . here , we check what happens if we leave all those parameters to vary freely and discard any prior information on the number density . thus , @xmath222 becomes a derived quantity trough equation [ ng ] . we still need to use the normalized redshift distributions from the control sample , however . for the sake of clarity in this section",
    ", we will call the fiducial fit of this paper _ model a _ ( 1-parameter fit , @xmath222 fixed ) , and the unconstrained one _ model b _",
    "( 5-parameter fit , @xmath222 as derived quantity ) .",
    "+ the goodness of fit , @xmath253 , remains on average the same between models _ a _ and _ b _ , which points to the latter not really being statistically favored .",
    "the @xmath13 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 relations also do not change appreciably , as shown in figure [ 1vs5param ] .",
    "this implies that : ( 1 ) the observed clustering is able to correctly reproduce the measured galaxy number density , which is a free parameter in _",
    "b _ , and ( 2 ) the values of the fixed parameters in _ a _ are reasonable choices . on average , the changes in the derived parameters and @xmath222 are @xmath254% , which supports the validity of the halo occupation model .",
    "we choose _ a _ as the fiducial model because the relation between the derived parameters and sample luminosity is more monotonic than in _ b_. the latter shows roughly the same average trends but with a stronger level of stochasticity .",
    "in essence , there would be no substantial information gain by adopting _",
    "b _ instead of _ a_. in addition ,",
    "_ a _ includes the observed number density , which places an important constraint on the hod model .",
    "the inferred densities from equation [ ng_obs ] do contain some uncertainty since they are partially derived from the control sample , but we believe that using them produces a more physically consistent hod model .",
    "+ when performing a fit of the shmr with results from _ b _ , the errors become large enough to be consistent at about 1-@xmath44 level with _",
    "a_. for example , in the m13 parametrization , for _ a _ we obtained @xmath156 , @xmath255 and @xmath256 , while for _ b _ these become @xmath257 , @xmath258 and @xmath259 .",
    "we obtain similar values when using egs as the reference catalog ( see appendix [ a_evsc ] ) .",
    "results from the hod fits to the ssdf data using the cosmos reference catalog .",
    "models a and b refer to fits using 1 and 5 free parameters , respectively ( see text ) . the galaxy number density is fixed in a to the observed number counts , but it is left as a free parameter in b. both models are fully consistent , which implies that the observed clustering can reproduce the correct number density and that the values for the fixed parameters in a are reasonable . we choose a as our fiducial model since it yields a more monotonic behavior between the derived parameters and the sample luminosity , as expected . ]                                                bleem , l.  e. , van engelen , a. , holder , g.  p. , et al .",
