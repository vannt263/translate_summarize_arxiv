    "if we assume that the deep , variable radio eclipses imply a near roche lobe filling companion , and consider a typical inclination angle @xmath72 , an unheated ( backside ) companion temperature of 2500k and @xmath73 , we can use the binary light - curve synthesis program ` icarus ' @xcite to predict magnitudes at phase @xmath74 of @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( magnitudes at maximum are 23.0 , 21.9 and 21.5 , respectively ) . thus the observed sdss limits are not constraining .",

    "[ fig : pulsars_all_group ] presents the timing residuals ( and electron column densities ) around the eclipse phase at 322 and 607 mhz , with 90s time resolution .",
    "the effect of the eclipses is generally seen from 0.18 to 0.31 orbital phase ( eclipse - zone hereafter ) at 322 mhz .",
    "the eclipses are centered at binary phase 0.24 with a duration of around 22 minutes .",
    "we estimate the radius of the companion s roche lobe , r@xmath85 @xcite , + @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the mass ratio of the companion and the pulsar , and @xmath88 is the separation of the companion from the pulsar ( @xmath89 for j1544@xmath54937 , indicating an extremely compact binary ) .",
    "the opaque portion of the companion s orbit is 0.98 r@xmath18 , much larger than r@xmath85 of 0.13  r@xmath18 , so the volume occupied by the eclipsing material is well outside the companion s roche lobe , and thus is not gravitationally bound to the companion .",
    "this confirms that this binary is a bw , where the pulsar is ablating its companion , creating a significant amount of intrabinary material that obscures the pulsar s emission .",
    "our sample consisted of six eclipses at 322 mhz where the pulsar emission was fully obscured by companion and its wind and two 607 mhz observing sessions covering the full orbit ( fig .  [ fig : pulsars_all_group ] ) . at 607 mhz",
    "we detect the msp throughout the 322 mhz eclipse - zone .",
    "however , we observe a flux fading at 607 mhz near the superior conjunction ( orbital phase 0.24 ) .",
    "significant delays in pulse arrival times are observed at 607 mhz during the eclipse - zone at 322 mhz",
    ". maximum delay in pulse arrival time at 607 mhz near the eclipse superior conjunction is around 300 @xmath10s , which corresponds to an increase in dm of 0.027 pc @xmath12 and an added electron density , n@xmath90 of 8@xmath910@xmath44 cm@xmath17 .",
    "@xcite ( t94 hereafter ) elucidate a collection of eclipse mechanisms . according to them , eclipsing due to refraction of the radio beam",
    "demands an order of magnitude higher group delay ( @xmath2 few tens of milliseconds ) than we observe for j1544@xmath54937 ( 250 @xmath10s at 322 mhz egress ) . using n@xmath918@xmath910@xmath44 cm@xmath17 observed during superior conjunction at 607 mhz and absorption length about twice the size of the eclipse - zone , according to equation 11 of t94",
    "we find that free - free absorption is possible ( absorption optical depth @xmath92 ) if the plasma temperature t@xmath93 k , where @xmath94 is the clumping factor .",
    "this demands either a very low temperature or a very high value of the clumping factor , both of which are not physically achievable .",
    "eclipsing by pulse smearing ( due to the increase of n@xmath90 along the line - of - sight ) can be ruled out , as the excess electron column density inferred from 607 mhz predicts 373 @xmath10s smearing of pulses at 322 mhz near superior conjunction ( considering incoherent dedispersion ) , which is less than one fifth of pulse period . since j1544@xmath54937 has a narrow main - pulse , and no significant profile evolution is apparent at the eclipse boundary , pulse broadening due to scattering can reduce the detectability but can not explain the eclipse .",
    "in addition , since j1544@xmath54937 is relatively weak , nearby and has a shallower spectrum than b1957@xmath520 , the expected induced compton scattering optical depth is much less than one ( equation 26 of t94 ) .",
    "another eclipse mechanism considered by t94 is cyclotron - synchrotron absorption of the radio waves by non - relativistic / relativistic electrons , which requires a magnetic field in the vicinity of the companion .",
    "we calculate a magnetic field b @xmath2 11 g and corresponding cyclotron absorption frequency @xmath2 31 mhz ( equations 35 , 37 of t94 , assuming a moment - of - inertia of 10@xmath95 g @xmath96 ) .",
    "thus 322 and 607 mhz will correspond to 10th and 20th harmonics of the cyclotron resonance . for a fixed temperature , the optical depth for cyclotron absorption drops with harmonics , which may explain the lack of absorption seen at 607 mhz .",
    "a modified model is proposed by @xcite based on kinematic treatment of cyclotron damping , assuming white - dwarf companions with reasonably strong surface magnetic fields .",
    "further observations over a wider radio spectrum may help to investigate the frequency - dependent degree of damping predicted by this model .",
    "we observe a temporal variation of the ingress phase at 322 mhz . for two",
    "eclipses , the ingress phase is shifted to 0.16 ( from 0.18 for the other four eclipses ) , whereas there are no apparent shifts in the egress phase .",
    "this corresponds to an increase of the opaque portion by 0.15 r@xmath18 and n@xmath971.2@xmath910@xmath44 cm@xmath17 at the ingress boundary .",
    "such asymmetric increase of eclipse duration may indicate that our line - of - sight is probing a wind zone where there is systematic outflow of eclipse material .",
    "we also observe strong phase modulations and additional short - duration absorptions at ingress and egress , in time - series data at higher resolution .",
    "the durations of these features are in general around 1020 s , and hence they are not seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : pulsars_all_group ] .",
    "however , in one of the observing epochs these modulations lasted longer @xmath4 phase modulation of duration 100 s , followed by a short - duration absorption of @xmath2 180 s , then regular emission resumes for 500 s , after which the eclipse starts ( fig .",
    "[ fig : short_eclipse ] ) .",
    "fragmented blobs of plasma randomly oriented around eclipsing zone , obscuring radiation from the pulsar , can explain these short - duration absorptions .",
    "we report the gmrt discovery of an eclipsing bw pulsar , at the position of an unassociated lat source , fermi j1544.2 + 4941 .",
    "this is the first galactic field msp discovered at the gmrt .",
    "the detection of pulsed @xmath0-rays from this pulsar demonstrates it as the source powering fermi j1544.2 + 4941 . due to the limited significance of the source in @xmath0-rays",
    "additional data are needed before conclusions on peak multiplicity and system geometry can be drawn .",
    "the implied efficiency ( @xmath2 3% ) of converting spin - down energy into @xmath0-rays is typical of lat - detected msps .",
    "this is the first discovery of a radio msp in a lat source fainter than the 2fgl catalog limit @xcite .",
    "since the radio pulsar is relatively bright , this provides strong justification to continue these searches as new lat sources are revealed in analyses of longer datasets .",
    "the radio flux is uncorrelated with the @xmath0-ray flux @xcite , so even faint new lat sources can harbor bright radio msps .    eclipsing bw pulsars have the potential of providing information on the evolutionary connection between the low - mass x - ray binaries and isolated msps . with long term monitoring of this pulsar",
    "we aim to estimate @xmath98 and its higher derivatives , which can provide an estimate of the life span of the system .",
    "@xcite noted that for bw systems the measured value of @xmath99/a@xmath100 is an order of magnitude higher than for other msp binaries , indicative of greater energy flux needed to ablate the companion .",

    "dual frequency observations presented in this paper suggest that cyclotron absorption by the plasma formed via interaction of the pulsar wind with ablated material can obscure the pulsed emission .",

    "<S> using the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) we performed deep observations to search for radio pulsations in the directions of unidentified _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) @xmath0-ray sources . </S>",
    "<S> we report the discovery of an eclipsing black - widow millisecond pulsar , psr j1544 + 4937 , identified with the un - cataloged @xmath0-ray source fermi j1544.2 + 4941 . </S>",
    "<S> this 2.16 ms pulsar is in a 2.9 hours compact circular orbit with a very low - mass companion ( @xmath1 ) . at 322 mhz this pulsar </S>",
    "<S> is found to be eclipsing for 13% of its orbit , whereas at 607 mhz the pulsar is detected throughout the low - frequency eclipse phase . </S>",
    "<S> variations in the eclipse ingress phase are observed , indicating a clumpy and variable eclipsing medium . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , additional short - duration absorption events are observed around the eclipse boundaries . using the radio timing ephemeris we were able to detect @xmath0-ray pulsations from this pulsar , confirming it as the source powering the @xmath0-ray emission </S>",
