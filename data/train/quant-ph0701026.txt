    "quantum state engineering is an area of growing importance in quantum optics , its relevance lying mainly in the potential applications in other areas of physics , such as quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum computation @xcite , quantum communication @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite , quantum lithography @xcite , decoherence of states @xcite , and so on . to give a few examples of their usefulness and relevance , quantum states arise in the study of quantum decoherence effects in mesoscopic fields @xcite ; entangled states and quantum correlations @xcite ; interference in phase space @xcite ; collapses and revivals of atomic inversion @xcite ; engineering of ( quantum state ) reservoirs @xcite ; etc .",
    "also , it is worth mentioning the importance of the statistical properties of one state in determining some relevant properties of another @xcite , as well as the use of specific quantum states as input to engineer a desired state @xcite .",
    "dynamical systems theory ( dst ) , on the other hand , is a completely different area of study , whose interest lies mainly in nonlinear phenomena , the source of chaotic phenomena .",
    "dst groups several approaches to the study of chaos , involving lyapunov exponent , fractal dimension , bifurcation , and symbolic dynamics among other elements @xcite .",
    "recently , other approaches have been considered , such as information dynamics and entropic chaos degree @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold : to introduce novel states of electromagnetic fields , namely truncated states having coefficients obtained _ via _ iterative process ( tsi ) , and to study chaos phenomena using standard techniques from quantum optics , making an analogy with dst .",
    "we note that , unlike previous states studied in the literature @xcite , each coefficient of the tsi is obtained from the previous one by iteration of a function .",
    "features of this state are studied by analyzing several of its statistical properties in different regimes ( chaotic _ versus _",
    "nonchaotic ) according to dst , and , for some iterating functions , we found properties of tsi very sensitive ( resembling chaos ) to the first coefficient @xmath0 , which is used as a   seed   to obtain the remaining @xmath1 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the tsi and in section 3 we analyze the behavior of some of its properties as the hilbert space dimension is increased . in section 4",
    "we show how to engineer the tsi in the running - wave field domain , and the corresponding engineering fidelity is studied in section 5 .",
    "in section 6 we present our conclusions .",
    "we define tsi as @xmath2where @xmath1 is the normalized complex coefficient obtained as the @xmath3th iteration of a previously given generating function . for example , given @xmath4,@xmath1 can be the @xmath3th iterate of the quadratic functions : @xmath5 ; sine functions : @xmath6 ; logistic functions @xmath7 ; exponential functions : @xmath8 ; doubling function defined on the interval [ 0,1 ) : @xmath9 _ mod _ @xmath10 , and so on , @xmath11 being a parameter .",
    "it is worth recalling that all the functions in the above list are familiar to researchers in the field of dynamical systems theory ( dst ) .",
    "for example , for some values of @xmath11 , it is known that some of these functions can behave in quite a chaotic manner @xcite .",
    "also , note that by computing all the @xmath1 we are in fact determining the _ orbit _ of a given function , and because the @xmath1 and @xmath12 , the photon number distribution , are related by @xmath13 , fixed or periodic points of a function will correspond to fixed or periodic @xmath12 . rather than studying all the functions listed in this section , we will focus on the doubling function and the logistic function .",
    "these two functions have been widely used to understand chaos in nature . as we shall see in the following ,",
    "although very different from each other , these functions give rise to different tsi having similar patterns .",
    "since the expansion of tsi is known in the number state @xmath14 , we have @xmath15figs .",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath16 show the plots of the photon - number distribution @xmath12 versus @xmath3 for tsi using the doubling function .",
    "the hilbert space dimension is @xmath17 . in order to illuminate the behavior of tsi for different values of @xmath0",
    ", we take @xmath0 as @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively shown in figs . @xmath10 and @xmath16 .",
    "note the regular behavior for @xmath20 and rather an irregular , or chaotic , behavior for @xmath21 @xmath19 .",
    "figs . @xmath22 and @xmath23 show @xmath12 for the logistic function . for @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    "the logistic function behaves regularly ( fig.@xmath22 ) , showing clearly ( as in the case of the doubling - function ) four values for @xmath12 ; by contrast , for @xmath26 and @xmath24 , @xmath12 oscillates quite irregularly ( fig.@xmath23 ) .",
    "this is so because the photon number distribution is equivalent to the _ orbit _ of the tsi dynamics @xcite .",
    "thus , once a fixed - attracting or periodic - point is attained , the subsequent coefficients , and hence the subsequent @xmath12 , will behave in a regular manner .",
    "conversely , when no fixed point exists , @xmath12 will oscillate in a chaotic manner .",
    "therefore , by choosing suitable @xmath0 and/or @xmath11 , we can compare the properties of tsi when different regimes ( chaotic _ versus _",
    "nonchaotic ) in the dst sense are encountered .",
    "note the similarity between the properties of the logistic and the doubling functions when the dst regimes are the same .",
    "interestingly , these similarities are observed when other properties are analyzed , as we shall see in the following .    .",

    "the beam - splitter transmittance which optimizes this probability is around @xmath124 .",
    "until now we have assumed all detectors and beam - splitters as ideal .",
    "although very good beam - splitters are available by advanced technology , the same is not true for photo - detectors in the optical domain .",
    "thus , let us now take into account the quantum efficiency @xmath125 at the photodetectors . for this purpose , we use the langevin operator technique as introduced in norton1 to obtain the fidelity to get the tsi .",
    "output operators accounting for the detection of a given field @xmath126 reaching the detectors are given by @xcite    @xmath127    where @xmath125 stands for the efficiency of the detector and @xmath128 , acting on the environment states , is the noise or langevin operator associated with losses into the detectors placed in the path of modes @xmath129 .",
    "we assume that the detectors couple neither different modes @xmath130 nor the langevin operators @xmath131 , so the following commutation relations are readily obtained from eq.([e9 ] ) :    @xmath132 & = & 1-\\eta ,   \\label{e10a } \\\\ \\left [ \\widehat{l}_{\\alpha } , \\widehat{l}_{\\beta } ^{\\dagger } \\right ] & = & 0 . \\label{e10b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the ground - state expectation values for pairs of langevin operators are    @xmath133    which are useful relations specially for optical frequencies , when the state of the environment can be very well approximated by the vacuum state , even for room temperature .",
    "let us now apply the scheme of the ref.@xcite to the present case . for simplicity we will assume all detectors having high efficiency ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "this assumption allows us to simplify the resulting expression by neglecting terms of order higher than @xmath135 .",
    "when we do that , instead of @xmath136 , we find the ( mixed ) state @xmath137 describing the field plus environment , the latter being due to losses coming from the nonunit efficiency detectors .",
    "we have , @xmath138where , for brevity , we have omitted the kets corresponding to the environment .",
    "here @xmath139 is the reflectance of the beam splitter , @xmath140 is the identity operator and @xmath141 , @xmath142 stands for losses in the first , second @xmath143 @xmath144 detector .",
    "although the @xmath145 commute with any system operator , we have maintained the order above to keep clear the set of possibilities for photo absorption : the first term , which includes @xmath146 , indicates the probability for nonabsorption ; the second term , which include @xmath147 , indicates the probability for absorption in the first detector ; and so on .",
    "note that in case of absorption at the k-@xmath148 detector , the annihilation operator @xmath85 is replaced by the @xmath149 creation langevin operator .",
    "other possibilities such as absorption in more than one detector lead to a probability of order lesser than @xmath135 , which will be neglected .",
    "next , we have to compute the fidelity @xcite , @xmath150 , where @xmath100 is the ideal state given by eq.([experimental ] ) , here corresponding to the tsi characterized by the parameters shown in tables i - iv , and @xmath151 is the state given in the eq.([damped ] ) . assuming @xmath152 @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 and starting with @xmath20 and @xmath40 for the doubling function , we find @xmath156 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 , respectively , and for the logistic function , starting with @xmath24 , @xmath159 and @xmath45 , we find @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 , respectively .",
    "these high fidelities show that efficiencies around @xmath163 lead to states whose degradation due to losses is not so dramatic for @xmath121 .",
    "in this paper we have introduced new states of the quantized electromagnetic field , named truncated states with probability amplitudes obtained through iteration of a function ( tsi ) .",
    "although tsi can be building using various functions such as logistic , sine , exponential functions and so on , we have focused our attention on the doubling and the logistic functions , which , as is well known from dynamical systems theory , can exhibit a chaotic behavior in the interval ( 0,1 ] . to characterize the tsi for the doubling and logistic functions we have studied various of its features , including some statistical properties , as well as the behavior of these features when",
    "the dimension @xmath46 of hilbert space is increased .",
    "interesting , we found a transition from sub - poissonian statistics to super - poissonian statistics when @xmath46 is relatively small ( @xmath164 ) .",
    "besides , photon number distribution , which is analogous to concept of orbits in the study of the dynamic of maps , shows a regular or rather a chaotic  behavior depending on existing or not fixed or periodic points in the function to be iterated .",
    "interestingly enough , we have found a pattern when the properties of  tsi for logistic function are compared with that of tsi for the doubling function from the point of view of dynamical systems theory ( dst ) . for example , as @xmath12 has an analog with orbits from dst , it is straightforward to identify repetitions ( or _ periods _ ) in @xmath12 , if there are any , when the hilbert space is increased .",
    "surprisingly , although the doubling and the logistic function are different from each other , when other properties such as even and odd photon number distribution , the average number and its variance , the mandel parameter and the second order correlation function were studied , they presented the same following pattern : if , from the point of view of dst , the coefficients of tsi for the doubling and the logistic function correspond to a nonchaotic ( chaotic ) regime , all those properties increases smoothly ( irregularly ) when the hilbert space is increased .",
