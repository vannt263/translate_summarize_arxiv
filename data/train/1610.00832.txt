    "suppose that @xmath1 admits an affine structure for which the holonomy representation @xmath2 is injective , and has non - trivial translational subgroup @xmath3 .",
    "then the simplicial volume of @xmath1 vanishes .",
    "recall that , for a closed oriented manifold @xmath1 , the simplicial volume @xmath4 is a topological invariant which measures how efficiently the fundamental class of @xmath1 can be represented as a real singular chain .",
    "this non - negative real valued invariant was introduced by gromov @xcite and thurston ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 6 ) .",
    "a smooth manifold @xmath1 supports an affine structure if one can choose charts for @xmath1 so that all transition maps are affine maps .",
    "if @xmath1 has an affine structure , then there is an associated _ holonomy representation _ @xmath5 , and a @xmath6-equivariant _ developing map _ @xmath7 ( unique up to affine transformations ) .",
    "if the developing map @xmath8 is a homeomorphism , then the affine structure is called _ complete_.    if @xmath1 has a complete affine structure , then it follows that the holonomy representation is injective , and that @xmath1 is aspherical .",
    "thus from our * main theorem * we obtain ( see also the discussion in section [ complete - case ] ) :    if @xmath1 is a closed manifold with a complete affine structure , and the holonomy contains a pure translation , then @xmath9 .    on the other hand ,",
    "there exist examples of complete affine manifolds whose ( necessarily injective ) holonomy representation contains no pure translations  and hence are not covered by our * main theorem*.    we have established a special case of the following natural :    if @xmath1 is a closed manifold supporting an affine structure , then @xmath10 .",
    "in the context of closed complete affine manifolds , the auslander conjecture predicts that the fundamental group of such a manifold is virtually polycyclic . since manifolds",
    "whose fundamental group are virtually polycyclic have vanishing simplicial volume , for this class of manifolds our conjecture would follow immediately from the auslander conjecture . in particular , from the work of abels - margulis - soifer @xcite , we see that for _ complete _ affine manifolds , our conjecture holds in dimensions @xmath11 .",
    "another famous problem is the chern conjecture , which asserts that affine manifolds have zero euler characteristic . but",
    "a well - known conjecture of gromov predicts that aspherical manifolds with vanishing simplicial volume automatically have vanishing euler characteristic .",
    "so if gromov s conjecture is correct , then our conjecture would immediately imply the chern conjecture .",
    "the chern conjecture has so far only been established for particular families of affine structures or of manifolds .",
    "for example , it is known to hold for complete affine manifolds @xcite , for affine manifolds with linear holonomy in @xmath12 @xcite ( a conjecture of markus predicts this is equivalent to being complete ) , for surfaces @xcite , for higher rank irreducible locally symmetric manifolds @xcite , for manifolds which are locally a product of hyperbolic planes @xcite , and for complex hyperbolic surfaces @xcite .",

    "thus the @xmath57 entry survives to the @xmath58-page , establishing that @xmath59 .",
    "now the closed orientable aspherical manifold @xmath60 is a model for @xmath61 , so we obtain the lower bound @xmath62 . since @xmath24 is non - trivial , we have that @xmath63 , and hence that @xmath64 .",
    "this forces @xmath65 , and lemma [ lem : claim1 ] allows us to conclude @xmath20 .",
    "as was pointed out to us by c. lh , the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] still works if instead of @xmath1 aspherical , we only have @xmath66 .",
    "it is tempting to use lemma [ lem : claim1 ] to attack the general case of lck s question .",
    "notice that the induced homomorphism @xmath67 appears naturally inside the lyndon - hochschild - serre spectral sequence .",
    "indeed , @xmath68 appears as the @xmath69-term in the spectral sequence .",
    "thus , whether or not the induced homomorphism @xmath23 is zero translates to whether or not the @xmath69 survives to the @xmath58-page , i.e. whether or not @xmath70 . in the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] ,",
    "our hypotheses already forced @xmath71 .",
    "this section is devoted to the proof of the * main theorem*. so let us assume that @xmath1 is a connected closed aspherical affine manifold , @xmath16 , and the holonomy representation @xmath72 is injective with @xmath73 non - zero .",
    "since the simplicial volume is multiplicative under finite covers , it is sufficient to show that a finite cover of @xmath1 has vanishing simplicial volume .",
    "since the hypotheses in our theorem are inherited by finite covers , we will from now on assume that the manifold @xmath1 is orientable .",
    "we have the following commutative diagram relating the various groups we are interested in : @xmath74{cd4 } } \\ ] ] here @xmath24 is the purely translational part of @xmath75  and by hypothesis , @xmath24 is non - trivial , so of rank @xmath76 .",
    "this forces @xmath77 .",
    "since @xmath78 and @xmath1 is aspherical , @xmath75 and @xmath24 are torsion free .",
    "note that @xmath79 is an @xmath15-dimensional model for a @xmath45 , which immediately gives us :    * fact 1 : * @xmath47 , with @xmath80 , and hence @xmath81 .",
    "next we consider @xmath82 , where @xmath35 is the linear part of the holonomy action . a special case of the main theorem of @xcite states :    if @xmath83 is a finitely generated integral domain of characteristic zero , then @xmath84 has finite cohomological dimension @xmath85 if and only if there is an upper bound on the ranks of abelian subgroups of @xmath86 .    for a finite generating set @xmath87 , take @xmath88 to be the subring of @xmath39 generated ( over @xmath89 ) by the finite collection of matrix entries of @xmath90 .",
    "then @xmath83 is a ( finitely generated ) characteristic zero integral domain , since it is a subring of @xmath39 , and @xmath91 .",
    "we now use the embedding @xmath92 to identify @xmath35 with its isomorphic copy in @xmath93 . since @xmath35 is a finitely generated linear group ,",
    "it has a finite index torsion - free subgroup @xmath94 ; we replace @xmath95 by the finite index subgroups @xmath96 .",
    "this replaces @xmath1 by a finite cover @xmath97 , so we can now also assume that the quotient group @xmath35 is torsion - free .",
    "taking a finitely generated abelian subgroup @xmath98 ( necessarily torsion - free ) , we have a corresponding exact sequence : @xmath99{cd5 } } \\ ] ] since @xmath24 , @xmath100 are finitely generated torsion - free abelian , we see that @xmath101 is a finitely generated nilpotent group . also , @xmath102 is an @xmath15-dimensional @xmath103 .",
    "hence @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the hirsch length of @xmath106 ( see gruenberg ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 8.8 ) ) .",
    "but from the two step nilpotence sequence above , the hirsch length of @xmath106 is just @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the rank of @xmath100 .",
    "hence @xmath109 , and @xmath110 is the desired upper bound on the rank of the abelian subgroups of @xmath35 . applying alperin and shalen s result ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath35 has finite cohomological dimension @xmath111 .",
    "since any finite length free @xmath112 $ ] resolution of @xmath89 can be tensored with @xmath39 to obtain a same length free @xmath113 $ ] resolution of @xmath39 , this yields @xmath114 , which establishes    * fact 2 : * @xmath115 for some finite @xmath116 .",
    "finally , we will use the following result of feldman ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.4 )    for @xmath86 a group , and @xmath117 a normal subgroup , @xmath118 a field .",
    "if @xmath100 is of type @xmath119 ( over the field @xmath118 ) , and @xmath120 , then @xmath121    from * fact 1 * and * fact 2 * we see that the hypotheses of feldman s theorem hold for @xmath122 ( with @xmath123 ) .",
    "since @xmath124 , feldman s theorem gives us the inequality @xmath125 .",
    "applying lemma [ lem : claim1 ] concludes the proof of the * main theorem*.    as the reader can easily see , this same proof applies to the following more general setting .",
    "let @xmath1 be closed connected @xmath15-manifold , and assume that @xmath16 has @xmath126 . if @xmath127 is a normal elementary amenable subgroup of type @xmath119 , and @xmath128 is a linear group , then @xmath10 . for the portions of the proof relying on hirsch length , one can use hillman s extension of the hirsch length to elementary amenable groups , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 ) .",
    "note also that elementary amenable groups of type @xmath119 are automatically virtually solvable , see @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the case of closed _ complete _ affine manifolds provides a large class of manifolds satisfying the hypotheses of our * main theorem*. for these manifolds , it is tempting to try and give a more direct , geometrical proof that @xmath10 .",
    "indeed , one can consider the foliation of @xmath129 given by affine subspaces in the directions spanned by the ( non - trivial ) translational subgroup . since the developing map is a homeomorphism @xmath130 , the translational subgroup acts discretely ( hence cocompactly ) on the leaves of this foliation .",
    "normality of the translational subgroup implies that this foliation of @xmath131 descends to a foliation of @xmath1 by closed submanifolds , where each leaf is finitely covered by a torus .",
    "if this foliation was a fibration , then it would follow that @xmath10 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* exercise 14.15 ) .",
    "more generally , @xmath10 if @xmath1 admits a polarized @xmath132-structure ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this geometric approach then motivates the following interesting      in the non - complete case , one can still foliate the image of the development map @xmath8 by affine subspaces in the directions spanned by the translational subgroup , and then pull back this foliation via @xmath8 to a foliation on @xmath133 .",
    "the foliation on @xmath133 will still descend to a foliation on @xmath1 , but it is unclear whether the leaves of the resulting foliation on @xmath1 are even _",
    "closed_. indeed , if one takes a leaf of the foliation in @xmath129 , its pre - image in @xmath133 could consist of countably infinitely many leaves for the induced foliation of @xmath133",
