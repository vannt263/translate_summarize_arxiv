    "the theoretical understanding of the non - equilibrium transport properties of strongly interacting systems in low dimensions has become a very active field of research , mainly due to the experimental activity in the fields of nanoscale materials  @xcite and cold atomic gases,@xcite as well as due to advances in theoretical methods designed to deal with both the non - equilibrium situation _ and _ electronic correlations ( see refs .   for an overview and references therein ) .",
    "when considering non - equilibrium electronic transport , we have in mind a nanostructure that is subject to a large external voltage such that linear response theory does not apply anymore . the main theoretical question that one would like to address is the dependence of the electrical current on the applied voltage , i.e. , the current - voltage characteristics , understanding not only the steady - state current reached on large time - scales , but also the transient regime appearing on shorter time - scales .",
    "another important question is the characterization of the current - carrying state , contrasting its properties against equilibrium states in the absence of a voltage . from the experimental point of view ,",
    "knowledge of the full dependence of the electronic current on the bias voltage through an interacting nanostructure is a question of utmost importance , as this measurement is a standard technique to map out electronic energy levels and to observe many - body effects in nanostructures ( see , e.g. , ref .   for experimental work and ref .   on theoretical work ) .",
    "a paramount issue when studying transport in strongly interacting systems is the behavior of the insulating states characteristic of these systems , the most relevant of which is the mott insulator ( mi ) state .",
    "considerable theoretical efforts have so far been devoted to the study of non - equilibrium transport in nanostructures such as quantum dots ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) . using state - of - the - art - numerical approaches ,",
    "substantial progress has been made in calculating the current - voltage characteristics and non - equilibrium properties of some basic models , such as the interacting resonant level model  @xcite or the single - impurity anderson model@xcite as well as in understanding their transient behavior.@xcite whereas quantum dots with an odd number of electrons exhibit perfect conductance in the low bias regime due to the kondo effect,@xcite an extended region with repulsive interactions , an even number of electrons , and at half filling is an insulator . the crossover from single quantum dots to this mott insulating state has been studied in refs .   on the level of linear response theory , showing that the ground state alternates between a conducting state for an odd number of sites and an insulating state for an even number of sites .",
    "of course , in the limit of large systems , the difference between @xmath0 and @xmath1 electrons becomes irrelevant and the perfect conductance in a system with an odd number of electrons can only be observed at , with respect to experiments , unrealistically low energy scales .    in this paper , we shall thus turn our attention to non - equilibrium electronic transport through an extended interacting region , described by the one - dimensional hubbard model with repulsive onsite interactions .",
    "specifically we consider a one - dimensional ( 1d ) system consisting of an interacting region of length @xmath2 connected to two non - interacting leads ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : model ] ) .",
    "the interacting region is initially in the mi state and we focus on the strongly interacting regime with interaction strength on the order or larger than the bandwidth .",
    "the sudden application of a large external voltage drives the system out of equilibrium and causes a time - dependent electrical current to flow through the interacting region , destroying the mi state .",
    "our goals are first , to calculate the nonlinear current - voltage ( i - v ) characteristics ; second , to contribute to the characterization of the current - carrying state ; and third , to study the time - dependence of the entanglement entropy in this set - up .",
    "we employ the adaptive time - dependent density - matrix renormalization group ( tdmrg ) method,@xcite which has been successfully used to compute the non - equilibrium dynamics of single quantum dots.@xcite    the problem of destroying a mi by subjecting it to a voltage or an electric field is currently attracting significant attention , both for the 1d @xcite and the 3d cases,@xcite as well as in heterostructures.@xcite in the case of an extended interacting region , the voltage can be applied with different spatial profiles in theoretical simulations , giving rise to different physical mechanisms for destroying the mi state . in the set - up sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] , we linearly interpolate between the voltages set in the leads across the interacting region .",
    "as we shall argue , this gives rise to a many - body landau - zener mechanism through which the mi breaks down .",
    "this picture has been advocated for in a series of studies by oka and collaborators,@xcite who considered both a ring geometry pierced by a time - dependent flux@xcite and a mi subject to a linear potential without including a coupling to leads.@xcite both approaches model the application of an electric field .",
    "one of their main results is that the breakdown of a mi is governed by the same physical laws as the one of a band insulator , with the difference that the band gap needs to be replaced by the charge gap of the strongly - interacting mi.@xcite    our setup is chosen to closely catch features of an actual transport experiment by including the leads .",
    "we shall provide a qualitative comparison of our results with other cases recently addressed in the literature.@xcite transport through extended interacting regions that are not necessarily in a mi state has been studied as well in refs .  , emphasizing as recurring themes the appearance of nonlinear current - voltage characteristics and negative differential conductances .    our main result is the accurate numerical calculation of steady - state currents for the geometry of fig .  [",
    "fig : model ] .",
    "we find that the current - voltage characteristics can be described by an expression of the form @xmath3 in agreement with refs .  , implying that at sufficiently large voltages , the system is driven to a conducting state with @xmath4 .",
    "we show that @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the mott gap .",
    "in addition , we analyze several quantities in the current - carrying state , with a particular focus on the double occupancy and spin correlations .",
    "while the current - carrying state still has a tendency towards antiferromagnetic correlations , this instability is strongly suppressed compared to the mi state . however ,",
    "neither the spin - structure factor nor the double occupancy , which is a measure of the interaction energy stored in the interacting region , saturate in the time window that we can access numerically .",
    "this suggests that the interacting region still undergoes a reorganization of internal energy while the particle flow in and out of the interacting region is already constant .",
    "the crossover from the insulating regime to the conducting regime is also reflected in the time - dependence of the entanglement entropy .",
    "we further show that this quantity behaves similarly to the case of global quenches : in our set - up , which is relevant for transport , the entanglement entropy increases linearly in time in the conducting regime . here , the increase of entanglement is due to real particles moving around , different from the situation encountered in quantum quenches with homogeneous particle densities , in which propagating collective excitations induce entanglement.@xcite    one - dimensional mott insulators can be realized experimentally in several classes of materials . a promising class of materials that have been suggested to realize 1d mi are carbon nanotubes.@xcite a recent experiment on carbon - nanotube field - effect devices made from small - band - gap and nominally metallic carbon nanotubes has shown evidence for the realization of such a mi state.@xcite theoretical work  @xcite indicates that carbon nanotubes can be modeled by the hubbard model on a two - leg ladder geometry . since in this effort",
    "we are interested in the generic behavior of a mi in the non - equilibrium regime , and since we also need to keep the numerical effort at a manageable level , we will consider only 1d chains , as opposed to ladders .",
    "nevertheless our results may set the grounds for future studies on the appealing two - leg ladder geometry .",
    "besides realizations in nanostructures , the electronic properties of some quasi - one dimensional transition metal oxides are known to be well described by the one - dimensional hubbard model .",
    "most notably , mott insulator physics was found to be realized in srcuo@xmath7 and sr@xmath7cuo@xmath8 and the specific question of the dielectric breakdown of the mi state was experimentally addressed by taguchi _",
    "et al . _  in ref .  .",
    "the actual physics of this experiment , however , may go beyond a simple hubbard model description , as has been emphasized by eckstein , oka , and werner .",
    "@xcite    an additional and related line of experimental research uses time - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy to drive systems with a gap into gapless phases ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "this method allows one to discriminate mott insulators from other insulating states .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following . in section  [ modelandmethods ]",
    "we present the model and briefly describe our numerical approach . in section  [ results ]",
    "we present our results for real - time currents , spin correlations , the double occupancy , and the entanglement entropy .",
    "section  [ discussion ] contains a summary and we discuss our results , contrasting them against the recent literature .",
    "to study the non - equilibrium transport in a mott insulator we consider a one - dimensional chain with @xmath9 electronic sites .",
    "the chain is divided into three different regions : a non - interacting region at the left , representing a lead ; an interacting region in the center , where the mott insulator state is located ; and another non - interacting region at the right , representing another lead ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) .",
    "this setup allows us to include the effects of the leads , complementary to the approach taken in ref .  .",
    "the number of sites of the left ( right ) lead is @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , and in the interacting region is @xmath2 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the whole system can be written as    @xmath12    where    @xmath13    is the hamiltonian of a hubbard chain with onsite coulomb repulsion @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 is the hopping matrix element between the sites in the interacting region , and @xmath16 is the chemical potential in the interacting region .",
    "the second term in the hamiltonian is    @xmath17    connecting the hubbard chain to the leads with a hopping @xmath18 , resulting in a tunneling rate @xmath19 .",
    "the third term in the hamiltonian is    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the hopping matrix element in the leads . in most simulations , we set @xmath22 and we use @xmath23 as the unit of energy unless stated otherwise . in all the equations above @xmath24 represents the creation operator for an electron at site @xmath25 and spin projection @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "we are interested in the time evolution of the mi state in the interacting portion of the chain when it is driven out of equilibrium by a strong voltage bias applied between the leads .",
    "therefore , we first need to find the ground state of the system when the interacting portion of the chain is at half - filling ( @xmath29 ) and then solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation for the perturbed system with this state as an initial condition . the former is accomplished by performing a ground - state dmrg@xcite calculation with @xmath30 particles . to perturb the system and to drive the chain out of equilibrium we add an extra term to the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) , which has the effect of adding an electric potential at time @xmath31 : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the heaviside step function and    @xmath34    where @xmath35 .",
    "this mimics the effect of an electric field @xmath36 acting in the interacting part of the chain , @xmath37 being the bias voltage induced between the leads ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : model ] ) .    to solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation we use the adaptive time - dependent dmrg technique  @xcite with the methods introduced in refs .   to simulate non - equilibrium transport . in some cases",
    ", we use systems with @xmath38 odd and @xmath39 even since we find that the finite - size effects in the currents are less severe for this configuration ( compare with refs .   for the case of few quantum dots ) .",
    "the tdmrg simulations are carried out using a third order trotter - suzuki breakup with a time - step of @xmath40 and under the constraint of a fixed , maximum discarded weight of @xmath41 . in practice , this implies that one starts the time - evolution with a relatively small number of states ( @xmath42 ) which then grows fast .",
    "the maximum number of states during the time - evolution is @xmath43 states .",
    "since the accuracy of the numerical results solely depends on these control parameters , i.e. , the discarded weight and the time step , tdmrg can be considered a quasi - exact method , as the numerical error can be estimated by varying @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    in non - equilibrium ,",
    "the entanglement encoded in the time - dependent wave function is not bounded by any area law as is the ground - state entanglement  @xcite and may indeed increase extensively as a function of time .",
    "typically , in so - called global quenches ( i.e. , the instantaneous and homogeneous change of one parameter on all sites ) one finds a linear increase of the entanglement entropy ( the von - neumann entropy ) @xmath46 with time ( see , e.g. , ref .   for the case of conformally invariant systems ) .",
    "since the number of states @xmath47 used in a dmrg calculation scales as@xcite    @xmath48    reaching long time scales is an exponentially expensive computational task whenever @xmath46 . understanding the time - dependence of @xmath49 itself in generic set - ups is thus an important objective to judge limitations and capabilities of tdmrg , besides the general and timely interest in its time - dependence in various kinds of quenches.@xcite    the fact that the number of states increases monotonically with time defines a maximum time for each simulation as the time at which the number of states needed to keep the discarded weight under a fixed value @xmath50 exceeds the maximum of @xmath43 .",
    "then , for representative parameters , we perform several runs with different @xmath50 to assess and assure the numerical quality of the data , which ultimately determines the maximum time @xmath51 at which the data for a given observable are still sufficiently reliable .",
    "we define the symmetrized tunnel current as the average of the two local currents connecting the interacting region to the left and right leads :    @xmath52    we will denote the time - dependent expectation value of the symmetrized current by @xmath53 whereas the time - averaged current will simply be denoted as @xmath54 .",
    "the currents are measured in units such that @xmath55 corresponds to perfect conductance , i.e. , @xmath56 ( @xmath57 in our work ) .",
    "local currents @xmath58 on other bonds are defined accordingly .",
    "the structure of this section is the following .",
    "first , we present the real - time data for the electric current and discuss the properties of the steady - state currents established after the dielectric breakdown of the mott insulator takes place .",
    "second , we analyze the current - voltage characteristics . as the main result of the paper we find a simple function to describe the current as a function of the bias voltage and the value of the lieb - wu gap associated to the initial mott insulating state , similar to the results reported by oka et al.@xcite third , we characterize the current - carrying state in the interacting region by studying the time evolution of the charge and the current profiles , the double occupancy , and the spin - spin correlations .",
    "finally , we discuss the time - dependence of the entanglement entropy .",
    "figure  [ fig : real - time - current ] shows some examples of the real - time data for the symmetrized tunnel current obtained from our simulations for @xmath59 and two values of @xmath60 . the transient behavior , in general , can be expected to depend on both the tunneling rate , set by @xmath61 , and the voltage . for a small interacting region coupled to non - interacting leads , the transient regime has been studied in refs .  .",
    "in our results , for all voltages , the generic behavior is that the current first goes through a transient regime , with a maximum reached in the time window @xmath62 .",
    "the figure shows that the time - scale for reaching the first maximum is independent of the bias , while it clearly depends on @xmath60 ( this is obvious if one plots the results versus time in units of @xmath63 )",
    ". then , accompanied with oscillations whose period decreases with increasing voltage @xmath37 , we reach a quasi - steady state regime ( typically at times @xmath64 ) where the current is constant , apart from oscillations .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillations decays as the steady - state is approached , yet from our data we can not determine whether this decay is an exponential one or not .",
    "the period @xmath65 of the oscillations is a monotonically decreasing function , similar to the case of single quantum dots in which @xmath66.@xcite    = 0.49    = 0.49    the time window over which the steady - state current can be sustained on a finite system can in principle depend on both @xmath9 and @xmath67 .",
    "@xmath9 trivially limits the accessible time - scales to @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the fermi velocity in the leads,@xcite since by that time , the perturbations induced in the leads by the application of the bias have traveled from the interacting region to the boundary and back , then perturbing the quasi - steady - state currents .",
    "@xmath67 does not pose any limit on the stability of the steady - state regime for the setup considered here , because the bias voltage is introduced _ locally _ as a homogeneous electric field .",
    "therefore we choose the values of @xmath9 and @xmath67 to give a value of @xmath70 similar to the @xmath51 discussed in the previous section , @xmath71 .      in this section",
    "we focus on the steady - state current and its dependence on the various parameters of the model , presenting results obtained from extensive numerical calculations . in practice , we compute the steady - state current by averaging over one or two periods of the oscillations at the longest times reached in the simulations ( but @xmath72 ) to reduce the effect of the oscillations .",
    "an example is shown with arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : real - time - current](a ) for @xmath73 . we shall find that the current is a simple function of the bias voltage with all the microscopic details of the model encoded in the two coefficients @xmath74 and @xmath75 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : iv ] ) .",
    "i - v curves were previously presented for the ring geometry for very short chains and in that case , the currents were extracted from the short - time dynamics.@xcite    = 0.49    figure  [ fig : iv ] shows the steady - state current @xmath54 as a function of the bias voltage @xmath37 for @xmath76 and @xmath59 with @xmath77 . the data from our numerical simulations for @xmath54 as a function of the bias voltage fit to eq .",
    "( [ eq : iv ] ) with an excellent agreement , @xmath74 and @xmath75 being the fitting parameters . therefore , for values of @xmath78 below the threshold @xmath75 , @xmath54 is exponentially suppressed whereas for values of @xmath79 above the threshold , @xmath54 increases linearly .",
    "the exponential term is dominant at low bias and causes the suppression of the current and represents the landau - zener tunneling rate  @xcite across the mott gap .",
    "the linear term is dominant at large bias and represents the motion of current - carrying excitations across the chain in the conducting regime .",
    "figure  [ fig : iv3 ] contains the i - v curves for several different @xmath80 , keeping @xmath18 and @xmath15 fixed .",
    "motivated by fig .  2 from ref .",
    ", we have plotted the steady - state current as a function of @xmath81 , where @xmath6 is the charge gap .",
    "we have calculated the charge gap for finite systems with @xmath82 sites , not connected to any leads , using @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the ground state energy in subspaces with @xmath0 fermions and a total spin projection @xmath85 . using this , and by also plotting the current in units of @xmath86 , all curves collapse on a single one , which , in particular , suggests @xmath87 , as expected for a landau - zener type of breakdown of the mi state.@xcite as we show here , this important fingerprint of landau - zener physics also survives upon coupling the interacting region to leads .",
    "we here therefore find essentially the same dependence of @xmath75 on @xmath88 as oka et al.,@xcite namely @xmath5 , but with incorporating the leads into the model .",
    "there are some differences , though .",
    "first , it should be noted that our time - averaged current is extracted from simulations that reach much longer times than ref .   where only the short - time dynamics was available to estimate the steady - state currents .",
    "second , we do not find an abrupt increase of the current at the threshold voltage , in contrast to ref .  .",
    "therefore , our data are in a better agreement with the result of mapping the problem to a quantum walk ( see fig .  3 in ref .  ) .",
    "we attribute the quantitative differences between fig .  5 in ref .   and our fig .  [",
    "fig : iv ] to the difference in the calculation of @xmath54 , the fact that our systems are larger , and the inclusion of the leads .",
    "= 0.49    to further explore the effect of the leads on @xmath75 we have computed i - v curves for a fixed value of @xmath59 and several @xmath18 , as shown in fig .  [ fig : iv2 ] .",
    "qualitatively , a larger @xmath18 leads to an overall increase of the current as reflected in the @xmath18-dependence of @xmath74 to be discussed later on .",
    "the threshold exhibits a weak dependence on @xmath18 as well , as we demonstrate in fig .",
    "[ fig : factors](a ) .",
    "our observation is that @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the latter behavior can be explained by the observation that close to the interface , the local charge gap depends on @xmath18 : @xmath91 leads to a slightly enhanced gap compared to the bulk gap and vice versa . as a consequence ,",
    "the double occupancy @xmath92 ( discussed in detail below ) in the interacting region is enhanced close to the interface compared to the bulk value for @xmath93 , while it is suppressed for @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath91 the contacts suppress the current , giving rise to an increase of @xmath75 . in the case of @xmath93 ,",
    "the largest local gap is in the bulk of the mi and decreases towards the boundary .",
    "the decrease of @xmath75 as @xmath94 can be understood as a consequence of a smaller mismatch between @xmath95 and @xmath96 in that limit , which should give rise to a increase in the transmission of electrons across the interface region .",
    "note that we observe that boundary effects in the initial state typically decay to the bulk values over a distance of about 5 sites , suggesting that @xmath82 is a reasonable choice to probe both the bulk and contact properties .",
    "= 0.49    next , we address the dependence of the prefactor @xmath74 on @xmath18 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath74 sets the value of the differential conductance in the conducting regime .",
    "we present our results for @xmath74 and various combinations of @xmath18 in fig .",
    "[ fig : factors](b ) , in units of @xmath56 .",
    "interestingly , in all cases studied , @xmath97 .",

    "@xmath74 depends on both @xmath18 and @xmath88 and , phenomenologically , we find that @xmath99 results in a convincing collapse of the i - v curves for @xmath100 ( compare fig .  [ fig : iv3 ] ) .",

    "for instance , in the simplest case in which @xmath109 in the interacting region and @xmath110 in the left(right ) lead , the physics underlying the breakdown is quite different as we have verified in additional simulations ( results not shown here ) . in this case , the redistribution of the charge inside the interacting region can be described as an effective doping of the mi region from the two interfaces .",
    "this implies that the bulk of the interacting region will experience the effects caused by turning on bias with a delay , set by the length of the interacting region .    turning back to fig .",

    "depending on the bias voltage two different behaviors can be observed . for bias voltages below the threshold @xmath118 , i.e. , in the regime of exponentially suppressed currents",
    ", @xmath119 is essentially constant , apart from the oscillations . for bias voltages above the threshold @xmath79 , @xmath119 increases according to @xmath120 i.e. , linearly in time after averaging over the period @xmath121 .",
    "the slope @xmath122 can be interpreted as the rate of the production of pairs of doublons and vacancies induced by the effective electric field.@xcite quite notably , the double occupancy never saturates over the time window simulated , i.e. , a steady - state regime for this quantity is not reached in our simulations , even if the system is in the steady - state regime for the tunneling current .",
    "a similar observation has been made in the dmft study by eckstein _",
    "et al._,@xcite who also report a monotonically increasing double occupancy @xmath119 in the steady - current regime .",
    "they ascribe this to the fact that the work done by the field is proportional to @xmath123 , which in a regime of constant currents is a constant .",
    "hence this increase in energy has to go into the internal energy of the mi , in the absence of any dissipation or leads .",
    "we shall here elaborate in more detail on this reasoning , adopting it to our set - up that includes the leads . to explain the time - dependence of @xmath124 of eq .",

    "one can move the contribution from @xmath133 to the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq : double_occups_motion ] ) and conclude that the time derivative of the average double occupancy is @xmath134 where all operators have been substituted by their quantum mechanical averages , and we have changed the equality in eq .",
    "( [ eq : double_occups_motion_rev ] ) to a proportionality to accommodate the term stemming from the kinetic energy of the doublons .",
    "the first term in the rhs is the energy flowing out of the interacting region carried away by the particles transfered to the leads . if the interacting part is an isolated system as in ref .",
    ", this term is absent .",
    "the interpretation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : double_occups_motion_rev ] ) is that although the establishment of the steady - current regime implies a linear increase of the double occupancy and therefore of the interaction energy , part of this energy is transfered to the leads when accelerated particles leave the interacting region .",
    "this reduces the rate at which the double occupancy increases , allowing the system to stay in the steady - current regime for a longer time .",

    "our work further elucidates the influence of contacts to the leads on the i - v curve : the overall current is a monotonically increasing function in the inverse tunneling rate @xmath162 and the threshold , on finite systems , also exhibits a weak dependence on the contacts .",

    ", no leads are included , and the bias is applied as a step - function function to a homogeneous mi , measuring the local current on the central link . while the i - v curve also shows an activated behavior , it is not clear whether the mi is also destroyed through a landau - zener mechanism in the set - up of kirino and ueda . in particular , they report @xmath163 , in contrast to the results by oka et al .  and ours ( compare fig .  [",
    "fig : iv3 ] ) .",
    "this illustrates the rich and various physical scenarios that can underlie the breakdown of an insulating state , depending on the way the bias is applied .",
    "we have also studied the conducting state that is reached after the breakdown .",
    "the spin - spin correlations remain antiferromagnetic in the steady state . a decrease in the amplitude of the correlations",

    "the conducting state can also be distinguished from the initial insulator by an increase in the double occupation .",
    "in other words , the electric field creates excitations as pairs of doublons and holons that can carry the current.@xcite the production rate of these excitations should be reflected in the production rate of doubly occupied sites .",
    "quite notably , the time - dependence of both the double occupancy and the spin - spin correlations implies that the interacting region is not in a true steady state yet , in which these quantities would become stationary as well .",
    "finally , we have also computed the time - dependence of the entanglement entropy .",
    "this quantity increases linearly with time in the conducting regime , implying that tdmrg simulations become exponentially expensive at long times . on the positive side ,",
    "studying transport through single quantum dots or extended structures has qualitatively the same computational complexity , since in both cases , @xmath147 ( unpublished results for one quantum dot , see ref .  ) .",
    "therefore , going from single to many quantum dots is equally feasible with this method , in contrast to other state - of - the - art techniques such as time - dependent nrg @xcite or real - time qmc.@xcite in the former , the complexity scales with the dimension of the interacting region and in the latter approach , the dynamical sign - problem is expected to become more severe for structures more complex than a single quantum dot .",
    "we have here demonstrated that tdmrg can successfully be applied to compute i - v curves of extended systems , complementing our earlier work on non - equilibrium transport in the single - impurity problem.@xcite    while our numerical analysis of several properties of the current - carrying state should be helpful in better understanding its properties , we acknowledge that a more intuitive picture of the non - equilibrium steady - state is still desirable .",
    "for instance , one would like to contrast the current - carrying steady - state against effective ground - state reference systems , an approach which in certain non - equilibrium cases works quite well.@xcite moreover , the interesting concept of an effective temperature , often used in studies of quantum quenches with a relaxation into a thermalized state ( see ref .   and references therein ) , should be further explored for current - carrying states .    in conclusion , we have shown that the dielectric breakdown of the mott insulator can be understood in terms of the landau - zener mechanism using a realistic setup that matches the experiment since we include the leads .",
