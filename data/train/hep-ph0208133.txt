    "the origin of fermion masses and mixings is one of most important issues in particle physics . in the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "the higgs field alone is responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking and mass generation .",
    "the sm , however , is incomplete and a thorough study of the coupling of the remnant higgs boson ( or in fact the lightest ( pseudo)scalar boson ) to fermions can provide hints on the actual mechanism of mass generation .    in a recent paper , we have investigated the possibility of detecting deviations from the sm in the higgs couplings to @xmath10-leptons @xcite at future @xmath11 colliders . in this letter , we expand our analysis to the case of the higgs couplings to @xmath2-quarks , which has a better potential in principle due to the larger yukawa coupling .    for definiteness",
    ", we concentrate on the determination of the ( pseudo)scalar-@xmath2-@xmath12 coupling at a linear collider with a center - of - mass energy of @xmath13 gev and accumulated luminosity of 1 ab@xmath14 , based on the tesla design @xcite",
    ". we will assume that this particle has already been discovered at the large hadron collider but a detailed study of its couplings is missing .",
    "we take into account all relevant contributions to the process @xmath0 , where @xmath1 can be an electron , muon or tau neutrino . in particular , weak gauge boson fusion is the dominant contribution to the subset of diagrams containing the higgs boson for @xmath15 gev at @xmath16 gev .    in extensions of the sm with extra scalars and pseudoscalars , the lightest spin-0 particle can be an admixture of states without a definite parity . hence , we parametrize the general @xmath3 coupling as : @xmath17 where @xmath18 gev , @xmath19 is the @xmath20quark mass and @xmath21 , @xmath22 in the sm .",
    "= 1.3    -8 cm    we will present results considering @xmath8 and @xmath2 as independent parameters and also for the cases of fixed @xmath23 , free @xmath2 and fixed @xmath24 , free @xmath8 .",
    "we will see that there is a region of insensivity around circles in the @xmath25 plane since we ca nt at this level of analysis disentangle the effects of @xmath8 and @xmath2 .",
    "the cross section for the process @xmath0 is sensitive to terms proportional to @xmath8 , which comes from the interference with non - higgs contributions , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 from pure higgs contributions .",
    "therefore , we can search for deviations from the sm prediction which could arise , for instance , in supersymmetric models .",
    "the total sm cross section for the process @xmath0 is of the order of @xmath28 fb for @xmath29 gev and at @xmath13 gev , being dominated by the @xmath30 final state , because of the many additional diagrams allowed in this case . in particular , only in this channel the weak gauge boson fusion diagram is allowed and it provides an important contribution . for comparison ,",
    "the process @xmath31 is of the order of @xmath32 fb at @xmath13 gev .    in fig .",
    "[ cross ] we show the dependence of the total cross section , summed over the three neutrino species , on the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath2 .",
    "the dependence in @xmath2 is symmetric since only terms proportional to @xmath27 contribute to the cross section . on the other hand ,",
    "the dependence on @xmath34 is asymmetric due to interference with standard model processes , which leads to the presence of linear terms in @xmath34 .",
    "we should point out that the @xmath34 dependence is more prominent in the @xmath35 case than in the previously studied @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "our goal is to see how sensitive the experiments performed at the next generation of @xmath37 colliders will be in the determination of these parameters .",
    "we performed our monte carlo simulation by generating observables represented as series in the @xmath8 and @xmath2 couplings multiplied by kinematical factors : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is any observable and the @xmath40 terms are purely kinematical structures which do not contain any @xmath8 and @xmath2 dependence and results from the amplitude squaring and phase space integration .",
    "these @xmath40 structures are the subject of the monte carlo simulation and the @xmath8 and @xmath2 couplings can be varied without the necessity to re - simulating the data for each @xmath41 point . in our particular case , @xmath42 .",
    "the event sample reproducing the expected statistics at tesla was generated using our monte carlo package while the detector response was simulated with the code simdet version 3.01@xcite .",
    "we assume an efficiency for @xmath20jet pair reconstruction of @xmath43 % , which is based on the @xmath2-tag algorithm , as assumed in ref . @xcite . in our simulations we used @xmath44 gev .    in figure [ distribution ]",
    "we show , for comparison purposes , the differential distribution in @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the scattering angle between the @xmath2-jet and initial beam directions , for the total sm contribution and for the higgs contribution only ( including interference with sm ) . to illustrate the importance of the @xmath30 final state , we plot both the contribution of only the @xmath47 final state ( which is basically the same as @xmath48 final state ) and the total contribution from the three neutrinos .",
    "we can see that in the first case the higgs contribution is small but in the total contribution it is comparable to the full sm result .",
    "= 1 -4 cm = 1    -6.5 cm    -2.5 cm    = 1 -4 cm = 1    -6 cm    in order to demonstrate the effect of different values of the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath2 , we show in figure [ ab ] the @xmath45 distribution arising from the higgs contribution for the sm ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) compared to the case with @xmath49 , with only @xmath47 neutrinos and with the three neutrinos .",
    "we see that the shapes are very similar , as expected , but the levels can be noticeable different .    as for the possible contribution from background processes , like @xmath50 ( with @xmath51-pair lost ) , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , etc . , the cross sections of these processes are either small , or they can be significantly supressed down to levels of @xmath54 fb @xcite .    another important aspect is the assumption about the detector performance and possible sources of the systematic uncertaintes .",
    "we include the anticipated systematic errors of 0.5% in the luminosity measurement , 1% in the acceptance determination , 1% in the branching ratios , and 1% in the background substraction , and assume the gaussian nature of the sytematics . to place bounds on the @xmath3 couplings , we use a standard @xmath55-criterion to analyse the events .",
    "after various kinematical distributions were examined , we found that the most strict bounds are achieved from @xmath45 distribution by dividing the distribution event samples into 10 bins .",
    "the experimental error @xmath56 for the @xmath57 bin is given by : @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the sum in quadrature of the systematic uncertainties mentioned above .    in fig .",
    "[ contour ] , we present our final results for a tesla - like environment @xcite with a center - of - mass energy of 500 gev and for @xmath61 gev .",
    "we investigated three possible scenarios for the luminosities : 100 fb@xmath14 , 1 ab@xmath14 and 10 ab@xmath14 .",
    "the allowed region for independent @xmath34 and @xmath2 parameters at 95% confidence level is the area between the circles .",
    "the horizontal bands are the allowed region for the @xmath2 parameter keeping @xmath23 .",
    "the vertical bands are the allowed region for the @xmath34 parameter keeping @xmath24 .",
    "= 1.5    -10 cm    the bounds that can be obtained at 95% confidence level are : @xmath62 for the case of @xmath24 and free @xmath34 and @xmath63 for the case of @xmath64 and free @xmath2 .",
    "these results are up to an order of magnitude better than the limits obtained in a similar manner for @xmath65leptons , mainly because of the larger yukawa coupling in case of @xmath20quarks and higher sensitivity of the process .",
    "these results can be roughly scaled for moderate variations in the higgs boson mass around @xmath66 gev by multiplying the bounds by a factor @xmath67 .",
    "we have performed a complete analysis of the sensitivity to new @xmath3 couplings from the process @xmath0 at the next generation of linear colliders .",
    "these new couplings are predicted by many extensions of the standard model .",
    "we showed that forthcoming experiments will be able to probe deviations of @xmath3 coupling .",
    "the weak gauge boson fusion process is instrumental for achieving such a precision . for a tesla - like environment , we are able to constrain the couplings at the level of a few percent for the @xmath8 parameter ( for fixed @xmath2 ) and tens of percent for the @xmath2 parameter ( for fixed @xmath8 ) .",
    "these results are comparable to the study performed in @xcite , where a global fit analysis for @xmath68 fb@xmath14 and @xmath13 gev has resulted in a relative accuracy of @xmath69% in the @xmath70 yukawa coupling .",
    "we would like to comment some aspects of the future measurements .",
    "let us assume that the higgs data anticipated from the new collider experiments will reveal a deviation from the sm predictions .",
    "in addition , suppose that one has an independent measurement of the partial width @xmath71 ( for instance , from on - mass - shell higgs production in a muonic collider ) .",
    "it easy to see that , in our parametrization , @xmath72 , while the observables we studied have the following parameter dependence @xmath73 combining our results and those from @xmath71 one can separate @xmath8 and @xmath2 contributions and obtain an explicit indication of cp violation in the higgs sector .",
