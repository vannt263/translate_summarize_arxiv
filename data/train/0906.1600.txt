    "bosonic atoms in optical lattices can display superfluid and mott insulating phases .",
    "if the system is rotated , then , in the corotating frame , this is equivalent to introducing an effective magnetic field proportional to the rotation frequency @xcite .",
    "this is not the only means to introduce a vector potential to a system of neutral atoms .",
    "this can also be achieved@xcite through the interaction of atomic electric and magnetic moments with an external electromagnetic field ( aharonov - casher and differential aharonov - bohm effects ) . for atoms trapped in an optical lattice in two distinct internal states , a scheme @xcite using two additional raman lasers combined with the lattice acceleration or inhomogeneous static electric field has also been proposed .",
    "bosonic atoms in an optical lattice can be modeled by a bose - hubbard model .",
    "a vector potential introduces an aharonov - bohm phase for the boson hopping from site to site .",
    "the wave function is `` frustrated '' if the phase twists around each plaquette add up to @xmath2 for some non - integer @xmath3 . for a bose condensate at a low effective magnetic field , this introduces vortices into the condensate .",
    "the presence of the optical lattice @xcite interferes with the formation of an abrikosov vortex lattice @xcite and quantum fluctuations may be enhanced .",
    "further , if the number of vortices becomes comparable to the number of bosons , the system may enter into a fractional quantum hall state @xcite .",
    "however , this requires a very high rotation frequency or a low atomic density which is hard to achieve experimentally .    in this work",
    ", we will focus on the experimentally accessible regime where a condensate still exists to examine whether there are any precursors to such states in a frustrated bose condensate .",
    "we study a two - dimensional ( 2d ) bose - hubbard model on a square lattice for a range of incommensurate filling . in the regime of strong on - site interaction , the model is analogous to a quantum easy - plane ferromagnet and the frustration encourages spin twists , i.e. , the formation of vortices in the ground state .",
    "we find the classical ground states using monte carlo methods and then we study the quantum fluctuations around the classical state .",
    "in other words , we work under the assumption that quantum effects do not change qualitatively the nature of the ordering obtained for the classical ground states .",
    "mathematically , this means that we will work in a large-@xmath0 generalization of the spin model and perform an expansion in @xmath1 to obtain the quantum effects .",
    "although our original model corresponds to small @xmath0 , the large-@xmath0 approach can be justified if the perturbative series in @xmath1 converges@xcite . in those cases",
    ", a spin wave calculation may give accurate results .",
    "we will study how quantum fluctuations affect the order parameter , off - diagonal long - range order ( odlro ) and the superfluid fraction for different degrees of frustration for the whole range of incommensurate filling . in the spin analog",
    ", the incommensurate filling corresponds to a range of zeeman field @xmath4 up to some frustration - dependent critical field @xmath5 .",
    "our calculations were made for @xmath6 , and 1/2 .",
    "our results show that the degree of bose condensation decreases as @xmath4 increases toward @xmath7 .",
    "however , it does not vanish at the limit of @xmath8 .",
    "this applies to several quantities that we have calculated : the reduction in the order parameter , the reduction in the largest eigenvalue of the density matrix , and the sum of the non - macroscopic eigenvalues of the density matrix .",
    "we also find similar conclusions for the superfluid fraction  frustration reduces the superfluid fraction in the comparison with the unfrustrated case but there is no vanishing of the superfluid fraction at any @xmath9 .    the paper is organized as follows .",

    "[ sec : densitymatrix ] and [ sec : superfluiddensity ] , we calculate the degree of condensation and superfluidity in the system .",
    "we make conclusions about our study in the final section .",
    "for atoms trapped in a two - dimensional optical lattice , we can focus on a single - band lattice model if the tunneling @xmath11 between wells within the lattice is weak compared to the level spacings in each well .",
    "if the tunneling is also weak compared to the repulsive energy @xmath12 for two atoms in one well , then strongly correlated ground states , such as the mott insulator , appear as well as a superfluid state .",
    "many different methods have been proposed to introduce frustration in the atomic motion .",
    "this can be done through rotating the system@xcite or through the interaction of the atoms with an external electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "if there is only one species of bosonic atoms , then the system is described by a bose - hubbard model on a square lattice with a complex hopping matrix element : @xmath13 with @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the chemical potential and @xmath16 denotes nearest - neighbor sites @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the complex tunneling couplings appear in the hubbard hamiltonian due to the presence of the effective vector potential @xmath19 .",
    "when an atom moves from a lattice site at @xmath20 to a neighboring site at @xmath21 , it will gain an aharonov - bohm phase @xmath22 for neutral atoms with electric moments @xmath23 and",
    "a magnetic moments @xmath24 in an external electromagnetic field @xmath25 , @xmath26 @xcite . for a rotating lattice , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the rotation frequency and @xmath29",
    "is the mass of the atom . in this work ,",
    "we study the case of the uniform effective magnetic field @xmath30 .",
    "results will depend on the frustration parameter @xmath3 , defined as the flux per plaquette in units of @xmath31 , @xmath32 where the integration is over the surface of a lattice plaquette and the sum is performed anticlockwise over the edges of the square plaquette .",
    "this parameter is only meaningful between 0 and 1 because a flux of @xmath31 through a plaquette has no effect on the system .",
    "frustration is maximal at @xmath33 .    in this paper",
    ", we will use a magnetic analogy as the framework to study the bose - hubbard problem .",
    "this is most easily motivated in the limit of @xmath34 , even though we will not be working directly in this limit .",
    "in such a limit , the site occupation can be restricted to zero and one boson .",
    "then , the hilbert space of possible states can be mapped onto a spin - half xy model .",
    "the two @xmath35 states of the pseudospin correspond to whether a lattice contains a boson or not .",
    "the spin raising and lowering operators correspond to the creation and annihilation of hard - core bosons , respectively .",
    "this mapping is possible because hard - core bosons have the same commutation relations as @xmath36 operators : operators on different sites commute but operators on the same site anticommute .",
    "the motion of the atoms translates to pseudospin exchange .",
    "the effective hamiltonian is @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 are the spin-@xmath40 operators , and @xmath41 represents an effective zeeman field . note that this is a ferromagnet in the absence of frustration ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "it is not simple to attack the infinite-@xmath12 limit of the problem of hard - core boson directly .",
    "instead , we will relax the hard - core condition and allow for more than one boson on each site .",
    "we will allow @xmath43 atoms on each site so that each site has @xmath44 possible states .",
    "this corresponds to a spin-@xmath0 model with the hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : easyplanemagnet ] ) . the relationship between the original bosons , @xmath45 , and this spin-@xmath0 model",
    "is established _ via _ the holstein - primakoff representation : @xmath46 where @xmath47 are operators with bosonic commutations and are essentially the original bosons @xmath48 of the bose - hubbard model .",
    "the limit of @xmath10 corresponds to the classical limit of the model .",
    "more specifically , we need @xmath10 while @xmath49 and @xmath4 remain constant so that exchange and zeeman energies remain comparable .    mathematically , the large-@xmath0 limit provides a systematic way to control the quantum fluctuations in this problem .",
    "quantum fluctuations can be introduced ( see later ) in a @xmath1 expansion under the assumption that those effects do not alter significantly the nature of the ordering obtained for the classical ground states .",
    "we will present results to leading order in @xmath1 ( i.e. , we do not set @xmath36 afterward ) .",
    "physically , the leading - order results in @xmath0 should be relevant to optical lattices with many atoms per site on average .",
    "the relaxation of the maximum site occupancy to @xmath43 from a model of hard - core bosons is not the only way to control correlations in the bose - hubbard model at weak tunneling .",
    "a similar methodology is to consider a dense but weakly interacting limit of the bose - hubbard model . with @xmath50 being the average boson density per site ,",
    "this limit is given by @xmath51 and @xmath52 while @xmath53 remains constant @xcite .",
    "then , one can develop a theory as an expansion in @xmath54 .",
    "this approach produces results very close to the @xmath1 expansion considered here .",
    "note that our hamiltonian has local gauge invariance .",
    "if we change the gauge , @xmath55 , then the hamiltonian stays unchanged if the boson and spin operators pick up a phase change .",
    "@xmath56 in the spin language , this corresponds to a rotation of @xmath57 in the @xmath58 plane in spin space .    before proceeding to discuss the properties of this system",
    ", we point that we may generalize this to an optical lattice containing two species of bosonic atoms , such as two hyperfine states .",
    "let us denote the two species by @xmath59 .",
    "this allows for more degrees of freedom in the model hamiltonian .",
    "two atomic species may , in general , see different lattice potentials so that the tunneling matrix elements and chemical potentials could be different for the two species . the hubbard model for the two species",
    "would be of the form @xmath60 with @xmath61 where the on - site interaction @xmath62 , the exchange interaction @xmath63 , the tunneling phase @xmath64 , and the chemical potential @xmath65 have all acquired a dependence on the internal states of the bosons .",
    "if we specialize to the case of one atom per site with strong on - site interactions , we can rule out zero or double occupation of each lattice site . in other words ,",
    "the system should be a mott insulator but the atom occupying each site can be of either internal state .",
    "thus , each site has a spin - half degree of freedom : @xmath66 would create a @xmath67 state and @xmath68 would create a @xmath69 state . in this phase , the relative motion of the two species of atoms is still possible : the motion of one species in one direction must be accompanied by the motion of the other species in the opposite direction .",
    "this counterflow keeps the occupation at one atom at each site . in the pseudospin language",
    ", this is simply spin exchange . therefore , in this mott phase for the overall density , we have again an easy - plane magnet . if we tune the interactions so that @xmath70 , then a perturbation theory in @xmath71 brings us to the effective pseudospin hamiltonian@xcite described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : easyplanemagnet ] ) with @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "we can translate the phases of the single - species hubbard model to this two - species system at unit filling .",
    "superfluidity in the single - species hamiltonian at an incommensurate filling corresponds to superfluidity for counterflow in the two - species problem at the commensurate filling of one atom per site but with different relative densities of the two species .",
    "the advantage of considering this two - species mott insulator is that there may be more degrees of freedom in tuning the parameters of pseudospin hamiltonian , including the explicit breaking of @xmath75 spin symmetry .",
    "to determine the ground states of the pseudospin hamiltonian ( [ eq : easyplanemagnet ] ) , we consider first the @xmath76 classical ground states for the spin system .",
    "we assume that @xmath77 without loss of generality . in the absence of the vector potential ,",

    "the ordering pattern of the classical ground state depends on the effective magnetic flux through each plaquette .",

    "we examined our results for any precursor to the non - superfluid or uncondensed states .",
    "we have found that frustration can decrease the depletion of the condensate and the superfluid fraction .",
    "however , the fractional depletion of the condensate and the superfluid fraction remain finite for all incommensurate filling [ @xmath284 . the behavior of the fractional condensate depletion and superfluid fraction as a function of filling has interesting behavior .",
    "we find that the cases of @xmath236 and 1/2 behave differently from the cases of @xmath110 and 1/4 .",
    "surprisingly , for the cases of smaller @xmath3 , the fractional condensate depletion becomes a nonmonotonic function of the filling , decreasing as we increase @xmath4 from zero but eventually _ increases _ as @xmath235 .",
    "in fact , if we formally set @xmath36 , then the computed fractional depletion exceeds 100% for the @xmath112 case as @xmath4 approaches @xmath7 .",
    "we also have some evidence that the same behavior occurs in the @xmath285 case for small system sizes .",
    "in other words , our results raise the possibility , for @xmath286 , of a second - order phase transition to a non - condensed state where quantum fluctuations are large enough to destroy bose condensation .",
    "it is intriguing to note that this case does not have a halsey - type classical ground state and in fact has two degenerate ground states with different phase patterns .",
    "one can speculate that the motion of domain walls between the two different phase patterns may contribute to a route to decondensation and/or loss of superfluidity .",
    "finally , we note that fractional quantum hall states are expected when the number of vortices becomes comparable to the number of atoms or holes in the bose - hubbard model . in our large-@xmath0 theory ,",
    "the boson number is proportional to @xmath0 and so the quantum hall regime , if it exists in such a theory , exists only when @xmath287 .",
    "therefore , one might expect the condensate depletion or the reduction in the superfluid fraction to be large as @xmath235 .",
    "we do not find this directly in our perturbative theory in @xmath1 .",
    "however , our results for the fluctuations around non - halsey - type ground states suggest that an instability to a non - condensed state may be possible",
