    "the most successful cheating strategy against non - relativistic bit commitment schemes is the entanglement attack ( also known as the epr attack ) @xcite @xcite . in this strategy ,",
    "one of the parties ( alice ) entangles a system with the one she uses for commitment and keeps this second system secret .",
    "then she is able to cheat before the opening phase through local operations on her own system .",
    "one approach to counter this cheating strategy is to determine a means of breaking the entanglements .",
    "this must be done either through local transforms performed by the other party ( bob ) , or through local noise applied to bob s system ( from the transmission channel ) .",
    "entanglement breaking channels are a relatively new concept in quantum information that were first introduced in @xcite .",
    "the characteristics of two - qubit entanglements are discussed in @xcite and @xcite . in particular , the local two - qubit entanglement - annihilating channel ( 2-lea )",
    "is examined in @xcite .",
    "> from @xcite , a local channel @xmath0 is called entanglement breaking if the output of the channel operating on an entangled state is separable , where separability for a density matrix @xmath1 means @xmath2 . in the next section",
    ", we describe through an example how an entanglement breaking channel can be used to secure the bennett and brassard bit commitment scheme @xcite against an epr attack .",
    "as is typical , we assume alice is working in a noise free environment , i.e. , a perfectly shielded and isolated lab . therefore the joint noise which corrupts the entangled state @xmath3 is @xmath4 $ ] , where @xmath5 is the channel noise .",
    "this entanglement breaking operation must either be applied by bob through some apparatus he possesses for adding noise , or by the quantum channel through which alice sends the qubits to bob , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "here we use a depolarizing channel to apply the entanglement breaking operation .",
    "this channel is defined in @xcite as @xmath6\\frac{1}{2}i\\ ] ] the action of the depolarizing channel replaces the qubit with the completely mixed state , @xmath7 , with probability @xmath8 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite@xcite that the evolution of any entangled state in a channel ( entanglement breaking channel in this case ) , is determined by the evolution of a maximally entangled state in the channel .",
    "therefore we only consider the effect of the entanglement breaking channel on the maximally entangled state @xmath9 , where the subscripts @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote alice and bob , respectively .",
    "it was proven in @xcite for a local quantum channel @xmath12 ( which operates on a qubit ) , an entangled state @xmath13 ( which is a bipartite @xmath14 state ) , and concurrence @xmath15 as defined in @xcite ( a measure of entanglement ) , that @xmath16)=c[\\vert x\\rangle\\langle x\\vert]]c[(i\\otimes \\mathbb{s})[\\vert \\psi^+\\rangle \\langle \\psi^+ \\vert]].\\ ] ] since @xmath17=0 $ ] for @xmath13 , which is a separable state , if a local channel @xmath12 ( or @xmath18 for the entire system ) applied on the maximally entangled state @xmath19 disentangles it , then we have @xmath20)=0 $ ] , which disentangles any bipartite @xmath14 state .    having a maximally entangled state @xmath19 and applying a depolarizing channel on bob s state ( which means the effect of the channel on the entire system is @xmath21 $ ] ) , results in the state @xmath22 which has been shown to be separable for @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "therefore as discussed above , this channel will disentangle bob s qubit from any other system ( such as alice s secret system ) .",
    "now assume the two parties use the simple bennett and brassard bit commitment scheme in which alice sends random selections of @xmath24 or @xmath25 for 0 , and @xmath26 or @xmath27 for 1 .",
    "since @xmath28 , if @xmath1 passes through the channel bob will expect to receive @xmath29\\frac{1}{2}i$ ] .",
    "thus if alice attempts to cheat ( i.e. , entangle her secret system with bob s qubit ) , he will receive a separable state after applying the depolarizing channel ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "therefore the states of alice will be disentangled from bob s system , and more importantly he can determine if alice has cheated or not . to show this ,",
    "two cases must be considered , alice is honest and has not cheated , and alice attempts to cheat .",
    "for the first case , the probability of bob receiving the same state as alice sent is @xmath31",
    ". therefore the probability of bob measuring the correct state is @xmath32 since the probability of choosing the correct basis is @xmath33 .",
    "bob should then expect to measure at least @xmath32 of the states correctly . in the second case , alice cheats and",
    "entangles her secret states with the committed qubits .",
    "after bob performs the depolarizing operation , the state will be disentangled as described previously , and therefore alice can not change the state that bob measures .",
    "there is also no guarantee that the probability of bob measuring the correct state is @xmath32 , so alice may be exposed regarding the entanglements even if she does not change the committed bit .",
    "a simple security analysis regarding our example using the bennet and brassard scheme is given below .",
    "alice prepares an entangled state @xmath34 , where the subscript @xmath10 means the state is controlled by alice and @xmath11 controlled by bob .",
    "alice then sends bob s states to him , and when she wants to change her mind about the committed bit she performs a unitary transform followed by a projective measurement on her own state ( we can just assume a projective measurement ) .",
    "the effect of the entanglement breaking channel on the system after alice s measurement is @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the basis for the projective measurement .",
    "thus in order for alice to determine @xmath37 she needs to know the decomposition caused by the channel , i.e. , @xmath30 , and therefore she needs to know the value of @xmath31 ( which we assume is controlled by bob ) .",
    "chailloux and kerenidis @xcite provided lower bounds on an optimal quantum bit commitment ( the bounds are tight and the upper bounds are close to the lower bounds ) , however they assumed that the operations in both the commitment and revealing phases are * unitary transforms * on alice and bob s quantum spaces . here",
    "we take the same approach towards analysing the security of our system . for the hiding property ( i.e. the ability of bob to guess the committed bit assuming a honest alice ) , we know that without considering the channel bob can guess the bit with probability @xmath38 ( where @xmath39 is the density matrix assigned to 0 or 1 ) .",
    "the effect of the channel , bob s ability to cheat is then simply the maximum of his ability to distinguish the states with or without having them passed through the quantum channel , which is given by + @xmath40,\\mathbb{s}[\\sigma_1])}{2})$ ] + where @xmath41 $ ] is the effect of the channel . for alice s cheating probability , consider the following .",
    "+ we assume a cheating alice prepares a state @xmath3 and sends it to bob so that just before alice opens the bit , the state of that part of the system which bob possesses is @xmath42)$ ] where @xmath43 $ ] is alice s operation on her own part of the system ( i.e. a unitary transform followed by a measurement ) . now assuming that @xmath41 $ ] is an entanglement breaking channel , we have @xmath44)\\otimes \\rho_b^i$ ] .",
    "assuming alice wants bob to measure 0 , she should maximize the probability of bob detecting @xmath45 , which is @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the fidelity .",
    "this means alice must know the @xmath48 and properly choose the value of @xmath49)$ ] ( i.e. she also needs to know the @xmath50 ) .",
    "this requires alice to know the channel characteristics , but these are controlled by bob and is kept secret by him .",
    "in this letter we have shown that by using an entanglement breaking channel , the simple bennett and brassard bit commitment scheme can be made secure against epr attacks .",
    "we also presented an example of a depolarizing channel which is practically conceivable .",
    "only entanglement attacks were discussed , we leave the unconditional security of these noise based systems as a topic for future research .",
