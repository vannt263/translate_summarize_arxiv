    "hadronic final states in @xmath10 annihilation have been intensively studied in recent years , both at lep and slc , in order to perform qcd tests and to determine @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "interesting studies on bottom flavoured hadronic events have also been performed , in order to test the flavour independence of the strong coupling constant and to search for `` running mass '' effects  @xcite . however , up to now , heavy flavoured jets have been studied with the same tools used to study light flavoured jets .",
    "for example , the same shape variables used for light - quark jets ( like thrust , cluster multiplicities , etc . )",
    "have been applied to heavy flavoured events . on the other hand ,",
    "heavy flavoured events may have some advantages , because the kinematic distributions of the produced heavy quark can be computed theoretically with much better accuracy than the corresponding light - quark quantities .",
    "furthermore , the kinematic of the final - state heavy flavoured hadron is more closely related to that of the final - state quark , since hadronization effects involve energy scales that are much smaller than the quark mass .",
    "recently , the sld collaboration  @xcite has published preliminary data on the double inclusive @xmath0-@xmath1 production , and studied quantities ( proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) that carry information about the angular dependence of the @xmath0-@xmath1 energy correlations . the main purpose of the present work is to demonstrate that a slight variant of the quantities introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite has suitable properties to perform a novel , heavy - flavour - specific determination of the strong coupling constant",
    ". we will demonstrate the following facts :    * the observables we are considering have a well - defined , finite expansion in the strong coupling constant . * non - perturbative corrections of order @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the heavy - quark mass , cancel in these variables .",
    "the only remaining non - perturbative corrections are of order @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the centre - of - mass energy .",
    "* potentially large terms , enhanced by powers of @xmath15 , cancel at all orders in perturbation theory , provided @xmath3 is evaluated at a scale near @xmath14 .",
    "this cancellation holds as long as one can neglect multiple heavy - flavour pair production in our process , which is certainly the case for @xmath16 production in @xmath6 decays .",
    "the quantities we are considering have a well defined massless limit , provided one can neglect multiple heavy - flavour pair production .",
    "this limitation is what makes these quantities heavy - flavour specific .",
    "in fact , only for heavy flavours multiple pair production is truly negligible .",
    "thus , although these quantities have formally a well defined massless limit , they can not be used in a straightforward way to study light - flavour production .",
    "tools to compute heavy - flavour production at the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) level have been available in the literature for the past few years  @xcite .",
    "we have used our calculations  @xcite in order to compute the nlo corrections to the observables we propose .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : double_inclusive ] , we define the variables we are considering and show that their perturbative expansion in terms of the strong coupling constant @xmath17 is well behaved , and free from large logarithms of the ratio of the quark mass over the centre - of - mass energy .",
    "the sld collaboration has provided us with ( preliminary ) data for these new variables  @xcite , and thus we have been able to check our nlo predictions against the data .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : m_to_zero ] we investigate the massless limit of these variables , and show explicitly that potentially large logarithms cancel out .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : th_uncertainties ] we study theoretical uncertainties of our results .",
    "we analyze the dependence of the nlo results on the renormalization scale and compare the results obtained with the pole - mass definition to those obtained using the @xmath18  mass , addressing the question of which of the two mass definitions is more suitable for this calculation . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we give our conclusions .    in appendix",
    "[ app : coefficients ] , we collect some leading order ( lo ) formulae used in our analysis , and in appendix  [ app : as_renorm ] we comment on the renormalization scheme used in this paper .",
    "heavy flavoured hadron production proceeds through the process @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 is a heavy quark of mass @xmath12 ) followed by the hadronization of the final heavy quarks . in the following we will focus upon @xmath0 meson production .    defining the @xmath0 hadron scaled energy @xmath21 , we consider the following quantities   and @xmath22 were also considered in  @xcite and the ratios @xmath23 in  @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath24 where @xmath25 is the differential cross section for the final - state hadron production , @xmath26 is the angle between the two hadrons , @xmath27 the total cross section and @xmath28 are the scaled energies of the two final @xmath0 hadrons .",
    "the quantities studied by the authors of  @xcite are related to the ratios @xmath29 by a calculable perturbative factor ( @xmath30 in the notation of  @xcite ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite these ratios were compared to experimental results . however , these quantities have a few drawbacks .",
    "first of all , they depend upon a `` theoretical '' factor . it would be preferable to deal with quantities that have an experimental definition , free of theoretical assumptions .",
    "second and most important , they have a perturbative expansion that starts at leading order with a constant .",
    "therefore , even when corrected at the nlo level , they would allow only for a lo determination of @xmath3 .",
    "conversely , they can be used to test the production mechanism , since in the ratios @xmath3 cancels at first approximation .    in this work",
    ", we claim that the quantities @xmath23 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : g_ij_def ] ) , should instead be studied in order to perform precision qcd tests .",
    "we will in fact show in the following that these quantities have a perturbative expansion in @xmath31 with coefficients that remain finite even in the limit of large @xmath32 ratios .",
    "we write the hadronic differential cross sections as @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 are the quark differential cross section and the quark scaled energies .",
    "the quark differential cross sections @xmath34 are calculable order - by - order in perturbative qcd , since the heavy - quark mass @xmath12 acts as a cut - off for final - state collinear singularities . however , in order to go from the qcd partonic cross section @xmath37 to the hadronic one @xmath25 , we have to take into consideration non - perturbative effects , of order @xmath11 , that are present in the hadronic cross section .",
    "we assume that all these effects are described by a non - perturbative fragmentation function @xmath38 .    the quark differential cross sections , although calculable , contain logarithmically enhanced terms of the form @xmath39 , so that their perturbative expansion is not well behaved for @xmath40 .    in the quantities @xmath41",
    "these large logarithms cancel , together with the dependence upon the non - perturbative fragmentation function .",
    "this is a consequence of the factorization theorem , if one makes the additional assumption that secondary production of heavy - flavour pairs is negligible , which is in fact the case at the @xmath6 peak .",
    "the factorization theorem states that mass singularities in inclusive cross sections can be absorbed into process independent , universal factors . in our case ,",
    "mass singularities are precisely the @xmath15 terms .",
    "thus , for @xmath40 we have @xmath42 where the hatted cross sections do not depend upon @xmath12 , and all terms that are large in the @xmath43 limit ( i.e.  terms proportional to powers of @xmath15 ) are absorbed in the fragmentation functions @xmath44  . inserting eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dsigma_b ] ) and  ( [ eq : dsigma3_b ] ) into eqs .",

    "( [ eq : g_ij_def ] ) ) , the @xmath51 factors ( that contain mass singularities ) cancel out , leaving a finite expression  .",
    "terms suppressed by powers of @xmath12 and enhanced by powers of @xmath15 may still ( and in fact are ) present in @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , uncalculable effects of order @xmath13 may still be present . ] .",
    "since non - perturbative effects cancel in the definition of @xmath23 , from now on we will make no distinction between the quantities @xmath52 , @xmath22 defined at the quark and at the hadron level . with the available codes for the calculation of nlo corrections in the production of heavy quarks  @xcite at @xmath53 colliders  , we can compute the contributions up to order @xmath54 to the quantities @xmath52 , @xmath55 and @xmath41 .",
    "we can write the perturbative expansions for @xmath52 and @xmath55 for massive final - state quarks , renormalized in the pole - mass scheme , in the region away from the two - jet final state ( the two parton final state gives a contribution proportional to @xmath56 ) as d_i & = & 1-a_i + , + [ eq : d_ij_expans ] d_ij()&=&b_ij()+ c_ij()+2 b_0 b_ij()@xmath57 ( ) ^2 + & & + o(_s^3 ) , , so that the expression for @xmath23 becomes [ eq : g_ij_expans ] g_ij ( ) & = & b_ij()+ \\ { c_ij ( ) + & & + 2 b_0@xmath57+a_i+a_jb_ij ( ) } ( ) ^2 + o(_s^3 ) , where b_0 = , @xmath58 is the renormalization scale , @xmath59 for an su(3 ) gauge theory , @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the number of active flavours .",
    "we observe that expanding the ratio in powers of @xmath3 is essential to implement the cancellation of large logarithms in @xmath23 order - by - order in the perturbative series .",
    "if we had not done so , the numerator and denominator of @xmath23 would contain large logarithms at some fixed order , and their ratio would be misleading ( i.e.  it would be sensitive to higher order terms with higher powers of logarithms ) .    in fig .  [",
    "fig : g_ij ] we have plotted @xmath23 at leading and next - to - leading order in @xmath3 , for @xmath62 , at a renormalization scale @xmath63  gev , using @xmath64 , with @xmath65 active flavours .",
    "the nlo curves are in good agreement with the sld preliminary data .",
    "conversely , the sld data can be used to extract the value of @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , from the knowledge of the numerical values of the coefficients of the @xmath3 and @xmath54 contributions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : g_ij_expans ] ) , we can fit @xmath41 to the data , keeping @xmath3 as a free parameter .",
    "we have computed tables for the @xmath3 and @xmath54 coefficients of eq .",
    "( [ eq : g_ij_expans ] ) , that can be used in a more detailed analysis .",
    "these tables ( and the programs to generate them ) can be obtained from the authors .",
    "we should mention here that , in the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath16 quark is treated as a heavy particle , and thus does not contribute to the running of the coupling constant .",
    "thus , in principle , one should use this calculation in conjunction with the 4-flavour coupling constant @xmath67 . since we are dealing with @xmath6",
    "decays , however , secondary @xmath16-quark pairs may in fact be produced ( from gluon splitting ) , and when this happens , they behave , in some sense , as light flavours , contributing terms that effectively modify the running of @xmath3 .    in fig .  [",
    "fig : secondaryb ] , we show the feynman graphs for secondary heavy - flavour production , giving rise to four massive - quark final state .    the graphs in fig .",
    "[ fig : secondaryb ] also appear with the two identical quarks and/or the two identical antiquarks exchanged .",
    "when taking the amplitude squared , this gives rise to two interference terms .",
    "their contribution is known to be extremely small , and will be neglected in the following .",
    "in addition , virtual @xmath16-quark loops arise only in the self - energy insertion of the emitted ( on - shell ) gluon .",
    "their contribution is zero in the renormalization scheme we use , since , in this scheme , the heavy flavour decouples for small momenta ( see appendix  [ app : as_renorm ] for more details ) .",
    "thus , the only effect of the heavy flavour is given by the graphs of fig .",
    "[ fig : secondaryb ] .    in the quantities we are considering , the possibility of detecting secondary ( instead of primary ) @xmath0 mesons has little impact , since secondary @xmath0 s are very soft . if we make the approximation of neglecting effects that are suppressed by powers of the mass in the secondary @xmath16 line , the contribution of the graphs of fig .",
    "[ fig : secondaryb ] ( without interference ) is easily included using the following prescription :    * compute the cross section with the number of light flavours @xmath68 equal to 5 ; * use the 5 flavour coupling @xmath69 ; * do not include any other graph with secondary heavy flavours .",
    "in essence , the prescription amounts to including the secondary heavy flavour by simply increasing @xmath68 by one . when doing this , one in fact is also changing the renormalization scheme for the heavy flavour , by treating it as if it were light .",
    "thus , the correct coupling constant to use in this framework is @xmath69 . in appendix  [ app : as_renorm ]",
    "we discuss this change of scheme in more detail and from a slightly different point of view .",
    "secondary @xmath16-quark production may also arise from primary light quarks , connected with the @xmath70 vertex .",

    ", this is a very difficult question to answer . in inclusive processes , in general ,",
    "the @xmath18  mass is better , since it accounts for large powers of logarithms of @xmath91 multiplying powers of the mass at all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "the case we are considering , however , is not an inclusive process , since we are weighting the cross section with final - state kinematic variables .",
    "we are thus unable to give a full answer to this question .",

    "it is quite clear from the figure that the logarithmic slope is smaller for the pole - mass scheme .",
    "furthermore , the radiative correction to the mass term is always smaller for the pole - mass scheme than for the @xmath18  scheme .",
    "we thus conclude that the quantities @xmath76 seem to be more naturally described in the pole - mass scheme rather than in the @xmath18-mass scheme .",
    "in this paper we have investigated new measurable quantities ( related to the quantities introduced in ref .",

    "we have investigated the renormalization - scale and mass - scheme dependence of our results , and found that , varying the renormalization scale @xmath58 in the range @xmath103 , the scale dependence of @xmath89 is reduced from roughly @xmath104 at leading order to @xmath105 at next - to - leading order .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties related to the mass definition are less than 4% at nlo .",
    "we have shown that these quantities seem to be more naturally described in the pole - mass rather than in the @xmath18-mass scheme .    from the discussion given in this paper",
    ", one may wonder if similar quantities may be defined for massless quarks , given the fact that mass singularities cancel in the variables we are considering , and thus they remain well defined in the massless limit .",
    "this is not quite the case .",
    "in fact , it is crucial for our discussion that the secondary heavy - flavour production may be neglected .",
    "if this were not the case , evolution of the fragmentation function would become multi - dimensional , involving several flavour components and a singlet contribution .",
    "thus , the advantage of having a heavy flavour in the final state lies in the fact that the evolution becomes essentially non - singlet , so that we are left with a single component of the fragmentation function , that simply cancels in the ratios we propose .",

    "<S> motivated by recent preliminary results from the sld collaboration on the measurement of angle - dependent @xmath0-@xmath1 energy correlations in @xmath2 events , we propose a class of observables that can be computed as a power expansion in the strong coupling constant @xmath3 , of order @xmath3 at the born level and that can be used for a precision measurement of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we compute their next - to - leading order @xmath5 corrections in the strong coupling constant , including exactly quark - mass effects . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , in the theoretical evaluation of these quantities , large logarithms of the ratio of the mass of the final quark over the centre - of - mass energy cancel out . </S>",
    "<S> thus , these variables have a well - behaved perturbative expansion in @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we study the theoretical uncertainties due to the renormalization - scale dependence and the quark - mass scheme and we address the question of which mass scheme is more appropriate for these variables .    * on a possible measurement of @xmath3 from @xmath0-@xmath1 correlations in @xmath6 decay *    .5 cm    a.  brandenburg@xmath7 , p.  nason@xmath8 and c.  oleari@xmath9    .5 cm _ @xmath7desy - theorie , 22603 hamburg , germany + @xmath8infn , sezione di milano , piazza della scienza 3 , 20126 milan , italy + @xmath9department of physics , ippp , south road , durham dh1 3le , uk _ </S>"
