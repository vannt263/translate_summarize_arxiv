    "# 1@xmath6    new neutral ( @xmath0 ) and charged ( @xmath7 ) gauge bosons are a generic prediction of theories beyond the standard model . if their mass turns out to be in the tev region future hadron colliders ( the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern ) as well as @xmath8 colliders ( the new large collider ( nlc ) ) would provide an ideal environment for their discovery as well as for further testing of their properties .    in recent years it has been demonstrated that for @xmath9 tev a diagnostic study of heavy gauge bosons is possible at the lhc ( integrated luminosity @xmath10 fb@xmath11 , center of mass energy @xmath12 tev)@xcite as well as at the nlc ( @xmath13 fb@xmath11 , @xmath14 gev ) @xcite . both machines turn out to have complementary diagnostic power for @xmath0 physics @xcite .    for @xmath15",
    "tev the future colliders allow for model independent determination of gauge couplings to quarks and leptons .",
    "the analysis assumes family universality ; @xmath16=0 $ ] , where @xmath17 is the @xmath18 charge and @xmath19 are the generators of @xmath20 ; and that @xmath21 mixing is negligible .",
    "the lhc can probe the absolute magnitude of the overall strength of the new interaction @xmath22 , as well as the magnitude of ( primarily ) three out of four normalized gauge couplings . on the other hand ,",
    "the nlc with longitudinal electron beam polarization and heavy flavor tagging available is sensitive to the ratio of @xmath23 and four normalized gauge couplings .",
    "the latter can also be determined in terms of normalized couplings probed directly at the lhc ; the error bars are typically smaller by a factor of @xmath24 than those at the nlc @xcite , but there is a few - fold ambiguity .",
    "thus , the lhc and the nlc are complementary and together have the potential to uniquely determine the couplings with small error - bars .",
    "for @xmath25 tev the error bars are in the 10%-20% region .    in this note",
    "we point out that a model independent determination of gauge couplings in turn provides a tool to learn more about the nature of the extended gauge structure .",
    "in particular , one would be able to gain information about the underlying gauge group and subsequently probe the type of symmetry breaking associated with the new heavy gauge boson .    to illustrate the method we study as a prime example the cartan subalgebra of the @xmath1 gauge group , which provides a general enough framework for grand unified symmetry with canonical embedding of electric charge and simple cancellation of anomalies .",
    "in addition , it is motivated by string theory .",
    "@xmath1 imposes two discrete constraints on the @xmath0 gauge couplings .",
    "provided these are satisfied by the measured couplings , one can further determine the two parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "these two parameters , together with the overall strength of the new gauge couplings @xmath22 , contain the information brought by the new interaction concerning the pattern of symmetry breaking , possible intermediate mass scales , and renormalization effects above the @xmath0 .",
    "this window to higher scales , as in the case of the weak angle , is not sufficient to fix the full theory at the planck scale , but it should allow for constraining possible unification schemes , excluding many possibilities .",
    "see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of the predictions for the new parameters of extended models from the heterotic string .    in section",
    "ii we spell out the formalism and parameterization of the @xmath0 interaction with the corresponding quark and lepton neutral currents . in section iii we recapitulate the results for the model independent determination of gauge couplings . in section",
    "iv we illustrate how such couplings allow for a determination of the underlying gauge symmetry and subsequently for determination of the symmetry breaking pattern with a particular gauge structure .",
    "conclusions are given in section v.",
    "the coupling of an additional neutral gauge boson @xmath0 and the neutral standard model bosons @xmath26 to ordinary fermions are parameterized in the neutral current lagrangian as @xcite : @xmath27 \\psi _ k , \\label{lag}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the standard model isospin and hypercharge charges , respectively , and @xmath17 is the charge of the extra @xmath18 .",
    "a sum over all the quarks and leptons @xmath30 is implied .",
    "this lagrangian describes the general coupling of a new gauge boson @xmath0 with charge @xmath17 which commutes with the @xmath20 generators @xmath19 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath31 = 0 $ ] .",
    "this is the case for all of the extended gauge structures for which the generator of the @xmath18 associated with @xmath0 lies in its cartan subalgebra . in the following we also assume family universality and neglect @xmath21 mixing , as indicated by present bounds@xcite and the expected accuracy at future colliders .",
    "the @xmath0 couplings are specified by the ( normalized ) charges @xmath32 and the overall strength @xmath22 , as well as by @xmath33 , which is the coupling of @xmath0 to the weak hypercharge .",
    "thus , the neutral current lagrangian of the ordinary fermions , which includes an additional gauge boson , is specified by five charges @xmath34 and the relative strength of the @xmath0 gauge coupling to the hypercharge @xmath29 and the @xmath17 currents , @xmath35 .",
    "the charges @xmath32 are characteristic of the underlying extended gauge structure .",
    "@xmath32 charges for typical models based on @xmath36 and @xmath1 grand unified symmetries are given in table [ charges ] .",
    "the @xmath36 symmetry includes the general _ left - right _ symmetric models with @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the ratio of the gauge couplings @xmath39 for @xmath40 , respectively . in general , @xmath41 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath42 and @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the weak angle .    for a particular extended gauge symmetry",
    "the charges @xmath32 are fixed numbers which usually satisfy specific constraints .",
    "for @xmath36 the @xmath32 satisfy the four conditions : @xmath45 whereas for @xmath1 only the first three are satisfied in general .",
    "the gauge couplings , @xmath46 , specify the overall strength of the interactions .",
    "they are fixed at the large scale , where the full underlying gauge structure is present , _",
    "e.g. _ , in string theory the gauge couplings of all the group factors are related at the string compactification scale . however , these couplings are renormalized at low energies , where their values crucially depend on the matter content , the symmetry breaking pattern , and the threshold effects .",
    "in particular , @xmath33 may vanish at the large scale , but it is in general non - zero at low energy .",
    "it allows for description of the _ left - right _ models ( see eq .",
    "( [ lrm ] ) ) within the @xmath36 symmetry .",
    "introduction of @xmath33 is also necessary for a complete parameterization of low energy models when only the extended gauge structure or its cartan subalgebra , within which @xmath17 lies , is known , which parameterizes the strength of the @xmath47 coupling to the neutral currents specified by @xmath17 , can be set to zero .",

    "@xmath48 , hypercharge @xmath29 , and @xmath17 charges for ordinary quarks and leptons .",
    "@xmath49 specifies the additional @xmath36 charge , whereas @xmath50 is the additional charge in the breaking of @xmath1 to @xmath36 .",
    "thus , @xmath51 is the general @xmath1 charge .",

    "the fitted values for @xmath56 and @xmath3 have smaller uncertainties . in table",
    "[ sigmal ] the corresponding 1 @xmath57 uncertainties are given in parentheses .",
    "the uncertainties are now reduced by a factor of 1 to 5 compared to the step one analysis . in figure [ lhcbvd ] the @xmath58 confidence level ( @xmath59 ) contours in @xmath56 _ vs. _ @xmath60 are plotted with solid lines .",
    "the parameters can be determined with a precision of about a few percent .",
    "for the typical models the uncertainties are smaller than those at the nlc ( see figure [ nlcbvd ] ) .",
    "although the overall strength of the @xmath0 gauge couplings does not enter in the above analysis ( except for the estimate of typical statistical error ) , the overall strength of the interactions @xmath61 can also be measured at the lhc , by measuring the cross - section in the main production channel and the total width .",
    "determination of this coupling can be used to constrain further the symmetry breaking pattern@xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated how the model independent determination of gauge couplings of a possible @xmath0 at future colliders would allow one to gain information about the nature of the extended gauge structure associated with the @xmath0 .    as a prime case we study @xmath1 [ @xmath36 ] as the underlying gauge symmetry . in the case of @xmath1 [ @xmath36 ] @xmath0 gauge couplings have to satisfy two [ three ] discrete constraints .",
    "provided such constraints are satisfied , the parameters @xmath2 [ @xmath63 for @xmath36 ] and @xmath3 , which characterize the effects of the symmetry pattern within @xmath1 [ @xmath36 ] on the @xmath0 couplings , can be determined .    for @xmath25 2 tev and typical models the statistical uncertainties for parameters @xmath56 and @xmath3 are in the 0.010.04 range , once the corresponding discrete constraints are fixed .",
