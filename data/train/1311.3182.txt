    "vlasov equation is central in different areas of physics , notably plasma physics , where it is used with the coulomb potential , and astrophysics , where the newton potential is used instead . in this latter context , it is usually called `` collisionless boltzmann equation '' . understanding the asymptotic behavior of a perturbation to a stationary state of the vlasov equation is an old problem .",
    "a huge literature is devoted to the linearized dynamics , starting with the pioneering work of landau @xcite . the full non linear problem , despite a large literature ( for instance  @xcite ) , is still not fully understood .",
    "the subject has witnessed spectacular mathematical progresses recently .",
    "mouhot and villani  @xcite showed that if the initial condition is close , in some analytical norm , to a stable homogeneous stationary state , then the dynamics is an exponential relaxation towards another nearby stable homogeneous stationary state .",
    "lin and zeng in @xcite investigated weaker norms of the sobolev space @xmath2 with @xmath3 .",
    "they showed among other results that if the norm is weak enough ( precisely , @xmath4 ) , any neighborhood of a stable homogeneous stationary state also contains unstable homogeneous stationary states , as well as small bgk waves .",
    "in particular , complete damping for any initial condition , as in mouhot - villani s setting , is excluded .",
    "conversely , if @xmath5 , there is a neighborhood of the reference stable state that contains no unstable stationary states .",
    "all these impressive results hold for homogeneous stationary states : this is unfortunately a severe limitation , since it excludes all situations of interest for self - gravitating systems .",
    "a natural question is then : what could it be possible to show in the context of non - homogeneous stationary states ? first , any exponential relaxation as in @xcite is impossible , since one always expects an algebraic relaxation , already for the linearized problem @xcite .",
    "one may then conjecture an algebraic relaxation at the non linear level ( see @xcite for such a conjecture in the context of the 2d euler equation ) , but it seems difficult to prove .",
    "now , is an analysis in the spirit of @xcite possible ?",
    "again , the complexity of the linearized problem is a serious obstacle ( see for instance @xcite for a textbook account of the study of the linearized vlasov equation in astrophysics ) .",
    "however , a simple criterion for the stability of a large class of non - homogeneous stationary states has been found recently  @xcite , in the context of a simple toy model , called the hamiltonian mean - field model ( hmf ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to take advantage of this simple formulation to investigate the neighborhood of inhomogeneous stable stationary solutions in the case of the hmf model .",
    "this is a first partial advance , in the spirit of lin and zeng , for inhomogeneous stationary states .",
    "we will show that the results differ significantly from the homogeneous case : it is actually easier to rule out the presence of unstable states in a neighborhood of the reference stable state , since a @xmath0 norm may be sufficient .",
    "we state precisely our results in section  [ sec : results ] , emphasizing the important difference with the homogeneous case , and postpone the proofs to section  [ sec : proofs ] .",
    "section  [ sec : num ] presents some numerical illustration of our findings .",
    "the vlasov equation associated to the hmf model is @xmath6 and the one - body hamiltonian of the hmf model is @xmath7(t)\\cos ( q-\\varphi(t ) ) ,      \\quad      m[f](t ) e^{i\\varphi(t)}= \\iint_{\\mu } f(q , p , t)(\\cos q+i\\sin q ) dqdp,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 represents the phase space of the one - body system .",
    "* remark : *  note that @xmath9\\leq 1 $ ] .",
    "furthermore , thanks to the rotational symmetry of the hmf model , we may set the magnetization s phase to zero without loss of generality .",
    "we will always do so in the following .",
    "* notation : *  if @xmath10 is stationary , the hamiltonian system @xmath11 is integrable , and we can introduce the angle - action variables @xmath12 .",
    "an integrable hamiltonian @xmath13 can be expressed as a function of @xmath14 only .",
    "we denote such a hamiltonian as @xmath15 .",
    "we also write @xmath16 .",
    "* remark : *  the phase space of hamiltonian presents a separatrix , at energy @xmath17 .",
    "strictly speaking , one must then define the angle - action variables separately in the different regions delimited by the separatrix .",

    ", we concentrate on the following special class of stationary solutions :    a function @xmath10 is called a monotonous stationary solution if it can be written as @xmath19 with @xmath20 a @xmath21 , real , strictly decreasing function , and if it is normalized : @xmath22 .",
    "note that a monotonous stationary solution @xmath10 is non - homogeneous in space if and only if @xmath23\\neq 0 $ ] .",
    "we further note that @xmath23=1 $ ] is excluded , since @xmath23=1 $ ] implies that @xmath10 is concentrated on the @xmath24-axis and hence @xmath10 is not @xmath25 . as will be clear in the following , these stationary solutions may be stable or unstable .",
    "this is a difference with 3d self gravitating systems , where stationary solutions that are strictly decreasing functions of the energy are always stable ( see @xcite for the most recent results in this direction ) .    to measure the distance between two stationary solutions",
    ", we will use the fractional sobolev spaces @xmath26 .",
    "in addition , we require that to be close to each other , two stationary solutions must not differ too much in their magnetization , which is rather natural . in the whole paper",
    ", we will use `` stable '' to mean `` formally stable '' .",
    "we can now state our main result .",

    "this is to be contrasted with the following statement concerning homogeneous stationary states :    [ theo : hom ] let @xmath10 be a homogeneous stable monotonous stationary state , such that @xmath34 , with @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "any neighborhood of @xmath10 in the @xmath26 norm contains an unstable monotonous homogeneous stationary state .    from theorem  [ theo : main ] , we see that using a norm that controls only one derivative of the distribution function is enough to ensure that a neighborhood of @xmath10 is `` simple '' , in the sense that it does not contain any unstable monotonous stationary state .",
    "by contrast , in the homogeneous case , even requiring more regularity ( with @xmath37 ) may not be enough .",
    "we have stated theorem  [ theo : hom ] in this way to emphasize the contrast with the non - homogeneous case .",
    "it is actually a much weaker and less general statement of the results in  @xcite",
    ". we will give a proof of it , because it is instructive and for self - consistency of the paper .",

    "* notation : *  we need to define the average over the angle @xmath42 variable , at fixed action @xmath14 ; for a function @xmath43 , we denote it as ( see sec .",

    "* discussion : * clearly , the proof of theorem  [ theo : main ] heavily relies on the stability criterion obtained in  @xcite .",
