    "in order to deduce reliable values of arrival time at earth for cme - related ejecta , it is first necessary to determine the cme departure speed from the sun where the phases of slow rise , acceleration , constant velocity , and deceleration all need to be considered .",
    "the problem is made more difficult by the fact that earth - directed events are so - called halo or partial - halo cmes that have a quasi - symmetric appearance around the solar disc when viewed in white light .",
    "thus it is more difficult to obtain true earthward velocities at the departure times of these events .",
    "a range of tools exists for the estimation of these speeds that are mostly applicable from the lower corona to distances up to @xmath0 10 @xmath1 .",
    "these include the observation of radio bursts in the dynamic spectra ( principally type ii bursts ) and the analysis of white - light images obtained with coronagraphs . for values , when the faster cmes are usually decelerating , the interplanetary scintillation ( ips ) technique can be used .",
    "while it is possible to track the expansion of euv or x - ray emitting plasmas by using appropriate imagers or by directly measuring velocities spectroscopically , these methods have been applied to cmes in just a few isolated cases .",
    "while we expect a greater use of both imaging and spectroscopy in the future , through data obtained by the _ hinode _ and stereo missions , neither of these latter methods has been employed for the events discussed here .",
    "since it is important to understand the strengths and limitations of these methods before applying them to cme speed estimation , it is necessary to briefly describe the underlying physics .",
    "we therefore present a short survey in the next section that outlines the basis for use of radio - burst dynamic spectra and white - light images for speed measurement . for @xmath2 50 @xmath1 ,",
    "use of the ips technique is most appropriate , and so we outline the basic features of that method .",
    "we then describe the application of these techniques to the events that had been selected for the sun - earth connection workshop ( in this topical issue ) , namely those of 28 october 2003 , 7 november 2004 , and 20 january 2005 , and the results obtained from the analysis .",
    "we conclude with a general discussion of all three halo cmes and the uncertainties in speed estimation .",
    "frontside `` halo '' cmes are directed towards the earth and appear as diffuse clouds that surround the solar disk in white - light images",
    ". some of them can be very geoeffective ( kim _ et al .",
    "_ , @xcite ; howard and tappin , @xcite ) .",
    "halo cmes are often very fast , the measured apparent speeds are 957 km s@xmath3 on average @xcite , which is about twice the mean cme speed .",
    "speed estimation can , however , be difficult @xcite , as cmes are observed in scattered white light on the plane of the sky , which is biased by projection effects , sideways expansion of the structure , and its propagation towards us .",
    "using both white - light and radio observations , the `` true '' cme speeds have in some studies been estimated to be higher than the measured plane - of - the - sky speeds @xcite .",
    "solar type ii bursts are slow - drift bursts visible in dynamic radio spectra , and they are generally attributed to shock - accelerated electrons ( wild and smerd , @xcite ; nelson and melrose , @xcite ) . a distinction can be made between coronal type ii bursts observed in the decimetric ",
    "metric wavelength range and interplanetary ( ip ) type ii bursts observed at decametric  hectometric ( dh ) wavelenghts .",
    "the driving agent of type ii bursts has also been under discussion : shock acceleration can be created by blast waves ( _ e.g. _ , a pressure pulse without mass motions driving the wave ) or piston - driven shocks ( mass propagating at super - alfvnic speed ) .",
    "there has been discussion on whether coronal shocks can survive into the ip space ( _ e.g. _ , mann _",
    "et al . _ , @xcite ; knock and cairns , @xcite ) .",
    "ip type ii bursts are usually ascribed to bow shocks driven ahead of a cme @xcite , while coronal type ii bursts have shown better temporal and spatial correlation with flare waves and ejecta ( _ e.g. _ , klassen , pohjolainen , and klein , @xcite ; cane and erickson , @xcite ; cliver _ et al . _ , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the early work on large - scale propagating transients was based on ips measurements of a large number of radio sources at low frequencies , applicable to relatively large distances from the sun ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , hewish , tappin , and gapper , @xcite ) .",
    "present - day measurements at higher frequencies provide cmes size , speed , turbulence level , and mass also closer to the sun , at distances @xmath2 50 @xmath1  ( _ e.g. _ , manoharan _ et al .",
    "_ , @xcite ; tokumaru _ et al . _ , @xcite ) .",
    "the regular monitoring of ips on a given radio source over several days provides variations of the solar wind speed and density turbulence at a large range of heliocentric distances from the sun .",
    "ips observations of a grid of large number of radio sources on consecutive days can provide three - dimensional images of the heliosphere at different radii .",
    "since the cme structures are seen in the plane of the sky , projection effects must be considered .",
    "several methods for calculating radial velocities have recently been proposed by , _",
    "e.g. _ , leblanc _ et al . _",
    "( @xcite ) , michaek , gopalswamy , and yashiro ( @xcite , symmetric cone model ) , schwenn _ et al . _",
    "( @xcite , lateral expansion speed ) , and michaek ( @xcite , asymmetric cone model ) .",
    "we selected the symmetric cone model by michaek , gopalswamy , and yashiro ( @xcite ) for estimating the `` true '' speeds assuming that for a halo cme , propagation is with constant velocity and angular width , and the bulk velocity is directed radially and isotropic .",
    "if the launch location of the cme is slightly shifted along the cone symmetry axis by a distance @xmath4 with respect to sun centre , the initial and final appearance of the halo cme will be at the opposite limbs on this axis .",
    "using measured plane - of - the - sky velocities at diametrically opposite limbs and the time difference , @xmath5@xmath6 between first and last appearance , the cone model may be used to determine @xmath4 along with _ i _ ) @xmath7 , the angle between the symmetry axis and the plane - of - the - sky , _ ii _ ) @xmath8 , the opening angle of the cone , and _ iii _ ) @xmath9 , the radial cme velocity .    in view of the difficulty in estimating @xmath5@xmath6 , given the relatively poor cadence of lasco measurements , and",
    "since the active - region launch sites were identified for the events , we established @xmath4 from mdi magnetogram and eit image data , thus allowing an estimate of @xmath7 from the relation @xmath10 = @xmath11@xmath1 .",
    "values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 were then deduced from the equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) of michaek , gopalswamy , and yashiro ( @xcite ) .",
    "in fact the application of this technique was possible for only one of our events , that of 7 november 2004 .",
    "for the event of 28 october 2003 , only three useable lasco c3 frames were available and the velocities at opposite limbs were essentially the same , making it impossible to apply the cone model . in the case of the event of 20 january 2005 ,",
    "only one useful lasco frame was available .",
    "the general idea behind type ii bursts is that they are created by a propagating shock : langmuir waves are excited by electron beams produced in this shock and the waves are then converted into escaping radio waves ( melrose @xcite ; cairns _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the emission mechanism is plasma emission near the fundamental and second - harmonic frequencies .",
    "the plasma frequency @xmath12 ( hz ) at the fundamental is directly related to the electron density @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) by @xmath15 and a frequency drift towards the lower frequencies shows that the electron density is falling .",
    "this change is usually attributed to the burst driver moving in the solar atmosphere towards lower densities and larger heights .",
    "type ii bursts are therefore a valuable tool in determining burst ( shock ) velocities .",
    "identifying the fundamental emission lane in dynamic radio spectra can be tricky ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , robinson , @xcite ) .",
    "firstly not all type ii bursts show emission at the fundamental and second harmonic ( second harmonic should be near 2@xmath12 ) , and due to the limited observing frequencies it is possible that one or the other lane is not visible in the spectrum .",
    "the dh type ii bursts are characterised by weaker emission than their metric counterparts , and the emission lanes are often split into a series of patches . in metric bursts",
    "the harmonic band can be stronger than the fundamental , but in dh bursts it is usually the opposite ( see vrsnak _ et al . _ , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "both the fundamental and second harmonic can show band - splitting ( vrsnak _ et al .",
    "_ , @xcite ; @xcite ; vrsnak , magdalenic , and zlobec , @xcite ) .",
    "sometimes rapidly drifting emission stripes called `` herringbones '' can be observed over a type ii burst `` backbone '' ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , cairns and robinson , @xcite ; mann and klassen , @xcite ) .",
    "ground - based observations at decimetric - metric wavelengths are also easily affected by radio interference .",
    "after calculating the electron density from the plasma frequency at the fundamental , the next step is to find a corresponding height for the emitting source .",
    "this is done with the help of atmospheric density models .",
    "which model to use is a well - known problem , see , _ e.g. _ , robinson and stewart ( @xcite ) and references therein .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows how density depends strongly on coronal conditions : it is important to know if the disturbance is propagating in a less - dense equatorial region , inside a dense streamer region , or in even denser coronal - loop structures .",
    "also the turbulent afterflows of a previous cme can affect the densities .",
    "the most widely used density models are by newkirk ( @xcite ) and saito ( @xcite ) . in the newkirk model ,",
    "the electron number densities stay high at large distances from the sun since the model is a hydrostatic one , see figure  [ fig1 ] .     according to the ip density model , with near - earth electron densities of 5 @xmath14 ( solar minimum ) and 50 @xmath14 ( solar maximum).,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    the observed density values near 1 au are much less than in the corona ( see , _ e.g. _ , mann _",
    "_ @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the large density decreases are mainly due to solar - wind densities . in interplanetary ( ip )",
    "space a commonly - used approximation @xmath16 leads to @xmath17 , and in this case the plasma density @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) scales as @xmath18 where @xmath19 ( @xmath14 ) is the plasma density near earth at 1 au , and @xmath20 ( in au ) is the distance from the sun ( _ e.g. _ , reiner _",
    "et al . _ , @xcite ) .",
    "the value of @xmath21 ranges from @xmath225 @xmath14 around solar minimum to ten times this value at solar maximum .",
    "the model of saito ( @xcite ) departs significantly in ip space from the @xmath23 scaling .",
    "a revised model by saito , poland , and munro ( @xcite ) is similar to that of saito ( @xcite ) in the @xmath24 = 1.210 @xmath1 range , but the densities get closer to the @xmath16 relation at larger distances .",
    "also the model by leblanc , dulk , and bougeret ( @xcite ) gives too low densities for the active region corona ( the authors recommend not to use it below @xmath221.2 @xmath1 ) , but it is similar to the ip model at distances @xmath25 30 @xmath1 .",
    "a  hybrid - model \" by vrsnak , magdalenic , and zlobec ( @xcite ) is a mixture of a five - fold saito and the leblanc , dulk , and bougeret models , with small modifications , and it can be used for connecting bursts in the corona and the ip space .",
    "both give an electron density of 7 @xmath14 near 1 au , which is a commonly observed value during activity minimum .",
    ".from plasma frequency to heliocentric burst driver height ( @xmath1 ) with different atmospheric density models [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the estimated radio source heights are also in agreement with the cme heights on 28 october 2003 .",
    "the calculated shock velocity from the dh type ii burst at 11:1611:21 ut ( 3600 km s@xmath3 ) indicates a shock speed only somewhat higher than the cme speed observed after 11:30 ut ( 2900 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "the white - light cme was also observed to decelerate .",
    "since the high - speed full - halo cme was propagating in the wake of the earlier partial - halo cme , the high momentary speed could reflect temporary acceleration or abrupt changes in the local density .",
    "estimation of the continuation of the dh type - ii - burst lane suggests that the shock was much slower ( 2600 km s@xmath3 ) later on .",
    "the source locations at decimetric - metric wavelengths on 28 october 2003 have recently been analysed by pick _",
    "( @xcite ) , who discovered that the radio sources outline an h@xmath8-moreton wave , which is a direct signature of a propagating shock wave at the photospheric level ( see _ e.g. _ uchida , @xcite ) .",
    "the average speed of the moreton wave was around 2000 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the authors also report type iii bursts where the burst envelope moves with a speed of 2500 km s@xmath3 , in the same direction ( southwest ) as the most compact ( brightest ) cme structure .",
    "therefore it is plausible that the burst envelope of the type iii bursts and the dh type ii burst were closely associated with the propagating cme .    in the case of 20 january 2005",
    "we see several type - ii - burst lanes in the dynamic spectra at decimetric - metric and dh wavelengths , and it is possible that several shocks were formed during the intense event .",
    "the shock speeds derived from the decimetric observations ( 6501000 km s@xmath3 ) are not too far from the estimated initial cme speed , before acceleration ( as was shown in figure  [ fig4e ] ) .",
    "this study of cme propagation in three different halo cme events shows that speed estimation can be ambiguous .",
    "we list the following items that should be taken into account when determining the cme propagation characteristics :    * the plane - of - the - sky component of the speed is not simple to deproject , supposing a radial expansion from the source region , since it is biased by an expansion of the cme structure that is also approaching us .",
    "furthermore , the cme eruption may not necessarily be radial .",
    "in addition , thomson scattering is most efficient along the perpendicular to the line - of - sight , which will lead to asymmetric biases in expanding structures .",
    "these biases are greatest in the case of frontside halo cmes to which category all three events analysed here belong . due to the biases",
    ", the c2 cme height constraints we used to deduce velocities using different density models may not give reliable results .",
    "the biases described also affect ips measurements .",
    "the ips distances to the sun represent the orthogonal distances between the direction of the strongest disturbance and the sun , which are in planes gradually turning away from the plane of the sky .",
    "* simple geometric models for halo cmes , such as the cone model , can give reasonable values of radial velocity provided the model constraints , _",
    "e.g. _ constant velocity , are met . to solve for the two parameters ",
    "cone open angle and radial velocity  we need asymmetric halo cme expansion and images with good contrast , which reduces the number of cmes for which the cone model may be used . * by making the assumption that shocks are formed at the nose of a propagating cme ( piston - driven bow shock with super - alfvnic speed ) , we expect the heights of the radio shock and the heights of the white - light cme front to match .",
    "this might not always be the case , especially for shocks observed at decimetric - metric wavelengths .",
    "* the heights and speeds inferred from radio burst dynamic spectra need to be assessed critically , since they depend strongly on the selected electron density model .",
    "the selection of a density model includes the knowledge of certain atmospheric conditions , whether the propagation happens in equatorial quiet - sun densities , in dense coronal loops or streamer regions , in undisturbed medium , or in the wake of earlier transients . *",
    "while propagation through an undisturbed interplanetary environment can be traced relatively well , the task becomes more challenging when propagation involves interaction with slower cmes and passage through a medium that has been perturbed by several significant shocks in the preceding days .",
    "ip scintillation observations extend the range of cme observation to near earth orbit , and show in particular how the faster cmes are decelerated at distances @xmath256070 @xmath1 from the sun , by interaction with the solar wind plasma . * _ in - situ _ measurements at the l1 point can determine the arrival times of shocks and icme material and also allow estimates of the plasma speed .",
    "however , it is not always straightforward to relate particular shocks and plasma clouds detected near earth to the driving cmes that left the sun days earlier .",
