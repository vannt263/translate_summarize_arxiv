    "the casimir effect suggested originally in 1948 has been used to understand the contribution from the vacuum fluctuations of quantum fields@xcite .",

    "for the simplest one - dimensional model , the sum of excitations in the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional spacetime , where the boundaries are separated by the distance @xmath1 , is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the reduced planck constant .",
    "we define the averaged energy density by @xmath4 hereafter we set @xmath5 . in the limit of @xmath6 ,",
    "this gives for the massless field @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the continuous ( @xmath9 ) limit of @xmath10 .",

    "@xmath15 is assumed for @xmath16 .",
    "regularization using @xmath17-function is also possible .",
    "considering the regularization , the energy shift caused by the boundary is estimated as @xmath18    in the context of the hot big bang theory , the fundamental theory of unification predicts a sequence of phase transitions during the cosmological evolution of the universe .",
    "these phase transitions can be accompanied by the formation of domain structures that is determined by the symmetry breaking at the phase transition .",
    "wall domination , which always leads to a serious problem if the energy scale of the domain wall exceed 1mev , can be avoided if a small bias @xmath19 appears .",
    "the bias ( here we use this word specifically for the energy difference between the false and the true vacua ) becomes important when the force per unit area on the walls becomes comparable to the tension of the wall .",
    "then , the condition for the successful decay of the cosmological domain walls is satisfied when@xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the tension of the wall .",
    "the condition shows that the global discrete symmetry , which leads to the domain wall formation , must be broken explicitly . in that case",
    ", the magnitude of the ( explicit ) breaking parameter must explain the bias @xmath22 .",
    "this idea is useful in supersymmetric theory , in which the supergravity potential breaks discrete symmetry with the required magnitude@xcite .",
    "usually , the origin of the bias is considered for the explicit symmetry breaking in the potential .",
    "walls that are formed after brane inflation is realized by the deformation of the brane configuration in the compactified space@xcite .",
    "wall - like structure observed on a cosmic string may appear as a monopoles connected by the strings , which turns out to be a so - called cosmic necklace@xcite    in this paper , we consider a simple model in which the mass of an additional field @xmath23 is induced by the interaction @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the field that forms the wall configuration",
    ". it would be easy to find that an explicit symmetry breaking in the interaction causes a small mass difference in @xmath26 .",
    "the small mass difference between the adjacent vacua , which may be very small compared with the energy scale of the domain wall , may cause a bias when the vacuum fluctuations are considered .",
    "in addition to the conventional vacuum fluctuations , which may be the dominant contribution , the mass difference causes a boundary for the excitations of the @xmath23-field , which leads to another source of the bias .",
    "calculation of the vacuum fluctuations ( i.e. , the quantum bias caused by the casimir effect ) shows that the casimir force may have a significant impact on the evolution of the cosmological domain walls .",
    "although the casimir force for the massless field seems to be consistent with the experiments , it may have serious drawbacks when it is applied to the issue of the cosmological constant . since we are considering quantum bias between adjacent vacua , we can not be free from the peculiar assumptions that are needed to understand or explain the ( almost ) vanishing cosmological constant . in this paper",
    "we are making best effort to find a sensible result for the quantum bias , but it should be noted that our results are based on these assumptions , which will be further explained in sec.[sec3 ] .",
    "in the four dimensional model , it is possible to consider a double - well potential @xmath27 , which has a @xmath28 symmetry ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "this symmetry is broken spontaneously in either vacuum .",
    "interaction with a real scalar field @xmath23 can be given by @xmath30 , which gives a mass to the field @xmath23 .",
    "the domain walls are kinks of a real scalar field @xmath25 , which mediate between the two vacua @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "as we mentioned , we do not consider explicit breaking of the discrete symmetry in the potential @xmath33 .",
    "instead , we add a small but explicit symmetry breaking to the interaction , so that it leads to a small mass - gap for the @xmath23-field . obviously , there is no bias in the classical vacua .",
    "the source of the quantum bias can be explained by a small breaking of the @xmath28 symmetry in the interaction , which can be expressed as @xmath34 where @xmath35 measures the explicit symmetry breaking in the interaction . denoting the mass of @xmath23 in each domain by @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and placing the lower - mass domain in the area sandwiched by two domain walls , the @xmath23-field excitations that are discretized ( trapped ) by the boundary have @xmath38 .",
    "obviously , the excitations with @xmath39 can exist only in the domain sandwiched by the walls , while other ( higher ) excitations are continuous in both domains .. ]    ( 200,240)(100,0 )    let us first consider a simple model in one dimensional space ( @xmath40 ) , and place domain walls at @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the sum of the excitations discretized by the domain walls leads to the energy density @xmath43 where the integer @xmath44 is approximately given by @xmath45 .",
    "for the estimation of the casimir effect , we set @xmath46 hereafter . with regard to the wavelength of these excitations ,",
    "the effective length @xmath47 may depend on @xmath48 .",
    "the difference @xmath49 may be significant near @xmath44 , where the excitations penetrate into the higher - mass domains .",
    "however , for the simple estimation of the casimir effect , we choose the approximation @xmath50 in this paper .    despite the simplicity of the scenario , regularization of the vacuum fluctuations",
    "requires non - trivial assumptions that are far from obvious . in order to compare our result with the usual casimir effect , it would be useful to start with a massless field .",
    "therefore , we first consider a model with @xmath51 and @xmath52 , so that we can calculate the casimir energy using the conventional assumptions .",
    "the casimir energy density in the constrained massless domain , which is sandwiched by the walls at @xmath41 and @xmath42 , is given by @xmath53 where the cancellation occurs in the continuous part @xmath54 .",
    "here we set @xmath55 and @xmath56 . executing the finite sum",
    ", it leads to @xmath57 where @xmath58 is required to obtain a non - trivial result .    in the above calculation ,",
    "the origin of the casimir energy is the discretization of the excitations , which is obviously finite .",
    "we subtracted the `` common '' part , which is continuous and divergent . in doing this",
    ", we assumed that the discretization of the excitations does not affect the regularization of the continuous part above @xmath54 .    in the above calculation , we defined the casimir energy in the massless domain by @xmath59@xcite .",
    "however , the bias between the adjacent vacua may `` not '' be measured by the casimir effect in the massless domain . namely , there is the possibility that @xmath60 may become the dominant part of the bias . in such calculation",
    "we have to reconsider regularization in the massive domain .    to understand the problem , consider two domains denoted by `` a '' and `` b '' , which are separated by a wall . then the vacuum fluctuations are ( naively ) given by @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively . without additional principle for the regularization",
    ", @xmath63 leads to @xmath64 .",
    "if the above calculation is true , the total vacuum fluctuations may depend explicitly on the particle content of the vacuum .",
    "the simplest way to avoid this problem is to assume some ( unknown ) regularization scheme that explains vanishing vacuum fluctuations in the @xmath65 limit , which works for each field .",
    "if this assumption is true , one always find @xmath66 for the entire field labeled by @xmath67 .",
    "instead , one may consider a delicate cancellation between fields with different masses and spins , which eventually leads to the effective cosmological constant @xmath68 , where @xmath69 denotes contributions from other effects . obviously , in the latter case the delicate cancellation is crucial for the bias calculation .",
    "namely , if the delicate cancellation is violated in a false - vacuum domain , where the mass distribution is different from the true vacuum , the quantum bias is more significant compared with the casimir energy calculated above .    in the next section ,",
    "we consider a realistic four - dimensional model of cosmological domain walls and examine the cosmological domain wall problem with the use of the quantum bias , which is caused by the symmetry breaking in the interaction .",
    "we first consider a massless domain sandwiched by massive domains . for this thought experiment , specific form of the potential can be expressed by @xmath70 ( in this case there is no @xmath28 symmetry but the degeneracy of the classical vacua still remains ) , or alternatively a fine - tuning can be considered in the interaction term ( i.e. , @xmath71 makes @xmath51 ) . in order to realize a small mass - gap compared with the domain - wall tension ( @xmath72 ) , we consider @xmath73 .",
    "consider the domain sandwiched by two infinite and flat walls in the free @xmath0 space .",

    "@xmath86 denotes the mass of the field @xmath23 in the massive domain .    in the above calculation",
    ", we considered a massless domain sandwiched by massive domains with a mass - gap @xmath87 at the boundary ( domain wall ) .",
    "unlike the conventional casimir effect , however , the discretization occurs only for a finite number of the excitations .",
    "the above calculation for the `` massless '' domain is straight and very instructive , but here we must remember that the most important situation in our model is that the `` massive '' field feels a small mass - gap at a domain wall . in that case , the casimir energy may cause the energy difference that depends on the mass distribution , as we already mentioned in the previous section for the domain walls .",
    "the situation seems unfavorable for the cosmological constant problem .",
    "since the root of the cosmological constant problem is not obvious yet , and this is not the topic i am discussing in this paper , we follow the conventional calculation and try to find sensible consequences that may have phenomenological interest . for instance , let us consider a bias @xmath88 for the cosmological domain walls with the tension @xmath89 .",
    "if the ( almost ) vanishing cosmological constant is explained by the delicate cancellation ( @xmath68 ) , the bias between the domains with @xmath90 and @xmath91 is calculated as @xmath92 for the interaction that leads to @xmath93 , the required condition for the safe decay is @xmath94 which is about @xmath95 times smaller than @xmath96 .",
    "is very small , the condition is conceivable for @xmath97tev @xmath98 domain walls . ] in this case , we may conclude that a small mass - gap that is caused by the symmetry breaking in the interaction term can be used to solve the cosmological domain walls problem .",
    "we find , therefore , a very useful solution to the cosmological domain - wall problem when the cosmological constant is tuned by the delicate cancellation .",
    "if one can not agree with such cancellation , an alternative assumption would be that the casimir energy vanishes for each massive field in the infinite - volume limit ( i.e. , @xmath66 for any @xmath67 ) .",
    "our purpose in this paper is not to argue which assumption is plausible , but to address the consequences that result from these assumptions . if the result obtained from our calculation turns out to be false in some experiment , one needs to introduce an additional principle for the regularization , so that one can calculate correctly the casimir effect caused by the mass - gap . in any case",
    ", we believe that studying cosmological domain walls in terms of the casimir effect can make a difference to the usual approaches to these problems .",
    "note however that , as far as the `` casimir energy '' is defined using @xmath59 , it is always possible to calculate the casimir energy in an automatic manner .",
    "therefore , in this paragraph , we are not going to argue the authenticity of the casimir effect for a massive field , which may need improvement if it is responsible for the cosmological constant , but to calculate the casimir effect in the automatic way .",
    "consider two domains in which the masses of the field @xmath23 are given by @xmath99 in the high - mass domain and @xmath100 in the low - mass domain .",

    "this term does not cause any bias in the classical vacua , but may source the quantum bias .",
    "then the two vacua at @xmath124 , which are classically degenerate , can be split by the casimir effect . in the first example ,",
    "in which we compared the vacuum fluctuations in different domains assuming that the vanishing cosmological constant is explained by the delicate cancellation , we find that domain walls can decay safe due to the quantum bias . in the second example , in which we considered the effect of the boundaries that are formed by the domain walls",
