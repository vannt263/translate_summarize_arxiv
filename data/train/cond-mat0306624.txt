    "the discovery of bose - einstein condenstates ( bec ) in atomic vapors of alkali metals has opened new possibilities to observe matter waves of soliton type .",
    "these excitations were first discovered in bec with repulsive interatomic interactions , in the form of dark solitons @xcite , and more recently , in bec with attractive interatomic interactions , in the form of bright solitons moving on zero backgrounds @xcite . since soliton",
    "matter waves are of primary importance for developing concrete applications , it is of interest to devise methods which allow to control them .",
    "one possibility is to vary the atomic scattering length by means of external magnetic fields , i.e. by using feshbach resonances . in ref.@xcite",
    ", it was shown that an abrupt change in time of the atomic scattering length , can lead to the splitting of the soliton with the generation of new solitons .",
    "the fragmentation of the wave obviously decreases the number of atoms contained in the original pulse , this being undesirable for applications such as atom lasers .    in the present paper",
    "we suggest to use _",
    "adiabatic _ variations of the atomic scattering length , both in time and in space , as an effective way for controlling soliton s parameters and to induce changes in their shape which could be useful for applications .",
    "in contrast to abrupt variations , adiabatic changes make possible to preserve the integrity of the soliton ( no splitting occurs ) , this leading for bright solitons to the compression of the pulse with the increase of the matter density , and for dark solitons to the compression of the hole with a decrease of the background level ( matter from background move inside the hole ) . these phenomena are shown to exist both in presence and in absence of a parabolic confining potential . in the last case",
    "we derive analytical equations for soliton parameters in terms of adiabatic invariants and soliton perturbation theory .",
    "the results of this analysis is found in good agreement with direct integration of the 1d gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) .",
    "the effect of a confining parabolic potential on the adiabatic dynamics of the soliton is also investigated by numerical simulations .",
    "we find that , for bright solitons , except for the oscillatory motion around the bottom of the trap , the phenomena of pulse compression is practically the same as in absence of the trap ( this is particularly true for solitons initially at rest in the bottom of the trap ) . for dark soliton",
    "the phenomenon is only qualitatively preserved , due to the boundaries effects introduced by the trap .",
    "the possibility to compress bec solitons could be an experimental tool to investigate the range of validity of the 1d gpe .",
    "since the quasi one dimensional regime is valid for low densities , it would be indeed interesting to see how far one can compress a soliton in a real experiment by means of adiabatic changes of the scattering length .",
    "effects of adiabatic perturbations on soliton dynamics were also investigated in the context of josephson junctions @xcite and in nonlinear optics @xcite .",
    "in contrast with josephson junctions and optical fibers , which require structural changes or preparation of new samples , the study of adiabatic nonlinear perturbations on bec solitons appears more natural and easy to perform , since the strength of the nonlinear interaction can be changed by using only external fields .",
    "we also remark that soliton dynamics in a quasi one - dimensional bec under time - dependent _ linear _ potential was recently studied in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 1",
    "we perform an analytical study of the effects on bright and dark bec solitons induced by spatial and temporal adiabatic variations of the scattering length . for temporal variations we use both a variational approach and perturbation theory to obtain equations for soliton s parameters both in presence and absence of a confining parabolic potential . in the former case",
    "the problem can be linked to an adiabatic invariant of the kepler problem with results depending only on adiabaticity ( smoothness ) but not on the smallness of the perturbation . for spatial variations",
    "we use standard soliton s perturbation theory . in section 2",
    "we compare the results of this analysis with direct numerical integrations of the full 1d gpe both in absence and in presence of an harmonic trap . in the last section",
    "we summarize the main results of the paper .",

    "adiabatic variation of the atomic scattering in 1d ( cigar shaped ) bec we consider the following normalized gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the ground state wavefunction of the condensate , @xmath8 is a slowly varying function of space and time , @xmath9 corresponds to the case of negative and positive scattering length @xmath3 ( @xmath10 denotes the longitudinal frequency of the trap ) . in eq .",

    "panels ( c ) and ( d ) of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , show the time evolution of a dark soliton in absence and in presence of a parabolic trap .",
    "we remark that , while in the bright case the compression of the soliton is obviously accompanied by an increase of its amplitude , in the dark case the amplitude can not decrease below zero , so that the compression must be combined with a decrease of the background level ( the matter from the background move inside the hole so to reduce its size ) .",
    "this is particularly evident in panel c for the case @xmath34 .",
    "we remark that this case , although physically non realisable for bec , it is of interest for nonlinear optics , and shows the role played by the confinement potential in the case of bec with positive scattering lengths ( it should be compared with panel(d ) discussed below ) .    in analogy with bright solitons",
    ", one could expect that an abrupt change in time of the scattering length may split a dark soliton ground state into dark and grey sub - components if the amplitude of the perturbation is big enough .",
    "this is indeed what we numerically observed .",

    "the influence of the parabolic trap on a dark soliton initially at the rest in its bottom , is reported in panel ( d ) of fig .",
    "although the phenomenon resemble the one observed in absence of the trap ( notice the decrease of the background after the transition ) , the solution is more complicated due to the boundary effects introduced by the trap . in particular",
    "we see that the compression of the hole in the center is less effective than for @xmath34 , and the decrease of the background is accompanied by an expansion of the condensate .",
    "this is a consequence of the non constancy of the background ( it obviously must go to zero at large distances ) which permits the matter to escape up in the trap ( the pressure on the hole is thus partially lost in the expansion ) .",
    "the same phenomenon exists also for dark solitons initially oscillating in the trap .",

    "notice that this crossover value of @xmath82 corresponds to a variation function @xmath89 which is already quite rapid ( see top inset of the figure ) .",

    "very little oscillations of the soliton profile are found in these cases . on the contrary , the non - adiabatic ( or fast oscillation ) region is characterized by the presence of large oscillations of the soliton profile , induced by the rapid variation of the scattering length .",

    "[ fig4 ] , in which we depicted , besides the initial profile at @xmath96 , two snapshots of the soliton ( max and min of the profile ) to evidenciate its oscillations at the final time @xmath119 .",

    "[ fig3 ] ( the splitting , however , depends also on the amplitude of the scattering length variation , and usually occurs much above the interface between adiabatic and fast oscillation behavior ) . from this analysis",
    "we conclude that the adiabatic compression of matter wave solitons is possible in a wide range of the parameter @xmath82 ( i.e. @xmath120 ) and is compatible with relatively fast variations of the scattering length , as one can see from the top inset of fig .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that adiabatic changes of the scattering length , both in space and time , can be effectively used to control parameters of bec matter waves of soliton type .",
    "in particular we showed the effect of pulse compression both on dark and bright solitons in presence and absence of a confining parabolic potential .",
    "the influence of the smoothness of the transition was also considered .",
    "we found that deviations from adiabatic predictions occur only for very large values of @xmath82 , i.e. for almost step - like variations .",
    "this implies that the results of this paper are valid for generic smooth variations of the scattering length and therefore are expected to be found in real bec matter waves experiments .",
    "the possibility of sharpening bright and dark solitons by means of smooth variations of the scattering length , beside providing another confirmation of the soliton nature of the bec ground state , may be very useful for concrete applications .",
