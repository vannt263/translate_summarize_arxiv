    "the old proposal for additional spatial dimension(s ) @xcite and the more recent idea of brane universe models @xcite-@xcite have received considerable attention in the late nineties as novel frameworks for addressing a long standing puzzle : the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "indeed , several new approaches toward the gauge hierarchy question , based on the existence of extra dimension(s ) , have been suggested in the literature @xcite-@xcite .",
    "+ the first approach @xcite , which was proposed by arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali ( add ) , is the following one .",
    "if spacetime is the product of a 4-dimensional minkowski spacetime with a n - dimensional compact space , and standard model ( sm ) fields are confined to the 4-dimensional subspace whereas gravity propagates also in the extra compact space , then one has , @xmath0 @xmath1 being the fundamental ( 4+n)-dimensional mass scale of gravity , @xmath2 ( @xmath3 newton constant ) the effective 4-dimensional ( reduced ) planck scale and @xmath4 the volume of compact space .",
    "hence , by taking a sufficiently large size of new n dimensions , the value of fundamental scale @xmath1 can be of order of the tev , which removes the important hierarchy between the gravitational and electroweak energy scales .",
    "nevertheless , another hierarchy is then introduced : the discrepancy between the electroweak symmetry breaking scale ( @xmath5 ) and the compactification scale ( @xmath6 ) .    an elegant alternative solution to the gauge hierarchy problem",
    "was proposed by randall and sundrum ( rs ) @xcite .",
    "the rs scenario consists of a 5-dimensional theory in which the extra dimension ( parameterized by @xmath7 ) is compactified on a @xmath8 orbifold of radius @xmath9 ( so that @xmath10 ) .",
    "gravity propagates in the bulk and the fifth dimension is bordered by two 3-branes with tensions tuned such that , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the bulk cosmological constant , @xmath13 the fundamental 5-dimensional planck scale and @xmath14 the anti - de - sitter ( @xmath15 ) curvature radius ( see below ) . within this context",
    ", the zero mode of graviton is localized on the positive tension brane , namely the 3-brane at @xmath16 .",
    "hence , while on this brane ( referred to as the planck - brane ) the 4-dimensional planck mass is of order @xmath17 , on the other brane ( at @xmath18 ) the effective planck scale , @xmath19 is affected by the exponential `` warp '' factor @xmath20 . from eq.([rsratio ] ) , we see that for a small extra dimension such that @xmath21 ( @xmath22 is typically of order @xmath23 ) , one has @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( the 3-brane at @xmath18 is then called the tev - brane ) .",
    "if the sm particles ( in particular the higgs boson ) are confined to the tev - brane , they feel an effective planck scale @xmath26 of the same order of magnitude as the electroweak scale . in this sense",
    ", the rs model provides a new natural solution to the gauge hierarchy problem . + besides , in the rs framework , no additional strong hierarchy between fundamental scales appears ( in contrast with the add approach ) as the compactification scale @xmath27 is of order @xmath28 .",
    "however , in the rs scenario , we live on a brane with negative tension ( see eq.([rstensions ] ) ) which seems generically problematic as far as gravity and cosmology are concerned ( see @xcite , @xcite-@xcite for a complete discussion ) .",
    "in particular , as it is clear from the corrected friedmann equation for the hubble expansion rate of our brane world , on our negative tension brane the energy density of normal matter / radiation should be negative , which conflicts with the absence of any noticeable effects of anti - gravity in our universe .    in order to avoid this potential cosmological problem ,",
    "some multi - brane extensions of the rs model ( still addressing the gauge hierarchy problem ) , in which the sm fields are stuck on a positive tension brane , have been constructed @xcite-@xcite . in the rs model extension of @xcite ,",
    "two positive tension branes are sitting on the fixed points of the @xmath8 orbifold , namely at @xmath16 and @xmath29 , and a third parallel 3-brane with negative tension can move freely in between . within this @xmath30 scenario ,",
    "our universe is the @xmath31 brane at @xmath29 ( the two brane rs model is denoted as @xmath32 accordingly to this terminology ) . in another possible rs extension : the @xmath33 model @xcite , a @xmath31 brane is located at @xmath16 , a @xmath34 brane at @xmath29 and we live on an intermediate parallel @xmath31 brane . in the @xmath35 model @xcite , two @xmath31 branes are sitting on the two orbifold fixed points and we live on one of them .",
    "+ it must be first mentioned that the original motivation for the multi - brane rs extensions ( which is to provide a solution to the cosmological problem , arising in the rs model , related to the modification of friedmann equations ) is not as strong as it seems . indeed , in the presence of a mechanism stabilizing the size of the extra dimension within the rs model ( like the mechanisms suggested in @xcite or @xcite ) , the ordinary frw ( friedmann - robertson - walker ) equations are recovered @xcite .",
    "however , the multi - brane rs extensions remain interesting alternatives to the initial version of rs model since they give rise to a specific phenomenology . as a matter of fact",
    ", the multi - brane rs extensions possess a specific feature : the first kk excitations of a bulk fermion ( or the graviton ) are typically anomalously light ( relatively to the electroweak scale ) @xcite .",
    "the reason being that the magnitude of wave functions for first fermion kk modes typically approximates closely that for the 0-mode , differing significantly only in a region where the 0-mode wave function is exponentially suppressed . + several other models , which extend the original rs framework , have also been elaborated in the literature , including the possibilities of configurations with several branes @xcite , intersecting branes @xcite or non - compact extra dimension(s ) @xcite ( as for instance in the case of an infinite crystalline universe @xcite ) .",
    "those theoretical models lead generally to a rather complicated phenomenology .",
    "nevertheless , within all these attractive scenarios , namely add , rs and its multi - brane extensions , understanding lightness of neutrinos ( with respect to the electroweak energy scale ) becomes a challenge .",
    "indeed , in this new class of brane universe models , the ( effective ) mass scale of gravity is of order of the tev so that there exist no high energy scales .",
    "hence , this brane world picture conflicts with the traditional interpretation of small neutrino mass size invoking the ` see - saw ' mechanism @xcite-@xcite , which requires a superheavy mass scale close to the gut scale ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "+ in the context of the add scenario , a novel type of explanation for the smallness of neutrino masses has been proposed in terms of purely geometrical means @xcite ( the associated neutrino phenomenology has been extensively studied in @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "we remind here briefly the basic ideas of this kind of explanation , which does not rely on the existence of any high energy scale .",
    "the starting point is the observation that a right - handed neutrino added to the sm would be a gauge singlet , and could thus propagate freely inside the bulk .",
    "in such a situation , small dirac neutrino masses can be naturally generated as the yukawa couplings , between the higgs boson , sm left - handed neutrinos and zero mode of bulk right - handed neutrinos , are suppressed , due to the weak interaction probability of bulk neutrinos with sm fields ( which are confined to our 4-dimensional subspace ) .",
    "this suppression is considerable since , in the add framework , the volume of extra compact space is large relatively to the thickness of the wall where sm states propagate .",
    "more precisely , the effective 4-dimensional mass term , between sm neutrinos and zero mode of bulk neutrinos , involves a suppression factor of the form ( see eq.([add ] ) ) : @xmath37 where @xmath38 represents the dimensionless yukawa coupling constants and @xmath39 the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the sm higgs boson .",
    "the physical neutrino masses are the eigenvalues of the whole neutrino mass matrix , which involves the masses of type ( [ mnuvolfac ] ) , but also the masses of the kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations of bulk right - handed neutrinos , as well as the masses mixing those kk modes with the sm left - handed neutrinos ( which originate from the yukawa couplings ) .    the same kind of intrinsically higher - dimensional mechanism as above ( with an additional right - handed neutrino in the bulk ) , producing small neutrino masses , can apply to the rs model case",
    "nevertheless , within the rs scenario , the compactification volume is small ( @xmath40 ) and the @xmath15 geometry tends to localize the 0-mode of bulk neutrino around the brane where are stuck sm particles ( tev - brane ) . ) ) .",
    "[ test ] ] hence , in order to obtain the desired order of magnitude for the effective neutrino mass scale , via this higher - dimensional mechanism , one has to introduce a 5-dimensional mass term for the bulk right - handed neutrino @xcite ( see also @xcite for the specific case of a 7-dimensional spacetime including one warped extra dimension ) . indeed , such a mass term of the appropriate form can modify the wave function for the 0-mode of bulk neutrino ( applying the ideas of @xcite ) so that its overlap with the tev - brane , and thus its effective 4-dimensional yukawa coupling with the higgs boson and sm left - handed neutrino , appears to be greatly reduced .",
    "+ we mention here an alternative possibility , although it corresponds to a different physical context from the one considered in the present paper : in the rs model , all sm fields ( except the higgs boson , otherwise the gauge hierarchy problem would reappear @xcite ) could live inside the bulk @xcite , if the sm gauge group is enhanced ( in order to satisfy the electroweak precision constraints @xcite ) .",
    "this realistic hypothesis provides a new way for interpreting the flavor structure of sm fermion masses @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we address the question which arises naturally from the above discussion : does the same type of geometrical mechanism as above ( with a 5-dimensional mass term for the bulk right - handed neutrino ) can create reasonable neutrino mass values in multi - brane extensions of the rs scenario ?",
    "+ one expects that indeed sufficiently reduced neutrino masses can again be achieved through this mechanism . however , within the multi - brane rs extensions , the first kk excitations of right - handed neutrino can acquire ultralight masses compared to the electroweak scale ( see above ) . by consequence",
    ", some mixing ( induced by the yukawa couplings ) angles between the sm left - handed neutrinos and kk excitations of right - handed neutrinos should be typically large .",
    "now , one can obtain severe experimental upper bounds on values of this kind of mixing angle between sm neutrinos and kk modes of right - handed neutrinos , since those kk states constitute new sterile neutrinos with respect to gauge interactions .",
    "in particular , these mixing angles can be strongly constrained by considering the experimental data on @xmath41 boson widths associated to certain decay channels .",
    "+ therefore , we will derive these constraints on mixing angles ( arising due to the presence of bulk right - handed neutrinos ) which are issued from the measurements of @xmath41 boson widths , within the context of multi - brane generalizations of the rs model .",
    "then , we will determine whether those constraints translate into bounds , on the theoretical parameters , which exclude or not multi - brane extensions of the rs model from the possible frameworks addressing simultaneously the gauge hierarchy and small neutrino mass questions ( the other experimental constraints on neutrino mass matrix will also be considered ) .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ and ] , we describe in details the entire neutrino mass matrix , within the @xmath30 framework , in case additional right - handed neutrinos propagate in the bulk .",
    "then , in section [ main ] , by considering this neutrino mass matrix , we derive and discuss constraints on the @xmath30 scenario coming from experimental bounds which concern neutrino physics .",
    "based on our understanding of the @xmath30 analysis performed in those two sections , we discuss in section [ + + and++- ] the cases of the other multi - brane rs extensions : the @xmath35 and @xmath33 models .",
    "finally , we conclude in section [ conclu ] .",
    "the goal of this work is a phenomenological study on the new paradigm of anomalously light kk excitations which is associated to the multi - brane rs extensions .",
    "we will begin by concentrating on a certain concrete realization , namely the @xmath30 model , of this new paradigm because of the relative simplicity of calculations within the @xmath30 context .",
    "+ we mention here that the @xmath30 model can be seen as a limiting case of the more general @xmath42 brane universe scenario ( with a flat space between the two @xmath34 branes ) @xcite .",
    "the @xmath30 model suffers from the presence of unacceptable radion fields , associated with the perturbations of the freely moving @xmath34 brane sandwiched between @xmath31 branes , which are necessarily ghost states with negative kinetic term @xcite .",
    "this fact is indeed problematic regarding the construction because the system is probably quantum mechanically unstable .",
    "classically , the origin of the problem is connected to the violation of the weaker energy condition @xcite .",
    "however , we will consider the @xmath30 model as a ` toy model ' and a calculation tool allowing us then to develop a better understanding of the phenomenological analyzes on the other multi - brane rs extensions , namely the @xmath35 and @xmath33 models ( which will be treated later : see section [ + + and++- ] ) .",
    "now , those @xmath35 and @xmath33 models represent concrete realizations of the mentioned new paradigm which do not suffer from the presence of radion ghost states .",
    "moreover , a 6-dimensional version , totally consistent from the theoretical point of view , of the @xmath30 model has been elaborated @xcite . within this 6-dimensional framework , due to the non - trivial internal space",
    ", the characteristic bounce of warp factor can appear even without the presence of any ( moving ) @xmath34 brane .",
    "hence , one can avoid here the problematic presence of radion ghost states .",
    "+ now , in this 6-dimensional setup , the @xmath31 3-branes of the @xmath30 model are replaced by 4-branes , but one of their dimensions is compact , unwarped and of planck length .",
    "thus , in the low energy limit the spacetime on the branes appears 3-dimensional .",
    "the 6-dimensional @xmath30 version has similar predictions and almost identical properties as the considered 5-dimensional `` + -+ '' version , so that one can extend the present phenomenological study to the case of a 6-dimensional spacetime .",
    "besides , there exist a potential way out of the radion ghost problem arising in the @xmath30 model : the @xmath34 brane can be replaced by an external constant 4-form field which would mimic the effects of such a brane @xcite .",
    "+ one can also assume that there exist a specific framework in which the radion ghost fields , appearing in the @xmath30 model , condensate ( so that the background can be stabilized ) @xcite or that the theory containing ghosts may in fact be viable due to other kinds of particular circumstances @xcite .",
    "an alternative solution would be that there exist a certain regularization procedure ( like the one proposed in the recent works @xcite ) which applies to the @xmath30 model , resulting in a theory free from ghosts or tachyons .      in view of a comparison with the @xmath30 scenario",
    ", we remind that within the rs model , the considered solution to the 5-dimensional einstein s equations , respecting 4-dimensional poincar invariance , leads to the non - factorisable metric : @xmath43 with @xmath44 , @xmath45 $ ] the coordinates for the familiar 4 dimensions and @xmath46 the 4-dimensional metric . the bulk geometry , associated to the metric ( [ rsmetric ] ) ,",

    "the mass @xmath71 could be the vev of a scalar field .",

    "we check that the vev ( [ vev ] ) is well compatible with the @xmath78 symmetry ( @xmath79 ) of the @xmath8 orbifold : this vev is odd under the @xmath78 transformation ( see eq.([warpfunction ] ) ) , like the product @xmath80 ( as fermion parity is defined by : @xmath81 ) , so that the term @xmath82 is even which allows to preserve the invariance of action ( [ action ] ) .",
    "+ at this stage , what do we know about the value of parameter @xmath77 ? since the mass @xmath71 is a parameter that appears in the original 5-dimensional action ( [ action ] ) , its natural absolute value is of order of the fundamental 5-dimensional planck scale @xmath13 . besides , @xmath83 ( see eq.([warpfunction ] ) ) and @xmath84 ( see eq.([trust ] ) ) .",
    "hence , it is clear from eq.([vev ] ) that the ` physical ' value of @xmath77 verifies : @xmath85 ( as discussed in @xcite ) . + by consequence , the relevant case is the one characterized by @xmath86 , in which the 0-mode of bulk neutrino is localized on the two positive tension branes ( at @xmath16 and @xmath87 ) @xcite like the 0-mode of graviton ( as mentioned in foot - note [ test ] ) .",
    "therefore , the effective 4-dimensional mass @xmath88 , induced by the yukawa coupling of action ( [ action ] ) and mixing the 0-mode of bulk right - handed neutrino @xmath89 with the sm left - handed neutrino @xmath90 ( stuck on the @xmath31 brane at @xmath87 ) , is reduced for the same geometrical reason that the effective scale of gravity @xmath26 ( on the brane sitting at @xmath87 ) is suppressed .",

    "similarly , the yukawa coupling of action ( [ action ] ) also induces the following effective 4-dimensional masses mixing @xmath90 with the first kk excitation of neutrino @xmath93 @xcite : @xmath94 or with the other kk excitations @xmath95 [ @xmath96 @xcite : @xmath97 . \\label{mnun}\\ ] ] the @xmath61 dependence in eq.([mnun ] ) can be understood as follows : the kk states @xmath95 [ @xmath96 are localized around the @xmath34 brane at @xmath48 ( in contrast with the first kk mode @xmath93 which is localized on the two positive tension branes ) so that when @xmath61 increases their wave function overlap with @xmath90 ( trapped on the @xmath31 brane at @xmath87 ) , and thus the associated mass @xmath98 , decreases .    finally , the excited modes of bulk neutrino @xmath99 [ @xmath100 acquire kk masses of the form ( for @xmath86 ) @xcite : @xmath101 @xmath102 , \\label{mkkn}\\ ] ] where @xmath103 is the @xmath104-th root of @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) and @xmath107 is the @xmath108-th root of @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) , @xmath111 denoting the bessel functions of the first kind and order @xmath112 .",

    ".5 cm    @xmath185 * characteristic examples : * now , we will give examples of values , within the case of 3 lepton flavors , for the bound on parameter @xmath61 deduced from the constraints due to @xmath41 width measurements and experimental limits on absolute neutrino masses . those typical examples will confirm the expectation ( see above ) that this bound on @xmath61 has the same order of magnitude in the two cases of 1 and 3 flavors .",
    "let us start by considering the simplified scenario where the 3 parameters @xmath233 [ @xmath232 are related , for instance , through the formula , @xmath247 which reduces the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the hypothesis ( [ ex3fia ] ) is motivated by the fact that values , for the 3 fundamental parameters @xmath233 , of similar orders of magnitude are desirable . under this assumption ( [ ex3fia ] ) , requiring that the 3 smallest eigenvalues @xmath159 of neutrino mass matrix ( [ massmatrix ] ) ( modified to involve the 3 @xmath233 parameters ) are smaller than the ev scale ( see section [ neutmass ] ) yields the numerical result : @xmath248 @xmath249 which is close to the same result obtained in the case of 1 neutrino generation for similar values of @xmath63 ( see eq.([climb ] ) with following text ) .",
    "then , by taking into account this bound ( [ ex3fib])-([ex3fibbis ] ) on @xmath250 ( together with eq.([ex3fia ] ) ) and applying the constraint ( [ thetabound ] ) ( from @xmath41 width measurements ) on the @xmath141 expression ( [ thetab3f ] ) in terms of all the fundamental parameters , we find ( with @xmath251 accordingly to characteristic relation ( [ m5exp ] ) ) , @xmath252    the other example of simplification hypothesis we consider , namely , @xmath253 corresponds to values of the 3 @xmath233 parameters more distinct than in the first hypothesis ( [ ex3fia ] ) . under the assumption ( [ ex3fiia ] ) , the constraints from @xmath41 width measurements ( namely the constraint ( [ thetabound ] ) on @xmath141 ) and from limits on neutrino mass scales ( given in section [ neutmass ] ) lead to the same bound on @xmath250 as in eq.([ex3fib])-([ex3fibbis ] ) and then , by using expression ( [ thetab3f ] ) , to ( with @xmath251 ) : @xmath254    in conclusion , the characteristic values ( [ ex3fic ] ) and ( [ ex3fiib ] ) for the bound on parameter @xmath61 ( issued from experimental considerations on neutrino physics ) , which were derived in the case of 3 neutrino flavors , are of same order as the values for the identical bound obtained in the case of 1 neutrino flavor ( see eq.([finalnum ] ) ) .",

    "+ in the more precise case of 3 lepton flavors , one could also use the bounds on squared neutrino mass differences ( @xmath255 and @xmath256 ) and lepton mixing angles ( @xmath257 , @xmath258 and @xmath259 ) , which are derived from the present results of neutrino flavor oscillation experiments @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these lepton mixing angles depend on the neutrino mass matrix , which is predicted by the considered @xmath30 scenario ( with additional massive bulk neutrinos ) , but also on the charged lepton mass matrix , which in contrast is not determined by our scenario . therefore , in order to use the bounds on these lepton mixing angles for constraining the @xmath30 model , one should consider a complementary model dictating the flavor structure of charged lepton masses , which is beyond the scope of our study . +",
    "we also mention that , in a detailed approach based on 3 lepton species , one could also envisage to use the astrophysical and cosmological constraints ( like those due to considerations on big bang nucleosynthesis and duration of the supernova 1987a neutrino burst @xcite ) on mixing angles between a sterile neutrino and an active sm neutrino ( either @xmath260 , @xmath261 or @xmath262 ) , as well as the sno ( salt phase ) data @xcite on fraction of sterile neutrino component in the resultant solar @xmath260 flux at earth , and , the experimental bound on branching ratio of the flavor violating decay channel @xmath263 ( which is enhanced by the presence of significantly massive sterile neutrinos @xcite ) . as a matter of fact , remind that , within the considered @xmath30 scenario , the kk excitations of bulk neutrinos ( denoted as @xmath241 [ @xmath264 ) behave like sterile neutrinos .",
    "here , we discuss , within the same philosophy as above , the case of another realization of the paradigm of anomalously light kk excitations : the @xmath35 model .",
    "+ the absence of any @xmath34 brane in the @xmath35 model protects it against the problem of radion ghost fields .",
    "nevertheless , it turns out that for the construction of such a @xmath35 configuration , it is essential to have @xmath265 geometry on both branes @xcite .    in the @xmath35 model ,",
    "the warp function @xmath266 ( which determines the metric as shown in eq.([rsmetric ] ) context , with our definition ( [ rsmetric ] ) of the metric , the warp function @xmath266 must also depend on the familiar coordinates @xmath267 [ @xmath268 @xcite . ] ) can reach a minimum at a point @xmath269 lying between the two @xmath31 branes which sit on the two orbifold fixed points at @xmath16 and @xmath87 ( where we live ) @xcite .",
    "this geometrical feature is also a fundamental characteristic of the @xmath30 model in which the warp function @xmath266 reaches also a minimum at a point @xmath48 ( see eq.([warpfunction ] ) ) lying between two @xmath31 branes at @xmath16 and @xmath87 ( here , there exist a @xmath34 brane at the extremum @xmath48 ) . in this sense ,",
    "the geometrical configuration of the @xmath35 model mimics that of the @xmath30 model . +",
    "this similarity has two main consequences .",
    "first , the localizations of bulk neutrino kk modes , and thus the masses ( given by eq.([mnu0])-([mnun ] ) in the @xmath30 model ) mixing those kk modes with sm neutrinos ( trapped at @xmath87 ) , should be comparable in the @xmath35 and @xmath30 models .",
    "secondly , the kk masses ( given in eq.([mkk1])-([mkkn ] ) for @xmath30 and in @xcite for @xmath35 ) for excitations of bulk neutrinos are similar ( with identical dependences on theoretical parameters ) in the @xmath35 and @xmath30 models .",
    "+ therefore , the whole effective neutrino mass matrix ( which involves only these masses ( [ mnu0])-([mnun ] ) and ( [ mkk1])-([mkkn ] ) , as shows eq.([massmatrix ] ) , within the @xmath30 model ) is expected to behave similarly in the equivalent parameter spaces of the @xmath35 and @xmath30 scenarios .",
    "hence , in the @xmath35 scenario ( for @xmath270 ) , one expects to deduce , from experimental constraints on neutrinos , limits on the equivalent parameter @xmath271 of the same order as the limits on @xmath61 that we have obtained within the @xmath30 framework , namely : @xmath272      let us finally study the third multi - brane rs extension , namely the consistent @xmath33 model .",

    "hence , this model does not contain any freely moving @xmath34 brane and thus does not give rise to the existence of radion ghost fields @xcite .",
    "we begin by describing the neutrino mass matrix in the @xmath33 framework .",

    "<S> scenarios based on the existence of large or warped ( randall - sundrum model ) extra dimensions have been proposed for addressing the long standing puzzle of gauge hierarchy problem . within the contexts of both those scenarios , a novel and original type of mechanism generating small ( dirac ) neutrino masses , which relies on the presence of additional right - handed neutrinos that propagate in the bulk , has arisen . </S>",
    "<S> the main objective of the present study is to determine whether this geometrical mechanism can produce reasonable neutrino masses also in the interesting multi - brane extensions of the randall - sundrum model . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that , in some multi - brane extensions , neutrino masses in agreement with all relevant experimental bounds can indeed be generated but at the price of a constraint ( stronger than the existing ones ) on the bulk geometry , and that the other multi - brane models even conflict with those experimental bounds .    </S>",
