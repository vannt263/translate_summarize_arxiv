    "in recent years several frustrated quasi one dimensional magnetic compounds have been identified and studied experimentally @xcite . in the one - dimensional phase ,",
    "i.e. for temperatures above the magnetic ordering transition , frustration is expected to lead to incommensurate correlations .",
    "precisely how frustration gives rise to incommensurabilitites for the extreme `` quantum '' case of spin @xmath1 is at present not well understood .",
    "a paradigm of a frustrated quantum magnet is the spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain with nearest neighbour exchange @xmath2 and next - nearest neighbour exchange @xmath3 .",
    "this model is equivalent to a two - leg ladder ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , where the coupling along ( between ) the legs of the ladder is equal to @xmath3 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by :    h&=&_i[j_1(s_i^xs_i+1^x+s_i^ys_i+1^ys_i^zs_i+1^z)&&+_ij_2(s_i^xs_i+2^x+s_i^ys_i+2^y+s_i^zs_i+2^z ) ] , [ h ] where we have allowed for an exchange anisotropy @xmath4 .",
    "= 3.0truein    the zigzag ladder model is believed to describe the quantum magnet @xmath5 @xcite above the magnetic ordering transition .",
    "the ratio of exchange constants is estimated as @xmath6 @xcite , so that the interchain coupling is significantly smaller than the exchange along the legs of the ladder .",
    "a second well - studied material with zigzag structure is @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "however , in @xmath8 the chains appear to be coupled in an entire plane and no pronounced ladder structure is present .",
    "the model in the regime @xmath9 has been studied previously using both numerical @xcite and field - theoretical @xcite methods .",
    "the main dmrg results for the spin rotationally symmetric case ( @xmath10 ) and not too large values of @xmath11 are the following @xcite    * the ground state is doubly degenerate and is characterized by a nonzero dimerisation @xmath12 . *",
    "the equal - time correlation function @xmath13 exhibits an oscillating exponential decay at large spatial separations .",
    "the characteristic angle associated with these oscillations , i.e. the incommensurability , is related to the correlation length @xmath14 by -1=. this connection of incommensurability and correlation length also fits into the picture emerging from the renormalisation group analysis ( valid in the limit @xmath15 ) of @xcite , which yields the _ simultaneous _ divergence , with fixed ratio , of the related coupling constants .",
    "the regime @xmath15 is very difficult to analyse numerically as both the dimerisation and the incommensurability become very small . in particular , the dmrg analysis of @xcite did not consider this regime . at the same time",
    "the field theory studies of @xcite suggest that for @xmath15 and @xmath16 a different type of physics may emerge : there are still incommensurate correlations and dimerisation , but in addition there is also `` chiral '' order & & ^+_2ns^-_2n+2-s^-_2ns^+_2n+20,&&^+_2ns^-_2n-1-s^-_2ns^+_2n-10  .",
    "such type of order is forbidden in the isotropic case @xmath10 .",
    "it clearly would be interesting to numerically analyse whether or not such a new phase indeed exists . given the difficulties , mainly due to finite - size effects , in accessing the relevant parameter regime by numerical methods , we propose in essence to _ utilise _ finite - size effects to extract information on the incommensurability present in the system .",
    "this is done by studying the effects of twisted boundary conditions on the energy levels .",
    "our main purpose is to establish the viability of our method by carrying out exact diagonalisation of finite clusters of up to 24 sites . in order to obtain definitive results on the zigzag chain in the most interesting parameter regime ,",
    "larger systems need to be studied , possibly by implementing tba into a dmrg algorithm .",
    "we found the ground state of the system by lanczos diagonalization of rings of size @xmath17 , 16 , 20 and 24 sites in the subspaces of total spin projection @xmath18 , 1 , for each total wave number @xmath19 .",
    "we used twisted boundary conditions ( tbc ) @xmath20 .",
    "this means that each time a spin down traverses one particular link , it acquires a phase @xmath21 ( @xmath22 if it moves to the right ( left ) . in the fermionic representation , after a wigner - jordan transformation @xmath23 , and a gauge transformation @xmath24 , the problem becomes equivalent to a system of @xmath25 fermions ( @xmath26 ) on a ring threaded by a flux @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the number of spins down .",
    "the advantage of the tbc for our purposes is that the allowed total wave vectors are :    @xmath29    with @xmath30 integer .",
    "thus , varying @xmath27 , we have access to a continuum of possible wave vectors , even if we are working on a finite system @xcite . as an example , the ground state of eq .",

    ", the exact @xmath19 s and ground state energies are reproduced , if the energy of a small ring is minimized as a function of flux @xmath27 and discrete wave number ( @xmath30 ) .    for @xmath35 ,",
    "the transverse spin correlations dominate at large distances .",
    "we denote the ground state of the system by @xmath36 .",
    "it lies in the @xmath18 sector and its wave vector for pbc ( or tbc if the energy is minimized over @xmath27 ) is always @xmath37 or @xmath38 . for the transverse spin correlations we can write :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the fourier transform of @xmath41 , and the sum over @xmath42 runs over all excited states .    by symmetry , for each @xmath43 , only excited states with @xmath44 and @xmath45 have nonvanishing matrix elements in eq .",
    "( [ cf ] ) .",
    "we now assume that the large - distance asymptotics of @xmath46 is determined by the lowest excited state in the @xmath44 sector .",
    "the difference in wave number between this state and the ground state then gives the incommensurability @xmath47 .",
    "for a finite system , in order to represent a continuum of wave vectors , we minimize the energy in the @xmath44 sector @xmath48 , as a function of flux and allowed discrete wave vectors for this flux ( see eq .",
    "( [ ks ] ) ) .",
    "the wave vector of the excitation is taken as :    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the flux which minimizes @xmath48 , and @xmath51 is the wave vector of the state of lowest energy in the @xmath52 sector at flux @xmath27 .",
    "the wave vector @xmath47 gives the period of the oscillations of the spin correlations and corresponds to the pitch angle @xmath53 of the classical spiral density wave @xcite .",
    "we have also investigated the energy gap of the spectrum . for a finite system",
    "we evaluate it as :    @xmath54    here @xmath55 is the flux which minimizes the ground - state energy @xmath56 .",
    "there are alternative expressions to @xmath47 and @xmath57 which converge to the same value in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "our experience suggests that the ones we chose have the fastest convergence .    to test the method ,",
    "we have studied a dimerized half filled system of non interacting spinless fermions .",

    "as long as @xmath79 is larger than @xmath80 ( small systems ) , the results for pbc are better if @xmath68 is multiple of 8 . however , the oscillations with increasing @xmath68 for pbc make a finite - size scaling difficult .",

    "= 3.0truein    there is indeed evidence suggesting that finite - size effects are still significant for @xmath123 .",

    "the dmrg studies of @xcite show that in the isotropic case and for long lattices the two lowest levels are both in the @xmath125 sector ( degenerate ground states corresponding to different signs of the dimerisation ) .",
    "we note that the presence of such finite - size effects does not necessary imply that the extrapolated results for the incommensurability are incorrect . in order to resolve this issue",
    "it is necessary to study significantly longer lattices .",
    "we have calculated the incommensurate wave number in the next - nearest - neighbor heisenberg model with anisotropy @xmath120 , by exact diagonalization of rings of up to 24 sites .",
    "we have used twisted boundary conditions and assumed that the incommensurate spin fluctuations for @xmath35 are determined by the lowest excited state for total spin projection @xmath127 .",
    "the method is able to detect incommensurate angles @xmath128 .",
    "this corresponds to a wave length of the order of 10 000 sites and is impossible to detect by using alternative numerical methods .",

    "the method does not predict incommensurabilities in cases where it is known that none exist .",

    "we have shown that incommensurabilities can be detected by diagonalizing finite - size clusters with tbc .",
    "the main advantage of the method is that the dependence of the incommensurability on system size is very smooth and allows extrapolation from results for relatively short chains",
