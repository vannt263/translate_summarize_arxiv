    "as the only missing particle in the standard model ( sm ) , the higgs boson is being intensively hunted at the lhc . recently ,",
    "both the atlas and cms experiments have revealed hints of a higgs particle around @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "while such a higgs mass can be well accommodated in the sm and the reported signal rates in several channels are also in agreement with the sm expectations after taking into account the large experimental uncertainty @xcite ( albeit the central value of the observed di - photon rate is somewhat above the sm prediction ) , the low energy supersymmetry ( susy ) seems to be a better framework to account for such a higgs . in low energy susy",
    "the sm - like higgs mass is theoretically restricted in a narrow range and its di - photon rate at the lhc may exceed the sm prediction @xcite , both of which are welcomed by the lhc results .    however , as the most popular low energy susy model , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite may have some tension to accommodate such a 125 gev higgs . as is well known , in the mssm the sm - like higgs mass is upper bounded by @xmath7 at tree - level and to get a higgs around @xmath6 we need sizable top / stop loop contributions , which depend quartically on the top quark mass and logarithmically on the stop masses @xcite .",
    "this will , on the one hand , impose rather tight constraint on the mssm , and on the other hand , incur some fine - tuning @xcite .",
    "such a problem can be alleviated in the so - called next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) @xcite , which is the simplest singlet extension of the mssm with a scale invariant superpotential . in the nmssm , due to the introduction of some new couplings in the superpotential",
    ", the sm - like higgs mass gets additional contribution at tree - level and also may be further pushed up by the mixing effect in diagonalizing the mass matrix of the cp - even higgs fields @xcite . as a result , a sm - like higgs around @xmath6 does not entail large loop contributions , which may thus ameliorate the fine - tuning problem @xcite .    in this work , motivated by the recent lhc results",
    ", we assume a sm - like higgs boson in @xmath8 and study its implication in the mssm and nmssm .",
    "different from recent studies in this direction @xcite , we scan the model parameters by considering various experimental constraints and perform a comparative study for the mssm and nmssm .",
    "we will investigate the features of the allowed parameter space in each model and particularly we pay more attention to the space of the nmssm which may be distinct from the mssm .",
    "noting the lhc experiments utilize the channels @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 in searching for the higgs boson @xcite , we also study their normalized production rates defined as @xmath12 where @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are respectively the rescaled couplings of the higgs to gluons , photons and weak gauge bosons by their sm values .",
    "we are more interested in the case with @xmath17 because it is favored by current atlas and cms results @xcite .",
    "as will be shown below , this case usually predicts a slepton or a chargino lighter than @xmath18 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we recapitulate the characters of the higgs mass in the models for better understanding our numerical results . in sec .",
    "iii , we perform a comprehensive scan over the parameter space of each model by imposing current experimental constraints and also by requiring a sm - like higgs boson in @xmath19 .",
    "then we scrutinize the properties of the surviving parameter space . finally , we draw our conclusions in sec",
    "in the mssm , the higgs sector consists of two doublet fileds @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which after the electroweak symmetry breaking , result in five physical higgs bosons : two cp - even scalars @xmath22 and @xmath23 , one cp - odd pseudoscalar @xmath24 and a pair of charged scalars @xmath25@xcite .",
    "traditionally , such a higgs sector is described by the ratio of the higgs vacuum expectation values , @xmath26 , and the mass of the pseudoscalar @xmath27 . in most of the mssm parameter space ,",
    "the lightest higgs boson @xmath22 has largest coupling to vector bosons ( i.e. the so - called sm - like higgs boson ) , and for moderate @xmath28 and large @xmath27 its mass is given by @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath33 being the stop masses , @xmath34 with @xmath2 denoting the trilinear higgs - stop coupling and @xmath35 being the higgsino mass parameter .",
    "obviously , the larger @xmath28 or @xmath36 is , the heavier @xmath22 becomes , and for given @xmath36 , @xmath37 reaches its maximum when @xmath38 , which corresponds to the so - called @xmath39 scenario .    about eq.([mh ] ) , three points should be noted @xcite .",
    "the first is this equation is only valid for small splitting between @xmath32 and @xmath33 . in case of large splitting ,",
    "generally @xmath40 is needed to maximize @xmath37 .",
    "the second is @xmath41 in eq.([mh ] ) is symmetric with respect to the sign of @xmath42 .",
    "this behavior will be spoiled once higher order corrections are considered , and usually a larger @xmath37 is achieved for positive @xmath43 with @xmath44 being gluino soft breaking mass . and",
    "the last is in eq.([mh ] ) , we do not include the contributions from the sbottom and slepton sectors .",
    "such contributions are negative and become significant only for large @xmath28 .    compared with the mssm , the higgs sector in the nmssm is rather complex , which can be seen from its superpotential and the corresponding soft - breaking terms given by @xcite @xmath45 here @xmath46 is the superpotential of the mssm without the @xmath35 term , the dimensionless parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the coefficients of the higgs self couplings , and @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the soft - breaking parameters .    after the electroweak symmetry breaking , the three soft breaking masses squared for @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath54 can be expressed in terms of their vevs ( i.e. @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) through the minimization conditions of the scalar potential .",
    "so in contrast to the mssm where there are only two parameters in the higgs sector , the higgs sector of the nmssm is described by six parameters @xcite : @xmath58 the higgs fields can be written in the following form : @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 with @xmath62 and @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are goldstone bosons and @xmath66 . in the cp - conserving nmssm ,",
    "the fields @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 mix to form three physical cp - even higgs bosons , and @xmath70 and @xmath71 mix to form two physical cp - odd higgs bosons .",
    "obviously , the field @xmath72 corresponds to the sm higgs field , and the scalar @xmath22 with largest @xmath68 component is called the sm - like higgs boson .    under the basis ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) , the elements of the mass matrix for @xmath73 fields at tree level are given by @xcite @xmath74,\\\\ { \\cal m}^2_{33}&= & \\frac{1}{4 } \\lambda^2 v^2 ( \\frac{m_a \\sin 2\\beta}{\\mu})^2 + \\frac{\\kappa\\mu}{\\lambda } ( a_\\kappa +   \\frac{4\\kappa\\mu}{\\lambda } )   - \\frac{1}{2 } \\lambda \\kappa v^2 \\sin 2 \\beta , \\label{33}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 is nothing but @xmath41 at tree level without considering the mixing among @xmath73 , and its second term @xmath76 originates from the coupling @xmath77 in the superpotential .",
    "for such a complex matrix , it is useful to consider two scenarios for understanding the results :    * scenario i : @xmath78 and @xmath35 is fixed . in this limit , since @xmath79 , the singlet field @xmath69 is decoupled from the doublet fields , and the mssm mass matrix is recovered for the ( @xmath67,@xmath68 ) system .",
    "this scenario indicates that , even for moderate @xmath47 and @xmath48 , @xmath37 should change little from its mssm prediction .",
    "so in order to show the difference of the two models in predicting @xmath37 , we are more interested in large @xmath47 case . especially we will mainly discuss @xmath80 case , where the tree level contributions to @xmath41 , i.e. @xmath75 , are maximized for moderate values of @xmath28 rather than by large values of @xmath28 as in the mssm .",
    "* scenario ii : @xmath81 and @xmath82 , which can be easily realized for a large @xmath83 . in this limit",
    ", @xmath67 is decoupled from the ( @xmath68,@xmath69 ) system and the properties of @xmath37 can be qualitatively understood by the @xmath84 matrix @xcite @xmath85 where @xmath86 denotes the radiative corrections to @xmath37 with its form given by the last two terms of eq.([mh ] ) , and @xmath87 represents the potentially important effect of ( @xmath67,@xmath69 ) mixing on @xmath88 .",
    "this matrix indicates that the ( @xmath68,@xmath69 ) mixing can push @xmath37 up once @xmath89 , and such effect is maximized for @xmath90 slightly larger than @xmath91 and at the same time @xmath92 slightly below @xmath93 ( larger @xmath94 will destabilize the vacuum ) @xcite . obviously , in this push - up case",
    ", @xmath22 is the next - to - lightest cp - even higgs boson and the larger the ( @xmath95 ) mixing is , the heavier @xmath22 becomes .",
    "alternatively , the mixing can pull @xmath37 down on the condition of @xmath96 , which occurs for large @xmath97 ( for @xmath98 , see discussion below ) as indicated by the expression of @xmath99 and the positiveness of @xmath87 . here",
    "we remind that , due to the extra contribution @xmath76 to @xmath41 at tree level , @xmath37 in the pull - down case may still be larger than its mssm prediction for a certain @xmath86 . +",
    "since our results presented below is approximately described by scenario ii , we now estimate the features of its favored region to predict @xmath100 .",
    "first , since @xmath101 , @xmath102 implies that @xmath103 .",
    "numerically , we find @xmath103 for the push - up case , and @xmath104 for the pull - down case ( see fig.[fig7 ] ) .",
    "second , @xmath105 must be relatively small , which implies that @xmath98 for @xmath106 .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "in the push - up case , since @xmath107 , the condition @xmath108 ( for vacuum stability ) has limited the size of @xmath109 . while in the pull - down case , a very large @xmath109 will suppress greatly @xmath37 to make it difficult to reach @xmath6 , and this in return limits the size of @xmath109 .",
    "given that @xmath110 as required by the lep bound on chargino mass and that a larger @xmath35 is favored for the pull - down scenario , one can infer that the value of @xmath111 should be around 2 after considering that the third term in @xmath109 is less important .",
    "numerically speaking , we find @xmath112 and @xmath113 ( see fig.[fig7 ] ) .",
    "lastly , light stops may be possible in the nmssm with large @xmath47 to predict @xmath100 . to see this",
    ", we consider the parameters @xmath114 and @xmath115 , and we get @xmath116 without considering the mixing effect to predict @xmath100 . this is in sharp contrast with @xmath117 in mssm for @xmath118 .    in this work we use the package nmssmtools @xcite to calculate the higgs masses and mixings , which includes the dominant one - loop and leading logarithmic two - loop corrections to @xmath119 .",

    "ii , besides the soft parameters in the stop sector , the sensitive parameters include @xmath28 , @xmath35 , @xmath48 as well as @xmath232 . in fig.[fig6 ] , we project the surviving samples in the planes of @xmath35 versus @xmath216 and versus @xmath48 .",
    "this figure shows three distinctive characters for the allowed parameters .",
    "the first is that @xmath28 must be moderate , below 4 and 9 for the pull - down and the push - up case , respectively .",
    "two reasons can account for it .",
    "one is that in the nmssm with large @xmath47 , the precision electroweak data , i.e. the constraint ( 4 ) , strongly disfavor a large @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the other reason is that , as far as @xmath106 is concerned , a moderate @xmath28 is welcomed to enhance the tree level value of @xmath41 ( i.e. @xmath233 ) so that even without heavy stops , @xmath37 can still reach @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , since the ( @xmath214 ) mixing is to reduce the value of @xmath213 in eq.([re - m ] ) in the pull - down case , a larger @xmath88 ( or equivalently a smaller @xmath28 ) is favored by the higgs mass .",
    "the second character is that @xmath97 in the push - up case is usually much smaller than that in the pull - down case .",
    "this is because , as we introduced in sec .",
    "ii , a large @xmath97 is needed by the pull - down case to enhance @xmath88 in eq.([re - m ] ) .",
    "the third character is obtained by comparing the parameter regions in the upper panels with those in the lower panels , which shows that @xmath17 puts a lower bound on @xmath48 , i.e. @xmath234 . the underlying reason is that for @xmath235 , the dark matter will be light and singlino - like , and to get its currently measured relic density , the dark matter must annihilate in the early universe by exchanging a light higgs boson @xcite . in this case",
    ", @xmath22 mainly decays into the light bosons , which in return will suppress the di - photon rate .    , but showing the correlation between @xmath232 and @xmath236 .",
    "the dashed line denotes the relation @xmath237.,width=264 ]    in fig.[fig7 ] we show the correlation of @xmath232 with @xmath236 .",
    "this figure indicates that @xmath238 for the push - up case and @xmath239 for the pull - down case , which is in agreement with our expectation .",
    "in fact , we checked each surviving sample and found it satisfies the condition : @xmath240 and @xmath241 , so the samples can be well described by scenario ii .",
    "we also checked that the mixing of the field @xmath67 with @xmath68/@xmath69 is small and @xmath232 is approximately the heaviest cp - even higgs boson mass .",
    "fig.[fig7 ] also indicates that the relation @xmath242 is maintained quite well in the push - up case , but is moderately spoiled in the pull - down case .",
    "the reason is , as we introduced in sec .",
    "ii , the requirement that @xmath109 should be moderately small actually implies @xmath243 with @xmath244 . in the push - up case",
    "the third term in @xmath245 is not important , while in the pull case , although it is several times smaller than the second term , it may not be negligible .",
    "we checked our results and found @xmath246 and @xmath247 for all the surviving samples .",
    "about the nmssm with @xmath106 , three points should be noted .",
    "the first is , from the results presented in fig.[fig6 ] , one may find the presence of a smuon and/or a chargino lighter than @xmath248 .",
    "this is because the surviving samples are characterized either by @xmath249 or @xmath250 or by both in the nmssm ( see fig.[fig6 ] ) . then to explain the discrepancy of muon anomalous magnetic moment @xmath251",
    "is needed for a low @xmath216 , and @xmath252 implies @xmath253 .",
    "we numerically checked the validity of this conclusion .",
    "the second point is , although @xmath254 may be regarded as a new source of fine tuning in the nmssm , it is rather predictive to get the value of @xmath232 once @xmath35 and @xmath28 are experimental determined .",
    "finally , we note the favored region for @xmath35 and @xmath28 shown in fig.[fig6 ] does not overlap with that in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "this may be used to discriminate the models .    , but projected on the plane of the charged higgs boson mass and @xmath216.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] , but projected on the plane of the charged higgs boson mass and @xmath216.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    finally , we briefly describe other implications of @xmath100 in the susy models . in fig.[fig8 ]",
    "we project the surviving samples on the plane of @xmath28 versus @xmath255 with @xmath256 denoting the charged higgs boson .",
    "this figure shows that @xmath256 must be heavier than about @xmath176 in the mssm .",
    "this bound is much higher than the corresponding lep bound , which is about @xmath257 . for the nmssm with a large @xmath47",
    ", the bound can be further pushed up to about @xmath184 .",
    "this figure also indicates that in the mssm , @xmath28 may reach 35 for @xmath258 .",
    "then based on the mc simulation by the atlas collaboration @xcite , one may expect that the charged higgs may be observable from the process @xmath259 at the early stage of the lhc",
    ". however , this may be impossible .",
    "the reason is , for relatively light @xmath256 and large @xmath28 , @xmath35 must be large to satisfy the constraint from dark matter direct detection experiments such as xenon100 .",
    "this will greatly suppress the @xmath260 coupling @xcite .",
    "for the nmssm , the hope to observe @xmath256 is also dim because @xmath28 is small .    , but",
    "exhibiting the spin - independent @xmath261-nucleon scattering cross section as a function of the dark matter mass.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] , but exhibiting the spin - independent @xmath261-nucleon scattering cross section as a function of the dark matter mass.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    in fig.[fig9 ] we show the spin - independent elastic scattering between dark matter and nucleon .",
    "we use the formula presented in the appendix of @xcite to calculate the scattering rate . as expected , the xenon100 ( 2012 ) data to be released in near future will further exclude some samples , especially the pull - down case of the nmssm",
    "will be strongly disfavored if xenon100 ( 2012 ) fails to find any evidence of dark matter ( assuming the grand unification relation of the gaugino mass ) .",
    "from the left of fig.[fig9 ] one can learn that for the samples with @xmath17 in the mssm , the scattering rate is small , usually at least one order below than the sensitivity of the xenon100 ( 2012 ) .",
    "motivated by the recent lhc hints of a higgs boson around 125 gev , we assume a sm - like higgs with the mass 123 - 127 gev and study its implication in low energy susy by comparing the mssm and nmssm . under various experimental constraints at @xmath0 level ( including the muon @xmath1 and the dark matter relic density ) , we scanned over the parameter space of each model",
    ". then in the parameter space allowed by current experimental constraints and also predicting a sm - like higgs in 123 - 127 gev , we examined the properties of the sensitive parameters and calculated the rates of the di - photon signal and the @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) signals at the lhc . among our various findings",
    "the typical ones are : ( i ) in the mssm the top squark and @xmath2 must be large and thus incur some fine - tuning , which can be much ameliorated in the nmssm ; ( ii ) in the mssm a light @xmath262 is needed to make the di - photon rate of the sm - like higgs exceed its sm prediction , while the nmssm has more ways in doing this ; ( iii ) in the mssm the signal rates of @xmath5 at the lhc are never enhanced compared with their sm predictions , while in the nmssm they may be enhanced ; ( iv ) a large part of the parameter space so far survived will be soon covered by the expected xenon100(2012 ) sensitivity ( especially for the nmssm ) .    therefore , although the low energy susy can in general accommodate a sm - like higgs boson near 125 gev and enhance its di - photon signal rate at the lhc , not all models of low energy susy are equally competent if they are required to satisfy all current experimental constraints . from our present study and some other studies in the literature ,",
    "we conclude :    * the fancy cmssm / msugra is hard to give a 125 gev sm - like higgs boson @xcite .",
    "* the mssm can give such a 125 gev higgs and can also enhance its di - photon signal rate at the lhc , which , however , will incur some fine - tuning . * the nmssm ( the nearly minimal susy model ) can give a 125 gev sm - like higgs , but severely suppress its di - photon signal rate at the lhc @xcite . *",
    "the nmssm is so far the best model to accommodate such a 125 gev higgs ; it can naturally ( without fine - tuning ) predict such a sm - like higgs mass and readily enhance its di - photon signal rate at the lhc . at the same time , in a large part of its parameter space , this model can also enhance the signal rates @xmath5 ( @xmath263 ) at the lhc and predict a large scattering rate of dark matter and nucleon at the xenon100 .",
    "so the interplay of lhc and xenon100 will soon allow for a good test of this model .",
