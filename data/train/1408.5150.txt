    "continuum electroweak production of top quark pairs at future linear colliders is of considerable interest because it allows for a precise measurement of the top quark forward - backward asymmetry .",
    "this observable is of particular importance because it is expected to severely constrain anomalous couplings which could potentially appear in the top quark sector  @xcite . in the near future , due to the extremely clean environment expected at proposed @xmath1 colliders",
    ", it should be possible to measure the top quark forward - backward asymmetry to a precision of approximately @xmath2  @xcite .    at an @xmath0 collider , top quark pairs are primarily produced via the electroweak process @xmath3 in this paper , we shall only concern ourselves with the next - to - next - to - leading order  ( nnlo ) radiative corrections to the above process in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) mediated by an off - shell photon ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "in other words , we treat the vector current contributions to the production of a top - antitop pair .",
    "complete results including the axial - vector contributions ( _ i.e. _ that due to off - shell @xmath5 boson exchange ) will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the calculation of qcd radiative corrections to heavy - quark pair production in @xmath0 annihilation has a long history .",
    "full next - to - leading order  ( nlo ) qcd corrections were first computed in ref .",
    "@xcite and , a short time later , nlo electroweak effects were considered in ref .",
    "nlo qcd corrections to top quark pair production including the subsequent top quark decays were presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and nlo qcd corrections to top quark spin correlations were computed in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "total cross sections are known to nnlo in the threshold expansions  @xcite and high - energy expansions  @xcite .",
    "results for the forward - backward asymmetry are also known in the small mass approximation  @xcite . in the near future",
    ", the threshold cross section at nnnlo will also be available  @xcite .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , although a great deal of theoretical progress has been made over the years , exact nnlo qcd calculations for fully differential @xmath6 observables remain a challenge and are still missing from the literature .",
    "a fully differential nnlo qcd calculation is naturally split up into three distinct parts , depending on the number of particles that appear in the final state relative to leading order : a ) purely virtual two - loop or squared one - loop corrections , b ) one - loop , single - emission real - virtual corrections , and c ) double - emission double - real corrections . for @xmath6 ,",
    "significant progress has been made in recent years towards the calculation of each of these three pieces .",
    "nlo qcd corrections to heavy quark pair production in association with one additional jet were computed in refs .",
    "the two - loop heavy quark form factor was first obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite and then confirmed some time later by an independent calculation  @xcite .",
    "in fact , for quite some time , the only outstanding problem was to construct an efficient framework for the combination of the ingredients described above into an infrared - safe monte carlo event generator .",
    "for generic processes , this is highly non - trivial due to the fact that , in phase space regions where soft and/or collinear limits are approached , the real - virtual and double - real contributions develop soft and/or collinear divergences which must be extracted before a monte carlo integration over phase space can be carried out . at nlo , this is relatively straightforward to do and both phase - space slicing  @xcite and subtraction  @xcite techniques which solve the problem were worked out long time ago .",
    "however , as is clear from the massive amount of literature on the subject  @xcite , analogous techniques at nnlo are considerably more complicated to develop and complete solutions took much longer to emerge .",
    "for example , in the important case of massless dijet production , it took more than a decade for the first physical predictions to appear  @xcite from the time that the relevant two - loop virtual amplitudes were first calculated  @xcite . as a result of significant theoretical efforts during the past decade ,",
    "a number of important `` benchmark processes '' are now known to nnlo  @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study fully differential nnlo qcd corrections to @xmath6 using a higher - order generalization of the phase - space slicing method .",
    "while we constrain ourselves in this paper to present results for the vector current contributions by themselves , the formalism developed here can , if desired , readily be used to calculate the contributions coming from the exchange of an off - shell @xmath5 boson .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : slice ] , we describe our calculational method in detail . in section  [ sec : num ]",
    ", we present numerical results for various inclusive and differential observables and , whenever possible , compare them to the existing literature .",
    "finally , we conclude in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we explain in detail our generalization of phase - space slicing method in dealing with the specific process @xmath6 at nnlo .",

    "@xmath12 denotes the @xmath13-loop amplitude for @xmath14 plus zero , one , or two additional massless partons .",
    "note that when @xmath15 , the channel for the production of @xmath16 is open .",
    "however , these additional contributions are themselves infrared finite due to the mass of top quark , and can be dealt with separately . in the following discussion",
    ", we will neglect these contributions .",
    "also for the vector contributions , we only consider diagrams with top quarks coupling directly to photon .",
    "the diagrams with photon coupling to a bottom or light quarks and the top quark produced via gluon splitting are numerically small  @xcite . though the bottom triangle diagrams are needed and must be included to cancel the axial anomaly in the axial vector case  @xcite .",
    "the first , second , and third terms on the rhs of eq.([eq : sigma2 ] ) represent respectively the double - virtual , real - virtual , and double - real contributions .",
    "the double - virtual contributions contain explicit quadratic poles in @xmath17 , originating from loop corrections when the gluons are soft .",
    "thanks to bloch - nordsieck and kinoshita - lee - nauenberg theorem , the infrared divergences will be cancelled by those in the real - virtual and double - real contributions . however , such cancellation is non - trivial because the infrared divergences in the real - virutal and double - real contributions can only be made explicit _",
    "after _ phase space integral .",
    "it is therefore necessary to perform the phase space integral in @xmath18 dimension to regulate potential infrared divergences .",
    "this fact makes the calculation of real - virtual and double - real contributions difficult .",
    "the singular region in the phase space is relatively simple for the real - virtual corrections , where the matrix elements are singular only when the energy of the final state gluon approaches zero .",
    "for the double - real contributions the singular region is much more involved .",
    "first , the matrix elements are singular in the double un - resolved region , where the energies of both the final state partons approach zero .",
    "second , the matrix elements are also singular even in the single un - resolved region , where only one of the final state gluon is soft , or the final state massless partons become collinear . fortunately , the singularities due to single un - resolved region is well understood , as they are the same one encounters in nlo qcd calculation .",
    "we therefore only need to deal with the double un - resolved region . to isolate the phase space singularities in this region ,",
    "we introduce a phase - space slicing parameter @xmath19 , which is proportional to the total energy of qcd radiations in the final state , @xmath20 .",
    "physically , when @xmath19 is non - zero , there is at least one massless parton in the final state with finite energy . we can divide the phase space into two slices using the theta function , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the soft - virtual part , and @xmath23 is the hard part , and @xmath24 is the cut - off parameter .",
    "there are still phase space singularities in both @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "however , the phase space singularties in @xmath26 belong to the well understood one , because there is at most one massless parton in the final state whose energy can approach zero .",
    "we can therefore straight - forwardly calculate @xmath26 using any existing nlo infrared subtraction method . on the other hand ,",
    "the soft - virtual part , @xmath27 , contains double un - resolved region , whose calculation needs additional efforts .",
    "an exact calculation for @xmath27 is difficult .",
    "however , if we choose @xmath24 to be small and ignore terms of @xmath28 , we can calculate @xmath27 using matrix elements in the soft limit , and also expanding the phase space volume in the soft limit .",
    "such approximation leads to enormous simplification and makes the analytical calculation feasible .",
    "we explain in detail the calculation of the soft - virtual part and hard part below .",
    "we can write the soft - virtual part as an integral over radiation - energy distribution , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is twice the energy of final state qcd radiations , @xmath31 .",
    "the factor of @xmath32 here is introduced by convention .",
    "ignoring power suppressed terms in @xmath33 , we can write the distribution for @xmath34 in small @xmath30 in a factorized form using the language of effective theory .",

    "the lepton tensor includes only vector contributions from virtual photon exchange , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the qed coupling , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the four momentum of positron and electron .",
    "the production of top - quark pair via virtual photon exchange is described by two qcd currents , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the electric charge number of top quark , and @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : qcdfac ] ) is exact to leading order in electroweak interaction , and all orders in qcd interactions .",
    "it is also an exact distributions for @xmath30 .",
    "calculation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : qcdfac ] ) in perturbative qcd requires the calculation of both virtual corrections and phase space integral .",
    "unfortunately , exact calculation of phase space integral is difficult beyond nlo .",

    "since we are only interested in the energy distribution in the soft region , we can expand eq .",
    "( [ eq : qcdfac ] ) to leading power in @xmath33 .",
    "then the momentum conservation delta function factorizes as @xmath46 in the region where @xmath47 .",
    "the physics of such factorization is that as long as the energy of qcd radiations is small , they can hardly change the trajectory of heavy quark .",
    "the short - distance interaction which produces the top - quark pair can not resolve the activities of soft qcd radiations , therefore have tree - level like kinematics .",
