    "the concept of strange star ( ss ) is not a new one .",
    "itoh ( 1970 ) first proposed a model for it even when the qcd theory did not reach its current status . during this period bodmer ( 1971 ) discussed about an astrophysical object collapsed from its usual state formed by nucleonic matter .",
    "he argued that collapsed nuclei have radii much smaller than ordinary nuclei .",
    "then witten ( 1984 ) suggested that the early universe may have undergone a first order phase transition from high temperature dense quark phase to low temperature dilute baryonic phase , both the phases being stable with local minima .",
    "the low temperature phase grow and gradually occupy more than half of the volume . at this point",
    "the high temperature regions detach from each other into isolated bubbles",
    ". then further expansion of the universe results in cooling in low temperature phase .",
    "these bubbles may survive till today in the form of strange stars .",
    "he also conjectured that the true ground state of matter is  strange quark matter ( sqm ) \" , not @xmath0 .",
    "sqm is a bulk quark matter phase consisting of roughly equal numbers of up , down and strange quarks plus a small number of electrons to guarantee charge neutrality .",
    "sqm would then have a lower energy per baryon than ordinary nuclei and manifests in the form of strange stars .",
    "but the ss hypothesis is not till beyond skepticism .",
    "the maximum mass - radius obtained in ss models are usually lower than that obtained from neutron star ( ns ) models .",
    "so ss models face difficulties in explaining the high mass stars like psr j0751 + 1807 ( nice et al . , 2005 ) and exo 0748 - 676 ( ozel , 2006 ) which have masses @xmath1 .",
    "even only a very few stiff neutron matter equations of state ( esos ) can explain the estimated mass - radius of exo 0748 - 676 ( ozel , 2006 ) .",
    "on the other hand , there are some observational features which are easier to explain with ss model rather than ns model . as examples , harmonic absorption lines in the x - ray spectrum of compact stars like 1e 1207.4@xmath25209 , j1210@xmath25226 , rx j1856.@xmath23754 @xmath3 ,",
    "can be explained as the consequences of compressional modes of surface vibrations of ss ( sinha @xmath4 2003 ) .",
    "ss can produce such oscillations since they have sharp surfaces and are self bound with zero pressure at the surface , where energy per baryon ( e / a ) is minimum and the density is non - zero .",
    "such harmonic compressional modes are not possible for a neutron star because of the lack of minimum in e / a .",
    "another observed feature , superburst , faces difficulties in using the standard carbon burning scenario within neutron star models .",
    "sinha @xmath5 ( 2002 ) proposed an alternative scenario as the formation of diquark pairs on the strange star surface and their subsequent breaking - giving a continuous and prolonged emission of energy comparable with that emitted during the superbursts .",
    "so we are supporting the view that both ss and ns exists in nature and under suitable physical condition an ns may convert to an ss leading to energy outburst ( bombaci @xmath5 2004 , staff @xmath5 2007 ) .",
    "but further study is needed to pinpoint the condition which will give rise to such a transition .    with this view , we feel it is intriguing to study the properties of ss by matching theoretical predictions ( of mass , radius etc . ) with astronomical observations .",
    "one such property is the temperature dependence of the mass and the radius of an ss as it cools ( by neutrino or photon emission ) or heats up ( by accreting matter ) . in this paper ,",
    "the effect of temperature on sqm eos is studied .",
    "we show that an increase in temperature leads to a softening of the sqm eos giving rise to a decrease in maximum mass of the ss .",
    "when the temperature drops , the eos stiffens again .",
    "we show that this leads to _ chromo - thermal _ instability which has interesting implications in astrophysics .",
    "there are several eoss for sqm , such as the bag model ( alcock @xmath5 1986 , haensel @xmath5 1986 , kettner @xmath5 1995 ) , the perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) model ( fraga @xmath5 2001 ) , the chiral chromodielectric model ( malheiro @xmath5 2003 ) etc .",
    "however , in all these models , the effect of finite temperature was not sufficiently studied .",
    "such study has been performed in the present work using the relativistic mean field model ( dey @xmath4 1998 , bagchi @xmath5 2006 ) for sqm .",
    "the other novelty in this model is that here chiral symmetry is restored at high densities due to the introduction of a density dependence of quark masses .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : our model for ss is briefly discussed in @xmath6 [ sec : model ] and @xmath6 [ sec : sstobh ] is devoted to the study of ss properties at finite temperatures including the _ chromo - thermal _ instability and possible collapse of an ss to a black hole . in @xmath6 [ sec : appl ] , we have discussed the relevance of our results in the astrophysics of core collapse supernovae and gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "we conclude in @xmath6 [ sec : conclude ] with a suggestion on how these oscillations can be observed .",
    "strange stars are more compact than neutron stars and fit into the bodmer@xmath2witten hypothesis for the existence of sqm . in the relativistic hartree - fock calculation for the sqm eos , dey @xmath5 ( 1998 )",
    "used a phenomenological inter - quark interaction , namely the richardson potential ( richardson , 1979 ) .",
    "this potential takes care of two features of the inter - quark force , namely asymptotic freedom ( af ) and confinement with the same scale , which is not true from theoretical considerations .",
    "later , ss properties have been calculated with a modified richardson potential having different scales for af and confinement .",
    "the scale values were obtained from baryon magnetic moment calculations ( bagchi @xmath5 2004 ) . in this model , chiral symmetry restoration at high density is incorporated by introducing density dependent quark masses .",
    "a temperature dependence of gluon mass is considered in addition to its usual density dependence .",
    "the gluon mass represents the medium effect , resulting in the screening of the inter - quark interaction . the temperature effect through the fermi function",
    "is also incorporated and at non - zero temperature , free energy @xmath7 is used instead of energy @xmath8 while calculating the eos .",
    "it is also ensured that in sqm , the chemical potentials of the quarks satisfy @xmath9 equilibrium and charge neutrality conditions .",
    "the parameters of the model are adjusted in such a way that the minimum value of @xmath10 for u , d , s quark matter is less than that of fe@xmath11 , so that u , d , s quark matter can constitute stable stars .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath10 is obtained at the star surface where the pressure is zero .",
    "however , the minimum value of @xmath10 for u , d quark matter is greater than that of fe@xmath11 so that fe@xmath11 remains the most stable element in the non - strange world . with the obtained esos , tolman  oppenheimer ",
    "volkov equations for hydrostatic equilibrium are solved to get the structures of the stars at different temperatures ( bagchi @xmath5 2006 ) .",
    "the increase of temperature softens the sqm eos ( @xmath12 , where p is the pressure and @xmath13 is the energy density - see fig.[fig : ss]a ) resulting in a different curve in the mass - radius plane with a lower value of maximum mass ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ss]b ) .",
    "the figures also reveal the fact that if an eos is stiffer than another at a given temperature , then it will remain stiffer even at a different temperature . here",
    "we have used the stiffest ( eos a ) and the softest ( eos f ) eoss in our model ( bagchi @xmath5 2006 ) .",
    "the change in eos is due to a combined effect of the change of gluon mass and the quark distribution function ( fermi function ) with temperature , which also changes the number densities ( @xmath14 ) of the quarks . both the energy density and number density increases with temperature .",
    "but the increase in energy density is more dominant than that in number density ( see bagchi @xmath5 2006 for expressions of @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) .",
    "so energy per baryon increases with rising temperature - resulting in an increase of mass of the star for a fixed baryon number .",
    "we find a softening of the eos at a higher temperature , in contrast to other models showing the opposite behavior ( kettner @xmath5 1995 ) .",
    "moreover , all models consider the effect of temperature through fermi function but in addition to this , our model incorporates the temperature dependence of the interquark interaction .    in our model ,",
    "while establishing beta equilibrium conditions , we have assumed that neutrinos have escaped from the star .",
    "this is true in the low temperature regime .",
    "but at high temperatures like 50 - 80 mev , some of the neutrinos will be trapped inside the star which will affect the eos . but",
    "here for simplicity , we neglect this effect as our concern is the astrophysical processes in moderately low temperature where this assumption is valid .",
    ".maximum mass strange stars at different temperatures for eos f. [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tb : maxmass_isentropy ]",
    "in a core collapse supernova , people guess the possibility of production of either a neutron star or a strange star or a black hole .",
    "we model that first a neutron star is born during the supernova , which rapidly comes to a low temperature by neutrino cooling and then it converts to a strange star ( e.g. staff @xmath5 2006 ) .",
    "the intermediate neutron star stage may lead to a delay between a supernova and the subsequent strange star formation which has interesting implications to the model of grbs involving strange stars ( staff @xmath5 2007 ) .    here",
    "we should remember that our esos for sqm , which ignore neutrino effects , might not be appropriate at a very high temperature created by the supernova .",
    "but as we are modeling that first a neutron star is born during the supernova and then it converts to a strange star at a low temperature , the simplification in the eos does not affect the physics .",
    "the recent launch of swift satellite has revealed some new interesting features of the grb afterglows which can not be easily explained by current models . if a strange star form inside a collapsar then a new model involving a three step process in the framework of the `` quark nova '' scenario ( ouyed @xmath5 2002 ; kernen @xmath5 2005 ) is one possible way of explaining recent swift data . in this model ,",
    "the conversion of a neutron star to a strange star followed later by the conversion of the strange star to a black hole  as suggested in this paper  is involved . here",
    "grb occurs due to the jet from the accreting strange star ( ouyed @xmath5 2005 ) .",
    "depending on the initial mass , temperature and the accretion rate , a strange star may collapse to a black hole and the accretion onto the black hole gives rise to an ultra - relativistic jet causing the giant flares observed in some grb afterglows ( see staff @xmath5 2007 for details ) .",
    "in this paper we studied the effects of temperature on the eos of sqm .",
    "a novelty in our model is the increase of the softness of the eos at high temperatures .",
    "this feature reveals the dependence of the maximum allowable mass on the temperature and the change of the star s mass and radius with temperature .",
    "this suggests that the collapse of an ss to black hole is more intricate than previously thought and might have interesting astrophysical applications specifically in situations involving accreting ss with applications to grbs .",
    "we have also isolated a new type of radial oscillations that we termed _ chromo - thermal_. as the increase in mass is accompanied by the decrease in radius and vice versa , the value of gravitational redshift @xmath15 will also oscillate .",
    "this effect could in principle be detected through spectral or timing analysis techniques and should put our model to test .",
