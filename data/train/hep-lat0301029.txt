    "improvement and anisotropy are two key ingredients of the recent developments in lattice qcd . in qcd with dynamical quarks ,",
    "improvement of the lattice theory is essential to perform a continuum extrapolation of light hadron spectra within the computer power currently available @xcite . at finite temperatures , the expected o(4 ) scaling around the two - flavor chiral transition point is reproduced on the lattice only with improved wilson - type quarks @xcite .",
    "improved actions are applied also for staggered - type quarks to reduce lattice artifacts @xcite . however , in order to perform a continuum extrapolation of thermodynamic quantities , we need to further increase the temporal lattice size @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this requires quite large spatial lattice sizes to keep the system close to the thermodynamic limit , and the task slightly exceeds the current limit of the computer power for qcd with dynamical quarks @xcite .",
    "recently , we proposed to apply anisotropic lattices for reducing the computational demand in thermal qcd @xcite . because the dominant part of the lattice artifacts in the equation of state ( eos ) is due to the finite temporal cutoff , an anisotropic lattice with a larger temporal cutoff will provide us with an efficient way to calculate thermodynamic quantities .",
    "we tested the idea for the case of the su(3 ) gauge theory with the standard one - plaquette action . from a series of simulations at @xmath4 , 5 and 6 with the anisotropy @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the spatial and temporal lattice spacings , we find that the lattice artifacts in eos are much smaller than those on the corresponding isotropic lattice , and the leading scaling relation is satisfied from the coarsest lattice .",
    "this enabled us to perform a well - controlled continuum extrapolation of eos in qcd .",
    "anisotropic lattices have been employed also to study transport coefficients and temporal correlation functions in finite temperature qcd @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "anisotropy was introduced to obtain more data points for temporal correlation functions . at zero temperature ,",
    "anisotropic lattices have been employed to study charmonium states @xcite , heavy hybrids @xcite , glueballs @xcite , and also the pion scattering length @xcite .",
    "combination of the ideas of improvement and anisotropy is not straightforward , however .",
    "the main difficulty is the large number of coupling parameters in improved actions on anisotropic lattices .",
    "even in the simplest case of the renormalization - group ( rg ) improved gauge action by iwasaki @xcite , which contains plaquette and @xmath0 rectangular terms only , we have 5 parameters on anisotropic lattices , instead of 2 for the isotropic case .",
    "we have to fix them as functions of two parameters , the gauge coupling @xmath8 which controls the overall scale , and the anisotropy @xmath9 .",
    "because the redundant parameters have no physical effects in the continuum limit , they have to be determined through a requirement of improvement , i.e. minimizing lattice artifacts in physical observables away from the continuum limit .",
    "concrete form of the dependence on the scale and anisotropy in the coupling parameters is important for a calculation of thermodynamic quantities @xcite . in a symanzik - type improvement program ,",
    "it is easy to see that , at the tree level of perturbation theory , the coupling parameters are independent of @xmath9 .",
    "accordingly , studies of finite temperature symanzik - type improved actions on anisotropic lattices have been done assuming isotropic improvement parameters @xcite .",
    "when we improve the theory beyond the tree level , we have to take into account the @xmath9-dependences in the coupling parameters .",
    "isotropic parameters have been adopted also in a study of the rg - improved action on anisotropic lattices @xcite , however , without justifying the choice .    in this paper",
    ", we study the anisotropic improvement parameters for the rg - improved gauge action . following iwasaki s program of rg - improvement using a block spin transformation ,",
    "we determine the values of coupling parameters which minimize the lattice discretization errors . after a brief explanation of the rg - improved action in sec .",
    "[ sec : rg ] , the anisotropic gauge action we study is defined in sec .  [",
    "sec : action ] .",
    "we then study wilson loops under a block spin transformation in sec .",
    "[ sec : wilson ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : arg ] , rg - improved actions on anisotropic lattices are determined and a practical choice of the improved action for numerical simulations is discussed .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "various lattice actions are expected to belong to a common universality class having the same continuum limit . for the su(3 )",
    "gauge theory , a lattice action may contain , for example , @xmath0 rectangular loops , @xmath10 squares , etc .",
    ", in addition to the conventional plaquettes .",
    "one combination @xmath11 of the coupling parameters is the relevant parameter which reflects the freedom of the lattice spacing , while other coupling parameters are redundant in the continuum limit .",
    "the objective of improvement is to find the values of redundant parameters for which physical observables from a coarse lattice are closest to their continuum values .    in order to discuss the improvement of a lattice action",
    ", we consider rg flows of a block spin transformation as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rg ] .",
    "the block spin transformation halves the correlation length in lattice units but does not change the long - range properties of the system .",
    "then , the coupling parameter moves toward smaller @xmath8 corresponding to the correlation length becoming shorter . in this figure , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , etc .",
    "denote the redundant coupling parameters , and the points on the @xmath14 axis correspond to the standard one plaquette actions .",
    "the hyperplane at @xmath15 @xmath16 , on which the correlation length diverges and the continuum limit can be taken , is called the critical surface . in this surface",
    ", the coupling parameter does not go out of the surface of @xmath15 under the block spin transformation , since the correlation length after the block spin transformation is also infinity , which means that an rg flow around @xmath15 runs parallel to the critical surface , except in the vicinity of a fixed point ( fp ) , at which a coupling parameter does not change under the block spin transformation .",
    "therefore , an rg flow can connect only at fp to the critical surface .",
    "moreover , because rg flows can be regarded as lines of constant physics , the distance between each rg flow becomes wider as @xmath8 increases corresponding to physical quantities becoming more insensitive to the redundant coupling parameters , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , etc .",
    ", as the continuum limit is approached , and only one rg flow which has properties in the continuum limit , called the renormalized trajectory ( rt ) , can connect to the critical surface at fp by infinite block spin transformations .",
    "the actions on the rt are `` perfect actions '' which reproduce continuum properties from the shortest distances on the lattice @xcite .",
    "if an infinite number of coupling parameters are admitted , a perfect action is a goal of improvement . in reality , we are forced to keep the interactions as simple as possible in numerical simulations . hence to find the nearest point to rt in the restricted coupling parameter space is the problem in practice .",
    "iwasaki applied the program of improvement to the su(@xmath17 ) gauge theory in the weak coupling limit for the case of the action with plaquette and @xmath18 rectangular terms @xcite .",
    "he found the nearest point to the fixed point in the coupling parameter subspace by calculating wilson loops perturbatively on the lattice consisting of blocked link valuables after block spin transformations .",
    "another approach of an rg - improved action is the classical perfect action approach in @xcite , which is suitable for increasing the coupling parameters .",
    "see @xcite for a trial to include quantum corrections .",
    "a classically perfect action on anisotropic lattices was studied in @xcite .",
    "on isotropic lattices , the rg - improved gauge action by iwasaki @xcite , which consists of plaquettes @xmath19 and @xmath0 rectangular loops @xmath20 , is defined by s_imp = -\\ { _ x , > c_0 w_^(1",

    "this action has been shown to lead to better rotation symmetry of heavy quark potential than the standard one plaquette action @xcite , and to suppress lattice artifacts associated with wilson - type quarks at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "this action was also reported to be efficient in suppressing chiral violations in domain - wall quarks @xcite . in two - flavor full qcd with clover - improved wilson quarks , the first systematic studies of the light hadron spectrum @xcite and the finite temperature equation of state with wilson - type quarks @xcite have been carried out .",

    "we search for an action which reproduces the values of wilson loops in the @xmath74 limit as much as possible within the restricted coupling parameter space of the action , eq.([eq : gaction ] ) .",
    "for this purpose , iwasaki considered the average relative deviation of wilson loops , @xmath86 where @xmath87 is over 4 loop shapes up to length 6  plaquette ( [ eq : plaq ] ) , @xmath0 rectangular loop ( [ eq : rect ] ) , chair ( [ eq : chair ] ) , and 3-dimensional loop ( [ eq:3dim ] )  with a uniform weight @xmath88 .",
    "eq.([eq : r ] ) means that , when @xmath89 , for example , the deviation of small wilson loops from their values in the @xmath74 limit is about 1% after @xmath61 block spin transformations . on anisotropic lattices ,",
    "we generalize eq.([eq : r ] ) by subdividing each loop shape into orientations and adopt a uniform weight for each orientation .",
    "namely , because we have 3 spatial and 3 temporal plaquette orientations , we give @xmath90 . for @xmath0",
    "rectangular loops , we have 6 orientations of spatial loops , 3 orientations of @xmath91 , and 3 orientations of @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , we give 1/8 , 1/16 , and 1/16 for their weights .",
    "similarly , we subdivide 12 chair and 4 3-dimensional loop orientations .    here , we should emphasize that we are trying to reproduce the values of @xmath93 for 10 different wilson loops by controlling 3 coupling parameters for @xmath94 ( 4 wilson loops by 1 parameter for @xmath95 ) at the same time , which is a quite non - trivial trial , and the value of @xmath96 indicates that @xmath97 does not change within the accuracy of @xmath96 under block spin transformations , since @xmath97 approaches to @xmath93 as @xmath61 increases and the change of @xmath97 is smaller than the difference .",
    "therefore , by measuring the indicator @xmath96 , we can check indirectly how `` slowly '' the coupling parameters flow , i.e. how the nearest point which we find in the restricted parameter space is close to the real fixed point in the weak coupling limit .    in fig .",

    "<S> we study a block spin transformation in the su(3 ) lattice gauge theory on anisotropic lattices to obtain iwasaki s renormalization group improved action for anisotropic cases . for the class of actions with plaquette and @xmath0 rectangular terms </S>",
    "<S> , we determine the improvement parameters as functions of the anisotropy @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the program of improvement works well also on anisotropic lattices . from a study of an indicator which estimates the distance to the renormalized trajectory , </S>",
    "<S> we show that , for the range of the anisotropy @xmath24 , the coupling parameters previously determined for isotropic lattices improve the theory considerably . </S>"
