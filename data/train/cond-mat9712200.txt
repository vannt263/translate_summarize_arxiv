    "among the collective phenomena that are currently attracting the interest of the scientific community one of the most relevant concerns the synchronization of the temporal activity of populations of interacting nonlinear oscillators , due to its ubiquity in many different fields of science .",
    "experimental evidences of this phenomenon have been reported for centuries @xcite but in the last decades the advance in the comprehension of its nature has allowed to develop a theoretical description . in this context , several successful ideas has been suggested .",
    "an interesting approach proposed in @xcite has been shown to be useful to describe the dynamic evolution of the population .",
    "the idea consist in modeling the system as an assembly of phase oscillators interacting through continuous - time couplings . for sufficiently large coupling strength",
    "the system may undergo a phase transition from incoherence to spontaneous mutual synchronization .",
    "more challenging from a theoretical and realistic point of view is to consider networks of pulse - coupled oscillators which may account for the behavior of heart pacemaker cells , integrate and fire neurons , and other systems made of excitable units .",
    "the intrinsic nonlinearities associated to these models make their dynamical evolution more difficult to describe and only in the last years real advances have occurred @xcite .    up to now",
    ", almost all the theoretical approaches have been centered around mean - field models or populations of just a few oscillators . from these studies it is possible to investigate the mechanisms relevant for the formation of assemblies of synchronized elements as well as other spatio - temporal structures .",
    "however , these mean - field descriptions are , in many cases , far from reality and other methods where the specific topology or geometry of the system , as well as the precise connectivity between units , must be considered because their effects may be crucial . in a such new world many points remain open . in particular",
    "the majority of works rely on simulations showing the outstanding richness that a low dimensional system of pulse - coupled oscillators may display .",
    "some examples are self - organized criticality , chaos , quasiperiodicity , etc . @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , a rigorous mathematical description of these systems is still missing .",
    "some of the theoretical papers appeared in the scientific literature proof the stability of some behaviors @xcite but they do not explore the mechanisms leading to them .",
    "the goal of this paper goes in both directions : the analysis of the mechanisms which are responsible for synchronization and formation of spatio - temporal structures , and , as a complement , to proof under which conditions they are stable solutions of the dynamical equations .",
    "since our motivation is to analyze the essence of the problem we have considered a 1d model which will allow us to illustrate the ideas in a very clear way . in spite of this apparent simplicity , this system displays a rich set of behaviors , that depend on the specific values of the parameters of the model , which has been observed in lattices with higher coordination numbers.@xcite notice that populations of 1d pulse coupled oscillators are currently of great interest in some areas of science . as an example",
    "let us mention that for a certain type of cardiac arrhythmia there is an abnormally rapid heartbeat whose period is set by the time that an excitation takes to travel a circuit .",
    "this observation can be explained by modeling appropriately the circulation of a wave of excitation on a one - dimensional ring @xcite . in a different context ,",
    "synchronization and periodic states of 1d populations of phase - locked loops have been recently investigated.@xcite    the structure of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the system as well as the notation used throughout the paper .",
    "sections iii and iv are devoted to analyze the simplest cases of three and four oscillators , respectively . in sec .",
    "v we study the general case , whereas in the last section we present our conclusions .",
    "let us consider a system formed by a population of @xmath0 oscillators distributed on a ring .",
    "the state of each oscillator is described by its phase which increases linearly in time , until one of them reaches a threshold value that , without loss of generality , we have considered equal to @xmath1 . when this happens the oscillator fires and changes the state of its rightmost neighbor according to @xmath2 @xmath3 subjected to periodic boundary conditions , i.e. @xmath4 , and where @xmath5 denotes the strength of the coupling . from an effective point of view",
    ", the pulse - interaction between oscillators , as well as the state of each unit of the system , can be described in terms of changes in the phase , or in other words , in terms of the so called phase response curve ( prc ) , @xmath6 in our case . behind this fact",
    "one assumes that the phase shift elicited by an impulse affects the period of a given unit in the current time interval but not in future intervals . in this paper",
    "we have also considered a linear prc @xcite . in practise , however , this condition can be relaxed since a nonlinear prc does not change the qualitative behavior of the model provided the number of fixed points of the dynamics is not altered . moreover , a linear prc has the advantage of making the system tractable from an analytical point of view .",
    "let us describe the notation used in the paper .",
    "the population is ordered according to the following criterion : the oscillator which fires will be always labeled as unit 0 and the rest of the population will be ordered from this unit clockwise . after the firing , the system is driven until another oscillator reaches the threshold .",
    "then , we relabel the units such that the oscillator at @xmath7 is now unit number 0 , and so on .",
    "the whole process can be described through a suitable transformation .",
    "this fact will enable us to study the origin of different structures in a very simple way .",
    "our strategy has been to trace the phases of the oscillators after each firing and then to construct return maps either of a complete cycle , in which all the oscillators fire exactly once , or after a single firing + driving process ( fd ) .",
    "let us clarify this point mathematically .",
    "the first step is to construct the matrix of the transformation for a fd .",
    "to illustrate the situation let us consider the general transformation for a jump @xmath8 between two successive firings , distinguishing between @xmath9    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]",
    "in order to analyze the mechanisms of synchronization and the formation of spatio - temporal structures we have introduced a very simple model of pulse - coupled oscillators : a one - dimensional ring with unidirectional coupling . despite this apparent simplicity",
    "it conserves all the features of low - dimensional systems subjected to short - range interactions which develop large - scale structures .",
    "although the dynamic evolution of the system involves two time scales , a slow one for the driving and a fast one for the interaction , we have constructed return maps that gives a complete information of the system . concerning the maps , we have been able to compute exactly the fixed points of the dynamical evolution and their stability .    for a negative ( inhibitory ) coupling the fixed points are attractors of the dynamics",
    "each one of these attractors has a well defined basin of attraction , although in some cases those regions are not simply connected . since the evolution is discrete there are jumps among non - connected regions that correspond to advancements between oscillators .",
    "the advancements are only important in the transient dynamics , until the phases of the oscillators lie in the final basin of attraction of the fixed point .",
    "the volumes of the basins of attraction are different and depend on the value of the coupling , as we have checked by means of computer simulations of a few oscillators .",
    "however , the states with the maximum phase difference between neighboring oscillators seems to be the preferred ones .    on the other hand , for a positive ( excitatory ) coupling the fixed points",
    "are repellers of the dynamical evolution .",
    "although in a configuration space with a multiplicity of repellers one can think that the system will jump from one region to another this is not our case .",
    "there are absorbing barriers surrounding the repellers ; when the system reaches one of these barriers it means that at least two neighboring oscillators have synchronized . when this happens the set of synchronized oscillators acts as a single unit that can not be broken . from that time on we only need to consider a reduced number of units ; we call this fact dimensional reduction since the new system can be described in terms of matrices with less components .",
    "this process of absorption is iterated until the system reaches a completely synchronized configuration .",
    "the present work only concerns the qualitative behavior of a population of pulse - coupled oscillators ; nevertheless , a quantitative behavior about the time a given population needs to reach the stationary state , either a synchronized one or a spatio - temporal pattern , would be desirable in order to complete the description of such systems .",
    "another interesting question is related to the stability of the different structures with respect to fluctuations .        in this appendix",
    "we will compute the bounds of the eigenvalues of the matrices @xmath10 defined in eqs .",
    "( 2)-(3 ) .",
    "all the information will be extracted form the characteristic polynomial @xmath11 which corresponds to the determinant @xmath12 . in this case",
    "we will distinguish several situations .",
    "first of all when @xmath13 and @xmath8 have common factors it is easy to see in the determinant that always exists a minor that corresponds to eigenvalues of modulus 1 ; anyway , as we explain in the text we do not need to care about this case .",
    "@xmath20 with this procedure we have converted a , in principle , complex matrix in a much simpler one .",
    "the new matrix has @xmath21 in the last column and @xmath22 s just below the main diagonal , unless at column @xmath23 and row @xmath24 where it has @xmath25 . in order to compute the eigenvalues",
    "we should notice that when @xmath26 the characteristic polynomial is @xmath27 then to compute it for @xmath28 we expand the determinant around the previous case and one realizes that the columns that are at the right and the rows that are below this element will not contribute .",
    "thus one has @xmath29",
    "@xmath30 the last expression can be taken as general , i.e. including the @xmath9 case , bearing in mind that @xmath31 .",
    "it is obvious that to compute the roots of ( [ pnn ] ) is an unnecessary task , since the only needed information concerning the stability are the bounds of the eigenvalues . in order to compute these bounds",
    "we will look at the properties of the characteristic polynomial .",
    "it can be rewritten as      then the eigenvalues of the matrix will correspond to the roots of @xmath33 unless the artificially introduced @xmath34 .",
    "these roots will verify @xmath35 this modulus has upper and lower bounds given by the sum and the difference , i.e. @xmath36 , we use @xmath37 which implies that @xmath38 .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath39 we take @xmath40 which , in turn , implies that @xmath41 .",
    "the final point is to show that the equality can only be fulfilled when both complex numbers have the same direction .",
    "it is easy to see that this can only happen when @xmath13 and @xmath23 have common factors .",
    "since this fact is avoided in this demostration we are left with the fact that for an excitatory coupling ( @xmath42 ) the eigenvalues are larger than 1 and the opposite for an inhibitory coupling ( @xmath43 ) , as we wanted to show .",
    "this assumption has physical sense in some situations .",
    "for instance , for the peskin model of pacemaker cardiac cells @xcite one can expand the prc @xcite in powers of the convexity of the driving , leading to a prc with a constant term , whose only effect is to shift the threshold , plus another term which is proportional to the phase ."
