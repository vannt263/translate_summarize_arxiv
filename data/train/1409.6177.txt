    "the study of the qcd phase diagram , when matter is subject to strong external magnetic fields has been a topic of intense investigation recently . the fact that magnetic fields can reach intensities of the order of @xmath0 g or higher in heavy - ion collisions @xcite and up to @xmath1 g in the center of magnetars @xcite made theoretical physicists consider matter subject to magnetic field both at high temperatures and low densities and low temperatures and high densities .    in this work",
    "we study the above mentioned situations within the framework of the nambu  jona - lasinio model with polyakov loop ( pnjl ) and different versions of the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite for two commonly used parameter sets , known as hk @xcite and rkh @xcite .",
    "we describe quark matter subject to strong magnetic fields within the su(3 ) pnjl model with vector interaction and the lagrangian density reads : @xmath2 \\psi_f ~+~ { \\cal l}_{sym}~+~{\\cal l}_{det } \\nonumber\\\\ & + & { \\cal l}_{vec }   + { \\mathcal{u } } \\left(\\phi,\\bar\\phi;t\\right ) - \\frac{1}{4}f_{\\mu \\nu}f^{\\mu \\nu } ,      \\label{pnjl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath3 , \\\\     { \\cal l}_{det}&=&-k\\left\\{{\\rm det}_f \\left [ { \\bar \\psi}_f(1+\\gamma_5)\\psi_f \\right ] +      { \\rm det}_f\\left [ { \\bar \\psi}_f(1-\\gamma_5)\\psi_f\\right ] \\right \\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 represents a quark field with three flavors , @xmath5 is the corresponding ( current ) mass matrix , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the unit matrix in the three flavor space , and @xmath8 denote the gell - mann matrices .",
    "the coupling between the magnetic field @xmath9 and quarks , and between the effective gluon field and quarks is implemented _ via _ the covariant derivative @xmath10 where @xmath11 represents the quark electric charge , @xmath12 is a static and constant magnetic field in the @xmath13 direction and @xmath14 . to describe the pure gauge sector an effective potential @xmath15",
    "is chosen : @xmath16 ,      \\label{ueff}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "the standard choice of the parameters for the effective potential @xmath19 is @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .    as for the vector interaction , the lagrangian density that denotes",
    "the @xmath24 invariant interaction is @xmath25 ,   \\label{p1}\\ ] ] and a reduced lagrangian density can be written as @xmath26    at zero temperature the pnjl model reduces to the normal njl model .    in the su(3 ) models , the above lagrangian densities for the vector sector are not identical in a mean field approach and we discuss both cases next .",
    "we refer to the lagrangian density given in eq .",
    "( [ p1 ] ) as model 1 ( p1 ) and to the lagrangian density given in eq .",
    "( [ p2 ] ) as model 2 ( p2 ) .    for our calculations ,",
    "we need to evaluate the thermodynamical potential for the three flavor quark sector , @xmath27 where @xmath28 represents the pressure , @xmath29 the energy density , @xmath30 the temperature , @xmath31 the entropy density , and @xmath32 the chemical potential of quark with flavor @xmath33 . to determine the eos for the su(3 ) njl at finite density and in the presence of a magnetic field in a mean field approximation we need to know the scalar condensates , @xmath34 , the quark number densities , @xmath35 , as well as the pressure kinetic contribution from the gas of quasi - particles , @xmath36 . in the presence of a magnetic field",
    "all these quantities have been evaluated with great detail in @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we move next to finite temperature and study the location of the critical end point ( cep ) on the qcd phase diagram within the framework of the pnjl model and without the introduction of the vector interaction .",
    "we investigate different scenarios with respect to the isospin and strangeness content of matter , as shown in figure [ fig5 ] left for non - magnetized matter . for matter in @xmath38-equilibrium ,",
    "the cep occurs at smaller temperatures and densities .",
    "this scenario is of interest for neutron stars and confirms previous calculations that indicate that a deconfinement phase transition in the laboratory will be more easily attained with asymmetric nuclear matter @xcite .    as a matter of fact , by taking @xmath39 and increasing systematically @xmath40 with respect to @xmath41 the cep moves to smaller temperatures and larger baryonic chemical potentials @xcite : less symmetric matter is less bound and , therefore , the transition to a chirally symmetric phase occurs at a smaller temperature and density than in the symmetric case ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "when the asymmetry is large enough , @xmath43 , the cep disappears .",
    "another interesting situation is observed when analyzing very isospin asymmetric matter subject to different intensities of the magnetic field , as seen in figure [ fig5 ] right .",
    "starting from a scenario having an isospin asymmetry above which the cep does not exist for a zero external magnetic field ( @xmath44 ) it was shown the introduction of an external magnetic field could drive the system to a first order phase transition .",
    "the cep occurs at very small temperatures if @xmath45 gev@xmath46 and , in this case , a complicated structure with several cep at different values of ( @xmath47 are possible for the same magnetic field , because the temperature is not high enough to wash out the landau level effects .",
    "indeed , the magnetic field affects in a different way @xmath48 and @xmath49 quarks due to their different electric charge .",
    "a consequence is the possible appearance of two or more ceps for a given magnetic field intensity . for @xmath50 gev@xmath46",
    "only one cep exists .",
    "this is an important result because it shows that an external magnetic field is able to drive a system with no cep into a first order phase transition @xcite .    in the right panel of figure [ fig5 ]",
    "we present the results for two other scenarios where a first order phase transition already occurs at zero magnetic field : @xmath42 and @xmath51 . for moderate magnetic fields",
    "the trend is very similar for all scenarios : as the intensity of the magnetic field increases , the transition temperature increases and the baryonic chemical potential decreases until the critical value @xmath52 gev@xmath46 . for stronger magnetic fields both @xmath30 and @xmath53 increase .",
    "it is also important to point out that all three scenarios presented in the right panel of figure [ fig5 ] show an inverse magnetic catalysis at finite chemical potential and zero temperature , i.e. , the critical temperature decreases with increasing @xmath54 . for large values of @xmath54",
    "this inverse magnetic catalysis tendency disappears and a magnetic catalysis takes place .",
