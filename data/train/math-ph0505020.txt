    "in this article , methods of classical analysis are employed to obtain the exact solution for the green s function describing the spectrum of radiation emitted by an x - ray pulsar . beyond the direct physical relevance of the green s function , the method of solution also yields several additional results of mathematical interest , including a new summation formula involving products of two hypergeometric functions , as well as new linear and bilinear generating functions for the jacobi polynomials .",
    "we also obtain an exact expression for the quadratic normalization integrals of the orthogonal hypergeometric eigenfunctions . before proceeding with the main derivation",
    ", some physical background is called for .",
    "the radiation produced in bright x - ray pulsars is powered by the gravitational accretion ( inflow ) of ionized gas that is channeled onto the poles of a rotating neutron star by the strong magnetic field . in these sources , the radiation pressure greatly exceeds the gas pressure , and therefore the pressure of the photons governs the dynamical structure of the accretion flow .",
    "it follows that the gas must pass through a radiation - dominated shock on its way to the stellar surface , and the kinetic energy of the gas is carried away by the high - energy radiation that escapes from the column.@xmath0 the strong gradient of the radiation pressure decelerates the material to rest at the surface of the star , and the compression of the infalling gas drives its temperatures up to a few million kelvins .",
    "the gas therefore radiates x - rays , which appear to pulsate due to the star s spin .",
    "however , the observed x - ray spectrum is nonthermal , indicating that nonequilibrium processes are playing an important role in the formation of the radiation distribution .",
    "the nonthermal shape of the spectrum is primarily due to the flow compression , which causes fermi energization of the photons as they collide with infalling electrons in the column , until the radiation escapes from the column into space .",
    "our primary goal in this article is to obtain an exact solution for the green s function describing the upscattering of soft , monoenergetic photons injected by a source located in the base of the accretion column , near the surface of the star .",
    "the green s function contains a complete representation of the fundamental physics governing the propagation of the photons in the physical and energy spaces . since the transport equation governing the radiation distribution is linear , we can compute the solution associated with an arbitrary source distribution via convolution .",
    "hence the green s function provides the most direct means for exploring the relationship between the physics occurring in the accretion shock and the production of the observed nonthermal x - radiation .",
    "we assume that the accretion column is cylindrical , and we define @xmath1 as the spatial coordinate measured along the column axis .",
    "the gas flows through the column onto the stellar surface with velocity @xmath2 .",
    "we define the green s function , @xmath3 , as the radiation distribution at location @xmath1 and energy @xmath4 resulting from the injection of @xmath5 photons per second with energy @xmath6 from a monochromatic source at location @xmath7 inside the column . in a steady - state situation",

    ", the first - order fermi energization corresponds to the @xmath18 work done on the radiation by the compression of the background plasma as it accretes onto the stellar surface.@xmath19 the dimensionless constant @xmath20 expresses the strength of the absorption ( if any ) occurring at the source location , and the mean escape time is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the electron scattering cross section for photons propagating perpendicular to the column axis .",
    "in general , @xmath23 due to the influence of the strong magnetic field , which is directed parallel to the axis of the column .",
    "absorption at the source location is expected if the photons are produced in a blackbody `` mound '' of dense gas near the base of the accretion column,@xmath0 because a perfect blackbody acts as both a source and a sink of radiation.@xmath24    the flux of electrons flowing down the column is denoted by @xmath25 . in our cylindrical , steady - state problem , @xmath26 maintains a constant value .",

    "further simplification is possible if we work in terms of the new spatial variable @xmath40 , defined by @xmath41 note that @xmath42 in the far upstream region ( @xmath43 ) , and @xmath44 at the surface of the star ( @xmath45 )",

    "we also observe that if we increase the absorption parameter @xmath20 while holding @xmath50 fixed , then @xmath126 increases monotonically , and therefore the high - energy spectrum becomes progressively steeper .",
