    "to develop an improved understanding of star formation it is very useful to empirically map variations of the binary - star properties and the initial mass function with environment , such as metallicity , density and temperature of the star - forming cloud .",
    "however , a naive interpretation of observational data may result in misleading conclusions .",
    "for instance , a comparison of binary proportions in different stellar populations , without taking into account the dynamical history of the population , is ill - fated , because the distribution of orbital elements of a population carries a memory of the dynamical history ( kroupa 1998 ) .",
    "one purpose of this paper is to further illustrate , on the one hand this danger , and on the other hand , the richness in understanding that can be gained through stellar - dynamical studies of young stellar systems .",
    "the trapezium cluster in the orion star forming region is a young , populous stellar cluster , which contains a negligible amount ( @xmath0 ) of residual gas ( wilson et al .",
    "1997 ; odell 1999 , private communication ) and for which a large amount of observational data has been collected over decades .",
    "thus , it is an excellent target for investigating the early dynamical evolution of a young cluster with a primordial binary proportion at least as large as in the galactic field .",
    "the cluster s age is estimated to be younger than 5  myr ( prosser et al .",
    "1994 ; hillenbrand 1997 ) , and probably @xmath1  yr . the central stellar number density is very high , with the mean inter - stellar separation being about 6000  au ( mccaughrean & stauffer 1994 ) . the trapezium cluster is a well - suited sample for the study of star formation in a dense stellar environment , as opposed to the low - density young stellar groups in the taurus - auriga star forming region ( gomez et al .",
    "1993 ; briceno et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "variations in stellar properties may occur with star formation environment .",
    "for example , the observed pre - main sequence binary population in the trapezium cluster is significantly different than in taurus - auriga . in the latter approximately all stars are in binary systems ( khler & leinert 1998 ; duchene 1999 ; ghez et al .",
    "1997 ) , while in the trapezium cluster the binary proportion is significantly lower ( prosser et al . 1994 ; petr 1998 ; petr et al . 1998 ; but see also padgett , strom & ghez 1997 ) , being comparable to what is found in the galactic field ( duquennoy & mayor 1991 ) .",
    "this , however , does not necessarily imply that most galactic field stars stem from trapezium - cluster type assemblages , there being evidence that the proportion of long - period binary systems is significantly below the galactic field value ( scally , clarke & mccaughrean , 1999 ) . the binary population may well decrease further in the trapezium cluster , if it is a bound entity . and",
    "it may have been higher at birth .",
    "a stellar system with a half - mass radius of @xmath2  pc , containing @xmath3 stars , with a mass @xmath4 , has a relaxation time @xmath5  myr , which is the time - scale over which the cluster looses memory of its initial conditions",
    ". these are characteristic observed values for the trapezium cluster .",
    "the three - dimensional velocity dispersion in the trapezium cluster is @xmath6  km / s , the crossing time being @xmath7  yr ( an overview of the dynamical evolution of young clusters can be found in bonnell & kroupa 1999 ) .",
    "a typical star may thus have crossed the central region many times , given that the age of the cluster is @xmath8  myr .",
    "this implies that collisions between stellar systems will have been frequent .",
    "it also implies that the birth structure of the cluster will have been eradicated .",
    "indications that this may be the case comes from the apparent lack of sub - structure ( bate , clarke & mccaughrean 1998 )",
    ".    the trapezium cluster may thus be just old enough to perhaps have allowed an initial taurus - auriga binary population to have dynamically evolved to the observed reduced value .",
    "alternatively , it may well be true that the lower binary proportion of the trapezium cluster as compared to the taurus - auriga star forming region is due to different star - forming conditions .",
    "durisen & sterzik ( 1994 ) point out that binary formation from fragmentation of collapsing and rotating clouds , or from a gravitational instability of massive proto - stellar disks , is more likely in low - temperature clouds .",
    "that the binary proportion is eroded efficiently in a dense cluster has been shown by kroupa ( 1995a ) . however , whether the observed difference between the trapezium cluster and taurus - auriga can be explained with this mechanism must be investigated by constructing self - consistent models , that more closely match the properties of the trapezium cluster .",
    "if such a study shows that encounters are not efficient enough for a wide variety of models of the trapezium cluster , then the conclusion must be that the binary proportion depends on star - forming conditions .",
    "the aim of this paper is to begin tackling this problem by comparing evolving model populations with the constraints given by observations .    in this paper",
    "we present the first steps towards more realistic fully self - consistent models of embedded clusters in general , and of the trapezium cluster in particular .",
    "section  [ sec : obs ] summarises the available observational constraints and section  [ sec : models ] details the model assumptions . in section",
    "[ sec : code ] we explain the calculation and data - evaluation programmes .",
    "the results are presented in section  [ sec : res ] , and sections  [ sec : disc ] and  [ sec : conc ] contain the discussion and conclusions , respectively . an accompanying paper ( kroupa 1999 )",
    "generalises these results to different numbers of stars and cluster radii , with a view to discussing the dynamical state of the orion nebula cluster and the set of viable initial conditions .",
    "the aim of this investigation is to study the evolution of those observables that allow the dynamical state of a young cluster and its birth configuration to be constrained .",
    "such observables are the velocity dispersion , the central stellar volume number density and the radial dependence of the binary proportion .      in an optical high - resolution study carried out with the hubble space telescope ,",
    "319 stars in a region with size @xmath9 were identified ( prosser et al . 1994 ) . in a near infrared study covering a field of @xmath10 ( @xmath11 )",
    "centred on the trapezium cluster , mccaughrean et al .",
    "( 1996 ) counted 700 systems ( we call a single as well as a binary star a system ) .",
    "binary stars with separations below the 0.7  arcsec seeing limit were not resolved .",
    "this corresponds to a resolution limit of @xmath12  au , or log@xmath13 , where @xmath14 is in days , for a system with a mass of @xmath15 .    a high - spatial - resolution direct - imaging near - infrared study revealed even more stars in the innermost centre of the trapezium cluster ( mccaughrean & stauffer 1994 ) , and a remarkably high stellar density of @xmath16 stars per pc@xmath17 was estimated .",
    "mccaughrean & stauffer ( 1994 ) calculated that 29  systems are within the central spherical volume with a radius of @xmath18  pc .    from the analysis of the hr - diagram , based on optical photometry and spectroscopy , hillenbrand ( 1997 ) derived a mean age for the whole orion nebula cluster less than 1  myr , with an age spread of a few  myr .",
    "the age determination given by prosser et al .",
    "( 1994 ) is limited to the stars associated with the trapezium cluster and led to a medium age of @xmath19  yr , with nearly no detectable age spread .",
    "the projected one - dimensional velocity dispersion in the observational plane , within @xmath21  pc of the centre of the trapezium cluster , was derived by jones & walker ( 1988 ) to be @xmath22  km / s from their proper - motion survey using photographic plates .",
    "the data indicate no anisotropy , but these authors , van altena et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and tian et al .",
    "( 1996 ) note that the plate - reduction algorithms eliminate any signature due to rotation and/or expansion or contraction .",
    "thus , it is presently unknown if the trapezium cluster is expanding or contracting .",
    "the analysis of new absolute proper motions of a few dozen stars in the inner region ( @xmath23  pc ) of the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) , of which the trapezium cluster is likely to be merely the central part , however , suggests that there may be some expanding motion ( frink , kroupa & rser 1999 ) . for the present analysis",
    "we adopt the velocity dispersion obtained from the more precise relative proper motions , which we take to be corrected for radial bulk motions .",
    "photographic plates have a spatial resolution of typically 2  arcsec , which corresponds to about 1000  au in the trapezium cluster .",
    "most binary systems are therefore not resolved in these surveys .",
    "observations using the speckle holography technique in the core of the trapezium cluster by petr et al .",
    "( 1998 ) resolve binary systems with separations in the range @xmath24  au to @xmath25  au . of the 42 systems",
    "that appear projected within the central radius , @xmath26  pc , six are ob stars and four are binary systems within the studied range of separations .",
    "the apparent binary proportion of the entire sample is @xmath27 ( equation  [ eqn : binfapp ] below ) , and the binary proportion for low - mass ( @xmath28 ) stars is @xmath29 .",
    "the subscript `` app '' means that the observed @xmath30 is the apparent binary proportion that an observer deduces from projected star positions within some range of separations to which the observational apparatus is sensitive .",
    "the binary proportion of low - mass stars within the central radius @xmath31  pc is found by prosser et al .",
    "( 1994 ) using hst imaging to be @xmath32 in the separation range @xmath33  au to  @xmath34  au . the orbital periods corresponding to the respective separations are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : fappa ] .",
    "both studies thus find a binary proportion , in the respective distance ranges sampled , that is similar to the galactic field value , implying no measurable radial dependence of @xmath30 for @xmath35  pc ( for details see prosser et al .",
    "1994 , and petr et al .",
    "in this section we construct the model clusters .",
    "the appearance of the trapezium cluster today does not reflect the initial conditions when the stars decoupled dynamically from the gas , because the velocity dispersion of 2.5  pc / myr implies significant mixing or spreading within 0.51  myr .",
    "we therefore realize a variety of initial dynamical states . these cover models in cold collapse through initially virialised systems to clusters that expand .",
    "the following parameters are chosen to specify possible different model trapezium clusters at `` birth '' , i.e. at the time when stellar dynamics starts dominating over gas dynamics :    * @xmath36 stars ( point masses ) ; -1 mm * the initial mass function ( imf ) deduced from a careful analysis of star - count data in the galactic field ( kroupa , tout & gilmore 1993 ) with power - law index @xmath37 for @xmath38 ; this imf is based on scalo s ( 1986 ) imf for stars with @xmath39 ; -1 mm * lower and upper stellar mass limits of @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively ; -1 mm * a plummer density distribution ( aarseth , henon & wielen 1974 ) ; -1 mm * the initial position and velocity vectors of the binary - star centre - of - masses and single stars are independent of stellar mass ; -1 mm * the velocity distribution of the binary centre - of - masses and single stars is isotropic .",
    "models in virial equilibrium ( a1 , a2 ) , expanding models ( b1 , b2 ) and two cases of a cold collapse ( models  c1 and  c2 ) are computed . details of the models are given in table  [ table : models ] , the entries of which are described below and in the following sub - sections .",
    "the resulting cluster mass is @xmath42 .",
    "the models contain no gas mass .",
    "this is a safe assumption because wilson et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and c.r .",
    "odell ( private communication ) estimate the mass of gas to be only a few @xmath43 in the trapezium cluster .",
    "the choice of the initial number of stars is guided by the evidence presented in section  [ sec : numb_age ] , remembering that not all trapezium cluster stars will have been detected , as binary systems are usually not resolved in lower spatial resolution imaging studies .",
    "a binary proportion of  60  per  cent implies @xmath44 stars .",
    "however , we choose @xmath45 since rapid reduction of the number of systems in the observed area ( @xmath46  pc@xmath47 ) is to be expected owing to expansion of the cluster and ejection of stars .",
    "severe computational complications are avoided by assuming the stars have no extent . the assumption that the velocity and position vectors",
    "are not correlated with the stellar mass contradicts the observations , which show that the massive stars are concentrated in the cluster core .",
    "however , the present assumption allows investigation of whether dynamical mass - segregation in young binary - rich clusters can lead to the observed mass - segregation on time - scales of 1  myr or less .",
    "this will be the subject of another paper .",
    "the initial placement of the massive stars in the present models is also consistent with the empirical finding that ultra - compact hii regions in areas of rich and active star formation are usually distributed throughout the region over spatial scales of about 1  pc ( e.g. megeath et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the initial half - mass radius , @xmath48 , is listed in column  2 of table  [ table : models ] . for models  a1",
    "to  b2 it is based on the results of mccaughrean & stauffer ( 1994 ) .",
    "columns  3 and  4 list , respectively , the number of systems and stars within the central radius @xmath18  pc , and the central density ( @xmath49 $ ] , where @xmath50 is the plummer radius ) is given in column  5 .",
    "the parameters for models  a1 and  a2 are a compromise in that they give a central density that is larger by an order of magnitude than the observed value , and a velocity dispersion that is somewhat smaller than the observed value for virial equilibrium .",
    "the central density corresponds to an inter - system spacing of  2200  au . in this case , the initial model median relaxation and half - mass diameter crossing times are @xmath51  myr and @xmath52  myr , respectively .",
    "the central number density decreases and the half - mass radius increases within about @xmath53  yr owing to mass segregation and associated expansion , and heating through binary stars . the precise evolution can not be anticipated though , because it is not possible to easily estimate the various channels of energy exchange that exist in such a complex gravitational system , and since such realistic computations have never been been performed heretofore .",
    "column  6 of table  [ table : models ] contains the initial virial ratio , @xmath54 , where the nominator and denominator are , respectively , the total kinetic and potential energy of the whole cluster ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the cluster mass , @xmath58 is the three - dimensional velocity dispersion , @xmath59 is a characteristic cluster radius , and @xmath60 is the gravitational constant ) .",
    "one possible state is virial equilibrium , @xmath61 .",
    "however , the cluster may be expanding or contracting ( see section  [ sec : veld ] ) . to cover such possibilities , cluster models in virial equilibrium , expanding ( @xmath62 ) and cold collapse ( @xmath63 ) are studied .    if the total cluster mass before mass loss is @xmath64 , and if the cluster is initially in virial equilibrium , then for a sudden mass loss of amount @xmath65 , the new @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the star - formation efficiency . assuming the cluster instantly looses a mass @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) , @xmath62 , and the velocities are larger by a factor of @xmath70 than in a cluster in virial equilibrium with a mass @xmath71 .",
    "thus , in the case of the expanding models ( b1 , b2 ) , the initial velocities are increased by a factor of  1.55 .",
    "these models assume that the massive stars have driven out a gas mass , @xmath72 , immediately after they `` turn on '' , which is the time when the stellar - dynamical computation begins ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "this mass loss corresponds to a rather high star - formation efficiency of  42 per  cent , which is nevertheless expected to lead to an expanding , unbound association ( lada , margulis & dearborn 1984 ) .",
    "it is also in - line with the masses of outflows observed around young ob stars which have short ( @xmath74  yr ) durations ( churchwell 1997 ) . in such models",
    "it is possible that most of the cluster existed in an embedded phase for a few @xmath75  yr before the hypothetical gas expulsion event .",
    "this phase , however , is not modelled here .",
    "models  c1 and  c2 are clusters which undergo cold collapse from two different initial @xmath48 . to achieve this ,",
    "the initial velocities of all binary centre - of - masses and single stars are multiplied by a factor @xmath76 ( zero initial velocities are problematical for the n - body programme and would also be unrealistic since some clump  clump motions will always be present in the proto - cluster ) .",
    "such models are interesting because dynamical friction on dense gas clumps moving in an extended gas medium is expected to lead to the contraction of a proto - cluster ( saiyadpour , deiss & kegel 1997 ; ostriker 1999 ) .",
    "furthermore , relative ammonia - clump  c@xmath77o - core velocities in larger ( by a factor of 23 ) c@xmath77o cores are often observed to be significantly smaller ( @xmath78  km / sec ) than the observed velocity dispersion ( @xmath79  km / s ) of the core , which is thought to be close to the virial value of the core ( fig .  45 in benson & myers 1989 ) . in this picture ,",
    "individual stellar systems remain trapped in the potential wells locally dominated by the clumps that formed them , until most of the gas is removed .",
    "clearly , relative clump  clump velocities need to be measured for cores containing many clumps , to verify if this picture is correct .",
    "finally , the proper motion measurements within the trapezium cluster ( section  [ sec : veld ] ) can not exclude a model in which the cluster is collapsing , or is in the phase of violent relaxation ( lynden - bell 1967 ) after a cold collapse .      for each model",
    "cluster different assumptions concerning the primordial binary star population are made . in table",

    "the hypothesis is that the binary proportion is lower in higher temperature star - forming clouds ( durisen & sterzik 1994 ) .",
    "additionally , the following assumptions are made :    * the primordial mass - ratio distribution is obtained by random pairing of the stars .",
    "-1 mm * the primordial eccentricity distribution is thermally relaxed .",
    "the first assumption implies a mass - ratio distribution for g - dwarf systems that increases steeply towards low - mass secondaries .",
    "however , in the galactic field ( duquennoy & mayor 1991 ) , the mass - ratio distribution for g - dwarf binary systems contains fewer m  dwarf companions than the initial model here .",
    "the assumption and galactic - field distribution are consistent with each other , because dynamical interactions in clusters can explain the observed properties of binary stars in the galactic field , this being part of the _ inverse dynamical population synthesis _",
    "argument for a clustered origin of most stars ( kroupa 1995a , 1995b ) .",
    "the available observational evidence on the mass - ratio distribution of very young stars is also consistent with the assumption of random - pairing from the imf ( leinert et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "the second assumption is necessary , because dynamical interactions in a galactic cluster can not evolve an arbitrary initial eccentricity distribution to the thermal distribution observed for main sequence binary systems with log@xmath89 , in which the number of systems increases linearly with the eccentricity .",

    "an equilibrium is reached between the global properties of the cluster and its remaining binary population after about  2  myr .",
    "this implies that the distribution of binary - star periods , in particular the truncation period , in a galactic cluster is a measure of its dynamical state at birth , or at the moment of maximum compression ( e.g. after a cold collapse ) .",

    "owing to the rapid expansion of models  b1 and  b2 , the initial binary population remains essentially unchanged .",
    "in these models , the binary proportion at a time @xmath235 ago must have been @xmath236 to be consistent with the observational constraints .",
    "this is lower than the binary proportion in taurus ",
    "auriga , and , if model  b2 does represent reality , may be due to dynamical evolution in the embedded cluster prior to gas expulsion , or due to a dependency on cloud temperature as suggested by durisen & sterzik ( 1994 ) .",
    "this would support the assertion that most galactic - field stars stem from trapezium - cluster like assemblages , provided the discrepancy in the proportion of wide binaries in the trapezium cluster and the galactic field can be accounted for ( section  [ sec : binariesb ] ) .",
    "the finding that expanding model  b2 is consistent with the observational constraints suggests that a gas mass of approximately @xmath237 may have been expelled about @xmath238  yr ago .",
    "this quantity of ejected gas is consistent with observations of outflows from young ob stars ( churchwell 1997 ) .",
    "the observations show that hundreds of @xmath43 of gas are expelled within a few to tens of @xmath239  yr per massive star .",

    "1997 ; odell 1999 ) .",
    "it is feasible that the massive outflows from the ob stars , that must have existed in the past , escaped from the cluster in that direction .",
    "the possible rather short expansion age of the trapezium cluster is interesting in the context of the existence of circum - stellar material around many of the low - mass stars in the trapezium cluster .",

    "if the age were a few @xmath75  yr , most of the circum - stellar material seen around the majority of low - mass stars should have been removed .",
    "odell ( 1999 ) , however , points out that the circum - stellar material may have quasi - equilibrium atmospheres with a much lower mass - loss rate , implying that these objects could be as old as hr diagram fitting implies the cluster to be ( section  [ sec : numb_age ] ) .",
    "at present the issue is unsettled , and the present stellar - dynamical models add tantalising evidence in favour of the trapezium cluster becoming visible only a few @xmath239  yr ago by @xmath240  ori  c `` turning on '' .",
    "the main shortcoming of the present study is that the trapezium cluster is treated as an isolated entity . in reality",
    ", it appears to be the core of the much more massive and extended orion nebula cluster ( onc ) .",

    "hillenbrand & hartmann ( 1998 ) estimate that the mass in the stellar component of the onc and in the gas may together suffice to produce the observed stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "it is clear that future models will need to include the onc , and at a later stage the molecular cloud , being computationally much more expensive .",
    "however , even in this context and given the present results , it can be envisioned that the dense core of the onc , namely the trapezium cluster , may have begun expanding a few  @xmath239  yr ago .",
    "a companion paper ( kroupa 1999 ) generalises the present results to different values of @xmath90 and @xmath48 , thereby identifying the candidate sets of models consistent with the observational constraints , if the onc is in virial equilibrium , expanding or undergoing a cold collapse .",
    "finally , the results presented here assume the clusters are initially plummer density distributions .",
    "this is realistic in the sense that star - forming cores are centrally concentrated , which has been used in the past to argue that plummer distributions are reasonable initial conditions for young star clusters ( lada , margulis & dearborn 1984 ) .",
    "we expect all density distributions that are centrally peaked and that have the same central densities , masses and half - mass radii as the models here to lead to a very similar evolution of the binary population , although the detailed radial dependence at some time @xmath100 may be slightly different .",
    "the greatest differences are expected for clusters that initially consist of groupings of aggregates , in the sense of a hierarchical structure .",
    "n - body calculations of the evolution of a cluster of sub - clusters , each containing approximately a dozen binary systems , have to be performed in order to address this particular set of possible models of the trapezium cluster and the onc .",
    "however , here again we expect similar evolution in the final bound cluster after the sub - clusters have merged , although the number of escaping stars will be higher during the first few global crossing times ( aarseth & hills 1972 ) .",
    "this paper presents fully self - consistent stellar - dynamical models of the evolution of the trapezium cluster over a time - span of 5  myr , assuming it consists of 1600  stars with a mass of @xmath241 .",
    "the calculations treat model clusters that are ( i ) in virial equilibrium , ( ii ) expanding and ( iii ) undergoing cold collapse .",
    "all models have a very large primordial binary population .",
    "these models constitute the hitherto most realistic stellar - dynamical calculations of a young cluster in existence , covering the time after gas expulsion but before stellar evolution becomes significant .",
    "thus , cooling of a cluster through the ionization of long - period binaries has been discovered for the first time to be a noticeable effect , if the primordial period distribution is similar to what is seen in the taurus  auriga star formation complex .",
    "the calculations show that a young compact cluster , that is similar to the trapezium cluster and in virial equilibrium , undergoes significant dynamical evolution during the first few  myr .",
    "the same holds true for its binary population , which is depleted rapidly , but then stabilises at @xmath242 if the initial period distribution is as in the galactic field or taurus  auriga - like , respectively .",
    "this work also demonstrates which observational constraints are critical for discerning between models of very young clusters .",
    "these are the inner and outer binary proportions , and the radial bulk motion .    in a young cluster",
    "the period distribution is truncated at a period that depends on the initial dynamical state of the cluster , with little further evolution after a few  myr , or after violent relaxation has occurred .",
    "measurement of the period distribution , or at least of the truncation period , in a cluster such as the pleiades or hyades , thus constrains the possible range of initial configurations of these clusters .",
    "we are particularly interested to have discovered that the expanding cluster model is in best agreement with the observational constraints .",
    "this model assumes that about @xmath237 of gas was expelled from the cluster about @xmath243  yr ago , implying that the binary proportion at that time must have been significantly below the taurus ",
    "auriga value , and that the trapezium cluster is unlikely to form a long - lived bound galactic cluster .",
    "the expansion rate is thus a very potent observable that urgently needs to be determined .",
    "the present models have a projected bulk radial velocity within a central radius of 0.41  pc of about 2  km / s at an expansion age of 50000  yr .",
    "while the present models are not a unique set of stellar - dynamical descriptions of the trapezium cluster , the present results will form an incentive for future observational studies ( i ) of the binary proportion in the inner and outer regions of very young star clusters , and ( ii ) of the velocity dispersion and bulk radial motions in the clusters .",
    "the results , and in particular their generalisation to a larger range of parameter space , will also be a strong incentive for conducting further , much more cpu - intensive numerical experiments , which are already being planned and partially underway .    * acknowledgements * we are very grateful to sverre aarseth for freely providing nbody5 , and for his unfailing , friendly and uniquely efficient `` customer support '' .",
