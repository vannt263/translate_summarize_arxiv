    "in the standard model , sm , transition rates of semileptonic processes such as @xmath2 , with @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) being a generic down ( up ) quark , can be computed with high accuracy in terms of the fermi coupling @xmath5 and the elements @xmath6 of the cabibbo - kobayashi maskawa ( ckm ) matrix .",
    "measurements of the transition rates provide therefore precise determinations of the fundamental sm couplings .",
    "a detailed analysis of semileptonic decays offers also the possibility to set stringent constraints on new physics scenarios .",
    "while within the sm all @xmath2 transitions are ruled by the same ckm coupling @xmath6 ( satisfying the unitarity condition @xmath7 ) and @xmath5 is the same coupling appearing in the muon decay , this is not necessarily true beyond the sm .",
    "setting bounds on the violations of ckm unitarity , violations of lepton universality , and deviations from the @xmath8 structure , allows us to put significant constraints on various new - physics scenarios ( or eventually find evidences of new physics ) .    in the case of leptonic and semileptonic",
    "@xmath1 decays these tests are particularly significant given the large amount of data recently collected by several experiments : bnl - e865 , kloe , ktev , istra+ , and na48 .",
    "the analysis of these data provides precise determination of fundamental sm couplings , sets stringent sm test almost free from hadronic uncertainties , and finally can discriminate between new physics scenarios .",
    "the high statistical precision of measurements and the detailed information on kinematical distributions have pushed a substantial progress on the theory side , in particular the theoretical error on hadronic form factors has been reduced at the 1% level .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first in sec",
    ".  [ brfits ] we present fits to world data on the leading branching ratios and lifetimes , for @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 mesons .",
    "[ slopes ] summarizes the status of the knowledge of form factor slopes from @xmath12 decays .",
    "the physics results obtained are described in sec .",
    "[ resulta ] , in particular the measurement of @xmath13 .",
    "finally , to the special role of @xmath14 ratio is devoted the sec .",
    "numerous measurements of the principal kaon brs , or of various ratios of these brs , have been published recently . for the purposes of evaluating @xmath13 ,",
    "these data can be used in a pdg - like fit to the brs and lifetime , so all such measurements are interesting .",
    "a detailed description to the fit procedure and the references of all experimental input used can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "for @xmath9 the results are given in table  [ tab : klbr ] , while table  [ tab : kpmbr ] gives the results for @xmath11 .",

    "the value of @xmath17 has been determined from the decay rate of kaon semileptonic decays ( see  @xcite for the detailed decomposition ) . using the world average values",
    "reported in previous sections for lifetimes , branching ratios and phase space integrals .     for all channels .",
    "[ fig : vusf0 ] ]    the results are shown in figure  [ fig : vusf0 ] for @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and for the combination . the average , @xmath23 , has an uncertainty of about of @xmath24 .",
    "the results from the five modes are in good agreement , the fit probability is 58% . in particular , comparing the values of @xmath17 obtained from @xmath25 and @xmath26 we obtain a value of the su(2 ) breaking correction @xmath27 in agreement with the chpt calculation @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , recent analyzes on the so - called violations of dashen s theorem in the kaon electromagnetic mass splitting point to @xmath29 values of about @xmath30 .",
    "the test of lepton flavor universality ( lfu ) between @xmath31 and @xmath32 modes constraints a possible anomalous lepton - flavor dependence in the leading weak vector current .",
    "it can therefore be compared to similar tests in @xmath33 decays , but is different from the lfu tests in the helicity - suppressed modes @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the results on the parameter @xmath36 is @xmath37 , in excellent agreement with lepton universality . with a precision of @xmath38 the test in @xmath39 decays",
    "has now reached the sensitivity of other determinations : @xmath40 and @xmath41  @xcite    an independent determination of @xmath0 is obtained from @xmath42 decays .",
    "the most important mode is @xmath43 , which has been recently updated by kloe reaching a relative uncertainty of about @xmath44 .",
    "hadronic uncertainties are minimized considering the ratio @xmath45 . using the world average values of br(@xmath46 ) and of @xmath47 given in section  [ brfits ] and the value of @xmath48 from  @xcite we obtain : @xmath49 .",
    "the main obstacle in transforming these highly precise determinations of @xmath17 and @xmath52 into a determination of @xmath53 at the per - mil level are the theoretical uncertainties on the hadronic parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "this hadronic quantity can not be computed in perturbative qcd , but it is highly constrained by @xmath54 and chiral symmetry . in the chiral limit and , more generally , in the @xmath54 limit ( @xmath55 ) the conservation of the vector current implies @xmath50=1 .",
    "expanding around the chiral limit in powers of light quark masses we can write @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the nlo and nnlo corrections in chpt .",
    "the ademollo  gatto theorem implies that @xmath59 is at least of second order in the breaking of @xmath54 this in turn implies that @xmath57 is free from the uncertainties of the @xmath60 counterterms in chpt , and it can be computed with high accuracy : @xmath61 . the difficulties in estimating @xmath50 begin with @xmath58 or at @xmath62 in the chiral expansion .",
    "several analytical approaches to determine @xmath58 have been attempted over the years , essentially confirming the original estimate by leutwyler and roos .",
    "the benefit of these new results , obtained using more sophisticated techniques , lies in the fact that a better control over the systematic uncertainties of the calculation has been obtained .",
    "however , the size of the error is still around or above @xmath63 , which is not comparable to the @xmath24 accuracy which has been reached for @xmath64 .",
    "recent progress in lattice qcd gives us more optimism in the reduction of the error on @xmath50 below the @xmath63 level .",
    "most of the currently available lattice qcd results have been obtained with relatively heavy pions and the chiral extrapolation represents the dominant source of uncertainty .",
    "there is a general trend of lattice qcd results to be slightly lower than analytical approaches .",
    "an important step in the reduction of the error associated to the chiral extrapolation has been recently made by the ukqcd - rbc collaboration .",
    "their preliminary result @xmath65 is obtained from the unquenched study with @xmath66 flavors , with an action that has good chiral properties on the lattice even at finite lattice spacing ( domain - wall quarks ) .",
    "they also reached pions masses ( @xmath67 mev ) much lighter than that used in previous studies of @xmath50 .",
    "the overall error is estimated to be @xmath68 , which is very encouraging .",
    "in contrast to the semileptonic vector form factor , the pseudoscalar decay constants are not protected by the ademollo  gatto theorem and receive corrections linear in the quark masses .",
    "expanding @xmath51 in power of quark masses , in analogy to @xmath50 , @xmath69 one finds that the @xmath60 contribution @xmath70 is already affected by local contributions and can not be unambiguously predicted in chpt . as a result , in the determination of @xmath51 lattice qcd",
    "has essentially no competition from purely analytical approaches .",
    "the present overall accuracy is about @xmath63 .",
    "the novelty are the new lattice results with @xmath66 dynamical quarks and pions as light as @xmath71  mev , obtained by using the so - called staggered quarks .",
    "these analyzes cover a broad range of lattice spacings ( i.e.  @xmath72=0.06 and 0.15 fm ) and is performed on sufficiently large physical volumes ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that the sensitivity of @xmath51 to lighter pions is larger than in the computation of @xmath50 and that chiral extrapolations are far more demanding in this case . in the following analysis",
    "we will use as reference value the milc - hpqcd result @xmath74 .      to determine @xmath53 and @xmath75 we use the value @xmath76 , the result @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 . from the above",
    "we find : @xmath80 from @xmath12 only , and @xmath81 from @xmath82 only .",
    "these determinations can be used in a fit together with the the recent evaluation of @xmath83 from @xmath84 nuclear beta decays : @xmath75=0.97418@xmath850.00026 .",
    "this global fit gives @xmath86 and @xmath87 , with @xmath88 ( 42% ) .",
    "this result does not make use of ckm unitarity .",
    "if the unitarity constraint is included , the fit gives @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( 67% ) .",
    "both results are illustrated in fig .",

    "the test of ckm unitarity can be also interpreted as a test of universality of the lepton and quark gauge couplings . using the results of the fit ( without imposing unitarity ) we obtain : @xmath93^{1/2 } = ( 1.1662 \\pm   0.0004)\\times 10^{-5}\\   { \\rm gev}^{-2}$ ] , in perfect agreement with the value obtained from the measurement of the muon lifetime : @xmath94 the current accuracy of the lepton - quark universality sets important constraints on model building beyond the sm .",
    "for example , the presence of a @xmath95 would affect the relation between @xmath96 and @xmath97 . in case of a @xmath95 from @xmath98",
    "grand unification theories we obtain @xmath99  gev at 95% cl , to be compared with the @xmath100  gev bound set through the direct collider searches  @xcite . in a similar way , the unitarity constraint also provides useful bounds in various supersymmetry - breaking scenarios .",
    "a particularly interesting test is the comparison of the @xmath53 value extracted from the helicity - suppressed @xmath82 decays with respect to the value extracted from the helicity - allowed @xmath12 modes . to reduce theoretical uncertainties from @xmath101 and electromagnetic corrections in @xmath82",
    ", we exploit the ratio @xmath102 and we study the quantity @xmath103 within the sm , @xmath104 , while deviation from 1 can be induced by non - vanishing scalar- or right - handed currents .",
    "notice that in @xmath105 the hadronic uncertainties enter through @xmath106 .",
    "in the case of effect of scalar currents due to a charged higgs , the unitarity relation between @xmath75 extracted from @xmath84 nuclear beta decays and @xmath53 extracted from @xmath107 remains valid as soon as form factors are experimentally determined .",
    "this constrain together with the experimental information of @xmath108 can be used in the global fit to improve the accuracy of the determination of @xmath105 , which in this scenario turns to be @xmath109 . here",
    "@xmath106 has been fixed from lattice .",
    "this ratio is the key quantity to be improved in order to reduce present uncertainty on @xmath105 .",
    "this measurement of @xmath105 can be used to set bounds on the charged higgs mass and @xmath110 .",
    "figure [ fig : higgskmunu ] shows the excluded region at 95% cl in the @xmath111@xmath110 plane .",
    "the measurement of br(@xmath112 ) can be also used to set a similar bound in the @xmath111@xmath110 plane .",
    "while @xmath113 can exclude quite an extensive region of this plane , there is an uncovered region in the exclusion corresponding to a destructive interference between the charged - higgs and the sm amplitude .",
    "this region is fully covered by the @xmath114 result .",
    "excluded region in the charged higgs mass-@xmath110 plane .",
    "the region excluded by @xmath115 is also indicated . ]",
    "the vector and scalar form factors @xmath116 are analytic functions in the complex @xmath117plane , except for a cut along the positive real axis , starting at the first physical threshold @xmath118 , where they develop discontinuities .",
    "they are real for @xmath119 .",
    "cauchy s theorem implies that @xmath116 can be written as a dispersive integral along the physical cut where all possible on - shell intermediate states contribute to its imaginary part .",
    "a number of subtractions is needed to make the integral convergent .",
    "particularly appealing is an improved dispersion relation recently proposed where two subtractions are performed at @xmath120 ( where by definition , @xmath121 ) and at the so - called callan - treiman point @xmath122 .",
    "since the callan - treiman relation fixes the value of scalar form factor at @xmath123 to the ratio @xmath106 , the dispersive parametrization for the scalar form factor allows to transform the available measurements of the scalar form factor into a precise information on @xmath106 , completely independent of the lattice estimates .",
    "figure [ fig : cttest ] shows the values for @xmath50 determined from the scalar form factor slope measurements obtained using a dispersive parametrization and the callan - treiman relation , and @xmath74 . from result on the ff slope using the dispersive parameterization the value of @xmath65 from ukqcd / rbc",
    "is also shown .",

    "[ fig : cttest ] ]",
    "the ratio @xmath125 can be precisely calculated within the standard model . neglecting radiative corrections , it is given by @xmath126 and reflects the strong helicity suppression of the electron channel .",
    "radiative corrections have been computed with effective theories , yielding the final sm prediction @xmath127 because of the helicity suppression within then sm , the @xmath128 amplitude is a prominent candidate for possible sizable contributions from physics beyond the sm .",
    "moreover , when normalizing to the @xmath129 rate , we obtain an extremely precise prediction of the @xmath128 width within the sm . in order to be visible in the @xmath130 ratio",
    ", the new physics must violate lepton flavor universality .",
    "recently it has been pointed out that in a supersymmetric framework sizable violations of lepton universality can be expected in @xmath35 decays . at the tree level ,",
    "lepton flavor violating terms are forbidden in the mssm .",
    "however , these appear at the one - loop level , where an effective @xmath131 yukawa interaction is generated .",
    "the non - sm contribution to @xmath132 can be written as @xmath133{\\mbox , } $ ] where @xmath134 , the lepton flavor violating coupling , being generated at the loop level , could reach values of @xmath135 .",
    "for moderately large @xmath136 values , this contribution may therefore enhance @xmath132 by up to a few percent .",
    "experimental knowledge of @xmath130 has been poor so far .",
    "the current world average of @xmath137 dates back to three experiments of the 1970s  @xcite and has a precision of about 5% .",
    "three new preliminary measurements were reported by na48/2 and kloe ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "both , the kloe and the na48/2 measurements are inclusive with respect to final state radiation contribution due to bremsstrahlung . combining these new results with the current pdg value yields a current world average of @xmath138 , with a relative error of @xmath139 , a factor three more precise than the previous world average .",
    "this value is in very good agreement with the sm expectation and gives strong constraints for @xmath136 and @xmath140 , as shown in fig .",
