    "the existence of generations of particle families is one of the deepest conundrums in theoretical physics . who can forget rabi s exclamation upon the discovery of the muon : `` who ordered that ? '' .",
    "the invocation of a new family symmetry group offers no explanation to rabi but can serve as a useful classification tool and it can even be gauged . over the last few years we have suggested that the full description of events through a spacetime @xmath5 enlarged by anticommuting complex scalar coordinates @xmath6 , which correspond to fundamental properties , can serve to explain naturally the repetition of particle families .",
    "put another way , we have proposed that the attributes of events represent the extra dimensions which everyone is chasing ; such an approach is distinct from other attempts at unification .",
    "we have gone on to show that the forces and their parity violation ( at low energies anyway ) can be accommodated through the curvature of the metric in the enlarged spacetime @xmath7 particularly via the @xmath8 sector , making a distinction between left and right attributes .",
    "the article@xcite on `` the force and gravity of events '' contains a detailed reference list describing progressive steps made in researching this scenario .",
    "our investigations have shown that a bare minimum of three ( parity blind ) colour properties @xmath9 plus two electroweak properties @xmath10 , _ further distinguished by their parities _ , can potentially produce the known generations and can even describe the standard model ( sm ) interactions correctly ; the force fields arise through the gauge mesons embedded in the frame vectors that connect spacetime to property at the same time that gravitational properties in the spacetime sector stay impartial with respect to handedness , at least semiclassically . on several occasions@xcite",
    "we have alluded to some of the multiplets engendered by such a scheme , but we have never provided a _ full _ inventory of the states which ensue . that is the purpose of this article as well as constructing the interactions between all the fields posited by the standard model .",
    "the state zoo predicted by such a scheme arises when the superfields @xmath11 are expanded in @xmath6 and its conjugate @xmath12 .",
    "there one encounters a _",
    "finite _ number of terms @xmath13 & @xmath14 , where @xmath15 run up to the number of properties , with due care taken to obey the spin - statistics theorem .",
    "even so , a considerable number of expansion terms are produced even with only @xmath16 properties .",
    "however once we realise that unitary representations @xmath17 are unaffected by the ` duality ' substitution @xmath18 , we can apply a duality symmetry to reduce substantially the number of terms in the superfield expansions .",
    "interestingly , the imposition of duality is essential to obtain sensible lagrangians for the component fields after integrating over property .",
    "this is explained at length in the next section as well as the appendix .",
    "we make particular choices of duality for each of the subgroups of the sm and , following that , enumerate the full list of right and left states in section 3 , paying particular heed to the many chargeless higgs fields held in @xmath19 since they are responsible for mass generation of bosons and fermions through the yukawa interaction .",
    "the use of a universal property curvature polynomial leads to a determination of the weak mixing angle by demanding universal gravitational coupling to the gauge fields ; the value of that angle is close to experimental measurements before taking account of quantum corrections .",
    "we conclude with some remarks about this whole approach in the final section .",
    "we start with just a single property , corresponding to one complex @xmath6 , representing electricity . paying no regard to parity at this stage and reminding ourselves that bosons are associated with even powers and fermions with odd powers ,",
    "the expansions of the superfields in @xmath6 become rather trivial : @xmath20 note that @xmath19 and @xmath21 ( the latter carries a spinorial index ) are both bosonic but their expansion coefficients have the correct spin - statistics connection .",
    "we shall be integrating over @xmath6 so we will use the convention properties , consult the appendix for our convention . ]",
    "that @xmath22 .",
    "it follows that the integrated bilinear @xmath23 can hardly serve as a suitable lagrangian .",
    "this is where the concept of grassmannian duality comes to the rescue . with only one property , dualization , indicated by the superscript @xmath0 ,",
    "corresponds to @xmath24 therefore the selfdual @xmath6 polynomials are @xmath25 and @xmath6 , while the anti - selfdual polynomial is @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "requiring selfduality means setting @xmath28 and permits suitable lagrangian bilinears : @xmath29 double dualization amounts to the identity operation , and self - evidently the total number of component fields for anti - selfdual plus selfdual adds up to what one would get without imposing those conditions .      our starting point is the pair of properties , @xmath30 signifying neutrinicity and @xmath31 signifying charge -1 leptonicity ; for the present we disregard colour and therefore strong interactions ( to which we presently assign the labels @xmath32 , signifying colour down - type quarks ) . later on we have to distinguish between left and right leptonicity .    here",
    "we are dealing with an su(2 ) subgroup of sp(4 ) .",
    "when we expand the superfields in powers @xmath33 with @xmath15 running from 0 to 2 we obtain the square given in table 1 where it will be seen that reflection about the diagonal corresponds to charge conjugation , whereas reflection about the cross - diagonal corresponds to taking the dual .    with regard to duality signs , we use the antisymmetric levi - civita symbols , @xmath34 with @xmath35 . introduce the abbreviation @xmath36 , so @xmath37 . then the duality operation results in : @xmath38 plus all their adjoints .",
    "this then allows us to separate the two possibilities :      for fermions we get @xmath39 ignoring  conjugates which only serve to double the final results .",
    "the selfdual bose superfield expansion on the other hand reads @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a singlet and @xmath42 is an isotriplet .",
    "these fields comprise eight components in toto .      here",
    "we get instead @xmath43 plus conjugates , and @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a complex isosinglet .",
    "this set also contains eight components .",
    "added to the previous ( selfdual ) set we get a total of 16 states , agreeing with the number of coefficients expected for these expansions without imposing duality .",
    "presently we will be distinguishing between left and right properties @xmath46 as demanded by the gauge interactions of the standard model ; so the above analysis can be applied to each of the su(2 ) _ classification _ subgroups in the overarching group @xmath47 , though specifically right - handed gauge fields do not exist in the standard model .",
    "thus the allowed _ selfdual _ combinations with their dimensionalities , for each chirality , are @xmath48 with the singlet @xmath49 eliminated .",
    "with reference to the triplet , it has the three components @xmath50/\\sqrt{2 } , -\\zeta^{\\bar{0}}\\zeta^4 ) { \\rm ~carrying~ charges~}(1,0,-1).$ ] it is to be understood that this shorthand for the triplet , viz .",
    "@xmath51 , will appear subsequently for each of the left or right su(2 ) subgroups .",
    "on the other hand , the _ anti - selfdual _ combinations with their dimensionalities , for each chirality , are @xmath52      we now turn to the strong interaction sector and colour to see what selfduality has to say about this .",
    "table 2 is the analogue of table 1 , before imposition of duality , and contains the following entries for the su(3 ) representations arising from @xmath53 expansion .",
    "observe that the @xmath54-fold colour multiplet contains such components as @xmath55 , in contrast to the triplet @xmath56 , where @xmath57 .",
    "the duality signs are encapsulated by the typical entries : @xmath58",
    "the consequence is that the _ selfdual _",
    "combinations for 3 properties ( including conjugates ) , with their su(3 ) dimensionalities comprise the sets : @xmath59 with the triplet @xmath60 eliminated .",
    "this makes for a total of 36 selfdual states .",
    "the _ anti - selfdual states _ number 28 states : @xmath61 with the singlet @xmath62 excised . added to the selfdual ones , we get a total of 64 states , as expected .",
    "( for @xmath63 properties there are @xmath64 states before constraining them by duality . )",
    "subsequently , when constructing lagrangians , it is important to point out that the integrals over property of quadratic combinations such as @xmath65 vanish identically .",
    "however cubic terms , which arise when considering yukawa couplings , such as @xmath66 , survive property integration .",
    "that applies to each of the subgroups , being independent of the number of properties .",
    "at this point we can combine all of the attributes and determine the complete set of states , taking into account parity too  we did not do this previously when we just considered the grand unified group su(5 ) duality constraints . in order to decide",
    "what type of duality is to be applied to each of the standard model subgroups , we must make sure that certain ` unwanted ' combinations are duly expunged and that we cover the known generations of quarks and leptons , as well as incorporating proper higgs - like states .",
    "another important consideration is that the fermionic states have to be constrained to be of two types , purely left or purely right ; we can not entertain a schizophrenic or ambidextrous possibility of mixing these two sorts of chirality _ unless one of them is an ineffective singlet _ in the product . on the contrary",
    ", the scalar fields _ must bridge right and left _ , which may dictate a different choice of duality from the fermions .",
    "so let us start off with the quarks : colour triplets and weak isodoublets .",
    "let @xmath67 refer to chromic property ( which strictly speaking should carry contravariant labels 1,2,3 ) .",
    "when we paid no heed to chirality and ignored duality we were able to identify two typical @xmath68 cases : @xmath69 and @xmath70 as having the correct colour and charge quantum numbers .",
    "chromic duality will double these pairs ( whether we pick colour dual or antidual ) and with the first choice we can readily impose left or right - handed characteristics on the leptonic component .",
    "the second choice is more problematic because it involves a lepton - antilepton product .",
    "these must both be left _ or _",
    "right according to our criterion , so referring to sec.2.2.3 and ( 8) we have to take the _ triplet _ combination ; this dictates selfduality for left .",
    "the right products lepton - antilepton accompanying them must not jeopardize the chiral purity and must therefore remain right singlets so , as in ( 9 ) , we have to pick anti - selfduality for right .",
    "when we reverse overall chirality , similar sorts of selections must prevail .    turning to the scalar bosons , we note that @xmath71 has the potential to serve as a higgs boson .",
    "however it is apparent that a similar combination , @xmath72 , is a state with @xmath73 and is undesirable .",
    "besides , such a state would be either left or right and could not bridge chirality . noting that the colour singlet @xmath74 disappears when we adopt colour anti - selfduality this then indicates chromic anti - selfduality as being the proper fermionic choice .",
    "we shall be guided by these considerations below .",
    "let @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 signify the fermionic and bosonic parts of the combinations complying with antiduality , while @xmath78 etc .",
    "signify those combinations which are selfdual .",
    "then the full fundamental fermionic elements consist of the products @xmath79 , in addition to the corresponding terms where one interchanges @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the resulting buildup is based upon stating the attributes of the fundamental properties determined by the action of the standard gauge fields , held in the spacetime - property sector of the metric .",
    "these property attributes are listed in table 3 .",
    "the state inventory comes about through combinations of these properties .",
    "it is noteworthy that sums of these basic attributes correspond exactly to the quantum number assignments made in the sm . before compiling all these products systematically",
    ", it pays to identify where the usual up- , down- quarks and leptons reside , ignoring duality and handedness for now and focussing on their charges .",
    "we have already identified two triplet colour combinations that serve that purpose , namely @xmath82 and ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "this highlights the point that _ we should expect a new colour triplet quark of charge _",
    "-4/3 , identified as the combination @xmath84 . , which is part of a weak isotriplet .",
    "turning to the leptons , @xmath85 ) are of course based on dualized generations of fundamental properties ( @xmath10 ) . where it should be noted from ( 8) that @xmath86 and @xmath87 vanish for a selfdual choice .      as explained above , possible combinations to be considered are multiplicative sets @xmath88 .",
    "these are best summarised by listing the direct product representations and the dimensions of the 3 _ classification _ groups : @xmath89 ; their associated properties are stated in eqs .",
    "( 8),(9),(11 ) and ( 12 ) .",
    "in this way we obtain the left fermion combinations ( including conjugates ) @xmath90 while the right combinations are @xmath91 identifying the quarks and paying little heed to the sizes of the su(2)@xmath2 representations since they are not gauged we can pick out the left quark products : @xmath92 @xmath93 with similar products where left and right are interchanged ( plus their conjugates ) .",
    "the first and second generation of quarks correspond to weak isodoublets but the other quark generations occur in weak isotriplets !",
    "so far as leptons are concerned we have to seek colour singlets so must study the set @xmath94 corresponding to the leptonic products @xmath95 @xmath96 we recognize _ four _ generations of leptons ; so here is another prediction of this scheme .      here",
    "one is obliged to take the following dual multiplicative combinations so as to bridge left and right . relying upon upon anti - selfdual combinations for the chromic sector , and",
    "because @xmath97 does not lead to ambidextrous products , we might be tempted to consider @xmath98 with weak quartets contained within the colour singlet set : @xmath99 however it turns out that the above choices do _ not _ enjoy yukawa interactions with the quark and lepton generations ( at least in flat space ) because of property integration rules .",
    "instead for bosons we are led to relaxing the condition that the chromic sector must be anti - selfdual and consider the following bosonic combinations which are _ overall _ selfdual and which _ do _ interact with the fermions : @xmath100 here the higgs fields are contained within the colour singlet set , @xmath101 this last selection will become clearer when we consider gauge field and yukawa interactions where we also arrange that the superfield @xmath19 is even under left - right interchange .",
    "as there appear to be a menagerie of exotic states ( for which there is as yet no evidence ) as well as quasi - conventional states , let us just focus on the standard particles that are contained in amongst the tables of bosons and fermions listed in the previous section .",
    "we should remind ourselves that the only gauged groups are qcd and the electroweak group , though other researchers  keen on left right symmetry  might advocate more gauging . we need to check that this subset of states enjoy interactions expected of them through the metric element connecting property to spacetime . but before launching into that we also need to ascertain that the gauge field lagrangians themselves emerge correctly from the generalized scalar curvature of the extended space .",
    "we therefore turn to the extended metric which permits the following general form respecting gauge invariance . referring to table 3 , @xmath102 above",
    ", @xmath103 refers to the left weak boson field ( with coupling constant @xmath104 ) , @xmath105 to its hypercharge counterpart ( with coupling constant @xmath106/2 ) , @xmath107 to the gluon field ( with coupling constant @xmath108 ) , @xmath109 to the su(3 ) lambda matrices ; @xmath110 is a generic full vector set comprising all those components multiplied by their coupling constants . @xmath111 and @xmath112 are in principle independent curvature polynomials involving the various invariants @xmath51 associated with the gauge subgroups . to simplify the argument we will take @xmath113 to be universal for gauge fields and gravity as this has little effect on the conclusions . for the standard model",
    "this means that @xmath111 can be a direct product of colour , left and right permissible polynomial factors ; thus @xmath114 introduces seven independent curvature coefficients @xmath115 .",

    ", the need for some kind of duality is imperative and emergence of generations is inevitable . however , assuming our choices are the correct ones , we were able to accommodate the known particle generations , but in the process we were led to predict other generations of quarks and leptons , and especially the existence of a quark carrying charge -4/3 , accompanying @xmath193 say in a weak isospin triplet .",
    "another feature was the emergence of totally sterile scalar states ( 8 of them ) , singlets of all the gauge groups and therefore decoupled from standard matter ; these may or may not have some connection with dark matter ",
    "it is too early to say .",
    "the marriage of gravity to the gauge fields via the frame vectors and insistence on the universal character of coupling to gravity resulted in the prediction of a weak mixing angle which is close to experiment .",
    "apart from researching the mechanism generating masses through expectation values of at least four standard higgs fields which couple to the sources , the property curvature coefficients stick out as the only vague feature of this scheme .",
    "we have been unable to formulate a principle which determines the @xmath115 , which in turn fix the cosmological constant , etc .",
    "what we do know is that pure property transformations like @xmath194 , which do not affect gauge variations , produce nasty looking off - diagonal elements in the property - property sector via the altered metric @xmath195 , etc . conversely those property transformations can be used to eliminate such unpleasant contributions , but will not fix the curvature coefficients",
    "this is the most pressing problem confronting us . only after its proper resolution",
    "might we turn to the brst quantization since there seems to be a natural place for it within the current framework .",
    "a separate issue is the calculation of masses and mixings , where @xmath115 enter once again . in our opinion , it seems unlikely that we will be able to cover the huge and diverse range of masses ( from neutrinos to the top quark and mixings ) with this set of @xmath115 and various @xmath180 ; most probably some dynamical mechanism will be needed to produce the masses of the lighter leptons through their weak interactions and the @xmath115 may themselves be expectation values of additional scalar fields .",
    "if right gauge bosons are experimentally discovered , they are readily incorporated by introducing additional frame vectors affecting the right properties @xmath187 . in the end like everyone else we are hostage to experiment and to what the lhc and future colliders will reveal .",
    "it is entirely possible that this whole scheme will fail miserably by not agreeing with observations and thus turn out to be a figment of imagination .",
    "hopefully some of its ingredients may survive but only time will tell .",
    "brian kenny has been urging me over the years to take the ` next step ' in this approach to unification .",
    "i thank him for his keen interest and continued faith in this program .",
    "in the text we are confronted with integration over properties @xmath53 .",
    "our convention for handling this is as follows .",
    "the grassmannian measure is to be taken in the order @xmath196 where @xmath197 signifies the integer part of @xmath198 .",
    "we define invariants @xmath199 for each of the subgroups ( with appropriate labelling on @xmath178 ) such that for su(@xmath63 ) , @xmath200",
    "if one substitutes @xmath18 in the expansion of a superfield in powers @xmath201 it is a fact that the associated su(@xmath63 ) representations are duplicated , corresponding to reflection about the cross - diagonal we call the act of cross - diagonal reflection the ` duality ' operation and indicate it by the symbol @xmath0 . specifically our rule for determining the factors arising from this reflection is given by @xmath202 this looks rather complicated , but three examples may make this rule clearer . for instance consider colour ( @xmath203 ) ; then the dual of a typical octet element",
    "is associated with a - sign as follows : @xmath204 whereas for the singlet product of the three colours there is no sign change : @xmath205 similarly for the triplet , @xmath206 by these sorts of manipulations we can ascertain the duality signs for all the entries in the expansion table , as stated in the text ; applying selfduality or anti - selfduality can the sometimes serve to eliminate some of the representations sitting on the cross - diagonal .",
    "finally , it goes without saying that dualizing twice results in the identity operation .",
