    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) allows the existence of pure gauge states called glueballs .",
    "although much effort has been devoted to find a clear experimental glueball signal , no unambiguous candidate is known so far  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , glueballs are intensively studied within various theoretical frameworks : lattice qcd  @xcite , coulomb gauge qcd  @xcite , ads / qcd  @xcite , qcd sum rules  @xcite , potential models  @xcite , _ etc_. we refer the interested reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for a review on theoretical glueball physics .",
    "nowadays , the glueball mass spectra computed in lattice qcd have a special status since they are often taken as input to fit the parameters of the existing models .",
    "indeed , clear experimental data related to glueballs are still missing .",
    "the present work is devoted to an effective approach of qcd that has poorly been applied to glueballs so far : the relativistic flux tube model  @xcite .",
    "actually , in the meson case , it follows from nonperturbative qcd in the quenched approximation that the confining interaction between a quark and an antiquark pair is due at the dominant order to a nambu - goto string linking them and carrying both energy and angular momentum  @xcite .",
    "this agrees with lattice qcd simulations showing that the chromoelectric field between a static quark - antiquark pair is roughly constant on a straight line joining these two particles ( see for example the early study @xcite , and the more recent works @xcite ) .",
    "calculations within the dual ginzburg - landau theory also support the existence of a flux tube  @xcite .",
    "the relativistic flux tube model is not a potential approach since the interaction is mediated by a dynamical object . in particular ,",
    "not only light and heavy mesons can be described in that framework  @xcite , but also hybrid mesons when the flux tube is in an excited state  @xcite . here",
    "we extend the relativistic flux tube model to glueballs , assuming that these exotic hadrons can be described as bound states of transverse constituent gluons .",
    "we point out that using longitudinal constituent gluons leads to spurious states with respect to those observed in lattice qcd , and to a mass spectrum that can not agree with the lattice data in the @xmath2 sector  @xcite .    after having recalled how to build quantum states of transverse gluons in section  [ helfor ] , we present the relativistic flux tube model and its generalization to gluonic bound states in section  [ ftm ] .",
    "we also study the regge trajectories , that are a consequence of the relativistic flux tube model in the ultrarelativistic limit , in section  [ regge ] .",
    "then we compute the glueball mass spectrum in section  [ gluspec ] and estimate the glueball decay widths in section  [ decay ] . finally , we discuss about the gluonic content of the @xmath0-@xmath1 resonances , the glueball - pomeron conjecture , and finite - temperature effects in sections  [ etaetap ] , [ glupom ] , and [ finit ] .",
    "our results are summarized in section  [ conclu ] .",
    "the main goal of this work is to build an effective model of glueball based on the relativistic flux model in which the constituent gluons are transverse , that is with helicity-1 .",
    "as we argued in  @xcite , the helicity formalism of jacob and wick  @xcite can be successfully applied to describe a bound state of two such gluons .",
    "it is thus important to show here how to build glueball helicity states before using them as basis states for computations within the relativistic flux tube model .",
    "let us recall the main points of the helicity formalism , introduced in  @xcite .",
    "we first introduce @xmath3 the quantum state of a particle with momentum @xmath4 , spin @xmath5 , and helicity @xmath6 . if the particle is transverse ( with a helicity degree of freedom ) , only @xmath7 is allowed , while the @xmath8 projections from @xmath9 to @xmath10 are allowed if the particle has a spin degree of freedom .",
    "then it can be deduced from  @xcite that the quantum state @xmath11^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\int^{2\\pi}_0d\\phi\\int^\\pi_0d\\theta\\ , \\sin\\theta\\ { \\cal d}^{j*}_{m,\\lambda_1-\\lambda_2}(\\phi,\\theta,-\\phi)\\ , r(\\phi,\\theta,-\\phi)\\ a^{\\dagger}_{\\lambda_1}(\\vec p)a^{\\dagger}_{\\lambda_2}(-\\vec p)\\left|0\\right\\rangle\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] represents a two - particle state in the rest frame of the system which is also an eigenstate of the total spin @xmath12 , _ i.e. _ @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in the above definition , @xmath15 is the rotation operator of euler angles @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the wigner @xmath18-matrices .",
    "the coordinates @xmath19 are the polar angles of @xmath4 .",
    "it is worth recalling the inequality @xmath20 coming from usual spin - coupling rules .",
    "sill by applying the formalism of  @xcite , it can be checked that the state @xmath21\\ ] ] is also an eigenstate of the parity operator with the eigenvalue @xmath22 @xmath23 and @xmath24 denoting the intrinsic parity and spin of particle @xmath25 respectively .",
    "let us note that only the relative sign of @xmath26 and @xmath27 is relevant .",
    "either particles with spin or helicity can be described within this formalism . when both particles have a spin degree of freedom , the helicity basis , spanned by the helicity states  ( [ hstate ] ) , is equivalent to a standard @xmath28 basis up to an orthogonal transformation @xcite .",
    "when at least one of the particles is transverse , both basis are no longer equivalent but the helicity states can still be expressed as particular linear combinations of @xmath28 states @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that only the spin - angular part of the helicity states is fixed by the above geometrical construction .",
    "the radial part of the system needs a particular dynamical model to be determined .",
    "although we will mainly focus on two - gluon states in the present work , it is worth mentioning that three - body helicity states can also be built following a two - by - two recoupling scheme  @xcite .",
    "the idea is to write first the two - body helicity state  ( [ hstate ] ) corresponding to , say , particles 2 and 3 in their rest frame .",
    "then , the lorentz - boosted helicity state of the ( 2,3 ) cluster can be coupled to particle 1 with the same technique .",
    "the boost is needed for the three - body helicity state to be expressed in the three - body rest frame , not in the rest frame of the cluster .",
    "that recoupling procedure can in principle be generalized to @xmath29-body systems .",
    "transverse gluons are such that @xmath30 . since @xmath31 , there are thus four independent helicity states of the form  ( [ hstate ] ) , and the pauli principle must be satisfied . the color wave function of a two - gluon system , @xmath32^{\\bm 1}$ ] , is symmetric and enforces a positive charge conjugation ; one has thus to ask the two - gluon states to be totally symmetric .",
    "the symmetrization leads in general to selection rules on the total spin of the system  @xcite .",
    "we have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that , in the case of two gluons , the symmetrized helicity states read @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath35 ( @xmath18)-states will be referred to as helicity singlets ( doublets ) in the following .",
    "it appears that there are no @xmath36 two - gluon states , in agreement with yang s theorem forbidding the decay of vector mesons in two photons  @xcite .",
    "this fact is also consistent with the absence of low - lying @xmath37 glueballs in the lattice qcd results  @xcite .    once the glueball helicity states  ( [ glustate ] ) are known , it is possible to compute matrix elements .",
    "in particular , we have checked in ref .",
    "@xcite that none of the usual operators ( identity , spin - orbit , tensor ,  ) induce couplings between the @xmath38 and @xmath39 states , that possess the same @xmath40 quantum numbers",
    ". moreover , the average value of the square orbital angular momentum takes the simple form @xmath41 it can be expected that @xmath42 roughly sets the energy scale of a given state : the more rotational energy is contained in a glueball , the heavier the state should be .",
    "this suggests the following mass ordering  @xcite : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , _ etc .",
    "_ , in agreement with the lightest glueball states observed in lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "two is indeed the minimal number of gluons needed to make a color singlet , and it is rather intuitive to see the lightest glueballs as two - gluon bound states .",
    "the situation is more complicated for three - gluon glueballs .",
    "first of all , two color singlets are possible : one symmetric ( leading to @xmath2 ) and one antisymmetric ( leading to @xmath47 ) .",
    "the corresponding color wave functions are @xmath48^{\\bm 8_s},\\bm 8]^{\\bm 1_s}$ ] and @xmath48^{\\bm 8_a},\\bm 8]^{\\bm 1_a}$ ] respectively .",
    "the low - lying @xmath2 glueballs are well - known from lattice computations .",
    "we gave in ref .",
    "@xcite several arguments favoring a three - gluon interpretation of these states , the most obvious ones being that negative charge conjugations can not be reached by a two - gluon bound state , and that the lightest @xmath2 glueballs are heavier than the @xmath47 ones .",
    "moreover , the lowest - lying bound states of three gluons should be @xmath49 and @xmath50 ones , as observed in lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , writing completely symmetrized three - gluon states in the helicity formalism is a complex problem that would deserve a separate paper ; it is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "it is worth saying that building a ( pseudo)scalar state from a totally symmetric three - gluon system might be problematic .",
    "this case is indeed formally identical to a three - photon system .",
    "it has been previously shown that a planar three - photon system where the photons have equal energies and momenta separated by 120@xmath51 from one another can not be in a ( pseudo)scalar state  @xcite .",
    "such a situation is analogous to low - lying three - gluon states ; no light @xmath52 glueball is indeed observed .",
    "however , asymmetric three - photon configurations , that could correspond to highly excited glueballs , can be in such a state  @xcite . consequently ,",
    "if there is a three - gluon glueball with @xmath53 , it must be particularly heavy . in agreement with that picture ,",
    "the heaviest - known glueball on the lattice is a @xmath54 state .",
    "but we argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that , rather than a highly excited three - gluon state , the @xmath54 glueball could also be a low - lying four - gluon state with the nontrivial color wave function @xmath48^{\\bm{10}_a},\\left[\\bm 8,\\bm 8\\right]^{\\overline{\\bm{10}}_a}]^{\\bm 1}$ ] , imposing the mixed symmetry @xmath55 to the spin - space wave function .",
    "notice that @xmath47 glueballs in the mass range of the @xmath2 ones are currently not known from lattice computations since one- and two - glueball states can not be distinguished in this sector  @xcite .",
    "the most interesting states to study there would be the @xmath37 glueballs , that can not be made of two gluons .",
    "gluelumps have been proposed in lattice qcd as a first approach to model gluino - gluon bound states  @xcite .",
    "they are pure gauge states , as glueballs , but this time a static , scalar , color - octet source is present in the system .",
    "it appears that the gluelump masses are particularly low ( the static source is decoupled from the system ) , actually lower than the lightest glueballs ; the lightest gluelump is indeed a @xmath56 state of mass 0.87@xmath57  gev  @xcite .",
    "this can be understood in terms of constituent gluons because the presence of the color - octet source allows for only one gluon to be bound in a color singlet .",
    "gluelumps seen as one - gluon states have been studied in detail within the coulomb gauge qcd approach  @xcite , but also with a spinless salpeter hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "the gluelump helicity states can be found in this last reference and read @xmath58 ; formula  ( [ lsdef ] ) also holds in this case .",
    "we point out that using longitudinal gluons would lead to a low - lying @xmath59 gluelump , in disagreement with the lattice data .",
    "interestingly , one - gluon states have been studied in lattice qcd more than twenty years ago in order to estimate the constituent gluon mass  @xcite .",
    "the following idea has been applied : the potential between two static color - octet sources should saturate at the energy at which a pair of gluons can be created from the vacuum .",
    "the energy of a confined gluon is thus half that energy .",
    "one arrives at an estimate of 500 - 800  mev  @xcite . in the bag model ,",
    "the same quantity can be computed and is given by @xmath60  mev  @xcite , a value compatible with the @xmath56 gluelump . interpreting the mass of that gluelump as a constituent gluon mass ,",
    "one estimates the low - lying two- and three - gluon glueballs to be around @xmath61  gev and @xmath62  gev , in agreement with lattice computations  @xcite .",
    "once glueball helicity states are known , a hamiltonian remains to be specified . to this aim , we present in this section the relativistic flux tube model .",
    "although its original formulation , concerning mesons , relies on purely phenomenological grounds  @xcite , the relativistic flux tube model has been shown to be a well - defined approximation of the nonperturbative qcd interactions between a quark and an antiquark  @xcite .",
    "we recall here the main aspects of this model , and refer the interested reader to these last two references for more details .",
    "let us begin by the case of a meson .",
    "the study of the quark - antiquark green function in qcd involves the wilson loop whose study eventually leads to crucial information about nonperturbative effects in qcd .",
    "in particular , an effective quark - antiquark lagrangian can be obtained from the wilson loop provided that the quenched approximation is made and that only the long - range , spin - independent , part of the interactions is considered .",
    "the spin- and short - range effects are actually not expected to be dominant with respect to the long - range interactions corresponding to the confinement .",
    "this covariant effective lagrangian reads @xcite @xmath63 with the boundary conditions @xmath64 the first two terms of lagrangian  ( [ lag1 ] ) are kinetic terms corresponding to the quark and the antiquark seen as massive spinless color sources , whose position in minkowski spacetime is given by the four - vector @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath66 is a timelike evolution parameter of the system , and the dotted quantities denote a derivation with respect to this parameter .",
    "the third term of lagrangian  ( [ lag1 ] ) is a nambu - goto lagrangian .",
    "it describes a string of generic energy density @xmath67 linking the constituent particles through the boundary conditions  ( [ bound ] ) .",
    "we notice that the string coordinates @xmath68 also depend on a spacelike parameter labeling its different points ; the prime denotes a derivation with respect to @xmath69 .",
    "this string is the so - called relativistic flux tube ( or qcd string ) .",
    "it is a dynamical object arising from the nonperturbative part of the strong interaction .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the formation of flux tubes in qcd is supported in the meson and baryon cases by lattice qcd simulations .",
    "moreover , it is of particular interest for the present study to stress that recent lattice qcd computations strongly favor the flux - tube picture in systems with constituent gluons like quark - antiquark - gluon  @xcite and three - gluon systems  @xcite .",
    "notice that , in all these lattice studies , quarks and gluons are seen as static color sources .",
    "finally , lagrangian  ( [ lag1 ] ) has been shown to be valid also for two - gluon systems in ref .",
    "the relativistic flux tube picture thus appears to be an interesting effective approach in the case of hadronic bound states .",
    "a comment on the value of @xmath67 should be done at this stage .",
    "let us denote @xmath70 the fundamental string tension , _",
    "i.e. _ the energy density of a flux tube linking a quark and an antiquark . then , several lattice studies suggest that the adjoint string tension , that is energy density of a flux tube linking two static color - octet sources , should be given by @xmath71  @xcite . in other words , we consider that the string tension scales as the quadratic color casimir operator : this is the casimir scaling hypothesis .",
    "it is convenient for further calculations to work in the temporal ( or instantaneous ) gauge , that is @xmath72 . in that gauge ,",
    "the solution of the string equations of motion is simply given by the straight line @xmath73 ; see for example  @xcite .",
    "notice that the linearity of the flux tubes is in agreement with lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "once lagrangian  ( [ lag1 ] ) is rewritten in the temporal gauge and with a straight flux tube , the relativistic flux tube equations can be obtained in the hamiltonian formalism  @xcite . in their quantized version",
    ", those equations read , in the rest frame and in the equal mass case ( @xmath74 )  @xcite @xmath75 where @xmath76 denotes the anticommutator , and where @xmath77 @xmath78 represents the modulus of the transverse velocity of the particles , and commutes neither with the radius @xmath79 nor with the radial momentum @xmath80 .",
    "that is why various symmetrizations have to be performed .",
    "the complexity of these last equations comes from the fact that the contribution of the flux tube does not reduce to a static potential : this object is dynamical , and carries orbital angular momentum as well as energy . in consequence",
    ", @xmath78 can not be extracted from  ( [ tf_equa1 ] ) and the hamiltonian can not be written in a closed form .",
    "one can observe in  ( [ tf_equa2 ] ) that the linearly rising potential commonly used to describe confinement is supplemented by terms involving @xmath78 , thus by relativistic effects due to the flux tube .",
    "also the kinetic part is logically affected by these relativistic effects .",
    "we mention for completeness that equations generalizing  ( [ tf_equa1 ] ) and ( [ tf_equa2 ] ) can be obtained in the meson case when the spin of the quark and of the antiquark is no longer neglected  @xcite .",
    "the resulting equations are quite complicated and we will not write them here explicitly .",
    "one actually gets couplings between the quark spin and the flux tube that can be understood as a thomas precession in the color field generated by the flux tubes  @xcite .",
    "we point out that , for computational convenience , the following assumption will be made @xmath81    various limits of the equations  ( [ tf_equa1 ] ) and ( [ tf_equa2 ] ) can be considered .",
    "when @xmath82 , then one has trivially @xmath83 and the hamiltonian of the problem simply becomes @xmath84 since @xmath85 , that is a widely used spinless salpeter hamiltonian with linear confinement . in the nonrelativistic limit , an expansion in @xmath86 can be performed , and the resulting hamiltonian is @xmath87 , a schrdinger equation with linear confinement . on the contrary , if @xmath88 and if @xmath89 is defined as @xmath90 , it can be shown by a semiclassical analysis that @xmath91 at large @xmath92  @xcite .",
    "these are the well - known regge trajectories , observed in particular in light meson spectroscopy .",
    "finally , if the dynamical flux tube contribution is neglected in  ( [ tf_equa1 ] ) , one is led to the standard spinless salpeter hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath93 the corrective term @xmath94 can also be added in perturbation to take into account the dynamical contribution of the flux tube at dominant order .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath95 defines the so - called perturbative flux tube model , that has already been studied and successfully applied to describe light mesons in  @xcite .    for two - gluon glueballs , one has obviously @xmath96 with @xmath97 the gluon mass .",
    "moreover , we set @xmath98 and @xmath89 is given by  ( [ lsdef ] )",
    ".      the relativistic flux tube model can be generalized to many - body systems as follows . from the casimir scaling hypothesis , one considers that each color source generates a straight flux tube whose energy density is proportional to its quadratic color casimir operator .",
    "then , the flux tubes have to meet in one or several points such that the total energy contained in those flux tubes is minimal . in baryons for example , the junction point is called the toricelli ( or fermat or steiner ) point of the triangle made by the quarks , leading to a y - junction in agreement with lattice computations  @xcite . for multiquark states ( tetraquarks , pentaquarks ,  ) , lattice studies indicate that the confining potential is compatible with a multi y - junction flux - tube configuration  @xcite , again minimizing the total flux - tube length .",
    "the flux tubes then draw the so - called steiner tree linking the quarks and antiquarks of the system",
    ". there may be more than one steiner point in such cases : numerical algorithms exist to compute them ; see  @xcite for example .",
    "when gluons are present , the situation is different .",
    "indeed , a constituent gluon may either generate an adjoint flux tube or two fundamental ones .",
    "in the two - gluon case , lattice results favor an adjoint string linking both gluons  @xcite rather than two superimposed fundamental strings . in a three - gluon system however , recent lattice results indicate that a triangle configuration in which each gluon is linked to the two others by a fundamental flux tube is preferred to a y - junction made of adjoint strings  @xcite .",
    "this result can be understood as follows from energetic considerations .",
    "let us first consider that each gluon in a three - gluon system , located at the apices of a triangle @xmath99 , generates an adjoint flux tube , and that the flux tubes meet at a point @xmath100 .",
    "assuming the casimir scaling hypothesis , the energy contained in the y - junction is then @xmath101 .",
    "but the triangular inequality leads us to @xmath102  @xcite : the energy of a triangular configuration is energetically more favorable than the y - junction , as also suggested by the lattice study  @xcite .",
    "the energetic argument can be extended to a system made of @xmath29 gluons .",
    "let us assume that the most favored configuration of a @xmath103-gluon system is the one in which each gluon is linked to its nearest neighbors by a fundamental flux tube .",
    "we know that it is the case for @xmath104 gluons .",
    "then we choose a pair of gluons , denoted as @xmath105 and @xmath106 , that each generate an adjoint flux tube .",
    "these flux tubes meet in @xmath107 , from which a flux tube starts and connect in some way to the @xmath108 remaining gluons .",
    "@xmath107 is allowed to be in the @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , or @xmath112 color representations .",
    "the less energetic flux tube generated by @xmath107 is obtained when @xmath107 is in a color octet .",
    "consequently , @xmath107 and the @xmath108 remaining gluons are equivalent to a @xmath103-gluon system , for which the flux tube configuration is known ( closed - chain - like configuration ) .",
    "but at the same time , @xmath113 is equivalent to a three - gluon system : @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 must be connected by fundamental flux tubes .",
    "one finally concludes that the most favored configuration is the one in which @xmath107 is absent and in which a given gluon is linked to its nearest neighbors by two fundamental flux tubes . a schematic illustration of the above discussion is shown in fig .",
    "[ nglu ] .    -gluon configuration.,width=491 ]    this suggests that a relevant @xmath29-gluon lagrangian generalizing  ( [ lag1 ] ) for @xmath114 is @xmath115 with @xmath116 the resulting hamiltonian equations are quite complex , see for example  @xcite in the case of a y - junction .",
    "let us work again in the instantaneous gauge , and then neglect the contribution of the flux tubes to the momentum of the system . with this approximation one",
    "is led to the spinless salpeter hamiltonian @xmath117 it is worth saying that not only this last hamiltonian has to be considered in order to make explicit computations , but also the nontrivial symmetries of the wave function induced in the various @xmath40 channels by the color wave function ( commanding the charge conjugation ) and the pauli principle .",
    "these symmetries can become nontrivial as soon as @xmath118  @xcite .",
    "so far we have presented three different types of hamiltonians that can be used in hadronic physics .",
    "the first one is the relativistic flux tube hamiltonian  ( [ tf_equa1 ] ) , that contains the full relativistic dynamics encoded in lagrangian  ( [ lag1 ] ) , itself derived from qcd .",
    "numerical computations become simpler if one is able to deal with a closed hamiltonian ; that is why the perturbative flux tube model , defined by ( [ ssh ] ) and ( [ pft ] ) , can be used as an approximation of the full relativistic flux tube model .",
    "finally , the dynamical contribution of the flux tube may completely be neglected and the resulting hamiltonian is the spinless salpeter one  ( [ ssh ] ) .    in this section ,",
    "we compare the three frameworks in the ultrarelativistic limit , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath119 , that is the case in which the relativistic effects are the most important .",
    "it is well - known that in the case of massless particles , all those approaches lead to particular orbital ( regge ) and radial trajectories : defining @xmath120 , it is observed that @xmath121 and @xmath122 for large @xmath92 and @xmath123 respectively .",
    "notice that , in the meson case , @xmath92 is the orbital angular momentum of the system , while @xmath124 for the glueballs .",
    "let us now give a more quantitative description of that property .     versus @xmath92 for @xmath125 .",
    "a comparison is made between the results of the relativistic flux tube model ( circles ) , the perturbative flux tube model ( triangles ) , and the spinless salpeter hamiltonian ( squares ) .",
    "the linear fits  ( [ fit1])-([fit3 ] ) are also plotted .",
    "calculations are made in the ultrarelativistic limit @xmath119.,width=340 ]    the only energy scale in the massless case is @xmath126 .",
    "consequently , @xmath127 is a dimensionless quantity that can be computed numerically .",
    "our procedure is the following .",
    "thanks to the lagrange mesh method , which is a simple and accurate numerical technique , we are able to solve the relativistic flux tube model  @xcite and spinless salpeter - type hamiltonians  @xcite .",
    "then , we compute the square masses for each approach and for @xmath128 , which is enough to clearly observe the expected linear trajectories . as an example , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the @xmath125 regge trajectory computed in the three considered approaches",
    ". the linear behavior is clearly observed , but the regge slope is different in each case .",
    "fits on the complete sets of data that we have computed show that the square masses are in excellent agreement with the following linear forms : @xmath129 for the spinless salpeter hamiltonian  ( [ ssh ] ) , @xmath130 for the perturbative flux tube model  ( [ ssh])-([pft ] ) , and @xmath131 for the relativistic flux tube model  ( [ tf_equa1])-([tf_equa2 ] ) . the qualitative behavior of the mass spectrum in all those three approaches is clearly identical .",
    "that is why , even if a spinless salpeter hamiltonian is a crude approximation of the relativistic flux tube model , it can reproduce the same data provided that the parameters are correctly fitted .",
    "indeed , let us imagine that we want to reproduce the regge trajectories of light mesons . since the regge slopes ( in units of @xmath67 ) are quite different , 7.779 , 6.861 , and 6.396 for equations",
    "( [ fit1])-([fit3 ] ) , one has to choose a different value for the string tension in each case in order to agree with experiment .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the radial and regge slopes are never equal , even approximately .",
    "it turns out from the fit  ( [ fit3 ] ) that the relativistic flux tube model actually exhibits a remarkable harmonic oscillator degeneracy , with a radial slope twice as large as the regge slope .",
    "it implies in particular that , when applied to light mesons , the flux tube model alone is unable to explain the coulomb - like degeneracy that seems to be experimentally observed in the highly excited mass spectrum  @xcite .",
    "notice that the slope of radial trajectories is almost insensitive to the various approximations , while the regge slope varies significantly .",
    "this is in agreement with  @xcite , where it is shown that the relativistic flux tube model is equivalent to a spinless salpeter hamiltonian for large radial excitations .",
    "it is readily checked that the mass spectrum  ( [ fit3 ] ) corresponds not only to the relativistic flux tube model but also to the following hamiltonian @xmath132 this last hamiltonian has a nonstandard form , which actually corresponds to a closed circular flux tube of energy density @xmath133 and of radius @xmath134  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the following models lead to equivalent mass spectra : an open flux tube of energy density @xmath67 and length @xmath79 with massless particles at his ends and a closed circular flux tube of energy density @xmath135 and radius @xmath79 .",
    "such a duality is particularly interesting in the case of glueballs since both the closed- and open - flux tube approaches can be found in the literature .",
    "the open flux tube framework has the advantage of providing a common description of light mesons and glueballs  @xcite .",
    "but , it is sometimes argued that gluons in a glueball should all have the same status and not being either constituent or part of a flux tube .",
    "that is why some authors have proposed that glueballs should be described by closed fundamental flux tubes  @xcite .",
    "such a picture has also the advantage of being closer to the lattice qcd formulation , in which pure glue states are described by loops on the lattice  @xcite . in the closed flux tube approach ,",
    "the different @xmath40 states are generated by orbital or phononic excitations of the flux tube .",
    "it is worth noting that , if we set @xmath136 for the open flux tube in a glueball , @xmath135 is not far from the expected value @xmath70 .    for completeness we can quote",
    "that more exotic , knotted , configurations of the flux tubes have been suggested to be relevant in the modelization of glueballs  @xcite , and that a description of glueballs as two - dimensional spherical membranes has also been proposed in  @xcite . in this last reference ,",

    "that picture seems roughly compatible with an open- closed - flux tube duality , with the dynamics of the constituent gluon seen as an alternative way of modeling the various phononic or orbital excitations of a pure closed flux tube .",
    "however , we point out that the celebrated closed flux tube model of isgur and paton  @xcite is not in good agreement with recent lattice data when taken in its original form  @xcite",
    ". in particular , it has difficulties to reproduce the important splittings between @xmath47 and @xmath139 glueballs with the same @xmath140 .",
    "it thus appears that improvement of this model are needed in order to understand the lattice qcd glueball spectrum .",
    "the relativistic flux tube model presented in section  [ ftm ] provides us with a relativistic  although not explicitly covariant  description of hadronic bound states .",
    "supplemented by other physical mechanisms that we present hereafter , it can be used to understand the lattice data .",
    "the flux tube stands for the long - range interactions , _ i.e_. the confinement . at short distances",
    "however , other physical mechanisms become dominant .",
    "these are mainly given by the one - gluon - exchange processes between color sources .",
    "the corresponding short - range potentials can be computed from the qcd feynman diagrams at tree level or from the perturbative part of the wilson loop . in the quark - antiquark case , one",

    "this is coherent with lattice qcd calculations , showing that the static potential between a quark and an antiquark is accurately fitted by the form @xmath148  @xcite . an intuitive justification of this last relation is that the total energy of the system is separated into a dominant , nonperturbative , part ( the flux tube ) , and a residual , perturbative , part ( the one - gluon - exchange potential ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the aforementioned lattice works  @xcite , in which the potential energy between the various sources considered is always compatible with the expected one - gluon - exchange term at short distances , while the flux - tube contribution comes into play at long distances .",
    "the influence of instantons on light quarks and light mesons has been intensively studied ( see  @xcite for a complete review about instantons in qcd ) .",

    "such a term is needed to reproduce the very low value of the pion mass without lowering the masses of the other mesons .    unlike the meson case , the effects of instantons on glueballs have been less intensively studied . in a pioneering work",
    "@xcite , it has been computed that direct instantons induce a strong attractive force in the scalar glueball channel and a strong repulsive force in the pseudoscalar one , while no effect is observed in the tensor channel and presumably in the other channels .",
    "it is moreover tempting to deduce from  @xcite that these forces in the scalar and pseudoscalar channels are of equal magnitude but of opposite sign .",

    "a possible effect of sea quarks is to decrease glueball masses ( see for example ref .",

    "is found to be 15@xmath192 lower than the pure gauge mass .",
    "but no definitive conclusions can be drawn at this stage ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , in which non significant difference with the pure gauge mass is found ) .",
    "> from the results  ( [ resk ] ) , @xmath193 appears as being a glueball at 87% ; it could actually correspond to the  physical \" pseudoscalar glueball .",
    "its mass can be estimated from the kloe data .",
    "some algebra indeed shows that the following relation holds @xmath194 formula  ( [ pseudom ] ) gives the mass of the physical pseudoscalar glueball in terms of the experimentally measured mixing angle @xmath195 and the bare pseudoscalar glueball mass .",

    "using our pure gauge value @xmath198  gev , we are eventually led to suggest the existence of a pseudoscalar glueball candidate with a mass of @xmath199  gev and a total decay width around 220 - 315  mev ( we take the upper values of table  [ tab5 ] because of the repulsive instanton interactions and because the mesonic components allow for more decay processes than in the case of a bare glueball ) .",

    "this conclusion is shared by the recent works  @xcite , based on the fks formalism  @xcite , with the same experimental input as in the present study .",
    "but following  ( [ pseudom ] ) , this would imply @xmath205  gev , a value that would demand huge sea quarks effects to be reached .",
    "it is finally worth saying that there is a controversy about the kloe results  @xcite .",
    "for example , one can quote ref .",
    "@xcite , in which it is found through another analysis of radiative scalar and pseudoscalar meson decays that @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",
    "both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 resonances are compatible with a zero gluonium component in this case .",
    "notice however that more recent computations of the same author agree with a nonzero gluonic component in the @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that in the many high energy reactions with small momentum transfer , the exchange by the highest - lying regge trajectory , called as a soft pomeron , gives the dominant contribution .",
    "this exchange carries vacuum quantum numbers @xmath208 and has very peculiar properties in comparison with the usual regge pole trajectories . from the analysis of @xmath209 and",
    "@xmath210 cross sections it follows that the pomeron trajectory has a linear behavior reading  @xcite @xmath211 it is expected that such a trajectory should contain physical hadron states , with @xmath212 and @xmath213 . but the pomeron does not seem to be related to light mesons since the latter have lower intercepts and larger slopes . there has been a long - standing speculation that the physical particles on the pomeron trajectory might be glueballs . in the lattice study  @xcite , it is shown that the lightest @xmath214 pure gauge states lie on a regge trajectory that is consistent with the pomeron  ( [ pomer ] ) .",
    "however , the masses that are found in  @xcite are significantly lower than the lattice studies  @xcite on which we rely in the present approach .",
    "furthermore , in a recent calculation , meyer updated his value for the scalar and the tensor glueball masses  @xcite . although being obtained with a different method , the two new masses are , in this reference , in agreement with refs .",
    "we thus conclude that this last mass spectrum is a reliable one and that it is worth discussing a bit the compatibility of our results with the pomeron .",
    "first of all , the linearity of the trajectory  ( [ pomer ] ) is in qualitative agreement with the flux - tube picture for glueballs .",
    "the lightest glueball states with @xmath215(even@xmath216)@xmath217 are generated by the @xmath39 family . within our model",
    ", it is readily computed that the squared masses of this family , with @xmath218 running from 2 to 20 , can be fitted by the following form @xmath219 the slope of this trajectory is quite different from 0.25  gev@xmath220 ; actually we should have taken the large value @xmath221  gev@xmath157 to reproduce it .",

    "one has thus to be careful when claiming that a potential glueball model reproduces the pomeron slope : this is strongly model - dependent , and nonstandard values of the string tension can be needed to match the slopes .",
    "we also see in  ( [ doublet ] ) that the intercept is not close to 1 : our glueball trajectory thus do not correspond to the leading pomeron trajectory .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a large-@xmath218 expansion of formula  ( [ 2gma ] ) with @xmath119 gives @xmath224 the slope is nearly equal to the fitted form , while the intercept is not . with that formula",
    ", @xmath225 could agree with the pomeron trajectory ; this is a supplementary reason to consider that our glueball spectrum rather lies on a daugther trajectory .",
    "let us now quote the work  @xcite , where not only @xmath209 and @xmath210 cross sections are fitted within the pomeron framework , but also @xmath226 and @xmath227 cross sections .",
    "the following results are found : with a single ( soft ) pomeron , fits are consistent with @xmath228 with two pomerons ( soft and hard ) , fits are consistent with @xmath229 although the need for a hard pomeron is not crucial for the quality of the fits  @xcite . these results lead to a soft pomeron slope that is in better agreement with our slope , especially  ( [ soft ] ) .",
    "we can also mention that our @xmath44 mass is compatible with the point @xmath230 , while in ref .",
    "@xcite the tensor glueball is found to lie on the soft pomeron trajectory .",
    "the fit  ( [ pomer ] ) would require the tensor glueball to have a mass around 1.92  gev , while the fit  ( [ soft ] ) favors a tensor glueball mass around 1.65  gev .",
    "both are values far from our results . in conclusion ,",
    "the conjecture that the lightest ( even-@xmath218)@xmath217 glueballs lie on the pomeron trajectory is not favored by our results ; we would rather conclude that these glueballs are located on a daughter trajectory .",
    "but , we focused here in reproducing pure gauge lattice data , by computing the spectrum of genuine two - gluon states .",
    "it is plausible either that the leading pomeron trajectory contains no pure glueball but rather mixed states ( glueball , mesons , tetraquark ,  ) , or that the sea quark effects lead to a strong decrease of even the pure glue states .",
    "both mechanisms escape our current understanding .",
    "the glueball lattice spectrum , given in table  [ tab1 ] and satisfactorily reproduced by the relativistic flux tube model , was formally obtained at @xmath231 .",
    "it is well - known however that nontrivial phenomena occur at nonzero temperature .",
    "in particular , there exists a critical temperature in qcd , denoted as @xmath232 , above which deconfinement takes place , eventually leading to the celebrated quark - gluon plasma .",

    "one can think of a progressive disorganization of the chromoelectric field because of random thermal fluctuations , as illustrated in ref .",
    "that picture is supported by lattice computations of the static quark - antiquark energy , showing that the dominant effect below @xmath232 is a diminution of the effective string tension , that can be parameterized by  @xcite @xmath233 the variation of the coulomb term can be ignored in a first approach  @xcite . for completeness",
    ", we mention that a potential model describing glueballs above @xmath232 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the behavior of the glueball spectrum at finite temperature has been first investigated on the lattice in refs .",
    "the basic conclusion of those works is that the scalar glueball mass remains constant from @xmath231 to @xmath232 up to fluctuations of order 100 mev .",
    "notice that such a behavior was expected from calculations relying on effective low - energy lagrangians  @xcite .",
    "the decay width of the scalar glueball , however , has been shown to increase significantly because of thermal effects  @xcite . in the more recent work  @xcite , the pseudoscalar and tensor glueball masses",
    "are also shown to be constant from @xmath231 to @xmath232 , again up to an accuracy of 100 mev .",
    "how can those results be qualitatively explained within the relativistic flux tube model ?",
    "first , let us consider that the dominant contribution of the thermal effects is to modify the string tension according to eq .",
    "( [ aeff ] ) .",
    "second , the influence of @xmath100 on the instanton - induced effects is neglected .",
    "thus , in order to get a nearly constant scalar glueball mass , @xmath97 has to increase with @xmath100 in order to compensate the decrease of the string tension .",
    "the idea that gluons should gain a thermal mass has already been mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite for example .",
    "since no conclusion can be drawn about the form of @xmath234 , we consider it as a free parameter and compute it at various temperatures so that @xmath235 between @xmath100 and @xmath232 .",
    "the gluon masses numerically obtained are well fitted by the following form @xmath236\\ { \\rm gev}.\\ ] ]    we now turn to the thermal decay width of the scalar glueball .",
    "we gave in sec .",
    "[ decay ] a simple way to estimate the glueball decay width in the case where the decay by pair creation is the dominant mechanism . using the fitted form  ( [ glum ] ) and the formula  ( [ aeff ] ) , it can be computed that @xmath237 significantly increases from 2.850  gev@xmath238 at @xmath231 to @xmath239  gev@xmath238 at @xmath240 .",
    "however , @xmath241 quickly decreases , so that @xmath242 becomes negligible at high @xmath100 , meaning that the decay by pair creation is no longer dominant .",
    "what we have instead is a progressive  dissolution \" of the glueball in the medium , expressed by the increase of @xmath237 with @xmath100 ; such a phenomenon should contribute to increase the decay width of the glueball .",
    "moreover , since the constituent gluons become quite heavy near @xmath232 , perturbative mechanisms such as those found in heavy quarkonia might come into play .",
    "it is known for example that , because of in - medium effects , heavy quarkonia gain a thermal decay width that roughly grows like @xmath100  @xcite .",
    "again , such a mechanism could increase the glueball decay width .",
    "we can thus conclude that an increase of the glueball decay width with @xmath100 is not excluded _ a priori _ within our effective approach , but further theoretical investigations are needed to clarify and confirm that statement .    to our knowledge , no widely accepted theoretical derivation of the thermal gluon mass between @xmath100 and @xmath232 can be found in the literature so far .",
    "we have shown that the form  ( [ glum ] ) leads to the expected features for the @xmath243 state .",
    "an interesting point to mention is the following : only a state - dependent thermal mass is able to keep all the glueball spectrum constant with respect to the temperature .",
    "it can be seen from the approximate mass formula  ( [ 2gma ] ) indeed that the whole glueball spectrum will have a constant mass provided that @xmath234 is approximately given by @xmath244 @xmath245 being given by eq .",
    "( [ 2gmabis ] ) , which moreover gives an _ a posteriori _ justification of the form  ( [ glum ] ) .",
    "further lattice studies concerning the evolution of the glueball masses versus the temperature in various channels could provide more information about the thermal gluon mass . if all the glueball masses appeared to be constant , then a state - dependent gluon mass like  ( [ glum2 ] ) would be needed . on the contrary ,",
    "let us suppose that @xmath234 is state - independent , but such that the scalar gluebal has a constant mass .",
    "then , the pseudoscalar glueball will have a constant mass following our approach , since instanton - induced interactions are assumed to remain constant with the temperature , while the mass of the other glueball states will decrease with @xmath100 .",
    "indeed , the thermal mass is not large enough to balance the decrease of the string tension in that case .",
    "for example , using eq .",
    "( [ glum ] ) , we compute that the @xmath44 mass could decrease from 2.529  gev at @xmath231 to 2.326  gev at @xmath240 . for the moment , lattice data do not allow to conclude that the tensor glueball mass significantly decreases ; see  @xcite .",
    "computations with increased accuracy might be quite interesting in order to check whether that behavior is observed or not .",
    "the relativistic flux tube model has been firstly applied to compute masses and decay widths of glueballs seen as bound states of transverse constituent gluons .",
    "it allows not only to understand to qualitative features of the lattice spectrum , but leads also to a good quantitative agreement with these data .",
    "figure  [ figfin ] is a summary plot of the masses we obtain .",
    "notice a peculiar result we have found : an open flux tube with massless particles attached at his ends has the same mass spectrum than a closed flux tube with an energy density two times smaller .",
    "there exists thus a kind of duality between open- and closed- flux tube models , that draws a bridge between apparently distinct approaches existing in the literature .",
    "only a few calculations of glueball decay widths exist nowadays ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , and are mostly concerned with the scalar glueball . our framework allows to estimate the decay width in various channels , leading in particular to the conclusion that the @xmath173 resonance could be a relevant candidate for the tensor glueball . using recent kloe data concerning the gluonic content of the @xmath1 , we are able to predict a mass formula for a pseudoscalar state that is pure glueball at 87% .",
    "that state would have a mass around 2.9  gev and a decay width around 300  mev if we use the pure glueball mass computed in the present pure - glue model .",
    "but large sea - quark effects might play an important role in that sector to decrease the mass and maybe lead to identify the @xmath203 with the physical pseudoscalar glueball , as suggested in other recent works .",
    "the inclusion of sea - quark effects in effective models such as ours is actually a crucial issue for a better comparison to experimental results .",
    "we have also addressed the problem of the glueball - pomeron identification .",
    "our results suggest that the lowest - lying ( even@xmath218)@xmath217 two - gluon glueballs should no be located on the leading pomeron trajectory , but rather on a daughter trajectory .",
    "the leading trajectory could rather be associated to states with a nonzero quark - antiquark component ; such a proposal demands further and careful studies of mixing effects at the nonperturbative level to be checked .",
    "finally , we have proposed a way to include finite - temperature effects in our approach , reasonably assuming that thermal effects cause the string tension to decrease with @xmath100 .",
    "eventually the flux tube disappears at the critical temperature . currently , lattice studies suggest that the scalar glueball mass remains constant between @xmath231 and @xmath232 , while its decay width increases .",
