    "the continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) formalism was introduced four decades ago by montroll and weiss  @xcite , as a natural extension of ordinary random walks ( rws ) . in a ( one dimensional )",
    "rw you can randomly move through a fixed grid either up or down , at regular time steps , whereas in a ctrw the size of the movements and specially the time lag between them are random .",
    "ctrws have been successfully applied to a wide and diverse variety of physical phenomena over the years @xcite : transport in random media , random networks , self - organized criticality , earthquake modelling ; and recently also to finance @xcite . in this latter context , the efforts have been mostly focused on the statistical properties of the waiting time between successive transactions and the asset return at each transaction .",
    "different studies in different markets are conceiving the idea that the empirical distributions of both random variables are compatible with an asymptotic fat tail behaviour @xcite .    within the ctrw formalism",
    "we have recently investigated the mean exit time ( met ) of asset prices out of a given region for financial time series @xcite . in these articles",
    "we show that the met follows a quadratic growth in terms of the interval width , both in small and large scales .",
    "we checked the persistence of this behaviour in time series from several markets , such the foreign exchange market , or the new york stock exchange ( nyse ) .",
    "the theoretical model used in these works was based on two - state chain markovian processes .",
    "this model is able to both describe the quadratic scaling property observed for the met and provide a mechanism that can incorporate asset peculiarities through return autocorrelations .",
    "one of the possible applications of the analysis of the met in finance is in the field of risk control .",
    "there is a direct link between the value of the mean exit time out of a region , and the timescale of market fluctuations of a certain size .",
    "therefore , its value may help , for instance , in deciding the minimal time horizon for an investment , the rotation rate of a portfolio , or even the value of stop - loss and stop - limit levels for a position .",
    "however , the mean exit time is only a statistic of a distribution with even bigger interest : the survival probability ( sp ) , the probability that after some elapsed time a process remains inside the given region without having crossed its boundaries . this quantity may outperform the standard `` value at risk '' ( var ) method for two reasons :",
    "it could be based on market statistics different than the ( unrealistic ) gaussian distribution , and it will ensure ( within the desired quintile ) that the market value of the portfolio will not leave the safe zone .",
