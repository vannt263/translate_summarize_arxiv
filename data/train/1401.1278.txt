    "the graph isomorphism problem ( gi ) requires to decide whether two given graphs @xmath1 and @xmath2 are indeed the same graph but for a relabeling of the vertices . due to its practical applications ( ranging from chemistry to social sciences ) and theoretical properties ,",
    "the problem has been thoroughly studied @xcite .",
    "gi possesses peculiar features that make it an interesting candidate for an _ efficient _ quantum algorithm .",

    "the best classical general algorithm solves gi for graphs of @xmath3 vertices in time @xmath4 , were @xmath5 is a constant .",
    "+ one way to solve gi is to show that two graphs are non - isomorphic .",
    "starting from 2005 there have been different proposals of quantum algorithms based on `` non - isomorphism witnesses '' , i.e. observable quantities that assume different values only if the two input graphs are non - isomorphic .",
    "the standard benchmark for this approach is provided by the family of strongly regular graphs ( srgs ) , that includes many hard instances of gi @xcite .",
    "for example in @xcite to distinguish non isomorphic graphs the authors exploit continuous @xcite and discrete time quantum walks @xcite of one or more particles moving through the graphs and compare the evolution of the same initial condition on the two graphs . the distinguishing power of the algorithm increases with the number of walker moving along the graph ; the technique , however , is not universal and there are non - isomorphic graphs that can not be distinguished .",
    "+ a different approach , based on the adiabatic quantum computation paradigm ( aqc)@xcite , has been recently proposed in @xcite . in order to distinguish non - isomorphic graphs , for example , vinci _",
    "_ look at the values assumed by a set non - isomorphism witnesses during the adiabatic evolution of the couple of graphs under investigation .",
    "they show that their technique is able to distinguish non - isomorphic srgs up to instances of 29 vertices . on the other side ,",
    "the technique is not guaranteed against the problem that afflicts all the quantum algorithm based on the adiabatic theorem : the spectral gap of the driving hamiltonian can become exponentially small when the size of the problem increases ; consequently , it could take an exponentially long time to reach the time - region in which it is possible to distinguish non - isomorphic graphs . recently @xcite it has been shown that there is a family of observables that can be used to distinguish non - isomorphic graphs even if the `` adiabatic protocol '' is not respected and the systems under observations are subjected to some degree of noise .",
    "an interesting feature of both hen - young and vinci _ et al _ proposals is that they can be , in principle , experimentally verified on current commercial hardware ( d - wave one @xcite ) .",
    "+ in this work we propose an alternative approach to gi based on aqc . instead of looking for non - isomorphism witnesses ,",
    "the algorithm we propose solves gi by finding , if it exists , a permutation that transforms one of the two input graphs into the other .",
    "it uses a number of qubits that scales quadratically with the input size ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the configuration space is explored through a continuous - time quantum - walk of @xmath3 interacting walkers that , by construction , visits only the space of _ functions _ from @xmath7 to @xmath7 .",

    "+ we start our construction of a quantum algorithm for gi by defining a _ cost function _ @xmath24 that assigns a penalty ( positive weight ) to every permutation not belonging to @xmath23 . given the adjacency matrices @xmath25 and @xmath26 of , respectively , @xmath27 and @xmath28 and the permutation matrix @xmath29 associated to @xmath12 , the function @xmath30 counts the number of edges that are in @xmath31 but not in @xmath28 and vice versa .",

    "+ finding an assignment to the variables @xmath38 such that @xmath44 is equivalent to the problem of finding a satisfying assignment to the following boolean cnf formula : @xmath45 this is an @xmath3-sat formula .",
    "the terms in the first row of ( [ eq : sat ] ) are 2-literal clauses and depend on the input graphs ; the terms of the second row are simultaneously satisfied only if there is exactly one `` 1 '' in each row and column of the grid : the @xmath3-literals terms @xmath46 are satisfied as long as there is at least one `` 1 '' in each row , whereas the term @xmath47 is satisfied if there is at most one `` 1 '' in each column . to sum up , the second line of the formula ( [ eq : sat ] ) is evaluated to _ true _ is if the variables in the grid form a _ permutation matrix _ and the first line is _ true _ if such permutation maps one of the input graphs into the other , i.e. @xmath22 .",
    "we observe that , if we restrict the possible assignments to the variables @xmath48 to those corresponding to configurations in which there is exactly one `` 1 '' in each row of the grid , all the @xmath3-literal clauses will be automatically satisfied and the satisfaction of the formula @xmath49 alone would guarantee that the configuration of the grid corresponds to a permutation . under this assumption ,",

    "+ on the other side , we observed that , by restricting the set of possible assignments , gi can be mapped to a 2-sat formula .",
    "consider then the hamiltonian @xmath67 where @xmath68 are the spin raising and lowering operators @xmath69 .",
    "each row of the spin grid evolves independently of the others and the interactions in each chain are next - neighbors of @xmath70 type .",

    "together , the _ infra_-chain and _ infra_-column allow for the search of the solution to happen close to the space of permutations : they depend on the input size @xmath3 alone , and not on the particular instance of gi : they represent the _ hardware _ part of the algorithm .",
    "the `` geometry '' that minimizes the `` distance '' of the hardware part is that of a cylinder .",
    "+ the instance - dependent interactions connect only elements that sit on different rows and columns : they must be programmed ad - hoc ( _ software _ ) .",

    "in fact , it is zero iff the two graphs are isomorphic .",
    "+ besides , the final state of the computation carries informations on @xmath23 , even in the case the observable @xmath88 can not be measured .",

    "after @xmath3 iterations of this scheme , we will end up in a permutation state @xmath91 and it suffices to verify whether it maps @xmath27 into @xmath28 to have a definite answer .",
    "so , in the case the input graphs are not guaranteed to be rigid , we need at most a linear time overhead in order to read out the result and the overall execution time of the algorithm ( adiabatic procedure + measurement ) will scale , in the worst case , as @xmath99 , @xmath55 being the annealing time required by the first run of the adiabatic procedure .",
    "+ independently of their rigidity of the input graphs the output of the algorithm is always a permutation @xmath12 .",

    "this does not allow for a study of the spectral behavior of the algorithm as a function of the input size @xcite . by direct inspection of the spectral gap , however , it is easy to see that the `` hardness '' ( i.e. @xmath58 ) of an isomorphic instance @xmath107 , of gi may depend on @xmath12 ( see figure [ fig : aqc ] ) .     + the observation of this simple `` fact of life '' suggests the following strategy , that we christened _ permutation trick _ ( pt ) : try to solve the original instance @xmath108 .",

    "then the annealing time grows linearly from @xmath130 to @xmath127 ( but more steeply than from @xmath131 ) .",
    "+ needless to say , the reduced size of the tractable instances makes it impossible to infer anything about the behavior of the algorithm on large gi instances .",
    "the presence of `` phase transitions '' , like the one observed at @xmath132 , will most likely imply an exponential dependence of the annealing time on the input size ; the rate of such transitions , however , will determine the presence of any quantum speed - up with respect to the best classical algorithm .",

    "for the sake of self - containedness , we report here some basic definitions related to the adiabatic theorem .",
    "+ given two hamiltonian operators @xmath156 and @xmath76 on on @xmath157 , let us consider the time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath158 we indicate by @xmath159 and @xmath160 the instantaneous non - degenerate eigenvalues of @xmath161 and the corresponding eigenvectors . + the _ spectral gap _ of @xmath161 is defined as @xmath162 the adiabatic theorem asserts that , if the rescaling constant @xmath55 satisfies the relation @xmath163 , where @xmath164 then a system prepared at time @xmath165 in the ground state of @xmath166 will follow the instantaneous ground state @xmath167 of the rescaled hamiltonian @xmath168 and end up , at time @xmath169 in the ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath76 . + while the value @xmath57 can be usually bounded from above by a polynomial in the system size @xmath3 , the spectral gap @xmath58 can happen to have an exponential dependence on the system size .",
    "the preparation of the ground state of the initial hamiltonian @xmath53 ( see equation [ eq : initialham ] ) restricted to the @xmath170 sector of the hilbert space of the system can be done efficiently by adiabatic means .",
    "+ in what follows we will describe the preparation of a single chain of the system",
    ". the overall initial state will then be obtained by tensorialization .",
    "+ consider the initial state @xmath171 describing a chain with a single spin up at position @xmath172 .",
    "this is the ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath173 for any @xmath174 .",
    "+ we let the system evolve under @xmath175 where @xmath176 the annealing time depends polynomially on the system size @xmath3 .",
    "in fact the spectral gap of ( [ eq : auxham ] ) can be analytically determined by standard techniques @xcite to be , for @xmath177 the gap is monotonically decreasing in @xmath178 and reaches its minimum at @xmath179 . for @xmath179",
    "the gap is the gap of the isotropic @xmath70 on @xmath3 sites hamiltonian restricted to the single excitation subspace @xmath180 , that is @xmath181 the ground state of @xmath182 can therefore be prepared efficiently .",
    "+ we point out that while ( [ eq : hamxy ] ) is not frustration - free , it becomes such as soon as we add two localized potential .",
    "in fact the ground state of @xmath183 is the @xmath184 state @xmath185 which minimizes @xmath186 for @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "we use the world - line quantum monte - carlo algorithm to simulate the evolution of the ground - state distribution of the @xmath189 observables . for a complete account on the numerical scheme",
    ", we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the @xmath88 code used to simulate the system is available at https://bitbucket.org/luca_zanetti/qmc_gi/downloads . here",
    "we briefly describe the algorithm and define the parameters used in our simulations .",
    "+ we first discretize the time evolution . instead of interpolating between @xmath53 ( [ eq : initialhamprime ] ) and @xmath52 ( [ eq : hf ] ) by continuously varying the parameter @xmath190 ( see ( [ eq : adiabatic ] ) ) , we take an integer _ evolution time _ @xmath55 and change the time - dependent system hamiltonian through unit steps from 0 to @xmath55 .",
    "+ we approximate the evolution of the instantaneous ground state @xmath191 of the system between two interpolation steps @xmath135 and @xmath192 via the suzuki - trotter replica method : @xmath193 replicas of the system are evolved through @xmath194 metropolis moves toward the equilibrium distribution of @xmath195 at temperature @xmath196 . in our experimental campaign that the best results are obtained if we set @xmath197 .",
    "+ the algorithm can be synthesized as follows : +        the thermal - annealing procedure is used to reproduce the equilibrium distribution of @xmath199 of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : initialhamprime ] ) .",
    "the iterations over @xmath202 implement the permutation trick .",
    "the iterations over @xmath203 capture the non - deterministic nature of mc .",
    "+ since @xmath204 the thermal state will have a support larger than the sole ground state .",
    "besides , the allowed number of metropolis moves does not guarantee that the replicas equilibrate @xcite . for these reasons ,",
    "we say that the qmc procedure succeeds in finding a solution of an instance of gi when , at the final time @xmath55 , @xmath205 of the replicas are in a configuration corresponding to a solution of the given instance . in this way we are able to capture the approximate nature of the solutions provided by the qmc numerical scheme , while ruling out the possibility of finding a solution by mere chance . + in our simulations the parameters have been set to : @xmath206 ."
