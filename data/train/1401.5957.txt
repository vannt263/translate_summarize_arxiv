    "recent interest in complex systems , such as social networks , the world - wide - web , email networks and mobile phone networks @xcite , has led researchers to investigate the processes that may explain the dynamics of human behaviour within these networks . for example , barabsi @xcite suggested that the bursty nature of human behaviour , for example when measuring the inter - event response time of email communication , is a result of a decision - based queuing process .",
    "in particular , humans tend to prioritise actions , for example when deciding which email to respond to , and therefore a priority queue model was proposed in @xcite , leading to a heavy - tailed power - law distribution of inter - event times .",
    "the tail of a power - law distribution decays polynomially in contrast to the exponential decay characteristic of the gaussian distribution , which is why it is also referred to as a heavy - tailed distribution .",
    "power - law _",
    "distribution takes the general form @xmath0 representing the proportion of observations having the value @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are positive constants ; we call @xmath3 the _ exponent _ of the distribution @xcite",
    ".    survival analysis @xcite provides statistical methods to estimate the time until an event will occur , known as the _ survival time_. typically , an event in a survival model is referred to as a _ failure _ , as it often has negative connotations , such as death or the contraction of a disease , although it could also be positive , such as the time to return to work or to recover from a disease . in the context of email communication",
    "mentioned above , an event might be a reply to an email .",
    "traditional applications of survival analysis are in clinical trials @xcite , and reliability engineering @xcite , the analogue of survival analysis for mechanical systems .",
    "however , one can envisage that survival analysis would find application in newer human dynamics scenarios in complex systems , such as those arising in social and communication networks @xcite .    of particular interest to us has been the formulation of a _ generative model _ in the form of a stochastic process by which a complex system evolves and gives rise to a power law or other distribution @xcite .",
    "this type of research builds on the early work of simon @xcite , and the more recent work of barabsi s group @xcite and other researchers @xcite . in the context of human dynamics , the priority queue model @xcite mentioned above is a generative model characterised by a heavy - tailed distribution . in the bigger picture , one can view the goal of such research as being similar to that of _ social mechanisms _",
    "@xcite , which looks into the processes , or mechanisms , that can explain observed social phenomena .",
    "using an example given in @xcite , the growth in the sales of a book can be explained by the well - known logistic growth model @xcite .",
    "the motivation of this paper is in the formulation of a simple generative model that will capture the essential dynamics of survival analysis applications . for this purpose",
    ", we make use of an urn - based stochastic model , where the actors are called _ balls _ , and a ball being present in @xmath4 , the @xmath1th urn , indicates that the actor represented by the ball has so far survived for @xmath1 time steps .",
    "an actor could , for example , be a subject in a clinical trial or an email that has not yet been replied to . as a simplification ,",
    "we assume that time is discrete and that , at any given time , one ball may join the system with a fixed probability . as a result , at any given time ,",
    "say @xmath5 , we may have at most one ball in @xmath4 , for all @xmath6 . alternatively , with a fixed probability , an existing ball in the system may be chosen uniformly at random and discarded .",
    "we note that at any time @xmath5 , if @xmath7 , the probability that @xmath4 is empty is less than the probability that @xmath8 is empty , as a ball in @xmath8 could have been discarded at any of the previous @xmath9 time steps , whereas a ball in @xmath4 could have only been discarded at any of the previous @xmath1 time steps , and a ball to be discarded is chosen uniformly .",
    "this mechanism can be contrasted with the preferential attachment rule in evolving networks @xcite ( also known as the `` rich get richer '' phenomenon @xcite ) , where the probability of adding a new link to a node ( or actor ) is proportional to the number of existing links that the node already has . in our case , actors are chosen uniformly rather than preferentially ; however , the model keeps a record of the time for which an actor has survived so for .",
    "our main result is to derive a power - law distribution for the probability that , after @xmath5 steps of the stochastic process outlined above , there is a surviving ball in @xmath4 , where @xmath6 .",
    "thus , in our model , the _ survivor function _",
    "@xcite , which gives the probability that a patient ( in our model a ball ) survives for more than a given time , can be approximated by a power - law distribution .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the resulting distribution has two parameters , @xmath1 and @xmath5 , as in @xcite , whereas most previously studied generative stochastic models @xcite , including those in our previous work @xcite , result in steady state distributions that are asymptotic in @xmath5 to a distribution with a single parameter @xmath1 . as a proof of concept",
    ", we demonstrate the validity of our model by analysing two well - known data sets from the survival analysis literature @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "urn ] , we present our stochastic urn - based model that provides us with a mechanism to model the essential dynamics of survival models , and we derive the resulting power - law distribution . in section",
    "[ sec : survival ] , we apply our generative model to two well - known data sets from survival analysis , and finally , in section  [ sec : conc ] , we give our concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we formalise our stochastic urn model for modelling the dynamic aspects of a time - varying system and present an approximate solution to the mean field equations describing the model .",
    "we assume a countable number of urns , @xmath10 . initially all the urns are empty except @xmath11 , which has one ball in it .",
    "let @xmath12 be 1 or 0 , respectively , according to whether or not there is a ball in @xmath4 at time @xmath5 of the stochastic process .",
    "initially we set @xmath13 , and for all other urns @xmath14 .",
    "the _ age _ of a ball in @xmath4 is defined to be @xmath1 .",
    "then , at time @xmath15 of the stochastic process , where @xmath16 , one of two things may occur :    1 .   with probability @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , a new ball is put into @xmath11 ( i.e its initial age",
    "is 1 ) , or 2 .   with probability @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , an urn is selected , with @xmath4 being selected with probability proportional to @xmath12 , i.e. one of the non - empty urns is selected uniformly at random , and the ball in the selected urn",
    "is discarded .",
    "next , the age of all balls remaining in the system , apart from a new ball that may have just been put into @xmath11 during this time step , is incremented by 1 , i.e. any ball in @xmath4 is moved to @xmath21 for each @xmath1 .",
    "we observe that , in this model , @xmath12 is equal to either 1 or 0 , since at most one new ball is generated at time @xmath5 and the age of all other balls increases by one at time @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , it can be seen that , at any given time @xmath22 , the probability of there being a ball in @xmath11 is @xmath17 .",
    "we constrain the system so that on average more balls are added to the system than are discarded , i.e @xmath23 otherwise the system would almost surely degenerate into a state of emptiness , i.e. having no balls in the system .",
    "this constraint is an instance of the gambler s ruin problem @xcite , from which it follows that the probability that the urn transfer process will _ not _ terminate with all the urns being empty is strictly positive @xcite .",
    "now let @xmath24 . as @xmath12 is either @xmath25 or @xmath26 ,",
    "this expectation is equal to the probability that there is a ball in @xmath4 at time @xmath5 ; so @xmath27 .",
    "so , the expected total age of the balls in the system for large @xmath5 is @xmath28    let @xmath29 , then @xmath30 is the expected number of balls in the system at time @xmath5 . for sufficiently large @xmath5",
    ", we obtain the following simple bounds on the expected total age of the balls , @xmath31 so it follows , on dividing by @xmath30 , that the average age of a ball is proportional to @xmath5 . to obtain the lower bound in ( [ eq : ifi ] ) , we assume that the @xmath30 balls in the system are as young as possible ; conversely , to obtain the upper bound , we assume that they are as old as possible .",
    "following @xcite , we now state the mean field equations for the urn transfer model . at time @xmath22 , for @xmath32 we have @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the probability of choosing any particular non - empty urn in step ( ii ) at time @xmath5 ; this is given by @xmath35 since @xmath30 is the expected number of balls in the system at time @xmath5 .",
    "in the boundary case , when @xmath36 , we have @xmath37    we can now rewrite ( [ eq : a1 ] ) as @xmath38 where @xmath39    note that , when @xmath40 , we have @xmath41",
    ". we can solve equations ( [ eq : p ] ) and ( [ eq : a3 ] ) directly , obtaining @xmath42    we first rewrite ( [ eq : a4 ] ) as @xmath43    finally , rewriting ( [ eq : a4 ] ) in terms of the gamma function @xmath44 @xcite , we obtain @xmath45    making use of the limit ( see @xcite ) , @xmath46 = 1,\\ ] ] @xmath47 can be approximated by @xmath48 provided @xmath49 is `` large '' , more specifically that @xmath50 as @xmath51 .    now let @xmath52 be a slowly increasing function of @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath53 as @xmath51 , for example , @xmath54 .",
    "then ( [ eq : a7 ] ) holds provided @xmath55 . since , from ( [ eq : a5 ] ) , it follows that @xmath56 is strictly monotonically decreasing in @xmath1 , when @xmath57 , we have @xmath58    it follows that the expected number of balls @xmath59 in urns for which ( [ eq : a7 ] ) may not hold , i.e. in the tail defined by @xmath60 , is bounded above by @xmath61    by approximating the sums by integrals , it is not difficult to show that the approximation to @xmath56 in ( [ eq : a7 ] ) satisfies @xmath62    these are consistent with the expected number of balls being @xmath30 and the bounds on the expected total age of the balls in ( [ eq : ifi ] ) .    in survival analysis",
    ", briefly described in the next section , we are often interested in the _ survivor function _",
    "@xcite , which gives the probability that a patient in a given study survives for longer than a specified time @xmath64 .",
    "the survivor function is usually estimated via a step function by computing the probability that a patient survives until time @xmath64 , for @xmath65 .",
    "this step function is known as the _ kaplan - meier estimator _ @xcite . by comparing ( [ eq : a4 ] ) and",
    "the kaplan - meier estimate for the survivor function ( * ? ? ? * equation  ( 2b ) ) , this estimate is seen to be analogous to @xmath56 for an actor that was born at time @xmath49 ; more specifically , we can approximate @xmath66 by @xmath67 .",
    "we note that although in theory the survivor function @xmath63 does not depend on the length @xmath5 of the trial , in practice the kaplan - meier estimate will be more accurate for longer trials .",
    "however , the kaplan - meier estimate is most accurate when most of the patients are still present in the study , since , when there are only a few patients left , the estimate may be inaccurate @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with our approximation of @xmath56 , which holds when @xmath49 is large .",
    "the kaplan - meier estimator also takes into account _ censored _ data @xcite , when , for example , a patient drops out before the end of the study period .",
    "although our evolutionary urn transfer model does not include censoring , it could be incorporated by allowing the possibility that when a ball is removed from an urn it is not necessarily counted as being discarded .",
    "we further note that , while in traditional survivor models patients join a study in batches , in our model individual balls continue to join the system with a fixed probability .",
    "our model could be generalised to allow several balls to join the system at any given time , and also by letting the arrival probability @xmath17 depend on @xmath5 ; we leave consideration of such enhancements for future work .",
    "survival analysis is well established within the statistics community , dealing with the analysis of _ time - to - event _ data @xcite .",
    "for example , in clinical trials , one is monitoring patients and how likely they are to survive or to respond to a treatment within a given time frame .    in our model ,",
    "the objects being monitored are represented by balls and they are considered to have survived for as long as they remain in the system . the death event is modelled by discarding a ball , and the arrival event is modelled by putting a new ball into the first urn .",
    "our stochastic model has three input parameters : the arrival rate @xmath17 , the death rate @xmath68 , and the time @xmath5 at which the system is observed .",
    "given these parameters , the survival probability of a ball in @xmath4 at time @xmath5 , where @xmath6 , is approximated by @xmath56 as given by ( [ eq : a7 ] ) .",
    "in other words , given @xmath5 , @xmath56 is the probability that a ball that enters the system at time @xmath49 survives for at least @xmath1 steps before it is discarded .    as a proof of concept , we make use of two well - known data sets from survival analysis : ( i ) the _ vets _ data set @xcite , which contains the survival times in days for 137 lung cancer patients from the veteran s administration lung cancer trial , and ( ii ) the _ addicts _ data set @xcite , which contains the times in days spent by 238 heroin addicts in one of two methadone clinics . the longest non - censored actor survived for 999 days for the vets data and for 899 days for the addicts data .",
    "moreover , the last censored actor was at 231 days for the vets data and at 1076 days for the addicts data .",
    "we first computed the kaplan - meier curves from the raw vets and addicts data sets .",
    "then , recalling that we approximate the survivor function @xmath66 by @xmath67 , using matlab , we derived @xmath17 and @xmath69 using non - linear least squares regression on the kaplan - meier curves , assuming the distribution for @xmath56 given in ( [ eq : a7 ] ) . to obtain consistency for @xmath56 ,",
    "the approximate survivor function @xmath66 was multiplied by an estimate of @xmath17 , which was computed as the ratio of the number of actors to the number of days of the trial ; for the vets data set this estimate was @xmath70 and for the addicts data it was @xmath71 .",
    "the values for @xmath17 , @xmath69 and @xmath72 that we obtained , together with the coefficient of determination @xmath73 @xcite , are shown in the rows of table  [ table : kappa ] captioned _ vets data _ and _ addicts data_.    to test the validity of the model , we then carried out simulations in matlab of the stochastic urn transfer model using the values of @xmath17 and @xmath69 obtained from the above regression .",
    "the simulations for the vets data set was run for 1000 steps and for the addicts data for 900 steps , and these were repeated one million times .",
    "we then calculated the average value of @xmath56 for @xmath74 , over the one million runs .",
    "we obtained new values for @xmath17 and @xmath72 using non - linear regression on the resulting averaged data set , assuming the distribution in ( [ eq : a7 ] ) .",
    "we then computed @xmath69 from @xmath17 and @xmath72 using ( [ eq : kappa ] ) .",
    "these values are shown in the rows of table  [ table : kappa ] captioned _ vets sim _ and _ addicts sim _ , together with the @xmath73 values .",
    "it can be seen that the values of @xmath17 and @xmath69 from the simulation closely match their counterparts obtained directly from the raw data .",
    "the @xmath72 values are also close , although we note that @xmath72 is quite sensitive to small changes in the values of @xmath17 and @xmath69 .",
    "we also show the expected number of balls in the tail @xmath59 , given by ( [ eq : a8 ] ) , where @xmath54 .",
    "the tail for the addicts data is much larger than that for the vets data , although , even in this latter case , the expected fraction of balls in the tail is less than @xmath75 .",
    "the kaplan - meier curve from the raw data and the fitted regression curve from the model are shown in figure [ fig : vets ] for the vets data and in figure [ fig : addicts ] for the addicts data .",
    ".[table : kappa ] values for @xmath17 and @xmath69 fitted from the data and recovered from the simulations .

    "we have proposed a stochastic evolutionary urn model for survival analysis applications in the context of human dynamics . in our model , actors ( represented by balls ) remain in the system and survive until they die ( i.e. are discarded ) . at any given time step",
    "each actor currently in the system is equally likely to be discarded , although in practice there may be many other factors that influence the survival of an actor .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : a7 ] ) exhibits the power law in @xmath76 , the proportion of the total time period before the actor joined the system . despite the simplicity of our model ,",
    "the results we have presented provide preliminary evidence for its validity , although further validation and possible enhancements to the model , as indicated at the end of section  [ sec : urn ] , would be desirable .",
    "generative models , such as the one we have presented , have the potential to explain observed social phenomena and , in this context , social mechanisms , as discussed in the introduction .",
