    "nonlinear metamaterials ( nmm ) are rapidly developing fields extending the concepts of metamaterials as well as nonlinear optics .",
    "nmm are interesting because of their extraordinary properties compared with natural nonlinear materials , including , among others , enhanced nonlinearity due to resonance @xcite , novel phase - matching condition due to negative refractive index @xcite .",
    "generally , nmm are inherently nonlinear lattices driven by external light radiation with subwavelength lattice constants . under weak radiation",
    ", the responses of the lattice should be approximately described by the linear optics with appropriate modifications coming from nonlinearity . in this regime ,",
    "low - order nonlinear coefficients in taylor expansions as for natural nonlinear materials would be an appropriate description .",
    "many recent papers work in this weak radiation regime @xcite .",
    "when radiation becomes stronger but not strong enough to damage the building materials of meta - atoms , in some cases @xcite there may exist a scale of radiation intensity in / above which the lattice has such complex responses due to modulational instability that it can hardly be described by uniform optical constants ( e.g. , linear and/or nonlinear refractive index ) . that scale is characterized by the possible existence of bistability under uniform assumption regardless of the modulational instability for the case in @xcite .",
    "full - wave numerical simulations @xcite of the structures in a bistability proposal @xcite and the results for a similar nonlinear system @xcite support that the bistability based on uniform assumption may be disturbed by modulational instability . in this paper",
    "we will study modulational instability for a different kind of nmm , magneto - elastic metamaterials ( mem ) .",
    "recently a new kind of metamaterials called mem are proposed @xcite presenting nonlinearity arising from mechanic interactions among individual meta - atoms . in the sections below",
    ", we will first establish an effective circuit dynamic model for mem and then investigate the properties , especially modulational instability , of four cases : ( i ) a dimer of split - ring resonators ( srr ) ; ( ii ) a one - dimension ( 1d ) dimerized array or an array of dimers ; ( iii ) a 1d uniform array of srr or a 1d polymer ; ( iv ) layers two - dimension ( 2d ) srr array .",
    "we find that except for the first case all the other three many - body cases can present modulational instability above an radiation intensity threshold , which can inevitably disturb the bistability ( if any ) under uniform assumption .",
    "a simple model based on effective circuit is developed in this section for an srr dimer and generalized for the other many - body cases in the following sections .",
    "linear stability analysis indicates that modulational instability can not occur for an srr dimer .    as proposed in @xcite , an mem",
    "is composed of srr which can deviate from their original positions due to the magnetic dipole forces from their neighbors but subject to respective mechanic restoring forces .",
    "the consequence of the changing of positions is that the mutual inductance among neighbor srr can thus be affected , rendering a feedback mechanism of the electromagnetic response of mem , another way of saying nonlinearity . for the simplest case , two interacting srr sharing the same central axis , we model the srr as effective lcr circuits and further assume that the mechanic resonance due to the restoring force and the magnetic resonance of the lcr circuit are decoupled , i.e.",
    ", the frequency of the latter is much larger than that of the former , and also that the damping of the mechanic oscillation is very fast compared to the varying rate of envelope of magnetic response . in other words ,",
    "the balanced position of each srr can simply be determined by the averaged magnetic forces ( related to the envelope of magnetic response ) it experiences and the restoring force coefficients .",

    "we should investigate the modulational instability of the uniform stationary states in eq.([10 ] ) . before we do linear stability analysis for the uniform equation ( [ 10 ] ) , we want to point out that the stationary equations ( [ 9 ] ) without making uniform assumption do not have nonuniform solutions , ) to verify this observation . ] implying no modulational instability could occur for a dimer .",
    "linear stability analysis in appendix [ b ] also confirms this speculation .",
    "since a dimer can only have uniform response , it will be convenient to treat it as a unit nonlinear element rather than two srr .",
    "a question is : can modulational instability occur when an array of dimers are arranged along a line sharing the same central axis ( or plane ) , i.e. , for a 1d dimerized srr array which models the experimental structures in fig.5 of @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we investigate the modulational instability of such an array .",

    "the main simplifications are nearest - neighbor approximations , slowly - varying approximations , and taylor approximations for mutual inductances and magnetic forces .",
    "the the main deviation of these approximations from the model in @xcite is that the former gives simple bistability of uniform responses as shown below while the the latter gives a more complicated one .",
