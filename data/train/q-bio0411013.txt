    "well - known examples of biological networks include metabolic reaction , protein - protein interaction and gene transcription regulatory networks ( gtrns ) @xcite .",
    "the availability of large scale experimental data and powerful computational tools provide information on the structural and functional features of the complex networks . in the case of a gtrn , the nodes of the network represent genes and two nodes are connected by a directed link if the protein product of one gene regulates the synthesis of proteins from the other gene .",
    "existing databases on simple organisms like _ e. coli _ and _ s. cerevisiae _ show that the gtrns of these organisms have common structural motifs like bi - fan , single input module ( sim ) and feed forward loop ( ffl ) @xcite .",
    "such motifs are more abundant in the naturally occurring networks than in their randomized counterparts , highlighting the essential roles of motifs in network function .",
    "the regulatory and other biochemical processes associated with a gtrn are probabilistic in nature giving rise to fluctuations in the levels of proteins synthesized by different genes .",
    "the magnitude of noise can not be neglected when the number of biomolecules participating in the network processes is small .",
    "recently , several theoretical @xcite as well as experimental @xcite studies have been carried out on the origins and consequences of stochasticity and the dependence of noise on some important parameters of gene expression ( ge ) like the transcription and translation rates .",
    "the effect of stochasticity may be both advantageous and disadvantageous .",
    "stochasticity can give rise to phenotypic variations in an identical population of cells kept in the same environment .",
    "it thus plays a positive role in situations where phenotypic diversity is beneficial . in most cases , however , stochasticity acts to diminish fidelity in cellular processes . noisy regulatory signals , for example , may not achieve the desired outcome introducing uncertainty in cellular behaviour .",
    "fraser et al .",
    "@xcite have recently addressed the important issue of the relation of noise to the fitness of an organism .",
    "they estimate the noise in protein production for almost all the genes in _",
    "s. cerevisiae _ and show that the amount of noise associated with protein levels in the steady state has lower magnitude in the cases of essential genes and genes encoding subunits of multi - protein complexes .",
    "fluctuations in the protein levels of these functionally important classes of genes are particularly detrimental to organismal fitness because of reduced functionality .",
    "the lower amounts of noise associated with the genes support the hypothesis that noise is an evolvable trait acted on by natural selection . in this paper",
    ", we consider a simple stochastic model of ge to determine the noise characteristics of a particular type of motif appearing in gtrns , namely , the ffl @xcite . a ffl is a three - node motif describing three genes @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the protein @xmath3 produced from gene @xmath0 regulates protein synthesis from gene @xmath1 .",
    "proteins @xmath3 and @xmath4 also jointly regulate the expression of gene @xmath2 .",
    "inducer molecules @xmath6 and @xmath7 are in general required to activate or inhibit the function of protein molecules @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "there are three transcriptional regulatory interactions in a ffl , each of which can have either positive ( activation ) or negative ( repression ) sign .",
    "the motif with three links can be in eight possible configurations which fall into two categories : coherent and incoherent ( figure 1 ) . in a coherent ffl ,",
    "the sign of the direct regulation path from @xmath0 to @xmath2 is the same as the overall sign of the indirect regulation path via @xmath1 .",
    "there are four such configurations . in the other four configurations ,",
    "termed incoherent ffls , the signs of the direct and indirect regulation paths are opposite . the two protein inputs @xmath3 and",
    "@xmath4 regulate the target gene @xmath2 through either an and - gate or an or - gate . in the first case ,",
    "both @xmath3 and @xmath4 proteins are needed to regulate gene @xmath2 and in the second case , either @xmath3 or @xmath4 protein is sufficient for the regulation of @xmath2 .",
    "the functionality of the different types of ffls has been determined using a simple mathematical analysis based on the deterministic rate equation approach @xcite .",
    "the coherent ffl is found to serve as a sign - sensitive delay element .",
    "consider the type-1 coherent ffl with and - gate regulation and a step - like pulse of @xmath3 proteins as the input stimulus ( signal ) .",
    "expression of gene @xmath2 can only begin when the level of @xmath4 proteins is sufficient to cross the activation threshold for @xmath2 .",
    "the response time is a measure of the speed of response and is given by the time taken for the @xmath5 proteins to reach an amount which is half the steady state level .",
    "sign - sensitive delay implies that the response time to step - like stimuli is asymmetric , i.e , the response time is delayed in one direction ( pulse off to on ) and rapid in the other direction ( on to off ) . as a result ,",
    "if the activation of the @xmath0 gene is transient , the @xmath2 gene can not be significantly activated , i.e , the input signal is not transduced through the ffl .",
    "the @xmath5 proteins are synthesized only when the @xmath0 gene is activated for a sufficiently long time interval .",
    "the @xmath2 gene switches off rapidly once the @xmath0 gene is deactivated .",
    "in other words , the coherent ffl functions as a persistence detector , responding only to a persistent stimulus and filtering out fluctuations in the input signal .",
    "the role of the coherent ffl as sign - sensitive delay has been verified experimentally @xcite .",
    "the incoherent ffls function as sign - sensitive accelerators speeding up the response time in one direction ( off to on in the stimulus step ) but not in the other direction ( on to off ) .",

    "we show that the most abundant coherent ffl , namely , the type-1 ffl , is the least noisy .",
    "this is , however , not true in the case of the incoherent ffls .",
    "the lower number of ffls has been ascribed to their reduced functionality @xcite .",

    "figure 4 shows plots for the total variances around the mean protein level @xmath135 when the input noise @xmath84 is higher than that in the cases of figures 2 and 3 .",

    "the dominant contribution to @xmath87 is from the internal noise associated with the expression of the @xmath2 gene .",
    "fluctuations in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 protein levels have little effect on the total noise . in the case of the type-4 ffl , the extrinsic contribution to noise is greater than that in the case of the type-1 ffl . in short ,",
    "figures 2 and 4 show that the type-1 ffl acts as a better filter of noise .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , one possible function of coherent ffls is as a persistent detector or equivalently as a filter which attenuates the input noise .",
    "the type-1 coherent ffl being less noisy than the type-4 coherent ffl , functions better as a noise filter .",
    "the reduced functionality of the type-4 coherent ffl explains its lower abundance from an evolutionary point of view .",
    "similar reasoning holds true for type-2 and type-3 coherent ffls .",
    "thus for coherent ffls , noise is disadvantageous as it erodes the function of a ffl as a persistent detector . for incoherent ffls ,",
    "functioning as sign - sensitive accelerators , noise appears to have no direct relationship with abundance , i.e , noise is not detrimental to the functioning of the ffls .",
    "our analysis of the noise characteristics of ffls is based on the langevin formalism which is approximate in nature . to establish the validity of the results , we have calculated the variances using monte carlo simulation based on the ga @xcite .",
    "the ga provides a numerical solution of the master equation leading to an accurate description of the time course of evolution of a stochastic system .",
    "a brief description of the ga is as follows .",
    "consider n chemical species participating in m chemical reactions .",

    "given the values of @xmath139 , @xmath141 at time t , the ga is designed to answer two questions : ( 1 ) when will the next reaction occur ? and",
    "( 2 ) what type of reaction will it be ? let the next reaction occur at time @xmath142 .",
    "knowing the type of reaction , one can adjust the numbers of participating molecules in accordance with the specific reaction scheme .",
    "thus , with repeated applications of the ga , one can keep track of how the numbers , @xmath139 s , change as a function of time due to the occurrence of @xmath143 different types of chemical reactions .",
    "each reaction @xmath144 ( @xmath145 ) has a stochastic rate constants @xmath146 associated with it .",

    "other possibilities like the operator region unoccupied or occupied by a single dimer are considered but the gene remains in the inactive state in these cases .",
    "the stochastic rate constants @xmath146 s are equal to the rate constants @xmath153 s since in the deterministic approach the numbers and not the concentrations of the different molecules are considered .",
    "figure 5(b ) and 6(b ) show the histograms describing the distribution of protein levels , @xmath154 versus @xmath5 , for the coherent type-1 and type-4 ffls respectively .",
    "the histograms have been obtained by accumulating data over 5000 trial runs .",
    "the distribution is broader in the case of the type-4 coherent ffl indicating that it is more noisy than the type-1 ffl .",
    "the variances for type-1 and type-4 distributions are 110.612 and 329.990 respectively .",
    "the simulation results support the results obtained by using the langevin formalism that the type-4 coherent ffl is more noisy than the type-1 coherent ffl .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the noise characteristics of coherent and incoherent ffls using the langevin formalism as well as a numerical simulation technique based on the gillespie algorithm .",
    "noise is undesirable if it affects operational reliability .",

    "the coherent type-1 ffl is the most abundant of ffl motifs appearing in the gtrns of simple organisms .",
    "the functional superiority of the type-1 ffl , amongst the four coherent ffls , is the main reason why the particular motif is favoured by natural selection .",
    "mangan and alon @xcite have speculated that increased effective cooperativity of the type-1 ffl might be responsible for its evolutionary advantage .",
    "thattai and van oudenaarden @xcite have shown that increased cooperativity leads to noise reduction .",
    "this possibly explains why the type-1 coherent ffl has less output noise than the other coherent ffls . for the incoherent ffls , no clear conclusion regarding the role of noise",
    "can be arrived at as concrete results are lacking .",
    "noise may be advantageous to function in certain cases .",
    "stochastic resonance is a phenomena in which noise in threshold systems facilitates detection of subthreshold signals @xcite . in stochastic",
    "focusing , fluctuations ( noise ) sharpen the response to an input signal , i.e , make a graded response mechanism work more like a threshold one @xcite .",
    "further studies are needed to ascertain whether noise aids the function of incoherent ffls in some manner similar to stochastic focusing .",
    "if this is true , then the most abundant motif need not be the least noisy .",
    "regulatory cascades of which the ffl is a special case can exhibit interesting kinetic phenomena which include even transient ones like pulse generation @xcite",
    ". it will be of considerable interest to determine the effect of noise on such phenomena .",
    "fraser et al .",
    "@xcite have addressed the question of whether noise associated with ge has any significant effect on the fitness of an organism .",
    "they have estimated the noise in protein production of almost all the _ s. cerevisiae _ genes using an experimentally verified model of stochastic ge .",
    "their major finding is that noise is minimized in the cases of genes for which it is likely to be most harmful .",
    "these genes include essential genes , i.e , genes whose deletion is lethal to the organism and genes which synthesize the subunits of multi - protein complexes .",
    "both types of genes are expected to be sensitive to noise .",
    "for essential genes , fluctuations in protein levels may have considerable effect on functional viability if the levels fall below the threshold required for normal cellular activity .",
    "similarly , in the case of a multy - protein complex , fluctuations in the amounts of protein subunits may hinder the appropriate assembly of the entire complex .",
    "the observations of fraser et al .",
    "are in agreement with our results on coherent ffls . since noise has a deleterious effect on the function of a coherent ffl as a persistence detector , it is minimized in the case of the best performing type-1 ffl .",
