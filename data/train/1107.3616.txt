    "millimeter and submillimeter observations of dense cores in nearby parsec - scale cluster - forming clumps have shown that the core mass function ( cmf ) resembles the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "for example , @xcite performed 1.2 mm continuum observations toward l1688 and identified 57 starless dense cores whose mass function ( @xmath0 ) is consistent with the salpeter power - law imf at the high mass end ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the cmf also has a break at about 0.3 m@xmath2 , below which it flattens to @xmath3 .",
    "other authors have found similar cmfs in the region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the shape of the cmf is broadly consistent with the imf of class ii ysos in the same region @xcite .",
    "another example is the serpens cloud core , where @xcite identified , through 3 mm continuum interferometric observations , 32 dense cores whose mass function can be fitted by a power - law of @xmath4 , again consistent with the salpeter imf . these and other observations suggest that the identified dense cores may be the direct progenitors of individual stars and the bulk of the stellar imf may be at least partly determined by cloud fragmentation in the parsec - scale dense clumps .",
    "thus , understanding the formation process of dense cores is a key step towards a full understanding of how stars form .",
    "both supersonic turbulence and magnetic fields are expected to play a role in clustered star formation .",
    "the relative importance of the two is still under debated , however .",
    "one school of thought is that the core ( and thus star ) formation in a cluster - forming clump is mainly regulated by supersonic turbulence . in this scenario ,",
    "star formation is completed rapidly , before the initial supersonic turbulence has decayed significantly ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "magnetic fields are less important in this picture , although @xcite argued that a weak magnetic field is still needed in order to produce a core mass spectrum that resembles the stellar imf .",
    "the weak magnetic field is expected to be strongly tangled by the supersonic turbulence . ordered field structures , if present at all , are typically attributed to large - scale compression and are expected to be parallel to the dense filaments that are also produced by the same compression ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the second school of thought envisions a magnetic field that is more dynamically important ; it prevents stars from forming too rapidly . because supersonic turbulence dissipates rapidly ,",
    "it must be somehow replenished . in a cluster - forming clump",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "because the matter moves preferentially along the dynamically important magnetic field , the field is expected to be more or less perpendicular to the dense filaments that are created by either turbulence compression or self - gravity .",
    "a goal of this paper is to quantify the effects of the magnetic field on the clustered star formation in general , and the properties of dense cores in particular , through 3d mhd simulations that include outflow feedback for turbulence replenishment .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "model ] , we describe the numerical method and simulation setup . in section [ sec : results ] , we apply a version of the so - called `` clumpfind '' algorithm to identify dense cores in a parent dense clump and derive their properties .",

    "our main conclusions are summarized in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the initial and boundary conditions of the simulations are essentially the same as those of @xcite .",

    "is solved using the fast fourier transform .",
    "our simulation has a resolution of @xmath48 .",
    "although our focus is on core properties , we do include a crude treatment of the formed stars and outflows , following @xcite ; we refer the reader to that paper for details .",
    "briefly , when the density in a cell crosses the threshold @xmath49 , corresponding to @xmath50 @xmath13 , we create a lagrangian particle at the cell center .",
    "we extract mass from a small region surrounding the cell , and put it on the particle , which moves with mass - weighted mean velocity of the extracted mass ( see nakamura & li 2007 for more detail ) .",
    "after creation , the particle is allowed to accrete from the surrounding gas according to the same prescription as @xcite . to mimic the effect of protostellar outflows , the particle injects into the ambient gas a momentum that is proportional to the particle mass increment @xmath51 .",
    "the outflow momentum is scaled with the dimensionless outflow parameter @xmath52 as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the wind velocity ( see the appendix of * ? ? ?",
    "the fiducial value of @xmath52 is set to 0.4 , consistent with @xcite .",
    "each outflow has a bipolar and spherical component , with a momentum ratio of 3:1 .",
    "the model parameters are summarized in table [ tab : model ] .",
    "we first concentrate on the dense cores identified in three representative models : model n1 ( no magnetic field , @xmath55 ) , w1 ( weak magnetic field , @xmath56 ) , and s1 ( moderately - strong magnetic field , @xmath38 ) .",
    "their dimensionless outflow parameter is set to the fiducial value @xmath57 .",
    "following @xcite , we identify dense cores from the density data cube using a variant of the clumpfind algorithm of @xcite .",

    "thus , the cores identified from our simulation data correspond roughly to the dense cores observed in the dust continuum emission and high density molecular tracers such as n@xmath15h@xmath62 ( @xmath27 ) and h@xmath26co@xmath62 ( @xmath27 ) .",

    "we note that our core identification procedure is not exactly the same as those used in observational studies , which are typically based on position - position - velocity data cubes of molecular line emission or column density maps from dust continuum emission .      before discussing the physical properties of the identified cores ,",
    "we show how the magnetic field affects the global density distribution .",
    "figure [ fig : snapshot ] compares the column density distributions along the @xmath67-axis for the three models with different initial magnetic field strengths , at a stage when the star formation efficiency has reached @xmath68 .",

    ", the global density distribution shows a large - scale filamentary structure that contains many small fragments ( figs .",
    "[ fig : snapshot]a and [ fig : snapshot]d ) .",
    "the formation of the large - scale filament is probably because the turbulence energy is initially highest on the largest scale and the large - scale compression may be further amplified by self - gravity to create the filamentary structure .    for the weakly - magnetized case ( model w1 )",
    ", the global density distribution does not clearly show a large - scale filamentary structure by the stage shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : snapshot]b and [ fig : snapshot]e .",
    "the dense part appears to contain many smaller filaments or elongated fragments that are distributed almost independently of the initial magnetic field direction .",
    "this is different from the non - magnetic case .",
    "the difference may be because the local turbulent motions amplify random magnetic field components ( see section [ subsec : amplification ] ) , which slow down the formation of the large - scale filamentary structure .",
    "in contrast , in the presence of a moderately - strong magnetic field ( model s1 ) , the cloud material condenses preferentially along the magnetic field lines into a large - scale filamentary structure that is nearly perpendicular to the initial magnetic field direction .",
    "several less - dense filaments are also associated with the large - scale filament ( hereafter the main filament ) .",
    "the less - dense filaments appear to be more or less along the initial magnetic field direction and to merge toward the dense parts of the main filament .",
    "the dense cores are distributed primarily along the main filament .",
    "the column density distribution is reminiscent of the hub - filament structures of star forming regions pointed out by @xcite .",
    "the observed hub - filament structures may indicate the presence of the moderately - strong , spatially - ordered magnetic field , instead of the weak magnetic field that are tangled by supersonic turbulence .",
    "we will revisit this issue in section [ subsec : polarization ] , where we compare dust polarization maps derived from the simulation data for models w1 and s1 .      as shown in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "our model clump has reached a quasi - equilibrium state within one global free - fall time .",
    "after that , the statistical properties of the cores remain largely - unaltered . therefore , to compare the statistical properties of the identified cores , we choose the same stage as that of fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshot ] , i.e. , the stage when 16 % of the total mass has been converted into stars . in this subsection",
    ", we compare the core properties for the three representative models , models n1 , w1 , and s1 .",
    "the total numbers of identified cores are 160 , 105 , and 105 cores for models n1 , w1 , and s1 , respectively .",
    "we now focus on the physical properties of the cores identified in the three representative models . to facilitate comparison with observations , we present the core properties in dimensional units .",
    "figures [ fig : hist]a through [ fig : hist]i show the histograms of the core radius , mass , and velocity dispersion of the nonthermal component . the minimum , maximum , mean , and median values",
    "are summarized in table [ tab : physprop ] .",
    "the core radius , @xmath70 , is defined as the radius of a sphere having the same volume as the core .",
    "the distributions of core radius are broadly similar in all cases .",
    "they range from @xmath710.01  pc to @xmath720.05  pc , all peaking around 0.02  pc . the maximum and mean core radii are somewhat larger in model s1 ( the moderately - strong field case ) than in the other two .",
    "the core mass distribution shows a similar trend . in all models ,",
    "the core mass ranges from @xmath71 0.07 @xmath28 to @xmath73 .",
    "the mean value is somewhat larger for model s1 than for the other two .",
    "the mean core mass and radius are larger in model s1 probably because the stronger magnetic field can support more mass against gravitational collapse .",
    "the magnetic effect is even more prominent in the distribution of core velocity dispersion . for the non - magnetic model ( model n1 ) , the velocity dispersion ranges from @xmath71  0.1 km s@xmath23 to 4 km s@xmath23 , peaking around 1 km s@xmath23 ( corresponding to a mach number of @xmath72 4 ) .",
    "most of the cores have supersonic internal motions in this case , which appears inconsistent with the predominantly subsonic or at most transonic internal motions inferred observationally ( e.g. , andre et al . 2007 ; walsh et al . 2007 ; maruta et al .",
    "2010 , see also section [ subsec : observations ] ) . even a relatively weak magnetic field appears to affect the internal motions inside the cores significantly . for model w1",
    ", the median velocity dispersion is estimated at @xmath710.5  km  s@xmath23 , corresponding to a mach number of about 2 , although the mean is almost the same as that of model n1 .",
    "most of the cores in this case still have supersonic velocity dispersions .",
    "in contrast , for model s1 , the majority of the cores have a velocity dispersion close to , or less than , @xmath71 0.3 km s@xmath23 , which is comparable to the sound speed ( @xmath74 km s@xmath23 ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion ranges from @xmath71  0.05 km s@xmath23 to 2 km s@xmath23 , peaking around the median of 0.3 km s@xmath23 .",
    "in other words , the strong magnetic field tends to reduce the core internal motions significantly .",
    "the reduction is probably because the magnetic field cushions the converging flows in the supersonic turbulence that are largely responsible for the core formation .",
    "the magnetic effect is also evident in the virial state of the cores , as we show below .",
    "the internal motions of the observed dense cores are often measured using the velocity dispersions derived from molecular line data . here",
    ", we compare the velocity dispersions for the three representative models with different field strengths to study the effects of the magnetic field .",
    "figure [ fig : velocity - radius ] plots the non - thermal components of 3d velocity dispersions of the identified cores against the core radii for ( a ) model n1 , ( b ) model w1 , and ( c ) model s1 .",
    "the best - fit power - laws are given by @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) , @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) , and @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) for models n1 , w1 , and s1 , respectively , where @xmath81 denotes the correlation coefficient .",
    "it shows that there is no clear correlation between the velocity dispersion and core radius .",
    "our cores do not follow the power - law linewidth - radius relation derived by @xcite .",
    "the same conclusion holds for dense cores formed in even more strongly magnetized , magnetically subcritical , clouds ( see figure 18 of * ? ? ?",
    "the reason is probably that the dense cores created out of turbulent molecular gas are generally not in virial equilibrium ( the equilibrium is implied by larson s laws ) and that their formation is strongly influenced by external turbulent flows ( see below ) .",
    "quantitatively , the velocity dispersions of the cores depend on the initial magnetic field strength , as shown already in figs .",
    "[ fig : hist]g through [ fig : hist]i . in the absence of magnetic field ( model n1 ) , about 40% of the cores have velocity dispersions larger than 1 km s@xmath23 ; the majority of the cores have supersonic internal motions .",
    "as mentioned above , even a relatively weak magnetic field can influence the internal motions significantly . in model w1 , although many cores still have large velocity dispersions , the median value is less than that in model n1 by a factor of @xmath82 . in the stronger field case ( model s1 ) , the median and mean of the velocity dispersions are estimated at 0.31 and 0.46 km s@xmath23 .",
    "about 40 % of the cores have velocity dispersions smaller than the sound speed of 0.266 km s@xmath23 ; the majority of the cores have subsonic or at most transonic internal motions , which is more consistent with observations .",
    "we conclude that the magnetic field plays a significant role in reducing the internal motions of the cores .",
    "the virial parameter , the ratio of the virial mass to core mass , is often used as a measure of the gravitational boundedness of dense molecular cloud cores , particularly in observational studies . in fig .",
    "[ fig : virial parameter ] , we plot the virial parameters against the core mass for the three models . here , we calculate the virial parameter as @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the 1d fwhm velocity width including thermal contribution and the virial mass of each core is obtained by assuming that it is a uniform sphere .",
    "the virial mass depends on the density distribution . for a centrally condense sphere with @xmath85 , the virial parameter",
    "is reduced by a factor of @xmath86 .",
    "note that the effects of the nonspherical mass distribution appear to be small as long as the aspect ratios of the cores are not far from unity @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : virial parameter ] indicates that the relationship between the virial parameter and core mass depends on the initial magnetic field strength . in the absence of a magnetic field ( model n1 ) , the virial parameters are typically very large , and have a large scatter .",
    "the scatter in the virial parameter - mass plot comes mainly from the large scatter in the velocity dispersion - radius relation ( see fig . [",
    "fig : velocity - radius ] ) .",
    "the virial parameters often exceed @xmath87 even for relatively massive cores , indicating that , for most of the cores , the gravitational energy is much smaller than the internal kinetic energy .",
    "the virial parameters tend to increase with decreasing core mass , and the lower bound of the virial parameters follows roughly a power - law relation of @xmath88 .    for the model with a weak magnetic field ( model w1 ) , the virial parameter - mass relation is qualitatively similar to that of the non - magnetized model ( model n1 ) .",
    "although the fraction of cores with large virial parameters is somewhat small for the weak magnetic field case , the scatter in the viral parameter - mass relation remains large .",
    "about 30 % of the cores still have virial parameters larger than 10 .    on the other hand , for the model with a moderately - strong magnetic field ( model s1 ) , the identified cores tend to follow a single power - law relation of @xmath88 , with a rather small scatter . furthermore , most of the cores ( about 9 % of the cores ) have virial parameters smaller than 10 . this trend is consistent with the initially - magnetically subcritical case ( see figure 17 of * ? ? ?",
    "it is also in good agreement with the scaling found by @xcite for nearby giant molecular clouds .",
    "according to @xcite , an object confined by the ambient pressure has a virial ratio that is proportional to @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the jeans mass defined by equation ( 2.13 ) of @xcite .",
    "the fact that our cores follow the same relation implies that the ambient pressure plays an important role in confining our cores as well . in the next subsection",

    "in particular , the gravitational term can be positive in crowded environments where the background gravitational field dominates the core dynamics ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in fact , as shown below , several cores have positive gravitational terms in our simulations , although no cores have positive gravitational terms for the initially magnetically subcritical case where the turbulent motions are not so strong because of the effects of magnetic cushion ( see fig .",

    "the second term on the left - hand side of equation ( [ eq : virial ] ) denotes the time derivative of the flux of moment of inertia through the core boundary .",
    "as is the standard practice @xcite , we ignore the left - hand side of equation ( [ eq : virial ] ) in our discussion and consider a core to be in virial equilibrium if the sum @xmath107 .",

    "for the surface term , the external kinetic term is generally much larger than the magnetic term ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "for all three models , the majority of the cores lie below the virial equilibrium line , and thus they are expected to be unstable to contraction .",

    "about 10 @xmath110 20 % of the cores have the normalized surface term of @xmath111 , whereas no cores have the normalized surface term of @xmath112 in the presence of the moderately - strong magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field tends to reduce the contribution of the surface terms to the core dynamical state , although the surface term is still dominant even in the presence of the strong magnetic field .",
    "the core virial state is in contrast to the initially - magnetically subcritical case . for the initially - magnetically subcritical case , for most of the cores , the surface term ( @xmath108 ) and gravitational term ( @xmath102 ) tend to be smaller than the sum of the internal terms , @xmath109 @xcite , and thus most of the cores are distributed around the virial equilibrium line .",
    "in addition , more massive cores tend to be distributed below the virial equilibrium line , and the importance of the self - gravity tends to depend on the core mass .",
    "the gravitational term tends to be more important for more massive cores for the initially magnetically subcritical case , implying that the gravitational collapse induced by ambipolar diffusion regulates the core evolution .",
    "in contrast , for the magnetically - supercritical cases studied in this paper , most of the cores are distributed further from the virial equilibrium line . the surface term ( @xmath108 )",
    "tends to be larger than the sum of the internal terms , @xmath109 for most of the cores .",
    "the core virial state shows no clear dependence on the mass .",
    "the surface term , which is typically dominated by the ambient supersonic turbulence , is still important even for massive cores .",
    "the above result is different from that of @xcite .",
    "they found , in their ideal mhd simulations , a larger contribution from the surface term to the virial equation for a stronger magnetic field , which is oppose to the trend we found .",
    "this difference likely comes from the fact that they only followed the very early phase of cloud evolution , when the initial supersonic turbulence has decayed significantly but star formation has yet to set in .",
    "most of our cores are formed at much later times , after the decayed turbulence has been replenished by outflow feedback .",
    "given this difference , it is perhaps not too surprising that the surface terms are much larger in our models than in theirs .",
    "this is particularly true for the weaker magnetic field case , because of a more rapid and violent star formation .    in our simulations ,",
    "most of the identified cores have the densities smaller than the critical density beyond which the jeans condition is violated .",
    "for example , the jeans condition is satisfied for 89 % ( model n1 ) , 85 % ( model w1 ) , and 95 % ( model s1 ) of the cores presented in this subsection . for the stronger initial magnetic field ,",
    "the mean density of the cores tend to be smaller due to the magnetic support , and therefore the jeans condition is satisfied for a larger number of cores .",
    "we also performed a run with 512@xmath113 for model s1 , with the threshold density fixed , so that the jeans condition is always satisfied in the entire computation box . to compare directly with the results presented in this subsection , we first resized the data obtained from the @xmath114 run to the @xmath48 grid data , and then applied the clumpfind method to the regridded data .",

    ", we now turn to the outflow strength . in our model ,",
    "the strength of the outflow feedback is specified by the dimensionless parameter , @xmath52 .",

    ". this difference may be due to the fact that the ambient turbulent motions are weaker without any outflow feedback and thus the turbulent fragmentation does not form smaller - scale structures as efficiently .",
    "figure [ fig : outflow ] indicates that the velocity dispersion - radius relation does not depend strongly on the strength of the outflow feedback . for all three models , there is no clear relationship between the velocity dispersion and the core radius .",
    "thus , it appears difficult to discriminate the effects of protostellar outflows based on the velocity dispersion - radius relation alone .    the surface term - gravitational term plots in figs .",

    ", more cores are located near the dashed line ( where the two terms are equal ) .",
    "the gravitational term appears more important for this model than for the other two , although the surface term is clearly still important .",
    "this is due , at least in part , to the fact that the global gravitational infall can generate fast motions even in the absence of protostellar outflow driven turbulence .",
    "it is difficult , however , to gauge the effects of the outflow feedback from the virial parameters of the cores , which are often used in observational studies of the molecular cloud cores in star - forming molecular clouds .",
    "the difficulty is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : outflow3]a through [ fig : outflow3]c , where we show the virial parameter - mass relations for the three models with different outflow strengths . in all cases ,",

    ", we investigate how well the outflow axes are aligned with the global or initial magnetic field direction in parsec - scale cluster forming clumps . in our simulations ,",
    "the outflow direction is set to the local magnetic field direction at the position of each formed star .",
    "this should be a reasonable approximation since the outflows are most likely driven along the local magnetic field by field line twisting due to disk rotation , ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the outflow direction shows a broad distribution , taking its maximum at the mean angle of about 30@xmath120 .",
    "the conclusion is that , although there is some preference for the outflows to align with the global magnetic field direction , the alignment is not as strong as one may naively expect .",
    "this is because most of the dense cores are formed through outflow - induced turbulent compression , which can push the magnetic field on the core scale away from the global field direction . on smaller scales ,",
    "the misalignment in field direction can be further amplified by gravitational collapse .",
    "the lack of a complete alignment between the outflow axes and the global field direction is thus expected .",
    "it can not be used to argue against the presence of a moderately - strong global magnetic field .",
    "here , we compare the core properties obtained in section [ sec : results ] with observations .",
    "we use the core data toward two nearby parsec - scale cluster - forming clumps : the @xmath25 ophiuchus main cloud and ngc 1333 in perseus . in the @xmath25 ophiuchus region",

    "since both the h@xmath26co@xmath62 ( @xmath27 ) and n@xmath15h@xmath62 ( @xmath27 ) transitions have critical densities of order @xmath59 @xmath13 , the h@xmath26co@xmath62 and n@xmath15h@xmath62 cores should have densities comparable to our simulated cores , which were identified using a threshold density @xmath59 @xmath13 .",
    "since the moderately - strong field model yields a core velocity dispersion that is in better general agreement with observations than the non - magnetic or weak - field model , we will concentrate on comparing its cores with the @xmath25 oph and ngc  1333 data .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : obs]a , we compare the 1d fwhm nonthermal velocity width - radius relations for the @xmath25 oph cores of @xcite and our simulated cores ( see section [ sec : results ] ) .",

    "neither shows a clear dependence of linewidth with size , except for a weak trend for the linewidth to increase slightly with radius .",
    "neither follows the larson s linewidth - size relation .",
    "the observations are also consistent with the cores formed from initially - magnetically subcritical clouds ( see fig",
    ". 18 of * ? ? ?",
    "we did not plot the ngc 1333 cores on fig .",
    "[ fig : obs]a because the core radius in table 1 of @xcite was quoted in single significant digit , which artificially introduces a large scatter in the plot .",
    "nevertheless , inspection by eye reveals no clear correlation between the velocity width and core radius , broadly consistent with the data for both the @xmath25 oph cores and the simulated cores of model s1 .",
    "figure [ fig : obs]b compares the virial parameter - mass relations of the simulated and observed cores .",
    "the red and blue dots , and black crosses denotes the @xmath25 oph @xcite and ngc 1333 cores @xcite , and the cores of model s1 , respectively . for the ngc 1333 cores , we recalculated the virial masses by including the thermal contribution from the gas with a temperature of 15 k and adopting a distance of 235 pc @xcite , instead of 300 pc used in @xcite .",
    "we also recalculated the lte masses by adopting the n@xmath15h@xmath62 fractional abundance relative to h@xmath15 of @xmath122 derived from observations toward @xmath25 oph because @xcite determined their adopted n@xmath15h@xmath62 fractional abundance such that the points are distributed evenly about the line of equality ( @xmath123 ) in their @xmath124-@xmath125 plot .",
    "this n@xmath15h@xmath62 fractional abundance is determined by taking average of the values obtained toward oph a @xcite and b2 subclumps @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : obs]b indicates that the virial parameter - core mass relation of the nearby cluster - forming clumps follows roughly a single power - law of @xmath126 with a small dispersion , which is again in good agreement with model s1 that has a moderately - strong magnetic field .",
    "a dynamically important magnetic field may have played a role in core formation in these regions .    besides the @xmath25 oph region",
    ", @xcite found that the velocity dispersions of h@xmath26co@xmath62 cores are almost independent of the core radius in orion a as well , even though the latter is more than a factor of 3 farther away .",
    "the coarser spatial resolution for orion means that its cores may contain ( smaller , @xmath25 oph - like ) cores blending together .",
    "if this is true , then the nearly flat velocity - width - radius relation observed in both regions suggests that the inter - core motions among the neighboring cores are almost comparable to the internal motions in the individual cores .",
    "such a feature was pointed out by @xcite who measured the velocity difference among neighboring cores using n@xmath15h@xmath62 ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "if the velocity - width - radius relation is flat ( @xmath127 constant ) and the core mass is proportional to @xmath128 , then the virial parameter is scaled as @xmath129 , a similar power - law to that derived by @xcite .",
    "this again suggests the importance of ambient turbulent pressure in dynamics of the cores as discussed in section [ sec : results ] .      to isolate the effect of magnetic field on clustered star formation , we present in fig . [ fig : sfe]a the time evolution of star formation efficiency ( sfe ) for three models with different field strengths but no outflow feedback .",
    "our simulations show that , as expected , the magnetic field tends to slow down star formation , especially at relatively late times .",
    "the rate of star formation remains rather high , however , particularly at early times .",
    "for example , from the formation of the first star to the time when the sfe reaches @xmath130 , the average star formation efficiency per global free - fall time ( sfr@xmath131 ; krumholz & mckee 2005 ) is estimated to be 29 % , 27 % , and 21 % , respectively , for models n2 , w2 , and s2 .",
    "these values are larger than the observationally inferred values of a few % @xcite .",
    "the large sfr@xmath131 in the absence of outflow feedback is in agreement with previous studies ( see also the appendix for the analytic formula of sfr@xmath131 ) .",
    "for example , using mhd sph simulations , @xcite and @xcite followed the evolution of 50 @xmath28 clumps with @xmath132 until @xmath133 .",
    "although their initial model clump mass is too small compared to nearby cluster - forming clumps like @xmath25 oph and ngc 1333 ( which have masses of order @xmath134 m@xmath2 ) , their star formation efficiencies per free - fall time are estimated to be over 10 % .",
    "these simulations imply that it is difficult to reduce the star formation rate to the observed level by a moderately - strong magnetic field alone , and other factors are needed to significantly retard star formation in cluster - forming clumps .",
    "one way to slow down star formation is the feedback from forming stars .",
    "@xcite found that radiative feedback from forming stars does not change the global star formation efficiency in a parent clump much , although it significantly suppresses the small - scale fragmentation by increasing the temperature in the high - density material near the protostars .",
    "figure [ fig : sfe]b shows that the star formation rate is greatly reduced by the inclusion of outflow feedback , even in the presence of a relatively weak magnetic field , in agreement with previous studies @xcite . the average star formation efficiency per global free - fall time is estimated to be 8 % , 6 % , and 4 % for model n1 ( no magnetic field ) , w1 ( weak field ) , and s1 ( moderately - strong field ) , respectively . for the model with the moderately - strong field , the sfr@xmath131 is more or less comparable to the observed value .",
    "the reason for the large reduction in sfr@xmath131 can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : magnetic field ] , where the magnetic energy is plotted against the evolution time , for models w1 and s1 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : magnetic field]a , for the moderately - strong field case , the total magnetic energy is dominated by the background uniform field that does not contribute to the force balance in the initial cloud .",

    "[ fig : magnetic field]b the evolution of the total kinetic energy of the clump . since the kinetic energy is often dominated by the unbound high - velocity gas associated with the active outflows , we approximate the total kinetic energy of the clump as the kinetic energy of the gas whose velocity is smaller than 10 @xmath135 . for both models ,",
    "the amplified components tend to increase with time . for the model with the moderately - strong field ,",
    "the amplified component begins to oscillate around a level value after a free - fall time .",
    "for both models , the magnetic energy of the amplified component becomes comparable to the kinetic energy of the dense gas by the end of the computation , indicating that a quasi - equipartition has been reached ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "for the weak field case , the amplified component is more important than the initial uniform field , resulting in a significantly - distorted magnetic field structure .",

    "we computed the polarized thermal dust emission from the mhd model following @xcite .",

    "[ fig : polarization ] . as expected from fig .",
    "[ fig:3d ] , in the presence of a weak magnetic field , the spatial distribution of the polarization vectors has relatively large fluctuations .",
    "the polarization degree tends to be smaller in several parts where the magnetic fields are strongly distorted . in the densest parts , the polarization vectors appear more or less parallel to the local elongated structures or dense filaments , whereas there is no clear correlation between the vectors and density distribution in less dense parts .",
    "this may be due to the fact that the local dense filaments are created by turbulent compression that preferentially enhances the magnetic field component transverse to the shock plane .",
    "in contrast , in the presence of the strong magnetic field , the filamentary structure is prominent and the filament axes tend to be perpendicular to the polarization vectors that are almost parallel to the initial magnetic field direction , suggesting that the gas flow is channeled preferentially by the strong magnetic field to form the filaments .",
    "the polarization observations can thus provide a handle on the magnetic field strength of cluster - forming clumps .",

    "@xcite found that the serpens south filamentary infrared dark cloud appears to be threaded by more or less straight global magnetic field .",

    "in addition , we added up the cores identified from the runs using the different initial turbulent realization for which the different random numbers were used for both the amplitude and phase .",

    "the overall shapes of the cmfs are similar in all three cases , suggesting the shape of the cmf is relatively insensitive to the initial magnetic field strength .",

    "in our simulations , a moderately - strong magnetic field can produce a cmf that resembles the salpeter imf as well .",
    "we note two interesting features of the computed cmfs .",
    "first , there appear to be a lack of massive cores compared to the salpeter stellar imf .",
    "this is not necessarily a problem , because it is unclear whether the nearby cluster - forming clumps such as @xmath25 oph and ngc 1333 that we aim to simulate would ever produce massive stars . alternatively",
    ", massive stars can grow from initially less massive cores , fed by global collapsing flows towards the bottom of the clump potential ( smith et al .",
    "2008 ; wang et al .",
    "second , the turnover at the low mass end is less clear in the cmfs than in the kroupa or chabrier imf .",
    "this may be because , at the low mass end , most of the cores are gravitationally unbound , and may not form stars .",
    "further studies are required to determine the relation between the cmf and imf .",
    "we have performed a set of 3d mhd simulations of cluster formation taking into account the effects of protostellar outflow feedback , and identified dense cores by applying a clumpfind algorithm to the simulated 3d density data cubes .",
    "the main results are as follows .",
    "dense cores do not follow larson s linewidth - size relation .",
    "we find that the velocity dispersions of dense cores show little correlation with core radius , irrespective of the strength of the magnetic field and outflow feedback . in the absence of a magnetic field ,",
    "the majority of the cores have supersonic velocity dispersions , whereas in the presence of a moderately - strong magnetic field , the cores tend to be subsonic or at most transonic .",
    "we find that most of the cores are out of virial equilibrium , with the external pressure due to ambient turbulence dominating the self - gravity .",
    "the core formation and evolution is largely controlled by the dynamical compression due to outflow - driven turbulence . such a situation is contrast to the strongly - magnetized ( magnetically subcritical ) case , where the self - gravity plays a more important role in the core dynamics , particularly for massive cores .",
    "even an initially - weak magnetic field can retard star formation significantly , because the field is amplified by supersonic turbulence to an equipartition strength .",
    "in such an initially weak field , the distorted field component dominates the uniform one .",

    "such a difference in the magnetic structure can be observed in simulated polarization maps of dust thermal emission .",

    "numerical simulations of protostellar turbulence indicate that the dissipation rate of the turbulence momentum , @xmath137 , balances the momentum injection rate by the protostellar outflow feedback , @xmath138 , so that the clump can be kept close to a virial equilibrium , @xmath139    the dissipation rate of the turbulence momentum , @xmath137 , can be written as @xmath140 where @xmath141 @xcite . the virial velocity , @xmath142 , is given by @xmath143 the momentum dissipation time is @xmath144 .",
