    "thermodynamics of yukawa systems ( particles interacting via the pairwise yukawa repulsive potential ) is of considerable interest , in particular in the context of conventional plasmas , dusty ( complex ) plasmas , and colloidal suspensions . for small point - like particles",
    "the yukawa potential ( also known as screened coulomb or debye - hckel potential ) reads @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the energy scale , @xmath2 is the screening length , and @xmath3 is the distance between a pair of particles . for charged particles immersed in a neutralizing medium we have @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the particle charge , and",
    "the screening length @xmath2 is equal to the corresponding debye radius .",
    "such system are fully characterized by two dimensionless parameters .",
    "the first is the coupling parameter , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the characteristic interparticle separation [ in this paper we take @xmath8 in three dimensions and @xmath9 in two dimensions , where @xmath10 is the particle density ] and @xmath11 is the temperature ( in energy units ) . the second is the screening parameter , defined as @xmath12 .",
    "statical and dynamical properties of yukawa systems in both two- and three - dimensional configurations have been extensively investigated using various theoretical and simulation techniques .",
    "thermodynamic properties have also received considerable attention .",
    "the accurate results from monte carlo ( mc ) and molecular dynamics ( md ) numerical simulations for some thermodynamic functions ( in particular , for internal energy and compressibility ) have been tabulated for a wide ( but discrete ) range of state variables @xmath13 and @xmath14  @xcite . recently ,",
    "simple and accurate expressions to evaluate thermodynamic properties of three - dimensional ( 3d ) yukawa fluids  @xcite and solids  @xcite have been proposed , which are very convenient for practical applications .",
    "these expressions are based on the rosenfeld - tarazona ( rt ) scaling  @xcite of the excess internal energy in the fluid state ( and harmonic approximation in the solid state ) and deliver impressively high accuracy in a wide range of the phase diagram of 3d yukawa systems .",
    "the focus of the present study is on the practical estimation of the thermodynamics of yukawa fluids near the one - component - plasma ( ocp ) limit .",
    "the ocp corresponds to the limit @xmath15 for yukawa systems .",
    "we show that for @xmath16 the ocp scaling of the thermal component of the excess internal energy of 3d yukawa fluids is superior to that of the rt scaling .",
    "this allows us to somewhat improve the accuracy of our previous practical approach to the thermodynamics of 3d yukawa fluids  @xcite in the case of weak screening .",
    "more importantly , we show that the thermal component of the excess internal energy exhibits a quasi - universal scaling also in two - dimensional systems of soft repulsive particles ( which is , however , quite different compared to the rt or ocp scaling in 3d case ) . based on the 2d ocp limit",
    "we then produce a simple analytical expression for the excess energy of weakly screened 2d yukawa systems .",
    "the accuracy of this expression is verified by comparison with the results from md simulations .",
    "we demonstrate how this expression can be used to evaluate the specific heat , free energy , compressibility factor , and isothermal compressibility modulus of 2d yukawa fluids in practical situations .",
    "the reduced excess energy ( excess energy per particle in units of the system temperature ) can be conveniently divided into static and thermal components , @xmath17 the static contribution corresponds to the value of internal energy when the particles are frozen in some regular structure ( e.g. crystalline lattice ) and the thermal corrections arise due the deviations from these fixed position due to the particle thermal motion . in the strongly coupled classical ocp , the simplest estimate of the static component can be obtained using the ion sphere model ( ism )  @xcite . in this model each particle is restricted to the spherical cell of radius @xmath7 , filled with the neutralizing background .",
    "each cell is quasineutral , the cells do not overlap , and , therefore , @xmath18 is simply equal to the electrostatic energy of such cell .",
    "the latter can be readily calculated , yielding @xmath19  @xcite ( the energy is negative due to particle - background interactions ) .",
    "in fact , this can be mathematically proven to be the exact lower bound on the excess energy of the ocp  @xcite .",
    "the ism approach provides a rather good estimate of the actual ocp excess energy at strong coupling , in both fluid and solid phases ( for example , the madelung constant of the ocp forming a body - centered - cubic lattice is @xmath20 ) .",
    "another exact lower bound on the ocp excess energy is provided by the debye - hckel ( dh ) construction  @xcite .",
    "this bound is a reasonable measure of the actual energy at weak coupling .",
    "recently a physically motivated interpolation between the dh and ism limits has been discussed in ref .",

    "@xcite for the details ) .",
    "note that , in contrast to the ocp limit where the neutralizing background must be present to keep thermodynamic functions finite and well defined , for model yukawa systems two realizations are possible .",
    "the first corresponds to the conventional system of charged particles immersed into neutralizing medium , which provides exponential screening of the particle - particle electrical interactions and keeps the overall charge neutrality ( this situation can to some extent mimic real colloidal suspensions and complex plasmas  @xcite ) .",
    "the second is the imaginary one - component system of particles interacting via the yukawa potential without any neutralizing medium , which we will refer to as the single component yukawa system ( scys ) , and which is merely used as a useful model in condensed matter research .",
    "the difference between the excess energies of these two systems is related to the interactions between the particles and the neutralizing medium .",
    "the difference can be evaluated as  @xcite @xmath23 where the first term represents the energy of the medium that , on average , neutralizes the charge of the particles ( it exactly compensates the energy of the particle - particle interactions when the particles are at complete disorder ) .",

    "the accuracy of this scaling for various model systems has been recently investigated in extensive numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "it has been observed that the rt scaling is particulary useful for liquids with strong correlations between equilibrium fluctuations of virial and potential energy  @xcite , which are referred to as rosklide - simple or just rosklide systems  @xcite .",
    "ocp and strongly coupled yukawa systems belong to this class and , thus , rt scaling can be quite useful to describe thermodynamic properties of these systems .",
    "previously , a variant of the rt scaling has been successfully used to obtain practical expressions for the internal energy and pressure of 3d yukawa fluids with @xmath30 across coupling regimes  @xcite .",
    "the expression for the thermal component of the excess energy suggested in this work is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the coupling parameter at the fluid - solid phase transition .",
    "more recently , it has been also pointed out that for yukawa fluids sufficiently close to freezing an even simpler scaling , @xmath33 , is more appropriate  @xcite .",
    "the first question to be addressed now is which of the scalings , ocp [ eq .  ( [ 3dfit ] ) ] or rt [ eq .",

    "we see that the ocp scaling is a better approximation for @xmath44 .",
    "the deviations between these two scalings are particularly observable for intermediate coupling @xmath45 , as indicated in fig .",
    "the observation that the ocp scaling provides better description for the thermal component of the excess energy of weakly screened ( @xmath16 ) yukawa systems allows us to improve the previous practical approach to the thermodynamics of yukawa fluids in this regime .",

    "( [ rt ] ) . , width=283 ]    it is clear that the thermodynamic functions depending on the total excess energy ( like e.g. pressure and compressibility modulus ) , will be only slightly affected by the differences between the ocp and rt scalings of the thermal energy , since the static energy component dominates for soft repulsive potentials .",
    "however , other thermodynamic functions can be more sensitive to these differences . for example",
    ", the reduced specific heat at constant volume is determined by the reduced thermal energy alone , @xmath46 in figure  [ fig3 ] we plot the available numerical data for @xmath47 for the ocp , along with the analytical expressions based on the ocp and rt scalings .",
    "the scattering of the numerical data points does not allow us to clearly discriminate between the ocp and rt scalings . nevertheless , based on the comparison shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , it is not unreasonable to expect that the ocp scaling is more appropriate for very soft repulsive potentials , which implies , for instance , @xmath48 , instead of @xmath49 ( according to the rt scaling ) in this regime .",
    "as in the previous section , we first consider the ocp limit . in two - dimensions , two different systems",
    "are actually referred to as the ocp .",
    "the first is characterized by logarithmic interactions , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is an arbitrary length scale  @xcite .",
    "the logarithmic potential emerges from the solution of the two - dimensional poisson equation around the central point - like particle  @xcite . in this case",
    "the system is conventionally characterized by the coupling parameter @xmath52 , which does not depend on the particle density . in the second system , the interaction is of conventional coulomb - type , @xmath53 , but the interacting particles are confined to the 2d plane . in this second case ,",
    "the coupling parameter is defined similarly to the ocp ( or yukawa ) system in 3d , @xmath6 , with @xmath7 being the 2d analog of the wigner - seitz radius ( defined in the introduction ) .",
    "the numerical results for the internal energy of both ocp systems are available in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the first interesting point to address , is wether the scaling of the thermal component of the excess energy in two - dimensions is also quasi - universal for soft repulsive systems ( like the two ocps considered here ) , similarly to the 3d case . for the static component of the energy in the 2d case we use the triangular lattice sums ( madelung energies ) , which are @xmath54 for the logarithmic and @xmath55 for the coulomb potential , respectively  @xcite .",
    "( the ion disc model , an analog of the ism in 3d , can be constructed for logarithmic interactions  @xcite , but we are not aware of any such construction for the coulomb interaction in 2d ) . then , subtracting the static component from the full excess energy ( when necessary ) we can obtain the thermal energy component . the resulting dependence of @xmath56 on the reduced coupling parameter @xmath37 is shown in figure  [ fig4 ] . to produce this figure we assumed @xmath57 for the logarithmic interaction  @xcite and @xmath58 for the coulomb interaction  @xcite .",
    "the closeness of @xmath32 values for these two systems is likely a coincidence , since the physical meaning of the coupling parameters is quite different for the logarithmic and coulomb interactions .    .",

    "we see that the universal scaling only holds for sufficiently soft interactions , which is not the case for the ipl @xmath60 case ( the thermal energy is systematically lower ) .",

    "[ fig4 ] ( the fit yields @xmath67 and @xmath68 for the @xmath60 ipl ) .",
    "now , by analogy with approach discussed in the previous section , we apply the observed soft - repulsion scaling of @xmath56 to evaluate the excess energy of weakly screened yukawa systems in 2d geometry .",
    "the static component of the excess energy is associated with the triangular lattice sum ( madelung energy ) , which for the yukawa interaction can be approximated by  @xcite @xmath69 note that this static energy accounts for particle - particle correlations and the energy of the neutralizing medium ( this is why the energy is negative ) .",
    "the energy of the neutralizing medium ( plasma ) compensates the energy coming from particle - particle interactions when no correlations are present .",
