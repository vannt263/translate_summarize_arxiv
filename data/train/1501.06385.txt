    "one of the novel developments of ultracold matter research is exemplified by the experiments aiming at merging a cold atom trap and a trap of laser - cooled ions .",
    "such hybrid setups could offer the opportunity to study collisional dynamics in the quantum @xmath1-wave scattering regime associated to the long - range interaction between the ion and the atom varying as @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the ion - atom distance ) @xcite , just like it has been extensively studied for ultracold neutral atom - atom collisions ( see for instance ref .",
    "these hybrid devices have also been proposed to emulate solid - state physics where a band structure in the fermionic atoms -thus simulating electrons- could be induced by periodic structure generated by the laser - cooled ions @xcite .",
    "other prospects concern the implementation of a josephson junction through a pair of cold atoms controlled by a single ion @xcite , the immersion of a single ion into a tonk - girardeau gas to generate an ionic density `` bubble '' @xcite , or the elaboration of an atom - ion quantum gate @xcite .",
    "the variety of combinations of laser - cooled alkali - metal atoms and alkaline - earth ( or rare earth ) atomic ions allows to explore the limit of sympathetic cooling between them depending on their mass ratio @xcite .",
    "also , a wealth of cold molecular ions species could be created , opening the way to a rich chemistry at temperatures of a few millikelvin , or less @xcite . following the theoretical prospect of ref .",
    "@xcite with cold na trapped in a magnetooptical trap ( mot ) and laser - cooled ca@xmath0 ions in a paul trap ( then followed by further developments @xcite ) , other groups have carried out pioneering experiments with various combinations of atoms and atomic ions : yb atoms with yb@xmath0 ions @xcite , rb atoms with ca@xmath0 @xcite and ba@xmath0 @xcite ions , and ca atoms with yb@xmath0 ions @xcite or ba@xmath0 ions @xcite .",
    "rubidium atoms can also be confined in a magnetic trap in ( or close to ) the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) regime thus ensuring with a density larger than in a mot , and then interacting with a few yb@xmath0 ions @xcite .",
    "similarly , an optical dipole trap of rb atoms has been merged in a paul trap containing a few ba@xmath0 atoms @xcite ( or with the combination li / ca@xmath0 @xcite ) . when atomic ions like rb@xmath0 or na@xmath0 can not be laser - cooled , they can be sympathetically cooled by another species in the paul trap in the presence of trapped rb atoms @xcite or na atoms @xcite , or they can be created _ in situ _ inside the paul trap by photoionization of trapped rb atoms @xcite . to be complete ,",
    "sympathetically - cooled molecular ions created from an external source have been utilized in two remarkable experiments : one has demonstrated the vibrational quenching of bacl@xmath0 ions by laser - cooled ca atoms @xcite , and another one has recorded a particularly large charge - exchange rate between n@xmath4 ions and laser - cooled rb atoms @xcite . a comprehensive review of most of these experiments can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "elastic and inelastic collisions as well as elementary reactions like charge transfer between the trapped ions and the trapped atoms have been studied in these experiments .",
    "due to the residual micromotion of the trapped ions , these studies have been limited to energies larger than a few millikelvin , well beyond the @xmath1-wave quantum regime .",
    "it has been recognized in several of these experiments ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the cooling and/or trapping light most often assist the reaction through the excitation of one of the colliding partners , inducing large rates described by the langevin regime close to the unitarity limit .    among all these experiments ,",
    "it is striking that so far , the direct observation of molecular ions resulting from the association of a cold atom and a cold ion has been reported only in two cases , namely rbca@xmath0 @xcite and rbba@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "these observations have been assigned to the formation of ions by radiative association ( ra ) , _ i.e. _ rb + ( alke)@xmath5 rb(alke)@xmath6 ( where ( alke ) = ca , ba ) , and @xmath7 is the energy of the photon emitted during the collision in order to stabilize the molecular ion @xcite .",
    "the ra process competes with radiative charge transfer ( rct ) rb + ( alke)@xmath5 rb@xmath8 ( alke ) @xmath9 when ( alke ) = ba , and is dominated by non - radiative charge transfer ( nrct ) in the rb / ca@xmath0 case @xcite .",
    "the ra of cayb@xmath0 has been invoked  but molecular ions have not been directly detected  in ref .",
    "@xcite to explain the measured fast reaction rate , but not confirmed by a subsequent theoretical investigation @xcite .    in order to clarify the possible molecular ion formation processes and their efficiency in such merged ion and atom traps ,",
    "we achieved in this paper a systematic and consistent analysis of the inelastic collisions of cold rb/(alke)@xmath0 pairs in their ground state considering the two competitive channels of ra and rct . here the notation ( alke ) refers to the alkaline - earth atoms ca , sr , ba . for convenience the lanthanide atom yb , with its closed @xmath10 shell and its external @xmath11 shell , will be included in this ( alke ) notation .",
    "the li - yb@xmath0 complex is also studied as its significantly different mass ratio motivated the analogy for using this combination to emulate solid - state physics @xcite .",
    "occasionnally , the rb and li alkali - metal atoms will be referred to as the ( alk ) species . after recalling the basics of the derivation of expressions for the cross section and the rates ( section [ sec : theory ] ) ,",
    "we describe the electronic structure ( potential energy curves , transition and permanent electric dipole moments ) of the relevant molecular ions ( alk - alke)@xmath0 using accurate quantum chemistry calculations based on the representation of the colliding partners with effective core potentials ( ecp ) including core polarization potentials ( section [ sec : structure ] ) which are compared to other determinations when available .",
    "we present our results for both ra and rct cross sections and rates , emphasizing then on the presence of narrow shape resonances induced by the centrifugal barrier in the entrance channel , and on the vibrational distribution of the molecular ions , which are not expected to be created in their ground level ( section [ sec : rates ] ) .",

    ", the summation on @xmath49 is actually limited for each collisional energy to the maximal value for which the induced rotational barrier in the entrance channel prevents the collision to occur .",

    "our calculations cover an energy range in the entrance channel from 1  mk up to 80  mk , currently accessible in most experiments .",
    "this requires to consider @xmath49 values in the range [ 15;40 ] , [ 20;50 ] , [ 20;50 ] , [ 20;55 ] , [ 5;15 ] for rbca@xmath0 , rbsr@xmath0 , rbca@xmath0 , rbyb@xmath0 , and liyb@xmath0 respectively , in order to obtain converged cross sections .",

    "the first case depicts a regime similar to the langevin one , with the same @xmath67 energy dependence of the cross - section at high energy in every partial wave , but with a magnitude smaller than the one predicted by the langevin model ( see section  [ sec : rates ] ) .",
    "note also the alternation of the occurrence of the shape resonances : if a shape resonance shows up for the partial wave @xmath68 , another also occurs for the @xmath69 partial wave as demonstrated by b.  gao in the case of a @xmath2 long range interaction @xcite .",
    "the potential energy curves , permanent electric dipole moments ( pedms ) and transition electric dipole moments are computed following the same method described in details in ref .  @xcite .",
