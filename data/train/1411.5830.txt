    "the parameter combinations corresponding to the distorted unit cells shown in [ fig_scenario_00 ] are highlighted in the diagram and are close to the crossover to a finite escape probability .",
    "we compare the pattern of defect formation observed in the sheared binary crystal to the creation of defects when the crystal is heated to @xmath77 and no shear flow is imposed ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "our results are included in fig .",
    "[ fig_scenario_00 ] and indicate a qualitatively different mechanism with respect to the individual particle motion . here , the crystalline structure can not be attributed to an aligned deflection of the @xmath0-particles but rather stems from a diffusion of the particles away from the unit cell center .",
    "+   + furthermore , we qualitatively compare the deformation process of the sheared binary crystal to the shear deformation of a one - component crystal near melting .",
    "the crystal is constituted by @xmath42 dipolar particles of species @xmath0 which are arranged in a triangular lattice spanning the simulation area @xmath95 .",
    "the inverse temperature is set to @xmath96 and the shear rate is fixed at @xmath97 as before . for the one - component crystal , the structural rearrangment needed to release the strain",

    "white circles indicate clusters with a lifetime above @xmath98 , straight cyan lines connect sites of creation and annihilation .",
    "short - lived clusters with a lifetime below @xmath98 are indicated by red dots . ]",
    "as opposed to the binary crystal , these topological defects can be spontaneously created to accomodate rearrangements of the adjacent particles .",
    "thus , the onset of plasticity is not determined by the presence of persistent topological defects , as is the case with the binary crystal .",
    "similarly , the defects are quickly annihilated once the crystal rearranged into a less strained configuration .",
    "thus , the defects observed in the sheared one - component crystal are mostly short - lived with a lifetime well below @xmath98 and the deformation of the crystal does not entail an extended amorphous region .",
    "we observe that defects appear more frequently than in the strained binary crystal . for a qualitative comparison",
    ", we devise a simplified cluster criterion for the one - component crystal , where neighboring particles form a cluster if they each have either five or seven nearest neighbors , thus distorting the sixfold symmetry of the ideal lattice .",
    "thereby , we cover isolated and bound dislocations as well as entangled chains .",
    "figure [ fig_break_mono ] depicts the creation and annihilation of clusters .",
    "+ recent studies on the plastic deformation of amorphous media have explicitly demonstrated a characteristic stress signature and spatial correlation of plastic events @xcite , corresponding to earlier theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "encouraged by these findings , we assess the local stress signature of cluster creation events , which play the role of plastic events in the breaking of the s(@xmath7 ) crystal .",
    "intriguingly , our results are in qualitative agreement with the stress signature observed in an amorphous system of polydisperse hard spheres under shear @xcite and in flowing emulsions near jamming @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig_stress_signature ] . additionally , we probe the spatial correlation of cluster appearances and recover a non - vanishing spatial correlation along two distinct directions , which are aligned parallel and perpendicular to the direction of shear flow , respectively , see fig .",
    "[ fig_corr ] .",
    "this finding is in agreement with the observation that the s(@xmath7 ) crystal may develop cracks in the lateral or vertical direction , as discussed above .",
    "a similar spatial correlation of defect creation sites was not observed for the reference case of a sheared one - component crystal .     and @xmath19 .",
    "the colorcode corresponds to the stress increase with respect to the previous configuration for particles at a given distance to the trigger particle at @xmath99,@xmath100 .",
    "the fourfold pattern qualitatively corresponds to recent findings for polydisperse hard spheres under shear @xcite and flowing emulsions near jamming @xcite . ]",

    "the colorcode corresponds to the probability for a cluster to emerge at a particular relative position @xmath101 with respect to a previous cluster creation at @xmath102 .",
    "colors are specified by the bar at the bottom . ]",
    "we have analyzed the shear - induced breaking of a thermal binary model crystal on the particle - scale level using brownian dynamics computer simulations .",
    "thus , we have established that the macroscopic breakage of the crystal originates in the spontaneous creation of defects in the initially defect - free crystal .",
    "the defects are visualized by a cluster criterion .",
    "our observations suggest that the emergence of defects is induced by a characteristic hierarchical interplay of the two particle species . in the strained crystal ,",
    "aligned fluctuations of the more strongly interacting @xmath0 particles along the strained lattice directions distort the potential energy landscape and induce plastic events , where the @xmath1 particles are pushed out of the unit cell .",
    "the likelihood of these events is increased if the shear direction is not aligned with the crystal orientation .",
    "further plastic events are triggered by vacancy diffusion until eventually , small clusters merge into an extended disordered region and initiate the macroscopic breakage of the crystal , during which pronounced nonaffine displacements are observed .",
    "this breaking scenario is in distinct contrast to the shear response of a one - component crystal near melting , where stress is released via the spontaneous creation and annihilation of dislocation pairs without spatially extended or persistent regions of structural disorder .",
    "furthermore , on a miscroscopic level , the breaking of the binary crystal under shear can be clearly distinguished from the melting of the crystal in the absence of shear .",
    "+ our observations suggest that various properties which are intrinsic to the plasticity of amorphous materials can be found in the breaking of a binary crystal , where the escape of @xmath1 particles from their cages induces a local loss of structure and allows for nonaffine rearrangements in the manner of an amorphous material .",
    "these properties include a fourfold stress signature of plastic events and a distinct , anisotropic spatial correlation of plastic events with respect to the shear direction .",
    "thus , our results shed new light on the study of solid plasticity , where crystalline and amorphous solids pose qualitatively different scenarios .",
    "our results imply that in the case of a multicomponent crystal - even in the simple case of a binary crystal - this qualitative difference does not fully apply due to a local amorphization of the crystal in the breaking zone .",
    "+ our predictions can be verified in binary suspensions of superparamagnetic colloidal particles at a pending air - water interface in an external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the shear can be imposed by a laser beam . for the future",
    ", one should explore more situations of shear - induced breaking .",
    "in particular , the case of small damping will be interesting as this is relevant for the melting of a dusty plasma crystal under shear ( have a look at our book for references ) .",
    "moreover , more interaction asymmetries , composition ratios and model potentials need to be explored .",
