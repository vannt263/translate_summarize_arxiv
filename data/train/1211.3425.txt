    "some of the greatest successes of the holographic dualities have been the computations of transport coefficients of strongly coupled quantum field theories , beginning with the work of @xcite .",
    "these computations replace a problem of large @xmath0 ( high dimensional gauge group ) , finite temperature , strongly coupled quantum gauge theory dynamics by the much simpler problem of analyzing classical green s functions in various black hole backgrounds with boundary conditions that reflect our understanding of response theory .",
    "the direct calculation of the transport coefficients in the strongly coupled quantum field theory is currently beyond reach .",
    "the main problem is that response theory at finite frequency requires us to solve the real time evolution of an interacting quantum system of many degrees of freedom . if this is done in a path integral by monte - carlo sampling , the dynamical situation we want to consider has a severe sign problem that is currently unsolved . in some instances there",
    "are workarounds ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "the calculation in @xcite and subsequent work is , to leading order and when properly normalized @xcite , completely independent of @xmath0 and all the precise details of the field theory . these are classical gravity computations in ads black hole backgrounds .",
    "corrections appear when the gravitational theory suffers quantum corrections , i.e. , when the curvature is large somewhere in planck units , or when the truncation to gravity breaks down , as when the black hole has curvature radii of order the string scale . in the dual field theory",
    ", this corresponds to finite @xmath0 or weak coupling . in such cases",
    "it may pay off to approach the problem from the other side of the duality , starting with a field theory hamiltonian and studying its dynamics and then examining its relation to the gravity limit .",
    "this paper falls into this category of work .    given our inability to solve",
    "strongly coupled quantum theories directly , we could instead try to drop the quantum adjective and solve `` strongly coupled classical theories . '' at first , this might seem impossible , but we have to consider that strong coupling in quantum theories also refers to the strength of the terms in the action that make the system non - linear , relative to the terms corresponding to a linear system .",
    "thus , the regime of interest in classical physics is that of a dynamical system in the very non - linear regime .",
    "we also want to study it at large @xmath0 . here",
    "we expect that the strong non - linearity will cause chaotic dynamics and that large @xmath0 should be understood as a thermodynamic limit , where the number of degrees of freedom grows as @xmath1 but some aspects of the dynamics are @xmath0-independent . beyond the existence of good thermodynamic state variables",
    ", we can look for collective modes to emerge , akin to hydrodynamic variables , that indicate collective time dependent dynamics also roughly independent of @xmath0 .",
    "classical non - linear field theories have an infinite number of degrees of freedom and suffer from the ultraviolet ( uv ) catastrophe .",
    "the uv catastrophe is cured by reintroducing the planck constant .",
    "indeed , this is how planck introduced the eponymous constant in the first place , giving birth to quantum mechanics .",
    "this would seem to stop this idea of studying classical non - linear field theory dynamics in its tracks .",
    "however , thinking of a field theory expanded in fourier modes , a finite @xmath2 freezes the dynamics of most of the modes to be in their ground state ( or their adiabatic ground state given a configuration of the low frequency modes ) .",
    "these frozen modes are those above a cutoff , which is determined by the dynamics and the initial conditions .",
    "so , one is only dealing with finitely many active degrees of freedom and the initial problem of an infinite number of degrees of freedom in field theory can be solved , if we only knew the precise details of how most of the degrees of freedom ",
    "freeze out . \"",
    "this problem is solved without any work if we study dynamical systems with finitely many degrees of freedom in the first place . in that case",
    ", we do nt need to address the uv catastrophe at all . in those systems , @xmath3 means that we are studying the system at large quantum numbers ( very large energies compared to the gap in systems with a discrete spectrum ) .",
    "this is a regime where typical states are well described by classical statistical mechanics . with this in mind ,",
    "our main purpose is to examine the real time classical statistical mechanics of certain matrix models that have finitely many degrees of freedom .",
    "this is exactly the same methodology as in molecular dynamics simulations ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) .",
    "we study both equilibrium configurations , with their associated equations of state , and also simple transport processes , or more precisely , out of equilibrium relaxation .",
    "we study the latter via fluctuations of the appropriate variables and by invoking the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "we discuss whether such classical models can be used to study holographic dualities , where we also have some gravitational information .",
    "that is , to what extent can the classical dynamics of large @xmath0 matrix models encode gravitational information ?",
    "more broadly , are the dynamics compatible with our expectations from string theory , including beyond the general relativity / supergravity regime ?",
    "we are not able to completely answer these questions , but do make some relevant qualitative comparisons and , especially in sec .",
    "[ sec : grav - int ] , offer some informed speculations on the full story , which is a subject of continued research .",
    "we work with the bfss @xcite and bmn @xcite matrix models , which have well known holographic dual descriptions .",
    "we simulate the real time classical dynamics of these models . in our simulations the generic late time behavior for the initial conditions we study are finite temperature , equilibrium configurations . for the reasons we discussed above , it is reasonable to treat these holographic matrix models classically at high temperatures , which is the regime of very large quantum numbers .",
    "the associated black holes have curvatures that are large in string units @xcite .",
    "thus , from the gravitational perspective we would be describing very stringy back holes with our analysis .    we also find that there are collective dynamical variables analogous to hydrodynamic degrees of freedom .",
    "that is , there are certain aspects of the near equilibrium dynamics that are independent of the number of microscopic degrees of freedom .",
    "this was not obviously guaranteed .",
    "hydrodynamics usually requires a geometric coarse graining of degrees of freedom confined to small regions .",
    "holographic systems are usually made of d - branes .",
    "the holographic degrees of freedom are the strings stretching between the branes , which are extended objects that generally do not localize to small volumes . in the case of ads bulk geometries ,",
    "even small regions on the ads boundary have infinitely large volumes in ads , so this issue does not apply directly .",
    "one does hydrodynamics on the boundary of ads and not in the bulk , as in @xcite . in the case of the bmn matrix model , the conformal boundary of the dual plane wave geometry",
    "has no spatial extent @xcite and so one can not have transport there . hence , hydrodynamic behavior is not an obvious possibility in this case .",
    "however , the membrane paradigm for black holes suggests that there should be transport phenomena for the degrees of freedom in the near horizon limit of our black hole type objects .",
    "we still have to fret about the possibility of a phase transition : that the classical regime of the matrix model ( at large @xmath0 ) has nothing to do with the black hole dynamics we would like to study . in @xcite the authors argued that the transition from branes or strings to black holes is a smooth process , which also suggests some form of collective behavior in the near horizon dynamics , but it might be very distorted from the classical gravity regime . see also @xcite , which also argues against any such phase transition at any finite @xmath0 or finite t hooft coupling .",
    "we are also motivated to study this problem by the fast scrambling conjecture of @xcite and the hope that we can find some numerical handle to study it that does not involve gravitational arguments in the first place . we are continuing the study that was initiated in @xcite , where some notion of fast classical scrambling was shown for the bmn matrix model .",
    "another analysis in the bfss matrix model was carried out in @xcite , which also showed fast classical thermalization in the bfss matrix model for some set of initial conditions",
    ". however , these studies are not in the same spirit as the sekino - susskind setup , which seems to fundamentally require @xmath4 in its formulation .",
    "unfortunately , we have nothing new to say in regards to this conjecture , even though the principal example that was argued to thermalize fast was exactly the bfss matrix model .",
    "the crucial property of the model , shared by the ones we study , was that all of its degrees of freedom are coupled to each other in the lagrangian .",
    "indeed , it has been argued in @xcite that non - commutative field theory , which makes the degrees of freedom more non - local , scrambles faster than the corresponding commutative version of the field theory dynamics , but this was again done via a gravitational computation .",
    "other attempts to study the fast scrambling conjecture directly include @xcite , which studies certain toy quantum mechanical models , but not holographic systems .",
    "see the series of papers @xcite for a more detailed treatment of holographic fast scramblers , though these do not study matrix models directly .",
    "the papers @xcite slightly predate the conjecture and study matrix model dynamics and thermodynamics perturbatively at weak - coupling , as well as the breakdown of perturbation theory , and so are complementary to this work .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : obsandsym ] we discuss the regime where our calculations are valid , and we discuss the classes of observables that can be considered as well as a discussion on what it means for such matrix model to behave hydrodynamically . in sec .",
    "[ sec : num ] we describe the algorithm we use to evolve configurations . of particular importance",
    "is that the dynamics requires a gauss law constraint , and our checks that the constraint is preserved to high accuracy . in sec .",
    "[ sec : thermal ] we show that the late time behavior of the matrix model dynamics seems to thermalize and we present tests of this property , we also solve a puzzle on how to compute the temperature , where two independent measurements at first glance seem to disagree . in sec .",
    "[ sec : chaos ] we compute the power spectra of interesting observables , especially in the bfss matrix model .",
    "we show that the autocorrelation functions of interesting observables have smooth power spectrum ( indicative of chaos ) and have a well defined large @xmath0 limit suggesting hydrodynamics behavior . in sec .",
    "[ sec : fac ] we study the large @xmath0 factorization of the statistical quantities of interest .",
    "we show numerically that in the classical dynamics various quantities behave to leading order as gaussians ( free fields ) and that a @xmath5 expansion is applicable to study various normalized correlation functions .",
    "finally we conclude .",
    "the objective of this paper is to study the classical dynamics of both the bfss and bmn matrix models and to see to what extent we can extract lessons about holography from this study .",
    "before we formulate our approach to that problem , we discuss the regime where our calculations are valid .    the regime where the four - dimensional @xmath6 sym theory is dual to a semi - classical ( super ) gravity theory is large @xmath0 and strong t hooft coupling @xcite .",
    "the strong coupling regime implies that @xmath7 , so it involves @xmath2 in a crucial way .",
    "one should be careful in interpreting this equation . in dimensions other than four , like our @xmath8 dimensional matrix models ,",
    "the yang - mills coupling constant has units , so the left hand side can not be compared to the right hand side without choosing a state and multiplying by appropriate quantum numbers to obtain a dimensionless ratio .",
    "if we choose a thermal state at temperature @xmath9 for an oscillator degree of freedom with angular frequency @xmath10 , we can ask if thermal fluctuations are larger than quantum fluctuations for that degree of freedom .",
    "this happens when @xmath11 .",
    "so , one can be in the small @xmath2 regime if the temperature is high enough . for relativistic quantum field theories",
    "there is always some @xmath10 where @xmath12 .",
    "such degrees of freedom would be responsible for the uv catastrophe .",
    "on the other hand , for oscillators with small @xmath10 the left hand side is much larger than the right hand side and the corresponding oscillators are at high occupation quantum numbers .",
    "the dynamics of these low frequency modes is controlled by classical physics .",
    "the classical world meets the quantum world in the intermediate regime . roughly speaking ,",
    "the correspondence principle in quantum mechanics should let us interpolate between the classical and the quantum regimes . in the bmn and the bfss matrix model we only have a finite number of degrees of freedom ,",
    "so the uv catastrophe issue is avoided , but we can still try to push the system to the correspondence limit , in a manner we describe below .",
    "typical quantum states are superpositions of position eigenstates , so if we are to match various physical quantities of the quantum system we should either average over positions or smear the classical states to a volume of @xmath2 for each canonical pair of variables . if the system is chaotic , most energy eigenstates behave as if they are thermal for sufficiently small subsystems @xcite ( one has to make allowances if there are conserved quantities which do nt thermalize ) , so the correspondence principle suggests that we should study the statistical properties of the thermal ensemble to study the coarse grained properties of the quantum states . in this paper",
    "we do not calculate anything in the regime where quantum effects start making a difference , but we keep in mind that in the end we want to understand the system in the quantum regime .",
    "now , let us go back to the bmn and bfss matrix models .",
    "the regime of interest for us is the large @xmath0 regime , as dictated by holography . in this regime",
    ", the number of degrees of freedom grows like @xmath1 .",
    "we will see that the large @xmath0 limit is not only a thermodynamic limit but that we also observe a kind of hydrodynamics .",
    "here we do nt mean thermodynamic limit in a formal , rigorous sense , but simply that we find various state variable that remain finite as @xmath0 grows .",
    "ideally , we should be able to show local equilibrium and transport to claim hydrodynamic behavior .",
    "unfortunately , we do nt know how to make such a formulation from first principles , as the degrees of freedom in these matrix models are essentially non - local .",
    "if we take one of the matrices of the matrix model , we can interpret the eigenvalues as positions of d - branes @xcite , while the off - diagonal elements are strings stretching between the branes . in the classical regime",
    "we are studying , all the off - diagonal modes are excited , so it is hard to define local quantities that could play the role of , e.g. , densities of d - particles .",
    "what we can do instead is add a faraway probe and determine what it sees . in the bfss matrix model such",
    "a formulation leads to an effective potential for the probe .",
    "the effective potential can be computed from traces of the configuration @xcite convolved with some green s functions that decay polynomially in the distance @xcite .",
    "this is a quantum computation where one integrates out the off - diagonal degrees of freedom connecting the probe to the configuration under study .",
    "this gives rise to gravitational interactions between general d - brane objects and gravitons ( the interactions between gravitons by integrating off - diagonal models is part of the original formulation of the bfss matrix model @xcite ) .",
    "the natural candidates for hydrodynamic variables are these traces of various products of matrices appearing in the effective potential .",
    "they act as moments of the distributions of matter in the effective potential for a faraway probe .",
    "we need to show that the dynamics of these collective modes are roughly independent of @xmath0 to justify calling their dynamics hydrodynamic .",
    "note that we only make claims about these collective degrees of freedom in a statistical sense , just as if we were considering the hydrodynamic variables of a system of molecules .",
    "since we will be studying mostly equilibrium configurations , all we have access to is the fluctuations of these variables .",
    "our results show these fluctuations have some dynamical properties independent of @xmath0 . specifically , we will study time dependent correlation functions of certain single trace observables .",
    "consider first a single trace operator @xmath13 } = \\operatorname{\\text{tr}}\\left ( x^{i_1 } x^{i_2 } \\dots \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath14 $ ] is a multi - index . in the brane picture",
    "this will be a source for some gravity field ( or more generally a closed string field ) .",
    "indeed , we usually find that @xmath13 } \\simeq \\int d^dx\\ , \\rho_\\alpha(x ) f(x),\\ ] ] where @xmath15 would be the local source of the field ( if such a notion makes sense ) , with its corresponding spin labels .",
    "this is convolved with some polynomial function of the @xmath16 , which we call @xmath17 , which can also carry angular momentum labels .",
    "together these would get combined into a multipole expansion labeled by the multi - index @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "we can decompose the product into spherical harmonics , and then symmetry considerations will tell us that if the configuration is spherically symmetric the averages of objects whose spin is non - zero vanishes . for",
    "many interesting observables we will have that the time average should vanish @xmath18 } \\rangle_t = 0,\\ ] ] although it does not do so configuration by configuration , but only as a time average .",
    "now , if we give two such observables @xmath19 , we can consider averages of the form @xmath20 where we average over a trajectory ( or a collection of such trajectories with the same energy ) .",
    "the correlation function @xmath21 will describe the statistical properties of the time dependent correlations between the observables .",
    "indeed , such a function will encode the fluctuation - dissipation information .",
    "such correlation functions can be different from zero , even if the individual expectation values of the @xmath22 vanish .",
    "this is similar to studying sound modes for gas in a cavity .",
    "if the individual harmonics are not excited , then their average is zero , but there will be thermal fluctuations . these fluctuations , when properly normalized , will have a good thermodynamic limit , but away from this limit there can be finite size effects that are sensitive to the number of particles .",
    "we will say the system behaves hydrodynamically if a collection of the @xmath21 properly normalized has a large @xmath0 limit where the collection @xmath21 converges to a single function of @xmath23 for fixed @xmath24 , and for a reasonable interval of time that is short compared to the poincar recursion time , but that can be much longer than any thermalization time ( or scrambling or relaxation time ) for near equilibrium dynamics .",
    "this may be too narrow a definition .",
    "consider a toy model of gas in a box with a somewhat random shape that is temperature dependent ( like a rubber balloon filled with an ideal gas ) .",
    "we would say that the hydrodynamic behavior there is independent of the box .",
    "however , let us imagine that we want to study hydrodynamics by looking at the normal modes of sound in the box , or other such decomposition into normal modes .",
    "if we change the temperature , we would change the shape of the box somewhat : the added pressure would deform the walls of the container .",
    "this would deform the harmonics of the box , and the collection of harmonics of the box would be temperature dependent .",
    "such changes can not be done while preserving the spectrum ( even after rescaling time ) .",
    "also , if we change the number of particles inside the box in such a way that the pressure stays the same , the shape of the box would not change .",
    "however , the temperature of the gas would change depending on the number of particles .",
    "in such a case , the modes of sound on the box would be independent of the temperature only after a rescaling of time , and the ratios of the different frequencies would be invariant , but not the frequencies themselves .",
    "our systems are somewhat analogous to this .",
    "after thermalization , the matrices will relax to an approximately spherically symmetric configuration about the center of mass .",
    "this is in the absence of angular momentum for the initial conditions ( we will not consider such initial conditions in this paper ) .",
    "these spherical configurations grow in size if we increase the temperature . in the bmn system the geometry of the plane wave in which the configuration is embedded acts like a box , similar to how",
    "ads acts like a mirror .",
    "if we increase the temperature the configuration grows in size and the external pressure changes .",
    "there is also an internal pressure that makes the system want to collapse : the excitation of the off - diagonal modes between the branes acts like a glue that makes the system shrink .",
    "if these are treated as harmonic oscillators , one would expect that each such harmonic oscillator has an energy of @xmath25 and that the energy stored in these configurations is independent of the position .",
    "however , as we move a d - particle far away from the system , the effective frequency of these modes goes up , and there is a corresponding shrinkage of the available phase space for these modes .",
    "thus , there is an entropy cost to move a d - particle away from the configuration and the internal pressure to hold the system together is an entropic force .",
    "it has been argued that this type of entropic effect leads to the gravitational force near the horizon of a black hole @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , thermal pressure makes the system expand .",
    "these two forces can reach an equilibrium . in the very high temperature limit",
    "we expect that the internal pressure dominates over the external pressure , so that the shape of the container matters less , but we will not be able to guarantee that the system is hydrodynamic without fine tuning : we would need to be able to match the box shapes between different values of @xmath0 . doing this carefully requires a fairly detailed understanding of the phase diagram of the system .",
    "all of this is much simpler to study in the bfss matrix model .",
    "one can show that the classical dynamics of the bfss model has a scaling property : a configuration at a given energy can be rescaled to any other energy by a rescaling of time and the matrix components .",
    "thus , it does not matter at what energy we study the system as the dynamics is essentially the same .",
    "so we have gotten rid of the temperature - dependent shape parameters .",
    "because of this , we can argue that the dynamics of the thermal system only depends on @xmath0 and we can explore how the dynamics depends on @xmath0 and no other variables . for of this reason , we analyze the large @xmath0 limit primarily in the bfss matrix model .",
    "the numerical implementation has been discussed previously in @xcite .",
    "we work with a leapfrog algorithm and we indicate how to implement the constraints in the initial conditions . here",
    "we reiterate the algorithm .",
    "the bosonic degrees of freedom of the bmn and bfss matrix model are the hermitian matrices @xmath26 and @xmath27 and their canonical conjugates @xmath28 and @xmath29 . the bosonic part of the hamiltonian is @xmath30 ^ 2 - \\frac{1}{2}[y^a , y^b]^2 \\big ) .",

    "we get the bfss matrix model .",
    "we have rescaled the variables so that the classical equations of motion are independent of @xmath2 and all the quantum mechanics is hidden in the initial conditions .",
    "we have also normalized the mass of @xmath34 to one , _ i.e. _ , we measure time by the oscillation period of one of the @xmath34 modes .    because of the @xmath35 gauge symmetry we must enforce the gauss law constraint : @xmath36 + [ y^a , q_a ] = 0\\ , .",
    "\\nonumber\\ ] ] to solve the equations of motion we use a leapfrog algorithm .",
    "this has the virtue of preserving the constraints .",
    "the discretized matrix equations of motion read @xmath37 and similarly for the @xmath38 modes . since we have the @xmath39 , @xmath28 evaluated at different times , we need to be a little careful with the constraint .",
    "we define @xmath40 + [ y^a(t ) , q_a(t+t/2)]\\ ] ] and will set it to zero in the initial conditions .",

    "we need to work harder , but so long as @xmath44 is a sum of traces of products of @xmath34 and @xmath38 matrices ( or functions of such traces ) , one can prove that the contribution from each such trace vanishes by summing cyclically over the letters making the word in the trace . hence , @xmath45 and this tells us that @xmath46 is a constant of motion of the discrete evolution . incidentally , the same arguments work for angular momentum conservation laws .",
    "our initial conditions are those for ( near ) zero angular momentum .",
    "the only place where constraint violations might appear is from rounding errors , so we need to check that we do nt suffer from this problem . to improve numerical stability we use double precision numbers . to check for numerical errors , we record the absolute value of the constraint @xmath47 as a check for the code .",
    "we find that the constraint is well satisfied for the runs we perform , so we do not need to implement constraint damping .",
    "the equations of motion evolve hermitian matrices into hermitian matrices .",
    "truncation errors in matrix multiplication can also take us away from that locus .",
    "we found that we needed to enforce hermiticity of the matrices every few steps , by taking @xmath48 and similarly for all other matrices .",
    "we do this every time we write the matrix configurations .",
    "the main sources of difficulty in the setup are the initial conditions . for this paper",
    ", we have used the following initial classical configurations : @xmath49 in the bmn matrix model .",
    "these are the same initial conditions that were used in @xcite , where they are explained in detail .",
    "the important point is that the @xmath50 and @xmath51 are generated by gaussian distributions controlled by a classical estimate of the quantum uncertainty of the modes which is parametrized by @xmath2 .",
    "this is only used in the initial conditions and is similar to the standard practice in molecular dynamics simulations @xcite .    to study the bfss matrix model , we first evolve in the bmn matrix model and some time later we set @xmath33 and study the further evolution of the system .",
    "once we are in the bfss matrix model , we have further dynamical information : the classical system enjoys a scale invariance .",
    "thus , results at one energy are completely equivalent to results at higher or lower energies ( there is no temperature dependence on quantities , other than those dictated by scaling ) and the only variable we have is @xmath0 .",
    "this makes it easy to compare different values of @xmath0 to each other after proper rescaling .",
    "in this situation we can test convergence of quantities as we increase @xmath0 in a temperature independent way .",
    "we store the full configurations of the matrices every few steps in @xmath52 ( for the data sets we present here we set this number to ten unless otherwise stated ) , and we store other information for faster processing at different intervals .",
    "this is especially important for long simulations .",
    "we will call machine time the total run in the simulation in units of the smallest time step that is recorded .",
    "our results for the constraint violation can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : conv ] .    , and after normalization it shows larger fluctuations for smaller @xmath0 .",

    "it was shown that the binned eigenvalues collected over time follow the semicircular distribution for random matrices , as is expected for random gaussian matrices in the large @xmath0 limit . here",
    "we explore in more detail the nature of the thermalization , the appropriate finite @xmath0 gibbs distribution , and the design of a correctly calibrated thermometer .     as a function of time for a simulation of rank 8 matrices with @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",

    "in this section we discuss the extent to which we can call the thermalized classical dynamics of the matrix model a black hole .",

    "if not for the time warping , a string that stretches to the brane , at the origin , would have infinite mass .",
    "this means the region near @xmath106 can be considered a large volume , in string units , and we are justified in dropping the @xmath108 in . as noted in @xcite , the string coupling remains finite as we take the near horizon , decoupling limit . for @xmath109 , which is the case of interest",
    "given the @xmath78 symmetry of the bfss system , the effective curvature becomes large for large @xmath100 , and is small near @xmath106 .",
    "now imagine adding energy to this system and creating a black hole with the same asymptotics as this background .",
    "these black holes have positive specific heat .",
    "if the temperature is low , the curvature of the black hole near the horizon is small in string units @xcite . because the dilaton runs in these geometries towards small coupling in the uv , the effective string scale depends on the position , and",
    "the curvature becomes large in string units in the uv .",
    "correspondingly , the curvature will be large in string units if the temperature is high , so the high temperature black hole is stringy .",
    "the regime of interest for us is high temperature , where the curvature near the putative back hole is large and where stringy corrections must be important . in the spirit of @xcite",
    ", we should be able to describe that region by replacing the black holes by configurations of d - branes , because we are in the stringy regime .",
    "the classical dynamics we studied is the microscopic , classical dynamics of the d - brane configurations .",
    "these configurations with d - brane sources are horizonless in the sense of classical gravity , but when the system cools enough we recover a black hole .",
    "this notion that we recover a black hole when we cool the system down is the reverse of the scenario in @xcite , where the authors argued that a black hole that becomes small enough to become stringy is replaced by a set of strings and possibly d - branes .",
    "we assume that this philosophy is applicable in this case as well , as there is no reason to expect a phase transition and we can corroborate this by examining the scalings of various quantities with respect to @xmath0 and @xmath9 .    from our calculations via the virial theorem , we know that the radius of the brane configurations in the classical system grows as @xmath110 , so the effective ( codimension two ) size covered by the brane system scales as @xmath111 .",
    "the energy is of order @xmath112 whereas the entropy of the d - brane gas is of order @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is some reference temperature whose precise value does nt concern us here . as computed in @xcite , for low temperatures",
    "the entropy scales as @xmath115 and the free energy scales as @xmath116 .",
    "the smooth transition to the brane gas occurs near @xmath117 in their units . since for the black brane we have the usual area law for the entropy @xmath118 , for @xmath119 we have @xmath120",
    "so the brane gas extends all the way to where we would imagine the black hole horizon to be .",
    "the entropy in both cases is of order @xmath1 , as well as their energy , so there is no gap between the energy or entropy scalings that would suggest a phase transition .",
    "this is the essence of the argument in @xcite for smooth interpolation between strings and black hole physics .",
    "furthermore , that the configuration reaches the same radius as where the black hole horizon would be located is very similar to the fuzzball geometries ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "this suggests that the system can be described both as a black hole and as a collection of d - branes .",
    "if the transition between the descriptions is smooth , we can choose one or the other depending on the question we want to ask .",
    "now we want to consider the dissipation we observe , in the sense of decaying correlations , in our simulations . as shown in our fig .",
    "[ fig : collapse ] , for all @xmath0 we get a very similar power spectrum of fluctuations . applying fluctuation - dissipation relations , we can use these to characterize response functions .",
    "if we were to match to gravity , valid at lower temperatures , we would expect dissipation to be related to the presence of quasinormal modes associated with a black hole horizon .",
    "we expect the point of comparison between both descriptions to be the analytic structure of correlation functions and power spectra , such as those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : collapse ] .",
    "as shown in the figure , there are many suggestive straight lines that describe the logarithm of the power spectrum .",
    "remember also that the power spectrum is symmetric about @xmath121 .",
    "the most naive fit to the graph near @xmath122 is @xmath123 the absolute value is not an analytic function of the complex variable @xmath10 and the fourier transform of eq .",
    "only decays polynomially at large times .",
    "if the singularity is smoothed out very near @xmath124 , one can imagine that an analytic function of @xmath10 replaces @xmath125 .",
    "the simplest such function is @xmath126 . when @xmath127 we recover the result above .",
    "the presence of @xmath128 suggests a pair of branch cuts beginning near @xmath129 along the imaginary axis .",
    "if these are the closest singularities to the real axis , then the function decays exponentially in time .",
    "thus , even if the ultimate late time fate of the system has correlation functions that decay exponentially in time , there can be a long transient where the decays of the correlation functions are only polynomial .",
    "a square root branch cut can be approximated by a density of poles ( this is often seen in matrix models @xcite ) .",
    "since we only have the analytic function on the real numbers , extrapolating to find the poles requires a very good understanding of the analytic structure of the function and the pattern of pole locations . just for comparison , another similar function",
    "would be given by @xmath130 where @xmath59 , @xmath131 are complex conjugates of each other .",
    "this is real on the real axis and has four branch cuts near the origin starting at @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "such branch cuts could indicate a series of poles along straight lines , starting from the brach cut endpoints and going towards infinity .",
    "such patterns of quasinormal modes aligning on fairly straight curves have been observed in schwarzschild and ads black holes @xcite .",
    "a particularly nice set of examples can be found in @xcite , fig . 4 , and @xcite .",
    "in gravity setups such patterns are interpreted in terms of the membrane paradigm @xcite .",
    "our results suggest that there is agreement between our analytics and the existence of a large collection of quasinormal modes for each @xmath134 near @xmath135",
    ". we might eventually be able to interpret them as shear or sound modes once we understand the details of how these modes are mapped into each other .",
    "notice that as we increase @xmath134 , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : pow27 ] , the curves become flatter near @xmath135 for even @xmath134 , suggesting that the corresponding poles nearest to the origin are moving away from the real axis .",
    "this suggests that there is a dispersion relation for the frequencies @xmath136 of these poles such that @xmath137 increases with @xmath134 . here",
    "@xmath134 is angular momentum about the sphere of the spherical black hole geometry , so such a dispersion relation could be interpreted geometrically , but we havent made this precise yet : in the absence of a theory of where these poles and branch cuts should be located , any match to a dispersion relation would be mere speculation .",
    "the analytic structure of the power spectra of observables in a chaotic dynamical system is generally controlled by poles off the real axis known as pollicot - ruelle resonances .",
    "the locations of these are known for some simple systems , but finding them in general , even for very low dimensional systems , is difficult ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for large systems with many degrees of freedom there are expected to be accumulations of poles and also branch cuts @xcite , in line with our discussion above .",
    "more detailed information on the analytic structure may be difficult to obtain , but we plan to analyze this in more detail in the future .",
    "we also note the other lines drawn in the fig .",
    "[ fig : collapse ] , which suggest similar interpretations for the other peaks as modes whose frequencies begin with a non - zero real part .",
    "we do not have a theory for the analytic structure of the power spectra , but based on the data and our general understanding of dissipative phenomena we have speculated that there are branch cuts in the analytically continued spectra . given the behavior of black hole horizons , as in the membrane paradigm and as characterized by the quasinormal modes , we think our numerical data are consistent with having a smooth transition from the matrix configurations to a black hole at low temperatures .",
    "let us first summarize our observations from our numerical simulations of the bmn and bfss matrix models .",
    "the dynamics of the matrix models are chaotic .",
    "there are strong indications that the systems thermalize , most prominently that the typical matrices of the momentum and position variables behave , at late times , as random matrices from the traceless gue ensemble .",
    "this is expected for the momentum matrices because the hamiltonian is quadratic in the relevant degrees of freedom , but because of the nonlinearities in the potential we would not immediately guess this for the position matrices .",
    "we also showed how the presence of constraints alters the naive arguments about the appropriate random matrix ensembles for these systems .",
    "we have seen that certain observables behave hydrodynamically , i.e. , their power spectra at equilibrium are approximately independent of the total number of degrees of freedom and they have approximately gaussian statistics .",
    "we have also seen that large @xmath0 counting applies to time correlation functions between observables , so that violations of gaussianity scale like @xmath5 , i.e. , there is factorization of these degrees of freedom .",
    "this @xmath5 scaling is associated with quantum corrections under the usual ads / cft power counting arguments .",
    "these particular matrix models are interesting because of their dual gravitational interpretation .",
    "though quantum effects are crucial to the emergent gravitational dynamics in general , we have argued that at high temperatures the classical dynamics of these matrix models do encode certain dual gravitational phenomena , including black holes , albeit in a stringy regime . as such ,",
    "a direct comparison with supergravity solutions is not possible , but we can look for and have found some qualitative agreement .    the first level of correspondence is between black holes , broadly defined to include large stringy corrections , and equilibrium thermal states in these models .",
    "this thermodynamic correspondence was referred to in both of the seminal papers on bfss matrix theory and ads / cft @xcite and subsequently investigated and verified in many situations .",
    "the main work of this paper has been the identification of high temperature equilibrium configurations in the matrix models and some investigation of their equations of state and fluctuations , in the manner of a molecular dynamics simulation .",
    "this is a continuation of the work first presented in @xcite . as a first step toward a more detailed correspondence ,",
    "we have presented evidence here that the approximate analytic structure we find in the power spectra of certain observables at large @xmath0 could be the remnant of the quasinormal modes of supergravity black holes .",
    "this is suggested by the numerical data , where the results we find on the real axis seem to be well approximated by functions that , when analytically continued , would have branch cuts in the complex plane .",
    "these could be an approximation of a sequence of roughly evenly spaced poles .",
    "it is possible to study the geometry that emerges from these matrix models in more detail , for example by using the methods presented recently in @xcite . such geometric data is based on probe branes and the fermionic degrees of freedom that connect them to the configurations we have shown here .",
    "this information would complement what is done here very nicely and we can speculate that in the future such reasoning will lead us to understand the emergence of gravitational horizons from such dynamics better .",
    "we also seek to investigate the dissipation and other transport properties further .",
    "for example , the time autocorrelation functions of various observables , such as those displayed in fig . [",
    "fig : correlation ] , can be integrated to compute the associated transport coefficients , via the green - kubo relations .",
    "we can then investigate how these depend on the temperature , @xmath0 , or other variables , and see whether the behavior can be interpreted holographically and meets our expectations from gravity .",
    "we note that these transport phenomena are related to the chaotic dynamics of the system , characterized by quantities such as the lyapunov exponents , pollicot - ruelle resonances , and kolmogorov - sinai entropy ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) .",
    "these quantities also control the far from equilibrium dynamics . in that vein",
    ", we may be able to profitably study other non - equilibrium phenomena by applying further techniques and results from non - equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "reflecting on what we have accomplished here , we have made a modest attempt at reconciling gravitational dynamics in holographic setups with the theory of chaotic dynamical systems .",
    "we have argued that these types of analyses do cover interesting black holes in the stringy regime , which would mean the study of these situations is forced on us if we want to be complete . from this vantage point , we have barely scratched the surface of what can be computed and analyzed and it would be interesting to pursue this further to improve our understanding of holography .",
    "these simulations of the classical dynamics provide new ways to address questions about black holes in simple systems where the numerical computations are easily implemented .",
    "it is also important to understand how to move away from the correspondence limit , which would mean quantum dynamics starts becoming important and the dynamics of fermions starts affecting the results . in such setups the tools of quantum chaos",
    "will play an increasingly important role .",
    "this is closely related to the question of whether at low temperatures it is the fermionic degrees of freedom that dominate , or if they only play a marginal role in most of the dynamical regimes of interest .",

    "<S> we show evidence for thermalization by matching the time - averaged distributions of the matrix eigenvalues to the distributions of the appropriate traceless gaussian unitary ensemble of random matrices . </S>",
