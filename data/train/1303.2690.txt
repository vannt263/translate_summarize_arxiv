    "the milky way ( mw ) and andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) are the dominant galaxies in the local group ( lg )",
    ". astronomical observations of their mass distribution impose constraints on the standard cosmological model .",
    "the satellite overabundance problem @xcite , tidal disruption features @xcite and the disk dominated morphology @xcite are examples of how lg studies are linked to the cosmological context .",
    "detailed studies on the magellanic clouds dynamics and their possible link to m31 add to the interest of understanding the details of the lg kinematics and dynamics @xcite .",
    "however , a general concern in the use of the lg as a tool for near - field cosmology @xcite is how typical is the lg regarding the properties of interest @xcite .",
    "a new valuable piece of information in this issue is the recent observational determination of the proper - motion measurements of m31 , which until recently had been out of reach @xcite .",
    "the reported measurements set an upper bound for the tangential velocity of m31 with respect to the mw of @xmath17 km s@xmath1 .",
    "together with the values of the relative radial velocity of @xmath18 km  s@xmath1observations show that the relative motion of the mw and andromeda is consistent with a head - on collision . with this information it is possible to quantify how common such a kinematic configuration is in a @xmath3cdm universe .",
    "this letter presents such a study .",
    "we use a large volume , high resolution dark matter only n - body simulation in the concordance @xmath3cdm cosmology to find a set of halo pairs with similar characteristics as inferred in the lg .",
    "we quantify these results in terms of the number of pairs with given radial and tangential velocities in the galactocentric rest frame .",
    "we also find the pairs that are consistent with a head on collision in terms of the ratio of the radial to tangential velocity @xmath19 and present these results in terms of the reduced angular momentum , mechanical energy and dimensionless spin parameter .",
    "in addition we make use of three constrained n - body simulations which are constructed to reproduce the observed large scale structure of the local universe on scales of a few tens of mpc .",
    "the special feature of these simulations is that each volume features a pair of halos with the right characteristics to be considered lg - like objects .",
    "this letter is structured as follows . in the next section we present the n - body simulations and the criteria we use to select lg - like halo pairs . in section [ sec : results ] we present the results for the dynamics in these pairs in terms of the tangential / radial velocities and the orbital angular momentum / mechanical energy . in the same section we summarize these dynamical results in terms of the dimensionless spin parameter of the pairs .",
    "finally , in the last section we comment and conclude about the implications of these results in the context of the @xmath3cdm model .",
    "the bolshoi simulation follows the non - linear evolution of the dark matter density field using n - body techniques .",
    "the simulation has a cubic comoving volume of @xmath20 , sampled with @xmath21 particles .",
    "the cosmological parameters used in the simulation are @xmath22 and @xmath23 , corresponding to the matter density , vacuum energy density , the normalization of the power spectrum , the dimensionless hubble constant and the index of the slope in the initial power spectrum .",
    "this set of parameters is compatible with the analysis of the seventh year of data from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of this simulation can be found in @xcite .    with these parameters",
    "the mass per particle is @xmath24 . in this paper",
    "we use halos obtained through the bound density maxima ( bdm ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "the halos are selected to have an overdensity of 200 times the critical density .",
    "furthermore , we only include in the analysis halos whose center is located outside the virial radius of any other halo .",
    "we have obtained the data through the public available multidark database @xcite .",
    "the database allows us to obtain the comoving positions , peculiar velocities and masses for all the halos in the simulation volume at @xmath25 .",
    "the positions and velocities of these haloes correspond to the average values of the @xmath26 most bound particles .",
    "the hubble flow is taken into account to convert the peculiar velocities into physical velocities and allow for a comparison with observations .",
    "we have verified that the main conclusions of this paper hold in the case of halos defined by a fof algorithm with a linking length 0.17 times the mean interparticle distance .",
    "the constrained simulations we use in this letter are part of the constrained local universe simulations ( clues ) project whose main objective is to reproduce the large scale structure in the local universe as accurately as possible . the algorithm and observational constraints to construct the initial conditions are described in @xcite .",
    "we use three dark matter only simulations , each has a cubic volume of @xmath27on a side , with the density field sampled with @xmath28 particles .",
    "the cosmological density parameter is @xmath29 , the cosmological constant @xmath30 , the dimensionless hubble parameter @xmath31 , the spectral index of the primordial density perturbations @xmath32 and the power spectrum normalization @xmath33 , also consistent with wmap 7th year data .",
    "based on the bdm catalogs in the bolshoi simulation we construct a halo pair sample with the dynamical properties consistent with those of the mw and m31 .",
    "the criteria we impose to define a lg - like halo pair are the following :    1 .",
    "each halo has a mass in the range @xmath34 .",
    "2 .   with respect to each halo",
    ", there can not be any other halo within the mass range @xmath34 closer than its partner .",
    "it means that there can not be ambiguity on the identity of the pair members .",
    "the relative radial velocity between the two halos is negative @xcite .",
    "4 .   the distance between the center of mass of the halos must be less than @xmath35mpc @xcite .",
    "there can not be halos more massive than @xmath36 within a radius of @xmath10mpc with respect to every object centre @xcite .",
    "there can not be halos more massive than @xmath37 within a radius of @xmath38mpc with respect to every object centre @xcite .    throughout this letter",
    "we refer to this sample as the full sample .",
    "this sample in the bolshoi simulation has @xmath39 pairs . additionally , there is a sample of three ( 3 ) pairs constructed from the three constrained realizations .",
    "these pairs fulfill all the above mentioned conditions and additionally are located in a place with the right distances with respect to the virgo cluster in the simulation .",
    "the full observational characteristics that we take in this letter for the mw - m31 pair are listed in table [ table:1 ] .",
    "a more reduced sample from the full sample has been constructed so as to obey the observational bounds on the masses and separation of the two main halos .",
    "these amount to :    1 .",
    "the separation between the center of mass of the halos is in the range @xmath40kpc @xcite .",
    "the total mass of the two halos is in the range @xmath41@xcite .    including these conditions the full sample",

    "[ table:3 ]      figure [ fig : rt ] summarizes the central finding of this letter .",
    "most of the pairs in the two samples constructed from the bolshoi simulation have radial and tangential velocities notably different from the observational constraints at the 1-@xmath4 level .",
    "the most probable radial and tangential velocities in @xmath3cdm are summarized in table [ table:2 ] . for the full sample we have @xmath51 km  s@xmath1and @xmath52 km  s@xmath1 . for the reduced sample @xmath53 km  s@xmath1and @xmath52 km  s@xmath1 , where the uncertainties in these values reflect the minimum grid size needed to obtain robust statistics for the 2d histogram .",
    "the number of pairs compatible with lg observations at the 1-@xmath4 level are listed in table [ table:3 ] ( columns 2 and 3 ) . in the same table ( columns 4 and 5 ) we summarize the number of pairs around the @xmath3cdm values within the same range of absolute observational uncertainty ( i.e. @xmath54 km  s@xmath1and @xmath55 km  s@xmath1 . )    from these results we infer that the pairs around the preferred phase space for @xmath3cdm are at least @xmath11 times more common than pairs with the observed velocities for the lg .",
    "we highlight that this is a lower bound given that in the reduced sample none of the pairs is found in the interval allowed by observations .",
    "the high eccentric orbit of the observed lg constitutes an unlikely configuration for the @xmath3cdm lg - like objects .",
    "this holds for the full and the reduced sample of objects .",
    "these conclusions are valid at 1-@xmath4 level in the observational uncertainties .",
    "an equivalence in the abundance between the pairs around the observational values and those around the preferred @xmath3cdm velocities is reached only at the 4-@xmath4 level on the observational uncertainties .    from figure",
    "[ fig : rt ] it is also clear that there is a significant number of pairs with a high tangential - to - radial velocity ratio .",
    "the peak in the pair number density is located around a region of @xmath56 , while the observations suggest @xmath57 .",
    "as summarized in table [ table:3 ] we find that only between @xmath58 to @xmath59 of the pairs are consistent with the observational constraint .",
    "the three pairs from the constrained realizations are also show higher @xmath60 ratios than observations : @xmath61 .",
    "the two - body problem of point - like masses can serve as a proxy for the dynamics of the lg and can be used as a tool for studying the lg within the framework of the standard cosmological model . within the model",
    "the dynamics of the lg is governed by the ( center of mass ) reduced angular momentum @xmath62 and reduced energy @xmath63 , where the total mass is @xmath64 , the reduced mass is @xmath65 and @xmath66 is the gravitational constant .",
    "this formulation has a clear theoretical advantage if one considers the angular momentum and the mechanical energy as quasi - conserved dynamical quantities .",
    "this means that , after some formation time , these quantities do not significantly evolve .",
    "however , this formulation has an observational disadvantage . the reduced energy and angular momentum",
    "are derived from very different kinds of observations , increasing the uncertainties in their final determination .",
    "we use monte carlo sampling to estimate the reduced energy and angular momentum from the observed properties in the lg listed in table[table:1 ] .",
    "lower panels in figure [ fig : rt ] also presents the results in the plane @xmath67 contour in the lower panels of figure [ fig : rt ] does not cross the zero level , as can be naively expected from figure [ fig : rt ] .",
    "this happens for the @xmath68 contour level . ] . as expected , the @xmath5 and @xmath6 constraints are less restrictive compared with the radial and tangential velocity constraints ; 15% ( 24% ) of pairs in the full ( reduced ) sample obey the 1-@xmath4 observational constraints .",
    "we note that for the reduced sample the preferred region is outside the 1-@xmath4 observational contours .",
    "all the constrained lgs of the full and reduced sample are consistent with the 1-@xmath4 observational uncertainty .",
    "however a an hypothetical increase by a factor of @xmath69 in accuracy of the tangential velocity , showing that it is below @xmath70 km  s@xmath1 , would bring these pairs and the @xmath3cdm expectation outside this uncertainty region .",
    "the dimensionless spin parameter @xmath7 @xcite is used here to characterize the dynamical state of the observed and simulated lgs .",
    "the parameter measures the dynamical role of the angular momentum in terms of the gravitational attraction and is defined by    @xmath71    we compare the distribution for @xmath7 obtained from the pair population in the bolshoi simulation and the distribution from the monte carlo simulation used to estimate the uncertainties on @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "figure [ fig : lambda ] shows the likelihood distribution of the observational errors and the spin parameter of the lg - like pairs of the full ( left panel ) and the reduced ( right panel ) samples .",
    "the value of @xmath7 of the constrained lgs is shown as well .",
    "the expected observational value for @xmath7 is slightly inconsistent with the statistics derived from halo pairs in @xmath3cdm .",
    "the spin parameter of the simulated lg - like objects is skewed towards higher values compared with the observational estimation .",
    "inspection of figure [ fig : lambda ] also shows that the @xmath7 distribution is close to a log - normal one and thus resembles the distribution of the spin parameter of dm halos in simulation @xcite .",
    "the estimated value of @xmath46 of the observed lg is @xmath72 , lower than the mean value of @xmath46 of @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) for the full ( reduced ) sample .",
    "the values of the spin parameter of the 3 constrained lgs are @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , with the latter value belonging to the sole constrained lg of the reduced sample .",
    "we have presented a comparison between the observed kinematics for the m31 in the galactocentric rest - frame and the expectations for a large n - body cosmological simulation in the @xmath3cdm cosmology . in the simulation",
    "we select a large sample of pairs that fulfill isolation criteria for the lg .",
    "we select a sub - sample which obeys more stringent observational constraints on the mass and separation of the mw and m31 .    while the observations show that m31 moves towards us on a highly eccentric orbit , the simulation shows that the most common configuration at @xmath25 has values @xmath78 km  s@xmath1and @xmath79 km  s@xmath1 , where the error bars are estimated to include the results from the two pair samples .    using the same absolute values for the uncertainty in the observed velocity components ,",
    "we find that none of the halos in the reduced sample are compatible with observations .",
    "this makes pairs with the preferred @xmath3cdm values at least @xmath11 times more common than pairs compatible with the observational constraint .",
    "additionally , pairs with a fraction of tangential to radial velocity @xmath57 ( similar to observations ) represent @xmath58 to @xmath59 of the pairs",
    ".    approximating the lg as two point masses we express the above mentioned results in terms of the orbital angular momentum @xmath80 and the mechanical energy @xmath5 per unit of reduced mass .",
    "we find that the uncertainties in the tangential velocity , the square of the norm of the velocity and the total mass in the lg are less constraining on the number of simulated pairs that are consistent with the observations .",
    "nevertheless , in the case of the reduced sample there is a slight tension between simulation and observation .",
    "a reduction by a factor of @xmath69 in the observational uncertainty on the radial velocity would clarify this issue .",
    "we also use the @xmath7 spin parameter to gauge the dynamical state of pairs .",
    "the values for the orbital angular momentum and energy , merged into the @xmath7 spin parameter , are in mild disagreement with the observational constraints .    in the three pairs from constrained simulations we find kinematics dominated by radial velocities .",
    "however their velocity components differ from the observational constraints and their mechanical energy and orbital angular momentum are in broad concordance with observations .",
    "there is only one pair that fulfills all the separation , total mass constraints and matches the most probable value for the dimensionless spin parameter @xmath7 inferred from observations .",
    "summarizing , we see a broad agreement in the total angular momentum and energy and a marked difference with the precise balance between today s radial and tangential velocities , i.e. head - on collisions of mw - like halos , as described by 1-@xmath4 uncertainties in observations , are not common in @xmath3cdm .    under the approximation of conservation of the orbital angular momentum and mechanical energy ,",
    "this could only be explained if the initial conditions for the formation of the local group are special in comparison to the initial conditions of any other pair of dark matter halos in the @xmath3cdm cosmology . investigating this perspective , by a thorough characterization of the small pair sample consistent with observations in terms of halo properties such as concentration , spin and place in the cosmic web @xcite is underway ( bustamante et al . in prep . ) .",
    "the results presented in this letter open a new window into the question of how unique , if at all , is the lg in a cosmological context .",
