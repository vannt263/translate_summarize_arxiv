    "evidence suggests that in a collision between ultra - relativistic heavy nuclei , a strongly - interacting , low - viscosity fluid  the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp )  is created .",
    "the clearest indication of this behavior is seen in the azimuthal anisotropy  @xcite among the bulk of emitted particles . in theory",
    ", one characterizes this anisotropy in terms of a single - particle probability distribution for each collision event . by writing this distribution as a fourier series with respect to the azimuthal angle of outgoing particles @xmath5 , one can define flow coefficients @xmath6 and event plane angles @xmath7 : @xmath8 where the brackets indicate an average over the single particle probability , and the event plane angles @xmath7 are chosen such that @xmath6 are the ( positive ) magnitudes of the complex fourier coefficients .    experimentally , one measures the azimuthal dependence of event - averaged correlations between detected particles .",
    "these measurements indicate the presence of a very large `` elliptic flow '' coefficient @xmath0  @xcite , which typically can only be reproduced in calculations where the system is modeled as a strongly - interacting fluid . in this picture , the large momentum anisotropy is generated as a hydrodynamic response to the spatial anisotropy of the nuclear overlap region in collisions of non - zero impact parameter .",
    "it even appears that the created quark - gluon plasma must be an almost perfect ( zero viscosity ) fluid , with a ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density @xmath9 that is at most a few times @xmath10 , a value that was famously conjectured to be a universal lower bound  @xcite .",
    "however , the extraction of a precise finite value is hampered by poor knowledge of the earliest stages of the collision , as well as other uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "an important recent development was the realization of the importance of quantum fluctuations , which in particular implies an event - by - event breaking of the symmetry naively implied by the collision of identical nuclei .",
    "specifically , the coefficients @xmath6 are generally non - zero also for odd @xmath11  @xcite , the event plane angles do not necessarily point in the same direction as the impact parameter  @xcite , and these quantities fluctuate significantly from one event to another , even at a fixed impact parameter  @xcite .",
    "these insights led to the possibility that _ all _ of the measured long - range correlations may be generated solely from collective behavior  @xcite .",
    "several new flow observables  specifically ones implied by the presence of event - by - event fluctuations  were recently measured for the first time  @xcite .",
    "studies of these new observables indicate that , individually , they indeed appear to have properties that are consistent with a hydrodynamic origin  @xcite .",
    "however , they have not yet all been reproduced in a single calculation within one model using a single set of parameters .",
    "this has left some lingering doubt about whether the interpretation in terms of collective behavior is indeed correct  @xcite .",
    "in addition , each measurement provides an independent constraint on theory , so identifying models and sets of parameters that can simultaneously satisfy all the constraints is a necessary first step in reducing various theoretical uncertainties . in this letter",
    "we perform state - of - the - art ideal hydrodynamic calculations and compare the results to the first measurements  @xcite of these new observables at relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) as well as previous measurements by the same collaboration  @xcite .",
    "other groups have presented calculations from some of these observables using event - by - event ideal  @xcite or viscous  @xcite hydrodynamics , or transport models  @xcite .",
    "the present study encompasses simultaneously , for the first time , all the measured flow observables at midrapidity .",
    "all the experimental results considered here were obtained using the event - plane method  @xcite . with this method , one first identifies an event plane @xmath7 in each event using a specific detector at forward rapidity , and then calculates the correlation of particles near midrapidity with this event plane , e.g. , @xmath12 where the brackets indicate an average over particles in a large number of events .",
    "a rapidity gap with the event - plane detector suppresses nonflow correlations  @xcite . at rhic ,",
    "`` triangular flow '' @xmath13 and `` quadrangular flow '' @xmath14 were measured for the first time , as a function of the particle transverse momentum @xmath15 in various centrality classes by the phenix collaboration  @xcite ( preliminary data from star have now also been presented  @xcite ) .",
    "previously , a different quadrangular flow observable has been measured , defined with respect to @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "we use a different notation for this quantity to avoid confusion : @xmath17        @xmath6 is analyzed using a large sample of events , and its value fluctuates from one event to the other . these fluctuations ( which were not appreciated when the method was developed ) , combined with the use of a finite sample of particles in the analysis , cause the measured value to deviate from the event average of the theoretical coefficients defined in eq .  .",
    "generally , @xmath18 lies between the mean value and the root - mean - square ( rms ) value of @xmath6 .",
    "one can parameterize the resulting measurement as  @xcite : @xmath19 where here the brackets indicate an average over events .",
    "the value of @xmath20 depends on the event plane resolution @xmath21  @xcite : if the resolution is poor , @xmath22 , and the measured @xmath6 is a rms value , while if the resolution is large , @xmath23 , and the result gets closer to the mean value .",
    "the most recent data from phenix has a maximum event plane resolution of 0.74 ( for @xmath0 around 30% centrality  @xcite ) and much smaller for @xmath1 and @xmath2  @xcite , which implies @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "so in general the results are very close to a rms value of @xmath6 .",
    "nevertheless , in the following we compute both limiting cases @xmath25 and @xmath26 in order to show the size of the effect of fluctuations on event - plane analyses .",
    "likewise , the measured value @xmath3 depends on the resolution  @xcite , and is usually close to @xmath27 , but with increasing resolution approaches @xmath28 .",
    "using the hydrodynamic code nexspherio  @xcite , we simulate top - energy au - au collisions at rhic .",
    "this code solves the equations of ideal relativistic hydrodynamics using fluctuating initial conditions from the event generator nexus  @xcite .",
    "nexus aims at a realistic and consistent approach of the initial stage of nuclear collisions  @xcite .",
    "it is a monte - carlo generator which takes into account not only the fluctuations of nucleon positions within nuclei  @xcite , but also fluctuations at the partonic level : the momentum of each nucleon is shared between one or several `` participants '' and a `` remnant '' , which implies non - trivial dynamical fluctuations in each nucleon - nucleon collisions . the resulting full energy - momentum tensor is matched to a hydrodynamic form , resulting in a fluctuating flow field in addition to a fluctuating initial energy density , in all three spatial dimensions , with the transverse length scale of the fluctuations set mostly by the size of the incoming nucleons .    at the end of the hydrodynamic evolution , discrete particles are emitted using a monte - carlo generator .",
    "nexspherio provides a good description of rapidity and transverse momentum spectra  @xcite , elliptic flow @xmath0  @xcite , and the rapidity - even @xmath29 observable , directed flow at midrapidity  @xcite . in addition",
    ", it is known to reproduce the long - range structures observed in two - particle correlations  @xcite .",
    "all parameters were fixed from these earlier investigations , before any of the new observables ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) were measured  nothing has been tuned here .    for this work , we generated 110 nexus events each in 5% centrality classes up to 60% centrality , solving the hydrodynamic equations independently for each event .",
    "as in ref .",
    "@xcite , at the end of each hydro event , we run the monte - carlo generator many times , so that we can do the flow analysis using approximately @xmath30 particles per event .",
    "this significantly reduces statistical noise and allows for an accurate determination of @xmath6 and @xmath7 in every event .",
    "it also suppresses non - flow correlations from , e.g. , particle decays .",
    "these quantities are then calculated by eq .",
    "( [ defvn ] ) , with the average taken over all particles in the pseudorapidity interval @xmath31 .",
    "the procedure used to measure @xmath6 in hydrodynamics thus mimics the experimental procedure , with two differences : ( i ) there is no need for a rapidity gap , because nonflow correlations are negligible ; ( ii ) there is no need for a resolution correction , because the huge multiplicity per event ensures that the resolution is close to 1 for all events  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : vn ] displays @xmath6 as a function of the particle transverse momentum @xmath15 , averaged over events in a centrality class .",
    "the average over events is estimated in two different ways in order to illustrate the effect of event - by - event flow fluctuations on the experimental analysis .",
    "the first estimate , labeled nexspherio- , is a plain mean value ( corresponding to @xmath26 in eq .  ) .",
    "the second estimate , labeled nexspherio+ is a weigthed average @xmath32 the average of @xmath33 over @xmath15 is the rms average of @xmath6 ( @xmath25 in eq .  ) . for gaussian flow fluctuations",
    "@xcite , the ratio of the rms to the mean is @xmath34 for @xmath1 and @xmath4 , and closer to 1 for @xmath0 and @xmath2 .    fig .",
    "[ fig : vn ] shows that our event - by - event ideal hydrodynamic calculation reproduces well the observed centrality and transverse momentum dependence of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath15 dependence is a generic feature of ideal hydrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "the magnitude and centrality dependence of @xmath6 , on the other hand , depend on the initial conditions : @xmath0 is mostly driven by the almond shape of the overlap area , which depends on the particular model used  @xcite , while higher harmonics are mostly driven by initial fluctuations  @xcite , which explains why they have a mild centrality dependence  @xcite .",
    "originally , quadrangular flow @xmath2 had been measured with respect to the event - plane of elliptic flow .",
    "recent results show that @xmath3  @xcite is smaller than @xmath14  @xcite , typically by a factor 2 for peripheral collisions , and by a factor 5 for central collisions .",
    "although @xmath3 is smaller , it is measured with a better relative accuracy than @xmath14 , because of the better resolution on @xmath16 .",
    "this makes @xmath3 a useful quantity for detailed model comparisons  @xcite . as in the case of @xmath18",
    ", we perform the average over events in two different ways in order to illustrate the effect of event - by - event flow fluctuations .",
    "the first estimate , labeled nexspherio- , is a plain mean value , as in eq .",
    "( [ defv42 ] ) .",
    "the second estimate , labeled nexspherio+ is a weigthed average : @xmath35 the actual event - plane value is expected to lie between these two limits , depending on the resolution  @xcite .    since @xmath3 can be generated by elliptic flow as a second order effect  @xcite , we scale it by @xmath36 for each @xmath15 .",
    "hereafter , we denote @xmath3 and @xmath37 simply by @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "[ fig : v4 ] displays this first event - by - event hydrodynamic calculation of @xmath38 as a function of @xmath15 for different centralities .",
    "the measured ratio is remarkably constant as a function of @xmath15 , and increases mildly for central collisions .",
    "ideal hydrodynamics predicts @xmath39 at high @xmath15 for a single event  @xcite .",
    "for all centralities , the measured value of @xmath38 is greater than @xmath40 , even at high @xmath15 .",
    "this can be explained  @xcite by @xmath0 fluctuations , except for the two most central bins , where one expects @xmath41",
    "@xcite , smaller than the measured value , which is between @xmath42 and @xmath43 for the most central bin .",
    "for these two central bins , our results from event - by - event hydrodynamics are in good agreement with experiment ( first two panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : v4 ] ) .",
    "this shows that other sources of flow fluctuations , other than @xmath0 fluctuations alone , contribute to @xmath38 . a similar",
    "finding has been reported in a transport calculation with @xmath2 and @xmath0 both defined with respect to the direction of the impact parameter  @xcite .",
    "our calculated @xmath38 is slightly higher than data for the next two bins ( @xmath44 ) . above @xmath45 centrality , data are within the range spanned by our calculations .",
    "the calculations shown here simulate the system evolution using ideal hydrodynamics , i.e. , with negligible viscosity .",
    "these results prove that no non - zero qgp viscosity is required to reproduce these data .",
    "in fact , this calculation _ requires _ a negligible viscosity  keeping everything else fixed , a viscosity the size of the conjectured bound @xmath46 would suppress @xmath6 and destroy the remarkable fit to data .",
    "in addition , the ratio @xmath47 depends strongly on @xmath9 , and any non - zero value usually tends to destroy the flat curve that ideal hydrodynamics predicts  @xcite .",
    "however , this requirement of negligible viscosity depends crucially on aspects of the model which are not entirely constrained . in particular , although the nexus model provides an honest effort at a reasonable description of the physics , with many realistic elements , there is considerable uncertainty about the early stages of a heavy - ion collision and the resulting initial conditions for hydrodynamic evolution . in principle , another model , coupled to viscous hydrodynamics might well be able to fit these data . for example ref .",
    "@xcite presents event - by - event viscous hydrodynamic calculations with glauber initial conditions that require a value close to @xmath48 to give reasonable agreement with the quantities in fig .",
    "[ fig : vn ] at several centralities , though they underpredict @xmath1 for central collisions . secondly , although @xmath38 is not very sensitive to the initial conditions , the effect of non - zero viscosity depends significantly on the way it is implemented at freeze out  @xcite , and the correct implementation is an open issue .",
    "thus , this work is only a first step in identifying models that are compatible with data , and strong conclusions can not yet be drawn about , e.g. , the precise value of @xmath9 .",
    "although the success of these calculations are an important milestone , proving that at this point no lower bound can yet be placed on @xmath9 , we can not yet make a precise statement about an upper bound  only that it still appears unlikely that a value significantly larger than @xmath49 will be possible .",
    "using an ideal hydrodynamic model with fluctuating initial conditions , we have performed the first simultaneous calculation of @xmath37 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath3 as a function of transverse momentum and centrality .",
    "our results are in good agreement with the most recent experimental results for all the observables at rhic , at all centralities and in a wide range of transverse momentum .",
    "this provides convincing confirmation of the current paradigm that collective effects alone can explain all long - range correlations in the soft sector .",
    "further , since all such measured correlations are generated consistently in a single calculation , this provides a complete , unified picture of the bulk evolution of a heavy - ion collision as an extremely low - viscosity fluid .",
    "indeed , for our model of initial conditions , a negligible viscosity is required for a good fit to all mid - rapidity flow observables .",
    "therefore no lower bound can currently be placed on the shear viscosity of the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "further study will be needed to determine a reliable upper bound , but finding models ( such as this one ) that are compatible with all measured data is a significant first step .",
