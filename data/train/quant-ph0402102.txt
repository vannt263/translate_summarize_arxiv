    "it would be highly desirable to implement quantum protocols using processors perfectly isolated from the environment , since this is one of the main sources of error in quantum computation ( there are also system specific imperfections , but here we will only address the environmental problem ) .",
    "unfortunately , this is not possible .",
    "quantum hardware will naturally become entangled with the environment during its operation .",
    "thus , if any hope of profiting from the benefits of quantum computation is to be kept , understanding and controlling quantum noise effects is essential . on the other hand ,",
    "the study of open systems is of interest in several fields , from both theoretical and experimental points of view @xcite .",
    "factoring large integers in polynomial time has been the milestone discovery that set out quantum computation as a major research topic @xcite . nevertheless , in the short term , few qubits quantum computers , this kind of calculations will be necessarily out of reach , since they involve large systems .",
    "then , it is reasonable to focus on understanding the behavior of accessible first realizations .",
    "it is interesting to remark that , with a few tens of qubits , quantum simulations of systems studied in quantum chaos ( like the quantum baker s map @xcite , the quantum kicked rotator @xcite , and the quantum sawtooth map @xcite ) would outperform any calculation that can be done with present day supercomputers . a first step in the simulation of quantum chaos models",
    "has been the implementation of the quantum baker s map on a three - qubit nmr - based quantum processor @xcite .    with this situation in mind , it is natural to ask to what extent we can know and control the operability and the stability of a quantum computer of this size .",
    "theoretical studies rely on evaluating the reduced density matrix of the system ( obtained after tracing out the environment ) , often in terms of various different approximations",
    ". it would therefore be desirable to give an answer for generic quantum protocols and noise models , using exact calculations . in this work , we propose the numerical simulation of superoperators as a way to do it . by means of quantum trajectories techniques",
    "we can reach results for system sizes for which the implementation of chaotic maps becomes relevant for theoretical studies in the field of quantum chaos , having the chance to include any kind of environmental effects .    instead of solving the density matrix directly , quantum trajectories stochastically evolve the state vector of the system , and after averaging over many runs the same results for the outcomes of any observable are obtained .",
    "the use of quantum trajectories in the field of quantum information has been pioneered by @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we applied this formalism to study the effect of a dissipative environment on the quantum teleportation protocol @xcite through a large chain of qubits .",
    "this situation models the transmission of quantum information through a chaotic quantum channel .",
    "here we review this model and present new results for different noise channels .",
    "as mentioned before , one of the main near future applications of quantum computation is the simulation of dynamical systems that are of great interest in quantum chaos . in this work we focus on the quantum baker s map , one of the most important examples of this kind of systems .",
    "this map is fully chaotic and its quantized version consists of conveniently selected quantum fourier transforms .",
    "we model the environment through a phase flip channel and study the fidelity of quantum computing of the quantum baker s map in this noisy environment .",
    "we note that the fidelity has already been computed experimentally with a three - qubit nmr quantum processor @xcite .",
    "hence , for the design and construction of quantum hardware with a larger number of qubits , simulations like those performed in this paper will become essential .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : qt ] , we present a brief explanation of the theory of quantum trajectories and connect it with the quantum operations approach to the density matrix evolution .",

    "[ sec : conclusion ] , we present our conclusions and outlook .",
    "there is a close relationship among the master equation in lindblad form , the superoperator formalism and the quantum trajectories theory .",
    "it is useful to review this relationship and to motivate the use of the quantum trajectory approach when studying open systems like quantum processors .",
    "we start with the special case of the master equation formulation of the problem and relate it with simulations using quantum trajectories techniques .",
    "then , in sec",
    ".  [ sec : qt : qops ] we generalize this establishing the connection with the broader quantum operators formalism .",
    "real systems interact with the environment , and , as mentioned before , these interactions are usually referred to as _ quantum noise _ @xcite .",
    "several models account for different sorts of system - environment interactions , the particular choice depending on the nature of the system and environment under consideration .",
    "such open quantum systems in general can not be described by a pure state , but rather by a mixed state .",
    "their evolution takes density matrices to density matrices .",
    "this allows the evolution from system s pure states to mixed ones , and also , in some noise models , from mixed to pure states . in order to obtain the differential equation corresponding to this process , one assumes markovian behavior , giving the evolution of the density operator with reference only to its state at present .",
    "this markovian assumption neglects memory effects : it implies that the time needed for the environment to loose the information it received from the system is short enough in comparison with the time scale of the dynamics we perceive .",
    "then , we are entitled to regard the information flow in only one direction , neglecting any kind of feedback @xcite",

    "there are no jumps and the system evolves according to the effective hamiltonian @xmath11 ( normalization is included also in this case because the evolution is given by a non - unitary operator ) .",
    "the numerical method we are going to use in order to simulate the master equation is usually known as the monte carlo wave function approach @xcite .",
    "we start from a pure state @xmath21 and at intervals @xmath13 , smaller than the timescales relevant for the evolution of the density matrix , we perform the following evaluation . we choose a random number @xmath22 from a uniform distribution in the unit interval @xmath23 $ ] .",

    "we repeat this process as many times as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the whole elapsed time during the evolution . note that we must take @xmath13 much smaller than the time scales relevant for the evolution of the open quantum system under investigation . in our simulations",
    ", @xmath34 will be proportional to the number of quantum gates involved in the corresponding protocol .",
    "each realization provides a different _ quantum trajectory _ and a particular set of them ( given a choice of the lindblad operators ) is an `` unraveling '' of the master equation .",
    "it is easy to see that if we average over different runs we recover the probabilities obtained with the density operator .",
    "in fact , given an operator @xmath35 , we can write the mean value @xmath36 $ ] as the average over @xmath37 trajectories : @xmath38 ( @xmath39 is the dimension of the hilbert space , @xmath40 being the number of qubits ) rather than a @xmath41 density matrix . moreover , there is also an advantage in computation time with respect to density matrix direct calculations .",
    "we find that a reasonable amount of trajectories ( we have used @xmath42 in all calculations , unless otherwise mentioned ) is needed in order to obtain a satisfactory statistical convergence .",
    "this picture can be formalized by means of the stochastic schrdinger equation @xcite @xmath43 this is a stochastic nonlinear differential equation , where the stochasticity is due to the measurement results : we think that the environment is actually measured ( as it is the case in indirect measurement models ) or simpler , that the contact of the system with the environment produces an effect similar to a continuous measurement @xcite .",
    "the nonlinearity is due to the renormalization of the state vector .",
    "the stochastic differential variables @xmath44 are statistically independent and represent measurement outcomes .",
    "their ensemble mean is given by @xmath45=\\langle l_{\\mu}^{\\dag } l_{\\mu } \\rangle_{\\phi } dt$ ] .",
    "the probability that the variable @xmath46 is equal to @xmath47 during a given time step @xmath13 is @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , most of the time the variables @xmath44 are @xmath49 and as a consequence the system evolves continuously by means of the non hermitian effective hamiltonian .",
    "however , when a variable @xmath44 is equal to @xmath47 , the corresponding term in equation ( [ stocsch ] ) is the most significant . in these cases",
    "the quantum jump occurs .",
    "note that there are also other possibilities in order to unravel the master equation such as the quantum state diffusion @xcite , for example .",
    "there is a close connection between the master equation in lindblad form and the quantum operations theory @xcite and we use this latter formalism as a comparison tool for the quantum trajectories calculations .",
    "furthermore , it will become clear that the evolution of the density matrix of the system given by this method can be put on the same footing as the stochastic evolution model .",
    "in fact , the latter constitutes a monte carlo simulation of the former .",
    "we write the solution to eq .",

    "it can be shown that , if the global evolution ( system plus environment ) is unitary , the kraus operators satisfy the completeness relation @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "note that the superoperator @xmath56 maps density matrices to density matrices , that is @xmath59 is hermitian , has unit trace and is nonnegative if @xmath60 satisfies these properties .",

    "equivalently , the set @xmath64 defines a positive operator valued measurement ( povm ) with operators @xmath65 , that satisfy @xmath66 .",
    "the outlined process is equivalent to performing a continuous measurement on the system ( or an indirect measurement if the environment is actually measured ) and shows the close connection between the kraus operators formalism and the quantum jumps picture .",
    "we would like to mention that the quantum operations formalism is more general than the master equation approach .",
    "the operator sum formulation in differential form can be obtained from the master equation , but a general quantum process described in terms of an operator sum representation needs to be markovian in order to be tractable with a master equation .",
    "this opens the possibility of studying a wide range of non markovian phenomena using quantum trajectories simulations .",
    "there are several ways to model the interaction of a system with the environment .",
    "the most common examples found in the literature are the amplitude damping channel , the phase flip channel , and the depolarizing channel @xcite . in this section",
    ", we give a brief description of two relevant noise models ( amplitude damping and phase damping ) in the single qubit case , and then we generalize them to @xmath40-qubit systems .",
    "dissipation ( energy loss ) is one of the main features present in open quantum systems .",
    "different phenomena like , for example , spontaneous atomic emission of a photon or spin systems approaching equilibrium can be modeled by this quantum operation , i.e. , the amplitude damping . considering the environment initially in the vacuum state @xmath67 , there is a probability @xmath68 that the excited state of the system decays and that the state of the environment changes from the vacuum to @xmath69 .",

    "tracing out the environment the corresponding kraus operators are obtained : @xmath75 the operator @xmath76 is responsible for the quantum jumps and @xmath77 for the continuous evolution . for the case of infinitesimal evolution operators ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : qt ] ) , a repeated application of this noise channel gives an exponential decay law of the population of the state @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "therefore , this evolution drives any intial ( pure or mixed ) state of the qubit to the pure state @xmath79 .",
    "note that here and in the following the matrix representations of the single - qubit kraus operators are written in the @xmath80 basis .",
    "we also consider the phase flip channel ( which is equivalent to the phase damping channel @xcite ) given by the following model @xmath81 this kind of noise can be thought as describing quantum information loss , in contrast with the previous model , which describes energy loss .",
    "this is a purely quantum mechanical process and has been extensively studied in the context of quantum to classical correspondence @xcite .    in order to generalize the single qubit amplitude damping process to many qubits",
    "we will follow two different points of view . in the first case",
    "we assume that a single damping probability describes the action of the environment , irrespective of the internal many - body state of the system . in the second approach",
    ", we assume that each qubit has its own interaction with the environment , independently of the other qubits .",
    "this makes the damping probability grow with the number of qubits that can perform the transition @xmath82 .",

    ", we have a probability @xmath68 for the system to perform one of the possible transitions , each of them being equally likely .",
    "this can be illustrated with a two - qubit example : @xmath83    a @xmath40-qubit state @xmath84 ( @xmath85 , with @xmath86 ) decays in the interval @xmath13 with a probability @xmath87 . after this infinitesimal time , the possible states of the system are those in which the damping @xmath88 has occurred in one of the qubits , the damping probability being the same for all the qubits .",
