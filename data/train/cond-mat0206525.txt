    "sandpile models were introduced some fifteen years ago as examples of self - organized criticality ( soc ) , or scale - invariance in the apparent absence of control parameters @xcite .",
    "subsequently the appearance of such  spontaneous \" criticality was shown to result from a control mechanism that forces the system to a critical point marking a phase transition to an absorbing state @xcite .",
    "in fact , sandpiles with the same local dynamics as the original  self - organized \" versions , but with strictly conserved particle density , @xmath1 , exhibit an absorbing - state phase transition as @xmath1 is varied . thus the particle density is the temperature - like control parameter for these models .    sandpiles with strictly conserved particle density ( so - called _ fixed - energy sandpiles _ or fes @xcite ) , exhibit absorbing - state phase transitions @xcite , which have attracted much interest of late , in connection with epidemics @xcite , catalysis @xcite , and the transition to turbulence @xcite . while continuous phase transitions to an absorbing state fall generically in the universality class of directed percolation ( dp ) @xcite",
    ", numerical evidence indicates that this is not so for sandpiles @xcite .",
    "the non - dp nature of the transition has been attributed to the coupling of the order parameter ( the density of active sites ) , to a second , conserved field ( the local particle density ) , which relaxes diffusively in the presence of activity , and remains frozen in its absence @xcite .",
    "independent of the connection with soc , fixed - energy sandpiles furnish intriguing examples of phase transitions far from equilibrium , incorporating cooperative relaxation in the form of activated diffusion . until now ,",
    "all quantitative results for fes have been numerical , based either on simulations @xcite , or on coherent - anomaly analysis of a series of @xmath2-site cluster approximations @xcite .",
    "phenomenological field theories for sandpiles have been proposed @xcite , but their analysis is far from straightforward .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to develop theoretical approaches for fes .",
    "this paper is the first of a series analyzing a stochastic sandpile using operator and path - integral methods . in this work",
    "we establish the path - integral representation , and use it to develop a time - dependent perturbation theory that yields an expansion for the activity density in powers of time . in subsequent work",
    "the series will be extended and analyzed .",
    "our analysis uses two principal tools .",
    "the first is an operator formalism for markov processes , of the kind developed by doi @xcite , and applied to various models exhibiting nonequilibrium phase transitions @xcite .",
    "the second is an exact mapping , due to peliti , from the markov process to a path - integral representation @xcite .",
    "this approach is often used to generate an effective action , which may then be analyzed using renormalization group ( rg ) techniques @xcite . in the present instance",
    ", however , we use the formalism not as the basis for an rg analysis , but to generate a series expansion for the order parameter .",
    "the expansion variable is the time ; the coefficients are polynomials in the particle density , @xmath1 .",

    "ii we define the model and the master equation governing its dynamics using an operator formalism , which is then mapped to the path - integral representation . sec .",
    "iii develops the perturbative expansion of the activity density in powers of time . in sec .",

    "toppling_. when a site topples , it loses exactly two particles (  grains of sand \" ) , which move randomly and independently to nearest - neighbor ( nn ) sites . in this work ,",
    "we adopt a toppling rate of @xmath5 for a site having @xmath2 particles .",
    "this choice of rate represents a slight departure from the examples studied previously , in which all active sites have the same toppling rate .",
    "the present rate leads to a much simpler evolution operator , and , on the other hand , should yield the same scaling properties , since sandpiles , like critical phenomena in general , exhibit a high degree of universality .",
    "( close to the critical point , the density of sites with @xmath6 particles is quite low , so that in practical terms our choice of rate should not alter quantitative properties greatly . since studies of _ restricted - height _ sandpiles @xcite reveal that they belong to the same universality class as their unrestricted counterparts , there is good reason to expect that a small change in transition rates , that does not modify the symmetry or conservation laws of the model , will have no effect on critical exponents . )",
    "preliminary simulation results @xcite indicate that the model studied here exhibits a continuous phase transition at @xmath7 , in one dimension ; the corresponding value for the model with the same toppling rate for all active sites is @xmath8 @xcite .    for simplicity",

    "two theoretical curves derived using the series , eq .",

    "the upper one is generated by transforming the time series to the variable @xmath248/b$ ] , and then constructing the [ 3,2 ] pad approximant to the @xmath249-series .",
    "for @xmath250 in the range 0.25 to 0.4 we find good agreement at short times ; for @xmath251 ( shown here ) there is excellent agreement for @xmath252 , but the theoretical prediction attains a constant , nonzero value thereafter .",
    "since @xmath238 must decay to zero in this case , it is interesting to study the series for @xmath253 .",
    "the latter remains negative for large @xmath50 , so that the activity itself decays to zero .",
    "the lower curve in fig .",
    "6 is obtained by transforming the derivative - log series to the variable @xmath254 ( with @xmath255 ) , and forming the [ 2,2 ] approximant to the @xmath256-series , which is then used to evaluate @xmath257 via numerical integration .",
    "the activity does indeed decay to zero , but too rapidly .",
    "we obtain very similar results using @xmath250 in the range of 2 to 3 , and using other transformations , for example @xmath249 given above , or a modified @xmath256 with the exponent 1/2 in place of 1/3 . after examining various further transformations and analyses ,",
    "we conclude that the present series is simply too short to yield useful predictions for long times .",
    "it should be noted that the apparent radius of convergence of the original series ( estimated from ratios of successive coefficients ) , is about @xmath258 for @xmath259 ; evidently , the transformation and approximant analysis greatly extends the utility of the series .",
    "( for @xmath260 , the radius of convergence is about @xmath261 ; the transformed series agrees well with simulations for @xmath262 . ) thus , despite the divergence between simulation and theory for times greater than about 10 , we regard the present comparison , based as it is on a very short series , as confirming the validity of our analysis . since the approach to the stationary state is neither exponential nor power - law , we anticipate that a fair number of terms will be required to represent it .",
    "once extended series are available , transformations that are consistent with the asymptotic behavior should yield good numerical estimates .",
    "we have derived an exact path - integral representation for the dynamics of a stochastic sandpile model similar to manna s sandpile , in a version with strictly conserved particle number .",
    "( the key differences are : ( 1 ) we analyze a continuous - time process , whereas manna s model is defined in discrete time ; and , ( 2 ) the toppling rate for a site with @xmath2 particles is @xmath5 rather than uniform , for all sites with @xmath4 . )",
    "we have argued that such minor differences should not affect scaling properties .",
    "the path - integral mapping yields an effective action that is nominally massless and parameter - free , the relevant parameter @xmath1 ( the particle density ) , appearing in the initial distribution not the evolution operator .",
    "this conclusion applies generally to non - dissipative sandpiles .",
    "in contrast to phenomenological field theories of sandpiles @xcite , in which the order parameter density is coupled to a second slowly relaxing variable ( the particle density ) , the exact action derived in the present work involves but a single field , @xmath64 , whose expectation is the particle density .",
    "the order parameter is given by @xmath77 .",
    "the derivation of a phenomenological description along the lines of refs . @xcite and @xcite , starting from the exact action , remains an open question .",
    "we develop a diagrammatic perturbation theory , leading to an expansion for the activity density in powers of time , where the coefficients are polynomials in @xmath1 .",
    "we point out certain general properties of the expansion : its limiting forms for very small , and very large @xmath1 , and the slow , diffusion - like nature of the relaxation .",
    "the series provides an important check on other theoretical methods , and on simulation results .",
    "while it appears to have a limited radius of convergence , experience with similar series , for the contact process @xcite and for random sequential adsorption @xcite , indicates that under suitable transformation of variables and pad approximant analysis , useful predictions can be obtained .",
    "we present some preliminary numerical evidence for this assertion .",
