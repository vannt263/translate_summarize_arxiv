    "a key aspect of measuring total star formation rates is to assess how a galaxy s spectral energy distribution is modulated by the effects of interstellar dust .",
    "the ability to quantify dust attenuation at high redshift is hindered by the limited dynamic range in luminosity at wavelengths that are sensitive to dust emission .",
    "while the lyman break technique @xcite has proven to be the most effective method of identifying galaxies across a large dynamic range in luminosity and lookback time , it requires observations in the rest - frame uv : the massive stars giving rise to the uv continuum also produce much of the dust that attenuates this continuum .",
    "the diminution of uv light is compounded by the fact that much of this radiation is re - emitted in the far - infrared where current instrumental sensitivity is insufficient to directly detect typical star - forming galaxies at @xmath19 .",
    "it has therefore become common to use local relations between monochromatic and bolometric luminosity to infer the star formation rates and dust attenuation of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "prior to the era of large - scale multi - wavelength surveys like goods @xcite , inferring the dust attenuation at high redshift commonly entailed using relations between the variation of the uv continuum slope with dustiness as found for local starburst galaxies @xcite . however , such correlations were previously untested at high redshift .",
    "the correlation between the redness of the uv slope ( @xmath24 ) and dust attenuation has limited applicability when examined over a larger range in galaxy stellar population and luminosity .",
    "galaxies with older and less massive stars contributing significantly to the uv emission can also exhibit a redder spectral slope @xcite .",
    "further , the uv slope decouples from extinction for very luminous galaxies where virtually all of the star formation is obscured , such as is the case for low redshift ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ; @xcite ) .",
    "nonetheless , the local trend between uv slope and dustiness is still applied widely to galaxies at high redshift ; this correlation is often the only means by which one can infer the dust attenuation of galaxies at @xmath28 , where the dust emission from a typical galaxy may be several orders of magnitude below the sensitivity limits of current infrared instruments .",
    "incremental progress in determining dust attenuation at high redshift was achieved with the first ultra - deep radio and x - ray surveys ( e.g. , @xcite ) . though the sensitivity ( even at goods - depth ) at these wavelengths was insufficient to individually detect typical star - forming galaxies at @xmath19",
    ", these surveys did allow for estimates of the mean dust attenuation based on stacking analyses .",
    "initial studies suggested a general agreement between uv and radio / x - ray inferences of dust attenuation at @xmath29 @xcite .",

    "s mips @xmath7@xmath2 m band is sensitive to the strongest dust emission feature ( at @xmath30@xmath2 m ) in star - forming galaxies .",
    "this feature arises from the stochastic uv photo - heating of small dust grains and hydrocarbons ( e.g. , @xcite ) and is found to correlate with the uv radiation from ob stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , albeit with significant scatter ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "several studies have demonstrated that the dust attenuation inferred from the uv spectral slope , @xmath24 , for typical @xmath11 galaxies is in general agreement with that inferred from mips @xmath7@xmath2 m ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "regardless , local studies of resolved galaxies have emphasized the complexity of the @xmath13@xmath2 m emission and the need to combine it with other obscured ( ir ) and unobscured ( uv , h@xmath23 ) tracers of star formation in order to obtain the most reliable measure of the bolometric luminosity @xcite .    to this end , we take advantage of the improved sensitivity of _ herschel_/pacs at @xmath0 and @xmath1@xmath2 m @xcite to measure directly for the first time the thermal dust emission from a large sample of typical ( @xmath4 ) star - forming galaxies at @xmath11 .",
    "we make use of the deep pacs data made possible by the goods-_herschel _ open time key project ( pi : d. elbaz ) .",
    "we supplement these data with deep very large array ( vla ) @xmath8ghz continuum imaging in the goods - north field @xcite .",
    "the primary aim is to constrain the average infrared luminosities of galaxies at high redshift , particularly those selected by their rest - frame uv colors , and to compare them to uv - based inferences .",
    "we begin in section  [ sec : sample ] by discussing the uv - selected galaxies and previous efforts to measure their stellar populations and dust attenuation .",
    "we also provide a brief description of the _ herschel _ and radio data .",
    "our stacking method and stacking simulations are described in section  [ sec : stacking ] , followed by a discussion of the dust spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fits to the stacked fluxes and the total infrared luminosities in section  [ sec : luminosities ] . in section  [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we proceed to compare the _",
    "herschel_-based inferences of the dust attenuation with that inferred from the uv slope and discuss systematics in the dust obscuration with stellar population age and bolometric and uv luminosity . for ease of comparison with other studies , we assume a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) and adopt a cosmology with @xmath31kms@xmath32mpc@xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "the goods - north field was targeted as part of an ongoing imaging and spectroscopic survey of uv - selected galaxies at @xmath29 @xcite , primarily to take advantage of the extensive multi - wavelength data that exist for this field .",
    "spectroscopic catalogs and analysis of the goods - north sample , including the stellar masses and dust attenuation of @xmath4 galaxies at @xmath29 , are presented in @xcite .",
    "briefly , the galaxies were selected to lie at redshifts @xmath35 based on the `` bm , '' `` bx , '' and lyman break galaxy ( lbg ) color criteria @xcite .",
    "extensive spectroscopic followup of candidates brighter than @xmath36 was conducted using the blue arm of the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ; @xcite ) on the keck i telescope .",
    "the criteria used to construct our sample are identical to those of @xcite .",
    "only galaxies with secure spectroscopic redshifts @xmath37 were considered as this is the redshift range over which the mips band is sensitive to rest - frame @xmath13@xmath2 m emission .",
    "galaxies with any agn signatures based on optical emission lines ( ly@xmath23 , civ , nv ) or a power - law sed through the irac and mips @xmath7@xmath2 m bands were excluded .",
    "additionally , galaxies were included only if we were able to obtain robust point spread function ( psf ) fits to their @xmath7@xmath2 m emission ; in practice , this meant that a few galaxies were rejected because they are confused with nearby neighbors ( see @xcite for the parameter used to measure the degeneracy of the psf fits ) .",
    "this sample forms the basis of our stacking analysis , and includes a total of 146 galaxies , approximately @xmath38 of which are detected with greater than @xmath39@xmath40 significance in the goods - n @xmath7@xmath2 m data .",
    "@xcite use a larger spectroscopic and photometric sample ( the latter extending to @xmath41 ) in 31 independent fields to quantify the selection function for the uv sample and determine the uv luminosity function at @xmath11 .",
    "this analysis indicates that uv - selected galaxies commonly targeted for spectroscopy with @xmath42 have luminosities similar to @xmath4 of the uv luminosity function , where @xmath43l@xmath10 @xcite . throughout the text",
    ", @xmath4 refers to the characteristic luminosity of the uv luminosity function , unless stated otherwise .",
    "the stellar populations of these galaxies have been modeled previously , and we refer the reader to @xcite for a detailed description of the modeling procedure .    briefly , charlot & bruzual ( in prep . ) stellar population models with a range of exponentially - declining star formation histories @xmath44 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 , 200 , 500 , 1000 , 2000 , and 5000myr , as well as a constant star formation history , were fit to the observed @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and _",
    "spitzer_/irac data .",
    "in addition , we considered ages spaced roughly logarithmically between 70 and 5000myr , excluding any that are older than the age of the universe at the redshift of each galaxy .",
    "the lower limit to the allowed ages ( @xmath47myr ) was adopted to reflect the typical dynamical time - scale as inferred from velocity dispersion and size measurements of @xmath11 lbgs @xcite .",
    "reddening was incorporated by employing the @xcite attenuation curve and allowing @xmath48 to range between 0.0 and 0.6 .",
    "we adopt the best - fit stellar population parameters obtained when assuming a constant star formation ( csf ) history , unless an exponentially declining ( @xmath49 ) model gives a significantly better fit to the broadband data .",
    "generally , the @xmath50 values assuming the csf model were similar to those obtained when @xmath49 is allowed to vary freely .",
    "further , more extreme star formation histories , where the ratio of the age to @xmath49 is much greater than unity , i.e. , @xmath51 , can be ruled out based on the presence of o star and wolf - rayet features in the composite uv spectra of @xmath11 galaxies , as well as the fact that such models often predict ages that are unrealistically much younger than the dynamical timescale at @xmath11 .",
    "for the present analysis , we use the results of the stellar population modeling to distinguish those galaxies that have young star formation ages @xmath52myr .",
    "such galaxies have been shown previously to depart from the uv attenuation curve established for more typical galaxies at @xmath11 @xcite , and we wish to explore this difference with the _ herschel _ data .      the sample of 146 uv - selected galaxies was subdivided into subsamples in order to investigate the differences in dust attenuation between galaxies with blue and red uv spectral slopes , those with high bolometric luminosities ( @xmath53 ) , and those with young stellar population ages .",
    "the properties of these subsamples , including the criteria used to construct them , the number of galaxies in each subsample , and their @xmath24 and redshift distributions , are summarized in table  [ tab : stacks ] .",
    "as noted above , the ages are estimated from stellar population modeling of the rest - frame uv through _ spitzer _ irac photometry .",
    "for the purpose of contructing the subsamples , we estimated bolometric luminosities based on the @xcite calibration between @xmath13@xmath2 m and infrared luminosity ( see next section ) . finally , uv slopes @xmath24 were determined from the @xmath54 colors of galaxies as follows .",
    "we generated power laws in @xmath55 for @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "these were attenuated for the ly@xmath23 forest opacity assuming the @xcite prescription and multiplied by the @xmath58 and @xmath59 transmission filters .",
    "the @xmath58 band is affected by the ly@xmath23 forest only for redshifts @xmath60 ; statistical fluctuations in the forest will not affect @xmath24 as most of the galaxies considered here lie below redshift @xmath61 .",
    "for this same reason , ly@xmath23 lies outside of the @xmath58-band filter and will therefore not affect @xmath24 . the uv slope for a given galaxy",

    "finally , we corrected the observed fluxes ( listed in table  [ tab : fluxes ] ) by the bias factors given in table  [ tab : biaserr ] before inferring the total infrared luminosities , as we discuss in the next section .",
    "we have performed several tests to validate our measures of the stacked fluxes for uv - selected galaxies .",
    "the method employed here is able to recover the stacked fluxes of galaxies with a bias of just a few percent relative to the known fluxes of artificial sources added to the 1.4ghz , and @xmath7 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1@xmath2 m images .",
    "these tests also imply a very low probability ( @xmath172 ) of accidentally recovering stacked fluxes that are as high as the target stacked fluxes . finally , we test for the effect of source clustering on the stacked flux at @xmath0@xmath2 m . by excluding galaxies from the stack which have any nearby sources",
    ", we find that the remaining galaxies have a median flux that is identical within the measurement errors of the median flux inferred for the entire sample of galaxies .",
    "this indicates that any sources that may cluster around the uv - selected galaxies ( if they exist ) do not affect the stacking results .",
    "to infer the total infrared luminosities @xmath173 of the @xmath11 galaxies , we employed several publicly available dust sed templates including those of @xcite ( `` ce01 '' ) , @xcite ( `` dh02 '' ) , and @xcite ( `` rieke+09 '' ) .",
    "we also include the median templates presented in @xcite .",
    "specifically , these authors define an `` infrared main sequence '' of galaxies , where the ratio of @xmath3 to @xmath14 ( ir8 ) is universal for most star - forming galaxies at @xmath174 , having a value of @xmath175 .",
    "the `` infrared starbursts '' are considered to be those galaxies with ir8 ratios in excess of @xmath176 .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that variations in ir8 may be due primarily to differences in the infrared luminosity surface density of galaxies , such that main sequence galaxies are characterized by star formation that is more extended than that present in starbursts ( see section  [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "we fit the median ir sed of these main sequence ( `` elbaz+11-ms '' ) and starburst galaxies ( `` elbaz+11-sb '' ) to the stacked fluxes .    the @xcite calibration between rest - frame @xmath13@xmath2 m emission and infrared luminosity is considered as well . in this case",
    ", @xmath14 is computed by k - correcting the @xmath7@xmath2 m flux using the average of 12 local galaxy mid - ir seds specified in @xcite . the correlation between @xmath14 and h@xmath23 luminosity",
    "is then used to infer the @xmath14@xmath3 conversion , based on using h@xmath23 as an independent probe of the star formation @xcite .",
    "finally , we make use of the radio - infrared correlation to provide an independent estimate of @xmath3 , assuming that this relation does not evolve with redshift , as is consistent with the evidence , at least at redshifts @xmath177 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for the subsequent analysis",
    ", we use the radio - infrared correlation published in @xcite .",
    "the sample of @xcite is roughly a factor of 10 larger than the one analyzed by @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite calibrate the @xmath178@xmath2 m luminosity , @xmath179 , with radio luminosity , and the former requires some assumption about the relation between @xmath179 and @xmath3 . to make the minimum number of assumptions",
    ", we therefore adopted the @xcite calibration which directly relates the total infrared luminosities to the specific luminosity at @xmath8ghz .",
    "the ce01 and rieke+09 models are parameterized such that we can relate any template to a given total infrared luminosity .",
    "the elbaz+11-ms / sb templates are normalized to an infrared luminosity of @xmath180l@xmath10 .",
    "the dh02 models are presented as a function of radiation field intensity and , following the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we associate infrared luminosities with each of the dh02 templates assuming the empirical calibration of @xcite .",
    "the ce01 and rieke+09 models also include an extrapolation to radio wavelengths by assuming some version of the local radio - far - infrared correlation @xcite . for a consistent treatment",

    "we have adopted both methods for comparison purposes .",
    "the elbaz+11-ms / sb templates are based on the composite ir spectral energy distribution of the `` main sequence '' and `` starburst '' galaxy samples of @xcite , and are normalized to @xmath180l@xmath10 .",
    "we assume the same spectral shape ( i.e. , no color dependence ) when fitting these templates to the observed fluxes .",
    "further , in finding the best - fit template , we include results where all fluxes have been weighted equally , as well as being weighted by their errors .",
    "the equal weighting is done to ensure that the higher s / n @xmath7@xmath2 m data ( and thus the smaller measurement uncertainties at @xmath7@xmath2 m ) do not unduly skew the template fits .",
    "table  [ tab : lircomp ] lists the @xmath3 corresponding to the best - fit templates for different combinations of the stacked fluxes for samples a through f , after taking into account the biases and dispersions in these fluxes ( see discussion above and table  [ tab : biaserr ] ) .",
    "fitting for different combinations of the infrared and radio data allows us to determine if the inclusion of any of the stacked fluxes results in significant changes in the inferred infrared luminosities .",
    "also included in this table are the results from using the @xcite calibration between @xmath14 and @xmath3 , and the @xmath3 corresponding radio luminosity assuming the @xcite radio - ir correlation .",

    "fortunately , the _ herschel _ pacs sensivity and resolution are such that we can for the first time significantly detect the average thermal emission of non - lensed @xmath4 galaxies at @xmath11 .      the stacks for the different subsamples indicate that galaxies with bluer uv spectral slopes are on average less infrared luminous than those with red uv spectral slopes ( table  [ tab : lircomp ] ) .",

    "these values imply that the galaxies in our sample predominantly lie on the boundary between the ratios found for infrared main sequence galaxies ( ir8@xmath362 ) , and those found for starburst galaxies which have an exponential tail distribution extending to ir8@xmath363 .",
    "the relatively high ir8 ratios also may explain why the typically - adopted templates ( e.g. , ce01 ) tend to not fail as badly for galaxies in our sample relative to more luminous ulirgs at @xmath11 when inferring @xmath3 from @xmath14 alone ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a detailed comparison between the morphologies of the @xmath11 galaxies studied here and local star - forming galaxies is beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "the relevance for the present discussion is that while @xmath4 galaxies at @xmath373 appear to have ir8 ratios that are a factor of @xmath374 larger than for main sequence galaxies at lower redshifts , they also exhibit @xmath375 that are larger than those found for main sequence galaxies , and hence are more compact for their ir luminosity .",
    "formally , galaxies in our sample would lie on the `` boundary '' between ir main sequence and ir starburst galaxies .",
    "these larger ir8 ratios result in the over - prediction of @xmath3 based on @xmath14 alone when using the standard templates , as noted in section  [ sec : luminosities ] .",
    "one possibility is that the ir8 ratio for typical star - forming ( @xmath4 ) galaxies may evolve with redshift , transitioning from ir8@xmath376 at @xmath343 to ir8@xmath377 at @xmath373 .",
    "this effect is likely due to the smaller sizes of high redshift galaxies for their ir luminosities relative to lower redshift galaxies .",

    "observations , which probe the thermal dust emission at @xmath11 , are consistent with these findings based on @xmath7@xmath2 m emission alone .",
    "if the difference in attenuation curve is due purely to geometrical effects , then it suggests that the dust covering fraction of high - redshift galaxies evolves significantly with time .",
    "a possible simple scenario is one in which the first generation of stars quickly pollutes the ism with dust and metals over a dynamical timescale of a few tens of millions of years , at which point much of the dust is foreground to the stars and the dust covering fraction is high . as star formation proceeds and either becomes spatially extended or is able to drive outflows sufficient in momentum to perturb the dust / gas distribution of the ism , the resulting attenuation becomes patchier .",
    "so , we might expect in this situation that galaxies would gradually transition from a steep attenuation curve like that of the smc to a grayer starburst attenuation curve ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also discussion in @xcite ) .",

    "<S> we take advantage of the sensitivity and resolution of the _ herschel space observatory _ at @xmath0 and @xmath1@xmath2 m to directly image the thermal dust emission and investigate the infrared luminosities ( @xmath3 ) and dust obscuration of typical star - forming ( @xmath4 ) galaxies at high redshift . </S>",
    "<S> our sample consists of @xmath5 uv - selected galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts @xmath6 in the goods - north field . </S>",
    "<S> supplemented with deep very large array ( vla ) and _ spitzer _ imaging , we construct median stacks at the positions of these galaxies at @xmath7 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1@xmath2 m , and @xmath8ghz . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison between these stacked fluxes and a variety of dust templates and calibrations implies that typical star - forming galaxies with uv luminosities @xmath9l@xmath10 at @xmath11 are luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) with a median @xmath12l@xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> their median ratio of @xmath3 to rest - frame @xmath13@xmath2 m luminosity ( @xmath14 ) is @xmath15 and is @xmath16 larger than that found for most star - forming galaxies at @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> this apparent redshift evolution in the @xmath18 ratio may be tied to the trend of larger infrared luminosity surface density for @xmath19 galaxies relative to those at lower redshift . </S>",
    "<S> typical galaxies at @xmath20 have a median dust obscuration @xmath21 , which corresponds to a dust correction factor , required to recover the bolometric star formation rate ( sfr ) from the unobscured uv sfr , of @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> this result is similar to that inferred from previous investigations of the uv , h@xmath23 , @xmath7@xmath2 m , radio , and x - ray properties of the same galaxies studied here . stacking in bins of uv slope ( @xmath24 ) </S>",
    "<S> implies that @xmath4 galaxies with redder spectral slopes are also dustier , and that the correlation between @xmath24 and dustiness is similar to that found for local starburst galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> hence , </S>",
    "<S> the rest - frame @xmath25 and @xmath26@xmath2 m fluxes validate on average the use of the local uv attenuation curve to recover the dust attenuation of typical star - forming galaxies at high redshift . in the simplest interpretation , </S>",
    "<S> the agreement between the local and high redshift uv attenuation curves suggests a similarity in the dust production and stellar and dust geometries of starburst galaxies over the last @xmath27billion years . </S>"
