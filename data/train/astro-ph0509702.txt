    "one of the fundamental pursuits of deep x - ray surveys is the identification of the sources making up the observed x - ray background radiation @xcite . because the x - ray powerhouses of the universe are energetically accreting super - massive black holes , or active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , this issue",
    "is inherently linked to another important topic : an understanding of the cosmic history of super - massive black hole ( smbh ) accretion activity .",
    "x - ray surveys are arguably among the best methods for obtaining the least - biased samples of agns because x - rays are able to penetrate large column densities of gas and dust , and because dilution by host galaxy light at x - ray energies is believed to be minimal .    using sensitive instruments such as the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ @xcite ,",
    "astronomers have resolved @xmath1@xmath2 of the 0.52  kev background radiation into discrete sources .",
    "the dominant contributors to the background in this soft energy band have been identified via optical spectroscopy as type 1 seyfert galaxies and quasars , i.  e. , moderate - luminosity ( @xmath3@xmath4 ) agns recognized by their broad permitted emission lines in the optical @xcite .",
    "deep surveys reveal that the integral number counts of resolved sources at soft energies flatten at fluxes below @xmath1@xmath5 , confirming that most of the population has already been detected @xcite . above 8  kev , however , only @xmath1@xmath6 of the x - ray background has been resolved , and , in the 510 kev energy band , no turn - over in number counts is observed out to the flux limits of current x - ray surveys @xcite .",
    "this suggests that a substantial fraction of the hard x - ray background is coming from sources that are unrepresented at soft energies ; indeed , 1420% of the 28  kev sources are undetected in the 0.52  kev band in deep x - ray surveys @xcite .",
    "furthermore , while the integrated light from the 110  kev background can be fit with a power - law model of the form @xmath7 , with photon index @xmath8 @xcite , the combined spectrum of the resolved x - ray background components is much softer .",
    "@xcite measured an average 0.212  kev photon index of @xmath9 for the resolved x - ray sources , with the slope being steeper ( @xmath10 ) at hard energies and shallower ( @xmath11 ) at soft energies .",
    "they also found that the photon index is harder ( with a flatter spectral slope ) for the x - ray faint resolved sources than for the x - ray bright sources .",
    "all of this points to a population of as - yet undetected , faint , hard objects contributing significantly to the hard ( @xmath12  kev ) x - ray background .",
    "type 2 ( narrow optical emission line ) seyfert galaxies have emerged as the preferred candidates for this unresolved population . while the intrinsic luminosities of seyfert 2 nuclei can be comparable to seyfert 1 nuclei , their continuum emission from the optical to the soft x - rays is highly obscured",
    ". many of these objects are optically thick to compton scattering ( `` compton thick '' , @xmath13  @xmath14  1.5  @xmath15  10@xmath16  @xmath17 ) , and are therefore so heavily absorbed at soft x - ray energies that only reprocessed , indirect x - rays are observable , and the resulting spectra are hard , consistent with the expected properties of the unresolved background population . even objects with smaller column densities may be highly obscured ; for example , the observed 210  kev flux of a @xmath18 object with @xmath13 = 5 @xmath15 10@xmath19  @xmath17 would be only one - third of its unabsorbed flux . above @xmath2010  kev ,",
    "type 2 agns may appear much brighter than at soft energies because their higher energy emission is much less affected by obscuring gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , their contribution to the x - ray background above 10  kev can not be estimated with a simple extrapolation of their lower energy spectra .",
    "it is important to recognize the obscured agn character of these objects so that their emerging hard x - ray flux can be included in accounting for the x - ray background .",
    "as it turns out , x - ray observers have not been able to identify a sufficiently large population of seyfert 2 galaxies at high redshifts to explain the observed hard x - ray background . instead",
    ", deep surveys have revealed several new observational classes of x - ray sources , including optically bright , x - ray faint galaxies ( obxfs ) and x - ray bright , optically normal galaxies ( xbongs ) .",
    "neither obxfs nor xbongs would be classified as agns , based on their optical spectra .",
    "the obxfs are distinguished by their low x - ray  to  optical ( @xmath21-band ) flux ratios ( log@xmath22  @xmath23  @xmath24 ) @xcite and are typically found at relatively low redshifts ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "their low x - ray fluxes , combined with their quiescent optical spectra , suggest that they are `` normal '' galaxies .",
    "follow - up optical observations of some obxfs have confirmed their quiescent character @xcite .",
    "obxfs represent a significant fraction of the faintest x - ray  detected sources in deep surveys , and it remains to be seen whether some of these objects might also host agns .",
    "xbongs , on the other hand , have large agn luminosities ( @xmath26 ) in the hard ( 28  kev ) x - ray band @xcite .",
    "the x - ray brightness of these objects requires the presence of smbh accretion activity ( i.  e. , they must be agns ) , despite their quiescent optical spectra .",
    "there is an additional population of x - ray  detected objects with extremely faint optical counterparts that lack classification altogether",
    ". these may include low - luminosity and optically obscured agns .    to account for the apparent dearth of seyfert 2 galaxies in deep x - ray surveys ,",
    "some of the x - ray galaxies that are optically classified as `` normal , '' including the obxfs and xbongs , may contain agns that are going unrecognized because of the limited means of identifying the properties of distant objects from ground - based observatories .",
    "in particular , @xcite have suggested that the optical spectral characteristics of type 2 seyferts may be drowned out by host galaxy light because many seyfert 2 nuclei have low observable emission - line luminosities ( @xmath27 } } \\lesssim 10^{40}$ ] ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this is especially likely in observations of high redshift objects , for which it is impossible to spatially isolate the point - like nuclear light from the extended starlight regions of galaxies . in a sample of nearby seyfert 2",
    "galaxies , @xcite found that @xmath28 of the objects would have been wrongly optically classified as normal galaxies in deep field surveys based on their integrated spectra because starlight overwhelmed their agn emission in the optical band .",
    "this suggests that some of the galaxies detected in deep x - ray surveys could be mistakenly identified via optical spectroscopy as `` normal '' galaxies when , in fact , they harbor agns . if this is the case , then it is possible that part of the missing population of galaxies expected to make up the hard x - ray background is hiding among the apparently normal galaxies of deep surveys . in the case of xbongs ,",
    "their high x - ray luminosities almost certainly require smbh accretion activity .    as an x - ray analog to the study of @xcite , and to further investigate the possibility that high - redshift type 2 agns are being detected but misidentified in deep x - ray surveys , we have artificially redshifted a sample of _ chandra _  observations of well - studied , nearby , seyfert and starburst galaxies to redshift @xmath0 , corresponding to a look - back time of @xmath1@xmath29 gyr , an epoch where normal / starburst galaxy x - ray luminosity functions have already been assembled @xcite . in ",
    "2 we describe the sample selection , data analysis , and artificial redshifting procedures .",
    "section 3 presents the results of the artificial redshifting process . in   4 we compare the results to those of deep field surveys , and in   5",
    "we present our conclusions .",
    "the initial galaxy sample was selected from the public _ chandra _",
    "data archive , correlated with the @xcite catalog of quasars and active galaxies as of june 2003 , and filtered to select observations with the backside - illuminated s3 ccd of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in which a @xmath30   point source would have a @xmath31 7  count detection ( corresponding to exposure times of 63  s and 106  ks for objects with photon indices of @xmath8 at redshifts of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively ) .",
    "the s3  ccd is preferred because of its superior spectral resolution and enhanced response at energies below 1  kev .",
    "these initial selection criteria yielded a set of 29 objects , including one starburst galaxy ( ngc  2782 ) , which appears to have been wrongly included in the catalog of @xcite .",
    "most authors refer to ngc  2782 only as a starburst @xcite , and @xcite claim that there is no evidence of an agn in this galaxy .",
    "we classify it as a non - agn starburst .",
    "in the course of our analysis , eight sources , including five seyfert 1s , were eliminated for any of the following three reasons : having too few counts , having an angular size significantly exceeding that of the 8@xmath34 @xmath15 8@xmath34 s3 ccd , or showing evidence of severe data degradation by pile - up .",
    "pile - up occurs when two or more photons arrive on a pixel between ccd read - outs , causing loss of counts , and diminishing both the spatial and spectral qualities of observations ( see   2.2 ) .",
    "one starburst galaxy ( ngc 4736 ) and one luminous seyfert 1/starburst galaxy ( markarian 231 ) were added to the initial sample .",
    "our final sample consists of 23 galaxies with redshifts ranging from @xmath35 to 0.04 .",
    "a list of the objects , including the details of their observations , is provided in table  [ tab : gal_props ] .",
    "two of the galaxies are starbursts without agn activity , the other 21 are seyferts , six of which host starbursts .",
    "ten of the galaxies also have luminous x - ray point source populations .",
    "_ chandra _  acis data were retrieved from the _ chandra _  data archive and reprocessed from the level 1 event files using a scripted reduction pipeline to ensure uniform analysis of all the observations .",
    "this analysis employed the ciao  v.3.2 , heasoft  v.5.3.1 , and idl  v.6.0 software packages .",
    "the acis data were filtered to include only data from the s3 chip .",
    "the ciao tool acis_process_events was used to remove the positional randomization that is introduced by the standard pipeline to avoid aliasing effects in short exposures . to mitigate charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) , we employed the acis cti correction software package developed by @xcite .",
    "the data were filtered on `` good '' asca grades ( keeping grades 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 to optimize the signal - to - background ratio ) and on status . after examining each light curve for background flares , we accordingly adjusted and filtered on good time intervals to produce level 2 event files .    to avoid the adverse spatial and spectral effects of pile - up ( see   2.1 ) , we examined each image for read - out streaks and dark spots caused by pulse saturation , both of which are symptoms of pile - up .",
    "we also surveyed the literature for descriptions of _ chandra _  data analyses of each of these sources , looking for any mention of pile - up . for those galaxies with evidence of pile - up",
    ", we used the pimms v.3.2a acis pile up and background count estimation tool to determine whether the pile - up was significant enough to affect our analysis .",
    "when possible , we repaired the piled - up regions of galaxies using observations taken with shorter frame - times , which were therefore less prone to pile - up . otherwise , galaxies with estimated pile - up count rates in excess of @xmath36 were removed from the sample .      in order to move the galaxies in our sample to @xmath37",
    ", we accounted for both the spatial and spectral effects of increased redshift on the observations .",
    "we assumed no redshift evolution . throughout this paper",
    "we will use the terms `` original observations '' and `` original images '' to refer to the actual observations of the galaxies at their true , low redshifts .",
    "we will use `` redshifted galaxies '' and `` redshifted images '' to refer to the artificially redshifted observations produced by the analysis described below .",
    "we began by redshifting the energies of the detected photons , being mindful of the dependence of acis sensitivity on photon energy as described by the auxiliary response file ( arf ) associated with each _ chandra _  observation .",
    "the arf relates the expected detector count rate to the incident source spectrum , accounting for the effective area and quantum efficiency of the telescope , filter , and detector system . in general , the number of counts in a single _ chandra _  energy band , @xmath38 , is measured to be @xmath39 where a(e ) represents the arf and f(e ) the emission spectrum of the object . in redshifting each observation to @xmath37",
    ", we had to account for the fact that the redshifted emission spectrum from the source would encounter a non - redshifted arf at the detector .",
    "thus , to get the appropriate number of counts in the observed band @xmath38 for an artificially redshifted galaxy , we could not simply count the photons from the original observations in a blueshifted energy band , @xmath40 ; the arf also had to be effectively redshifted , i.  e. , @xmath41 in practice , we accomplished this by multiplying the image by the ratio @xmath42 because this ratio varies significantly over the range of energies to which _ chandra _  is sensitive , we divided the observations into narrow energy bands in which the arf ratio varied by less than @xmath43 , then we multiplied each narrow - band image by its corresponding ratio .",
    "this resulted in images in energy bands as narrow as 0.01  kev at very soft energies ( below  @xmath44  kev ) and bands as large as 1.85 kev at higher energies .",
    "the appropriate grating efficiency was included in creating arfs for the original gratings observations .",
    "after redshifting the energy in this way , we adjusted the angular extent of each narrow - band image to account for increased distance @xcite , using a @xmath45cdm cosmology with @xmath46  =  0.3 , @xmath47  =  0.7 and @xmath48  =  70  km  s@xmath49  mpc@xmath49 . because this re - sizing combined many original pixels into each redshifted pixel , the background level , which is usually negligible even for very long _ chandra _",
    "observations , was high and unrealistic in the redshifted images .",
    "we accounted for most of the background by measuring the average background level per pixel in the original images , multiplying this value by an appropriate re - sizing factor and arf ratio , and subtracting it from the redshifted images .",
    "the flux of each galaxy was decreased according to its increased distance , however this adjustment reduced the total detectable signal from most of the sources to @xmath50 10 counts . in order to have numbers of counts comparable to those of deep field surveys , we artificially increased the exposure time of each observation ( i.  e. , linearly increased the number of counts per pixel ) such that the brightest pixel in the 0.58 kev band image of each galaxy had 100 counts .",
    "( note : this did not change the luminosities of the objects since we kept track of the observation times .",
    "the total artificial exposure time for each redshifted image is listed in column 5 of table  [ tab : gal_props ] . )",
    "even after this increase , all of the objects appeared as unresolved point sources .",
    "we then randomized the number of counts in each pixel based on a poisson distribution and blurred each image by the energy - dependent , on - axis _",
    "chandra _",
    "point spread function ( psf ) to create a more realistic observation of a point source .",
    "the narrow - band images were added up to create a final set of redshifted images in the following three observed - frame energy bands : full ( 0.58 kev ) , soft ( 0.52 kev ) , and hard ( 28 kev ) . above 8.0 kev , the effective area of the chandra mirrors rapidly declines while the background flux increases , reducing the signal - to - noise ratio ; the lower limit of 0.5 kev was chosen to match the well - calibrated part of the instrument response function .",
    "the ciao tool wavdetect was used to locate the redshifted galaxy in each full - band image .",
    "aperture photometry centered at the corresponding locations was performed in the soft- and hard - band images , using apertures based on the @xmath51 encircled energy radius of the _ chandra _  psf @xcite .",
    "the remaining local background in each redshifted image was measured in a surrounding region and subtracted , and appropriate aperture corrections were applied . when a source was not detected in a given band",
    ", an upper limit was calculated using the bayesian method of @xcite , for @xmath2 confidence .",
    "hardness ratios were calculated from the hard- and soft - band counts as follows : + @xmath52  =  @xmath53 .",
    "the hard- and soft - band fluxes and luminosities of each redshifted galaxy were estimated based on a spectral model of the form @xmath54 photon @xmath17 s@xmath49  kev@xmath49 , where the photon index , @xmath55 , was determined from the measured hardness ratio ( @xmath56 corresponds to @xmath57 ) , and the appropriate normalization , @xmath58 , and flux in a given energy band were calculated based on the observed count rate using webpimms .",
    "the effects of galactic neutral hydrogen absorption were negligible .",
    "to avoid reporting anomalous values due to the poisson randomization in our redshifting procedure , and to determine the standard deviation in our values , we iterated the redshifting process 5,000 times for each galaxy , calculating hardness ratio , flux , and luminosity with each iteration .",
    "a gaussian curve was fit to the set of results for each quantity , and we report the resulting mean values and standard deviations in table  [ tab : lums ] .",
    "one of the sources ( ngc 4507 ) had very few counts in the soft band ; the distributions of 0.52 kev flux and luminosity for this object were not gaussian .",
    "we report approximate average values of the soft flux and luminosity of this galaxy and uncertainties that span the range of possible values .",
    "optical data were obtained from the hyperleda database , which provides total @xmath59-band magnitudes and @xmath60 colors of galaxies derived by fitting hubble - type - dependent curves to multiple aperture photometric data @xcite . because observed - frame cousins @xmath21 band ( @xmath61 ) at @xmath0 corresponds approximately to rest - frame johnson @xmath62 band ( @xmath63 ) , we transformed the _ v _ magnitudes from leda into cousins _",

    "[ fig : histo ] we present a histogram of the hardness ratios of the galaxies in our sample , separated based on the presence or absence of starbursts .",
    "we find that non - starburst agns cover a wide range of hardness ratios but are predominantly hard ( @xmath52 @xmath14 0 ) .",

    "has been based on follow - up optical spectroscopy ( and is therefore subject to the limitations of spectroscopic identification , as discussed in @xcite and in   1 of this paper ) , agns generally fall in the region , while quiescent galaxies fall in the region log@xmath22",
    "@xmath23  @xmath24 .",
    "the transition zone of @xmath24  @xmath23  log@xmath22  @xmath23  @xmath76 is populated by both agns and starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "the galaxies of our sample are noticeably optically bright relative to their x - ray fluxes ; more than @xmath77 of them fall below the log@xmath22  =  @xmath76 agn cut - off , and @xmath1@xmath78 reside below log@xmath22",
    "=  @xmath24 , in the realm of normal galaxies .",
    "all but one of the seyfert / starburst sources have log@xmath22  @xmath23  @xmath24 , as do both of the pure starbursts .",
    "the location of most of the redshifted objects in the realm of quiescent and starburst galaxies ( log@xmath22  @xmath23  @xmath24 ) implies that these galaxies would not be recognized as agns if observed at @xmath0 .",
    "the relatively low x - ray luminosities of the majority of the sources ( @xmath79 ) also would not suggest agn presence . this sample is most consistent with the obxf cdf - n sources , many of which",
    "have been identified as normal galaxies .",
    "we find that , when artificially redshifted to @xmath0 , a sample of nearby agns has integrated x - ray properties and x - ray  to  optical flux ratios consistent with the `` normal '' galaxies of deep x - ray surveys . in addition , we see evidence that non - agn emission can significantly affect the shapes of the x - ray spectra of galaxies , as demonstrated by the soft spectra of the agns hosting starbursts in our sample ( figure  [ fig : histo ] ) . distinguishing obscured agns from the high - redshift x - ray detected galaxies whose x - ray emission is purely powered by x - ray binaries and hot gas from starbursts will require more sophisticated diagnostics than simple hardness ratios , x - ray  to  optical flux ratios , and x - ray luminosities .",
    "we also find that longer x - ray observations ( @xmath20310  ms ) will be necessary to detect some of these interesting objects , including starbursts and low - luminosity seyfert galaxies , at @xmath0 .",
    "recognizing that the redshifted galaxy sample presented here is biased , and that objects such as these with @xmath80 are relatively rare in deep field observations , we make no claims about the overall population of deep field objects",
    ". however , this work does offer x - ray support to the optical finding of @xcite that type 2 agns could easily go unrecognized in observations of distant galaxies .",
    "this result has several possible implications :    \\1 .",
    "some fraction of the missing population of type 2 agns thought to comprise the unresolved hard x - ray background could be hidden among the so - called normal , obxf galaxies of deep x - ray surveys .",
    "seyfert - luminosity agns such as the ones studied in this paper can be found at x - ray  to  optical flux ratios @xmath23  @xmath81 , imitating quiescent and starburst galaxies .",
    "their x - ray spectra may be dominated by star formation at the energies to which _ chandra _  and rosat are sensitive , and therefore the hardness ratio may not indicate the level of obscuration or the @xmath14  10  kev brightness of these objects .    \\2 .",
    "x - ray selected studies of galaxies which use criteria such as x - ray luminosity , hardness ratio and x - ray  to  optical flux ratio to segregate normal galaxies and agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could have higher levels of agn contamination than previously estimated .",
    "therefore , studies of smbh accretion may be misled in their analyses of agn evolution by the incomplete identification of x - ray detected sources .",
    "these observational limitations must be worked out before the details of agn evolution can be well understood .",
    "mrk 231 , the only seyfert  1 galaxy included in our sample , provides an interesting case study in potential identification problems with low signal - to - noise ratio x - ray survey data . with broad optical emission lines , @xmath82 , and a moderately hard @xmath83",
    ", this source would likely be identified as an x - ray absorbed seyfert  1 galaxy at @xmath84 .",
    "however , the complex 0.58.0  kev x - ray spectrum includes soft starburst emission , and the direct x - ray continuum is blocked by a compton - thick absorber @xcite . extrapolating simply from the simulated 0.5 - 8.0  kev _ chandra _  survey data would lead to a gross underestimate of the hard x - ray luminosity of this source .",
    "these results will benefit from more careful study with a larger , well - defined sample of nearby galaxies .",
    "overlap with the sample of @xcite , and an extension of their optical spectroscopy study would also be valuable .",
