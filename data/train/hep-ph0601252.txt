    "as can be seen the inclusion of the @xmath211 channels does not modify the order of the states , giving values for the fredholm determinant very close to the ones of the previous model ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this shows that the effect of the coupling to the @xmath42 channels is very small at the three - body level once the coupling to the @xmath42 is included at the two - body level .",
    "the pattern of our results coincides exactly with the observations in the @xmath5 reactions .",
    "in particular , we find only two attractive @xmath86wave channels , with the isospin and energy ordering corresponding to the experimental @xmath6 and @xmath15 states .",
    "we predict for them @xmath271 .",
    "let us remind that the understanding of these states as deeply bound kaonic nuclear systems @xcite would assign the quantum numbers @xmath272 , @xmath20 for the @xmath6 and @xmath273 , @xmath10 for the @xmath15 . if some relativistic effects and a medium - enhanced @xmath274 and spin - orbit interactions are taken into account , the ordering of the isospin channels is reversed to @xmath275 and @xmath276 .",

    "@xcite makes use of a gell - mann - okubo like mass formula to study the spectrum of @xmath277 nona - quark states . the color magnetic interaction between quarks , together with the antisymmetrization of the wave function , favors small multiplets in flavor and spin which gives a natural explanation for the @xmath10 state being the lowest state among the @xmath11 tribaryons with @xmath262 .",
    "this leads to the natural explanation that the @xmath10 state could be a member of the @xmath26plet with @xmath278 , and the @xmath20 state may be a member of the @xmath279plet with @xmath280 .",
    "however other possible classifications that may give rise to @xmath280 for the @xmath6 and the @xmath15 were also discussed .      in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we have shown the fredholm determinant in the case when there is a bound state in the @xmath3 channel . as discussed in subsection [ ii.c ] , the fredholm determinant is real since we have dropped the imaginary part of the propagator @xmath281 in eq .",

    "the fredholm determinant has the form @xmath282 where @xmath283 is a constant and @xmath284 is the energy of the bound state .",
