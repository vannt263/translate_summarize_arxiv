    "analyzing pure quantum states in an infinite dimensional hilbert space it is useful to distinguish a family of _ coherent states _ , localized in the classical phase space and minimizing the uncertainty principle .",
    "these quantum analogues of points in the classical phase space are often considered as classical states . for an arbitrary quantum state",
    "one may pose a natural question , to what extent it is nonclassical in a sense that its properties differ from that of coherent states .",
    "in other words , is there any parameter that may legitimately reflect the degree of nonclassicality of a given quantum state ?",
    "this question was motivated with the first observation of nonclassical features of electromagnetic fields such as sub - poissonian statistics , antibunching and squeezing .",
    "additionally , it is well known that the interaction of ( non)linear devices with quantum states may flip from one state to another ; for instance , nonlinear devices may produce nonclassical states from their interaction with the vacuum or a classical field .",
    "a systematic survey of nonclassical properties of quantum states would be worthwhile because of the nowadays ever increasing number of experiments in nonlinear optics .",
    "an earlier attempt to sheding some light on the nonclassicality of a quantum state was pioneered by mandel @xcite , who investigated the radiation fields and introduced a parameter @xmath0 measuring the deviation of the photon number statistics from the poissonian distribution , characteristic of coherent states .    in general , to define a measure of nonclassicality of quantum states one can follow several different approaches @xcite . distinguishing a certain set @xmath1 of states ( e.g. the set of coherent states @xmath2 ) ,",
    "one looks for the distance of an analyzed pure state @xmath3 to this set , by minimizing a distance @xmath4 over the entire set @xmath1 .",
    "such a scheme based on the trace distance was first used by hillery @xcite , while other distances ( hilbert - schmidt distance @xcite or bures distance @xcite ) were later used for this purpose .",
    "the same approach is also applicable to characterize mixed quantum states : minimizing the distance of the density @xmath5 to the set of coherent states is related @xcite to the search for the maximal fidelity ( the hilbert - schmidt fidelity @xmath6 or the bures - uhlmann fidelity @xmath7 ) with respect to any coherent state , @xmath8 . on the same footing",
    ", the monge distance introduced in @xcite may be applied to describe , to what extent a given mixed state is close to the manifold of coherent states .    yet another way of proceeding",
    "is based on the generalized ( cahill ) phase space representation @xmath9 of a pure state , which interpolates between the husimi ( @xmath10 ) , the wigner ( @xmath11 ) and the glauber ",
    "sudarshan ( @xmath12 ) representations .",
    "the cahill parameter @xmath13 is proportional to the variance of a gaussian function one needs to convolute with @xmath12 representation to obtain @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "in particular for @xmath14 one obtains the q- , w- and p- representations , respectively . by construction",
    "the @xmath10 representation is non - negative for all states , while the wigner function may admit also negative values , and the @xmath12 representation may be singular or may not exist .",
    "the smoothing effect of @xmath9 is enhanced as @xmath13 increases .",
    "if @xmath13 is large enough so that @xmath9 becomes positive definite regular function , thus acceptable as a classical distribution function , then the smoothing is said to be complete .",
    "the greatest lower bound @xmath15 for the critical value was adopted by lee @xcite , as _ nonclassical depth _ of a quantum state and this approach was further developed in @xcite .",
    "the limiting value , @xmath16 , corresponds to the @xmath10 function which is always acceptable as a classical distribution function .",
    "the lowest value , @xmath17 , is ascribed to an arbitrary coherent state because its @xmath12 function is a dirac delta function , so its @xmath18smoothing becomes regular .",
    "the range of @xmath15 is thus @xmath19 $ ] .    if the husimi function of a pure state admits at least one zero @xmath20 , then a cahill @xmath9 distribution with a narrower smearing , @xmath21 , becomes negative in the vicinity of @xmath22 .",
    "therefore the classical depth for such quantum states is maximal , @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the only class of states , for which @xmath10 representation has no zeros , are the squeezed vacuum states , for which @xmath15 is a function of the squeezing parameter @xmath23 . in the limiting case @xmath24 one",
    "obtains the coherent state for which the @xmath25 distribution is a dirac delta function , that is @xmath17 .",
    "a closely related approach to characterizing quantum states is based on properties of their wigner functions in phase space @xmath26 .",
    "one can prove that the wigner function is bounded from below and from above @xcite . in the normalization @xmath27",
    "used later in this work , such a bound reads @xmath28 .",
    "further bound on integrals of the wigner function were derived in @xcite , while an entropy approach to the wigner function was developed in @xcite .    in order to interpret the wigner function as a classical probability distribution one needs to require that @xmath11 is non  negative . as found by hudson in 1974",
    "@xcite , this is the case for coherent or squeezed vacuum states only .",
    "a possible measure of nonclassicality may thus be based on the negativity of the wigner function which may be interpreted as a signature of quantum interference .",
    "the negativity of the wigner function has been linked to nonlocality , according to the bell inequality @xcite , while investigating the original einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) state @xcite .",
    "in fact bell argued that the epr state will not exhibit nonlocal effects because its wigner function is everywhere positive , and as such will allow for a hidden variable description of correlations .",
    "however , it is now demonstrated @xcite that the wigner function of the epr state , though positive definite , provides a direct evidence of nonlocality .",
    "this violation of the bell s inequality holds true for the regularized epr state @xcite and also for a correlated two - mode quantum state of light @xcite .",
    "it is also worth recalling that the wigner function can be measured experimentally @xcite , including the measurements of its negative values @xcite .",
    "the interest put on such experiments has triggered a search for operational definitions of the wigner functions , based on experimental setup @xcite .",
    "the aim of this letter is to study a simple indicator of the nonclassicality , which depends on the _ volume _ of the negative part of the wigner function . to demonstrate a potential use of such an approach we investigate certain families of quantum states .",
    "the nonclassicality indicator is defined in section 2 .",
    "the schrdinger cat state , being constructed as coherent superposition of two gaussian wave packets , is analyzed in section 3 while section 4 is devoted to fock states and to the squeezed displaced fock states . finally in section 5 , a brief discussion of results and perspectives",
    "the wigner function of a state @xmath3 defined by @xcite @xmath29 satisfies the normalization condition @xmath30 .",
    "hence the doubled volume of the integrated negative part of the wigner function may be written as @xmath31 dqdp = \\iint |w_{\\psi } ( q , p)| dqdp -1 \\ . \\label{defclass}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by definition , the quantity @xmath32 is equal to zero for coherent and squeezed vacuum states , for which @xmath11 is non - negative . hence in this work",
    "we shall treat @xmath32 as a parameter characterizing the properties of the state under consideration .",
    "similar quantities related to the volume of the negative part of the wigner function were used in @xcite to describe the interference effects which determine the departure from classical behaviour .",
    "furthermore , a closely related approach was recently advocated by benedict and collaborators @xcite .",
    "their measure of the nonclassicality of a state @xmath3 reads @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the moduli of the integrals over those domains of the phase space where the wigner function is positive and negative , respectively .",
    "the normalization condition implies @xmath36 , so that @xmath37 leads to @xmath38 . using this notation we may rewrite ( [ defclass ] ) as @xmath39 and",
    "obtain a simple relation between both quantities @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "it turns out that both quantities are equivalent in the sense that they induce the same order in the space of pure states : the relation @xmath42 implies @xmath43 .",
    "however , from a pragmatic point of view there exists an important difference between both quantities .    to compute explicitly the quantity ( [ benedict ] )",
    "one faces a difficult task to identify appropriately the domains , in which the integration has to be carried out . on the other hand , knowing the wigner function @xmath44 of a quantum state , it is straightforward to get its absolute value and to evaluate numerically the integration ( [ defclass ] ) .",
    "let us emphasize again that the hilbert space containing all pure states is huge , so one should not expect to characterize the nonclassical features of a quantum state just by a single scalar quantity .",
    "our approach focuses on a particular issue , whether the wigner function is positive and may be interpreted as a classical probability distribution .",
    "therefore , the proposed indicator @xmath32 should be considered as a tool complementary to these worked out earlier and reviewed above .",
    "a quantum state , called _ schrdinger cat _ , is a coherent superposition of two coherent states localized in two distant points of the configuration space , @xmath45 .",
    "the wave function of such a state reads in the position representation @xmath46 \\label{wftion}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 from now on atomic units are used @xmath48 . in other words",
    "we measure the size of the product @xmath49 in units of @xmath50 .",
    "the classical limit @xmath51 means the action @xmath49 characteristic of the system is many order of magnitude larger than @xmath50 .",
    "a glance on eq .",
    "( [ plusmin ] ) reveals that the phase , governed by @xmath52 , is of great importance in that it induces oscillations on the wave function as can be seen in fig.1 .",
    "note that the normalization constant @xmath53 depends on the location of the centers @xmath54 of both coherent states that make up the cat state .",
    "therefore one sees that the wigner function may depend not only on the distance @xmath55 between the both states , but also on their momentum , @xmath52 .",
    "so far , the studies on the cat states @xcite were usually restricted to the case of standing cats , @xmath56 . in this letter",
    "we demonstrate that the parameter @xmath52 influences the shape of the wigner function , in particular , if @xmath57 and both packets are not spatially separated .    inserting @xmath58 into the wigner function ( [ wdef ] ) one obtains @xmath59 here @xmath60 represent two peaks of the distribution centered at the classical phase space points @xmath61 , while @xmath62 stands for the interference structure which appear between both peaks .",
    "normalizing ( [ wftion ] ) yields @xmath63 making use of the formula ( [ wcats ] ) for the wigner function of the cat state @xmath64 its nonclassicality parameter @xmath65 may be approximated by @xmath66 - 1 \\ . \\label{approx}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] strictly speaking the right hand side of equation ( [ approx ] ) forms an upper bound for @xmath67 , which may be practically used as its fair approximation .",
    "because of the oscillations of the absolute value of cosine , it is difficult to perform the integration analytically . in the special case @xmath68 , the superposition of coherent states ( [ wftion ] ) reduces to a single coherent state and correspondingly ( [ approx ] ) leads to @xmath69 .",
    "2 shows plots of the wigner function of the cat states for several values of the separation @xmath70 and the momentum @xmath52 .",
    "one clearly sees the formation of the quantum interference structure halfway between the two humps as the separation distance @xmath70 increases .",
    "the frequency of the interference structure increases with the separation @xcite . for intermediate separations ( @xmath71 ) ,",
    "the wigner function changes its structure with @xmath52 , see fig.2b and 2c .",
    "however , for a larger separation distance , @xmath72 , the wigner function for @xmath73 may be approximated by the wigner function for the state with @xmath56 translated by a constant vector @xmath74 .    in the case of standing cats , ( @xmath56 ) ,",
    "the indicator @xmath32 increases monotonically with the separation @xmath70 , and reflects presence of the interference patterns at @xmath75 - see fig .",
    "the growth of the nonclassicality saturates at @xmath76 , as the interference patterns become practically separated from both peaks , and the parameter @xmath32 tends to the limiting value , @xmath77 . in the limit @xmath78 the oscillations of the cosine term in eq .",
    "( [ approx ] ) become rapid and a crude approximation @xmath79 gives an explicit upper bound @xmath80 .",
    "this picture gets more complicated for the states with @xmath81 , in particular for a small separation distance , @xmath82 . in this case",
    ", @xmath32 exhibits oscillations as shown in fig.4l , 4 m , 4n . to shed some light on this behavior",
    "we have chosen to plot in fig.3 the wigner function for which @xmath83 achieves extremal values .",
    "for instance , @xmath32 at @xmath84 ( fig .",
    "3b ) is smaller than at @xmath85 ( fig .",
    "3a ) or @xmath86 ( fig .",
    "this is due to the the interference structure , which is not symmetric with respect to the reflection @xmath87 , in contrast to the case of cats with @xmath56 .    as shown in fig .",
    "4 , the frequency of oscillations increases with @xmath52 , but the limiting value @xmath88 does not depend on the initial momentum @xmath52 .",
    "this can also be demonstrated , investigating the dependence of the quantity @xmath32 as a function of @xmath52 . as follows from eq .",
    "( [ approx ] ) , the indicator @xmath32 displays regular oscillations with the period @xmath89  see fig .",
    "5 . in other words",
    "a non  zero separation parameter @xmath70 breaks the translational invariance in momentum and introduces a characteristic momentum scale @xmath90 .",
    "note that the amplitudes of the oscillations decrease fast with @xmath70 , so that for well separated cats with @xmath72 the quantity @xmath32 is practically independent on @xmath52 .",
    "let us consider the squeezed displaced fock state defined by @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the original fock state and @xmath93 .",
    "the displacement @xmath94 and the squeezed @xmath95 operators are defined by @xcite @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are usual photon annihilation and creation operators , respectively .",
    "the complex variable @xmath99 represents the magnitude and angle of the displacement .",
    "similarly , writing the complex number in its polar form , @xmath100 , it is easy to see that the radius @xmath23 plays the role of the squeezing strength while the angle @xmath101 indicates the direction of squeezing . it was shown in @xcite that the displacement operators @xmath94 form a complete set of operators .",
    "thus any bounded operator @xmath102 , ( for which the hilbert - schmidt norm @xmath103 is finite ) , can be expressed in the form @xmath104 in which the weight function @xmath105 is unique and square - integrable .",
    "given that every density operator is bounded ( @xmath106 ) , one may write an arbitrary density operator @xmath107 . here",
    "the weight function @xmath108 is just the expectation value of the displacement operator commonly known as characteristic function .",
    "the complex fourier transform of @xmath109 defines the wigner function @xmath110 one may therefore express @xmath109 in terms of the wigner function by performing the inverse fourier transform as @xmath111 so that upon substitution into the density operator expression above , one gets @xmath112 the operators @xmath113 denote @xmath114 so that the wigner function may be interpreted as a weight function for the expansion of the density operator in terms of the operators @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "these operators are hermitian , @xmath115 , and possess the same completeness properties as the displacement operators @xmath116 .",
    "making use of the parity operator @xmath117 , one finally shows that @xmath118 with @xmath119 being the photon number .    in the case of",
    "the squeezed displaced fock states , @xmath120 , the wigner function becomes @xmath121 performing explicitly calculations of matrix elements , one obtains : @xmath122 with @xmath123@xcite . here",
    "@xmath124 denotes the laguerre polynomial of the @xmath125-th order .",
    "the wigner function ( [ wigner ] ) allows us to compute the nonclassicality parameter @xmath126 for a given displaced squeezed fock state @xmath127 . in what follows certain special cases will be investigated such as squeezed displaced vacuum states , pure fock states and squeezed displaced fock states . it will be therefore convenient to represent the complex variable @xmath128 by the position and momentum coordinates , @xmath129 , and treat likewise the displacement operator , @xmath130 .    substituting @xmath131 in eq .",
    "( [ wigner ] ) yields the wigner function for the fock state @xmath92 , @xmath132 l_n\\left[2(q^2+p^2)\\right ]   \\ . \\label{wfstate}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this allows to evaluate analytically the indicator @xmath133 , for @xmath134 @xmath135 since the zeros of the laguerre polynomials are available up to the @xmath136th order . for larger @xmath125 we computed the quantity @xmath133",
    "numerically and plotted in fig .",
    "the indicator @xmath32 grows monotonically with @xmath125 , as the number of zeros of the laguerre polynomial @xmath124 increases with @xmath125 . for",
    "@xmath137 $ ] this dependence may be aproximated by @xmath138 . hence , the larger",
    "the quantum number @xmath125 , the less the wigner function @xmath139 can be interpreted as a classical distribution function .    setting @xmath140 in ( [ wigner ] )",
    "one obtains a squeezed coherent state or squeezed vacuum state . choosing the squeezing angle @xmath141",
    ", one sees that the wigner function is a gaussian centered at the displacement vector ( @xmath142 ) with the shape determined by the squeezing parameter @xmath23 , @xmath143 in such a case the wigner function remains everywhere non ",
    "negative for any choice of the squeezing and displacement parameters @xcite , so that the nonclassicality indicator vanish , @xmath144 .",
    "note that the displacement of any state in phase space does not change the shape of the wigner function , so the quantity @xmath32 is independent of the displacement operator @xmath94 .",
    "furthermore , the squeezing operator @xmath95 influences the shape of the wigner function , but does not lead to a change in the volume of its negative part .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath32 does not also depend on the squeezing .",
    "as an illustration we have chosen the squeezed ( @xmath145 ) displaced ( @xmath146 ) third photon ( @xmath147 ) state , @xmath148 .",
    "the contour plots of the wigner function of such a state are shown in fig . 7 for some values of the squeezing parameter @xmath23 .",
    "the indicator @xmath32 is equal to @xmath149 , irrespective to the squeezing strength .",
    "if squeezing is strong enough , the ring - like wigner function collapses to a quasi one dimensional object with a cigar form .",
    "the squeezed vacuum is often described as a nonclassical state @xcite .",
    "since the quantity @xmath32 does not depend on squeezing , it should not be interpreted as the only parameter which characterizes the nonclassicality . to describe the nonclassical features of the squeezed states one may use , for instance , the nonclassical depth @xcite .",
    "in this work we have proposed a simple indicator of non - classicality which measures the volume of the negative part of the wigner function . although the proposed coefficient @xmath32 is a function of the related quantity @xmath150 , recently introduced by benedict , czirjk et al .",
    "@xcite , it is much easier to compute numerically .",
    "the quantity ( [ defclass ] ) was used to analyze exemplary quantum states , including the schrdinger cat states .",
    "the nonclassicality @xmath32 increases with the separation between the classical points defining the cat state .",
    "this growth saturates , if the separation distance is so large that the quantum interference patterns are well isolated from both main peaks of the distributions .",
    "moreover , for a non  zero momentum @xmath151 , the quantity @xmath32 undergoes oscillations until the separation distance becomes so large that both packets are separated from the interference patterns .",
    "asymptotically , if the separation is large enough , the indicator @xmath32 does not depend on @xmath52 and tends to a constant value , @xmath152 .",
    "in the case of fock states @xmath153 , the quantity @xmath32 equals zero for the coherent vacuum state @xmath154 and grows monotonically with the quantum number @xmath125 .",
    "if a quantum state is displaced by the glauber operator @xmath94 , the shape of the wigner function and the nonclassicality parameter do not change .",
    "although the squeezing operator @xmath95 changes the shape of the wigner function , our results obtained for the squeezed fock states show that the nonclassicality @xmath32 does not depend on squeezing .",
    "the results presented in this work were obtained for pure states of infinite dimensional hilbert space with use of the standard harmonic oscillator coherent states .",
    "it is worth to emphasize that our approach is also suited to analyze mixed quantum states .",
    "furthermore , one may study the similar problem for quantum states of a finite dimensional hilbert space , which was originally tackled in @xcite .",
    "in such a case one defines the husimi function with the help of the @xmath155 , spin coherent states , while the wigner functions may be obtained by expanding the density matrix in the complete basis of the rotation operators @xcite .",
    "the wigner function for finite dimensional systems may also be defined in alternative ways - see @xcite and references therein",
    ". studying the volume of the negative part of the wigner function , defined according to any of these approaches , one may get an interesting information concerning the nonclassical properties of the state analyzed .",
    "for instance some recent attempts @xcite try to link the negativity of the wigner function with the entanglement of analyzed quantum states defined on a composed hilbert space , or with the violation of the bell inequalities .",
