    "complex network theory represents a general unifying formalism under which is possible to understand and rationalize the intricate connectivity and interaction patterns of many natural and man - made systems .",
    "thus , a systematic statistical analysis of large scale dataset has allowed to unveil the existence of apparently universal topological features , shared by a large number of different systems from the technological , social or biological domains @xcite . among these characteristics ,",
    "probably the most intriguing is the discovery of the apparently ubiquitous scale - free ( sf ) nature of the connectivity described by a probability @xmath0 that an element ( vertex ) is connected to other @xmath1 elements ( has degree @xmath1 ) , with a degree exponent usually in the range @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "these and other discoveries have promoted a large modeling activity , aimed at understanding the origin and nature of the observed topological features @xcite . in recent years , the research community has also devoted a great deal of attention to the study of the dynamical processes on complex networks @xcite , which can have important implications in the understanding of real processes such as the spread of epidemics in social systems @xcite or traffic in technological systems as the internet @xcite or transport infrastructures @xcite .",
    "the theoretical understanding of dynamical processes on complex networks is based in the application of mean - field approaches that are essentially based in the annealed network approximation @xcite .",
    "any non - weighted network is fully characterized by its adjacency matrix @xmath3 , taking the value @xmath4 when vertices @xmath5 and @xmath6 are connected by an edge , and zero otherwise . in real ( _ quenched",
    "_ ) networks , the values of the adjacency matrix are fixed and do not change with time .",
    "when a dynamical process takes place on top of such a network , one is considering the network as frozen , with respect to the characteristic time scale @xmath7 of the dynamics .",
    "other networks , however , are dynamical objects , changing in time over a characteristic time scale @xmath8 . in this case , the adjacency matrix is defined only in a statistical sense , and a complete description of the network can be given in terms of its probability distribution @xmath9 and its degree correlations @xmath10 @xcite . in the limit @xmath11 ,",
    "when all edges are completely reshuffled between any two dynamical time steps , the resulting network is called _ annealed _ @xcite .",
    "annealed networks represent an extremely important theoretical tool , because mean - field predictions for dynamical processes turn out to be exact in this kind of substrates @xcite .",
    "dynamical processes with absorbing configurations constitute a subject of outstanding interest in non - equilibrium statistical physics @xcite that have also found a place in network science , as representative models of practical problems ranging from epidemic spreading @xcite , infrastructure s resilience @xcite , or activated dynamics @xcite , to mention just a few .",
    "the simplest lattice model allowing absorbing configurations is the classical contact process ( cp ) @xcite , whose universality class and mean - field ( mf ) description have been discussed along the last few years @xcite . in the cp defined in an arbitrary network , vertices can be in two different states , either empty or occupied .",
    "the dynamics includes the spontaneous annihilation of occupied vertices , which become empty at unitary rate , and the self - catalytic occupation of an empty vertex @xmath5 with rate @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the number of occupied neighbors of @xmath5 and @xmath14 is its degree .",
    "the model is thus characterized by a phase transition at a value of the control parameter @xmath15 , separating an active from an absorbing phase devoid of active vertices . despite of its simplicity",
    ", the cp on sf networks exhibits a very complex critical behavior even if studied in an annealed substrate @xcite .",
    "this case is particularly interesting , since in annealed networks all connections are rewired at a rate much larger than the typical rates involved in the dynamical process , implying that dynamical correlations are absent @xcite . in this case",
    ", the mf approach is expected to be an exact description of the problem .",
    "the configuration in which all vertices are empty plays a very particular role , since once the system has fallen into this state , the dynamics becomes frozen .",
    "for this reason , these states are called absorbing and constitute a central feature in the analysis of finite size systems since , in this case , the single actual stationary state is the absorbing one @xcite . finite size and",
    "absorbing states must therefore be handled using suitable strategies , concomitantly with an ansatz for the finite size scaling ( fss )  @xcite .",
    "a widely adopted procedure is the so called quasi - stationary ( qs ) state @xcite , in which the absorbing configuration is suitably excluded from the dynamics .    in this work",
    ", we present a study of the qs state of the cp on sf annealed networks , combining the qs numerical approach developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , suitably extended to complex networks , with the theoretical analysis of an approximated one - step process derived from mean - field theory @xcite .",
    "our analysis allows us to determine the probability distribution of activity both close to the critical point and in the off - critical regime , as well as to obtain high quality data for relevant qs quantities , such as the density of active sites or the characteristic times .",
    "this last information is used to check the finite - size scaling forms derived from mean - field theory , which turn out to be loaded with very strong corrections to scaling .",
    "the results presented in our paper provide a deeper understanding of the nontrivial dynamics of the contact process in annealed networks . moreover , they open the path to extension of the qs approach to the analysis of other dynamic processes with absorbing phase transitions taking place on more complex and/or realistic substrates such as , for example , quenched networks and small - world topologies @xcite , where edges are never rewired and dynamic correlations are usually present .",

    "in finite systems , the absorbing state is a fixed point that can be visited even in the supercritical phase due to stochastic fluctuations . numerical simulations of finite systems are particularly sensitive to absorbing states and therefore suitable simulation strategies are required .",
    "the standard procedure consists in restricting the averages to those runs that did not visit the absorbing configuration @xcite , the so - called surviving averages . from a mathematical point of view",
    ", it is useful to define the quasi - stationary ( qs ) state that consists of the ensemble of states accessed by the original dynamical process at long times restricted to those not trapped into an absorbing one @xcite .",
    "the intensive quantities in a qs ensemble must converge to the stationary ones in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "thus , in the active phase , the lifespan grows exponentially fast with the system size and the qs state becomes identical to the stationary one . in the sub - critical phase ,",
    "on the other hand , the activity in the qs state corresponds only to a few @xmath16 $ ] particles fluctuating above the absorbing state implying a density that vanishes inversely proportional to the system size .",
    "formally , the qs state is related with the original one in the limit @xmath17 by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the qs probability associated to the state @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the survival probability , i.e. , the probability that the system is active up to time @xmath22 . for a one - step process , the state of the system is completely determined by the number of occupied vertices @xmath23 .",
    "letting @xmath24 be the probability that the system has @xmath23 particles at time @xmath22 , the qs distribution @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 , for which the normalization @xmath27 applies .",
    "the probability of visiting the absorbing state is redistributed among the active configurations , proportionally to @xmath25 , which constitutes the essence of the qs state @xcite .",
    "knowledge of the qs distribution allows to compute the standard quantities associated to this state .",
    "for example , the probability to visit the vacuum in the cp is given by @xmath28 , independently of the network substrate .",
    "thus , it is straightforward to show that the survival probability and the pre - absorbing state are related by @xmath29 providing a characteristic time scale @xcite @xmath30 analogously , the density of active sites in the qs state is given by @xmath31    the standard numerical procedure to simulate the qs regime based on averages over survival runs has a limited accuracy due to the very rare achievement of surviving configurations at very large times .",
    "thus , for instance , the stationary densities are determined as a plateau at long times in the curve @xmath32 that is usually noisy and short close to or below the criticality due to the limited number of independent runs computationally accessible .",
    "the previous interpretation of the qs state provides an alternative simulation strategy , in which every time the system visits the absorbing state , this configuration is replaced by an active one randomly taken from the history of the simulation @xcite . for this task ,",
    "a list with @xmath33 active configurations is stored and constantly updated .",
    "an update consists in randomly choosing a configuration in the list and replacing it by the present active configuration with a probability @xmath34 .",
    "after a relaxation time @xmath35 , the qs distributions are determined during an averaging time @xmath36 .",
    "the improved qs method has been successfully applied to accurately determine the universality class of several models with absorbing configurations @xcite .",
    "the network in which dynamics takes place is assumed to be annealed and therefore completely characterized by the degree distribution @xmath9 , the probability that a randomly chosen vertex has a degree @xmath1 , and the degree correlation function @xmath37 defined as the conditional probability that a vertex of degree @xmath1 is connected to a vertex of degree @xmath38 @xcite .",

    "the qs distribution and the relevant qs quantities ( density of active sites and characteristic time ) determined in this way show an excellent agreement with direct qs numerical simulations of the contact process , both at criticality and in the supercritical regime .",
    "the high accuracy of our data allows to identify strong corrections to the scaling in the critical quantities that mask the correct finite size scaling exponents obtained analytically by means of an exact mean - field solution . both critical density and characteristic time show",
    "tenuous curvatures as functions of the network size @xmath39 due to finite size corrections to scaling that may provide incorrect exponents if a simple power law decay is assumed .",
    "in annealed networks , for which the critical point is exactly known , we can determine the corrections to scaling analytically and thus recover the theoretical exponents in the finite size analysis , including the abrupt change when the network loses its sf property .",
    "the analysis of the supercritical region , on the other hand , hints that those finite size corrections are also relevant for very large network sizes .",
    "indeed , the asymptotic scaling is observable only for extremely large values of @xmath39 , much larger than those possibly attainable with present day computers .",
    "it is worth noticing that the qs analysis presented in this work is equivalent to the langevin approach developed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the limit of very low densities ( i.e. in the critical region , see appendix ) .",
    "the main difference is that the former starts from an approximation of the original dynamical processes [ eq . ( [ eq : ratesonestep ] ) ] , while the latter represents an exact langevin approach in the coarse - grained limit ( density approximated by a continuous variable ) .",
    "the critical advantage of the present approach lies on the fact that our me analysis allows to determine the critical properties in a very intuitive way , as well as to easily obtain highly accurate results , free from statistical errors , for all quantities of interest .",
    "our work opens the path to a more detailed characterization of absorbing phase transitions on scale - free networks in general , and the cp in particular . in the more realistic framework of quenched networks , in which edges are frozen and",
    "do not change , this goal may be however hindered by the interplay between corrections to scaling and the usual lack of knowledge about the true position of the critical point .",
    "in fact , the standard characterization of the qs state by the usual procedure assuming a simple power law of the system size at the critical point may be affected by two sources of errors : the analysis may be misleadingly done off the critical point and/or be affected by important scaling corrections . further work in this direction , following the proposed lines , might thus help to throw light on the numerical assessment of the correct critical scaling of absorbing phase transitions on heterogeneous networks .",
