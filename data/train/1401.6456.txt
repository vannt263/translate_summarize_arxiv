    "observations of the galactic center ( gc ) going back as far as 20 years ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) reveal three facts : ( 1 ) an isotropic cusp of young o / b and wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars , starting at a distance of @xmath3 from sgra@xmath1 and extending inward to about @xmath0 ( @xmath4 pc ) ; ( 2 ) a mildly thick stellar _ disk _ , of about @xmath5 wr and o - type stars , spanning from an inner radius of @xmath0 to an outer radius of about @xmath6 ; and ( 3 ) populating the innermost region , within @xmath0 from sgra@xmath1 , are a population of b stars , commonly referred to as the `` s - stars '' , but _ no _ wr / o stars .",
    "a single star - formation ( sf ) episode may have explained the formation of disk and cusp stars @xcite , the s - stars , however , can not have been born in this scenario , because the violent environmental conditions within @xmath0 do not allow in - situ sf . one way of populating that region is by dynamical friction , but the associated timescale is too long . for this reason ,",
    "the problem has the reputation of the `` paradox of youth '' @xcite .",
    "this issue has led to the idea that s - stars could have formed at larger radii and brought in later by an efficient dynamical mechanism .",
    "one possibility is tidal separation of binaries @xcite .",
    "a binary , formed at larger radius , can be set in such an orbit that at periapsis it will be tidally separated by the central massive black hole ( mbh ) , leaving one star , which could be a b star , bound to the mbh at a typical radius of @xmath7 .",
    "however , the captured stars would have very high eccentricities , typically about @xmath8 ( see the original work of @xcite and @xcite for a review ) .",
    "it would require some @xmath9 myr for them to achieve the observed near - thermal distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with the aid of a very dense cusp of segregated old stars which is in contradiction with current observations @xcite .",
    "even in the presence of a dense cusp , there are two additional issues : ( 1 ) the same process would work for wr / o stars , and we do _ not _ see them within @xmath10 @xcite and ( 2 ) the oldest o / wr stars are @xmath11 myr , so there has to be at least two sf episodes , since s - stars inside @xmath0 need @xmath12 myr to thermalize .",
    "since the stellar disk initially must be gaseous , it has been proposed as another possibility that b stars migrated in it towards the center @xcite .",
    "however , ( 1 ) this can not explain the eccentricities of the s - stars because the migrating stars will remain on near - circular orbits @xcite , and ( 2 ) wr / o stars would have migrated towards the center due to the same mecahnism , but we do not observe them there . once sf is over ( no more gas ) , the stars in the disk , including the wr / o stars , would secularly torque each other and drift away from nearly - circular orbits to rather eccentric ones @xcite , and hence at periapsis they would populate the central @xmath0 , but , still , we do not see wr / o - stars there either .    in this letter",
    "we show that , provided the disk was heavier and more extended in the past @xcite , it created a rapid evolving region ( rer ) inside @xmath13 , where the angular momenta of stars rapidly redistribute because of a kozai - lidov - like resonance .",
    "this rer can explain both the eccentricities of s - stars and the absence of wr / o - stars because the latter are tidally disrupted .",
    "to understand the effect of the disk , we first analyze the torque exerted by a wire of mass @xmath14 and radius @xmath15 on a background star of semi - major axis @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the timescale for the wire to change the angular momentum of the star by a full cycle , i.e. to vary the eccentricity @xmath17 of the star from its minimum value to the maximum and back , is    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the mass of the mbh , and @xmath20}}\\right)^{3/2}~{\\rm yr}$ ] is the orbital period of the star .",
    "the reason for @xmath21 is a requirement for having all orbits within the radius of the wire , including the most eccentric ones , @xmath22 , with @xmath23 the apocenter distance .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : tk ] ) is a generalization of the secular kozai - lidov ( kl ) timescale ( see * ? ? ? * and references therehin ) : ( 1 ) in the regime @xmath24 we recover this well - known secular phenomenon but ( 2 ) when @xmath25 , i.e. when stellar orbits _ cross _ a sphere with a radius of the wire , it provides good approximation to the non - deterministic ( nd ) , but not necessarily chaotic , evolution of the stellar orbit .    admitting that an extended disk is a superposition of wires",
    ", one can derive the corresponding timescale @xmath26 for the sum of torques to change the orbital elements of a star in a full cycle @xcite :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote the inner and outer radii of the disk , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the surface density of the disk . during @xmath26 ,",
    "when secular evolution predominates , a star typically oscillates a full cycle between the maximum and minimum eccentricities , which are predetermined by three orbital parameters , namely eccentricity , position angle of periapsis ( @xmath32 ) , and inclination angle relative to the disk ( @xmath33 ) . at any intermediate stage of that cycle , the `` instantaneous '' evolution timescale , defined as @xmath34 ,",
    "can be derived from    @xmath35    ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath36 is the dimensionless angular momentum and the dot denotes the time derivative .",
    "the linear dependence on @xmath37 reflects the coherence of the disk torque during @xmath38 .",
    "the mbh and cusp stars affect the kl - like evolution by perturbing the orbital parameters @xmath39 .",
    "we must distinguish two regimes : ( 1 ) at _ high _ @xmath17 , @xmath32 is significantly perturbed , because of the induced relativistic ( gr ) precession rate ,    @xmath40    with @xmath41 the speed of light .",
    "it may even exceed the kl precession rate ,    @xmath42    ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "when this happens , the disk coherence is broken and the kl cycle quenched , hence it defines a boundary to the region in phase space where the evolution is driven by the disk . in some",
    "loose sense , this boundary is analogous to the schwarzschild barrier in galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) at _ low _",
    "@xmath17 , the perturbation on @xmath32 originates from the total stellar mass @xmath43 enclosed by the orbit .",
    "the newtonian precession rate    @xmath44\\ ] ]    may exceed @xmath45 in this regime , which imposes a second boundary @xcite .",
    "outside these boundaries , evolution of angular - momentum will be determined by either two - body relaxation , with a characteristic timescale of    @xmath46    ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or ( scalar ) resonant relaxation ( rr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , on a timescale of    @xmath47    ( * ? ? ?",
    "* who studied the dependence on @xmath17 ) . in equations  ( [ eqn : t2b ] ) and ( [ eqn : trr ] )",
    ", @xmath48 denotes the average mass of one star , @xmath49 is the number of stars enclosed by the stellar orbit , @xmath50 is the coulomb logarithm , and @xmath51 is the joint precession timescale combining newtonian , gr , and kl precessions @xcite .    between the two boundaries is the rer : any star in it cycles between the maximum and minimum eccentricities predetermined by @xmath39 .",
    "moreover , the two extrema are evolving .",
    "the corresponding timescale is given by vectorial rr @xcite , which changes @xmath33 on a timescale of    @xmath52    @xcite .",
    "inside rer , @xmath53 is longer than the newtonian and gr precession timescales , so vectorial rr does not impact the boundaries .",
    "its role is to characterize the required time for a star to explore in a random - walk - fashion the range of maxima and minima in eccentricities fenced in by the boundaries of the rer .",
    "the boundaries of the rer are changing because the properties of the disk have changed during the past ( @xmath54 ) myr .",
    "we can distinguish two stages in the evolution of the disk .",
    "* an early phase in which the disk was mostly gaseous and its inner edge reached the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) at about @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "this disk contained at least @xmath56 of gas , to trigger fragmentation and star formation @xcite , and it could have been as massive as @xmath57 according to recent simulations @xcite .",
    "we will adopt a disk mass of @xmath58 for this phase .",
    "it is worth noting that stars formed in the outer disk may migrate inward @xcite , so the disk inside @xmath59 pc could contain both gas and stars . * today , after some @xmath60 myr , the central @xmath61 pc of the disk is no longer present , because the gas is consumed by either star formation @xcite or black - hole accretion @xcite , and the stars have had time to be scattered out of the disk plane due to vectorial rr @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we say the inner edge of the disk has _",
    "receded _ from the isco to the current location of @xmath62 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the outer edge is still the same , at @xmath63 .",
    "the present mass of the disk is @xmath64 @xcite .    in both situations , we modeled the disk surface density as a power - law of @xmath65 @xcite , which leads to a mass of @xmath66 at @xmath67 in the early phase .",
    "to derive @xmath43 and @xmath68 in equations  ( [ eqn : omegam])-([eqn : tvrr ] ) , we adopted the broken - power - law model from observations @xcite , whose density slop is @xmath69 for the inner @xmath70 pc .",
    "we assumed an average stellar mass of @xmath71 ( also see * ? ? ? * for discussions ) . in this model , we have @xmath72 for stars in the central arcsec of the galaxy .",
    "in figure  [ fig.1 ] we display the boundaries of the rer .",
    "the left panel corresponds to @xmath73 and the right one to @xmath74 . in this @xmath75 ",
    "@xmath16 plane , at any location , we can estimate the instantaneous evolution timescale as :    @xmath76    we can then identify the lines with constant evolution timescales , i.e. the contours .",
    "we call them `` isochrones '' , and depict them as blue dotted curves . outside the rer",
    "the isochrones are shown in grey and determined by either two - body scattering , @xmath77 , or rr process , @xmath78 , whichever timescale is shorter .    two striking conclusions from a first look at this figure",
    "are ( 1 ) stars in the rer evolve on very short timescales , of the order of @xmath79 yrs , to complete a full kl cycle . as discussed previously ,",
    "after a time of @xmath53 , any star at @xmath80 would have _ fully _ explored the angular - momentum range within the rer .",
    "( 2 ) as the disk recedes , the boundaries come closer and the rer shrinks .",
    "any star that finds itself out of the rer will be `` frozen '' from the point of view of another star which still is in it : the timescales outside rer are long .    since short evolution timescale leads to low probability of stellar distribution , today ( right panel of figure  [ fig.1 ] )",
    ", the absence of s - stars within the rer boundaries may be a plausible observational corroboration that the rer does exit at the gc . at present , the only measured object within the rer boundaries is g2 ( red dots , * ? ? ?",
    "from its nearby isochrones , we see that g2 must have been formed less than @xmath81 years ago .",
    "the two more successful scenarios of depositing b stars close to the gc , i.e. binary separation and disk migration , place these stars well within the rer ( left panel of figure  [ fig.1 ] ) .",
    "these stars are able to sufficiently mix in angular - momentum space , on a timescale of @xmath82 myr in the binary - separation scenario and of @xmath83 myr in the disk - migration one .",
    "the latter mechanism ( disk migration ) requires much longer time to reach the superthermal distribution in eccentricities becasue of the @xmath17 dependence of equation  ( [ eqn : tvrr ] ) .",
    "we note that these timescales are at least @xmath84 times shorter than those from the earlier models , which neglected the rer .",
    "the fully - mixed eccentricities do not necessarily have a thermal distribution ( brem et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "following the argument that longer evolution timescale correlates with higher probability distribution , we will have @xmath85 , and substituting equation  ( [ eqn : thori ] ) for @xmath86 , we can derive @xmath87 .",
    "this distribution function is steeper than a thermal one , @xmath88 .",
    "the steepness stems from the linear dependence of the evolution timescale ( @xmath89 ) on the orbital angular momentum @xmath37 , whereas in the case of two - body relaxation and rr , the evolution time scales with @xmath90 .",
    "figure  [ fig.2 ] compares various cumulative probability distribution functions ( cpdfs ) for @xmath17 , derived from two theoretical models a thermal one and our rer model as well as from observations .",
    "it is clear that compared to the thermal distribution , the rer one is in better agreement with the observations .      for a star of mass @xmath48 and radius",
    "@xmath91 , if its eccentricity becomes so high that the orbital pericenter distance from sgra@xmath1 becomes smaller than the tidal radius    @xmath92    it will be tidally disrupted @xcite . in figure  [ fig.1 ]",
    "we show typical @xmath93 associated with b , o , and wr stars .",
    "once stars cross it from the right to the left , they are lost .",
    "this drain is enhanced in the rer by the shorter and shorter timescales , as the stars progressively move to the left .    to calculate @xmath93 , we assume @xmath94 respectively for the three types of stars @xcite",
    ". main - sequence stars less massive than @xmath95 are below the current detection limit of observations .",
    "correspondingly , we have adopted @xmath96 for main - sequence b stars , and @xmath97 and @xmath98 respectively for o- and wr stars .",
    "b stars can be envisaged as main - sequence stars , but o- and wr stars are more massive , and shorter - lived .",
    "we hence adopt larger radii for them , 34 times larger than typical radii on the main - sequence , since they have evolved off the main sequence @xcite .",
    "we can see in the left panel of figure  [ fig.1 ] that any wr star in a stripe defined between @xmath99 and any o star in @xmath100 will be tidally disrupted , because it will have explored all the @xmath75 space in @xmath101 yrs .",
    "similarly , for b stars , the corresponding stripe is delimited by the narrower zone @xmath102 .",
    "in fact , this predicted gap ( for b stars ) does occur in the current distribution of s - stars ( right panel of figure  [ fig.1 ] ) .",
    "if we had assumed a disk mass of @xmath103 , this gap would have broadened to incorporat the region where @xmath104 , and it would contradict current observations .",
    "therefore , an upper limit to the disk mass can be derived , approximately @xmath105 .    by looking at the left panel again ,",
    "we realize that only wr / o stars with @xmath106 and low @xmath17 can survive , because they are always outside of the rer and can not drift quickly enough to higher @xmath17 . indeed , wr / o stars have been discovered only at @xmath107 but not inside . in principle , our model can not deplete wr / o stars at @xmath108 , because at such small @xmath16 the rer does not reach the tidal radii .",
    "observations did not find any wr / o star there , maybe because the extrapolation of the disk density profile @xmath109 results in @xmath110 wr / o star at @xmath111 .",
    "in this letter we have presented a picture that explains the distribution of the eccentricities of s - stars and the absence of more massive stars within @xmath0 of sgra@xmath1 .",
    "our _ sole _ hypothesis is that around @xmath60 myr ago , the disk had extended down to @xmath112 pc .",
    "we find that the torque exerted by the disk creates a region at the gc in which the dynamical evolution is significantly accelerated as compared to other regions , by a factor ranging from 10 to 100 times , and we call it the `` rapid evolving region '' .",
    "our scenario agrees with current observations about the nonexistence of an old segregated cusp in the gc @xcite , contrary to other works , which crucially rely on the cusp to thermalize the s - stars @xcite . because the time that is needed to randomize angular momentum is now shortened to @xmath113 myr , our model is able to accommodate various possibilities for the formation of s - stars , while other models rely heavily on when s - stars were brought to the gc @xcite .",
    "moreover , our rer scenario unifies two observational facts that have been thought until now to be disconnected : we successfully populate the observed range of @xmath17 for b stars and we can duplicate the observed discontinuity of wr / o stars above and below @xmath0 . both of them will be established in as short as @xmath113 myr , so we can even unify the origin of all the young stellar populations in the gc to _ only one single sf episode_. this unification does pose a problem for earlier models : if all b stars formed simultaneously with wr / o stars , since this must be less than 6 myr ago ( because wr / o stars can not be older ) , two - body relaxation and rr will fail to explain the distribution of @xmath17 .    at this stage",
    ", it is crucial to theoretically understand the dynamical response of the old stellar population to the rer , and test it against the observations of dimmer ( than b - type ) , older stars .",
    "if they match , it would be a robust evidence that the rer has indeed played a role in sculpting the gc .",
