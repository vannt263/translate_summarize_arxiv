    "the kepler problem is a completely integrable hamiltonian system with important applications in the physical world : it provides a very accurate model of the motion of planets in the solar system , and its quantized equivalent provides a good model of the hydrogen atom .",
    "moreover , several features of the kepler problem make it very interesting for the mathematician : some of its motions ( those in which there is a collision of the moving point with the attractive centre ) are not defined for all times , but the system can be regularized , _",
    "i.e. _ mapped into a new hamitonian system whose motions are defined for all times ; the lie algebra of infinitesimal symmetries of a given energy level of the phase space depends on that energy level .    in section  [ conformallyfields ]",
    "some results in symplectic geometry are presented .",
    "these results will be used in section  [ kepler ] to explain why a diffeomorphism between the phase space of the kepler problem , restricted to negative values ( resp .",
    "positive values ) of the energy , and an open subset of the cotangent space to a 3-dimensional sphere ( resp . , a 3-dimensional two - sheeted hyperboloid ) is symplectic .",
    "that diffeomorphism was discovered by gyrgyi  @xcite ( 1968 ) , re - discovered by ligon and schaaf  @xcite ( 1976 ) and discussed by cushman and duistermaat  @xcite ( 1997 ) , who have shown that it is characterized by the three very natural properties :    1 .",
    "it maps the set of points in the phase space of the kepler problem where the energy is negative ( resp . , positive ) onto the tangent bundle of the @xmath9-sphere ( resp .",

    "2 .   it intertwines the kepler and delaunay vector fields ( a rescaling of the geodesic vector field on the @xmath9-sphere , or on the @xmath9-dimensional hyperboloid ) .",
    "3 .   it intertwines the @xmath10-momentum mappings of the kepler and delauney vector fields .",
    "we will see that the remarkable properties of that diffeomorphism appear as very natural consequences of the results presented in section  [ conformallyfields ] .",
    "we will also discuss the weak infinitesimal symmetries of the kepler problem , and we will show that their set is a lie algebroid with a zero anchor map , rather than a lie algebra .    after completion and submission of the present paper ,",
    "the work of gert  heckman and tim  de  laat  @xcite , recently posted on arxiv , was indicated to us .",
    "the method used by these authors to explain the properties of the gyrgyi - ligon - schaaf diffeomorphism rests on the same ideas as ours .",

    "second , in section entiteled getting back the time @xmath49 ; bacry s generators  of his 1968 paper , gyrgyi composes the map @xmath223 with a suitably chosen map deduced from the flow of the kepler vector field .",
    "he did not prove that the map he finally obtained is symplectic .",

    "twenty years later , r.  h.  cushman and j.  j.  duistermaat  @xcite discussed the properties of that diffeomorphism , gave new proofs of its remarkable properties and stated the nice characterization indicated in the introduction .",
    "for negative values of the energy , the gyrgyi - ligon - schaaf diffeomorphism is the map which , to each element @xmath225 of the phase space of the kepler problem such that @xmath226 , associates the element @xmath227 of @xmath228 @xmath229 in these formulae @xmath18 is the angle given , as a function of @xmath225 , by @xmath230 the quantities @xmath231 and @xmath232 are vectors of @xmath233 , while @xmath234 and @xmath235 are vectors of @xmath236 , such that @xmath237 in other words , @xmath238 is a point of the sphere @xmath239 of radius 1 centered at the origin , embedded in @xmath236 ( endowed with its usual euclidean metric ) , and @xmath240 is a non - zero vector tangent to that sphere at point @xmath238 . using the usual scalar product of @xmath236 to identify vectors and covectors , we may consider @xmath241 as an element of the cotangent bundle to the sphere @xmath239 minus its zero section .    for positive values of the energy ,",
    "the gyrgyi - ligon - schaaf diffeomorphism is given by similar formulae , the trigonometric functions @xmath242 and @xmath243 being replaced by the hyperbolic functions @xmath244 and @xmath245 and the euclidean metric on @xmath236 by the lorentz pseudo - euclidean metric .",
    "we will show in what follows that the gyrgyi - ligon - schaaf symplectic diffeomorphism can be easily obtained , and that all its properties can be proven , by an adaptation of moser s method for the regularization of the kepler problem and application of theorem  [ result1 ] .",
    "that method rests on the fact that hodographs of the kepler problem are circles or arcs of circles , and that the stereographic projection maps circles into circles .",
    "we do not need to know in advance that the eccentricity vector @xmath218 is a first integral of the kepler problem , since this property is an easy consequence of moser s method .      in 1935 , v.  a.  fock  @xcite used an inverse stereographic projection for the determination of the energy levels of hydrogen atoms in quantum mechanics .",

    "as explained by d.  v.  anosov  @xcite and j.  milnor  @xcite , the method can easily be adapted for motions with a fixed , positive energy : instead of a three - dimensional sphere , one should use one sheet of a two - sheeted three - dimensional hyperboloid of revolution , and one obtains a correspondence between oriented hodographs of motions of the kepler problem with the chosen positive energy , and connected components of great hyperbolas drawn on that sheet of hyperboloid ( that means intersections of that sheet of hyperboloid with a plane containing the symmetry centre ) .    to deal with cases @xmath246 and @xmath247 simultaneously , we introduce the auxiliary quantity @xmath248 let @xmath249 be an orthonormal frame of @xmath150 . with @xmath154 as origin .",

    "we see that the map @xmath224 sends the hamiltonian vector field of the kepler problem to a conformally hamiltonian vector field , with @xmath85 as hamiltonian and with @xmath2 as conformal factor .      unlike the conformal factor @xmath2 , which becomes singular on the cotangent space to @xmath484 at the north pole , the hamiltonian @xmath85 is smoothly defined on the whole cotangent bundle @xmath493 minus the zero section .",
    "the associated hamiltonian vector field @xmath83 is complete .",
    "its flow , defined on @xmath494 , @xmath495 has slightly different expressions for @xmath258 ( negative energy ) and for @xmath259 ( positive energy ) .",
    "observe that @xmath496 is a first integral of @xmath83 .",
    "@xmath497 @xmath498 we have set @xmath499 .      at the end of subsection  [ smap ] , we have seen that the image by @xmath224 of the hamiltonian vector field @xmath486 of the kepler problem is a conformally hamiltonian vector field @xmath341 defined on an open dense subset of @xmath500 , whose hamiltonian @xmath85 is smoothly defined on the whole @xmath500 ; the corresponding hamiltonian vector field @xmath83 is complete .",
    "moreover the conformally hamiltonian vector field @xmath341 is also hamiltonian , with hamiltonian @xmath85 , not for the canonical symplectic form of @xmath493 , but for the pull - back by @xmath217 of the canonical symplectic form of @xmath268 .",
    "we have seen in subsection  [ levi - civitaparameter ] that for every solution @xmath501 of the equations of motion of the kepler problem , @xmath502 the conformal factor @xmath2 , whose expression is given at the end of subsection  [ smap ] , may also be expressed as @xmath503 therefore @xmath504 all the integral curves of the conformally hamiltonian vector field @xmath341 can be written @xmath505 where @xmath501 is a solution of the equations of motion of the kepler problem .",

    ". that theorem can therefore be applied .",
    "it proves that by composing the symplectic diffeomorphism @xmath224 with the flow @xmath508 of the hamiltonian vector field @xmath83 , for suitably chosen values of the independent variable @xmath104 , we get a symplectic diffeomorphism from the phase space of the kepler problem , restricted either to negative , or to positive energies , onto an open subset of @xmath493 .",

    "finally we see that the symplectic diffeomorphism so obtained is that of gyrgyi , ligon and schaaf .",
    "r.  cushman and l.  bates , in chapter ii of the book  @xcite , offer a detailed discussion of its properties , notably its behaviour with respect to the liouville @xmath133-forms of the cotangent spaces of the kepler configuration manifold and of the @xmath9-dimensional sphere ( or hyperboloid ) .",
    "the properties of the diffeomorphism from the phase space of the kepler problem to the cotangent bundle of a sphere or of an hyperboloid are explained , in subsection  [ smap ] , from a point of view other than that used by cushman and duistermaat  @xcite .",
    "our explanation is founded on a very natural property of conformally hamiltonian vector fields .",
    "however , the procedure we used , as well as those used by gyrgyi  @xcite , ligon and schaaf  @xcite remains unsatisfactory in the fact that it handles separately negative and positive energy levels .",
    "the space of motions of the kepler problem is connected , since by varying slowly the energy level , an elliptic motion can be transformed into a parabolic , then into an hyperbolic motion . by completely different methods , j .-",
    "souriau  @xcite proposed a global description of the manifold of motions of the kepler problem , of its regularization and of its global and infinitesimal symmetries .",
    "it should be possible to do something similar at the level of the phase space instead of at the level of the manifold of motions .",
    "the fact that the kepler vector field is hamiltonian with respect to a symplectic form and conformally hamiltonian with respect to another syplectic form is remarkable ; it is probably related to the complete integrability of that vector field , as suggested by an anonymous referee . in  @xcite , a.  maciejewski , m.  prybylska and a.  tsiganov",
    "have used conformally hamiltonian vector fields within the theory of bi - hamiltonian systems , to build completely integrable systems .",
    "we have shown that the infinitesimal symmetries of the kepler problem form a lie algebroid rather than a lie algebra .",
    "actions of lie algebroids on symplectic manifolds is a subject which seems to us interesting ; it should be nice to have other examples of hamiltonian vector fields whose infinitesimal symmetries form a lie algebroid , maybe with a non - zero anchor map .",
    "a.  douady and m.  lazard  @xcite have shown that lie algebroids with a zero anchor map are integrable into lie groupoids ; it would be interesting to write down explicitly the action of a lie groupoid with the groups @xmath351 , @xmath518 and @xmath353 as isotropy groups on a regularized phase space of the kepler problem .",
    "i am much indebted towards my colleagues and friends of the centre international de thories variationnelles , the international workshop on differential geometric methods in mechanics and the seminar of hamiltonian geometry for helpful discussions , towards alan weinstein who , after listening to a presentation of a preliminary version of this work , made several enlighting observations , and towards alain guichardet and alain albouy who communicated me their unpublished papers on the kepler problem .",
