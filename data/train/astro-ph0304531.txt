    "two bipolar outflows have been identified in the system @xcite .",
    "one of the outflows runs nw - se and has been associated with the embedded pair t tau s. analysis of the forbidden line emission indicates that this outflow is poorly collimated @xcite .",

    "the other outflow runs e - w and is associated with t tau n. it is less bright in the optical , although high velocity forbidden line emission is detected towards the west , ending in herbig haro object hh155 located at the edge of the reflection nebulosity ngc 1555 ( hind s nebula ) , @xmath6 35 '' west from the star .",
    "@xmath7co emission associated with the e - w outflow shows blue and redshifted lobes of moderately high velocity ( schuster et al .",
    "1994 ) , surrounded by rings of @xmath8co emission at lower velocity ; these rings have been interpreted as arising at the wall of the cavity in the envelope opened by the e - w outflow ( momose et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the structure of the outflows and molecular gas and dust very near t tau ( inner 2``x2 '' ) is uncertain .",
    "observations in the v , r , and i filters with the wfpc2 camera on the hubble space telescope ( @xmath9 ) by stapelfeldt ( 1998 , s98 ) showed a scattered light structure whose morphology suggests an illuminated outflow cavity in the circumsystem envelope .",
    "spectroscopic mapping in the k ( 2.01 - 2.42 @xmath10 m ) and h ( 1.5 - 1.8 @xmath10 m ) bands by @xcite probed the inner 2``@xmath02 '' of the t tau system ; unresolved br@xmath11 emission at the positions of t tau n and s was observed , but no infrared h@xmath1 emission was detected .    in contrast , space - based observations in the uv of molecular hydrogen have indicated structure on small scales near t tau .",

    "@xcite refined the location of the h@xmath1 emission by comparing data from the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) on @xmath9 in g140l mode with all the available iue spectra of t tau .",
    "the h@xmath1 line fluxes were found to be larger in the iue spectra suggesting that the molecular hydrogen emission extended beyond 0.2 \" from the star , the size of the small science aperture in ghrs . in this paper",
    ", we present new data from the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on board @xmath9 which illustrate the spatial distribution of fluorescent h@xmath1 emission in the t tau system , with important implications for the interaction of outflows and circumstellar matter .",
    "t tauri was observed with @xmath9 on 2000 february 7 in program go8317 , using the stis mama detector with the g140l grating .",
    "a 2 `` long slit with a pa=@xmath12 was employed , and the data were taken in binned pixels mode with an exposure time of 1622 s. the spectral range covered from 1118 to 1715  with a dispersion of 0.58  per pixel resulting in a resolution of @xmath131  at 1500  , and a plate scale of 0.024 '' per pixel .",
    "standard calstis pipeline procedures were used to reduce the data .",
    "figure 1 shows the position - dispersion image .",
    "faint emission is seen extending roughly 1.6 \" @xmath6 240 au southward from the ultraviolet image of t tau n. some extended emission is seen to the north , but to a much smaller extent .",
    "the spectra of the extended emission were extracted using standard iraf / stsdas / x1d tasks , although the extraction was difficult because the spectra have low signal - to - noise ( @xmath6 8 for the strongest lines ) and because extended structures fill the large aperture in the dispersion direction .",
    "for the extraction , the position of the background was taken outside of the range corresponding to the geocoronal lyman @xmath2 and o i lines and far from the extended emission ; the background was the same for all the spectra , averaged over 10 pixels .",
    "the signal along the extended emission is weak , roughly 20 times weaker than the stellar spectrum .",
    "line emission accounts for about 50% of the total signal .",
    "we attempt to identify the strongest emission features , recognizing that there may be weaker , more diffuse emission that we can not trace .",
    "figure 2 shows the spectrum of t tau n , scaled by a factor of 0.2 , and spectra extracted in 10 pixel = 0.24 `` boxes at various offsets from the star along the slit orientation .",
    "lines from the highly - ionized species si iv 1393/1402 , c iv 1458/1550 , and he ii 1640 are present in the stellar spectrum ; the corresponding emission features in the spectra offset at @xmath14 0.39 '' are consistent with the expected wings of the instrumental point spread function for the stellar emission .",
    "the other line features in the extended nebulosity are consistent with fluorescent h@xmath1 emission .",
    "as shown in figure 2 , the strongest lines arising from de - excitation of the rotational - vibrational level ( v,j=1,4 ) of the electronic state @xmath15 populated by the ( 1 - 2)p(5 ) transition can be identified .",
    "there is also a suggestion that the strongest lines of the de - excitation of the ( v,j=1,7 ) level , populated by the ( 1 - 2)r(6 ) transition are present .",
    "table 1 shows the observed fluxes of the fluorescent lines due to the ( 1 - 2)p(5 ) transition in several offset spectra .",
    "the fluxes are measured above the estimated continuum .",
    "the last column shows the ratios of the line fluxes at @xmath16 and @xmath17  , where the fluxes have been corrected for reddening with a@xmath18=2.2 using the hd29647 extinction law @xcite .",
    "the ratios are consistent with the optically thin ratio ( 0.73 ) , within the uncertainties given by their low s / n .",
    "to make the line identifications shown in figure 2 , it is necessary to impose wavelength shifts to the spectra of the extended emission .",
    "if these shifts were interpreted as velocities , they would require motions of @xmath6 2000 km s@xmath19 or more , much larger than the velocities previously reported in the region ( @xmath6 45 km s@xmath19 ; @xcite .",
    "a more likely explanation for the wavelength shifts is that they are due to spatial shifts of the emission regions relative to the star within the large ( 2 \" ) aperture . in this case",
    ", the wavelength shift @xmath20 would imply a displacement @xmath21 from the axis of the slit , where @xmath22 is the plate scale and @xmath23 is the dispersion .",
    "all the offsets are measured from the position of t tau n.    figure 2 indicates at the right the offsets @xmath24 required to fit the h@xmath1 lines at each @xmath25 offset from the star .",
    "two spatially - distinct regions of h@xmath1 emission can be identified .",
    "one region extending to @xmath26 `` southwest from the star , which is shifted slightly westwards , and a region covering @xmath27 from the star , which has an eastward displacement .",
    "these regions can be discerned in figure 1 .",
    "the northern region , labeled by n in the sketch below the spectrum in figure 1 , can be seen as three features extending to a distance of about 0.7 '' southward from the star , at pa @xmath28 , corresponding to the h@xmath1 line pairs at 1490/1505  , 1431/1446  , and 1547/1562  , although in the latter case the structure near the star is difficult to see due to the strong stellar c iv 1550  emission .",
    "further south , these emission features seem to disappear ; however , similar pairs of emission lines can be seen shifted roughly 25  blueward , extending nearly vertically in the image to about 1.6 \" south .",
    "this region of emission is labeled s in figure 1 .",
    "the n region extends to the north of the star as well , but it is difficult to identify spectral features in it . after taking into account the position angle of the slit , we find that the spatial location of the upper n emission region appears to correspond to the the brightest part of the southern optical scattered light structure imaged by s98 , while the lower emission region roughly follows the outer border of the scattered light nebula , although displaced from it .    to obtain more information about the spatial distribution of the emission , we constructed a model and compare the predicted emission with the observed spectrum .",
    "if the spatial distribution of the emission at a given offset @xmath25 is given by _",
    "w(x , y ) _ , and the intrinsic emission at each point is @xmath29 , then the observed flux at wavelength @xmath30 is given by the convolution of _",
    "w(x , y ) _ and @xmath31 , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a scaling constant , _",
    "x(i ) _ is the spatial shift across the slit from its axis , @xmath34 is the wavelength shift corresponding to @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the number of pixels across the slit .",
    "we used as template @xmath29 the spectrum of hh 43 , a low - excitation herbig - haro object , which clearly shows the fluorescent lines we have identified @xcite .",
    "the spectrum is an average of the three iue large aperture spectra with the highest exposure times , swp31828 , swp23881 , and swp24924 , taken from the multimission archive at the space telescope science institute , which have been processed under the newsips extraction pipeline .",
    "the combined signal to noise of the resultant hh spectrum is 8 - 13 .",
    "since we are interested in the relative distribution of the h@xmath1 intensity , we normalized @xmath37 to 1 and scaled @xmath29 with the constant _ a _ to fit the observed spectrum of the extended emission at offset @xmath25 = -0.39 \" .",
    "the predicted spectra at several offsets @xmath25 from the star are shown in figure 3 compared to the observed spectra smoothed to the iue resolution of 6  ; the corresponding spatial map of the emission @xmath37 is shown in figure 4 .",
    "the h@xmath1 emission in the southern part of region n ( n1 in figure 4 ) appears to follow the brightness and spatial distribution of the scattered light image of s98 , with some indication that the h@xmath1 is somehow spatially more concentrated than the optical region .",
    "the h@xmath1 and optical emission are similar from @xmath6 0.``45 to @xmath6 0.''65 from the star , but around @xmath6 0.\"45 , the h@xmath1 emission is @xmath6 30% narrower than the optical scattered light .",
    "consistently , the h@xmath1 emission in the northern part of region n ( n2 in figure 4 ) is low , since the north part of the optical emission is two magnitudes fainter than the southern portion at the same distance from t tau n ( s98 ) .",
    "the resulting predicted spectra for region n1 are shown at -0.39 `` and -0.62 '' offsets in figure 3 .",
    "the spectral agreement is reasonable considering the low s / n of the spectra and the contamination by stellar emission at -0.39 \" .",
    "the principal failing of the model is the lack of predicted emission near 1600 - 1620  , which is identified in the spectrum of t tau n as a mix of cii an fe ii by valenti et al .",
    "fe ii emission may arise from the @xmath640 @xmath38 j - shocks discussed below as sources of lyman @xmath2 photons for the lower emission region .",
    "it is also likely that the broad lyman @xmath2 emission profile of t tau produces some of the fluorescent sequences observed in mira @xcite but not in low excitation hh objects .",
    "some of these sequences include emission near 1610  .    for region",
    "s , @xmath39 , the observed line profiles are too narrow to resolve the emitting regions ; we found the best fits by introducing two narrow structures at slightly different positions , labeled s1 and s2 in figure 4 . the agreement between predicted and observed spectra in figure 3 is reasonably satisfactory except for a feature near 1600 - 1620  in the @xmath40 offset spectrum . we should also emphasize again that it would be difficult for us to detect",

    "( [ flujo1 ] ) , we can write for the luminosity of the stellar lyman @xmath2 line @xmath83 where the limits arise from the uncertainty in the reddening correction appropiate to the h@xmath1 lines , since the extinction along the line of sight of the nebulosity may not be the same as the extinction of the star ; the lower limit comes from taking the observed h@xmath1 flux and the upper limit from dereddening this flux by the extinction to t tau n , @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "in addition , as discussed above , the actual value of @xmath82 is likely to be higher because of projection effects , making the required lyman @xmath2 luminosity lower than estimates in eq.([lyalimits ] ) .",
    "these limits for the lyman @xmath2 luminosity are consistent with those obtained by scaling by a factor of 30 the dereddened flux of the civ 1548 line in our stellar spectra , as suggested by ardila et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . with f@xmath85 @xmath86",

    "the estimated maximum lyman @xmath2 luminosity ( eq . [ [ lyalimits ] ] ) is @xmath88 60 % of the accretion luminosity of t tau n estimated from the nuv spectrum obtained simultaneously with the fuv spectrum , @xmath89 @xcite , so it can be accounted for by accretion energy .",
    "we thus conclude that the h@xmath1 emission in region n is consistent with stellar lyman @xmath2 pumping .",
    "while the bright rims seen in region n are clearly illuminated by t tau n , the southern arcs s1 and s2 appear to be located ( in projection ) well inside the envelope , roughly tracing the outer edge of the extended emission of s98 .",
    "lyman @xmath2 from the visible star will be absorbed by dust in the envelope so it can not penetrate more than one dust mean free path , @xmath90 au , estimated from models of infalling envelopes @xcite with typical envelope parameters from @xcite ( @xmath91 ) and a dust opacity at the lyman @xmath2 wavelength of 1538 cm@xmath43 g@xmath19 @xcite .",
    "it is therefore more likely that the required lyman @xmath2 emission comes from the shocks themselves , as in the case of low excitation hh objects @xcite .",
    "if lyman @xmath2 is locally produced , then @xmath92 , so we can write @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the h@xmath1 luminosity . using similar values of @xmath82 and @xmath75 as in region n , we get that the luminosity in lyman @xmath2 required to excite the h@xmath1 fluorescence in region s is @xmath95 where again , the lower limit is given by the observed values of the h@xmath1 flux , and the upper limit by assuming that the extinction is the same as towards t tau n , although there is no argument to support the assumption of an homogeneous extinction in the whole region .",
    "these limits are consistent with values of the lyman @xmath2 luminosity in low excitation hh objects ; for instance , @xcite find @xmath96 in hh 47a .",
    "fluorescence requires a significant population in excited levels which also can lead to infrared h@xmath1 emission lines .",
    "thus , the observed upper limits to the infrared emission line fluxes in observations covering region n @xcite can provide an additional constraint on molecular column densities .",
    "an upper limit for the 2.12 @xmath10 m h@xmath1 line can be estimated from the equivalent width of 0.15  , which is the detection threshold for features in the @xcite observations . using the continuum flux of @xmath97",
    ", we obtain that the flux at the 2.12 @xmath10 m h@xmath1 line needed for a 2 @xmath98 detection would be @xmath99 @xmath100 .",
    "the flux at 2.12 @xmath10 m h@xmath1 in the optically thin limit is given by @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the column density of the upper level of the transition .",
    "with the einstein value @xmath103 @xcite and the upper limit for the flux , we obtain @xmath104 .",
    "as mentioned before , we have only a lower limit to the actual n(2,5 ) . with this lower limit and the upper limit for n(1,3 ) ,",
    "we can obtain a lower limit to the excitation temperature in region n through the boltzmann relation @xmath105 , with @xmath106 @xcite .",

    "region n appears to be aligned along the bright rims of the reflection nebulosity around t tau n ,  [ espacial ] ; which was plausibly interpreted by s98 as the walls of a cavity driven into the surrounding medium by the outflow from this star .",
    "the h@xmath1 emission requires some heating to excite molecules into the level which can fluoresce with lyman @xmath2 . at distances of @xmath116 au where the fluorescent emission is observed , local dust temperatures resulting from heating by the central star(s )",
    "are predicted to be @xmath117  k @xcite , whereas excitation temperatures must be @xmath118  k by the argument of the previous section .",
    "the most likely explanation is that shock heating is responsible for the excitation of h@xmath1 in these regions , as also suggested by the consistency of the observed spectrum with that of a low - excitation herbig - haro object (  [ espacial ] ) .",
    "the impact of the wind emanating from t tau n on the molecular medium can naturally explain the needed excitation of h@xmath1 , and it has already being suggested as a possible explanation for the near infrared h@xmath1 bright rims that seem to coincide with the scattered light image at larger scales @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that the e - w outflow is a highly collimated , high velocity @xmath6 200 @xmath119 jet at 0.3 \" @xmath6 40 au from the star from analysis of the forbidden line emission .",
    "alternatively , as proposed previously by @xcite , @xcite , and more recently by @xcite , the jet results from a density enhancement along the outflow axis in a wide - angle wind .",
    "our observations support the second hypothesis in that a wide - angle wind is required to produce the excitation along the walls of the cavity .",
    "moreover , we expect that an oblique shock would be formed at the interaction of the wide - angle wind and the molecular environment , as envisoned by @xcite .",
    "only the normal component of the velocity would be thermalized , reducing the effective pre - shock velocity .",
    "the velocities required to produce a low excitation spectrum as that emitted along the cavity (  [ espacial ] ) are @xmath88 60 km s@xmath19 @xcite ; higher velocities would result in high ionization uv lines , such as civ and si iv , which are clearly absent in our data .",
    "thus , the observed h@xmath1 fluorescent emission at the cavity walls may be the clearest ( though indirect ) evidence to date for the presence of low - density , wide - opening - angle outflows driving cavities into the molecular medium in star - forming regions .",
    "observations of other shock - excited features close to t tau n are needed to help constrain wide - angle wind properties .",
    "the double arcs of region s are located as close as 0\".3 ( 49 au ) to t tau s. the shape and orientation of this double arc are very similar to the arcs of h@xmath1 2.12 @xmath5 and optical forbidden line emission described by @xcite , interpreted as terminal shocks of h@xmath1 , [ s ii ] and [ fe ii ] @xcite in the n - s outflow .",
    "figure 4b shows an enlarged view of the region around the t tau system , indicating the positions of regions n and s and the shocked structures described by @xcite , as well as the scattered light image of s98 .",
    "as mentioned in  [ physical ] , the arcs of region s are located inside the region of forbidden line emission labeled d by @xcite , very near the centroid .",
    "the outlines of this region as well as the position of the centroid are indicated in figure 4b .",
    "the mean velocity of region d is v = -44 km s@xmath19 , enough to have a j - shock which could excite the fluorescence as in other low excitation hh objects @xcite . in the case of hh47a ,",
    "@xcite find that 90 % of the uv line emission comes from a postshock distance of @xmath120 13 au , which we could not resolve .",
    "therefore , the coincidence of the h@xmath1 uv emission with the centroid of the [ s ii ] emission of component d in @xcite is to be expected .",
    "more sensitive near - infrared observations to constrain the 2.12 @xmath10 m emission would provide better constraints on column densities in these regions .",
    "we describe the spatial distribution of the h@xmath1 fluorescent emission in the inner 2``x2 '' region around the t tau system . a northern region of emission coincides with the walls of the cavity of the envelope seen in scattered light .",
    "lyman @xmath2 from t tau n appears to be strong enough to excite the fluorescence , but local temperatures @xmath6 1000 k are required to mantain the fluorescence ; shock heating is requred since stellar heating is not sufficient .",
    "the required temperatures and the spectrum of the nebulosity , which resembles that of a low excitation hh object , indicate a low velocity shock .",
    "the shock may be produced by the interaction of a wide - angle wind emanating from t tau n and the molecular material around it .",
    "this represents the clearest evidence for the presence of wide - angle winds at scales @xmath121 100 au from the star .",
    "a southern region of emission consists of two arcs , with shape and orientation similar to the arcs of h@xmath1 2.12 @xmath5 and forbidden line emission crossing the outflow associated with the t tau s system .",
    "the arcs are near the centroid of the forbidden line emission in the blueshifted lobe of the outflow .",
    "the velocity of the outflow around the arcs are consistent with j - shocks , which could power the fluorescence as in low excitation herbig - haro objects .      acknowledgments .",
    "we wish to thank k. stapelfeldt for providing us the optical image of t tau , m. kasper for the infrared images and spectra of t tau n , and k. bhm and j. solf for the original long slit spectrograms of t tau n and its surroundings .",
