    "while the basic mechanism of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is reasonably well in hand , certain aspects of the explicit breaking of chiral symmetry ( @xmath11sb ) , due to nonzero quark masses , remain not fully resolved to date . in the @xmath0-@xmath1 system at low energies the quantities of interest are the chiral symmetry breaking `` sigma term '' and the scattering lengths . in particular , the @xmath2-term has been found to have an unexpectedly large value ( for the most recent comprehensive analysis see ref .",
    "the discrepancy between the @xmath2-term values obtained from the baryon mass splitting and from extrapolation of the isospin - even @xmath0-@xmath1 scattering amplitude has been attributed to a nonzero @xmath12 content of the nucleon @xcite .",
    "@xmath0-@xmath1 scattering lengths are related quantities that provide an independent check of the chiral lagrangians .",
    "thus , low energy @xmath0-@xmath1 interactions have retained a fundamental significance and interest over the years .",
    "unfortunately , inconsistencies in the existing @xmath0-@xmath1 data set have given rise to significant uncertainties of the low energy @xmath0-@xmath1 amplitudes .",
    "these , in turn , are reflected in the error limits of the extracted `` experimental '' value of the @xmath2-term . this situation has led to an effort to remeasure all low energy @xmath0-@xmath1 observables at the remaining meson facilities . in this work",
    "we focus on the charge exchange reaction below 30 mev pion incident energy .",
    "absolute measurements of the pion - nucleon charge exchange reaction @xmath3@xmath4@xmath5 below 50 or even 100 mev are sparse .",
    "the difficulties stem from the requirement that the beam composition , beam flux , and the @xmath13 detection efficiency all have to be measured or determined accurately in an absolute way .",
    "early published data below 50 mev were measured by detecting the neutron at a single angle , 0@xmath7 , corresponding to the @xmath13 angle of 180@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "another set of measurements @xcite used a large nai(tl ) crystal counter to detect single photons from the final state @xmath13 decay , at 27.4 and 39.3 mev incident pion energy , covering a wide angular range . due to the nature of this method ,",
    "yields from a broad range of @xmath13 angles were mixed in at any given laboratory angle of a detected single photon .",
    "hence , the authors could only report a legendre polynomial decomposition of the @xmath3@xmath4@xmath5 angular distribution , up to order 2 .",
    "first published direct measurements of angular distribution data of the @xmath3@xmath4@xmath5 reaction below 50 mev were made using the lampf @xmath13 spectrometer @xcite at seven energies between 32.5 and 63.5 mev for @xmath14 @xcite . a device such as the @xmath13 spectrometer detects the two photons following the @xmath13 decay in coincidence .",
    "this , in turn , enables a full reconstruction of the neutral pion s momentum four - vector . in our work",
    "we used the same technique .",
    "the present measurements of the differential cross sections for the reaction @xmath3@xmath4@xmath5 at @xmath15 mev were carried out in the lep secondary beam channel at the clinton p. anderson meson physics facility ( lampf ) in los alamos .",
    "we used a weakly focusing 30 mev @xmath16 beam tune with 12 mr divergence ( both horizontal and vertical ) , a beam spot size of 9 mm fwhm , momentum spread @xmath17% and pion flux averaging @xmath18  @xmath16/sec .",
    "relative on - target beam intensity was monitored with a sealed ion gas chamber in combination with a high precision charge integrator .",
    "absolute cross - calibration of chamber ionization counts was obtained through activation measurements of the @xmath19c(@xmath20c reaction using cylindrical plastic scintillator targets @xcite .",
    "the @xmath21c activation measurements were reproducible to better than @xmath22% , while the @xmath21c activation cross section used for normalization has an uncertainty of 4.7% @xcite .",
    "the electron and muon contaminations in the beam were determined by a combination of direct measurement and constraints using the integrated energy deposited in the sealed ion chamber that was calibrated in absolute terms independently .",
    "the associated uncertainty of the pion flux amounted to @xmath23% .",
    "our measurements were carried out using a @xmath24 mg/@xmath25 polyethylene ( ch@xmath26 ) target , with a suitable @xmath19c target for background subtraction .",
    "in addition , we recorded charge exchange data using a @xmath27 mg/@xmath25 liquid hydrogen target as a check .",
    "we used the lampf @xmath13 spectrometer to detect coincident photons following @xmath13 decay in @xmath3@xmath4@xmath5 .",
    "the spectrometer multiwire proportional chamber and veto counter efficiencies were calibrated independently using cosmic muons .",
    "all tracking efficiencies were also evaluated from data and compared with a detailed simulation using geant @xcite .",
    "the resulting uncertainty of the integral @xmath13 detection efficiency was 4.6% .",
    "the measured detector response to @xmath13 s from the charge exchange reaction under study was compared to simulations using geant and piang @xcite , with excellent agreement .",
    "the rms angular resolution of the spectrometer was 2@xmath7 .",
    "results of our measurements of the @xmath3@xmath4@xmath5 angular distribution between 0@xmath7 and 55@xmath7 ( c.m . ) , binned into @xmath28 wide bins , are plotted in fig .",
    "[ f : ang - dist ] as full circles .",
    "error bars shown in the figure reflect only statistical uncertainties ; in addition , an overall normalization uncertainty of 7.5% applies to the data , as discussed above .    for the sake of comparison we have also included in fig .",
    "[ f : ang - dist ] the angular distribution predicted by the comprehensive @xmath0-@xmath1 phase shift analysis sm95 by the vpi group @xcite ( solid curve ) .",
    "the agreement between our data and the vpi phase shift prediction is excellent .",
    "older data at this energy from ref .",
    "@xcite are available only in the form of a legendre polynomial decomposition ( fit ) of the angular distribution .",
    "that fit is represented in fig .",
    "[ f : ang - dist ] by a dashed line , while dotted lines denote the associated error limits .",
    "-12 mm    [ f : ang - dist ]    -5 mm    in summary , our results provide a new stringent constraint on the low energy @xmath0-@xmath1 phase shifts , and are in excellent agreement with the existing body of @xmath0-@xmath1 data .",
    "low energy @xmath0-@xmath0 scattering has enjoyed longstanding attention as a window into the mechanism of chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "pion - pion scattering lengths have recently come sharply into focus due to the controversy regarding @xmath30 , the scalar quark condensate , and the two radically different and far - reaching scenarios of @xmath11sb @xcite .",
    "the current most reliable value of @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 ) , extracted mainly from @xmath33 decay data @xcite , is not accurate enough to make the required distinction .",
    "we report here on preliminary results of a chew - low analysis  @xcite of exclusive @xmath34 data measured at 260 mev @xmath35 incident energy .",
    "the experimental apparatus and the total cross section analysis are described in ref .",
    "the chew - low method evaluates @xmath36 cross sections by extrapolating to the pion pole the function @xmath37 : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the dipion invariant mass , @xmath40 is the squared 4-momentum transfer to the proton , @xmath41 is the total c.m .",
    "energy , @xmath42 is the incident pion momentum , and @xmath43 the pion decay constant . in this work , we had to perform a deconvolution of the instrumental resolution function from the data before we could construct an interpretable @xmath37 .",
    "preliminary values of @xmath44 , the chew - low extrapolation function , calculated from our @xmath10 data at 260 mev are plotted against @xmath40 in fig .",
    "[ f : chew - low ] , alongside a linear fit .",
    "points with @xmath45 were excluded from the fit due to the diminishing contribution of the one pion exchange process ; the lowest @xmath40 point was excluded due to deconvolution uncertainties .          using the new @xmath46 cross section datum we can deduce @xmath47 .",
    "however , further work is required in order to extract a more reliable extrapolated value of @xmath48 .",
    "that result , in turn , will be added to the existing @xmath36 data set for a comprehensive dispersion - relation analysis ."
