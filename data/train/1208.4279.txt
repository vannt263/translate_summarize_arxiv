    "the moduli space of pairs @xmath0 with @xmath1 a complex connected smooth projective curve of genus @xmath2 and @xmath3 a nonzero abelian differential on @xmath1 , and denoted here by @xmath4 , comes with the structure of a deligne - mumford stack , but we will just regard it as an orbifold . the forgetful morphism @xmath5 exhibits @xmath4 as the complement of the zero section of the hodge bundle over @xmath6 . a partition of @xmath4 into suborbifolds is defined by looking at the multiplicities of the zeros of the abelian differential : for any numerical partition @xmath7 of @xmath8 , we have a subvariety @xmath9 which parameterizes the pairs @xmath0 for which the zero divisor @xmath10 of @xmath3 is of type @xmath11 .",
    "we call a _ stratum _ of @xmath4 a connected component of some @xmath12 ( nb : our terminology differs from that of @xcite )",
    ".      kontsevich and zorich @xcite characterized the strata of @xmath4 in rather simple terms .",
    "first consider the case when @xmath1 is hyperelliptic .",
    "then an effective divisor of degree @xmath8 on @xmath1 is canonical if and only if it is invariant under the hyperelliptic involution .",
    "so the type @xmath11 of such a divisor has the property that any odd integer appears in it an even number of times .",
    "there are two cases where the support of the canonical divisor is an orbit of the hyperelliptic involution : one is of type @xmath13 and the other is of type @xmath14 ( the two cases corresponding to a weierstra  point resp .   a pair of points ) .",
    "the authors show that these make up strata and denote them by @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively .",
    "notice that this fully covers the case @xmath17 .",
    "they show that for @xmath18 , @xmath19 is a stratum unless @xmath20 and all the terms of @xmath11 are even . in that case",
    "the canonical divisor is twice the divisor of an ( effective ) theta characteristic , which for @xmath20 can be even or odd ( for @xmath21 it is necessarily odd , as there is no effective even theta characteristic ) .",
    "these loci are connected and hence define strata : @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "this completes the kontsevich - zorich characterization of the strata .",
    "each stratum is known to have a ` linear ' structure : it comes with an atlas of holomorphic charts whose transition maps lie in @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the dimension of the stratum .",
    "a chart of this atlas at @xmath0 is defined as follows .",
    "note that @xmath3 defines an element @xmath26\\in h^1(c , z_\\ab;\\cc)$ ] , where @xmath10 denotes the zero locus consisting of @xmath27 distinct points .",
    "if we put @xmath28 and choose an isomorphism @xmath29 , then varying @xmath0 in a small neighborhood in its stratum makes the image of @xmath26 $ ] vary in @xmath30 .",
    "this yields a @xmath30-valued chart .",
    "in particular @xmath31 .",
    "since every connected stratum @xmath32 of @xmath4 is invariant under scalar multiplication it defines a suborbifold @xmath33 in the @xmath34-orbifold bundle @xmath35 over @xmath6 . such a projectivized stratum parameterizes pairs @xmath36 with @xmath1 a smooth projective curve and @xmath37 a positive canonical divisor on @xmath1 with prescribed multiplicities .",
    "moreover , @xmath32 has a contractible orbifold universal cover if and only if @xmath33 has : in this case , the orbifold fundamental group of @xmath33 is the quotient of the orbifold fundamental group of @xmath32 by an infinite cyclic central subgroup .",
    "the somewhat technical price to pay for working with @xmath33 is that over the hyperelliptic locus we have to deal with @xmath38-gerbes .",
    "since @xmath32 has a linear structure , @xmath39 has a projective structure ( i.e. , it has a holomorphic atlas which takes values in @xmath40 such that the transition maps lie in a projective linear group ) .",
    "the topology of the hyperelliptic strata is familiar and although a bit subtle , essentially well understood . consider an affine plane curve @xmath41 with equation @xmath42 where the @xmath43 s are pairwise distinct .",
    "a projective curve @xmath44 is obtained by adding a point @xmath45 at infinity and @xmath46 extends over @xmath44 as an abelian differential @xmath47 with a unique zero at infinity .",
    "notice that @xmath47 naturally defines a nonzero element in @xmath48 .    performing the above construction in families over @xmath49",
    "we obtain a diagram @xmath50^f & \\ccal^\\circ\\ar@{_(->}[l]\\ar@{^(->}[r ] & \\rcal_{2g+1}\\times \\aa^2 \\ar[lld ] \\\\",
    "\\rcal_{2g+1 } \\ar@/^1pc/[u]^\\sigma } \\ ] ] where @xmath51 is a smooth projective curve with a section @xmath52 .",
    "moreover , we also obtain a @xmath53 that vanishes along the image of @xmath52 of order @xmath8 and so a nowhere - zero section of @xmath54 over @xmath55 .",

    "notice that @xmath61 yields the hyperelliptic involution .",
    "the induced action on @xmath62 is @xmath63 , and so @xmath64 is isomorphic to @xmath65 if and only if @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "moreover , the action of @xmath68 on @xmath55 that permutes the components of @xmath69 commutes with the @xmath56-action and so we obtain an isomorphism of orbifolds @xmath70^{\\qquad\\sim } & & \\hcal^{hyp}(2g-2 ) } \\ ] ] now , @xmath71 is a classifying space for the braid group @xmath72 on @xmath73 strands .",
    "hence @xmath74 is an orbifold classifying space for a group that is an extension of @xmath75 by @xmath72 .",
    "if we are interested in projective classes of abelian differentials , then we obtain @xmath76^{\\qquad\\qquad\\sim } & & \\pp\\hcal^{hyp}(2g-2 ) } \\ ] ] and so @xmath77 has a contractible orbifold universal cover and its orbifold fundamental group is a hyperelliptic mapping class group , namely the centralizer in the mapping class group of a hyperelliptic involution @xmath78 of a pointed genus @xmath79 surface ( which preserves the point ) and that the orbifold universal cover is contractible .    similarly for @xmath80 , we consider affine plane curves @xmath81 of equation @xmath82 together with the differential @xmath83 . if @xmath44 is the smooth completion of @xmath81 obtained by adding the points at infinity @xmath84 and @xmath85 , then @xmath47 naturally determines a nonzero element in @xmath86 .    implementing the above construction in families",
    "yields a smooth curve @xmath87 together with a divisor @xmath88 that projects tale @xmath89 onto @xmath90 , a @xmath91 that vanishes of order @xmath92 along @xmath88 and a nowhere - zero section of @xmath93 .",
    "a @xmath56-action can be defined on @xmath94 as @xmath95 and the induced action on @xmath62 is @xmath96 .",
    "we also have the obvious action of @xmath97 in this family ( which just permutes the @xmath43 s ) and the involution @xmath78 which sends @xmath98 to @xmath99 .",
    "these three actions commute , so that we have one of @xmath100 .",
    "the stabilizer of @xmath101 is @xmath102 and it is easy to see that any isomorphism @xmath103 is the restriction of an element of this stabilizer .",
    "so we obtain the isomorphism of orbifolds @xmath104^{\\quad\\sim } & & \\hcal^{hyp}(g-1,g-1 ) } \\ ] ] this makes @xmath80 an orbifold classifying space of an extension of @xmath105 by @xmath106 .",
    "it also shows that the orbifold fundamental group of @xmath107 is just a hyperelliptic mapping class group ( to be precise , it is the centralizer in the full mapping class group of a hyperelliptic involution of a twice pointed genus @xmath79 surface which exchanges the points ) and that the orbifold universal cover is contractible .    in their preprint @xcite kontsevich and zorich conjecture that something similar is true in general , namely that each projectivized stratum always has a contractible orbifold universal cover and that its orbifold fundamental group is commensurable with some mapping class group .      in this paper",
    "we give rather precise descriptions of all the strata in genus 3 .",
    "this enables us to find a presentation of their orbifold fundamental group , at least in principle : we do this for all the strata , except for the open stratum @xmath108 , where it gets unwieldy , and to make for these strata the kontsevich - zorich conjecture so explicit that it acquires more of a topological flavor .",
    "concretely , we show that the nonhyperelliptic strata in genus 3 can be understood as parameterizing del pezzo surfaces of degree two or one endowed with an anticanonical divisor of a given type and describe these in turn in terms of combinatorial ( root ) data .",
    "such moduli spaces have been investigated by one of us before .",
    "it turns out that they can be given in a somewhat similar spirit as the hyperelliptic strata : some orbifold cover appears as the complement of a locally finite arrangement in a domain and the in principle their fundamental group can be computed .",
    "for instance , for @xmath109 resp .",
    "@xmath110 we get the discriminant complement of the root system of type @xmath111 resp .",
    "its fundamental group is the artin group of that type and a highly nontrivial theorem of deligne @xcite asserts that this complement has indeed a contractible universal cover .",
    "but in the other cases this seems difficult to establish .",
    "questions of that kind are reminiscent , and indeed overlap , with the arnold - thom conjecture which states that the discriminant complement of the universal deformation of an an isolated hypersurface singularity is a @xmath113 .",
    "they are still the subject of current research @xcite .",
    "we do not know how to make the commensurability conjecture of kontsevich and zorich precise .",
    "our results seem to indicate that the open stratum @xmath114 has an orbifold fundamental group which may _ not _ be commensurable with a central extension of the mapping class group of the punctured genus 3 curve .",
    "in fact , for none of the strata described here , we were able to characterize their orbifold fundamental group as a kind of a mapping class group .",

    "let @xmath1 be a nonhyperelliptic nonsingular curve of genus @xmath115 .",
    "the canonical system on @xmath1 embeds in a projective plane @xmath116 .",
    "a double cover @xmath117 of this plane which totally ramifies over @xmath1 is unique up to the obvious involution .",
    "the covering variety @xmath118 is a del pezzo surface of degree 2 , which here amounts to saying that the anticanonical system on @xmath118 is ample and is given by the morphism @xmath119 : any effective anticanonical divisor on @xmath118 is the pull - back of a line in @xmath116 .",
    "every effective anticanonical divisor on @xmath118 has arithmetic genus one ( this is also clear from the way we defined @xmath118 ) .",
    "if @xmath120 is a double tangent of @xmath1 , then its preimage in @xmath118 consists of two exceptional curves ( an _ exceptional curve _ is a smooth genus zero curve with self - intersection @xmath121 ) which intersect each other with intersection number @xmath122 .",
    "since there are 28 bitangents we get @xmath123 exceptional curves and these are in fact all of them .",
    "if we select @xmath124 such exceptional curves that are pairwise disjoint , then their contraction yields a copy of @xmath125 and the anticanonical system is then realized as the system of cubics passing through the 7 image points of this @xmath125 .",
    "there are however many ways of picking 7 pairwise disjoint copies and the best way to come to terms with this is to invoke an associated symmetry group , which is a weyl group of type @xmath111 .",
    "let us make this precise .",
    "the natural map @xmath126 is an isomorphism .",
    "the latter is free of rank 8 and its intersection pairing can be diagonalized with on the diagonal a @xmath127 followed by seven @xmath121 s . if @xmath128 stands for the anticanonical class , then it is clear that @xmath129 .",
    "so the orthogonal complement of @xmath130 in @xmath131 , denoted here by @xmath132 , is negative definite .",
    "a _ root _ is an element @xmath133 with @xmath134 .",
    "associated to a root @xmath135 is a reflection @xmath136 in @xmath131 , given by @xmath137 , which fixes @xmath130 and preserves the intersection pairing .",
    "these reflections generate a weyl group @xmath138 of type @xmath111 so that the roots make up a root system @xmath139 of the same type .",
    "it is known that the classes of the exceptional curves generate @xmath131 and that the roots generate @xmath132 .",
    "a root can be represented by the difference of two disjoint exceptional curves , although not uniquely so .",
    "the weyl group @xmath138 is the full stabilizer of @xmath130 in the orthogonal group of @xmath131 .",
    "the involution of @xmath118 preserves @xmath130 and acts as minus the identity in @xmath132 , hence appears here as the central element of @xmath138 .",
    "but the other nontrivial elements of @xmath138 are usually not induced by an automorphism of @xmath118 .",
    "let @xmath37 be a positive canonical divisor on @xmath1 .",
    "then @xmath37 is the trace of a line @xmath140 on @xmath1 and @xmath141 is an anticanonical divisor on @xmath118 .",
    "as we noted , the latter is of arithmetic genus one : if @xmath37 is general ( of type @xmath142 ) , then @xmath143 is smooth and in the other cases @xmath143 is a nodal curve ( @xmath37 is of type @xmath144 ) , a bigon ( type @xmath145 in the kodaira classification and @xmath37 is of type @xmath146 ) , a cuspidal curve ( type @xmath147 in the kodaira classification and @xmath37 is of type @xmath148 ) or two smooth rational curves meeting in a point with multiplicity 2 ( type @xmath149 in the kodaira classification and @xmath37 is of type @xmath150 ) . we regard @xmath143 as a genus one curve endowed with a polarization of degree 2 .",
    "the group @xmath151 of isomorphism classes of line bundles on @xmath143 has as its identity component @xmath152 an elliptic curve , is isomorphic to @xmath153 or is the additive group @xmath154 , according to whether @xmath37 is reduced , has a point of multiplicity @xmath122 , or has a point of multiplicity @xmath155 .",
    "the orthogonal complement in @xmath131 of the classes of the irreducible components of @xmath143 , denoted here by @xmath156 , is generated by the roots contained in it , so that these roots make up a root subsystem @xmath157 .",
    "we have only two cases : for @xmath143 irreducible , we have of course @xmath158 and otherwise ( when @xmath143 has two irreducible components interchanged by @xmath159 ) , @xmath160 is of type @xmath112 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the natural homomorphism @xmath161 has an evident restriction @xmath162 it plays a central role in what follows .",

    "its isomorphism type is a complete invariant of the pair @xmath174 ( and hence of the pair @xmath36 ) . to be more concrete ,",
    "let us identify @xmath175 with a fixed root system @xmath176 of type @xmath112 or @xmath111 .",
    "two such identifications differ by an element of the automorphism group @xmath177 of @xmath176 , which is @xmath178 in the @xmath112 case and @xmath179 in the @xmath111 case .",

    "notice that @xmath181 equals @xmath182 for @xmath180 a generic elliptic curve or @xmath183 and is equal to @xmath173 when @xmath184 .",
    "so if we denote by @xmath185 the ( root ) lattice spanned by @xmath176 , and by @xmath186 homomorphisms with no root in their kernel , then our @xmath164 defines an element of @xmath187 for @xmath176 and @xmath180 as listed .",
    "this construction also makes sense for families of elliptic curves .",
