    "the cleanest signature at no@xmath0a will be from @xmath2 cc events producing upward - going muons that can be reconstructed in the no@xmath0a detector .",
    "the large and unique no@xmath0a far detector , with its excellent granularity and energy resolution , and relatively low - energy neutrino thresholds , is an ideal tool for these indirect dark matter searches .    at no@xmath0a , the neutrino analyses simply store events synchronous with the numi beam . for non - beam exotic physics searches , so - called data - driven triggers  @xcite are required to select events of interest .    only the upward - going flux will be considered in order to suppress the cosmic - ray background .",
    "the downward - going muon rate in the no@xmath0a far detector is approximately 100,000 hz .",
    "we expect to keep the upward - going muon trigger rate to about 10 hz or less , so a rejection of at least four orders of magnitude is required by the trigger .",
    "of course , this rejection must be accomplished while keeping the acceptance for upward - going muons relatively high .",
    "the neutrino flux from dark matter annihilation is model dependent ; however , energies from @xmath30.5gev to many tev should be detected with high acceptance . for high - mass signal hypothesis",
    ", no@xmath0a will not be able to compete with the high acceptance of the icecube detector  @xcite .",
    "for lower - mass scenarios ( below @xmath320 gev ) the super - kamiokande experiment currently has the best sensitivity  @xcite .",
    "if an efficient upward - going muon trigger and sufficient cosmic ray background rejection can be achieved , no@xmath0a will be competitive with super ",
    "kamiokande for wimp mass hypotheses below 20 gev / c@xmath4 .",
    "one advantage that no@xmath0a has compared to past experiments that performed similar searches for dark matter annihilation is the relatively low energy threshold for muons .",
    "a 1 gev muon track travels approximately 5 meters in the no@xmath0a detector resulting in an energy threshold well below 1 gev .",
    "the challenge for the dark matter search is triggering efficiently on these low - energy muons . for shorter track lengths",
    ", the timing information will not be as powerful for rejecting downward - going backgrounds . using stopping or fully - contained events and using the top and sides of the detector to veto downward - going events can provide an additional two orders of magnitude rejection .",
    "in this note we focus on using the timing information from all of the hits on a track to reject the downward - going muon background and efficiently select upward - going events .",
    "a trigger for upward - going muons based on timing information required a minor upgrade to the readout of the no@xmath0a far detector .",
    "this upgrade to the so - called `` multipoint '' readout occurred on september 11 , 2014 , and resulted immediately in a single - hit timing resolution of about 25 ns ( note that the timing resolution with the previous algorithm was about 125 ns , so this is a significant improvement ) . with dozens of hits per track ,",
    "it is possible to reject downward - going muons by many orders of magnitude using hit timing information alone .    to resolve the directionality of the muon track , the upward - going muon trigger takes advantage of the timing information from each individual hit in the reconstructed tracks .",
    "the tracks are reconstructed using the hough transform algorithm , and are required to match in both xz and yz views .",
    "we start from the hit with lowest @xmath5 cell value , @xmath6 , in the track in the yz view .",
    "the measured time of the corresponding hit is defined as @xmath7 .",
    "the observed and expected time of each hit on the track in the yz view is therefore :    @xmath8    similarly , for the xz view :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the cell numbers in xz and yz view , and @xmath12 is the time measurement in tdc units , which is converted to ns using the factor of 15.625 ns / tdc .",
    "@xmath13 is the time - of - flight of the muon track defined as :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is track length in cm , and 29.97cm / ns is the expected speed assuming that the muon is relativistic .",
    "since we require that each track is reconstructed and matched in both views , ( @xmath16 ; @xmath6 ) and ( @xmath17 ; @xmath18 ) must correspond to the lowest and highest points of the track respectively .",
    "in addition , we can estimate the missing coordinate for a particular hit in either view using 3d requirement .",
    "for the yz view , track coordinates can be calculated as such :    @xmath19    similarly , for the xz view :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 cm and @xmath22 cm are the widths of detector cells and planes . the cell and plane with id=0",
    "have coordinates @xmath23 cm and @xmath24 cm .",
    "since for each hit in each view we can estimate ( x ; y ; z ) coordinates , we can calculate the distance from the hit to the apd readout end .",
    "the further the hit is located from the readout the longer it takes for the light to propagate and be detected by the apd .",
    "we are interested in the hit time of the muon passing through the extrusion , so we have to correct for the light propagation time in the fiber .",
    "the speed of light in the fiber is measured to be 15.3 cm / ns .",
    "the light level in each channel in the no@xmath0a detector is independently sampled every 500 ns . the electronic response to an incident particle depositing energy in a cell can be parameterized in terms of two intrinsic timing values ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) , the number of photoelectrons ( @xmath27 ) , and a timing `` offset '' ( @xmath28 ) , or the elapsed time between a read - out and the time of incidence of the particle :    @xmath29    here , @xmath30 is a proportionality factor that does not affect the timing fit .",
    "the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 correspond to the intrinsic falling and rising time of the response curve , respectively . as such , they are approximately known . for the purpose of determining hit timing ,",
    "the parameter of note is @xmath28 . by performing a simple @xmath31 minimization ,",
    "the data - preferred value of @xmath28 can be extracted from multiple readouts on a single channel . for the purposes of the trigger , where hit processing time must be minimized , fit results were pre - calculated and tabulated such that the computationally expensive minimization need not be repeated for each individual hit .",

    "@xcite for more details.,width=576 ]    each time measurement has an uncertainty , which varies with the amount of energy deposited .",
    "the time uncertainty on a given hit from a reconstructed muon track affects the determination of track directionality , so a parameterization of uncertainty in terms of energy deposition is necessary for the timing - based trigger .",
    "single - hit time resolution is plotted against energy deposition in fig .",

    "[ fig : disc_llr ] . from this distribution ,",
    "it is clear that a cut on llr slightly above zero will reduce the cosmic background by the desired amount while preserving a high signal acceptance .",
    "note that the wimpsim sample used is for dark matter with a 20 gev mass annihilating through the @xmath36 channel .",
    "as such the neutrinos from the b - meson decay produce muons which , on average , have a much lower energy compared to the cosmic ray muons .",
    "this explains why the llr for the signal has a larger component close to zero than the cosmic sample .",
    "the llr yields better performance for cosmic background rejection for the same signal acceptance in the regime where the cosmic rejection is sufficient ( at least four orders of magnitude ) , compared to a cut on the best - fit slope .",
    "for example , for a signal acceptance of 0.7 the background rejection is about a factor of three better for the llr . at this point",
    "the mc predicts background rejection of close to five orders of magnitude .",
    "in addition to being a more powerful discriminator as observed in the mc studies , the llr estimator is more robust to mis - reconstructed tracks which will be an important feature in real data .",
    "since mis - reconstructions will result in time distributions that follow neither the upward- nor the downward - going hypothesis , the result of mis - reconstruction will yield llr values close to `` 0 '' , and not values consistent with a high - probability for being upward - going .",
