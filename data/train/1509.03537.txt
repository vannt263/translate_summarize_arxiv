    "distribution of entanglement over long distances is one of the main challenges of quantum information @xcite . for quantum communication or distributed quantum computing ,",
    "one of the main pillars is the implementation of quantum memories .",
    "indeed , such a device could serve as a light - matter interface between computing nodes and channels of communication @xcite , moreover it is an essential building block of quantum repeaters @xcite .",
    "these memories need to be efficient , multimode , long - lived and have high fidelities @xcite .",
    "+ for information technology , a multimode capacity of communication channels presents the obvious advantage of increasing the density of information processed ( computed or transmitted ) . in quantum information science , the information is often encoded , processed and carried by single quanta , for instance single photons . for quantum communication",
    "single photons present the drawback of being intrinsically sensitive to losses , which implies that any operation will be rather inefficient .",
    "one can overcome this problem by using multimode encoding .",
    "indeed the multimode capacity of the memory can lead to multiplexing of operations thus effectively increasing the rate of , for instance quantum repeaters @xcite ( i.e. the effective success probability of the operation ) . depending on the system or the type of operation wanted , multiplexing can either be temporal @xcite , spatial @xcite or spectral @xcite . + ensemble - based quantum memories couple strongly to light due to their intrinsic collective enhancement effect .",
    "rare - earth ions doped crystals are promising candidates for quantum memories @xcite thanks to their large bandwidth @xcite and long coherence times @xcite at cryogenic temperature .",
    "they present atomic - like properties without the need of heavy experimental apparatus for manipulation .",
    "numerous achievements in the past years have shown the potential of these lanthanides activated solids for quantum memories . with the goal of achieving a functioning and scalable quantum memory with these crystals ,",
    "several milestones have already been reached : high efficiency of 69@xmath0 @xcite , cavity enhanced storage for a preprogrammed delay @xcite and for spin - wave ( i.e. on - demand ) storage @xcite , high multimode capacity @xcite , long storage time @xcite .",
    "recently the longest coherence time ever ( 6 hours ) was measured @xcite in the same type of crystal we are using here . on -",
    "demand spin - wave storage of classical time - bin pulses has been achieved in @xcite and recently time - bin qubits were successfully stored on - demand at the single photon level @xcite .",
    "recently we also demonstrated on - demand spin - wave storage of a pulse at the single photon level for about 1 ms , using spin - echo techniques to extend the storage time @xcite .",
    "the storage of polarization qubits has however been demonstrated for preprogrammed delays only @xcite .",
    "+ here we show the versatility of spin - wave memory at the single - photon - level by storing 5 polarization qubits multiplexed in time for more than half a millisecond ( 50 times longer than the previously cited work on qubit storage in crystals ) . our device is based on an atomic frequency comb ( afc ) spin - wave memory in an eu@xmath1:y@xmath2sio@xmath3 crystal .",
    "we use the inherent temporal multiplexing to afc memories to boost the rate of operation of our device by increasing the number of modes stored .",
    "we measure the fidelity of the retrieved qubits for several mean numbers of input photons and show that it is always above the classical bound of 2/3 for true single photons .",
    "furthermore we can model the fidelity of our memory based solely on its phase coherence , efficiency and unconditional noise floor .",
    "this allows us to conclude that its fidelity is mainly limited by its signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "the storage protocol we employ is the atomic frequency comb @xcite quantum memory .",
    "we here give a brief description of the essential features of the protocol , particularly the time sequence of the storage process . for a more complete description",
    "we refer to @xcite .    taking advantage of the optical inhomogeneously broadened absorption , we tailor an atomic frequency comb in the absorption profile through a fine selective optical pumping .",
    "the peaks of the comb are separated by @xmath4 which is much smaller than the input bandwidth .",
    "when a photon is absorbed , the single excitation is delocalized over all the atoms .",
    "this large collective state will quickly lose its collective coherence due to the frequency detuning of each atom with respect to the central frequency of the input photon .",
    "since all the participating atoms are located in periodic positions in frequency space ( i.e. @xmath5 with @xmath6 an integer ) they will rephase automatically at a time @xmath7 and thereby cause an echo - type reemission .",
    "we can intuitively see the reemission process as a temporal diffraction ( the inverse fourier transform of the spectral grating i.e. the comb ) of the input pulse .",
    "as such the protocol is a delay line with a preprogrammed reemission time . in order to implement on - demand reemission and which can also give a longer storage time , we can transfer the optical coherence created by an absorbed photon into a spin coherence using a strong @xmath8-pulse called control pulse ( see figure [ fig : setupfinal](b ) and ( c ) ) .",
    "this will freeze the phase evolution due to the tailored inhomogeneous frequency profile .",
    "when we want to retrieve the stored input , a second control pulse is applied , which will restore the optical coherence and the afc phase evolution will continue up to its completion , with the emission of an echo .",
    "this scheme is called an afc spin - wave memory .",
    "note that as shown in figure [ fig : setupfinal](c ) each temporal modes spend the same time in the memory ( both in the excited state and in the spin state ) , such that the storage efficiency is the same for each mode .",
    "+ as for the inhomogeneously broadened optical transition , the spin transition is broadened ( 27 khz in our case ) . using spin - echo techniques",
    "we can compensate the spin dephasing and thus achieve an order of magnitude longer storage time . the rf - sequence used in this work",
    "is called an xy-4 sequence @xcite .",
    "this sequence has the particularity of being robust to errors in population inversion , independent of the phase of the initial spin state .",
    "this is relevant in our experiment since the generation of the spin state through optical storage has a fluctuating phase . indeed in a storage experiment at the quantum level , it is crucial to achieve very high quality of refocusing therefore avoiding unwanted population in the target spin states , which would cause fluorescence ( i.e. noise ) in the output mode ( see @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore each of the four @xmath8-pulses is chirped in amplitude and frequency ( adiabatic pulses @xcite ) in order to achieve efficient population inversion over the entire 27 khz bandwidth of the spin ensemble .",
    "+ the number of temporal modes that can be stored is given by the number of teeth in the comb @xcite .",
    "the number of teeth can be increased either by increasing the bandwidth ( for a fixed @xmath7 storage time ) or by increasing the @xmath7 storage time ( for a fixed bandwidth ) .",
    "one has to take extra care of the bandwidth of the input modes , which can not exceed the bandwidth of the afc .",
    "for the full spin - wave storage scheme , room has to be made for the transfer pulses and of course these control pulses must have the required bandwidth @xcite .",
    "+          the eu@xmath1:y@xmath2sio@xmath3 crystal is a birefringent crystal which exhibits anisotropic absorption .",
    "the crystal is cut along the plane ( d1 , d2 ) and the light is propagating along the b axis , where ( d1 , d2 , b ) are the principal dielectric axes .",
    "there is a coincidence between the principal axes of refraction and absorption so the highest absorption is obtained for light polarized along d1 , the lowest for light with polarization parallel to d2 @xcite .",
    "one can thus decompose an arbitrary polarization state into the orthonormal basis formed by d1 and d2 .",
    "inspired by @xcite we are using a unique crystal in double pass configuration and a quarter - wave plate in - between the two passes ( see figure [ fig : setupfinal](a ) ) .",
    "this ensures that both components of the polarization will experience the same absorption and global refraction .",
    "the polarization is preserved up to the swap operation induced by the quarter - wave plate in double pass configuration .",
    "we quantify the remaining anisotropy by measuring the optical depth and efficiency for different polarization inputs .",
    "we found that the optical depth varies of @xmath9 from the mean value which results in a variation of @xmath10 in the efficiency .",
    "* the crystal and optical setup . * we use an isotopically pure 1 cm long europium doped yttrium orthosilicate crystal , eu@xmath1:y@xmath2sio@xmath3 , with an europium concentration of 1000 ppm .",
    "we work on the @xmath11f@xmath12d@xmath13 transition of site 1 at 580.04 nm whose inhomogeneous broadening is approximately 1.6 ghz and the overall absorption coefficient is @xmath14=2.6 @xmath15 @xcite . the electronic ground and excited states have hyperfine structures @xcite which are shown in figure [ fig : setupfinal](b ) .",
    "the inhomogeneous spin linewidth of the 34.54 mhz spin transition is 27 khz @xcite .",
    "the crystal is cooled down below 4 k in a low - vibration cryostat ( montana instruments cryostation ) .",
    "+ to produce the necessary yellow light , we use a diode laser at 1160 nm , frequency stabilized on a high finesse optical cavity under vacuum .",
    "the laser is frequency doubled and amplified to produce more than 1.8 w at 580 nm .",
    "the light is then sent through a series of acousto - optic modulators ( aoms ) in order to prepare three modes : the input mode , the control mode and the stabilization mode .",
    "the optical setup is shown in figure [ fig : setupfinal](a ) , where both the control and input modes are represented .",
    "the input mode is an attenuated coherent state , whose average photon number can be varied and whose initial polarization is adjusted with the help of a half and quarter waveplate ( _ preparation _ in figure [ fig : setupfinal](a ) ) .",
    "the input mode is then sent through the crystal in the previously mentioned double - pass configuration .",
    "after this it is filtered by a fabry - perot cavity ( finesse 400 and bandwidth 2.5 mhz ) whose resonance is stabilized on the input frequency using the stabilization mode ( not shown ) .",
    "the output mode is finally analyzed with the help of a quarter and half waveplate followed by a polarization beam splitter ( _ analysis _ in figure [ fig : setupfinal](a ) ) .",
    "note here that we are using only one port of the pbs for detection .",
    "the filtering is necessary due to the high power of the control mode ( @xmath16 10@xmath17 photons ) which creates fluorescence and off - resonant coherent emission ( see @xcite ) . to further enhance the filtering ,",
    "the input and control modes are not applied in the same spatial mode .",
    "we detect the output using a single photon avalanche diode ( spad ) gated with another aom ( not shown in figure [ fig : setupfinal](a ) ) before coupling into a fiber with a 9@xmath18 m core .",
    "the total transmission from the input of the cryostat to the detector is 7@xmath0 .",
    "we measure an spad efficiency of 57@xmath193@xmath0 at 580 nm , with a dark count rate of 15 hz . by measuring the counts at the detector and compensating for the rate of experiment , total transmission and detector efficiency we can infer the number of photons at the input of the memory . in the following we will always refer to this value . + * afc preparation . *",
    "the atomic level scheme is shown in figure [ fig : setupfinal](b ) . through optical pumping , we first prepare a selected sub - ensemble of ions into the ground state @xmath20 @xcite . second we create a 2 mhz wide afc structure on the @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 transition using a 0.5 s long sequence of precise spectral holeburning @xcite . during the whole step we optically pump the @xmath23 @xmath21 @xmath22 transition in order to keep the @xmath23 level empty , readying it for spin - wave storage .",

    "+ * storage sequence * the full storage sequence is shown in figure [ fig : setupfinal](c ) : five input modes of 1.25 @xmath18s each are sent in the crystal and stored with the help of two control pulses of 5 @xmath18s duration each . in between the optical control pulses , four population - inverting ( i.e. @xmath8 rotation ) rf pulses resonant with the spin transition are applied with a periodic spacing of @xmath24/4 .",
    "each pulse has a duration of 120 @xmath18s and has a total frequency chirp range of 45 khz around 34.54 mhz .",
    "they are generated with an arbitrary function generator and sent to a 100 w amplifier .",
    "the amplified signal is then sent through a rf circulator , an impedance matched circuit made of two tunable capacitors ( see in figure [ fig : setupfinal](a ) ) and finally a 7-turn coil wrapped around the crystal .",
    "the impedance - matching circuit is tuned to resonate at 34.54 mhz , allowing us to achieve a rabi frequency of 47 khz .",
    "+ we measured a transfer efficiency of 70@xmath195% per optical control pulse .",
    "the absorption probability of the input mode is measured to be 70@xmath193% ( see table [ tab : fidelity_modetr ] in appendix c ) for the comb setting @xmath25s , such that the total conversion efficiency from the optical mode to the spin - wave is about 50% .",
    "the total storage time is @xmath26 = 515 @xmath18s .",
    "+ in the experiment we repeat this storage sequence @xmath27 times , with an experiment rate of 0.8 hz , which leads to an average rate of storage sequence of 14 hz . by proceeding so",
    ", we considerably increase the effective rate of the experiment .",
    "this repetition increases the average population in @xmath23 , which in turn would increase the unconditional noise probability @xmath28 @xcite with increasing number of repetitions @xmath29 . to reduce this accumulation of population",
    "we apply a repump pulse on the @xmath23-@xmath22 transition after each storage cycle .",
    "+ in the present experiment , we store and retrieve five temporally multiplexed photonic qubits encoded with the same state for more than half a millisecond .",

    "in this section , we derive the criterion that was used to infer a quantum behaviour of our memory , given that we probe it with coherent states only .",
    "+ we first summarize an already existing criterion @xcite , which only takes into account the non - unit efficiency of the memory in terms of the output .",
    "we then modify the criterion by also considering that a less than 100 % efficient memory can not entirely absorb the input state .",
    "the main idea relies on the fact that the memory transmits part of the input state with a very good fidelity , so that a classical device that would like to reproduce the behaviour of the memory should also reproduce this transmitted state .      to infer a quantum behaviour of our memory",
    ", we propose to show that a particular protocol based on a measure - and - prepare strategy can not mimic the experimental results .",
    "in other words , if we suppose that instead of the memory we place an eavesdropper , traditionally named eve , that has only classical storage means at his disposal , we would like to know how well she could simulate the experimental results .",
    "it is known that with this strategy and an input qubit encoded into exactly @xmath44 photons , the best achievable fidelity is @xcite : @xmath45 in our experiment we do not use fock states with a well defined number of photons @xmath44 but we use a coherent state with a mean photon number @xmath18 , so that equation ( [ mp ] ) has to be modified . in theory ,",
    "eve could take advantage of the coherence of the state to optimize her measurements on the state and maximize the fidelity of the states she re - sends .",
    "it is though implicitly assumed that the experimentalist that prepares the state can easily blur the phase of the coherent state so that the stored state is only a statistical mixture of fock states , encoding the polarization onto states of the form : @xmath46 then , the output conditional fidelity is simply the statistical mixture of the fidelities for @xmath47 photons : @xmath48.\\ ] ] note that since we use photon counting techniques we do not measure the vacuum state @xmath49 , hence the sum in the equation above starts at @xmath50 .",
    "this is then by definition a conditional fidelity , i.e. conditioned on the detection of at least one photon .      in @xcite ,",
    "the authors have pushed the considerations one step further by taking into account the output inefficiency of the memory , so that eve does not need to output a state each time .",
    "eve can use this to only send an output state only if the number of photons is high enough in the input ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the conditional fidelity is then higher , and can be written as : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a parameter that can be adjusted to mimic the memory efficiency @xmath54 .        in order to duplicate the complete behaviour of the memory ,",
    "a classical scheme should reproduce its imperfections .",
    "one of these is the fact that the coherent state to be stored is not fully absorbed by the material , and part of it leaks into a transmitted state .",
    "we propose to implement a possible scheme based on the previously introduced classical measure - and - prepare strategies , shown on figure [ fideltrans ] .     and",
    "@xmath55.,width=566 ]    in our analysis , we will suppose that whatever the strategy of eve , she has to send a transmitted pulse which has exactly the same fidelity @xmath56 and efficiency @xmath57 as the ones of the experiment , and the stored output pulse should be emitted with the same overall memory efficiency @xmath54 as the one of the experiment .",
    "the parameter that she will try to maximize in the scheme is the fidelity of the output state @xmath58 .",
    "the conclusion of a possible quantum behaviour of the memory will finally be inferred by comparing the best achievable fidelity @xmath58 using this strategy with the one obtained experimentally .    to mimic the quantum memory with this classical scheme , we provide eve two possible strategies :    1 .",
    "she can , in a first strategy , measure the totality of the input pulse and try to infer the qubit state .",
    "she then sends her guess in the transmitted as well as the stored pulse . to correctly reproduce the transmitted and output efficiencies ,",
    "a loss @xmath59 can be adjusted in the output state .",
    "this strategy is depicted in the top part of figure [ fideltrans ] .",
    "2 .   in a second strategy , instead of measuring the whole input state she can simply transmit a part of the state with a beamsplitter of transmission @xmath42 to reproduce the transmitted pulse , and measure the reflected state to reproduce the output pulse . as the fidelity of the transmitted state is generally not expected to be perfect , noise must be added to the state by sending a completely mixed state with probability @xmath60 .",
    "these two strategies are complementary in the sense that the first one could lead to a too high output fidelity , at the cost of the transmitted state fidelity , while the second strategy could have the opposite effect .",
    "then , for each input pulse , eve has the possibility to choose between these two strategies : the first one will be chosen with probability @xmath61 , and the second one with probability @xmath62 .

    "given that @xmath54 is fixed we have @xmath68 the strategy of eve is to search for the maximal fidelity @xmath58 by optimizing over the parameters @xmath69 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
