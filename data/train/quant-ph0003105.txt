    "radiation matter interaction has been studied for a long time with atomic samples .",
    "it is known that density matrix theory is well suited to exhaustively describe the properties of fluorescence from macroscopic atomic ensembles , and that in this limit semiclassical theory gives excellent approximations , since phenomena related to the quantum nature of the light field are often hidden .    on the other hand ,",
    "it has also been realized since more than two decades now that isolation of a single atom provides an opportunity to directly observe pure quantum properties of the interacting radiation - matter system .",
    "a celebrated example is the observation of photon antibunching , where initial experiments @xcite were carried out with extremely diluted atomic beams , and more precise investigations became possible when ion traps were employed to achieve long - term confinement of a single atomic particle @xcite .    for neutral atoms",
    "the confinement strength is reduced since trapping has to rely on forces derived from electric or magnetic dipole interaction .",
    "therefore neutral atoms have only more recently become available for measurements at the microscopic level through the application of laser cooling techniques well established for macroscopic samples with many atoms .",
    "with laser light single neutral atoms can be trapped and observed for long times @xcite in analogy with ion traps .",
    "one of the most powerful methods to observe quantum fluctuations in atom - radiation interaction is to measure photon correlations of the light emitted by a single atom .",
    "the quantum theoretical description of photodetection was put forward by glauber @xcite in the early 60s , and very successfully applied to all appropriate experiments since . in the photon language",
    "the normalized intensity - intensity correlation function is the conditional probability to detect a second photon if a first one was detected a time @xmath0 before .",
    "this second order correlation function is defined by    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the photon number operator constructed from field operators @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and where @xmath5 denotes normal ordering of field operators . at sufficiently long delays",
    "@xmath0 all possible correlations have decayed , and hence @xmath6 .",
    "it is thus often informative to discuss the deviation of @xmath7 from unity , or the quantity @xmath8 as a measure of the fluctuation strength of the system , called _",
    "contrast _ in the following .",
    "for auto correlations ( [ eq : g2 ] ) all classical fields must obey @xmath9 , while photon antibunching shows @xmath10 , making it a prime example of quantum field fluctuations . in an intuitive interpretation it is said @xcite that the first detected photon projects an atom in its ground state . from this initial state",
    "the atom then relaxes back to its equilibrium state on the time scale of its radiative decay . in this sense",
    "the observation of this fluctuation is measurement induced.    in our work we are additionally interested in the case where different atomic transitions can be distinguished by their polarization properties .",
    "we therefore analyze cross correlations of orthogonal polarization states @xmath11 and @xmath12 of the resonance fluorescence from a single atom ,    @xmath13    a single trapped cesium atom shows very strong polarization correlations in its resonance fluorescence .",
    "while this effect is very pronounced for correlations between orthogonal circular polarizations of the detected photons , it vanishes for linearly polarized photons even in a light field with linear polarization at every place .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to show that the strong contrast in @xmath14 that we observe for orthogonally circular polarization states in the fluorescence of a single trapped atom can be interpreted as a direct consequence of the atomic orientation or magnetization undergoing spontaneous or quantum fluctuations .",
    "all classical fields have auto correlations @xmath15 , and a value @xmath16 is classically forbidden ( for classical fields one should replace all operators @xmath17 in ( [ eq : g2 ] ) by their classical counterparts , intensities @xmath18 ) .",
    "this enhanced probability to detect two photons simultaneously is called photon bunching and was observed as early as in 1956 @xcite from a usual thermal light source .    for a single - atom fluorescence , however , @xmath19 vanishes identically for @xmath20 which is a reflection of the fact that one can find at most one photon in the field mode of interest and can never detect two photons simultaneously .",
    "this phenomenon is called photon antibunching and is regarded as an important manifestation of the quantum nature of light .",
    "since the emitted light field reflects the evolution of the atomic dipole moment the correlation function @xmath19 visualizes the internal dynamics of the observed atom for @xmath21 .",
    "the state of an excited atom evolves continuously in the absence of a measurement , but theory predicts a sudden projection to the ground state when a photon is detected .    this measurement triggers the atom to the initial conditions @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 represent the population of the ground and excited atomic state , respectively . at that instant",
    "the coherent evolution starts again from the values @xmath22 and @xmath23 and will be interrupted by the next spontaneous emission .",
    "the normalized probability for detecting a second spontaneously emitted photon is now proportional to the population of the excited atomic state @xmath26 according to @xcite    @xmath27    since the emission times are random , after averaging over many evolution trajectories the measured @xmath7 shows directly relaxation of the system back to the equilibrium state after its wave function has collapsed due to the first photon detection .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rabi1 ] we show @xmath7 of resonance fluorescence from a single atom stored in a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) @xcite with clearly observable photon antibunching and transient oscillations . as we already reported previously @xcite , the observed transient oscillations in the population of the excited state in fig .",
    "[ fig : rabi1 ] corresponding to coherent excitation and deexcitation cycles ( rabi oscillations ) can be surprisingly well described by a simple model ( solid line in fig . [ fig : rabi1 ] ) of a two - level atom ( similar to @xmath28 transition ) in spite of the complicated multilevel structure of the cesium atom and light interference pattern ( see below ) .",
    "this observation suggests that due to optical pumping a trapped atom spends most of its time in the magnetic substate that interacts most strongly with the local field and is forced to behave , to a good approximation , like a two - level system . for @xmath0 larger than the life time of the excited state the correlations die out due to the fluctuations of the vacuum field .",
    "an atom trapped in a mot and moving through the light interference pattern experiences various intensities and polarizations at different places .",
    "the polarization of the resonance fluorescence is determined by the atomic interaction with the local light field and changes on the time scale of atomic transport over an optical wavelength @xmath29 .",
    "thus , in addition to correlations of the total intensity one expects also polarization effects , that is correlations @xmath14 measured between any polarization components @xmath30 and @xmath31 which should strongly depend on the atomic motion and the light - field topography .",
    "the light field of the mot is formed by three mutually orthogonal pairs of counterpropagating laser beams with @xmath32 and @xmath33 polarization .",
    "a pair of two circularly polarized laser beams with the same handedness produces a local polarization that is linear everywhere with a direction of polarization that rotates a full turn every half wavelength . with two additional polarization screws for other directions along with the relative phases @xmath34 and @xmath35 between these standing waves one obtains for the total electric field in a 3d mot@xmath36    @xmath37    we have already reported on strong correlations between circularly polarized photons and vanishing correlations between linear polarization components observed in the resonance fluorescence of a single atom trapped in a standard mot light field configuration @xcite .",
    "this result seems to be intuitive only for specific choices of time phases : for example , @xmath38 yields an antiferromagnetic light - field structure with alternating right- and left - hand circular polarizations at points of deepest light shift potential , see @xcite .",
    "however , in a standard mot the phases @xmath34 and @xmath35 change randomly due to acoustic jitter and thermal drifts .",
    "thus the trapping light field has no well defined polarization state and the correlations are averaged over all possible values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .    since the mot light field topography ( [ eq:3dmot ] )",
    "strongly depends on the relative time - phases of the three contributing standing waves , we have chosen a setup where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are intrinsically stable @xcite .",
    "the concept uses a single standing wave which is multiply folded and brought into triple intersection with itself .",
    "the phases @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be adjusted by means of faraday rotators .",
    "details of this approach have been published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "if one models an atom by a `` classical emitter '' ( @xmath28 transition or steady - state density matrix of a multi - level atom ) then its induced dipole moment will be proportional to the local light field .",
    "this idea is often used for interpretation of polarization correlations in the fluorescence of a large number of laser - cooled atoms @xcite .",
    "as we will show this description fails completely in the case of a single atom .",
    "the most interesting case occurs for @xmath39 .",
    "in this situation the three standing waves oscillate synchronously and thus the interference light field has a linear polarization at every point and lacks handednees completely . in this case the model of a classical emitter @xcite predicts strong correlations between orthogonal linear polarization components and relatively weak correlations between circular components in clear contradiction with experimental results ( see below ) .",
    "for polarization - sensitive correlation measurements we have trapped individual neutral atoms in a standard six - beam mot @xcite with the only exception that the phases and hence the light field topography is fully controlled @xcite . at a quadrupole field gradient of 12.5",
    "g / cm the storage volume extends over approximately 100 @xmath40 m . in order to trap small , countable numbers of atoms the loading rate from the background atomic vapour into the trap",
    "is kept very low .",
    "this is achieved on the one hand by lowering the cesium partial pressure to @xmath41 mbar ( at a base pressure of @xmath42 mbar ) and on the other hand by using trapping laser beams of diameter 4 mm only .",
    "the average number @xmath43 of trapped atoms ( typically between 1 and 5 in this experiment ) can be easily adjusted by variation of the cesium pressure .",
    "although @xmath43 also depends on the trapping laser intensity @xmath44 and detuning @xmath45 of the trapping laser from atomic resonance , we are able to observe trapping of individual atoms over a wide range of parameters : @xmath46 per laser beam and @xmath47 .",
    "the natural linewidth and the saturation intensity of the cooling transition are @xmath48 mhz and @xmath49 mw/@xmath50 , respectively .",
    "the atomic resonance fluorescence is due to excitation by the trapping laser field only .",
    "fluorescent light is collected from a @xmath51 solid angle by a lens and then splitted into orthogonal polarization states by means of polarizing optics ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : poloptics ] ) which also directs the corresponding light onto two avalanche photo diodes ( apd ) .",
    "the apds are operated in single photon counting mode and achieve a photon detection efficiency of 47 % at a dark count rate of 10 s@xmath52 . the average photon count rate for an individual atom lies in the range 3 - 10 khz in our experiments , depending on laser intensity and detuning .",
    "observation direction is in the xy - plane at 45@xmath53 to the laser beams ( the @xmath54-axis is the symmetry axis of the mot quadrupole magnetic field ) .",
    "usually , a measurement of the cross correlation function along with the total intensity - intensity correlation provides complete information : the corresponding auto correlation can be inferred from the sum rules for orthogonal polarization components @xcite .",
    "for example for circular components one has @xmath55 .",
    "a cross correlation measurement ( @xmath56 ) can be carried out 4 times faster than the corresponding auto correlation measurement ( @xmath57 ) where only one half of the total fluorescence is detected .",
    "a computer registers the arrival times of all photons from the two apd channels with 100 ns time resolution and with 700 ns dead time in each channel .",
    "the entire experimental information accessible in the set - up is stored and thus can be processed afterwards by correlation analysis through numerical multi - stop procedures , which completely eliminate systematic errors such as photon pile - up introduced by single - stop methods traditionally used in hanbury brown & twiss type experiments @xcite .",
    "atoms are randomly loaded from background vapour and randomly lost due to collisions with background gas .",
    "but since individual atom arrival and departure events are easily located within 1 ms , it is straightforward to determine the instantaneous number of atoms from the average count rate .",
    "note that the number of trapped atoms fluctuates on the second time scale @xcite .",
    "this enables us to separate all data from a single experimental run into different classes with the number of trapped atoms as a parameter - the data for different atom numbers are therefore obtained under identical experimental conditions .",
    "it is also easily possible to distinguish correlations of the fluorescence of trapped individual atoms from uncorrelated background of detection events due to stray light or fluorescence from thermal , untrapped atoms . as a consequence",
    "all measured correlation functions can always be unequivocal normalized .",
    "measured second order correlation functions for orthogonal polarization components in the fluorescence of a single atom in the mot@xmath58 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pol_corr ] . within our experimental uncertainties correlations",
    "are completely absent for linear polarization components of the fluorescence , in baffling contrast with the result for circularly polarized components .    for a single atom the circular correlation contrast reaches s values",
    "up to 62% .",
    "this very strong correlation typically relaxes within a few @xmath40s .",
    "since photon antibunching and rabi oscillations at ns time scales are not resolved in these measurements , we have assumed for a simple analysis the relaxation process of the polarization correlations to be exponential and extracted a single relaxation time constant @xmath59 .",
    "the intensity - intensity auto correlation @xmath7 also shows a contrast of about 30% due to intensity modulations of the mot light field , but the relaxation time constant of about 0.6 @xmath40s in fig .",
    "[ fig : int_corr ] is significantly shorter than for the circular cross correlations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have experimentally verified that @xmath59 does not depend on the number of trapped atoms and that the contrast of the correlation function is proportional to the inverse number of atoms , @xmath60 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ndepend ] ) .",
    "thus , as one would expect , we deal with a pure single - atom effect .",
    "in order to interpret the polarization properties of the resonance fluorescence of atoms driven by a light field with linear polarization we begin by considering an atom at rest . as this light field",
    "does not favor any of the two circular polarization states , one can assume that prior to the detection of the first photon the distribution of atomic magnetic sublevels is symmetric , @xmath61 .",
    "if we suppose for simplicity that the local light field consists of equal parts of both orthogonal circular polarizations only , it is clear that the @xmath61 state is unstable @xcite . at the level of an individual particle this equilibrium state",
    "can be distorted by the observation of a single circularly polarized photon , which projects the atom into its ground state , breaks the symmetry of the zeeman substate population ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pops ] ) , and creates an imbalance in the interaction strengths with both circular polarization components . the next absorption will be preferentially further enhance the asymmetry .",
    "the imbalance in the interaction strengths rapidly grows with @xmath62 leading to fast pumping into one of the outmost zeeman states @xmath63 .",
    "the ratio of the interaction strengths in these stretched states reaches the value @xmath64 making them very stable for large @xmath65 even in the presence of the polarization component in the light field driving @xmath66 transitions .",
    "the atom in this oriented state prefers to radiate into the same polarization state as the first detected photon , resulting in anticoincidences in the cross correlation for orthogonal circular polarizations .",
    "note that this effect is a specific feature of @xmath67 transitions and does not occur for @xmath68 or @xmath69 transitions .",
    "it can be regarded as bistability , since an emission of a circularly polarized photon makes the atom more likely to be pumped in the corresponding outmost zeeman state . as both stretched states @xmath70 and @xmath71 are equivalent in the presence of a linear polarized light field , this effect is principally unobservable in an atomic ensemble . however ,",
    "if one adds some circular polarization component to the driving light field a spontaneous spin polarization of a macroscopic sample can be observed as recently demonstrated in @xcite by optically pumping on the @xmath72 hyperfine component of the @xmath73-line of cs .",
    "although the real 3d - situation in our experiment is much more complicated than the simple model presented above , our interpretation is furthermore supported by the following considerations : as noted in @xcite , the condition for magnetic bistability in a linearly polarized light field is given by @xmath74 , where @xmath31 is the angle between the magnetic field ( quantization axis ) and the light polarization . in the mot@xmath58",
    "there are 8 intensity antinodes in a unit cell with directions of the local linear polarization at these points coinciding with the diagonals of the coordinate system @xmath75 .",
    "it is easy to see that the bistability condition is fulfilled for the majority of points in the mot magnetic quadrupole field @xmath76 .",
    "however , in our case the stretched states are not intrinsically stable .",
    "while radiation pressure forces are balanced for an aligned atom with @xmath77=0 , they are unbalanced for an oriented atom since the local linearly polarized light field is created by ( at least two ) _ counterpropagating _ laser beams with orthogonal circular polarizations .",
    "the imbalance in the light forces created by atomic orientation thus causes acceleration , or heating which is again damped by the usual laser friction forces @xcite .",
    "thus for our experiment we must acknowledge that the observation of a circularly polarized photon not only redefines atomic orientation but also its mechanical status : internal and external atomic degrees of freedom are inextricably entangled .    the measured relaxation time constant of @xmath78 indeed depends strongly on the atom - light field interaction which also governs atomic motion in the trap .",
    "the interaction strength is measured by the light shift parameter @xmath79 @xcite corresponding to the maximum energy shift of the atomic energy levels . under our experimental parameters",
    "sub - doppler cooling leads to atomic temperatures proportional to the light shift , thus @xmath80 @xcite .    in fig.[fig : tauvslsh ] we show the measured dependence of the time constant @xmath59 as a function of @xmath79 .",
    "as expected we find good agreement of our experimental data with the functional relationship @xmath81 . here",
    "@xmath82 denotes the average atomic velocity .",
    "this means that relaxation of the spontaneous atomic magnetization is determined by atomic motion through the light field .",
    "we can carry out our analysis one step further if we assume that the characteristic length over which relaxation takes place is @xmath83 = @xmath84 , the spatial period of the mot light field .",
    "it is then straightforward to evaluate characteristic kinetic temperatures from our correlation measurements to be in the range between 10 - 68 @xmath40k for the @xmath79 range shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tauvslsh ] , in good agreement with previous measurements @xcite .",
    "photon correlations observed in the resonance fluorescence of a single atom provide a direct access to the internal atomic dynamics .",
    "we have shown two examples of resolved quantum dynamics of an isolated atom stored in a magneto - optical trap . beyond observation of the well - known phenomenon of transient rabi oscillations ( usually connected with photon antibunching ) ,",
    "we have observed fluctuations of the atomic magnetic orientation by measuring photon correlations between orthogonal polarization components .    using a simple model we have given evidence for the following dynamical processes causing strong circular cross correlations in resonance fluorescence : spontaneous emission of circularly polarized photons causes instantaneous orientation .",
    "subsequent photons are preferentially absorbed and emitted with identical polarization .",
    "this memory effect leading to correlated absorption of photons with equal polarization and thus to increased momentum diffusion of an atom with a multi - level structure has been discussed in @xcite . in our experiments",
    "we can clearly isolate this effect by observation of an anticorrelation of circularly polarized photons successively emitted with opposite handedness .",
    "subsequent optical pumping induced by atomic motion in the light field causes relaxation of the orientation clearly seen in the photon correlations . in a sense",
    "we have seen the elementary sub - doppler cooling and heating forces in a @xmath85-molasses at work .",
    "we thank svenja knappe for providing some basic techniques in an early stage of the experiment .",
