    "the recent discovery of large numbers of radio - selected quasars with very red optical  to  near - infrared colours suggests that existing quasar surveys may be severely incomplete .",
    "based on a high identification rate in the optical and near - infrared , webster et al .",
    "( 1995 ) found a broad range of colours with @xmath2 for flat - spectrum radio quasars in a subsample of the parkes 2.7ghz survey ( drinkwater et al .",
    "1997 ; hereafter ` parkes quasars ' ) . for comparison ,",
    "quasars selected by standard optical techniques show a small scatter around @xmath3 .",
    "two theories have been proposed to explain the large scatter : first , webster et al .",
    "( 1995 ) interpreted this in terms of extinction by line - of - sight dust ( see also masci 1997 ) , and second , serjeant & rawlings ( 1996 ) suggested that this was due to intrinsically red optical / infrared synchrotron radiation associated with the radio emission .",
    "this paper explores a third possibility : that the red colours are due to contamination by starlight from the host galaxies .    in a recent near - infrared imaging study of a sample of radio - quasars selected from the low - frequency ( 408mhz ) catalog , benn et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found that sources with red @xmath4 colours to @xmath5 could be explained by an excess of host galaxy light in @xmath6 .",
    "most of the images appeared non - stellar ( or resolved ) suggesting that indeed starlight was responsible for the redness in @xmath4 colour .",
    "it is important to note however that all these sources were associated with extended radio galaxies of which a majority are of the steep - spectrum type , a common feature of low - frequency selected samples .",
    "a large fraction are also often associated with luminous giant ellipticals . in view of the simple orientation - based unified model for radio - loud agn ,",
    "it is possible that galaxy light is more easily detected in these sources due to anisotropic obscuration and/or unbeamed emission of the central agn .",
    "the radio - quasars explored in this paper are all of the flat - spectrum type selected at moderately high frequency .",
    "thus , they are not expected to exhibit similar properties in the near - infrared .",
    "the @xmath4 colours of normal radio galaxies are known to be quite red , exhibiting a similar dispersion to those observed in the parkes sample .",
    "these sources are often associated with giant ellipticals and their colours appear to be uniformly distributed over the range @xmath7 for redshifts @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the host galaxies of parkes quasars also exhibit similar properties . to determine the importance of host galaxy light in parkes quasars , we need to quantify its contribution throughout the optical to near - ir wavelength region .",
    "determining the host galaxy properties of radio - quasars and bl - lac - type sources are crucial for studies of agn evolution and testing unified schemes . a significant number of bl - lacs and other core - dominated radio loud agn are surrounded by nebulosities whose optical spectra are very similar to those of giant ellipticals @xcite .",
    "a majority of these host galaxies have been detected in sources at relatively low redshifts , @xmath9 , where the galaxy flux is easily detected .",
    "since most quasars are at high redshifts , host galaxy detections have been difficult due to contamination by their strong nuclear emission .",
    "recent high resolution imaging using hst has revealed that a majority of high redshift quasars also reside in giant ellipticals @xcite .",
    "the optical spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of ellipticals are all similar in shape . at @xmath10",
    ", they rise steeply up to @xmath11@xmath12 where a sharp step - like cutoff is observed .",
    "this cutoff is often refered to as the `` 4000 angstrom break '' and is caused by the dearth of hot and young , usually o and b - type stars with time , whose spectra mostly dominate at wavelengths from @xmath13   into the uv . for @xmath14 , the existence of a multiplet of heavy metal absorption lines arising from stellar atmospheres , results in a steepening of the break .",
    "the presence of this feature thus provides a signature for determining whether an underlying elliptical host is contributing to the total light .    in this paper",
    ", we describe a new unbiased method that uses the size of this characteristic break in the optical spectra of parkes quasars to quantify the host galaxy contribution .",
    "we use this method to investigate whether the host galaxies of parkes quasars can significantly contribute to the optical and near - ir continua and hence cause the spread in @xmath4 colours observed .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section  [ outgc ] , we outline our method used to quantify the host galaxy contribution .",
    "a discussion of the spectral data and assumed input parameters is given in section  [ data ] .",
    "results are presented in section  [ regcp ] .",
    "implications for agn unified schemes are explored in section  [ tuf ] and results discussed in section  [ diseven ] .",
    "all results are summarised in section  [ concsix ] .",
    "the galaxy contribution can be estimated using an algorithm that determines the relative strength of the characteristic 4000@xmath12 break in the optical spectra of parkes sources in an unbiased way .",
    "no other feature in a generic quasar spectrum will mimic this feature . in this section",
    ", we describe this algorithm .",
    "there are two important assumptions that will be required by our algorithm .",
    "first , we assume that the spectral shape defining an underlying quasar optical continuum is ` smooth ' and contains no breaks .",
    "this is justified by our current knowledge of quasar optical spectra .",
    "our choice for this shape is somewhat arbitrary , and will be further discussed in section  [ method ] .",
    "second , we need to assume the input galaxy spectrum which defines the shape of the 4000@xmath12 break to be used in our analysis . we have formed a composite optical spectrum of 18 parkes sources all of which appear ` spatially extended ' in @xmath15 .",
    "this composite is shown as the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ galspec ] and clearly shows the characteristic 4000@xmath12 break .",
    "superimposed ( dashed ) is an elliptical galaxy sed predicted from the stellar population synthesis models of bruzual & charlot  .",
    "this model is for a galaxy of age 8gyr , and assumes a 1gyr burst described by a salpeter initial mass function with no star formation thereafter .",
    "in fact , any ` old aged ' model with long completed star formation will in general be similar .",
    "models assuming ` long lived ' constant star formation rates lead to considerably bluer optical - uv continua , characteristic of those observed in spirals . the composite and model in fig .",
    "[ galspec ] are in excellent agreement , except for the emission lines arising from ism gas in the composite . in our analysis , we shall assume that this model represents the underlying elliptical sed in each of our parkes sources .    for sources with redshifts @xmath16 ,",
    "the @xmath17@xmath12 break is redshifted out of the wavelength range available in the spectra of parkes quasars ( see section  [ apal ] ) and thus , can not be used in our algorithm .",
    "we are therefore restricted to @xmath18 . for simplicity , we assume that the general shape of our model elliptical sed is independent of redshift to @xmath19 .",
    "the colours of radio galaxies observed to @xmath20 are consistent with formation redshifts @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "these formation redshifts are also suggested by models of galaxy formation in the cdm scenario  @xcite .",
    "the spectral synthesis models predict that the general form of an elliptical sed shown in fig .",
    "[ galspec ] can be immediately established following an almost instantaneous ( @xmath22gyr ) burst of star formation . adopting the 1gyr burst model of bruzual & charlot   ( updated 1995 models ) , we show in fig .",

    "initially , the 4000@xmath12 break region is diluted by starburst activity . after a few gigayears ,",
    "the stellar population evolves passively , maintaining an almost uniform sed shape ( see bruzual & charlot 1993 ) . for formation epochs @xmath24 ,",
    "it is apparent that the generic elliptical sed shape of fig .",
    "[ galspec ] is easily established by @xmath19 .      in general , the total flux at a given wavelength observed in a parkes source , @xmath25 , can be modelled as the sum of light contributed by the central quasar or agn , @xmath26 , and any underlying host galaxy @xmath27 ( eg . fig .",
    "[ galspec ] ) .",
    "we write the relationship between these quantities as : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a scaling factor giving an arbitrary measure of the amount of galaxy light we wish to determine for a particular source .    given @xmath25 for a particular source and an arbitrary galaxy spectrum @xmath27 ( fig .",
    "[ galspec ] ) , our aim is to determine the value of @xmath29 such that @xmath26 looks something like a quasar spectrum . from our knowledge of quasar optical spectra ,",
    "an obvious choice is to require that @xmath26 be `` smooth '' and contain no breaks .",

    "the validity of our assumption of a single power - law for @xmath26 is discussed in section  [ diseven ] .    to apply this algorithm in a self consistent way to each of our optical spectra",
    ", we need to define a figure of merit indicating the point at which the maximum amount of galaxy spectrum has been subtracted and a `` smooth '' quasar spectrum ( ie . a power - law )",
    "is achieved .",
    "let us first consider the rest frame optical spectrum of a source , @xmath25 , suspected of containing a 4000@xmath12 break .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ schematic ] .",
    "furthermore , let us consider a `` smooth '' power - law ( ie .",

    "[ galspec ] ) are gradually subtracted from @xmath25 , @xmath39 will decrease and becomes a minimum when the break disappears .",
    "we can thus determine the value of @xmath29 when this occurs , allowing us to estimate the fractional galaxy contribution from eqn .",

    "[ alpha2 ] and  [ fqminmax ] .",
    "thus , one would only have to minimise @xmath39 with respect to @xmath29 in order to determine the maximal galactic contribution .",
    "we introduce however , an additional factor in eqn .",
    "[ atwo ] whose purpose will be to make best use of the available data and optimise our algorithm .",
    "due to systematic effects , each parkes optical spectrum suffers from a considerable amount of noise at the range of observed wavelengths .",
    "although the noise may have some wavelength dependence , we assume it is constant .",
    "given this assumption , we have used an optimal method that gives more weight to those wavelengths in a particular spectrum where the residual @xmath43 ( see fig .",
    "[ schematic ] ) is likely to be a maximum . in other words ,",
    "the galaxy subtraction process will depend most sensitively on the spectral shape around the 4000@xmath12 break region .",
    "our assumption that the noise is wavelength independent will greatly simplify our optimisation method , since otherwise , we would have to simultaneously optimise those observed spectral regions with the highest signal - to - noise .",
    "the basis of this method simply involves convolving the integrand in eqn .",

    "studies of the host galaxy properties of bl - lacs and radio - quasars can be used as a test of the unified scheme for radio - loud agn .",
    "motivated by the canonical axisymmetric model for agn , the basis of this scheme is that the appearence of an extragalactic radio source is primarily determined by viewing geometry . extended fri and frii - type radio galaxies are believed to represent the parent ( misaligned ) populations of the more compact bl - lacs and radio quasars respectively  @xcite .",
    "if classification is purely based on orientation , then intrinsic properties such as host galaxy luminosity should be approximately uniform throughout . in this section",
    ", we shall test this hypothesis .",
    "studies have shown that for quasars and frii radio galaxies at redshifts @xmath109 , the situation is not entirely clear . from comparisons of their mean host galaxy luminosities , some studies have shown that frii hosts are fainter by @xmath110 - 1 mag .",
    "@xcite , while others have concluded that they are comparable ( eg . taylor et al .",
    "the main difficulty in these studies was finding sufficiently large samples of radio galaxies and quasars matched both in radio power and redshift .",
    "there is strong observational evidence however that the low redshift bl - lacs reside in giant ellipticals with mean optical luminosities and de vaucoleurs @xmath111 law profiles similar to those in fris  @xcite .",
    "very little is known about the host galaxies of compact radio sources at higher redshifts . using our algorithm however , we can get estimates of host galaxy @xmath6 magnitudes for sources up to @xmath19 .",
    "we can predict the host galaxy @xmath6 magnitudes of parkes sources directly from our estimates of the fractional galaxy contribution in the @xmath6-band , @xmath107 ( see section  [ galcont ] ) . the host galaxy magnitude in an observer s frame can be written : @xmath112 } , \\label{kgalobs}\\ ] ] where @xmath113 is the observed @xmath6 magnitude of the source .",
    "as discussed in section  [ galcont ] , @xmath107 is determined from the median spectral flux at @xmath114 m ( eqn .",
    "[ galfrac ] ) , which we estimate using the observed spectral flux at @xmath115@xmath12 and @xmath98 colour .",
    "estimates of @xmath116 as a function of redshift are shown in fig .",
    "[ kgalfig ] . for comparison",
    ", we also show the range observed for radio galaxies ( shaded region ) as determined from a number of independent studies ( mccarthy 1993 ) . within our quoted uncertainties",
    ", there appears to be no significant difference in the mean host galaxy magnitude of `` compact '' parkes sources and extended radio galaxies at the redshifts indicated .",
    "the compact sources however appear to show a larger scatter in @xmath116 at some redshift .",
    "since the @xmath116 values were determined from non - contemporaneous measures of observed @xmath15 spectral fluxes and @xmath98 colours , this may be attributed to variability in the underlying agn .",
    "we are unable at present to quantify this uncertainty . from fig .",
    "[ kgalfig ] , we conclude that the host galaxy luminosities of these two classes of radio source is consistent with that required by the unified model .",
    "our results of section  [ galcont ] clearly show that galactic emission is unlikely to fully explain the dispersion in @xmath98 colours observed .",
    "this conclusion is only valid however for sources at redshifts @xmath117 . at higher redshifts ,",
    "the 4000@xmath12 break feature on which our algorithm is based is redshifted out of our observational wavelength range .",
    "taking into account our completeness in spectral data ( section  [ data ] ) , only 53 of the 323 sources in the drinkwater et al .",
    "sample have been analysed using our algorithm .",
    "since we are limited to redshifts @xmath117 , it is possible that we are biased towards detecting relatively large galaxy contributions .",
    "our results may thus not be representative for the whole sample of parkes quasars .",
    "we have two strong pieces of observational evidence that supports a minimal galaxy contribution from the high redshift parkes sources : first , all sources with @xmath118 appear very compact in @xmath6 ( eg . fig .  [ kfracvsz ] ) , and exhibit broad - line equivalent widths typical of those observed in optically - selected quasars .",
    "second , significantly high levels of linear polarisation ( @xmath119 ) have been observed in the near - ir in several sources at @xmath16 ( see masci 1997 ) .",
    "this strongly indicates that the emission is dominated by a non - thermal mechanism .",
    "it is important to note however that the number of sources in which a polarisation has been searched for is too low to draw any reasonable conclusion .",
    "further polarimetric studies of preferably the reddest quasars are necessary to asses the importance of a host galaxy component .",
    "the next significant step in improving the algorithm presented here for determining the galaxy contribution would be to completely discard our assumption of a power - law for the shape of the underlying quasar spectrum .",
    "although a simple power - law is a good overall representation for the _ continuum _ around @xmath120 , generic quasar spectra also include a complex blend of emission line features superimposed on the continuum about this region . as seen in most compilations of composite qso spectra ( eg . francis et al .",
    "1991 ) , wavelengths shortwards of @xmath121   are contaminated by a balmer coninuum , where emission from the convergence of high order balmer lines can introduce a steep rise in this part of the spectrum .",
    "furthermore there is also a complex blend of feii emission setting in at these wavelengths .",
    "these considerations therefore invalidate our assumption of a pure power - law for the `` smooth '' quasar spectrum .",
    "nonetheless , it is likely that the omission of these additional intrinsic features at @xmath14   will have led us to overestimate the galaxy contribution on average .",
    "this paper has explored whether emission from the host galaxies of parkes quasars can significantly contribute to the relatively large spread in @xmath98 colours observed .",
    "if the hosts are classical giant ellipticals and their flux strongly contributes , then this would be expected since elliptical colours are known to be quite red in @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "we have devised an algorithm that measures the relative galaxy contribution in each source in an unbiased way using the characteristic 4000@xmath12 break feature of elliptical galaxy seds .",
    "the basis of the algorithm involves subtracting a generic elliptical sed from each source spectrum until the 4000@xmath12 break feature disapears and what is left is a `` smooth '' spectrum containing no breaks .",
    "this `` smooth '' spectrum we refer to as the underlying quasar spectrum .",
    "the only requirement by our algorithm is that this remaining spectrum be smooth .",
    "the galactic contribution , relative to the total light at any wavelength is estimated from the amount of galaxy subtracted .",
    "the main conclusions are : + 1 . for @xmath81 , (",
    "for which the 4000@xmath12 feature remains observable in our spectra ) , we find broad and almost bimodal distributions in the relative galaxy fraction in @xmath15 and @xmath6 .",
    "most sources ( @xmath122 ) have galaxy fractions @xmath123 at the @xmath100 level in both @xmath15 and @xmath6 .",
    "the remainder have large galaxy contributions and are predominately low redshift galaxies with strong 4000@xmath12 breaks .",
    "all of these latter sources are spatially extended and resolved on @xmath15 and @xmath6-band images .",
    "in particular , there is a clear distinction in the strength of the 4000@xmath12 break for resolved and unresolved sources .",
    "+ 2 . using these estimates , we find that the mean @xmath6-band magnitude of the host galaxies of flat spectrum radio quasars is consistent with that of extended radio galaxies at @xmath81 .",
    "this is consistent with the unified model for radio - loud agn .",
    "+ 3 . by subtracting the galaxy contribution in each bandpass from the observed @xmath98 colours of parkes sources",
    ", we find that at predominately the @xmath0 confidence level , the relatively large spread in colours still remains .",
    "we conclude that in a majority of cases , the relatively red colours must be due to a mechanism other than that contributed by a `` red '' stellar component .",
