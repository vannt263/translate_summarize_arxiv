    "spacetimes are geometrical objects , independent of the coordinates with which we describe them .",
    "however , spacetimes are typically presented and visualized in a specific coordinate system . if the coordinates are poorly chosen , many properties of the spacetime such as horizons , causally connected spacetime points , maximal extensions and null infinity are not readily apparent .",
    "a simplification occurs if a @xmath4 dimensional lorentzian spacetime has enough fibered directions ( like a @xmath5-sphere ) or other ignorable directions .",
    "one can draw two dimensional diagrams for the remaining directions and such lorentzian @xmath6 signature spacetime slices can be conformally compactified leading to penrose diagrams .",
    "penrose diagrams are quite useful in understanding spacetime geometry and successful especially in understanding causal structure although there are some limitations to this approach .",
    "for instance just knowing the penrose diagram for the subextremal @xmath7 reissner - nordstrm black hole does not tell us what happens to the spacetime structure in the chargeless or extremal limits . for more complicated spacetimes , penrose diagrams ( which assume symmetry or fibering )",
    "can only draw a slice of the spacetime . as a known example ,",
    "the penrose diagram for a kerr black hole does not clearly depict the ring singularity and the possibility of crossing through the interior of the ring into a second universe .",
    "in addition , recently analytic continuation has been applied to black hole solutions to yield bubble - type @xcite or s - brane @xcite solutions .",
    "oftentimes this is done in boyer - lindquist type coordinates which are hard to visualize .",
    "again we are not left with a clear picture of the resulting spacetime and the penrose diagrams are missing important noncompact spatial directions .",
    "it is useful to have an alternative diagram which can also capture important features of a spacetime .",
    "for this reason in this paper we expand the notion of drawing spacetimes in weyl space @xcite .",
    "because our diagrams have the appearance of playing cards glued together we will dub them weyl card diagrams .    to understand the construction of a card diagram we recall that in @xmath8 dimensions a weyl solution in canonical coordinates @xcite",
    "is written as @xmath9\\ ] ] where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are functions of @xmath12 .",
    "the original weyl class requires two commuting orthogonal killing fields @xmath13 in four dimensions @xcite , or @xmath14 fields for general @xmath4 dimensions @xcite .",
    "are discussed in @xcite . ]",
    "sometimes weyl solutions are called axially - symmetric gravitational solutions although they in fact are more general .",
    "we also include the weyl - papapetrou class for 2 commuting killing vectors in @xmath8 @xcite , and allow charged static solutions in @xmath15 ( see the appendix to this paper ) .",
    "furthermore stationary vacuum solutions in @xmath15 are covered with the recent work of @xcite . in four and five dimensions this generalized weyl class includes spinning charged black holes and rings @xcite as well as various arrays @xcite of black holes , spacelike - branes , and includes backgrounds like melvin fluxbranes @xcite and spinning ergotubes @xcite .",
    "when constructing card diagrams , we will draw only weyl s canonical coordinates @xmath16 , or coordinates related to them via a conformal transformation .",
    "the killing coordinates are ignorable and so this diagram is efficient and will show all details of the spacetime .",
    "since there are only two nontrivial coordinates , card diagrams are two dimensional and easy to draw like penrose diagrams .",
    "the difference however is that while penrose diagrams are truly two - dimensional , card diagrams are drawn as if embedded in three dimensions . when a @xmath16 region of the spacetime has euclidean @xmath17 signature , we draw the two coordinates @xmath16 horizontally ; and this makes a horizontal card . for lorentzian signature",
    "@xmath6 regions we use @xmath18 or @xmath19 , and draw the timelike coordinate vertically ; this makes a vertical card .",
    "causal structure is automatically built into the vertical cards since for example the directions @xmath19 appear conformally only through the combination @xmath20 .",
    "horizontal cards and vertical cards are attached together at killing horizons and so card diagrams resemble a gluing - together of a house of playing cards .    in this paper we will present card diagrams for the familiar spacetimes of black holes , as well as expanding bubbles , s - branes , and black rings .",
    "many other spacetimes including the s - dihole , infinite periodic universe , c - metric , and multiple - rod solutions in 4 and 5 dimensions are presented in @xcite , and spacetimes derived from 4 and 5 dimensional kerr geometries will be presented in @xcite .    in section 2",
    "we review the schwarzschild black hole in the usual coordinates and in weyl coordinates . by extending through the horizon and properly representing the interior of the black hole",
    "we construct the first card diagram .",
    "we emphasize the construction of the interior of the black hole as a vertical card comprised of four triangles unfolded across special null lines .",
    "we then discuss general card diagram properties such as null lines , list the available card types , and geometrically describe the @xmath11-flip analytic continuation procedure .    in section 3 , we discuss the sub / super / extremal reissner - nordstrm black hole card diagrams , the kerr black hole , and the black ring / c - metric card diagrams .",
    "we then show that a spacetime can have multiple card diagrams and as examples present the elliptic , hyperbolic , and parabolic representations of the charged witten bubble and charged spacelike brane which we also call s - reissner - nordstrm . finally ,",
    "as a newer example we discuss the ( twisted ) s - kerr solution @xcite .",
    "we conclude with a discussion in section 4 .",
    "we give an appendix on perturbing witten bubbles and s - branes by introducing israel - khan rods , in their hyperbolic or elliptic representations .",
    "we also give an appendix on how the higher dimensional vacuum weyl ansatz can be extended to include electromagnetic fields .",
    "this paper is a condensed presentation of the card diagrams in @xcite .",
    "in this section we review the schwarzschild black hole as an example of a weyl spacetime and then we explain the construction of its associated weyl card diagram .",
    "general features and properties of card diagrams are also developed .",
    "up to now if a solution such as the schwarzschild black hole had horizons , then only the regions outside the horizons have been drawn in weyl coordinates @xcite . to go through a nonextremal horizon ,",
    "the weyl coordinate @xmath21 must be allowed to take imaginary values .",
    "we discuss how the horizon can be represented as a junction of four regions which we call four cards .",
    "the regions outside the horizon will be drawn as two horizontal cards while the regions between the horizon and the singularity will be drawn as two vertical cards .",
    "the interior vertical cards naively are problematic and have fourfold - covered triangles bounded by ` special null lines ' .",
    "however the triangles can be unfolded and glued together into a square along the ` special null lines ' to achieve a singly covered representation of the spacetime in weyl coordinates by properly choosing branches of a square root in the solution .",
    "note that card diagrams represent the spaces on which we solve the laplace equation ( horizontal card ) or wave equation ( vertical card ) to find a weyl metric .",
    "for example , the schwarzschild black hole has a finite length uniform density rod source along the @xmath22-axis generating the potential @xmath23 , and the remainder of its @xmath22-axis encodes the vanishing of the @xmath24-circle .",
    "thus card diagrams give a full account of the boundary conditions necessary to specify the spacetime .",
    "this section will describe the construction of the schwarzschild black hole card diagram .",
    "the penrose and card diagrams are compared in fig .",
    "[ penrose - weyl - comparison ] .",

    "canonical coordinates the metric ansatz is @xcite it is @xmath28 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are functions of the coordinates @xmath21 and @xmath22 : @xmath29 previously attention was restricted to the h1 half - plane @xmath30 , @xmath31 , known as weyl space , which describes the exterior of the black hole and whose horizon is represented by a ` rod ' line segment @xmath32 , @xmath33 ; see fig .",
    "[ weylrod ] .",
    "note that the non - killing 2-metric is conformal to the euclidean flat space @xmath34 .",
    "the coordinate transformation between schwarzschild and weyl coordinates is @xmath35    now we wish to ask how weyl s coordinates draw the spacetime inside the horizon",
    ". the schwarzschild coordinates ( [ coordinatetrans ] ) tell us that for @xmath36 , @xmath21 is imaginary and so we set @xmath37 .",
    "( in general we must perform an analytic continuation of weyl coordinates to go through a horizon which are at the zeros of the weyl functions @xmath38 . )",
    "the analytic continuation gives a region with a conformally minkowskian metric @xmath39 and we will draw this region as being vertical and perpendicularly attached to the horizontal card at the horizon @xmath33",
    ". the vertical direction is always timelike in card diagrams .",
    "of course the schwarzschild horizon structure is more complicated than just having two cards joined together .",
    "for example we know the penrose diagram in the @xmath40 coordinates is divided into four regions that meet in a @xmath41-horizon structure . in weyl",
    "coordinates , we already saw that we can extend @xmath42 or go to negative @xmath21 .",
    "this gives us the four regions of the schwarzschild black hole in weyl coordinates .",
    "two regions will be horizontal at real values of @xmath21 and two regions will be vertical with imaginary values of @xmath21 .",
    "so in addition to the first horizontal card in front of the horizon , we also have a copy of the horizontal external universe behind the horizon and attach two vertical cards , one above and one mirror copy below the horizontal cards ( see fig .  [ penrose - weyl - comparison ] ) .",
    "all together , four different regions attach together at the same @xmath33 rod horizon .",
    "the four regions labelled h1 , h2 , v1 and v2 in the penrose diagram map to the similarly labelled four regions on the card diagram in fig .",
    "[ penrose - weyl - comparison ] .",
    "note that the weyl cards draw the @xmath43 coordinates which is different from the @xmath44 coordinates of the penrose diagram .",
    "however the fact that the radial coordinate @xmath45 describes four distinct regions , two where @xmath46 is spacelike and two where it is timelike , is still apparent in the weyl card diagram .",
    "so while a penrose diagram always has a lorentzian @xmath6 signature , a card diagram will flip from being euclidean @xmath17 to lorentzian @xmath6 across a nonextremal killing horizon .",
    "let us now examine the construction of the upper vertical card extended in the @xmath47 directions .",
    "looking at an @xmath45-orbit for @xmath48 $ ] on the vertical card , we see that in weyl coordinates @xmath49 .",
    "the bounding lines where @xmath50 , we will call ` special null lines , ' and they are a general feature of vertical cards with focal points ( the rod endpoints @xmath51 ) . here , special null lines are the envelope of the @xmath45-orbits as we vary @xmath52 . inside the horizon",
    "the schwarzschild coordinates apparently fill out a 45 - 45 - 90 degree weyl triangle with hypotenuse length @xmath53 a total of four times , as shown in figure  [ 4xcoverfig ] .",
    "special null lines play an important role in weyl card diagrams so let us explain their significance .",
    "keep in mind that we have already broken the manifest spherical symmetry when we have written the schwarzschild metric in weyl coordinates , so the existence of preferred special null lines is relative to this chosen axis .",
    "consider the two 3-surfaces [ blr ] r_=r - mm = 0,which are drawn in fig .",
    "[ cardioids ] .",
    "these surfaces bound the trajectories of light rays that do not move in the killing directions .",
    "the surfaces intersect at @xmath54 and partition the black hole interior into four subregions .",
    "these regions correspond to the four weyl triangles .     and height @xmath55 .",
    "as we illustrate , the triangle interior is covered four times by orbits of @xmath45 at four different values of @xmath52.,width=302 ]     into four subregions.,width=302 ]    it is clear from ( [ blr ] ) that @xmath56 is positive outside the horizon and there is no difficulty going to negative values inside the horizon . on the other hand in terms of weyl",
    "coordinates , the functions @xmath57 are the square root of a positive number when @xmath58 and imaginary if @xmath59 . clearly , instead of dealing with imaginary values of @xmath60 , the way to go ` beyond ' the special null line @xmath61 is to keep @xmath58 but use the other square root branch for @xmath60 as it enters in the weyl functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 by explicitly replacing @xmath62 .",
    "since we can pass @xmath63 and/or pass @xmath64 , it is clear that the four different branches of the square root functions differentiate the four copies of the weyl triangle .    from ( [ schwarzschildweylrep ] )",
    ", passing each @xmath61 null line changes the sign of @xmath65 and hence exchanges the timelike and spacelike nature of @xmath66 and @xmath22 .",
    "since the vertical direction on a vertical card always represents time , two of the triangles are drawn turned on their sides , their hypotenuses vertical and so timelike .",
    "the four triangles describing the interior of the black hole @xmath67 glue together along the special null lines to fit neatly into a square ; see fig .",
    "[ buildcard6 ] .",
    "because of the unfolding of the triangles , the positive @xmath22-direction on the top triangle ( and any attached horizontal cards ) points in the opposite direction compared to that on the original horizontal card .",
    "the upper vertical cards is thus a square of length @xmath53 .",
    "the bottom of the upper card v1 is the black hole horizon which connects to three other cards in a four card junction .",
    "the right and left edges of this vertical card correspond to @xmath68 and are the boundaries where @xmath69 the @xmath24-circle vanishes .",
    "the top edge of the card represents the @xmath27 curvature singularity .",
    "the second vertical card v2 is built in analogous fashion except the square is built in a downwards fashion towards negative values of @xmath66 .",
    "additionally there is a second horizontal card plane , h2 , identical to h1 at negative values of the @xmath21 coordinate attached to the same horizon along @xmath70 $ ] on the @xmath22-axis .",
    "one typically stops the construction of the schwarzschild spacetime with the above four regions , and considers the @xmath71 part of the metric to be a separate spacetime .",
    "however for reasons which become clear when we look at the reissner - nordstrm and kerr black holes in sections  [ rnsubsub ] and [ kerrsubsec ] , we continue the card diagram past the singularity and attach two horizontal half - plane corresponding to negative - mass ( or @xmath71 ) universes h3 & h4 , and further vertical card above the singularity which is identical to v2 .",
    "the two new horizontal cards each represent negative mass - universes with no horizon and a naked singularity along @xmath33 .",
    "note that although penrose diagrams for the @xmath72 and @xmath71 regions of schwarzschild can not attach together since the singularity is spacelike in one region and timelike in another , cards can naturally attach at this singularity .",
    "the extended card diagram for schwarzschild , shown in fig .",
    "[ fullschwarzcardfig ] , is an infinite array of repeated cards representing positive ( h1,h2 ) and negative ( h3,h4 ) mass universes and inside - horizon regions .",
    "having described the construction of the card diagram for schwarzschild we now turn to general remarks about these card diagrams .",
    "card diagrams can be constructed in general d - dimensions starting from a generalized weyl ansatz including the charged cases discussed in appendix [ eweylapp ] .",
    "horizontal cards are conformally euclidean and represent stationary regions .",
    "vertical cards are always conformally minkowskian and represent regions with ( @xmath14 ) spacelike killing fields . on a vertical card time",
    "is always in the vertical direction and a spacetime point s causal future lies between @xmath73 null lines on the card .",
    "weyl s coordinates certainly go bad at horizons , so these diagrams are not a full replacement for penrose diagrams at understanding causal structure or particle trajectories .",
    "however , it is clear for example from fig .",
    "[ penrose - weyl - comparison ] that two vertical and two horizontal cards attach together in a orthogonal @xmath74-configuration in precisely the sense of the @xmath41-horizon structure of the penrose diagram .",
    "the prototypical horizon is that of the two rindler and two milne wedges of flat space ; this spacetime has two horizontal half - plane cards and two vertical half plane cards that meet along the horizon being the whole @xmath22-axis .",
    "zooming in on a non - extremal horizon of any card diagram yields this rindler / milne picture .",
    "a rod endpoint @xmath75 such as @xmath51 for schwarzschild is a ` focus ' for the weyl diagram and often represents the edge of a black hole horizon or the end of an acceleration horizon on a horizontal card .",
    "generally , multi - black hole weyl spacetimes depend only on distances to foci , such as @xmath60 in the case of schwarzschild @xcite .    to understand that in general it is natural to change the branch of the distance functions , @xmath76 , when crossing the special null line that emanates from the foci at @xmath77 , take some weyl spacetime and imagine moving upwards in a vertical card to meet the special null line where @xmath78 by increasing time @xmath79 for fixed spatial @xmath22 . rearranging @xmath80 as the semi - ellipse @xmath81",
    "we see that a smooth traversal of this semi - ellipse across @xmath78 requires a change in the sign of @xmath76 .    in many of our solutions ,",
    "special null lines are used to reflect vertical triangular cards to create full , rectangular cards . however , in the bonnor - transformed s - dihole geometry of @xcite as well as double killing rotated extremal geometries and parabolic representations of the bubble and s - schwarzschild in sec .",
    "[ thirdcard - poincare ] , the special null lines will serve as conformal boundaries at null infinity @xmath82 .    boundaries of cards indicate where the metric coefficient along a killing ( circle ) direction vanishes .",
    "which circle vanishes is constant over a connected piece of the boundary , even when the boundary turns a right angle onto a vertical card .",
    "furthermore the periodicity to eliminate conical singularities is constant along connected parts of the boundary . for schwarzschild ,",
    "the @xmath24-circle vanishes on both connected boundaries and has periodicity @xmath83 .    although not a full replacement for understanding causal structure , it is interesting to consider geodesic trajectories on card diagrams .",
    "for example when a light ray is incident from a horizontal card onto a horizon ( to enter the upper vertical card ) , it must turn and meet that horizon perpendicularly .",
    "it then appears on the vertical card , again perpendicular to the horizon . only those light rays which go from the lower vertical card to the upper vertical card",
    "directly can meet the horizon rod at a non - right angle ; these rays would touch the vertex of the @xmath41 in a schwarzschild penrose diagram .",
    "when a light ray on a vertical card hits a boundary where a spacelike circle vanishes , it bounces back at the same angle as drawn on the card relative to the perpendicular .",
    "spacetimes with a symmetry group larger than the minimal weyl symmetry can have more than one card diagram representation .",
    "multiple diagrams exist when there is more than one equivalent way to choose @xmath5 killing congruences on the spacetime manifold .",
    "examples we explicitly discuss in sec .",
    "[ bubble - sbrane - subsec ] are the 4d witten bubble and the 4d s - reissner - nordstrm ( s - rn ) which have three card diagrams corresponding to the three types of killing congruences on ds@xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "these different card diagrams are associated for example with global , patched , and poincar coordinates for ds@xmath84 and the different representations will have different applications and reveal different information . on the other hand",
    "the s - kerr solution , whose card diagram is discussed in sec .",
    "[ kerrsubsec ] , has symmetry group @xmath86 and its unique card representation looks like the ` elliptic ' representation of s - rn .",
    "all spacetimes , new and old , in this paper are built from the following card types .",
    "horizontal cards are always half - planes .",
    "they may however have one or more branch cuts which may be taken to run perpendicular to the @xmath22-axis .",
    "undoing one branch cut leads to a horizontal strip with two boundaries ; multiple branch cuts lead to some open subset , with boundary , of a riemann surface .",
    "vertical cards may be noncompact : full planes with or without a pair of special null lines ; half - planes with vertical or horizontal ( horizon ) boundary ; or quarter planes at any @xmath73 orientation .",
    "vertical cards may also be compact : squares with a pair of special null lines ; or 45 - 45 - 90 triangles at any @xmath73 orientation .",
    "all horizontal and vertical boundaries represent where a killing circle vanishes and hence the end of the card .",
    "all @xmath73 null boundaries represent instances of @xmath87 .",
    "it is satisfying that for a variety of spacetimes including those in @xcite , the cards are always of the above rigid types .",
    "there is one basic procedure which can be performed on vertical cards and their corresponding weyl solutions .",
    "it is the analytic continuation @xmath88 , which is allowed since @xmath11 is determined by first order pdes and @xmath65 is real of either sign on vertical cards .",
    "this continuation is equivalent to multiplying the metric by a minus sign and then analytically continuing the @xmath14 killing directions . for charged generalizations of weyl solutions ( see appendix b ) , this procedure does not affect the reality of the 1-form gauge field .",
    "we call this analytic continuation a @xmath11-flip since the way it acts on a card is to geometrically flip it about a @xmath73 null line ( for example , look at the vertical cards in figs .",
    "[ s - rn-3 ] and [ bubblecard3 ] ) .",
    "in this section we construct the card diagrams for a wide assortment of solutions including black holes , bubbles and s - branes .",
    "the card diagrams are shown to be useful in representing continuous changes in the global spacetime structure such as how reissner - nordstrm black holes change as we take their chargeless and extremal limits .",
    "for the superextremal black holes we discuss how to deal with branch points and cuts on horizontal cards . the card diagram",
    "also clearly represents the kerr ring singularity and how traversing the interior of the ring leads to a second asymptotic spacetime .",
    "the 5d black ring solution , associated c - metric type solutions and twisted s - branes are also discussed .",
    "furthermore analytic continuation has an interesting interpretation in terms of card diagrams .",
    "we will describe the effect of analytic continuation on the card diagrams by examining two known analytic continuations of the reissner - nordstrm black hole , the charged bubble and the s0-brane which we also call s - rn .",
    "these time dependent spacetimes each have three card diagram representation and two are obtained via different analytic continuations in weyl coordinates .",

    "the rest of those horizontal cards , regions h3 and h4 , are @xmath71 or equivalently @xmath97 nakedly singular rn spacetimes .    at each horizon ,",
