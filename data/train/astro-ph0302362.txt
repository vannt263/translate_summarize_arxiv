    "through a detailed analysis of type ia supernovae standard candles @xcite , of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite , and of clusters of galaxies @xcite , standard cosmology has homed in on a rather narrow range of allowed cosmological parameters , a range centered around @xmath6 , @xmath7 or so .",
    "while such allowed values are very encouraging for the standard flat inflationary universe model @xcite , they are , at the same time , equally deeply troubling for standard gravity , requiring a fine - tuning of the cosmological constant @xmath8 through as many as 60 to 120 orders of magnitude , with the fits to data being altogether disastrous if a value such as @xmath9 or @xmath10 for @xmath11 were to actually be used .",
    "the currently required value for the cosmological constant associated with an @xmath11 of order one thus poses an extremely severe challenge to the standard cosmological model which has so far stubbornly resisted resolution . however , even without any such resolution , it is nonetheless possible to directly test whether or not nature actually is governed by the fine - tuned value for @xmath8 suggested by the data analysis .",
    "specifically , since the matter density @xmath12 redshifts while the constant @xmath8 does not , as one looks back in redshift the relative strength of the contributions of these components to the cosmological expansion rate will vary .",
    "in particular , since on its own a normal matter density would lead to deceleration while by itself @xmath8",
    "( if taken to be positive - a further ad hoc assumption of the standard paradigm ) would lead to acceleration , their inferred current era relative strengths are such that a net cosmic acceleration is to only be a very late ( @xmath1 ) phenomenon , with the universe having to be decelerating at all higher redshifts .",
    "study of cosmology above @xmath2 can thus serve as a major diagnostic for the standard paradigm . and moreover , as we shall show below",
    ", it can also provide for definitive testing of the fully covariant alternate conformal gravity theory whose cosmology was originally advocated @xcite precisely because it possessed an underlying symmetry , viz .",
    "conformal invariance , which was able to keep the cosmological constant under control , to thereby lead to a cosmological model @xcite which was able to account @xcite for the accelerating universe supernovae data without any fine - tuning at all while being able to naturally accommodate a @xmath8 as large as elementary particle physics suggests . in this paper",
    "then we therefore explore options for cosmology at redshifts greater than one .    with the acquisition of supernovae data at @xmath4 being quite difficult (",
    "currently there is only one @xmath4 supernova , sn 1997ff , for which both an apparent magnitude and redshift have been established @xcite ) , and with it being some time before the space based snap supernovae project will come on line , it is thus necessary to seek alternate techniques to explore @xmath4 cosmology . since data for the very powerful extended frii radio galaxies @xcite are already available out to @xmath5 or so ( and are readily extendable to @xmath13 ) , we thus turn to the standard yardstick technique based on such radio galaxies which has been developed by daly and coworkers @xcite , and explore its implications for cosmology .",
    "even though the technique itself is based on completely conventional theoretical astrophysical ideas , it is nonetheless instructive to validate the technique purely by empirical means .",
    "consequently , we shall first apply the technique to data below @xmath2 , and show complete consistency between its cosmological expectations and those based on the @xmath1 supernovae data themselves .",
    "thus armed , we shall then extend the predictions of the standard yardstick technique out to @xmath5 and explore its ensuing implications for cosmology .",
    "as such , the procedure that we are following here is is a well established one in astronomy , namely to check the validity of a candidate technique against an established one in a given kinematic region , and to then extend the candidate one into a region which the established one does not reach . noting the complementary between the standard yardstick and standard candle techniques , our analysis thus nicely prepares the @xmath14 region for its eventual exploration via future supernovae data .    in sec .",
    "( 2 ) we familiarize the reader with the standard yardstick radio galaxy method , while also presenting a procedure developed jointly with r. a. daly which enables us to conveniently represent the standard yardstick technique predictions in the form of an equivalent apparent magnitude versus redshift plot , to thus make the method readily visualizable . in sec . ( 3 )",
    "we use the standard yardstick technique to test some candidate cosmological models , viz .",
    "the standard inflationary ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) model , the quintessence model @xcite , the rolling scalar field model @xcite , and the cosmological model based on the alternate conformal gravitational theory .",
    "through use of such a wide variety of models we are able to get the broadest possible reading on the interpretation of the data . finally , in sec .",
    "( 4 ) we discuss some implications for conformal gravity of anisotropies in the cmb , another important testing ground for cosmology , and in work done jointly with k. horne , show that in the conformal theory fluctuations which set in at around nucleosynthesis can readily generate the first peak in the anisotropy data .",
    "general use of a standard yardstick for cosmology requires comparing the measured size of some chosen system at a given redshift with an expected size for it at that same redshift .",
    "however , unlike the common intrinsic luminosity type ia supernovae standard candle technique , there does not appear to be any common intrinsically sized family of astrophysical systems which could provide a purely empirical analog of the standard candle technique .",
    "one thus has to resort to theory to determine an expected size , with the radio galaxy method developed by daly and coworkers relying on standard astrophysical theory which is independent of cosmology , and with the study of anisotropies in the cmb using models based on the cosmology itself to determine the requisite expected size .",
    "we discuss the radio galaxy method here and discuss the cmb technique below .",
    "the primary advantage of the radio galaxy method is that in utilizing the properties of very powerful frii classical double radio galaxy sources , one deals with systems that are luminous enough to permit observation out to @xmath5 and beyond , to thus enable us to go beyond the region currently explored by type ia supernovae .",
    "the frii sources consist of an agn that produces two oppositely directed supersonically propagating collimated jets which inject energy into two radio hot spots .",
    "the most powerful and least distorted of these radio sources ( referred to as friib by daly and coworkers ) form an unusually homogeneous population with the average distance between the radio hotspots , @xmath17 , at a given redshift exhibiting a rather small dispersion .",
    "@xmath17 then serves as a requisite measured size , and with these sources subtending a small opening angle @xmath18 at the observer , we can set @xmath19 where @xmath20 is defined by the robertson - walker null geodesic relation @xmath21 .    on assuming that the supersonic flow ( of average rate of growth @xmath22 ) of the friib sources can be described by strong shock physics , and assuming that the total lifetime of the source is related to the beam power , @xmath23 , of the source according to the power law @xmath24 , daly and coworkers show ( see e.g. @xcite ) that the size @xmath25 to which such an friib system will eventually be expected to grow is related to @xmath17 as @xmath26^{\\beta/3 - 1 } \\label{1a}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 , and where @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are specific ( though rather complicated ) functions of observables associated with the friib systems which are given in @xcite .",
    "in order to apply eq .",
    "( [ 1a ] ) to cosmology daly and coworkers assume further that the expected @xmath31 will be universally proportional to the measured average size @xmath17 of all of the sources in the parent sample which are at the same redshift as the given source , i.e. that the ratio @xmath32 is a redshift independent constant @xmath33",
    ". is unimportant .",
    "what matters for the technique is that @xmath33 be independent of redshift , something which is borne out in the fits .",
    "] at the present time a parent population of 70 friib radio galaxies has been identified , with 20 of the sources having been observed in detail . the full 70 source parent sample is thus used to determine @xmath17 , while values for @xmath31 are determined from the well studied 20 sources . even though none of the assumptions which go into this analysis is particularly contentious or unreasonable , nonetheless regardless of the validity of its theoretical underpinnings ,",
    "the radio galaxy standard yardstick technique can be considered independently verified by the successful comparison between the @xmath1 radio galaxy and supernovae data given below , a comparison which provides fitted values for the phenomenological @xmath34 and @xmath33 .",
    "application of the theory to data requires the specification of a global cosmological model based on a theory of gravity . for standard gravity with a set of perfect fluid sources each with an equation of state @xmath56 and with an @xmath57 parameter given by @xmath58 ,",
    "the coordinate distance is given in the canonical @xmath59 universe case by the familiar @xmath60^{1/2}}~~ , ~~\\sum_i \\omega_i=1~~. \\label{7a}\\ ] ] eq .",
    "( [ 7a ] ) encompasses not only a standard inflationary universe with a @xmath61 , @xmath62 matter fluid and a @xmath63 , @xmath64 cosmological constant , but also a quintessence model with a matter fluid and an @xmath65 quintessence fluid whose @xmath66 is negative . with slight adjustment eq .",
    "( [ 7a ] ) can also be applied to the rolling scalar field model @xcite , with its power law potential @xmath67 leading to a @xmath68 parameter which then depends on @xmath53 .    as well as study the standard theory",
    ", we shall also explore the fully covariant alternate conformal gravitational theory , a theory which sets out to solve some of the most troubling problems in astrophysics , viz .",
    "the cosmological constant and dark matter problems , by modifying gravity rather than by making ad hoc adjustments to the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "while the conformal theory is found to recover the results of standard gravity for solar system sized distances or less , its departure from the standard theory on larger distance scales has enabled it to naturally resolve the dark matter and dark energy problems without any fine - tuning at all , with its only known difficulty ( a point we return to below ) being an inability to nucleosynthesize sufficient primordial deuterium .    in the conformal theory",
    "it is found that even while the low energy limit of the theory is controlled by a dynamically induced but otherwise standard attractive newton constant @xmath69 , its cosmology is controlled by an entirely different induced gravitational constant @xmath70 , a repulsive rather than attractive coupling constant which is given as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the ( very large ) expectation value of a scalar urfield which is to spontaneously break the conformal symmetry cosmologically . apart from this specific change the cosmological evolution equation is otherwise completely standard , taking ( for a matter density which redshifts as @xmath73 ) the form @xcite @xmath74 ~,~~q(t)=(n/2 - 1)\\bar{\\omega}_m(t)-\\bar{\\omega}_{\\lambda}(t ) \\label{8a}\\ ] ] with @xmath57 having been replaced by @xmath75 .",
    "moreover , in the conformal theory the sign of the parameter @xmath8 is explicitly known to necessarily be negative since it arises from elementary particle physics phase transitions which occur as the universe cools down , i.e. by transition from an unbroken symmetry phase with @xmath76 to a broken one with a lower energy .",
    "then , with @xmath70 also being negative , it follows that @xmath77 itself must necessarily be positive .",
    "moreover , with @xmath78 necessarily being negative precisely because @xmath70 is negative , it follows that @xmath79 is then always negative , with conformal cosmology thus automatically being an accelerating one in each and every epoch no matter how big or small @xmath8 might be . as regards the numerical value of @xmath77 , we note further that the larger @xmath72 the smaller @xmath70 , and thus the smaller the amount by which the cosmological constant gravitates .",
    "thus in the conformal theory it is not the cosmological constant which gets quenched but rather its effect on cosmic evolution , with the amount of gravity produced by a matter source being radically reduced from the amount generated by the same source in the standard theory .",
    "moreover , this quenching is done by the theory itself without the need for any fine - tuning , leading to a theory in which no matter how huge @xmath8 might be , @xmath77 always @xcite has to lie between zero and one in all epochs except the very earliest ( the only epoch where @xmath80 is of consequence even though @xmath81 contains the completely standard amount of luminous material ) , with the late universe deceleration parameter being given as @xmath82 , so that at late times @xmath79 then has to automatically lie between zero and minus one no matter what .",
    "the theory thus gives a controlled amount of cosmic acceleration in each and every late universe epoch without any fine - tuning at all , with it being the absence of any decelerating epoch above @xmath2 which serves as a clear discriminator between it and the standard theory .",
    "( [ 8a ] ) , the conformal theory coordinate and luminosity distances are then found to be given by @xcite @xmath83~~ , \\label{9a}\\ ] ] to thus give a one parameter family of fits labelled by the current value of @xmath84 , a value which , as we just noted , has to necessarily lie between zero and minus one .",
    "given eqs .",
    "( [ 7a ] ) and ( [ 9a ] ) we turn now to the data .",
    "for the supernovae data we follow the authors @xcite and fit 38 of their 42 reported data points together with 16 of the 18 earlier lower @xmath53 points of @xcite , for a total sample of 54 @xmath1 supernovae data points .",
    "( while we thus leave out 6 questionable supernovae data points for the fitting , nonetheless , for completeness we still include them in the displayed fig . 1 . ) for the radio galaxies we use the 14 data points listed in @xcite and the 6 listed in @xcite , for a total of 20 radio sources . of the models for which we provide fits below , the implications for the radio galaxy data of three of them",
    "have already been well studied in the literature by daly and coworkers , with the standard model radio galaxy predictions having been given in @xcite , the quintessence model predictions in @xcite and the scalar field model predictions in @xcite .",
    "fits to the supernovae data using the standard model and the quintessence model abound in the literature , with supernovae fits using the scalar field model having been given in @xcite , and supernovae fits using conformal cosmology having been given in @xcite .",
    "as far as all of those published fits are concerned what is new here is only in the way the fits are organized in the tables below , excepting that the conformal cosmology radio galaxy fits are new .    for the @xmath59 standard model fitting to the supernovae data we recover the results of @xcite , and obtain a minimum @xmath85 with @xmath86 , @xmath87 , with the 68% confidence region being given as @xmath88 , @xmath89 ( see table 1 , where our identification of 51 rather than 52 degrees of freedom is due to an internal aspect of the data extraction procedure used in @xcite ) .",
    "of the 20 radio sources 9 have @xmath90 , and a fit to them alone yields a best fit @xmath91 .",
    "combining now the two @xmath1 data sets then yields a best fit @xmath92 for the 63 points with @xmath1 , where now the minimum is at @xmath93 , @xmath94 , with the 68% confidence region being given as @xmath88 , @xmath89 . noting the complete overlap of the fitting parameters and noting that @xmath95 is extremely close to @xmath96 , we thus find complete compatibility between the cosmologies implied by the @xmath1 supernovae and radio galaxy data . and",
    "with this very same concordance being found in the @xmath1 analyses of all of the other cosmological models being considered here , we believe that one may therefore regard the standard yardstick technique as having been empirically confirmed .",
    "having established the credentials of the radio source technique , we now include the 11 radio galaxies with @xmath4 and make an overall standard model fit to all 74 of the @xmath35 data points .",
    "we find a best fit @xmath97 for the 74 points with @xmath35 , where now the minimum is at @xmath93 , @xmath94 , with the 68% confidence region being given as @xmath88 , @xmath89 . with a best fit @xmath98 being found for the 20 radio galaxy data points alone and with @xmath99 being within one standard deviation of @xmath100 , we again find complete compatibility between the standard yardstick and standard candle approaches .    in an examination of the fits",
    "it was found that a huge amount of the @xmath101 was contributed by just one radio galaxy , viz .",
    "3c 427.1 at @xmath102 , an outlier which is more than 3 @xmath103 away from the best fits .",
    "consequently , we also investigated fits to the data with this potentially questionable source removed , with the resulting outcome for the standard inflationary cosmology being listed in table 5 and displayed in fig .",
    "1 as an equivalent apparent magnitude fit and then in fig .",
    "2 as a residual equivalent apparent magnitude fit with respect to the convenient empty universe baseline . ,",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath44 as given in column 5 of table 5 .",
    "( details of this error bar analysis are given in @xcite . ) ] with the plot of the altogether acceptable fitting of eqs .",
    "( [ 4a ] ) - ( [ 6a ] ) to the data being shown in fig . 1 , we believe that this figure can reasonably be interpreted as an early look at the @xmath35 hubble diagram .    for comparison purposes we have also included in fig .",
    "1 a plot of the apparent magnitude expectations associated with the illustrative ( @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 ) , ( @xmath107 , @xmath105 , @xmath108 ) , and ( @xmath107 , @xmath109 , @xmath106 ) models ( as calculated from eq . ( [ 6a ] ) with @xmath110 ) .",
    "the curvature dominated ( @xmath107 , @xmath105 , @xmath108 ) empty universe is a coasting one with @xmath79 being zero in all epochs , and is thus a particularly convenient baseline , a point we emphasize in the residual magnitude plot with respect to it given in fig .",
    "as we see , the ( @xmath93 , @xmath94 ) model apparent magnitude crosses this baseline at around @xmath111 , and @xmath11 the parameter @xmath112 can change sign at a much lower redshift than the one at which @xmath113 would cross the empty universe baseline . ] a somewhat higher ( rather than lower ) value than the @xmath114 value where an ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 ) universe would cross , to thus indicate that no compelling case from the radio galaxy data can be made that the @xmath4 region is any less cosmically repulsive than the @xmath1 region . additionally in the figures we have included the sn 1997ff data point at @xmath115 , and we see that the radio sources ( and particularly the radio sources at the highest available redshifts ) are not supporting its suggestion that cosmic repulsion is in fact weakening above @xmath2 .",
    "as regards sn 1997ff , we additionally recall that the authors of @xcite had noted that this particular supernova just happened to be lensed by two foreground galaxies along the line of sight , so it might well be a lot dimmer than indicated in the figures , an effect which would then move it more toward the cosmically repulsive side of the empty universe baseline . from fig .",
    "2 we additionally infer that by extending the hubble diagram out just a little bit further in @xmath53 , it should then rapidly become apparent whether the standard model @xmath111 crossover is supported by higher @xmath53 data .",
    "moreover , even without this , filling in the @xmath35 region with more data points could itself already sharply constrain cosmology .",
    "we have also made fits to the data using a quintessence model , a scalar field model and a conformal cosmology model , and display their best fits in tables 2 , 3 and 4 ( 3c 427.1 included ) and tables 6 , 7 and 8 ( 3c 427.1 excluded ) , and plot their best outlier excluded fits in figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "parameter to the range @xmath116 , and the scalar potential parameter @xmath117 to the range @xmath118 . ] as we see , both the quintessence model fitting and the scalar field model fitting are every bit as acceptable as the standard ( @xmath119 , @xmath16 ) model fitting , with their best @xmath4 fits also not being found to be any less cosmically repulsive than those for @xmath1 ( if anything both of the models go in the direction of making @xmath119 smaller ) .",
    "this suggestion of a potentially continuing cosmic repulsion above @xmath2 is also shared by the conformal gravity fits , fits which are just as good as the standard model and quintessence fits while being strictly on the repulsive side of the empty universe baseline at all @xmath53 .",
    "the conformal gravity fitting to the 74 total data points which we present here is completely consistent not only with the earlier conformal gravity fitting to the 54 @xmath1 supernovae data points given in @xcite , but also with the @xmath4 predictions made in the same paper ; with the very success of the conformal gravity fitting that we have presented here implying that it is not yet possible to ascertain whether the universe is actually accelerating or decelerating between @xmath2 and @xmath5 , level of acceptability . ] thus making any extension or filling in of the hubble diagram potentially highly instructive .",
    "the conformal gravity fits are also significant in that at the present time they are in fact the only non fine - tuned fits to the accelerating universe data that have so far been presented in the literature , to thus at the very least show that it is in principle possible to fit the data without fine - tuning , with the currently available @xmath3 data not at all rejecting the only predictive cosmological model presented so far in the literature in which the cosmological constant problem is naturally solved .",
    "other than the @xmath3 region , the two other primary regions where cosmology can be tested are the nucleosynthesis era and the cmb recombination era , studies of which lead in the standard theory to remarkably successful fitting associated with an @xmath120 , @xmath7 universe .",
    "as we had indicated earlier such a universe can directly be tested in the @xmath0 region . however , because it might be some time yet before a definitive answer to such testing is actually obtained , and because the cosmological constant problem associated with such an @xmath120 , @xmath7 universe is so very severe , it is of value to ask whether the cmb anisotropy data could admit of any alternate explanation . as well as",
    "a being posed simply as a general question ( namely , how much of the success of the cmb fitting is due to detailed features of a particular model and how much might be generic ) , one can also ask how well any candidate alternate theory might fare . while the cosmological fluctuation theory associated with the alternate conformal gravity theory being considered in this paper",
    "has yet to be fully developed , a first step in this regard has recently been taken by the author and k. horne , one we now report on .",
    "basic to the cmb analysis is a determination of the true proper diameter @xmath121 of some candidate yardstick at coordinate @xmath20 and redshift @xmath122 which subtends an angle @xmath18 at an observer at @xmath123 , @xmath124 , a proper diameter which for a general robertson - walker geometry is given by @xmath125 and which for small @xmath18 reduces to the relation @xmath126 used earlier for the radio galaxies .",
    "if the yardstick used for the cmb analysis is due to the growth of some cosmological fluctuation which started at some earlier fluctuation time @xmath127 , the proper distance @xmath128 of the fluctuation at the time @xmath129 will be given by @xmath130 so that a comparison of the measured @xmath121 with a model choice for @xmath128 allows one to test and constrain the chosen model .",
    "since the treatment of the isotropy of the cmb in the conformal theory differs substantially from the discussion in the standard theory ( the conformal cosmology cmb derived from eq .",
    "( [ 8a ] ) is already causally connected @xcite even without any inflationary phase ) , it is instructive to first recall the standard model discussion . with the largest possible value for @xmath128 being given by a fluctuation which set out at @xmath131 , for a standard @xmath59 cosmology which is radiation dominated ( @xmath132 ) until recombination , at recombination the maximum @xmath133",
    "is then given as @xmath134 .",
    "similarly , for a @xmath59 standard cosmology which is matter dominated ( @xmath135 ) since recombination , @xmath136 is given as @xmath137 , with the ratio @xmath138 thus being very much less than one .",
    "thus despite the high isotropy found for the cmb , in a @xmath59 robertson - walker universe opposite points on the cmb sky would not be causally connected , with the angle @xmath139 subtended on the sky by @xmath140 being of order only @xmath141 . in the standard theory",
    "this causality problem is solved by having an inflationary de sitter phase occur very early in the history of the universe prior to the onset of the robertson - walker phase .",
    "this inflationary phase not only reconciles the causality conflict , it also converts what was a considerable difficulty into a potentially considerable triumph , since the very same @xmath140 then no longer sets the scale for the isotropy of the cmb , but rather for its anisotropy as caused by fluctuations generated during the very same inflationary era . with the detection of an anisotropic peak in the cmb associated with precisely such a @xmath141 scale , it is now taken as a given that the fluctuations which are seen in the cmb must indeed have originated in the very early universe , with the very success of inflation in describing the cmb leading one to conclude that the spatial 3-curvature of the universe is having a negligible effect on current era cosmic expansion so that @xmath142 is negligible . , but does not actually fix a value for @xmath143 itself .",
    "what is to then fix the global topology of the universe in the standard theory is yet to be identified .",
    "] however , as we shall now show , in theories such as conformal cosmology whose robertson - walker phase already is causal , an altogether different option is possible .    with only the conformal matter density @xmath78 contributing to the conformal evolution equation eq .",
    "( [ 8a ] ) at temperatures above the phase transition temperature @xmath144 at which the vacuum energy density @xmath8 is induced , and with @xmath70 being negative , we see that eq .",
    "( [ 8a ] ) then only admits of solutions in which @xmath143 is negative , with the global topology of the universe thus being fixed once and for all in the conformal theory prior to the onset of any phase transition at all .",
    "further , with @xmath70 being negative there is no initial singularity in the theory , with the cosmology thus expanding from a finite minimum radius @xmath145 and a finite ( though very large ) maximum temperature @xmath146 .",
    "in such a cosmology we find that at times which are not too early and not too late , the solution to eq .",
    "( [ 8a ] ) can be well approximated as @xcite @xmath147 corresponding to a curvature dominated universe with @xmath148 .",
    "for such an expansion radius we find that at recombination @xmath136 and the horizon size are well approximated as @xmath149 with the theory thus being causally connected since @xmath150 is altogether bigger than @xmath136 .",
    "thus in the conformal theory it will not be fluctuations which start out at @xmath151 which will lead to anisotropies in the cmb , but rather ones which start out at altogether later times , with explicit calculation then showing that the fluctuations ( of angular size @xmath152 when @xmath18 is small ) which will imprint a @xmath141 scale on the cmb would need to set out at a temperature of order @xmath153  @xmath154k , i.e. at just around the time of nucleosynthesis . in the conformal theory",
    "then anisotropies in the cmb are still related to the size of cosmological fluctuations but not to any horizon associated with them , with it thus in principle being possible to produce the position of the first peak in the cmb in theories in which @xmath155 is far from negligible .",
    "the emergence of a nucleosynthesis scale for the onset of fluctuations is not only intriguing , it may also prove to be of help for the conformal theory . specifically , as noted earlier , one of the outstanding challenges for conformal cosmology is that it while it can readily synthesize the requisite amounts of primordial helium and lithium @xcite , it fails to yield the needed amount of deuterium .",
    "specifically , because the cosmology expands at a much slower rate than the standard theory , there is abundant time to destroy any deuterium which is generated during nucleosynthesis , to thus leave the cosmology deuterium deficient .",
    "bottleneck of no stable nuclei with @xmath156 , but to then actually produce the measured amount of @xmath157 @xcite .",
    "] however , as noted by the authors of @xcite , once helium is nucleosynthesized , the setting in of inhomogeneities would lead to helium rich and helium deficient regions whose spallation would then generate deuterium , with deuterium production then occurring between nucleosynthesis and recombination .",
    "the emergence of inhomogeneities toward the end of the nucleosynthesis era might then serve to alleviate the conformal gravity deuterium problem .",
    "development of a full conformal cosmological fluctuation theory would allow one to address this question while also making predictions for the cmb in a way which might then prove definitive for the conformal theory .",
