    "doping of semiconductor crystallites of nanometer size , or quantum dots ( qds ) , allows tuning the transport , electric , optical and magnetic properties for the purpose of tailoring proposed quantum devices @xcite .",
    "incorporation of impurities into qds provides charge carriers that strongly modifies those properties @xcite .",
    "neutral and negatively charged shallow donor impurities ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 centers ) in semiconductors are the analogue of the h atom and the h@xmath4 ion in atomic physics , _",
    "i.e. _ , one and two electrons bonded to a positively charged coulomb center , respectively . in particular , @xmath3 centers are the simplest system where correlation effects can play a role . the binding energy of a @xmath2 center in qds has been studied with different confining potential shapes and calculation methods @xcite .",
    "many of them assume the impurity to be at the center of the qd .",
    "nevertheless , the position of the @xmath2 impurities was shown to strongly affect the binding energy @xcite .",
    "other properties also show such a dependence ; for instance , the calculated optical - absorption spectra of homogeneously distributed @xmath2 centers , show an absorption edge associated with transitions involving impurities at the center of the well and a peak related with impurities next to the edge of the dot @xcite .",
    "also the effect of parabolic confinement on the binding energy of shallow hydrogenic impurities in a spherical qd of a widegap semiconductor , such as gaas , as a function of the impurity position for different dot sizes , was studied @xcite .",
    "the binding energy of an off - center neutral hydrogenic impurity in a spherical quantum dot has been studied by using finite - depth spherical well @xcite and gaussian confining potentials @xcite .",
    "the binding energy @xcite and the energy levels of the ground and the excited states of spin - singlet and spin - triplet configurations have been calculated variationally by assuming a square finite - well confining potential @xcite . since the experimental demostration of the existence of built - in @xmath3 centers in doped multiple quantum wells structures @xcite , a number of works considered the binding energy of on - center negatively charged impurities , under different confining potentials @xcite .",
    "xiew proposed a procedure to calculate energy spectrum of @xmath3 centers in disk - like qds with a parabolic lateral confining potential .",
    "he found that there exists a critical radius @xmath5 , such that if @xmath6 the @xmath3 configuration is stable @xcite .",
    "_ studied the dependence of the binding energy of @xmath2 and @xmath3 centres on the confining potencial shape by using the local density approximation @xcite .",
    "a gaussian confining potential , having finite depth and range , has been suggested as way to take into account effects of non - parabolicity in the qd potential for both one- and few - electron systems @xcite .",
    "the energy spectra of @xmath3 centres in disk - like gaussian quantum dots were calculated in ref .",
    "recently xie calculated the binding energy of an on - center @xmath3 donor in a gaussian potential @xcite and sahin showed that the use of the exchange and correlation potential is necesary , within the the local density approximation of density functional theory , for obtaining correct results @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the binding energy of an off - center @xmath3 impurity in a two - dimensional parabolic qd was addressed by using finite - difference and fractional dimension methods .",
    "+ to our knowledge , the issue of an off - center @xmath3 donor in a spherical qd has not been addressed .",
    "therefore , the purpose of the present work is to study the binding energy of a @xmath3 center in a spherical qd as a function of its position , and to explain this dependence in terms of a simple model .",
    "we consider two electrons bonded to a shallow donor impurity in a spherical qd of radius @xmath7 and depth @xmath8 .",
    "the impurity is located at the position @xmath9 and a gaussian confining potential @xmath10 is assumed for the qd . the hamiltonian , in the effective mass approximation , can be written as @xmath11 + \\frac{1 } { r_{12}},\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the electron - donor coulomb potential .",
    "we use the donor bohr radius @xmath13 as the unit of length and the donor effective atomic unit @xmath14 hartree as the unit of energy .",
    "the binding energy of the @xmath3 center is defined as @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the energy of the neutral impurity @xmath17 in the qd , @xmath18 is the energy of an electron in the qd wihout the impurity , and @xmath19 is the energy of the @xmath3 in the qd .",
    "the energies @xmath16 and @xmath18 of the one - electron systems are calculated by direct diagonalization .",
    "the calculation method was reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the energy @xmath19 of the two - electron system were calculated with the configuration interaction ( ci ) method @xcite , where the eigenvectors of two electron hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) are expanded in terms of the two - electron hartree - fock ground state and its single and doubly excitated configurations ( slater determinants ) , expanded in a single - particle cartesian gaussian basis set @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the angular momentum of the function , and the @xmath22 are properly chosen exponents @xcite .",
    "a basis set @xmath23 centered in the qd , and a @xmath24 basis set centered at @xmath25 , similar to other previously used for describing the weakly bonded h@xmath4 ion and its polarizability , was also added for taking into account the donor center @xcite .",
    "the total spin symmetry of the configurations considered were restricted to @xmath26 as in previous works @xcite .",
    "a potential depth of @xmath27 a.u.@xmath28 was kept throughout the present work .",
    "the binding energy , eq .",
    "( [ def eb ] ) , calculated with the ci method is shown in fig .",
    "[ e_b ] with empty circles as a function of the qd radii @xmath7 .",
    "four impurity positions were considered , namely , @xmath29 and 1.0 @xmath30 .",
    "the results show that for on - center position ( @xmath31 ) @xmath0 is always postive with a maximum nearly @xmath32 .",
    "this maximum binding energy at this critical radius @xmath1 , is related to the fact that for every @xmath8 , there is a minimum @xmath1 where an electron can be stable in the qd @xcite .",
    "this result is in qualitative agreement with previous works that treated on - center @xmath3 donors @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned , however , that they differ from a recent calculation by xie @xcite . at small distances from the potential center ( @xmath33 ) ,",
    "the maximum is less pronounced and there is a minimum at @xmath1 . for larger values of @xmath34 ( 0.6 @xmath30 and @xmath35 ) , there still exists a minimum at @xmath1 , such that the larger @xmath34 , the more negative the minimum becomes while the maximum becomes flatter . also the binding becomes negative for radii @xmath36 , and positive for @xmath37 .",
    "hencefore , the larger @xmath34 , the wider the radii range where the binding energy is negative .",
    "we also preformed hartree - fock calculations , not reported here , whose results show a similar trend .",
    "the correlation energies were found in the range of @xmath38 a.u.@xmath28 for @xmath39 , to @xmath40 a.u.@xmath28 for @xmath41 , and weakly dependent on the impurity position .",
    "the results can be rationalized as follows . for a fixed potential depth and very small radius the effect of",
    "the potential becomes negligible because it can not bind electrons .",
    "so , the two electrons are kept bonded due to the impurity coulomb potential forming a h@xmath4 ion .",
    "the same happens for very large radius , where the bottom of gaussian potential becomes flat and contributtes approximately with a constant potential @xmath42 .",
    "then , @xmath43 a.u .",
    "for both @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    for intermediate radius ( @xmath46 ) , where the dot can allocate electrons ,",
    "the impurity is outside the dot and the system could become instable . for very large radius ( @xmath47 ) , the system behaves like an on - center impurity , thus having a positive binding energy .",
    "a more quantitative explanation of the results can be obtained by using a variational estimate as follows .",
    "consider a normalized @xmath48-type gaussian trial function @xmath49 , centered in the qd center .",
    "the energy of the two - electron @xmath3 center can be obtained as the expectation value of the hartree - fock hamiltonian in the spin - singlet trial state @xmath50 , thus giving @xmath51 + 2\\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha}{\\pi}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the terms within brackets are the expectation value of the kinetic energy @xmath52 , confining potential @xmath53 and the impurity potential @xmath54 for each electron .",
    "the last term is the coulomb repulsion @xmath55 between the gaussian charge densities of each electron .",
    "the optimal exponent @xmath56 is obtained by minimization of eq .",
    "( [ e_dm ] ) . in this way , using the optimal @xmath56 , the ground state energy @xmath19 can be estimated as @xmath57 .",
    "analogously , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "hence , the binding energy is approximately given by @xmath60 , that is , @xmath61 eq .",
    "( [ eb_m ] ) implies that @xmath62 depends directly on the interplay between the nuclear attraction and electron - electron interaction . for @xmath63 ( the limit of on - center impurity ) , @xmath64 and eq .",
    "( [ eb_m ] ) becomes @xmath65 , thus showing that the on - center binding energy is always positive , in agreement with the ci results presented here . on the other hand , for a fixed @xmath7 , as @xmath34 increases ,",
    "@xmath66 , and @xmath55 becomes dominant , thus giving @xmath67 .",
    "the systems for which @xmath67 are not stable and is similar to a molecular dissociation process ending up with one electron in a qd and the other in the @xmath3 .",
    "the results calculated with eq .",
    "( [ eb_m ] ) are shown for comparison in fig .",
    "[ e_b ] with continuous lines .",
    "as can be seen , all qualitative features of the ci curves are well reproduced with this simple model .",
    "it is interesting to point out that the use of the hartree - fock hamiltonian gives an electron - electron interaction @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the exchange energy such that @xmath70 for the doubly occupied ground state .",
    "thus , eq . ( [ e_dm ] ) takes into account the exchange energy correctly .",
    "disregarding the exchange energy would imply to add a factor of two to the last term of eq .",
    "( [ e_dm ] ) , and the binding energy for an on - center impurity would give @xmath71 , in agreement with ref . @xcite .",
    "( [ eb_m ] ) was also used in fig .",
    "[ eb_mf ] to show the change in the binding energy as the impurity moves from the center of the qd up to @xmath72 .",
    "in summary , we have calculated the binding energy of a negatively charged impurity with on- and off - center position in a spherical gaussian quantum dot with the configuraction interaction method .",
    "our calculations show that @xmath0 is always positive for on - center impurities with a maximum near to the radius for one - electron stability of the potential well @xmath1 .",
    "as the impurity is displaced off center , the maximum of @xmath0 decreases and a minimum near to @xmath1 appears . for sufficiently large @xmath34 , @xmath0 assumes negative values indicating the instability of the system .",
    "our results could be useful for understanding how the binding energy is affected by the breaking of the spherical symmetry of the potential well due to doping in low - dimensional systems .    [",
