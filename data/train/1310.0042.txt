    "ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulx , e.g. fabbiano 2004 , roberts 2007 ) are off - nuclear , point - like sources , with luminosity exceeding @xmath2erg s@xmath3 . timing and spectral variability studies yielded sufficient evidence of the majority of them being accreting compact objects .",
    "however , their high luminosity is not easy to reconcile with emission from standard black hole binary ( bhb ) systems . indeed , assuming isotropic emission , the observed x - ray fluxes require either super - eddington accretion onto a stellar mass black hole ( m@xmath4m@xmath5 ) , or sub - eddington accretion onto an intermediate mass black hole ( imbh , i.e. m@xmath6m@xmath5 , e.g. colbert & mushotzky 1999 ) .",
    "alternative explanations imply the enhanced brightness to be due to beamed emission ( king et al 2001 ) .",
    "overall , a combination of mild beaming and moderately super - eddington rate seems to account for the majority of the observed ulxs up to luminosities of @xmath7erg s@xmath3 .",
    "however , the imbh interpretation remains a plausible explanation for the most luminous sources ( feng & soria 2011 and references therein ) .",
    "unfortunately , it has not been possible so far to rely on direct mass estimates , due to the difficulties in detecting the companion star .",
    "thus , the most promising way to deal with the ulx issue is to make use of indirect methods , e.g. by comparing their spectral and timing properties with those of well known accreting x - ray sources ( i.e. bhbs , agns , e.g. casella et al 2008 ) .",
    "+ mass - scaling arguments suggest that the same mechanism can explain the observed spectral and timing properties of accreting objects spanning up to @xmath8 orders of magnitude in mass ( from neutron stars to agn , e.g. merloni , heinz , & di matteo 2003 ; mchardy et al 2006 ; koerding et al 2007 ) . according to this scenario ulxs",
    "are expected to fit in this picture as well , with their specific properties ( e.g. characteristic time scales , disc temperature ) depending on the bh mass .",
    "one of the main observables characterizing x - ray binaries is their accretion state .",
    "x - ray binaries are generally in a quiescent state , occasionally broken up by violent outbursts , during which the spectral and timing properties of the source undergo major changes over relatively short time scales ( belloni 2010 , belloni et al 2011 ) . at the beginning of the outburst the source is in the power law - dominated , low hard state ( lhs ) .",
    "this state spans a large range of x - ray luminosities , and is characterized by a high x - ray variability power and the presence of a jet ( markoff et al 2001 , fender et al 2004 ) .",
    "when the source leaves the hard state it gradually softens , up to the so called disc - dominated , high soft state ( hss ) , during which the x - ray variability power strongly decreases , while the jet is quenched , and the emergence of disc winds is observed ( ponti et al 2012 ) . in between these two canonical states",
    "the source passes through the hard - intermediate ( hims ) and soft - intermediate ( sims ) states , namely transition states mainly characterized by a gradual increase of disc flux fraction , with a corresponding gradual decrease of variability power , and the presence of qpos .",
    "koerding et al ( 2006 ) demonstrated that the concept of accretion states can be applied to agn as well , once the proper scaling to longer time scales is taken into account .",
    "+ it has been observed that the total amount of variability strongly depends on the accretion state of the source and can be used as a good tracer of it ( muoz - darias et al 2011 ) .",
    "ngc 5408 x-1 is a well known ulx , showing remarkable x - ray variability ( heil et al 2009 ) .",
    "moreover , it is one of the few ulxs ( e.g. m82 x-1 , strohmayer & mushotzky 2003 , mucciarelli et al 2006 ) for which the detection of a low - frequency quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) has been reported ( strohmayer et al 2007 , strohmayer & mushotszky 2009 , hereafter s07 and sm09 respectively ) .",
    "the properties of the detected qpo in ngc 5408 x-1 favour an association with the type c qpos ( s07 ) commonly observed in bhbs during lhs and hims ( e.g. casella et al 2004 ) .",
    "such association , combined with simple frequency - scaling arguments , implies ngc 5408 x-1 to host an imbh with m@xmath9m@xmath5 ( e.g. mucciarelli et al 2006 , casella et al 2008 ) .",
    "however , this interpretation is not univocal , and different scenarios have been proposed ( e.g. a m@xmath10 m@xmath5 accreting at super - eddington rate , middleton et al 2011 ) .",
    "+ in this paper we present a comprehensive analysis of the variability and spectral timing properties of ngc 5408 x-1 , and use them as diagnostics of the accretion state of the source .",
    "moreover , we report the detailed study of the soft x - ray time - lag in ngc 5408 x-1 light curves .",
    "we discuss the analogies with soft x - ray lags observed in other accreting bh systems , and derive implications on the bh mass .",
    "we analyzed the six archived ( see table [ log ] ) xmm - newton observations of ngc 5408 x-1 , carried out between january 2006 and january 2011 .",
    ".observation log : i d number , satellite revolution number , date , effective exposure of combined epic pn@xmath11mos1@xmath11mos2 data after selection of good time intervals , and bibliographic references for each data set .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]      the frequency range where the soft lag is detected encompasses the qpo frequencies in ngc 5408 x-1 ( fig . [ lag_pow ] ) .",
    "soft x - ray lags displaying an association with qpos and their harmonics ( we will refer to them as qpo lags ) have been detected in a number of bh x - ray binaries ( e.g. xte j1550 - 564 remillard et al 2002 ; xte j1859 + 226 casella et al 2004 ; grs 1915 + 105 reig et al 2000 ) , and in a couple of neutron stars ( de avellar et al 2013 ) , although it is worth noting that these results are mostly obtained from rxte data , which is not sensitive in the epic - pn soft x - ray band , thus precluding the study of qpo lags at these energies .",
    "+ interestingly , the properties of qpo lags show a dependence on the qpo type .",
    "although the majority are characterized by a hard / positive delay at the fundamental qpo frequency ( casella et al 2004 ) , those associated with type - c qpos can switch to soft / negative values ( e.g. reig et al 2000 ) .",
    "indeed , in a couple of sources the amplitude of type - c qpo lags has been observed to smoothly decrease with increasing qpo frequency and to change from positive to negative ( i.e. from hard to soft delays ) above @xmath122 hz ( grs 1915 + 105 , reig et al 2000 ; xte j1550 - 564 remillard et al 2002 ) . as discussed in the previous section , high frequency type - c qpos",
    "are observed during the softest stages of intermediate states ( e.g. reig et al 2000 , casella et al 2004 ) .",
    "thus , provided the qpo - lag association holds , the observation of a soft lag is naturally expected in ngc 5408 x-1 . + it is worth noting that a similar phase lag trend has been observed also in the continuum around the qpo frequency ( reig et al 2000 ) .",
    "+ consequently , a possible origin for the soft x - ray lag in ngc 5408 x-1 may involve an association with the qpo observed in its psd .",
    "besides , the lag energy dependence reported in this paper ( fig . [ lag_e ] ) is reminiscent of the trend observed in the energy spectra of type - c qpo soft lags ( fig . 4 of reig et al 2000 for the case of grs 1915 + 105 ) .",
    "hence , the properties of the soft lag in ngc 5408 x-1 are in agreement with those characterizing lags associated to type - c qpos in bhbs .",
    "a comparison between the qpo frequency of ngc 5408 x-1 ( @xmath13 mhz ) and the range of frequencies of type - c qpos at which soft lags are observed ( @xmath14 hz ) , yields a scaling factor of @xmath15 for the bh mass .",
    "the same linear scaling factor is implied when comparing the lag amplitudes . for a typical binary system hosting a bh of tens of solar masses",
    ", this would correspond to a rescaled bh mass of the order of @xmath16m@xmath5 for ngc 5408 x-1 , consistent with estimates obtained through other methods ( e.g. casella et al 2008 ) . + nonetheless",
    ", an identification of the qpo observed in ngc 5408 x-1 with the mhz qpos observed in bhbs during bright states ( morgan et al 1997 ) can not be completely excluded based on these results . indeed cui ( 1999 ) demonstrated that the lags associated with mhz qpos in grs 1915 + 105 have a complex behaviour , occasionally resembling the trend we observe in the lag - e spectrum of ngc 5408 x-1 ( fig .",
    "[ lag_e ] ) .",
    "this interpretation would imply super - eddington accretion onto a @xmath17100 m@xmath5 bh ( middleton et al 2011 ) .",
    "+ however , some discrepancies with the qpo - lag association emerge from our analysis .",
    "the qpo - like feature in ngc 5408 x-1 is significantly weaker or undetected in the soft band ( @xmath18kev , see fig .",
    "[ lag_pow ] ) , in agreement with s07 and sm09 .",
    "conversely , a soft lag ( fig . [ lag_e ] ) is significantly detected even at energies @xmath19 kev .",
    "moreover , the soft lag in ngc 5408 x-1 extends over a relatively broad range of frequencies @xmath1 mhz , a factor of @xmath20 broader than the width of the lorentzian used to fit the qpo .",
    "the large error bars at the lower frequency end , and the predominance of poisson noise at the high frequency end , do not allow to rule out an even broader profile .",
    "finally , contrary to what observed ( sect .",
    "[ sect : tlags ] ) the lags should change as the qpo varies .",
    "+ these observational evidences seem to suggest that the delayed response is not only in the qpo component , but rather involves a larger part of the variability continuum , i.e. on a larger range of variability time scales ( as previously noted , delays in the continuum around the qpo have been observed in bhbs as well , e.g. reig et al 2000 ) .",
    "kev and @xmath21 kev averaging over all the archived observations of ngc 5408 x-1.,title=\"fig : \" ] +   kev and @xmath21 kev averaging over all the archived observations of ngc 5408 x-1.,title=\"fig : \" ]      high frequency , soft x - ray lags have been observed in several accreting systems , and interpreted as the signature of reverberation ( e.g. fabian et al 2009 , zoghbi et al 2010 , emmanoulopoulos et al 2011 , uttley et al 2011 ) .",
    "it is thus interesting to test whether the soft lag in ngc 5408 x-1 can have the same origin . in fig .",
    "[ corr_plot ] we report the observed correlation between soft x - ray lags amplitude and bh mass in radio quiet agn ( de marco et al 2013 ) , which has been so far tested over the range @xmath22m@xmath5 of bh masses . in the low mass - end of the plot we added the three points that represent detections of soft x - ray lags in the bhb gx 339 - 4 ( miyamoto et al 1993 , uttley et al 2011 ) , and in the two neutron star x - ray binaries 4u 1608 - 52 and 4u 1636 - 53 ( de avellar et al 2013 ) .",
    "+ the few milliseconds soft lag in gx 339 - 4 has been observed in both a hard state ( uttley et al 2011 ) and an intermediate state ( miyamoto et al 1993 ) of the source , meaning that , if interpreted as thermal reverberation off the accretion disc one must take into account the fact that the disc might be truncated ( kubota & done 2004 , uttley et al 2011 , plant et al 2013 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the soft x - ray lags of few @xmath23s recently reported in the neutron - star x - ray binaries 4u 1608 - 52 and 4u 1636 - 53 are observed at the frequencies of the khz qpos , which might be the signature of keplerian modulation at the inner edge of the accretion disc ( e.g. stella & vietri 1999 , mcclintock & remillard 2006 and references therein ) .",
    "one of the possible scenarios that have been proposed for these lags is that they represent the light travel time between the corona and/or the neutron star surface or boundary layer , and the innermost accretion disc ( de avellar et al 2013 ) .",

    "we note that the distribution of agn data points in the plot is clustered within the range of @xmath261 - 10 r@xmath27 light crossing time , while the lag of gx 339 - 4 is rather consistent with the light crossing time at larger distances ( i.e. of the order of @xmath2650 r@xmath28 ) . assuming a standard accretion disc - corona model ( e.g. haardt & maraschi 1991 ) with a geometrically thin and optically thick disc ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 )",
    ", this suggests the disc to extend down to very short distances from the central bh in the case of radio - quiet agn and the two neutron stars x - ray binaries , while it appears to be truncated at larger distances in the case of gx 339 - 4 ( as suggested by uttley et al 2011 ) , consistent with the latter source being in the canonical lhs . + being the bh mass and disc inner radius of ngc 5408",
    "x-1 unknown we can not infer the position of this ulx in the plot .",
    "however , we note that , for the source to be in an intermediate state ( either along the hard - to - soft or the soft - to - hard transition branch ) the luminosity should be @xmath29 ( maccarone 2003 ) .",
    "this places a constraint on the bh mass of @xmath30 m@xmath5 ( where we assumed @xmath31 erg s@xmath3 , as derived from the _ simpl@xmath32diskbb _",
    "fit , see sect .",
    "[ discus ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", ulxs may be sources accreting close or above the eddington limit . in this case",
    "ngc 5408 x-1 would plausibly have a mass of few solar masses , i.e. similar to the mass of standard stellar mass accreting bhs .",
    "thus we assume a rough lower limit of @xmath33 m@xmath5 .",
    "we report in fig .",
    "[ corr_plot ] ( yellow - shaded box ) this range of mass values .",
    "this is plotted against the observed range soft time lags ( see fig .",
    "[ lag_e ] ) in both the low and high frequency range ( i.e. @xmath34 s ) .",
    "according to this plot , the observed soft lag represents distances of the order of tens - to - hundreds of r@xmath27 for an imbh of @xmath35 m@xmath5 , and distances of @xmath36 r@xmath27 if the bh mass is of the order of @xmath37 m@xmath5 .",
    "if the lag is the signature of reverberation from the accretion disc , then the former hypothesis is more reliable , and in agreement with observations of disc truncation during intermediate states ( e.g. kubota & done 2004 , plant et al 2013 ) . in this case , assuming the source is caught right during the soft - to - hard transition ( thus @xmath38 , maccarone 2003 ) , the bh mass would be of the order of @xmath39 m@xmath5 .",
    "+ on the other hand , for a stellar mass bh , the observed lag amplitudes suggest the reprocessing medium to be at much higher distances , and/or to be much more extended , like for example in the case of a wind ( e.g. gladstone et al 2009 ; middleton et al 2011 ) .",
    "the emergence of an outflow within a given radius in super - critically accreting bhs has been proposed to explain the spectral properties of ulxs ( e.g. poutanen et al 2007 ) as well as the presence of photoionized nebulae observed around some of them ( e.g. kaaret et al 2004 ) . in this case , hard x - rays from the inner regions would be seen through the outflow , with the soft x - ray spectrum being due to emission in the wind .",
    "however , the implications of such a model on the lag spectrum strongly depend on the geometry and properties of the wind , and are hard to predict here .    , @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",

    "we have carried out a comprehensive analysis of the fast x - ray variability and time lags of the ulx ngc 5408 x-1 .",
    "our analysis showed that :    * the source is consistent with being non - stationary over the time interval covered by the analyzed observations ( @xmath265 years ) . *",
    "all the observed variability properties closely resemble those observed during the hard - intermediate state of x - ray binaries . we note that most of the known x - ray binaries undergo outbursts that last for a typical period of some months , after which they return to quiescence . the fact that ngc 5408 x-1 is observed in an intermediate state over a time interval of at least 5 years may reflect the presence of a bh with higher mass ( but note , for example , the peculiar case of the stellar mass bh x - ray binary , grs 1915 + 105 , which has been observed in a bright state since its discovery , e.g. fender & belloni 2004 ) . * confirming results by heil & vaughan ( 2010 ) we report the highly significant detection of a soft lag of few seconds , in the frequency range @xmath43 mhz , whereby variations in the soft x - ray band , 0.3 - 1 kev , lag behind those in the hard x - ray band , 1 - 7 kev .",
    "* provided the lag is associated with the qpo , it displays characteristic properties of soft lags observed at the frequency of type - c qpos in bhbs .",
    "this would imply a scaling factor of @xmath15 on the bh mass , thus favouring an imbh interpretation . *",
    "if the lag is associated with the variations in the continuum , rather than with the qpo component only , it might be either the signature of reverberation off the inner regions of the accretion disc or of reprocessing in a larger scale structure , like a wind . *",
    "the measured lag implies a distance of the primary - to - reprocessed emission regions of 10 - 100 r@xmath44 if the central object is an imbh accreting below the eddington limit ( disc reverberation ) . assuming the source is caught during a soft - to - hard transition ( @xmath38 , maccarone 2003 ) , then the implied value of the bh mass is @xmath45 m@xmath5 . *",
    "the measured lag corresponds to a distance of @xmath46 1000 r@xmath44 for a @xmath37 m@xmath5 bh accreting at high rate ( reprocessing in a wind ) .    if the analogy with soft x - ray lags observed in agn ( de marco et al 2013 ) , in the bhb gx 339 - 4 ( uttley et al 2011 ) and in the two neutron star x - ray binaries 4u 1608 - 52 and 4u 1636 - 53 ( deavellar et al 2013 ) holds , then the hypothesis of an imbh seems more coherent with our overall results , and implies a truncation radius of the order of tens - to - hundreds of r@xmath27 . in this case , the observed soft lag in ngc 5408 x-1 would fit in an unified picture , which links the soft x - ray lag properties in sources spanning about 8 orders of magnitude in bh mass . + it is interesting to note that intensive _ swift _",
    "monitoring of the source suggests the presence of dips in the x - ray light curves ( pasham & strohmayer 2013 , gris et al 2013 ) .",
    "the nature of these dips is not yet clear , but it might imply that the system is observed almost edge - on . high inclination",
    "bh x - ray binaries have been demonstrated to show higher observed inner disc temperatures than low inclination systems , i.e. @xmath47 kev ( muoz - darias et al 2013 ) .",
    "our best fit values of the inner disc temperature ( i.e. @xmath48 kev , as obtained from the fit with the _",
    "phabs@xmath32simpl@xmath32diskbb _ model ) are a factor @xmath46 4 lower ( although note that gladstone et al 2009 argue that this observed cool temperature might not be associated with direct emission from the disc ) , thus implying a limit of m@xmath49 m@xmath5 for the bh mass ( e.g. miller et al 2004 ) , in line with the imbh interpretation .",
    "+ it is however important to remark that , despite the variability properties of the source are well in agreement with those characterizing x - ray binaries during hims , the spectral properties remain puzzling . in particular , in our computation of the disc fraction we discarded the presence of a turn over at e@xmath46 4 - 6 kev , since it does not affect significantly the analyzed range of energies .",
    "however this feature may represent the signature of a warm , optically thick corona ( e.g. gladstone et al 2009 ) , which is a peculiar feature of some ulxs and is rarely observed in x - ray binaries ( e.g. ueda , yamaoka & remillard 2009 ) .",
    "although standard models ( e.g. reflection , caballero - garca & fabian 2010 ) have been shown to fit equally well the data , the correct interpretation is still a matter of debate .",

    "<S> we present the analysis of the x - ray variability and spectral timing properties of the ultraluminous x - ray source ( ulx ) ngc 5408 x-1 , one of the most variable ulxs known so far . </S>",
    "<S> the variability properties are used as a diagnostic of the accretion state of the source and to derive estimates of the black hole ( bh ) mass . the observed high level of fast x - ray variability ( fractional root - mean - square variability  </S>",
    "<S> _ rms _  amplitude of @xmath0 percent in the hard energy band ) , the hardening of the fractional _ rms _ spectrum , and the properties of the qpo , all resemble those of a source in a hard - intermediate accretion state . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm the previous detection of a soft lag in the x - ray light curves of the source during 2006 and 2008 observations and find that the soft lag is still present in the more recent 2010/2011 observations . using the entire available xmm - newton data set ( public as of february 2012 ) we observe that the soft lag ( of few seconds amplitude ) is detected over a relatively large range of frequencies ( @xmath1 mhz ) , which always includes the qpo frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> the soft lag displays energy - dependence , with the ( absolute ) amplitude increasing as a function of energy separation . </S>",
    "<S> we find close analogies with soft lags associated to type - c qpos in bh binary systems ( although an association to other types of qpos can not be completely excluded ) , as well as with reverberation lags observed in agn . in both cases an intermediate mass bh ( imbh ) </S>",
