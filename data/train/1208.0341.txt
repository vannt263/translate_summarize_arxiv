    "massive galaxies in the nearby universe are generally comprised of quiescent elliptical and s0 galaxies .",
    "the formation of such massive galaxies has been an active area of study .",
    "recent observations suggest that the properties of these quiescent galaxies ( qgs ) were much different at earlier times .",
    "for example , the sizes of qgs have been found to be much smaller , at fixed stellar mass , at high redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this implies much higher mass densities within the effective radius for qgs at high redshift .",
    "the size measurements are robust @xcite and the stellar mass measurements are in good agreement with dynamical mass estimates @xcite , confirming the dense nature of qgs at high redshift .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the growth in sizes among qgs ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "recent discussions have centered on the relative importance of major and minor dissipationless mergers with the latter favored to be the primary channel for size growth ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while evidence is emerging that these compact qgs represent the cores of local ellipticals @xcite , the progenitors of these compact qgs at even higher redshifts remain a mystery .    selecting galaxy samples at or above a fixed stellar mass limit",
    "has provided important insight into the evolution in properties for such populations . however , the connection to the evolution of a typical galaxy over cosmic time is not straightforward given that galaxies grow in stellar mass due to in situ star formation and merging : the progenitors of galaxies that lie just above a stellar mass limit at low redshift would not be counted in a census of high redshift galaxies above the same mass limit since they were likely to be less massive . measuring the structural evolution of a galaxy as it grows in mass",
    "therefore requires a method for linking its progenitors and descendants over cosmic time .",
    "one such method involves selecting galaxies at a constant cumulative number density .",
    "the basic principle behind this method is that the rank ordering of galaxy masses does not change drastically over time .",
    "therefore , if one selects the 10th most massive galaxy in a comoving volume at @xmath2 , it is still likely to be approximately the 10th most massive galaxy in that comoving volume at @xmath10 , but with a higher overall mass due to star formation and merging .",

    "meanwhile , at @xmath146 , the axis ratio is @xmath158 , closer to what is expected for elliptical galaxies .",
    "this value is in good agreement with sdss studies of massive qgs at @xmath146 @xcite . at the highest redshifts ( @xmath77 ) , the residuals to the single component srsic profile fits are smooth and visual inspection of these residuals suggests that the lower axis ratios at high redshift are not generally driven by multiple components .",
    "in addition , varying the number density selection to lower values , such as @xmath159  mpc@xmath1 , does not impact the general decreasing trend of the median axis ratios towards higher redshifts .",
    "finally , as seen in figure  [ fig_cumnum_structure](c ) the axis ratios of sfgs are generally lower than that of qgs at a given redshift and sfgs increasingly become the dominant population at @xmath57 .",
    "the axis ratios therefore also indicate , in addition to the srsic indices , that the stars in the progenitors of @xmath21 galaxies were distributed in disks at @xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ fig_psncum ] shows example postage stamps of galaxies selected at @xmath8 at different redshifts . for illustrative purposes , we selected galaxies with structural parameters that follow the general trends seen in figure  [ fig_cumnum_structure ] but with more consideration for the trend in axis ratios .",
    "each postage stamp is @xmath160  kpc on a side and note that the size of the galaxy in each redshift bin is larger than the psf .",
    "the relative sizes between redshift bins are therefore easy to compare in this figure when paired with the indicated half - light ellipses . toward lower redshifts , especially at @xmath13 , figure  [ fig_psncum ] shows how light is added to the outer parts , leading to the increasing size and srsic index of galaxies selected at @xmath8 . at higher redshifts , the axis ratios decrease , suggesting a larger contribution from disks .    synthesizing the structural information above with the star formation activity discussed in section  [ sec_cumnum_uvj ] , we see that the progenitors of @xmath21 galaxies at @xmath2 were star - forming disks with @xmath15  kpc .",
    "by @xmath20 , many of these star - forming disks disappear and give rise to a population of compact qgs . by @xmath10 ,",
    "these compact qgs evolved into the large - sized , bulge dominated , quiescent @xmath21 galaxies .      a more intuitive view of how the change in structural properties has impacted the evolution of galaxies at @xmath0  mpc@xmath1  is given by the evolution of the mass surface density profiles in figure  [ fig_cumnum_mass_profile](a ) .",
    "in order to compute these profiles , we first used the best fitting srsic index and effective radius for each galaxy to determine the light profile using the standard formula for a srsic profile :    @xmath161 ) , \\label{eq_sersic}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath162 is the surface brightness at radius @xmath163 , @xmath66 the half - light radius , @xmath164 the surface brightness at @xmath66 , @xmath65 the srsic index , and @xmath165 a constant that depends on @xmath65 .",
    "@xcite find that the surface brightness profiles of galaxies at high redshift generally follow srsic profiles quite well . for simplicity",
    ", we therefore use the analytic representation of the profile for each galaxy .",
    "these light profiles were converted into mass profiles by normalizing the integrated light in the srsic profile to the stellar mass of each galaxy .",
    "note that this conversion neglects radial gradients in the mass - to - light ratio . for a given redshift bin ,",
    "the median of the mass profiles was computed at each radius resulting in the profiles shown in figure  [ fig_cumnum_mass_profile](a ) . the uncertainty in the median of the mass profile at a given radius",
    "was computed by bootstrapping the sample .",
    "we note that one - dimensional srsic fits to these median profiles recover the srsic index and half - light radius to within @xmath166 of the median values reported in table  [ table_ncum ] .",
    "a naive interpretation of figure  [ fig_cumnum_structure](b ) would be that the bulges of galaxies grow in time given the increase in the srsic index , a crude proxy for the bulge - to - disk ratio ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the mass profiles in figure  [ fig_cumnum_mass_profile](a ) generally overlap at small radii and diverge at large radii , suggesting a buildup of mass in the outer parts of the galaxy with time .",
    "figure  [ fig_cumnum_mass_profile](b ) shows the cumulative proportion of mass assembled at different radii relative to the total mass within @xmath167  kpc of the median galaxy at @xmath146 .",
    "roughly @xmath168 of the total mass of the galaxy is assembled within @xmath169  kpc at @xmath146 , as expected given that @xmath147  kpc at that redshift . at @xmath170 , the assembled mass within @xmath169",
    "kpc is @xmath171 of the total mass at @xmath146 indicating that much of the mass within @xmath169  kpc was already in place @xmath172  gyr ago .",
    "note that the small sample in the @xmath56 bin likely leads to this curve falling slightly above the @xmath173 data at @xmath174  kpc .    in figure  [ fig_cumnum_mass_rinout ]",
    ", we compare the mass growth between the central and outer regions of galaxies selected at @xmath0  mpc@xmath1 .",
    "the total stellar mass as a function of redshift is shown by the black line , while the projected mass inside and outside of @xmath175  kpc is given by the red and blue lines , respectively .",
    "these values are determined by integrating equation  ( [ eq_sersic ] ) as follows :    @xmath176    where @xmath177 and @xmath178 are the inner and outer radii enclosing the mass , @xmath179 . for the central regions ( @xmath180  kpc , @xmath181  kpc )",
    ", the stellar mass appears to grow from @xmath2 to @xmath11 but then levels off around @xmath182  @xmath28 .",
    "in contrast , in the outer regions ( @xmath183  kpc , @xmath184  kpc ) mass continues to build up over the entire redshift range studied , growing by a factor of @xmath9 .",
    "the stellar mass that has been added to the outer parts of galaxies over time is therefore the dominant source of assembled mass , as the central parts appear to have been assembled by @xmath11 .",
    "increasing the value of @xmath177 so as to avoid the central regions of the srsic fit ( e.g. , @xmath185  kpc ) , which can be less secure , does not qualitatively impact the latter result .",
    "the results above are in qualitative agreement with those of @xcite .",
    "an alternative projection of figure  [ fig_cumnum_mass_rinout ] is shown in figure  [ fig_cumnum_radii_fixedmass ] .",
    "this figure shows the radius enclosing a given stellar mass as a function of redshift ( analogous to figure  1 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for galaxies at @xmath0  mpc@xmath1 .",
    "it is the equivalent of taking horizontal cuts in figure  [ fig_cumnum_mass_profile](b ) , and scaling by a stellar mass .",
    "the figure therefore depicts the evolution in the `` onion layering '' of stellar mass .",
    "the lines of constant mass terminate in high - redshift bins where the given mass had not yet been assembled .",
    "below @xmath13 , the radius enclosing a given mass remains roughly constant .",
    "this again highlights that new stellar mass growth below @xmath13 occurs at larger radii and that the mass within the inner parts remains roughly unchanged . between @xmath2 and @xmath11 , the radius enclosing a given stellar mass appears to decrease by roughly a factor of @xmath45 .",
    "in section  [ sec_cumnum ] , we have shown that as a galaxy grows in stellar mass by a factor of @xmath9 from @xmath186  @xmath28  at @xmath105 to @xmath106  @xmath28  at @xmath10 , most of the new stellar mass that is added contributes toward mass growth at larger radii as one moves toward lower redshifts .",
    "the mass profiles presented in figure  [ fig_cumnum_mass_profile ] highlight this point as they show that most of the mass in the core is in place by @xmath11 . below @xmath11 ,",
    "figure  [ fig_cumnum_mass_rinout ] shows how mass growth continues in the outer parts to the present epoch . as a consequence ,",
    "the effective radius of the galaxy grows from @xmath187  kpc at @xmath188 to @xmath189  kpc at @xmath10 .",
    "fitting the mass and effective radius evolution at @xmath13 , we find that @xmath190 , which is almost exactly the relation found in @xcite at @xmath191 .    the high resolution of the _ hst _ imaging allowed us to probe the mass distribution of galaxies at @xmath102 at very small radii .",
    "this was not possible in the @xcite study as it relied on ground - based imaging . with the higher resolution _ hst _ imaging , we find that the mass within @xmath175  kpc , which is roughly the median effective radius for a galaxy selected at @xmath8 at @xmath102 , remains roughly constant at @xmath13 .",
    "thus , there does not appear to be any substantial growth at @xmath13 in the central part of the bulge that will characterize this galaxy at @xmath10 . from @xmath2 to @xmath11 , there is evidence for mass growth in the inner part of the galaxy , as seen in figures  [ fig_cumnum_mass_rinout ] and [ fig_cumnum_radii_fixedmass ] .",
    "we note , however , that selecting galaxies at different values of @xmath8 can result in a more constant enclosing radius across redshift for a given mass .",
    "larger samples at @xmath102 may help in clarifying the potential mass buildup in the inner parts of galaxies at those early times .",
    "dissipationless minor mergers are thought to play a significant role in the buildup of mass for qgs .",
    "in addition , such processes are predicted to assemble mass at large radii , thereby contributing toward the size growth of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "for example , using a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation , @xcite suggest that a @xmath10 galaxy with @xmath106  @xmath28  grew by a factor of @xmath9 after @xmath2 , primarily through dry minor mergers .",
    "this mass growth is almost exactly what is found in this work for the same mass descendant at @xmath10 . over this 11  gyr timespan ,",
    "the galaxy grew in size by a factor of @xmath192 , also in agreement with our results .",
    "one caveat in this comparison is that the overall sizes of the simulated galaxy are a factor of @xmath193 lower than what is found in this work .",
    "with more recent simulations , @xcite show that the relation @xmath194 ( see also , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , found in this work and in @xcite , is most easily reproduced by @xmath195 mergers with mass ratios of 1:5 .",
    "in contrast , major mergers lead to a close to linear dependence of @xmath66 on @xmath179 , which is not supported by the observations .",
    "it remains to be seen whether these mergers are actually observed ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      in the local universe ,",
    "the most massive systems are generally bulge dominated elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with large effective radii ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this work and in @xcite",
    ", we showed that the progenitors of these local ellipticals at @xmath196 , are primarily compact qgs . as discussed in the previous section , these compact qgs",
    "are generally considered the cores of ellipticals at @xmath10 ( see also , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , growing in mass and size potentially through dissipationless minor mergers to match the properties , namely sizes , of local ellipticals .    with the _ hst _ imaging and the deep - ir uds data , our number density selection allows us to the trace the properties of progenitors of local ellipticals to @xmath2 .",
    "at these redshifts , figures  [ fig_uvj_ncum ] and [ fig_cumnum_qg_frac ] show that most of the progenitors are sfgs .",
    "the srsic indices in figure  [ fig_cumnum_structure](b ) suggest that these sfgs have exponential profiles , which is typically associated with the surface brightness profiles of disks .",
    "the srsic index alone , however , is not definitive in defining the shapes of these progenitors at @xmath2 .",
    "instead , the most compelling evidence comes from the axis ratios shown in figure  [ fig_cumnum_structure](c ) . at @xmath10",
    ", galaxies selected at @xmath0  mpc@xmath1  have median observed axis ratios of @xmath197 .",
    "the implied intrinsic axis ratio is roughly 2:3 @xcite , indicative of spheroidal systems .",
    "meanwhile , at @xmath2 , figure  [ fig_cumnum_structure](c ) shows that galaxies at @xmath8 have a median axis ratio of @xmath17 .",
    "this value for the axis ratio is very low considering that for a population of randomly oriented , infinitely thin disks , the median axis ratio would be @xmath198 .",
    "it is therefore likely that the progenitors of massive , quiescent , local elliptical galaxies at @xmath2 are star - forming disks . many of the star - forming disks at @xmath2 disappear over the redshift range @xmath151 and give way to compact qgs , as seen in figure  [ fig_uvj_ncum ] .",
    "while the details of this transition require further investigation , we note that for a much broader mass range than what is considered here , @xcite identify a subset of the star forming population at @xmath89 with similar structure to that of compact qgs ( see also , * ? ? ?",
    "we used _ hst _ imaging to study the structural properties of galaxies selected at a constant cumulative number density of @xmath0  mpc@xmath1  at redshifts of @xmath155 .",
    "this selection allowed us to trace the evolution of galaxies with stellar mass @xmath199  @xmath28  at @xmath105 , as they grew by a factor of @xmath9 to become @xmath21 galaxies in the local universe .",
    "this work builds on the previous analysis by @xcite , who also selected galaxies at a constant number density . here ,",
    "we employ high - resolution _ hst _ imaging and extend the analysis to @xmath2 .",
    "in contrast to mass - selected studies , our selection at a constant cumulative number density allows for a more straightforward evolutionary link between progenitors and descendants at different redshifts . at @xmath5",
    ", we employed candels wfc3 @xmath3 and @xmath4 imaging in the uds , while at @xmath7  we used wide - field acs @xmath6 imaging in cosmos to fit single - component srsic profiles at a common rest - frame wavelength .",
    "the resulting srsic indices , effective radii , and axis ratios were used to aid in our analysis . the uniform data sets and analysis methods carried out in this work serve to minimize systematics .",
    "our main conclusions are the following :    1 .",
    "the typical galaxy at the selected value of @xmath8 has grown in effective radius by a factor of @xmath192 , mostly since @xmath11 ( figure  [ fig_cumnum_structure ] ) .",
    "the evolution in the stellar mass surface density profiles of galaxies selected at @xmath8 indicates that most of the mass in the central regions was in place by @xmath11 , while almost all of the new mass growth took place in the outer parts ( figures  [ fig_cumnum_mass_profile]-[fig_cumnum_radii_fixedmass ] ) .",
    "this inside - out mass growth is responsible for the increase in size and srsic index toward low redshift .",
    "3 .   at @xmath13",
    ", we find that as the stellar mass builds up , the effective radius grows as @xmath14 , in excellent agreement with @xcite .",
    "recent simulations show that such a dependence is consistent with mergers with mass ratios of 1:5 being responsible for much of the size growth @xcite .",
    "4 .   at @xmath2 ,",
    "the rest - frame @xmath138 colors , srsic indices , and axis ratios indicate that the progenitors of present day massive galaxies were star - forming disks with @xmath200  kpc and a third of the @xmath10 stellar mass . at @xmath201 , these galaxies doubled in stellar mass and were mostly compact qgs .",

    ", we can confirm some of the general findings in the main part of the paper where the sample was much smaller due to the number density selection .",
    "figure  [ fig_uvj ] shows @xmath138 diagrams for galaxies in different redshift bins at @xmath155  above a stellar mass of @xmath202 . above this mass limit",
    ", the sample is complete for qgs and sfgs to @xmath203 @xcite , thus the highest redshift bin at @xmath77 likely exhibits some incompleteness for qgs .",
    "the subset of objects with measured structural parameters from the _ hst _ imaging is color - coded according to their srsic index .",
    "for the cosmos sample at @xmath7 , each color - color bin is color - coded according to the median srsic index for galaxies in that bin and the symbol size reflects the size of the sample within the bin ( on a logarithmic scale ) .",
    "the boundary distinguishing qgs from sfgs is shown for each redshift bin .",
    "for the redshift range studied here , figure  [ fig_uvj ] shows the buildup in the proportion of qgs , down to a fixed mass limit , with time .",
    "the figure also shows that qgs generally have higher srsic indices relative to sfgs at a given redshift .",
    "this is also the case for optically red galaxies ( e.g. , @xmath204 ) , where @xmath138-selected qgs have higher srsic indices relative to reddened sfgs .",
    "the @xmath138 selection therefore works efficiently to distinguish galaxies to @xmath2 based not only on their sfhs , but also their structural properties .",
    "this was suggested in the analysis at constant number density , but is confirmed here with a much larger sample .",
    "the fact that qgs and sfgs have different structural properties at the highest redshifts provides additional confidence in the structural parameters obtained from galfit : high and low srsic index galaxies are found where we think they should lie , in the quiescent and star - forming regions of @xmath138 color space , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig_sersic ] shows the median srsic index , @xmath65 , of qgs and sfgs at different redshifts .",
    "error bars ( @xmath205 ) were computed by bootstrapping the sample in different redshift bins .",
    "note that the random errors at @xmath141 are generally smaller than the size of the data point given the large sample size in cosmos .",
    "qgs ( red circles ) show mild evolution in their srsic index over @xmath155 , increasing slightly from @xmath206 to @xmath207 at low redshift",
    ". a fit of the form @xmath208 indicates that @xmath209 .",
    "we ignore the @xmath142 qg data point for this fit as incompleteness likely plays a role for qgs at the highest redshifts . in carrying out these fits",
    ", we also add a 10% systematic uncertainty in quadrature to the random errors to account for potential differences between the cosmos and uds samples . the median srsic index for sfgs ( blue circles ) increases from @xmath210 at @xmath89 to @xmath211 at low redshift .",
    "a fit of the form @xmath208 indicates that @xmath212 .",
    "the srsic indices of both qgs and sfgs with mass @xmath202  are therefore decreasing toward higher redshifts .",
    "a potential technical explanation for the declining srsic indices of qgs with redshift is the presence of sfgs which scatter into the qg bin .",
    "the rest - frame colors are more uncertain at higher redshifts and there are relatively more sfgs , which generally have lower srsic indices .",
    "we test this explanation by comparing the ssfrs of qgs with high srsic indices ( @xmath213 ) with those that have low srsic indices ( @xmath214 ) . using the ssfrs from the sed fit we find that for the different redshift bins above @xmath57 , the qgs with low and high srsic indices generally have median ssfrs within the uncertainties .",
    "we note that for the highest redshift bin , @xmath77 , the difference in ssfr is somewhat larger .",
    "however , incompleteness for qgs likely plays a role for this redshift bin .",
    "it is worth noting that for a similar mass limit as in this work , @xcite also find that the srsic indices of qgs decline to @xmath215 with qgs selected based on an ssfr limit and a lack of detection in mips 24  imaging . likewise for sfgs at low redshift ,",
    "the more numerous qg population could scatter into the sfg selection , leading to an elevated median srsic index for sfgs .",
    "the smaller uncertainties for the rest - frame colors make this scenario less likely .",
    "we confirm that the typical ssfrs of sfgs at @xmath7 with low and high srsic indices are the same within the uncertainties .",
    "we therefore conclude that the decline with redshift in the srsic index for qgs and sfgs with mass @xmath202  is not a consequence of galaxies of either type scattering into the other bin .",
    "again , we note that at the highest redshifts , the srsic indices obtained from galfit are generally different for qgs and sfgs , as is the case at lower redshifts where the signal - to - noise of the measurements is more robust .",
    "in addition to our simulations discussed earlier , this point affirms that our structural parameters are reasonable at high redshift .",
    "figure  [ fig_size](a ) shows the median effective radius ( @xmath66 ) of qgs and sfgs at different redshifts .",
    "qgs above @xmath202  show substantial evolution in their sizes over @xmath155 , increasing by roughly a factor of @xmath9 from @xmath216  kpc to @xmath217  kpc .",
    "a fit of the form @xmath218 indicates that @xmath219 for qgs .",
    "the qg data point at @xmath77 was again not included in the fit due to incompleteness .",
    "meanwhile , sfgs increase in size by a factor of @xmath45 over the same redshift range from @xmath220  kpc to @xmath221  kpc .",
    "we find @xmath222 for sfgs .",
    "we note that at high redshifts , the median sizes for qgs and sfgs are always larger than the measurement limits imposed by the psf of the wfc3 @xmath3 ( fwhm/2  @xmath223 ) and @xmath4 ( fwhm/2  @xmath224 ) imaging .",
    "figure  [ fig_size](b ) shows the median mass - normalized effective radius versus redshift for qgs ( red ) and sfgs ( blue ) .",
    "the effective radii were normalized to a stellar mass of @xmath225  @xmath28  assuming a size - mass relation @xmath226 , where @xmath227 for qgs and @xmath228 for sfgs @xcite .",
    "the mass - normalized radii therefore represent the size that galaxies would have if they lie on the given size - mass relation with a stellar mass of @xmath225  @xmath28 .",
    "a fit of the form @xmath229 , where @xmath230  @xmath28 , indicates that @xmath231 for qgs and @xmath232 for sfgs .    for our mass - limited sample ,",
    "the median size of qgs is generally smaller than that of sfgs at a given redshift and the sizes of both qgs and sfgs decrease toward higher redshift as also found by several other authors ( e.g. , * ? ?",

    "the dashed lines are fits of the form @xmath233 . for qgs ,",
    "a fit to the data at @xmath234 indicates @xmath235 , consistent with no change over this redshift range in the median @xmath67 .",
    "the median axis ratio for all qgs at @xmath234 is @xmath236 , which is very close to the value computed by @xcite for a similar mass limit ( after accounting for imf differences ) and redshift range .",
    "incompleteness impacts the qg data point at @xmath77 and is therefore ignored in the fit above .",
    "also shown in figure  [ fig_boa ] is the median @xmath67 value at @xmath10 from sdss determined by @xcite for galaxies with stellar mass @xmath237 .",
    "@xcite find no change in the distribution of axis ratios of qgs from @xmath10 to @xmath238 , consistent with our results at those redshifts .",
    "for a sample of 14 qgs at @xmath239 with stellar masses @xmath240  @xmath28 , @xcite computed a median axis ratio of @xmath241 .",
    "for the same redshift range and mass cut , we measure a median axis ratio of @xmath242 for 46 qgs , which is consistent with that of @xcite .",
    "they suggest that qgs may be more disk dominated at high redshift based on the proportion of qgs with low axis ratios .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the distribution of axis ratios with larger samples may lead to a more definitive answer .",
    "the median axis ratio of sfgs also does not change significantly over @xmath155 .",
    "we find @xmath243 , consistent with no evolution .",
    "the median value for the axis ratio of sfgs over @xmath155  is @xmath244 .",
    "the deviation at @xmath125 is within @xmath245 of this value .",
    "interestingly , for a population of infinitely thin disks , the median observed axis ratio would be @xmath198 , not far from the value found here .",
    "the mass selection affords a larger sample at @xmath89 than was possible with the number density selection .",
    "we find that the general trends found with the latter selection still hold with this much larger mass - limited sample .",
    "in particular , the axis ratios of sfgs , which dominate both the mass - limited sample and the number density selected sample at @xmath102 , display median axis ratios consistent with randomly oriented disks .",
    "the implemented stellar mass limit , @xmath202 , to first order limits variations in the distribution of stellar masses across different redshift bins .",
    "this works to minimize residual correlations between various parameters and stellar mass . for qgs ,",
    "the range of median stellar masses for the different redshift bins is only @xmath246  dex .",
    "for sfgs , the range in median stellar masses is somewhat higher at @xmath247  dex , with the higher redshift bins ( @xmath57 ) having more massive sfgs above the mass limit .",
    "we do not expect this difference for sfgs to have a significant impact on our conclusions .",
    "in fact , it strengthens many of our key points .",
    "for example , if higher mass sfgs have higher srsic indices , then the srsic indices for sfgs at @xmath151 should be even lower than those at low redshift after correcting to the same median mass ."
