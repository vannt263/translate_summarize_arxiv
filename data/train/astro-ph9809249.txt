    "the second byurakan survey ( herafter sbs ) was aimed to reach fainter limiting magnitudes ( markarian & stepanian 1983 , 1984a , 1984b ; markarian et al .",
    "1985 , 1986 ; stepanian et al . 1988 , 1990",
    "; stepanian 1994 ) in comparison with first byurakan survey ( markarian 1967 ) .    between 1974 and 1991 a total area of 1000 square degrees of the sky",
    "were observed down to the limiting magnitude @xmath0 .",
    "this area is confined by the strip defined by @xmath1 , @xmath2 .",
    "a selection of more than 1700 galaxies and about 1800 stellar objects with an excess ultraviolet emission is the main result of the sbs survey ( stepanian 1994 ) .",
    "infrared data for nearly 500 sbs galaxies were obtained from the ned(_nasa / ipac extragalactic database _ ) , ipss ( _ iras point source survey _ ) and ifss ( _ iras faint source survey _ ) .",
    "about 50 sbs galaxies are newly identified with iras sources .",
    "the difference of coordinates less than @xmath3 had been used for preliminary identification .",
    "the presence of optical objects had been analysed in the @xmath3 circle with the centres of iras coordinates .",
    "then the sbs galaxies as well as the other optical objects till the limit of digitized palomar sky survey which were displased inside of mentioned circle were analyzed .",
    "the difference of coordinates for above mentioned 500 sbs iras galaxies also may be used for preliminary identification .",
    "the plot of this differences is shown in fig .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "1a that nearly 80% of objects are in the box of @xmath4 .",
    "galaxies are the only nearest objects around iras sources .",
    "there are 5 objects more , where the difference of coordinates is greater than @xmath4 , but the optical sbs galaxy is the only nearest galaxy around iras source . the remainder 25 sbs galaxies require additional identification .",
    "therefore , 25 sbs galaxies with the hight probability may be identified as iras sources .",
    "so , the total amount of sbs iras galaxies contains 525 objects , that compose about 30% of all sbs galaxies , 5% of this sources are newly identified . the list of these 25 objects is presented in the table  1 .",
    "the autor thanks j. a. stepanian for a formulation of the task and repeated discussion of this paper and n. serafimovich for her help in draw up the article .",
    "this work were supported by the research grants no .",
