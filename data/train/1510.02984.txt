    "the time - dependent many - body schrdinger equation for interacting fermions governs systems from many different fields ranging from electron dynamics in molecules @xcite in quantum or theoretical chemistry , over graphene @xcite and ( fractional ) quantum hall states @xcite in condensed matter , to the physics of quantum computation @xcite , quantum simulation @xcite or quantum dots and mesoscopic structures and interactions thereof @xcite , to name but a few .",
    "a general approach to deal with the time - dependent many - body schrdinger equation for interacting fermionic particles is hence of great and general interest , especially also in view of the recent experimental demonstration of deterministic production of few - fermion systems @xcite and their detailed investigation @xcite in the context of ultracold atoms .",
    "however , the solution of schrdinger s equation for many - body systems presents a formidable , in most cases not analytically tractable problem .",
    "the exceptions to this statement include the lieb - liniger @xcite and tonks - girardeau @xcite models for one - dimensional bosonic particles and the harmonic interaction model for fermionic or bosonic particles of any dimension @xcite . to date , unfortunately , no way has been found to scrutinize these or other analytical models to obtain solutions for the time - dependent schrdinger equation for a general problem setting .",
    "numerical methods that solve the schrdinger equation are thus needed .",
    "such numerical approaches also face limitations as the hilbert space of many - body systems is growing exponentially with the particle number . among the first approaches to the time - dependent many - body problem",
    "were so - called mean - field methods which reduce the intractably large problem by transforming the time - dependent many - body schrdinger equation ( tdse ) to an effective one - body problem .",
    "this transformation can be done in different ways .",
    "one approach is to make a mean - field ansatz for the state of the system and to derive the equations of motion for it by employing a time - dependent variational principle @xcite : demanding the stationarity of the functional action with respect to small variations of the parameters of said mean - field ansatz and demanding the solution to obey constraints ( like , for instance , normalization ) , yields the equations of motion for the parameters ( the time - dependent orbital[s ] ) in the mean - field ansatz . in the case of distinguishable particles ,",
    "one obtains the time - dependent hartree - type or self - consistent field equations @xcite . for indistinguishable bosons , these equations of motion",
    "are called time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite for a single - orbital ansatz and time - dependent multi - orbital mean - field equations @xcite for a multi - orbital ansatz . for fermions",
    "they are named time - dependent hartree ( -fock ) @xcite .",
    "all these equations have in common that they prescribe the time - evolution of a single ( [ anti-]symmetrized ) product of one - particle states or , in short , of one configuration .",
    "they therefore can not describe correlations between the particles and their dynamics adequately since that necessitates multiple configurations .    in order to straightforwardly go beyond the mean - field approach one",
    "allows not only one but all possible time - dependent configurations to contribute to the ansatz .",
    "one arrives , after a similar variational derivation as for the mean - field theories , at the multiconfigurational time - dependent hartree approach ( mctdh ) @xcite for distinguishable particles , the mctdh for bosons in the case of indistinguishable bosons @xcite ( for a dedicated version for the double - well special case , see ref .",
    "@xcite and for the multi - layer mctdh for bosons generalization , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , or the mctdh for fermions ( mctdhf ) @xcite in the case of indistinguishable fermions , which is also often refered to as multiconfigurational time - dependent hartree - fock .",
    "the generalization to multiconfigurational anstze and hence improved accuracy comes at a price : the number of ( symmetrized ) basis states increases exponentially with the number of particles considered .",
    "the improvement in accuracy , however , can be crucial in order to describe the ongoing quantum dynamics , since it incorporates the evolution of correlations between the particles or degrees of freedom in the system .",
    "moreover , the anstze of mctdh , mctdh for bosons , and mctdhf form a formally complete set of the respective many - body hilbert spaces . therefore",
    ", these methods can in principle provide the _ exact _ solution of the full tdse when a convergence with respect to the number of variational parameters in the description is achieved .",

    "@xcite .",
    "herein , we report on the implementation of mctdhf that relies on the equivalence of many - body hamiltonians in fock space to a mapping @xcite that helps us to optimally scrutinize the sparsity of the hamiltonian in configuration space .",
    "we demonstrate how the algorithm converges to the exact solutions of the tdse for the case of spin - polarized fermions even for hamiltonians with time - dependent one- and two - body potentials .",
    "we show the convergence and exactness of the algorithm , we test it with the exactly solvable harmonic interaction model ( him ) and its time - dependent generalization ( tdhim ) @xcite .",
    "thereby , we demonstrate its capability to describe both ground states as well as many - body dynamics with a time - dependent hamiltonian , including time - dependent one - body potentials and interactions , accurately .",
    "we investigate charged fermions tunneling to open space from an initial parabolic confinement similar to recent experimental realizations @xcite .",
    "we thereby verify a model for the many - boson tunneling to open space @xcite to also hold in the fermionic case .",
    "we prepare a system of @xmath0 charged , spin - polarized fermions in the ground state of a parabolic trap . by subsequently transforming the potential to an open configuration with a barrier",
    ", we allow the fermions to escape to open space by tunneling .",
    "we monitor the process with the time - evolution of the momentum distributions and the one - body and two - body correlation functions .",
    "we implemented the solution of mctdhf equations of motion extending and exploiting our previous recursive implementation of the mctdh for bosons , r - mctdhb package @xcite .",
    "the resulting software is now capable of solving the time - dependent many - body schrdinger equation for general indistinguishable particles .",
    "we name the resulting software mctdh - x , since it computes the dynamics of multi - configurational wavefunctions of x = f fermions and x = b bosons .",

    "we employ dimensionless units throughout : the dimensionless hamiltonian , eq .",

    "one uses field operators to represent the problem : @xmath13 the functions @xmath14 are an orthonormal set of single - particle states or orbitals that build up a fully anti - symmetrized basis of the @xmath1-fermion hilbert space .",

    "then , we use the time - dependent variational principle @xcite to minimize the error in describing the solution of the tdse with said ansatz .",
    "the ansatz is obtained by truncating the field operator in eq .   from an infinite to a finite sum of @xmath21 operators",

    "the him and tdhim are models that are exactly solvable when a coordinate transform from cartesian to center - of - mass and relative coordinates is applied to their hamiltonians .",
    "solutions are known for any spatial dimension and for bosonic and fermionic systems @xcite .",
    "the existence of exact solutions distinguishes the him models from other example problems such as , for instance , the helium atom ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , for which approximate solutions with a very high accuracy are available  but not exact ones .",
    "since the him and tdhim hamiltonians present a correlated many - body problem in cartesian coordinates , these models are a good test for the accuracy of the mctdhf algorithm which , of course , also works in cartesian coordinates .",
    "benchmarks have been performed previously in the case of the mctdh for bosons with the him and its time - dependent generalization , the tdhim in refs .",
    "let us mention here , that the tdhim presents a much tougher problem for the algorithm than typical physical problems like the tunneling to open space discussed in sec .",
    "[ tunnel : sec ] because the tdhim hamiltonian has time - dependent both one - body and two - body terms .",

    "we asses the correctness of our implementation and the formal exactness of mctdhf with the fermionic versions of the tdhim .",

    "this is analogous to the convergence of mctdhb(@xmath21 ) for the tdhim model as shown in refs .",
    "we note here , that in the cases that the energies obtained from mctdhf(@xmath21 ) are identical to the exact one , a further increase of @xmath21 does not change the predictions of the method anymore : the wavefunction s time - evolution converges and represents a _ numerically exact _ solution to the time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "importantly , the occupations of the least occupied orbitals remain negligibly small in the case of a converged solution of the tdse with mctdhf(@xmath21 ) .",
    "this renders a practical criterion for the convergence and numerical exactness of mctdhf(@xmath21 ) for any given application .",
    "there is outstanding experimental progress in the deterministic production of few - fermion systems @xcite and detailed investigations on their properties @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is here , that these experiments with few - fermion systems consider situations where one or several of the particles are escaping from an initial confinement to open space .",
    "the theoretical work entailing the above experiments deals mostly with the issue of the decay rates with respect to the possible different decay channels for fermions with internal structure , see for instance @xcite .",
    "the correlation functions and their evolution have , however , not been systematically investigated yet .",
    "this motivates us to apply mctdhf to the problem of initially parabolically confined fermions that are allowed to tunnel through a potential barrier to open space .",
    "we stress here that our simulations below consider a system with a similar one - body potential as the few - fermion systems in the experiments of the heidelberg group @xcite , but , both , the two - body potential and the constituents of the system differ from the experimental realization : in our simulations coulomb and not contact interactions are considered and the constituents we consider are spin - polarized fermions and not fermions with an internal degree of freedom .",
    "we adopt our scheme to model the process from previous work on bosons tunneling to open space @xcite : the system is initialized in the interacting groundstate of a parabolic potential ( time @xmath104 ) .",
    "subsequently , at time @xmath105 , the potential is transformed to an open form with a barrier that allows for the system to tunnel to open space .",

    "[ fig : tunmod](a ) ) is too small for larger particle numbers to still speak of a tunneling process : for the case of @xmath116 the energy per particle is comparable to the height of the barrier . let us emphasize that we checked the results in the following for their convergence with respect to the number of orbitals @xmath21 in our computations and found that @xmath117 orbitals yield an essentially exact description .    in the following ,",

    "moreover , this strong correlation on the off - diagonal of @xmath138 can be interpreted as a feature of the process being sequential .",
    "since the overall features in the momentum distributions ( peaks corresponding to chemical potentials ) and the one - body correlation functions ( line structure in @xmath112-space ) are quite similar in the case of fermions and bosons , we conclude that ( i ) the model in fig .  [",
    "fig : tunmod ] initially put forward for bosons is indeed also predictive for the case of fermions and ( ii ) the process for fermions is likely to allow for a control by the threshold value of the potential @xmath173 in the same way as it does for bosons @xcite : by changing the threshold @xmath174 , the peaks in the momentum distribution can be shifted and are turned off when @xmath174 becomes larger than the chemical potential corresponding to the respective process .",
    "the newly discovered feature of correlated two - body tunneling as well as the found differences in the time - evolution of the one - body correlation function are motivating for a more detailed investigation of the process using the two - body correlations .",
    "these can be quantified by the two - body correlation function @xmath175 here , @xmath176 is the reduced two - body density ( cf .",
    ". in fig .",
    "[ fig : tun - g2s ] , we depict a plot of @xmath139 in momentum space ( @xmath177 ) for the case of @xmath118 .",
    "as a first observation , we find that the two - body correlation function in momentum space exhibits a structure which is complementary to the one - body correlation function @xmath138 in momentum space ( top row of fig .",
    "[ fig : tun - gs ] ) : whereever @xmath178 is comparatively large , @xmath179 is comparatively small and vice versa .",
    "moreover , we can decipher the details of the mechanism of the two - body tunneling to open space : a particle escaping with @xmath180 is bunched with the other particle not having the same momentum , i.e. , @xmath181 only for @xmath182 and @xmath53 otherwise ( see arrows at @xmath135 in fig .",
    "[ fig : tun - g2s ] ) .",
    "this means that it is likely that the second particle travels at a different velocity if the first one is found traveling at @xmath171 .",
    "moreover , a particle traveling at velocity @xmath183 is bunched with the other particle having the momentum @xmath167 , i.e. , @xmath184 only for @xmath185 and @xmath53 otherwise .",
    "this underlines the sequential nature of the process : the second particle at @xmath167 can start its escape only , once the other particle has already escaped with the momentum @xmath171 ( see arrows at @xmath136 in fig .  [ fig : tun - g2s ] ) .",
    "moreover , the two - body correlation function demonstrates clearly that the peaks in the momentum distributions at @xmath141 ( cf . top right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : tun - ks ] ) indeed correspond to a correlated two - body escape : two particles escape with similar momenta as @xmath179 exhibits strong bunching on the diagonal around @xmath186 .",
    "this bunching feature in @xmath139 on the diagonal disappears for the cases in which the peaks around @xmath141 are absent in the momentum distributions , i.e. , for @xmath119 and @xmath187 ( not shown ) .",
    "this corroborates the finding that the two - body escape we see is indeed an `` over - the - barrier '' effect and not tunneling .",
    "in the present work , we have demonstrated that the mctdhf theory and algorithm are capable of solving general time - dependent many - fermion problems to an arbitrary degree of accuracy , i.e. , we have shown the _ numerical exactness _ of mctdhf for the spin - polarized case .",
    "we found exponentially converging groundstate energy eigenvalues for the eigenstates of the harmonic interaction model . solving the time - dependent harmonic interaction model with mctdhf we demonstrated that even with erratically time - dependent one - body and two - body terms in the hamiltonian , an exact solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation can still be obtained .",
    "we further studied the tunneling to open space process of few - fermion systems composed of charged spin - polarized particles .",
    "we assess the validity of a model put forward for the process for bosons with a contact interaction potential also in the present case of fermions interacting with a regularized coulomb interaction .",
    "the prediction of the model for the escape momenta of the fermions is remarkably accurate . from a comparison of the momentum distributions and one - body correlation functions in the process with the model",
    ", we infer that the many - fermion tunneling to open space process is built up from sequentially happening single particle processes whose characteristic momenta @xmath148 emerge from the chemical potentials @xmath149 of trapped subsystems of decreasing particle number @xmath188 . for the case , where the total energy of the system is sufficiently above the barrier height of the single - particle potential",
    ", we find an additional signature in the momentum distributions , which is associated with a correlated two - body escape process .",
    "using the two - body momentum correlation function , we were able to demonstrate the sequentiality of the process and that the discussed two - body process corresponds to an `` over - the - barrier '' escape and not tunneling .",
    "as further future applications of our mctdhf implementation , we envisage for instance studies of statistical relaxation and chaos @xcite , quantum turbulence @xcite and vortices @xcite as well as hubbard hamiltonians @xcite , electronic decay processes @xcite , and high harmonic generation @xcite .",
