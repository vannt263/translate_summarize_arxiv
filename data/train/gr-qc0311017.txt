    "tightly bound binary systems consisting of a compact object of a few solar masses and a supermassive black hole of @xmath5 are very promising sources of gravitational waves for space - based detectors such as lisa  @xcite .",
    "there is now strong evidence that most galaxies harbour a @xmath5 supermassive black hole in their centre  @xcite , and that they are likely surrounded by a large population of solar - mass compact objects that reside in the galactic cusp  @xcite .",
    "the motion of objects in the galactic cusp is governed by the gravity of the supermassive black hole , but they are also constantly scattered due to the presence of multiple compact objects . for a given compact object ,",
    "this process occurs until it settles on a highly eccentric orbit that is tightly bound to the central black hole .",
    "on such an orbit , the object passes very close to the black hole at periastron and it emits a significant amount of gravitational waves .",
    "capture occurs for those orbits that are sufficiently eccentric and have a sufficiently small periastron ( on the order of @xmath1 )  @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "orbital evolution is driven by emission of gravitational waves , and the binary strongly radiates gravitational radiation , until the final plunge of the compact object into the central black hole .",
    "the question is then to determine the rate at which solar - mass compact objects are captured by the central black hole and how quickly the orbits decay by emission of gravitational waves . because capture occurs when the time to evolve due to emission of gravitational waves is much smaller than the time to evolve due to diffusion and scattering , determination of the type of orbits for which capture occurs and estimate of capture rates are sensitive to the strength of gravitational wave emission .",
    "current estimates of orbital parameters for which capture occurs and associated capture rates are based on the quadrupole approximation for the emission of gravitational waves  @xcite .",
    "although this is well justified for large periastron , it is not a good approximation for highly eccentric orbits with small periastron , those of interest for gravitational - wave astronomy .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a situation in which the compact object has already been captured by a spherically symmetric central black hole , and calculate the correct , general relativistic , rates at which the system loses energy and angular momentum to gravitational waves .",
    "we consider three types of orbits : circular , eccentric and parabolic orbits .",
    "these calculations will then be used to refine capture rates estimate , but this will be left for future work .    at this level of approximation ,",
    "the internal dynamics of the small compact object are irrelevant .",
    "we treat it as a point - particle and base our calculations on first - order perturbations of a schwarzschild black hole ; this is appropriate in view of the small mass ratio involved .",
    "the gravitational waveforms produced by the orbital motion are obtained by solving the even parity zerilli - moncrief  @xcite ( zm ) and the odd parity regge - wheeler  @xcite ( rw ) equations .",
    "we work with schwarzschild coordinates , for which both wave equations take the form @xmath6\\psi_{lm}(r , t)=s_{lm}(r , t),\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the usual tortoise coordinate , and @xmath8 is a potential defined in eq .",

    "lousto and r.h .",
    "price  @xcite , and later corrected by k.  martel and e.  poisson to yield second - order convergence  @xcite ; it is a finite - difference scheme , based on the null - cones of the schwarzschild spacetime , which incorporates the source term without approximating @xmath16 $ ] and @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "this method is advantageous compared to fourier decomposition because of the need , in the case of highly eccentric orbits , to sum over a very large number of frequencies in order to obtain accurate results  @xcite . as an added bonus ,",
    "the time - domain method provides the zerilli - moncrief and regge - wheeler functions everywhere in the spacetime . for each multipole moment ,",
    "information about the fluxes of energy and angular momentum at infinity and through the event horizon is obtained by a single numerical integration .",
    "astrophysical black holes are very likely to be rapidly rotating and the assumption of spherical symmetry for the central black hole is unrealistic . however , removing this assumption would require a substantial revision of our numerical method .",
    "the source term for the schwarzschild perturbation equations can be treated exactly because , by removing the angular dependence , the problem is reduced to integrating a one - dimensional partial differential equation . a divergent source term of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : src ] ) then leads to a simple jump in the field at the particle s position , and this can easily be handled by finite - difference methods . for a rotating black hole ,",
    "one is faced with the task of solving the inhomogeneous teukolsky equation  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that this equation is not separable in the time domain , because the eigenvalues of the angular functions are frequency dependent .",
    "insisting on working in the time domain leaves a two - dimensional partial differential equation to integrate .",
    "unfortunately , a @xmath18-function source no longer leads to a simple jump at the position of the particle : the field is now ( logarithmically ) divergent at this location .",
    "standard finite - difference methods are inadequate to deal with this type of behaviour and can not be used .",
    "the problem can be circumvented by smearing the particle around its position ( for example by using narrow gaussian functions instead of @xmath18-functions ) .",
    "this eliminates the divergence in the source term and , consequently , in the field ; standard finite - difference methods can then be applied .",
    "such an approach has been used to obtain gravitational waveforms produced by a particle on an equatorial circular orbit of the kerr black hole  @xcite , but the error introduced by smearing the particle is difficult to ascertain . by specializing to schwarzschild , comparison with the present work",

    "the velocity of the particle is small and it takes much longer for the particle to reach periastron than for the initial gravitational - wave content to escape from the system . at the point where the emission of radiation is strongest , there is no trace left of the initial configuration of the gravitational perturbations .",
