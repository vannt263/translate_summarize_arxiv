    "as the first generation of gravitational wave interferometers perform observations at or near their design sensitivities , new methods are being developed to detect and characterize gravitational wave burst signals .",
    "accurate determination of the source direction is fundamental for all analyses of a candidate signal .",
    "there are two approaches to localizing a source on the celestial sphere : coincident and coherent .",
    "coincident methods@xcite analyze the data from each detector separately and then identify events that occur simultaneously in multiple interferometers .",
    "the arrival times and amplitudes in each detector can then be used to determine the source direction if the signal is linearly polarized or has polarization peaks separated by less than the timing uncertainty .",
    "coherent methods @xcite combine the data streams from multiple detectors into a single statistic before reconstructing gravitational wave candidates .",
    "one previous coincident study on source location estimation was completed by cavalier et al@xcite . in that work ,",
    "arrival times ( assumed known ) and their uncertainties ( assumed gaussian ) were input to a @xmath1 minimimization routine to determine the source location .",
    "the approach is applicable to an arbitrary number of interferometers and shows excellent resolution in monte carlo simulations with arrival time uncertainties on the order of 0.1 ms . in this paper",
    "we implement an equivalent least squares approach in the two and three interferometer cases , but also consider arrival time uncertainites up to 3 ms .",
    "these larger uncertainties have been observed in studies with real noise@xcite and reveal a systematic bias in the source directions obtained from timing reconstruction methods for moderate to low signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) .",
    "we define the snr @xmath2 as    @xmath3    where    @xmath4    is the fourier transform of the gravitational wave signal and    @xmath5    is the one - sided power spectrum of the detector noise .",
    "we will show that the bias is most significant near the plane of interferometers in the three detector case , agreeing with the observation of reduced resolution in this region by @xcite .",
    "we compute a numerical table of corrections for the three - interferometer bias and note that a similar procedure may be followed for an arbitrary network of detectors . we also find that the bias may be corrected through the application of a more detailed parameter estimation @xcite , which has the effect of reducing arrival time errors .",
    "our application of the least squares estimator with bias correction to simulated data is the first test of coincident source localization with simulated detector noise .",
    "coherent methods also offer promise for source direction estimation .",
    "the first coherent analysis was described by grsel and tinto@xcite .",
    "their approach combines the data from a three interferometer network to form a `` null stream '' where the gravitational wave signal should be cancelled completely if the assumed source direction is correct .",
    "the true source direction is estimated by looping over a grid of angular locations and minimizing the result . other grid - based approaches to source localization include the maximum likelihood approach of flanagan and hughes@xcite and the constraint likelihood method of klimenko et al@xcite .",
    "the required resolution of the grids used in these analyses increases with the maximum frequency of the search ; for ligo burst searches that extend past @xmath6 hz@xcite approximately @xmath7 grid points are necessary . in practice much coarser grids must be used due to computational limitations , potentially leading to missed minima and incorrect directional estimates .",
    "it should also be noted that coherent methods implemented with constraints are insensitive to some signal morphologies and ( small ) sky regions .",
    "the amplitude test described here is similar to the null stream approach , but does not require minimization over a grid because it works in terms of the root - sum - squared strain amplitude    @xmath8    throughout this paper @xmath0 will refer to the `` intrinsic '' gravitational wave signal at the earth , i.e. prior to reduction by the detector antenna pattern .",
    "the test uses the @xmath0 values from three non co - located interferometers to choose between the two possible source directions given by timing considerations and is effective for moderate to high snr .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "section ii describes the angular bias in the least squares approach to source localization using arrival times from either two or three interferometers . in each case , a monte carlo simulation is pursued and used to characterize and numerically correct the observed bias .",
    "section iii introduces the aforementioned amplitude check that can be used to differentiate between the two possible source locations given by arrival time considerations in the three interferometer geometry .",
    "both the time - based source direction estimator in ( ii ) and the amplitude check in ( iii ) were tested on ligo - virgo simulated data and the results are described in section iv .",
    "in the following we examine the standard least squares approach to source localization for both the two and three interferometer geometries . we restrict ourselves to studying short duration ( @xmath9 1 s ) `` burst '' signals so that the motion of the earth may be neglected .",
    "we also assume that the difference in travel time between sites is due only to the direction of the source , as explained in the introduction .",
    "is constrained in the two interferometer ( ifo ) case , while both angles @xmath10 and @xmath11 are constrained in the three ifo case.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]      when the network consists of two detectors at different locations , the angle @xmath10 between the source unit vector and the vector connecting the sites ( baseline ) is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the time delay , @xmath14 is the distance between detectors , and @xmath15 is the speed of light .",
    "this relationship is only exact in the absence of noise and constrains the source direction to a ring on the sky .",
    "when the arrival time estimates are affected by noise , the following least squares estimator can be used :    @xmath16    this is the maximum likelihood estimator and is the optimal choice for small arrival time errors . note that the addition of noise introduces timing errors that may lead to estimated time delays greater than the light travel time between detectors .",
    "these unphysical delays are mapped to the polar angle that produces the time delay closest to what is observed .",

    "this second scenario is often the case for signals with multiple peaks . in both cases we chose",
    "coordinates as indicated in figure 1 and used the time delay provided by the ligo livingston ( l1 ) - ligo hanford ( h1 ) baseline .",
    "twenty thousand sets of arrival times ( with simulated error ) from 1800 different sky positions were produced via a gaussian random number generator .",
    "the sky points were spaced by @xmath18 on the @xmath11 = @xmath19 meridian of our symmetric coordinate system . for each sky location ,",
    "the estimator expectation value @xmath20 and its variance @xmath21 were computed .",
    "a nonzero systematic bias @xmath22 was observed and is plotted against true polar angle @xmath10 in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "the bias in each trial is similar and in each case increases with the variance of the arrival time distribution .",
    "we observed the bias to grow with the arrival time uncertainty , and expect it to maintain a similar shape for symmetric distributions .",
    "the bias is a result of two features of the estimator :    1 . )",
    "mapping of unphysical time delays ( @xmath23 ) to the two interferometer baseline has the effect of pushing the expectation value of the estimated angle towards the equator .    2 . )",
    "the nonlinear mapping between the time delay @xmath13 and the angle @xmath10 contributes to the bias through the following relation :    @xmath24    this implies that the distribution @xmath25 will reflect the distribution of time delays @xmath26 modulated by a sinusoidal jacobian . assuming a normal distribution for @xmath26 results in the bias shape seen in figure 2 , while the multimodal distribution discussed above yields the shape seen in figure 3 .",
    "note that the bias is a result of the network geometry and is therefore independent of coordinate choice .",
    "we verified this statement numerically by observing the same bias for every sky position when @xmath10 was chosen along an axis different from the interferometer baseline .",
    "we also verified this property in the three interferometer case , as discussed below .      in the three interferometer case",
    "there are two independent baselines , so a least squares estimator will constrain the source direction to two patches on the sky .",
    "these patches will be mirror images around the plane formed by the three detectors and are indistinguishable because they yield identical time delays .",
    "the plane of interferometers is the y - z plane in our chosen coordinate system as shown in figure 1 .",
    "with these coordinates , we can easily determine the output of a least squares estimator given three arrival times .",
    "the delay times @xmath27 , @xmath28 and their uncertainties are defined in terms of the three arrival times @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 :    @xmath32    @xmath33    @xmath34    @xmath35    the uncertainties were defined assuming a gaussian spread around each true arrival time .",
    "using these definitions the least squares location estimator ( also the maximum likelihood estimator if the arrival times follow a gaussian distribution ) is equivalent to the following :    1 . ) if @xmath36 & @xmath37 :    @xmath38    2 . )",

    "the cases ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) occur when one time delay is unphysical and places the source location along the appropriate baseline .",
    "the cases ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) are a result of analyzing one angle first , and place the source at the correct azimuthal angle if the second time delay is unphysical given the first .",

    "the simulation consisted of 8281 grid points spread isotropically across one hemisphere .",
    "the hemisphere was chosen to be @xmath53 in our symmetric coordinates ( figure 1 ) ; the results for the other hemisphere would be a mirror image of these . for 3000 iterations at each grid point , the true arrival time in each detector was added to normally distributed random noise .",
    "this gaussian noise was taken to have zero mean and variance equal to that of the arrival time .",
    "the average angular error in the location reconstruction of this simulation is shown in figure 4 .",
    "this error was calculated by first computing the angle between the true source position ( grid point ) and estimated location in each trial .",
    "these angular errors were then averaged for each true position ( grid point ) and turned into the map shown in figure 4 . as in the two interferometer case ,",
    "a systematic bias made a significant contribution to the overall error .",
    "we define the bias in the polar and azimuthal angles as @xmath22 and @xmath54 respectively .",
    "note that trials where the source was placed on a pole were only counted toward the expectation value @xmath20 , as @xmath10 is well - defined at these points but @xmath11 is not .",

    "note that the location estimation performed by this algorithm and the bias correction are independent of coordinate choice .",
    "this is because the estimator places the source in the bin that yields time delays closest to what is observed regardless of whether the input time delays are physical .",
    "we verified this property by recomputing the bias in an arbitrary coordinate system and observing the same results upon rotation back to our original coordinates .",
    "the bias observed in the three interferometer geometry can be easily corrected numerically . for a given network configuration and set of arrival time uncertainties",
    ", one can construct a sky map of the effect of the bias .",

    "this error is defined as    .fraction of events with sufficient energy for parameter estimation to estimate parameters .",
    "note that this fraction is larger than what would be detected by a search algorithm tuned to the same frequency range @xcite due to inclusion of low energy events that would fall below standard detection thresholds .",

    "the average was taken over all sky locations and polarization angles where a signal was visible to the parameter estimation in all three detectors , and was found to be virtually identical with and without the bias correction . as can be seen from figure 11 , a few outlying samples caused the average error in each case to be significantly higher than most individual errors .",
    "these outliers were due to incorrect peak time estimates from the parameter estimation .",
    "in most cases the algorithm picked a secondary peak of the signal ( see figure 12 ) , causing the arrival time estimate to be off by a few milliseconds and resulting in a large error in the directional estimate .",
    "the sg820 and dfm a1b2g1 waveforms were particularly susceptible to this , as shot noise becomes firmly established at the higher frequencies where these signals are concentrated",
    ". the lack of impact of the bias correction can be attributed to the relatively small timing uncertainties ( approximately 0.1 ms ) given by the parameter estimation .",
    "the bias is negligible for such small timing errors , so the correction did not lead to substantial improvement in the trials undertaken . even with weaker input signals , the bias correction was seen to be inconsequential as the arrival time uncertainties remained low .",
    "it should also be noted that the errors in the arrival time estimates were observed to follow multi - modal distributions in waveforms with multiple peaks , as the most significant errors were a result of the parameter estimation choosing the wrong peak .    .",

    "this differs by less than an order of magnitude from the observed average angular error for all waveforms at an intrinsic inband @xmath0 of @xmath118 , which corresponds to a loud astrophysical source ( snr @xmath119 20 ) .     for each of the sample waveforms .",

    "the simulations were again generated in terms of intrinsic inband @xmath0 and scaled down by their antenna factors before being added to the data .",
    "note that the reported efficiencies are an average over all directions and polarization angles where the signal was detected in all three interferometers .",
    "two sets of trials were conducted : one where the exact arrival times were assumed to be known for forming the last ( coherent ) term in ( 40 ) and one where the parameter estimation peak times were used for its determination .",
    "the efficiencies were only slightly better with the former `` aligned '' approach , showing that the peak times from the parameter estimation are sufficient to accurately calculate the coherent term .",
    "the efficiencies for the sg820 and dfm a1b2g1 waveforms were slighly below those of the other waveforms due to their power being concentrated at higher frequencies where the interferometer noise is worse .",
    "this work focused on two aspects of coincident source localization .",
    "the first was a least squares analysis that used signal arrival times and their uncertainties to estimate the direction of the source .",
    "this estimator was studied and found to be biased in both the two and three interferometer cases , with the effect increasing with arrival time uncertainty .",
    "the cause of the bias was seen to be twofold as both the allocation of unphysical time delays to their most likely direction and the nonlinear mapping between the time delays and source coordinates contributed to the effect .",
    "the bias will exist for networks with an arbitrary number of detectors , and can be determined numerically through monte carlo simulations with a @xmath1 minimization routine such as that described in @xcite . in each case the bias can be corrected numerically with the correction being relevant for arrival time uncertainties greater than about 1 ms .",
    "studies on real data @xcite indicate that such uncertainties are probable using conventional detection algorithms .",
    "our analysis indicates that the bias may also be corrected through the reduction of arrival time errors provided by a thorough parameter estimation such as the one used here@xcite .",
    "the second piece of coincident analysis described here was an amplitude check , applicable to both linear and multiply polarized signals , that can be used to resolve the source location degeneracy inherent in the three interferometer geometry .",
    "while this analysis is not coincident in a strict sense ( one term requires combined data streams ) , it is extremely simple and so provides a lightweight alternative to more sophisticated methods .",
    "as shown in section iv , the check is effective for realistic to loud sources , particularly those where the peak time may be recovered accurately .    one potential application for these source localization techniques would be the generation of skymaps of background and foreground triggers . in this case the amplitude check would improve the efficiency of a distributional test based on sky locations even for cases where its efficiency is only slightly better than 50% .",
    "we would expect such maps to be isotropic based on current detector sensitivity ( i.e. non - gravitational wave triggers dominate ) but in the the future such plots may give us a picture of the gravitational wave sky .",
    "methods such as those described above are useful in that they are inexpensive computationally and quite accurate in most cases . however they may struggle if a source has similar amplitudes in both the + and @xmath120 polarizations as well as a delay between the peaks of the waveforms . due to the differing antenna responses of the members of an interferometer network ,",
    "peaks corresponding to the different polarizations may be recorded in different detectors , leading to an inconsistency in arrival time estimates that can not be accounted for with coincident methods .",
    "the likelihood of this situation is currently under investigation , as is the performance of the algorithms presented here on real data with randomly polarized signals .",

    "<S> we also introduce a stand alone parameter estimation algorithm that can improve the arrival time estimation and provide root - sum - squared strain amplitude ( @xmath0 ) values for each site . in the second part of the paper </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how to resolve the directional ambiguity that arises from observations in three non co - located interferometers between the true source location and its mirror image across the plane containing the detectors . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a new , exact relationship among the @xmath0 values at the three sites that , for sufficiently large signal amplitudes , determines the true source direction regardless of whether or not the signal is linearly polarized . </S>",
    "<S> both the algorithm estimating arrival times , arrival time uncertainties , and @xmath0 values and the directional follow - up can be applied to any set of gravitational wave candidates observed in a network of three non co - located interferometers . as a case study </S>",
    "<S> we test the methods on simulated waveforms embedded in simulations of the noise of the ligo and virgo detectors at design sensitivity . </S>"
