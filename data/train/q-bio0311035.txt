    "the general framework we employ is the cellular automata ( ca ) method .",
    "ca are discrete dynamical systems whose behavior is completely specified in terms of a local relation ( rules ) .",
    "ca can be thought of as a stylized universe .",
    "space is represented by a uniform grid , with each site or  cell \" containing a few bits of data .",
    "time advances in discrete steps , and the laws of the universe are expressed by a simple recipe - say , a small look - up table - through which at each step each cell computes its new state from that of its close neighbors . the system s laws are local and uniform .    for our purpose",
    "the environment is a three - dimensional simple cubic lattice of size ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "each lattice site is in one of a finite number of distinct states .",
    "usually the number of states is small but , in principle , any finite ca model over a finite alphabet can be defined .",
    "the state of a cell ( site ) changes according to some rules .",
    "there are two distinct classes of automata : synchronous , which allows for simultaneous update of all cells states , and asynchronous",
    ". the updating order can be deterministic or random in the asynchronous class .",
    "the local rules of a certain ca are essentially determined by the considered neighborhood , consisting of the 6 nearest neighbors , 12 next - nearest and 8 next - next - nearest neighbors of a given site in the cubic lattice , 26 in total .",
    "we have used asynchronous updating .",
    "we start with a homogeneous substrate layer of bacteria of size @xmath1 submerged in water .",
    "the water initially occupies a @xmath2 volume .",
    "we deposit at random large nutrient chunks on the substrate , conveniently approximated in shape by compact rectangular pillars of cells , of size @xmath3 .",
    "the pillars are deposited with probability @xmath4 over a grid of 9 macroscopic square substrate plaquettes of area @xmath5 , each containing many substrate cells .",
    "this process creates a strongly non - uniform nutrient supply partly covering the substrate .",
    "bacterial cells may multiply _ provided _ they eat neighboring nutrient cells ( nutrient is then replaced with bacteria ) .",
    "this process is characterized by a growth probability @xmath6 and represents binary division coupled to elementary chemotaxis , as the bacteria grow and spread preferentially in the direction of highest nutrient concentration .",
    "clearly , the greater the number of neighboring cells occupied by nutrient , the greater is the probability that a bacterial cell will divide . for the time being , we disallow diffusion , and leave an examination of nutrient diffusion effects to a later section .    technically , we choose at random a pair of neighboring cells and if the pair consists of nutrient and bacteria we replace the nutrient by bacteria with probability @xmath6 and then pass on to another randomly chosen pair .",
    "we take measurements at time steps of ( @xmath7 ) updates , so that each cell has on average been visited once in every time step , and record bacterial population and nutrient configuration .",
    "we assume a probability @xmath4 for putting at random nutrient pillars over the coarse - grained substrate grid and a probability @xmath6 for bacterial cells to consume adjacent nutrient cells and subsequently divide , thereby occupying also the nutrient cell .",
    "as can be seen in the vertical section shown in figure 1 , the bacteria develop towers in the places where the nutrient was deposited at random .",
    "note the developing roughness of the originally flat bacteria / nutrient interface .",
    "_ within a tower _",
    "the growth process is eden - like ( in three dimensions ) , since all perimeter cells carry nutrient . eventually , however , the bacteria fill up the towers and perfectly flat walls and rooftops result .",
    "let us denote by @xmath8 the bacterial population , in units of cells , _ in excess _ of the initially present substrate population , so that @xmath9 .",
    "plots of @xmath8 , measured every time step , reveal a characteristic _ sigmoid _ shape , common for various biological growth processes approaching a finite carrying capacity @xcite .",
    "since the deposition of nutrient is stochastic , the carrying capacity @xmath10 depends on the sample , and consequently a @xmath10-distribution arises , each @xmath10 being simply equivalent to the total mass of deposited nutrient pillars .",
    "the speed of saturation of the population towards @xmath10 is , of course , faster when @xmath6 is bigger and for each population curve we can discern three distinct regimes as illustrated in figure 2 , for which we took @xmath11 .",
    "\\i ) the initial growth is not exponential - it would be exponential in free binary division - but is limited by the amount of nutrient in the first horizontal layer adjacent to and in contact with the bacterial substrate .",
    "the population increase is just proportional to the _ contact area _",
    "@xmath12 and to @xmath6 , leading to a _ linear _ initial growth .",
    "this stage can be characterized by a _",
    "linear saturation time _",
    "@xmath13 , proportional to @xmath14 .",
    "this is the average time needed to build a bacterial tower in the absence of interface fluctuations ( cf .",
    " mean - field \" approximation ) , and is found by simple linear extrapolation of the initial growth .",
    "ii ) the growth soon accelerates as the area of the bacteria / nutrient contact boundary increases by _ interface roughening _ and the appearance of nutrient  holes \" ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the roughness , caused by height fluctuations , is limited by the finite horizontal width of the nutrient pillar(s ) , resulting in a saturating contact area , again implying a linear growth regime .",
    "iii ) this regime in turn crosses over to an exponentially fast convergence of the growth towards @xmath10 , which is the asymptotic behaviour for long times .",
    "indeed , the bacteria reaching the ceiling of the nutrient pillar fall short of nutrient and eventually all nutrient cells are consumed .",
    "the sigmoid shape arises from the succession of these three regimes i)-iii ) .",
    "the dependence of the bacterial population on time can be understood most clearly from the time evolution of the area @xmath15 of the bacteria / nutrient contact interface , shown in figure 3 .    actually , we have @xmath16    asymptotically for long times , the decrease of the nutrient mass , @xmath17 , which equals the increase of the bacterial population @xmath8 , is simply proportional to the number of nutrient cells , since these become isolated , whence independent , and surrounded by neighboring bacterial cells .",
    "thus we have",
    "@xmath18 it follows that the asymptotic behavior of @xmath19 for long times can be written as @xmath20 where the saturation time @xmath21 is proportional to @xmath14 and depends only weakly on the probability @xmath4 of depositing nutrient pillars , because these can to a first approximation ( especially for small @xmath4 ) be considered as  non - interacting \" .",
    "numerically , @xmath22 for @xmath23 , implying a very short time scale for the actual exponential saturation in fig.2 ( right ) compared to the linear saturation time .",
    "the time @xmath24 denotes the moment for which a zero excess population , @xmath25 , would result by extrapolating backwards the asymptotic behavior .",
    "this time equals about @xmath26 for all curves with @xmath27 and about @xmath28 for all curves with @xmath29 ( fig.2 ) .",
    "it is remarkable that the three characteristic times @xmath13 , @xmath21 and @xmath24 are , within the accuracy of our computations , independent of the carrying capacity @xmath10 .",
    "we have performed simulations similar to the ones described above , but in which we have included stochastic nutrient diffusion .",
    "a probability @xmath30 is introduced for the _ interchange _ of adjacent cells , one occupied with nutrient and the other with water .",
    "this model is closer to physical , or biological , reality since the nutrient in general is soluble in water . in our simulations diffusion",
    "turns out to be necessary for generating the observed porous morphologies with fractal - like surface roughness and possible overhangs leading to mushroom - shaped towers , also seen experimentally @xcite .",
    "figures 4 and 5 show relevant vertical and horizontal sections through the developing biofilm structure .    in the presence of nutrient diffusion ,",
    "bacterial reproduction generates a two - step biofilm growth .",
    "firstly , eden - like growth driven by chemotaxis takes place in the nutrient pillars ( as for zero diffusion ) . secondly , dla - type of growth roughens and ramifies the bacterial towers as the wandering nutrient recombines by aggregation .",
    "clearly , the long time dla process determines the biofilm morphotype .",
    "a remarkable property of the fractal character of the emerging structure becomes detectable in fig.5 ( horizontal slices through the biofilm ) .",
    "sections through the top layers reveal a cascade or hierarchy of length scales . water",
    " lakes \" in bacterial ",
    "land \" develop into bacterial  islands \" surrounded by water , over a height difference of just a few layers .",
    "this is strikingly similar to the structure that is inherent in the hierarchical population model , where it is imposed _",
    "ad hoc_. in contrast , here in the simulations it occurs spontaneously .    in figure 6",
    "we observe once more the basic sigmoid shape of the @xmath8-curves describing the time evolution of the bacterial population , for 10 samples .",
    "thus the shape of the population curves is robust with respect to the new perturbation ; it is not much influenced by diffusion , at least not for short and medium times .",
    "the new feature brought about by diffusion is the existence of a _ long tail _ in @xmath8 , beginning after the formation of bacterial towers and ending when all detached nutrient has diffused  back \" towards , and is eaten by , the bacterial colonies .",
    "this tail is still exponential , but with a decay time roughly 100 times longer than in the absence of diffusion .",
    "for example , for @xmath11 and @xmath23 , we find @xmath31 .",
    "interestingly , this saturation rate turns out to be independent of @xmath30 provided @xmath32 , at least to the accuracy of our computations so far ( averaging over samples , and for @xmath33 and 1 ) .",
    "one may speculate that this could have been anticipated qualitatively , since weak diffusion leads to minor detachment of nutrient and swift recombination . on the other hand ,",
    "strong diffusion entails more detachment but also greater mobility , whence also swift aggregation .",
    "the dla process efficiency seems largely independent of the diffusion probability .",
    "the exponential character of the saturation can be understood as follows . for long times ,",
    "long after the bacterial towers are formed , the remaining water - dispersed nutrient particles can be considered as independent walkers - an assumption verified by keeping track of the asymptotic _ monomer _ character of nutrient matter in the simulations - and thus the asymptotics is again governed by @xmath34 , implying exponential decay .",
    "just like in the previous simulations without diffusion , a carrying capacity distribution is found , which is controlled by the initial stochastic deposition of nutrient pillars . for a given number of nutrient pillars ,",
    "the carrying capacity @xmath10 is fixed . to illustrate how this @xmath10-distribution emerges we present a histogram ( fig.7 ) giving the frequency of occurrence of @xmath35 , the population after ten time steps , for 1000 samples with @xmath11 , @xmath23 and @xmath36 .",
    "note the fine structure of the main peaks . to optimize the resolution we have excluded from the viewing window the trivial peak at @xmath37 ( no nutrient was put ) and a small but not negligible eighth peak ( outside of view , to the right ) .",
    "note that , as time progresses , these peaks sharpen and converge to a simple set of ten @xmath10-values corresponding to a population filling all nutrient cells originally contained in the pillars .",
    "this sharpening is particular to our simple model , and will no longer occur when additional realistic ingredients such as antibiotics , detachment of bacteria and rinsing water flow is allowed , causing fluctuations of @xmath38 .",
    "the random hierarchical population model @xcite generates bacterial towers through a more macroscopic construction algorithm .",
    "a typical _ local _ population @xmath39 grown over a substrate in the @xmath40-plane , for @xmath41 ( after four generations ) and for @xmath11 is shown in fig.8 .",
    "a vertical ( left ) and a horizontal ( right ) section through the density @xmath42 of fig.8 are shown in fig.9 .",
    "obviously , bacterial colonies of the type depicted in fig.4 ( right ) and in fig.5 are fairly well represented by figs.8 - 9 .",
    "the differences reside in the details of the self - similar properties intrinsic to the asymptotic long - time behavior of the hierarchical model and not to that of the simulations .",
    "typical population curves @xmath8 produced in the hierarchical model are displayed in fig.10 , for @xmath11 and length rescaling parameter @xmath43 .",
    "after a short transient , the populations saturate exponentially rapidly to their carrying capacity . for long times , self - similar carrying capacity distributions",
    "result @xcite , which bear a resemblance to that of fig.7 , except in the details of the fractal geometry .",
    "we now turn to the important question of whether we can provide a microscopic basis for the rescaling factor @xmath44 .    in the exactly soluble random hierarchical population model the average excess population of bacteria",
    "@xmath45 obeys the simple time evolution in discrete time @xmath46 @xcite , @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the quenched average carrying capacity .",
    "this quantity is proportional to the birth probability @xmath49 ( in the present context the probability of death , @xmath50 , equals zero , because no antibiotic or other bactericidal agent is considered)@xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath51 .",
    "the exponential saturation is characterized by a rescaling factor @xmath44 , which is introduced _",
    "ad hoc _ in that model to incorporate various possible conditions leading to a convergent population ( limited nutrient , temperature boost or quench , diffusion without convection , bacterial motility , etc . ) .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of @xmath52 is conspicuous by rewriting ( 4 ) in the form @xmath53    in our ca simulations without diffusion , the towers fill up completely and compactly with bacteria ( eventually without surface roughening ) , and the average carrying capacity is proportional to @xmath4 , the nutrient pillar deposition probability . precisely the same asymptotic result can be achieved in the hierarchical population model , provided we set @xmath54 in the first generation , and @xmath55 in all subsequent generations , while restricting the growth to the plaquettes where towers were grown in generation 1 ( i.e. , setting @xmath56 for substrate areas where no nutrient was put ) .",
    "clearly , the correspondence between @xmath44 in that model and the variables of our present simulation is @xmath57 this convergence rate applies not only to the average but also to each curve of fig.10 individually , since the process is self - averaging for long times [ 6 ] .",
    "from ( 6 ) we learn that a constant microscopic (  cellular \" ) growth probability @xmath6 combined with a finite nutrient supply , fixing @xmath10 , leads to an exponential saturation , justifying the use of and providing a microscopic interpretation for the constant rescaling factor @xmath44 in the hierarchical population model .",
    "including nutrient diffusion in the simulations affects the asymptotic long - time behavior in that a non - zero nutrient / water interchange probability @xmath30 strongly increases the saturation time .",
    "further , rough biofilm surfaces result .",
    "the hierarchical model is ideally suited to generate similar roughness , with marginal fractal geometry , in the spatial distribution of the population density @xmath58 ( fig.8 ) .",
    "note that this density does not provide full information about the three - dimensional biofilm structure - in contrast with the simulations which give the full 3d bacterial ",
    "cell \" population @xmath59 and nutrient  cell \" mass @xmath60 .",
    "the hierarchical - model population density yields a compactification in the form of a single - valued density or height profile defined over a 2d support , the substrate .",
    "thus , fig.8 shows a relevant population landscape from the hierarchical model , conform with the present 3d simulations including diffusion .",
    "once again , the length rescaling factor @xmath44 can be interpreted using the more microscopic parameters @xmath6 and @xmath30 of the ca simulations .",
    "our simulations so far suggest that ( 6 ) remains valid for @xmath61 .",
    "we have proposed a microscopic cellular automaton describing bacterial tower development on a planar substrate in a strongly non - uniform nutrient environment . the  cells \" contain bacteria , nutrient or water .",
    "a growth probability @xmath6 governs the stochastic chemotactic consumption of nutrient cells by adjacent bacterial cells , causing the former to be replaced by bacteria .",
    "a probability @xmath30 controls the interchange of neighboring nutrient and water cells , provoking nutrient diffusion .",
    "nutrient is deposited only once , at the beginning , in the form of drops or pillars , with probability @xmath4 .",
    "the strongly non - uniform nutrient supply causes bacterial colonies to grow into towers , and the absence of nutrient refuelling induces exponential saturation of the bacterial population towards a carrying capacity @xmath10 which depends on @xmath4 . in view of the quenched random deposition a @xmath10-distribution is found , rather than a single final population .",
    "typical sigmoid curves are obtained for the time - dependence of the bacterial population .",
    "the asymptotic behavior for long times can be mapped onto similar saturation behavior displayed in the hierarchical population model .",
    "the phenomenological length rescaling factor in that model , necessary to render a convergent population , can be justified at a more microscopic level through its correspondence to @xmath6 ( and @xmath30 ) found in the present work .",
    "this finding lends support to the applicability of that model as a phenomenological tool for generating fractal towering - pillar biofilm structure .",
    "the simulations can be improved easily by adding new features while keeping maximal simplicity .",
    "we consider especially the possibility to add some antibiotic , deposited with probability @xmath62 , which is capable of killing bacterial cells ( with extinction probability @xmath63 ) , and to look for its bactericidal efficiency . in this process",
    "an adjacent antibiotic / bacteria pair of cells gets replaced by a pair water / dead - cell .",
    "further , bacterial motility can be included through an additional water / bacteria cell interchange probability , allowing bacterial cells to _",
    "detach_. we have implemented these ideas in a simulation in which on each plaquette nutrient is deposited with @xmath64 , antibiotics is deposited with @xmath65 and nothing is put with probability @xmath66 . in a first approximation only _ dead cells _ are allowed to detach .",
    "all diffusive interchange probabilities ( water / nutrient , water / dead - cell , and water / antibiotic ) are set to @xmath67 .",
    "further , @xmath23 and @xmath68 .",
    "fig.11 shows a horizontal section through the resulting biofilm structure after about 20 time steps .",
    "interestingly , a bacterial tower has arisen in a nutrient - rich region ( right ) , but only a relatively small hole resulted in the neighbouring antibiotic - rich area ( middle ) . the mechanism which prevents massive extinction is the formation of a layer of dead cells mixed with water , separating the lower - lying bacteria from the bactericidal agent .",
    "this feature has no counterpart in the hierarchical population model , which is symmetric with respect to interchange of  birth \" and  death \" , but may be instrumental in biofilm resistance to antibiotics .    in a next step ,  rinsing \" can be added , entailing removal of detached bacteria , antibiotics and/or nutrient by water flow . bacterial division in low - nutrient surroundings can also be allowed for , decoupling reproduction from chemotaxis , etc .",
    "we stress that the avenues explored here , as well as in the hierarchical model , provide a non - uniform ( random ) environment for the growth of towering pillar and mushroom structures .",
    "we believe that these morphotypes are difficult to understand - and indeed do not emerge easily - in uniform environments assumed when using standard eden or dla type aggregation rules .",
    "incidentally , we checked that our approach reproduces pure dla patterns in the limit of infinite nutrient diffusion ( or turbulent convection ) , randomizing the nutrient mass over space .",
