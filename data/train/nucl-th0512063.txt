    ", we show that we have achieved a consistent description of elastic deuteron compton scattering which is valid from 0  mev up to @xmath55  mev . the advantage of our calculation with respect to refs .",
    "@xcite is that we obtain a good description of the data published below 60  mev .",
    "this improvement is of course connected to the correct static limit , which had not been obtained in those publications .",
    "therefore , other calculations reaching this limit and thus being manifestly gauge invariant are also able to describe the low - energy data well , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "however , we achieve good agreement also with high - energy data , measured around 94.2  mev  @xcite . in this energy regime the work of ref .  @xcite fails and the `` pion - less '' effective field theory used in @xcite is inapplicable .",
    "the authors of @xcite have also problems to describe the data in the backward direction without introducing surprisingly large isovector polarizabilities .",
    "it was already shown in  @xcite that the main difference between their approach and ours is in the energy dependence of the resonant compton multipoles , which is well captured in our calculation due to the inclusion of explicit @xmath33-resonance degrees of freedom , whereas the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite include the polarizabilities only via the leading and subleading terms of a taylor expansion in the photon energy .",
    "there are a number of ways to check the theoretical uncertainties of our calculation . as demonstrated in section  [ sec : wavefunctiondep ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : wavefunctiondep ] , the error induced by dependence on the deuteron wave function is tiny and may well be set to zero , while it is sizeable in the extractions of refs .",
    "@xcite . in section  [ sec : potentialdep ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : lochipt ] , we compared the cross - sections derived using either the av18-potential , or the much cruder one - pion exchange potential , regulated to reproduce the deuteron binding energy and @xmath56-scattering length .",
    "this may for the time being serve as lo potential of @xmath30eft .",
    "we find that the magnetic polarizability using this potential is less than @xmath57 larger than using av18 , and the electric polarizability decreases by practically the same amount . as it is safe to assume that av18 is a better representative of a fully self - consistent @xmath30eft potential at the level of our calculation ( next - to - leading order ) than one - pion exchange , we classify uncertainties induced by the potential as negligible",
    ". a third way to estimate the errors from the theory side is to compare to our previous calculation  @xcite . with the single - nucleon sector",
    "treated identically to the approach presented here , its only difference is that the interaction kernel is expanded perturbatively . as argued in section  [ sec : comparison ] , this approximation is justified in the rgime @xmath58 .",
    "there , both results should thus coincide up to higher - order corrections stemming from the different treatment of the two - nucleon sector .",
    "figure  [ fig:2parameterfit3 ] and in particular the extracted polarizabilities in table  [ tab : fits ] show that both approaches agree well within the statistical error , and do not deviate by more than @xmath59 .",
    "finally , higher - order corrections to the energy - dependence of the polarizabilities themselves were in sse estimated by nave dimensional analysis to be less than @xmath60  @xcite .",
    "all these interdependent estimates suggest a theory uncertainty of our extraction of @xmath61 as appropriate .",
    "this is comparable with the statistical error .",
    "having achieved a good description of all elastic deuteron compton - scattering data enabled us therefore to perform a global fit of the isoscalar polarizabilities to all existing data points , published in @xcite .",
    "our 2-parameter - fit results are ( see table  [ tab : fits ] ) @xmath62 we note that the numbers of eq .",
    "( [ eq : globalfitconclusion ] ) are very close to the fit results ( [ eq : expphghp ] ) for the proton polarizabilities , determined in  @xcite within the sse framework .",
    "this leaves little space for large isovector polarizabilities .",
    "furthermore they agree extraordinarily well with the isoscalar baldin - sum - rule value , eq .",
    "( [ eq : baldin ] ) .",
    "therefore , in order to reduce the statistical error , we repeated our fits including this constraint : @xmath63 combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : globalfitconclusion ] ) or  ( [ eq : globalfitbaldinconclusion ] ) , respectively , with the proton numbers of eq .",
    "( [ eq : expphghp ] ) , we obtained the neutron polarizabilities @xmath64 for the 2-parameter fit and @xmath65 for the 1-parameter fit including the baldin constraint . in both",
    "fits the fact that our deuteron compton - scattering calculation is applicable in the whole energy range from 0  mev to 100  mev enables us to include all data into our fit of the isoscalar polarizabilities . from these results",
    "we deduce that the neutron is paramagnetic and that proton and neutron behave rather similarly when exposed to external electromagnetic fields . in both points",
    "our deuteron compton calculation agrees with refs .",
    "@xcite and with the chiral perturbation theory prediction that contributions to the isovector polarizabilities only start beyond leading - one - loop order .",
    "this also justifies again that the two iso - scalar short - distance contributions to the electric and magnetic scalar polarizabilities in sec .",
    "[ sec : nonresonant ] are the smallest set which needs to be promoted by one order as in refs .",
    "@xcite to describe the data , given present uncertainties .",
    "our results for @xmath66 and @xmath41 are in excellent agreement with those from a comprehensive , experimental analysis of all quasi - free data  @xcite .",
    "that analysis did , however , not include elastic deuteron compton scattering due to the alleged discrepancy between theory and elastic @xmath2 experiments .",
    "this discrepancy has now been resolved , both in  @xcite and in the greens - function hybrid approach presented in this work .",
    "finally , we strongly advocate enlarging the data base for elastic compton scattering on the deuteron .",
    "if further experiments , as planned or running at tunl / hi@xmath67s  @xcite , at the s - dalinac  @xcite and at maxlab  @xcite , provide additional quality data below the pion threshold , the increased statistics would reduce the statistical error in our fit of the isoscalar polarizabilities . recall that the statistical errors of the two - parameter fit are larger than our theoretical uncertainty , and that the combined statistical and baldin - sum - rule error of the one - parameter fit is comparable to it .",
    "these errors are increased by the systematic experimental uncertainties which may be estimated more comfortably if more experiments using different methods were available .",
    "on the theory side , a wider effort is under way to describe elastic compton scattering on the proton , deuteron and @xmath68he from the thomson limit to well into the @xmath33-resonance region in one model - independent , unified framework .",
    "we focus at present on improving the accuracy by a full next - to - next - to - leading order calculation with nucleons , pions and the @xmath1 as dynamical , effective degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "clearly , reduced error bars in coherent compton scattering from the deuteron would enable us to quantify by how much proton and neutron polarizabilities differ .",
