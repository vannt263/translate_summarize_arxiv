    "the uncertainty principle has been regarded as a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics .",
    "it asserts that we can not get the precise values of two physical observables in a quantum state , unless they are compatible .",
    "the well - known version of this principle was formulated by heisenberg in 1927 , namely ,  @xcite @xmath0 a more general form of it can be written as @xmath1 \\ket{\\psi } \\right|}}{2},\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the error with which measurement of operator @xmath3 is carried out , and @xmath4 is the disturbance on the following measurement of operator @xmath5 caused by measurement of @xmath3 . in",
    ", @xmath6 and @xmath7 can be interpreted as error and disturbance when @xmath3 and @xmath5 are position and momentum operators .",
    "mathematically , comes from the robertson s uncertainty relation  @xcite : @xmath8 \\ket{\\psi } \\right|}}{2},\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the standard derivation of observable @xmath10 in a quantum state @xmath11 .",
    "note that while , usually regarded as a rigorous version of heisenberg s uncertainty principle  @xcite , can be proven mathematically , the justification of relation is currently on hot debate because additional conditions have been used in its derivation @xcite . more importantly , several experiments showed that is violated  @xcite .",
    "thus , the trade - off relation that the higher the precision of measuring @xmath3 , the stronger the disturbance on @xmath5 can not be well - captured by .",
    "many important works in this area have been done , but the definitions of error and disturbance are still not settled  @xcite .",
    "ozawa used noise - operator based error definition and proposed a `` universally valid error - disturbance relation ''  @xcite : @xmath12 \\ket{\\psi } \\right|}}{2}.\\ ] ] this uncertainty relation was later verified experimentally  @xcite and inspired a lot of work on uncertainty relations  @xcite , but some shortcomings were also pointed out  @xcite . for example , it seems to violate the proposed operational constraint that the error and disturbance should be non - zero if the outcome distribution is deviated from what is expected according to born s rule  @xcite .",
    "using distance between distributions is another way to quantifying measurement errors  @xcite , busch _",
    "_ proved the original heisenberg s error - disturbance relation in by defining error and disturbance as figures of merit characteristic of the measuring devices  @xcite , which generated a debate over different approaches used in formalizing uncertainty relations  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a straightforward definition of error and disturbance .",
    "the key observation is that given an arbitrary quantum state , the measurement statistics of a measurement operation on that state is unchanged if and only if we perform an additional compatible measurement to the state beforehand .",
    "thus , we may define the disturbance of @xmath13 ( measurement of operator @xmath5 ) due to @xmath14 ( measurement of operator @xmath3 ) as the distance between the two probability distributions of the measurement outcomes due to @xmath13 and @xmath15 maximized over all possible input quantum states .",
    "we introduce the definitions of error and disturbance in and report a few basic properties of these quantities in .",
    "then , in , we prove the error - disturbance trade - off relation for the case of @xmath16-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "in particular , we derive a sharp lower bound of the sum of error and disturbance .",
    "we also give the trade - off relation in @xmath17-dimensional hilbert space for a special but important case .",
    "finally , we draw a few conclusions in .",
    "suppose one is given a density matrix @xmath18 in a @xmath17-dimensional hilbert space with @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath14 be the projective measurements of operator @xmath3 with rank - one projectors .",
    "( unless otherwise stated , all measurements in this paper are associated with rank - one projectors . note that our discussion can be easily extended to the case of a general positive operator - valued measurement .",
    "we restrain from doing so to avoid unnecessary notational and indexing complications . )",
    "the probability distribution obtained from applying @xmath14 to @xmath18 is given by the vector @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the rank - one projector corresponding to the @xmath22^th^ measurement outcome .",
    "we now consider measuring @xmath18 using another projective measurement @xmath23 before feeding the resultant state to @xmath13 .",
    "we write the probability distribution of the measurement outcomes of @xmath23 by @xmath24 . more importantly",
    ", the probability distribution of the final measurement outcomes of @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the rank - one projector corresponding to the @xmath22^th^ measurement outcome of @xmath29 .",
    "in general , @xmath30 is different from @xmath31 as measurement changes the state of a quantum system .",
    "we would like to know how a change in the intermediate measurement @xmath29 affects the change of @xmath31 through their classical statistics of their measurement outcomes only . with this motivation in mind , for any given metric @xmath32 of an euclidean space , we define the * state - dependent error * between @xmath33 and @xmath24 , and the * state - dependent disturbance * between @xmath34 and @xmath35 as @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively .",
    "since our goal is to study the maximum pointwise deviation in the distribution of the measurement outcomes , we use the metric based on the infinity norm , namely , @xmath38    we now define the * state - independent error * and * state - independent disturbance * by @xmath39 and @xmath40 from now on , the terms `` error '' and `` disturbance '' refer to the state - independent versions unless otherwise stated .",
    "note that these definitions meet the proposed operational constraint @xcite for @xmath41 if and only if @xmath42 and @xmath43 if and only if @xmath44 .",
    "finally , to obtain a trade - off relation between error and disturbance in one measurement , that is , to find out how much we need to sacrifice on one to lower the other , just as what heisenberg did , we introduce the * state - independent overall error * @xmath45 clearly , @xmath46 .",

    "similarly , we have @xmath51 note that the maximum of @xmath52 can be attained by a pure state @xmath18 ; and similarly for @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    [ prop : pp1 ] the error satisfies @xmath55 for any @xmath56 , with equality if and only if @xmath57 for some @xmath22 . in addition",

    "this result gives a lower bound of the overall error and the sum of error and disturbance , and therefore provide a version of uncertainty principle in the case of two - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "we could make @xmath164 by choosing @xmath165 .",
    "this means that the overall error is the largest when @xmath166 and @xmath167 are mutually unbiased .",

    "it shows that the values of @xmath168 and @xmath169 do not change smoothly because we have absolute values , maxima and minima in the definitions of error and disturbance .",

    "however , the same conclusion in still works in some special but interesting cases .",
    "[ thm : thm2 ] for all @xmath184 , if eigenstates of @xmath3 and @xmath5 form a pair of mutually unbiased bases ( mub ) , then we have @xmath185 when @xmath186 = @xmath166 , the equality holds .",

    "moreover , tells us again when @xmath170 , the sum of error and disturbance is minimized .",
    "it is natural to ask if is true for general measurement operations when the hilbert space dimension @xmath201 .",
    "our numerical simulations find that while does not hold when @xmath201 , the theorem seems to be correct by adopting the following slightly relaxed definition of @xmath202 , @xmath203 where the minimum is over all possible projective measurements with rank one projectors @xmath204 corresponding to the measurement operation @xmath13 . this relaxed definition of @xmath205 means that we only distinguish between the classical probability distributions resulting from measurements @xmath14 and @xmath13 with no regard to the labeling of different measurement outcomes . with this relaxed definition for @xmath205 , we make the following conjecture .",

    "our sharp lower bound @xmath211 will then serve as a importance physical quantity characterizing the trade - off between error and disturbance in consecutive measurement process .",
    "to summarize , we have introduced new definitions of error and disturbance in quantum measurement that are both state- and eigenvalue - independent .",
