    "quantum field theory ( qft ) on the anti - de sitter ( ads ) space - time has come today to the general attention because of the role that ads geometry plays at several places in modern theoretical physics @xcite .",
    "ads qft is also believed to provide an infrared regularization @xcite that can be useful for instance to understand the longstanding problems of gauge qft s . from a more conceptual viewpoint , this regain of interest has led some authors to realize the need for a deeper setting of ads qft and to investigate the consequences of general principles which , in spite of the difficulties generated by the peculiar geometry of ads , might lead to a reasonable approach to the interacting fields on this spacetime ; such an approach should of course include the case of ads free fields , whose preliminary versions were given in early works @xcite @xcite . in this spirit three recent works on general ads qft can be mentioned .",
    "@xcite uses the framework of observable algebras , but without assuming local commutativity from the outset .",
    "instead the property of `` passivity '' ( in the sense of @xcite ) is postulated for the vacuum , and a remarkable proportion of the more standard properties is shown to follow .",
    "indeed we argue in our final remarks that , heuristically speaking , their assumptions imply those of the present paper .",
    "two other works @xcite and @xcite ( motivated by @xcite ) independently exhibit explicit relationships of a general type between ads qft and conformal qft in the minkowskian boundary of ads : while @xcite also pertains to the framework of local observable algebras , @xcite relies on a limited use of analytic @xmath0-point functions of local fields in a wightman - type approach ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is the complete setting of such a wightman - type framework for ads qft and the derivation of a number of general results for interacting fields belonging to that framework which are the purpose of the present paper .    0.1 cm it may be useful to start by recalling how ads qft",
    "is rendered difficult by the lack of the global hyperbolicity property of the underlying manifold .",
    "this manifests itself in two ways : there exist closed timelike curves on the ads manifold ( in particular geodesics ) and there is a `` boundary '' at spacelike infinity .",
    "the first problem is commonly avoided by considering the covering of the manifold ; the second fact implies that the standard procedure of canonical quantization for free fields ( see e.g. @xcite ) can not be used , since there does not exist a global cauchy surface and information can flow in from spacelike infinity . to construct a viable qft under these circumstances",
    "one may need to specify suitable boundary conditions at infinity . to this end ,",
    "the nice idea in @xcite was to use the conformal embedding of the ads manifold in the einstein static universe , which is a globally hyperbolic space - time .",
    "it has been then possible ( with some restrictions ) to produce a class of boundary conditions that render the resulting ads qft well defined .",
    "unfortunately the procedure is very special and tricky , and can work at best for free field theories .    generally speaking , a well known problem when studying qft on gravitational backgrounds",
    "is the absence of a criterion to select the physically meaningful states .",
    "there are indeed infinitely many inequivalent representations of the same field algebra and it is in general impossible to characterize the physically relevant vacuum states as , for instance , fundamental states for the energy operator , since the very concept of energy as a global quantity is in general not defined .",
    "however , an important aspect of the energy concept which keeps its full value is the notion of energy `` relative to an observer whose world - line is an orbit of a one - parameter group of isometries of the spacetime '' : for such observers , the usual quantum notion of energy , represented by the generator of time - translations , is in fact applicable with respect to the proper - time parameter . therefore the properties of energy - positivity and temperature ( i.e. the notions of ground state and kms - state ) are meaningful _ relatively to such observers _ and technically characterized by relevant analyticity properties of the correlation functions of the fields in the corresponding complexified orbits .",
    "of course , this approach of the energy concept remains particularly simple because we have to deal with curved spacetimes of holomorphic type , such as the de sitter and ads quadrics .    in a previous work dealing with qft on de sitter spacetime ( @xcite )",
    ", we had shown that the absence of global energy operators could _ in that case _ be successfully replaced by appropriate global analyticity properties of the @xmath0-point functions of the fields in `` natural '' tuboidal domains : the latter played the same role as the tube domains resulting from energy - positivity in the case of minkowskian fields . moreover a thermal interpretation of these qft for all geodesic ( as well as uniformly accelerated ) observers could then be proved as a byproduct of these global analyticity properties , thus providing an extension of the bisognano - wichmann analyticity property obtained in the minkowskian case @xcite , or in physical terms of the `` unruh effect '' .",
    "surprisingly , in the ads case , the situation concerning energy operators turns out to be more fortunate than in the de sitter case , and in fact quite favourable !",
    "this is because there exist _ two classes _ of time - like orbits of _ `` generic '' one - parameter isometry groups _ , namely the class of elliptic orbits and the class of hyperbolic orbits , also supplemented by a `` boundary - type '' class of parabolic orbits .",
    "the hyperbolic orbits of ads represent uniformly accelerated motions similar to _ all _ the geodesic or uniformly accelerated motions of de sitter spacetime : the corresponding complexified orbits , which are complex hyperbolae , are thus also `` plagued '' by a natural periodicity in the _ imaginary part _ of their proper - time parameter , which forbids the positivity of the corresponding energy operator ( but can support at best a kms - condition whose temperature is related to the radius of the hyperbola and thereby to the acceleration ) . on the contrary , the ( complexified ) elliptic orbits ,",
    "whose class contains geodesic as well as uniformly accelerated motions , only present the peculiarity of periodicity in the _ real part _ of their proper - time parameter : this pathology already mentioned above ( namely the `` time loops '' ) is cured by considering qft on the _ universal covering _ of ads ; in fact in all the following , this covering space will appear as much more natural than ads itself for the setting of interacting fields . at any rate , since there is no geometrical periodicity in the imaginary part of the proper - time of the elliptic orbits and since the corresponding one - parameter groups have no orbits of other type , their generators can be considered as genuine global energy generators : nothing forbids one to postulate the positivity of the corresponding energy operators , expressed technically by relevant analyticity properties in half - planes of the proper - time parameter .",
    "so , as in the wightman axiomatics of minkowskian qft , it is still natural here to postulate the spectral condition for all the generators of time - like elliptic orbits , the latter playing the same role as the time - like straight - lines ( or uniform motions ) in the minkowskian spacetime .",
    "we note that such a condition has been proposed in fronsdal s group - theoretical study @xcite of klein - gordon ads qft . in this connection",
    "one must also quote @xcite whose authors point out the discrepancy between the elliptic and hyperbolic ads trajectories and give arguments for attributing to them respectively a zero - temperature and a finite temperature specified in terms of the acceleration .",
    "another postulate which will play a crucial role in our approach is an adaptation of the property of local commutativity ( or microcausality ) .",
    "it still appears as natural for the covering of ads space - time , in spite of its lack of global - hyperbolicity , while it is harder to justify on the `` pure '' ads space - time itself , because of the time - loop phenomenon .",
    "however we may regard a field theory on the pure ads space - time as just a special case of one defined on its covering .",
    "another justification is also provided by @xcite .    after having set the relevant geometrical notions in sections [ pre ] and [ tub ]",
    ", we shall propose in section  [ hyp ] a plausible set of hypotheses for an interacting ads qft , among which the positivity of the spectrum of the above mentioned energy operators , ads - covariance and an adaptation of microcausality .",
    "the spectral hypothesis readily implies that the @xmath0-point correlation functions admit analytic continuations in tuboidal domains in the cartesian product of @xmath0 copies of ( the covering of ) the complexified ads manifold .",
    "these analyticity properties of the correlation functions parallel as closely as possible what happens in wightman qft @xcite , where the analyticity of the correlation functions in similar tubular domains is analogously obtained from the positivity of the spectrum of the energy .",
    "these domains are described in section [ tub ] .",
    "unfortunately the @xmath0-point tuboids are rather complicated geometrical objects and , at present , can be given a simple description only in the case @xmath1 , namely for the two - point functions .",
    "note however that for general @xmath0 they contain `` flat domains '' corresponding to all points moving on orbits of _ the same one - parameter isometry group _",
    ", whose description is identical with those of the corresponding sets in complex minkowskian spacetime ; in @xcite , these flat domains have played a useful role in the construction of the `` asymptotic forms '' of ads qft , recognized as lscher - mack - type theories @xcite on the asymptotic cone of ads , in correspondence with conformal qft in minkowskian spacetime of one dimension less . at the end of our section [ tub ] ( subsection [ comptub ] ) ,",
    "we have tried to give a summary of some analogies and discrepancies between the @xmath0-point tuboids of complex ads and the corresponding ones of complex minkowski space .",
    "one of the interesting points of the ads geometry is that there exist families of submanifolds that can be identified with minkowski space - times in one dimension less ( branes ) : as a matter of fact , these submanifolds contain all the two - plane sections of parabolic - type of the ads - quadric mentioned above as the third class of timelike orbits .",
    "this very fact has raised recently a large interest @xcite .",
    "our construction guarantees the possibility of considering restrictions of ads quantum fields to these `` poincar branes '' and obtaining this way completely well - defined minkowskian qft s .",
    "it is perhaps worthwhile to stress that this result , described in section [ parsec ] , is not as obvious as the well - known restrictibility of minkowskian theories to lower dimensionality space - times because of the more complicated geometry . from a geometrical viewpoint",
    ", the conformal theories obtained in @xcite under asymptotic scaling assumptions then also appear as limits of the previous minkowskian qft s when the corresponding parabolic sections tend to infinity .    in any approach of qft",
    ", the case of two - point functions deserves a special study .",
    "this is why we give in section [ 2pt ] and in appendix [ ap2pt ] a complete characterization of the ads two - point functions ; the latter are actually maximally analytic , exactly as in the minkowski @xcite and de sitter @xcite cases . as usual",
    "this permits the constructions of generalized free fields and their wick powers which fulfill all the hypotheses .",
    "this study also provides the opportunity of displaying some strange implications of the postulate of microcausality in the `` pure ads '' case .",
    "in fact , the discrepancy between the pure ads spacetime and the covering of ads appears in a characteristic way in the classification of the two - point functions ; it is revealed by the property of uniformity ( or nonuniformity ) of these functions in their analyticity domain @xmath2 $ ] in the complex plane of the cosine of the ads invariant distance .",
    "these phenomena introduce the more general problem of characterizing the interacting qft s on the pure ads spacetime with respect to those on the covering , which will be briefly discussed in our outlook ( section  [ o ] ) .    in section [ bwa ]",
    "we derive from our postulates the property of bisognano - wichmann analyticity in all the hyperbolic orbits corresponding to the class of uniformly accelerated motions mentioned earlier , or in other words the `` ads - unruh effect '' : an accelerated observer of the ads world whose world - line belongs to that class will perceive a thermal bath of particles with inverse temperature equal to @xmath3 times the radius of the corresponding hyperbolic orbit . we note that this result , first described in a special free - field theory in @xcite , has been also justified in the general framework of algebraic qft in @xcite , by taking the principle of passivity of @xcite as a starting point .",
    "we also note that , in spite of the peculiarities of the global geometry of ads , this result is similar to the one proved in @xcite for minkowskian qft and in @xcite for its extension to de sitterian qft .",
    "section  [ wr ] is devoted to the ads version of the `` euclidean '' field theory and to the corresponding osterwalder - schrader reconstruction on the covering of ads .",
    "section  [ o ] contains some final remarks among which a brief discussion of the relationship of @xcite and the present work .",
    "we start with some notations and some well - known facts .",

    "in particular @xmath35 , @xmath36 ( i.e. @xmath27 is simply connected ) for @xmath37 .",
    "it follows that for @xmath38 the _ covering space _ of @xmath27 is @xmath39 itself .",

    "this yields the following parametrization of @xmath41 : @xmath55 the diffeomorphism @xmath56 , defined by lifting @xmath46 on the covering @xmath57 of @xmath47 provides a global coordinate system on @xmath40 .",

    "it is clear that since @xmath22 acts transitively on @xmath26 the diffeomorphism @xmath46 can be transported by any transformation of the group @xmath22 ; it follows that @xmath24 also acts transitively on @xmath40 .",

    "first of all , we wish to emphasize the peculiar thermal aspects of `` generic '' field theories on ads or its covering , which are strongly related to the geometry of the ads quadric , namely to the existence of uniformly accelerated motions on three types of trajectories : while the elliptic and parabolic observers perceive a world at zero temperature ( satisfying a condition of energy - positivity ) in spite of the fact that the acceleration can take all values between zero and @xmath187 , the hyperbolic observers perceive an unruh - type temperature effect growing from zero to infinity when the acceleration grows from @xmath187 to infinity .    our subsequent remarks concern some important peculiarities of qft s on the _ pure _ ads spacetime with respect to those on its covering , which appeared in the study of general two - point functions ( see section [ 2pt ] ) , namely :    \\i ) the vanishing of the commutator vacuum expectation value in the region of spacelike separation @xmath1208 implies its vanishing in the region of time - like separation @xmath1209 , which we called the `` region of exotic causal separation '' ,    \\ii ) the periodicity condition on time - like geodesics implies that the two - point function is a holomorphic function of @xmath1210 in the domain @xmath1211 $ ] itself instead of its covering . in the free - field case , this selects the legendre functions @xmath1212 for which @xmath1213 integer , which results in a quantization of the mass parameter @xmath1214 .",
    "more generally all the fields on the pure ads spacetime have two - point functions which are ( positive ) superpositions of the free - field functions @xmath1215 with integer indices @xmath201 .",
    "these peculiarities suggest respectively the following questions which may be linked together and deserve to be studied in further works .",
    "\\a ) does local commutativity , formulated as the vanishing of the commutator in the region of spacelike separation implies its vanishing in the region of exotic causal separation ( or `` exotic causality '' ) ?",
    "\\b ) do the axioms of section [ hyp ] applied to the pure ads spacetime exclude the existence of non - trivial interacting qft ?    it has in fact been noted in @xcite that the region of spacelike separation does not really deserve that name in the pure ads case , since pairs of points in that region can also be connected by classes of _ non - geodesic _ timelike paths ; as it is stated , the condition of local commutativity therefore appears as a strong constraint which would force the interactions to respect the time - periodicity of the geometry .",
    "one can then also say that the condition of exotic locality would represent a constraint of similar nature acting at odd number of half - periods of time , and that is why one could possibly expect it to be a consequence of local commutativity .",
    "we know that , besides generalized free fields , their wick polynomials are allowed to exist , since their @xmath0-point functions , which are combinations of products of two - point functions , do satisfy the required ( periodic ) analyticity properties in the relevant tubes @xmath1216 of the pure ads spacetime . however , if we think of nontrivial interacting fields in terms of perturbation theory and consider feynman - type convolution products of free two - point functions involving not only products but integrals on the ads spacetime , one can show that the constraints of periodic analyticity can not be maintained in general : in particular the action of retarded propagators can be seen to propagate the interaction in the covering tubes @xmath1217 .",
    "so one could formulate as a conjecture , that there might be no other qft s on the pure ads spacetime than the ones previously mentioned , which would then also entail ( as a byproduct ) a positive answer to our question a ) . however , there is at the moment no genuine proof relying on the axioms of section [ hyp ] that such a conjecture is valid .",
    "we end these remarks with a brief comparison of the formalism of this paper with that proposed by @xcite .",
    "a difficulty is of course the usual gap between a formulation based on fields and one based on local algebras .",
    "this difficulty is compounded in the ads case by the lack of a translation group . in @xcite the pure ads , and not its covering space , is considered . from the principle of passivity of the vacuum , the authors succeed in deriving the positivity of the energy , the existence of a ctp operator ( both in the same sense as here ) , and the commutativity of operators localized in opposite wedges . if we suppose that , in terms of fields , these results correspond to the tempered spectral , covariance , and positivity conditions , and a portion of local commutativity , then , by remark [ extloc ] ( section  [ hyp ] ) , this implies full local commutativity , and thus all our axioms .",
