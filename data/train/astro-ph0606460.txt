    "most spiral galaxies have large - scale bars , and any complete picture of galaxies must include the impact of bars on their evolution .",
    "bars are important because they are an obvious mechanism for funneling gas and dust to the centers of galaxies : gas clouds orbiting in the disk lose angular momentum as they encounter the bar , thereby sinking towards the galaxy s center @xcite .",
    "bars are therefore expected to play a major role in circumnuclear star formation , bulge growth , and the fueling of the central , supermassive black hole .",
    "bar - driven radial gas inflow should drive large quantities of gas and dust into the central regions of galaxies , thereby increasing the central gas concentration of barred galaxies relative to unbarred galaxies .",
    "observations by @xcite and @xcite support this view , finding higher concentrations of molecular gas in the central kiloparsec of barred galaxies than in unbarred galaxies . as higher gas density",
    "is empirically correlated with higher star formation rates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there should be a correlation between bar - driven inflow and central star formation .",
    "observational evidence for enhanced nuclear or circumnuclear star formation in barred galaxies provides broad support for this picture @xcite .",
    "it has long been speculated that this same radial gas inflow could provide active galactic nuclei ( agn ) with fuel @xcite .",
    "there is so far no evidence , though , that bars ( large - scale or nuclear ) are the primary fuel source for agn : not all active galaxies are barred , not all barred galaxies are active , and , in fact , well - matched samples of active and inactive galaxies have the same bar fraction @xcite .",
    "@xcite speculate that this is because radially - transported gas is prevented from reaching the nucleus .",
    "if bars are indeed fueling galaxies circumnuclear regions , then this should be reflected in the morphology of the cold circumnuclear interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "@xcite establish a nuclear dust morphology classification system with four spiral classes ( grand design , tightly wound , loosely wound , and chaotic spiral ) and two non - spiral classes ( chaotic and no structure ) to quantify differences between various galaxy types .",
    "@xcite find no differences in the nuclear dust structure of active and inactive galaxies .",
    "this study does find evidence that nuclear grand design spirals are primarily found in barred galaxies and that these grand design spirals connect to large scale dust lanes in barred galaxies .",
    "likewise , @xcite primarily find tightly wound nuclear spirals in unbarred galaxies .",
    "all of these studies of the role of bars in fueling central star formation or black holes simply compare `` barred '' versus `` unbarred '' galaxies .",
    "this discretization glosses over , and over simplifies , the long - known continuum of barstrengths @xcite .",
    "one early way of quantifying the strength of a bar is the deprojected bar ellipticity @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage of using the bar ellipticity is that defining the bar ",
    ", its exact dimensions  is a somewhat subjective process @xcite .",
    "@xcite introduce the parameter @xmath4 , which is a function of the bar axis ratio , and therefore susceptible to the same systematics as @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite , by expanding on the method of @xcite , circumvent this problem by using a force ratio , which they call @xmath0 .",
    "assuming that the light traces the underlying mass distribution , they use near - infrared images to calculate a map of a galaxy s potential .",
    "from these potential maps , and with some assumptions about the characteristic scale - height , they then calculate the tangential force @xmath5 and mean ( axisymmetric ) radial force @xmath6 .",
    "they define the ratio map @xmath7 as @xmath8 this ratio map has the property that in each of four quadrants @xmath7 reaches a local extremum .",
    "letting @xmath9 be the absolute value of such an extremum in the @xmath10th quadrant , the barstrength @xmath0 is defined as @xmath11 the cited uncertainties on @xmath0 are a measure of how much @xmath12 varies by quadrant . from a comparison with the three barstrength classes defined by @xcite ( unbarred sa ,",
    "weakly barred sab , and strongly barred sb ) , @xcite find a reasonable correlation between the rc3 bar classification and @xmath0 , although with substantial scatter . in particular , sa galaxies have @xmath13 , sab galaxies have @xmath14 , and sb galaxies have @xmath15 .",
    "the most strongly barred galaxies have @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "while we adopt @xmath0 as the best available measure of barstrength , we note that @xcite shows that both the quadrupole moment ( strength ) and the pattern speed play an important role in how effectively the bar drives mass towards the center of the galaxy .",
    "pattern speed , however , is much more difficult to measure than parameters that can be calculated from photometric data .",
    "@xcite used @xmath0 and the nuclear classifications of @xcite to compare the barstrengths and nuclear dust morphologies of 48 galaxies with archival hubble space telescope ( hst ) data .",
    "he found that grand design nuclear spirals are primarily found in strongly barred galaxies , while axisymmetric tightly wound nuclear spirals are exclusively found in galaxies with @xmath17 . with a larger sample and reconsideration of the circumnuclear dust morphology classification at the smallest scales ,",
    "we examine how nuclear dust structure varies with barstrength .",
    "we identify 75 galaxies , described in ",
    "[ sec : data ] , with a measured barstrength @xmath0 from the literature . to analyze the dust morphology",
    ", we create `` structure maps '' from archival hst data using the technique of @xcite as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : smap ] .",
    "we then classify the galaxies according to a refined version of the classification scheme proposed in @xcite , as described in  [ sec : nuc ] . the main difference between the classification scheme used here and that of @xcite is a stronger focus on the central - most regions of the galaxy .",
    "we discuss our results in  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we began our study with a data set of 127 galaxies with both a measured barstrength ( primarily from the ohio state university bright galaxy survey ( osubgs ) by @xcite ) and archival hst data .",
    "the hst images were obtained with wfpc2 , with the exception of three images from the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) , and most employed either the f606w or f814w filters .",
    "the galaxies studied by the osubgs were selected to be a representative sample of the nearby universe ; specifically , based on the rc3 t - type distribution ( @xmath18  t  @xmath19 , or s0/a to sm ) to ensure there is no morphological selection bias @xcite .",

    "we classify the galaxies according to a refined version of the nuclear classification scheme presented in @xcite .",
    "the main distinction between the scheme used here and the original one is that we have a stronger emphasis on the central - most regions of the galaxy ; other differences between the scheme used here and the one in @xcite are discussed below .",
    "the structure maps used for classification are scaled to have a width and height equal to 5% of @xmath1 .",
    "the classification scheme uses six categories :    grand design ( gd ) : : :    two spiral arms symmetric about a 180@xmath39 rotation ,    at least one of which extends all the way to the unresolved nucleus of    the galaxy , and at least one of which is a dominant feature tightly wound ( tw ) : : :    coherent spiral arm structure over a large range in radius ; pitch    angle less than or equal to 10@xmath39 loosely wound ( lw ) : : :    coherent spiral arm structure over a large range in radius ; pitch    angle greater than 10@xmath39 chaotic spiral ( cs ) : : :    unambiguous evidence for spiral arm structure with a unique sense of    chirality , but not coherent over a large range in radius chaotic ( c ) : : :    dust structure with no evidence of spiral structure no structure ( n ) : : :    no discernible dust structure within the central region    examples of each classification are given in figure  [ fig : proto ] , and the classifications for all of the galaxies in our sample are given in table  [ tbl : data ] .",
    "there are several subtle , yet important , refinements to the original classification scheme .",
    "first , the classification is based on a region that scales with the size of the galaxy ( the central 5% of @xmath1 ) rather than within the central @xmath40 used by @xcite .",
    "most changes in classification can be attributed to this more physically defined focus .",
    "the largest difference in an individual class is the requirement that for an object to be classified as gd , at least one of the arms must be observed to extend to the nucleus of the galaxy .",
    "for this reason , some galaxies previously classified as gd now have a different classification ( e.g. , ngc1365 ) .",
    "we comment on this distinction in greater detail in  [ sec : gd ] .",
    "we also quantify the distinction between tightly and loosely wound circumnuclear spirals by setting 10@xmath39  as the delineation between `` small '' and `` large '' pitch angles .",
    "this division roughly corresponds to that of sb galaxies ( kennicutt 1981 ) .",
    "previously , the differentiation between tw and lw was done purely by eye , and also took into account arm morphology .",
    "specifically , for a nuclear spiral to be classified as `` tightly wound , '' the arms had to be traceable through at least one complete revolution , and therefore the classification was potentially subject to signal - to - noise ratio bias ( for an arm to remain coherent about an entire revolution , and thus be classified as tw , a higher snr was needed ) .",
    "we measure pitch angles with an interactive pgplot program which fits logarithmic spirals to a deprojected image of the structure map .",
    "five points of increasing radius on a single prominent spiral arm of the galaxy are chosen within an annulus given by 2575% of the bulge radius , or of 1% of @xmath1 if the galaxy is either bulgeless or there is no available effective bulge radius data . in",
    "that if @xcite report a non - zero bulge radius , then it is used , rather than taking the minimum of @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "this is because at larger radii , there is more likely to be a coherent arm with a measurable pitch angle . ]",
    "the program then fits logarithmic spirals to each consecutive pair of points , averaging the resulting four pitch angles to give the pitch angle for the entire arm .",
    "as found by @xcite for large - scale spirals , the nuclear spirals are not well fit by logarithmic spirals  a given arm does not have constant pitch angle as a function of radius .",
    "still , this method yields an `` average '' pitch angle for the arm .",
    "the observed non - constant pitch angle along a spiral arm implies that the region is experiencing differential rotation which is inconsistent with constant rotational velocity @xcite .",
    "we also note that the pitch angle often varies between different arms in a single galaxy . notwithstanding these caveats ,",
    "we find that this method suffices for determining whether or not the pitch angle is above or below 10@xmath39 , thus differentiating between tw and lw nuclear spirals .",
    "finally , the `` central region '' used in classifying the n class of objects was previously defined as a `` few hundred parsecs '' @xcite .",
    "we have clarified this so that the central region is specific to each galaxy , namely , a circle of radius @xmath21 . while in general the entire region within @xmath43 is used for classification , the region within @xmath21 is also used as a guide in deciding between different classifications ; if a galaxy is seen to have a different morphology at small radii than at large radii , such as is seen in ngc1068 , the classification at small radii is used .",
    "this decision also led to changes in the classifications of several galaxies from those reported in previous papers .",
    "though this distinction is subject to the definition of @xmath21 , only two galaxies , ngc1068 and ngc3227 , would have their classifications changed ( lw to c and cs to c , respectively ) if @xmath21 were defined to be 1% of @xmath1 for all galaxies , rather than the minimum used in equation  ( [ eqn : rc ] ) . despite this",
    ", we choose to keep the more physically motivated definition of @xmath21 for reasons discussed in  [ sec : data ] .",
    "to quantify the amount of relative structure galaxies , we calculated the root mean squared ( rms ) of the pixel - to - pixel variations of the galaxies structure maps within @xmath21 .",
    "the more dust structure or star formation in a galaxy , the higher the dust contrast in the structure map , and therefore the higher the rms .",
    "we assign an uncertainty to the rms by calculating the standard deviation of 11 measurements of the rms within a circular aperture ranging in radius from @xmath44 to @xmath45 in increments on @xmath46 .",
    "we further define @xmath47 to be the average of these 11 measured rms values .",
    "the variation on @xmath47 is found to be no more than 5% for any object .",
    "the measured rms values and uncertainties for each galaxy are given in table  [ tbl : data ] .",
    "because the structure map is sensitive to structures on the scale of the psf , rather than some physical scale , there may be a strong distance - dependent bias in @xmath47 .",
    "we therefore tested how @xmath47 changes for a given galaxy upon changing the resolution using a test sample of nine galaxies with high enough resolutions to meet our resolution and signal - to - noise cuts ( see  [ sec : data ] ) even after being convolved with a gaussian with a standard deviation of 2.6 pixels , which corresponds to more than doubling their distance . for each object , we convolved both the image and the psf with a gaussian with a standard deviation of 1.02.6 pixels ( in 0.1 pixel increments ) , from which a set of 17 degraded structure maps were constructed .",
    "an example of this degradation for ngc4321 is shown in figure  [ fig : rmsdegrade ] .",
    "we then calculated @xmath47 ( and uncertainty , as described above ) for each of these degraded structure maps .",
    "while @xmath47 did change for each object , the change was found to be comparable with the calculated uncertainties for any given structure map .",
    "this implies that at these scales , the dust structure is roughly scale - invariant , in agreement with the findings of @xcite that the power spectra of dust structure becomes relatively shallow at small scales . we thus conclude that @xmath47 does not contain a distance - dependent bias and employ it below to compare different subsamples of galaxies .",
    "once the galaxies are classified , we have sets of barstrengths @xmath0 and structure map rms values @xmath47 for each nuclear classification .",
    "we then want to answer the question of how likely it is that the objects of a given classification are drawn from the same parent distribution as other galaxies .",
    "the standard method for comparing two arbitrary distributions is the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test , which calculates the maximum vertical separation @xmath48 between two cumulative distributions .",
    "the larger the k - s distance @xmath48 for two samples , the less likely the two distributions represent the same parent population .",
    "@xmath48 only takes on discrete values , namely , multiples of @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the number of elements in the two samples a and b under comparison . to compare two samples ,",
    "we first calculate the distance @xmath48 between the two distributions .",
    "then , for 10,000 trials , we compare this @xmath48 to the distance between two samples of size @xmath50 and @xmath51 drawn from a uniform distribution , yielding a probability that the two samples are in fact drawn from the same distribution .",
    "these probabilities do not change significantly when errors on @xmath0 or @xmath52 are taken into account . in the event that the two samples intersect",
    ", we exclude the shared galaxies from both samples in order to do the comparison .    in the few cases where both sample sizes small",
    ", we use the wilcoxon rank - sum test instead of the k - s test .",
    "the wilcoxon test compares two samples a and b of size @xmath50 and @xmath51 , with @xmath53 , where the `` true '' mean values of a and b are @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively . letting the sum of the ranks in sample a",
    "be @xmath56 , the probability that @xmath57 is equal to the probability that the sum of the ranks of @xmath50 randomly chosen elements ( from a set of size @xmath58 ) is @xmath59 , while the probability that @xmath60 is equal to the probability that the sum of ranks is @xmath61 .",
    "our classifications and measurements of @xmath47 are summarized in table  [ tbl : data ] .",
    "there is a 2% probability that the tightly wound ( tw ) nuclear dust spirals have the same underlying distribution of barstrength as the rest of the sample .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : tw ] , tw nuclear spirals are found primarily  although not exclusively  in weakly barred galaxies .",
    "as the tw class is defined to be those dust spirals with pitch angle @xmath62  10@xmath39 , this is consistent with the idea that a galaxy which is axisymmetric at large scales ( i.e. , has a small @xmath0 ) will either have high differential rotation or simply that the central regions of these galaxies can not be highly disrupted @xcite .",
    "all four late - type galaxies in our sample ( t  @xmath63  6 ) have chaotic circumnuclear dust structure , as shown in the right - hand panel of figure  [ fig : latet ] .",
    "no such differences were found for any other nuclear class , ( corresponding to a hubble type of sab ) , this is not significant . ] as shown in the left - hand panel of figure  [ fig : latet ] and figure  [ fig : allqb ] .",
    "as previous studies have suggested a connection between large - scale bars and grand design nuclear spirals , we begin our discussion of strongly barred galaxies below with a consideration of grand design nuclear spirals .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations suggest that large - scale bars can lead to the formation of grand design nuclear spirals @xcite , and several observational studies support this hypothesis @xcite . with our focus on the very central regions of nuclear spirals ,",
    "we find that this is in fact not the case : the grand design nuclear spirals described in  [ sec : nuc ] are _ not _ preferentially found in strongly barred galaxies .",
    "we find , however , that symmetric two - arm spiral structure is common at larger scales in strongly barred galaxies . to differentiate between circumnuclear grand design spirals found at different scales ,",
    "we hereafter refer to grand design structure at small radii , defined as gd in  [ sec : nuc ] , as sgd structure ( small grand design ) , and prominent grand design structure at larger radii ( within 10% of @xmath1 , as shown in figure  [ fig : gd ] ) as lgd structure ( large grand design ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : gd ] shows four examples of galaxies for which grand design structure is evident at larger scales , but is not present at smaller scales .",
    "seven galaxies ( 9% of the entire sample ) have sgd structure , while twenty ( 26% ) have lgd structure .",
    "this larger - scale gd structure extends to the center of the galaxy in only two ( 10% ) of these twenty galaxies .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : lgdvsgd ] , lgd galaxies are preferentially more strongly barred than sgd galaxies .",
    "a k - s test excluding the two shared galaxies reveals a 3% probability that sgd and lgd barstrengths are drawn from the same parent distribution .",
    "we further find a 0.4% probability that lgd galaxies have the same underlying distribution of @xmath0 as the other 59 galaxies in the sample ; galaxies with lgd nuclear spirals are more strongly barred than other galaxies .",
    "it is interesting to note that the two lgd galaxies with the smallest @xmath0 ( ngc4941 and ngc1317 ) also have an obvious nuclear bar within the grand design structure ( @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "visually , sgd galaxies seem to have less circumnuclear dust than their lgd counterparts . a k - s",
    "test comparing the @xmath52 values of the two samples supports this impression , yielding a 3% probability that the two are drawn from the same parent distribution ( see figure  [ fig : lgdvsgd ] ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the overall trend discussed below in  [ sec : rings ] that more strongly barred galaxies have dustier circumnuclear regions , suggesting that the gas and dust funnelled to the center of a barred galaxy may eventually suffice to disintegrate a symmetric two - armed spiral in the central few hundred parsecs . the most likely mechanism for erasing the small - scale spiral structure is self - gravity , and later , energy feedback from substantial star formation ( * ?",
    "* e.g. , ) .",
    "we note that many of the galaxies with the largest @xmath47 ( e.g. , ngc1808 , ngc2964 , ngc6217 and ngc7552 ) are well - known starbursts or nuclear starbursts .",
    "this indicates that there may be sufficient feedback from star formation to shape the structure of the circumnuclear ism .",
    "the material funnelled inward by the large - scale bar may not reach the central region at all , but instead form a circumnuclear starburst ring .",

    "one interesting transition case is ngc5427 , where the lgd spiral arms appear to become the incomplete starburst ring itself .",

    "of these eight galaxies , six have loosely wound circumnuclear spirals within the ring , while the other two ( ngc864 and ngc1326 ) have chaotic circumnuclear spirals .",
    "only 32 of the 75 galaxies are lw or cs ; according to a binomial distribution , the probability of randomly selecting 8 galaxies that are restricted to these two classes is 0.062% .",

    "previous observations found that grand design nuclear dust spirals are hosted exclusively by strongly barred galaxies .",

    "in fact , these two types of grand design structure are nearly disjoint : the nuclear spiral arms in only two of the twenty lgd galaxies in our sample extend into the unresolved center of the galaxy ( i.e. , also displayed sgd structure ) .",
    "the lgd spirals are found in systematically more strongly barred host galaxies .",

    "while sgd spirals are not found in galaxies with a significantly different barstrength than typical galaxies , they are found in galaxies with significantly less dust structure in the central regions than lgd galaxies .",
    "the reduced dust structure may reflect a requirement for the formation of sgd morphology , or simply a requirement for its detection .",
    "the lgd spiral arms may not maintain coherence to the nucleus because mass inflow due to the presence of a large - scale bar prompts star formation , which can disrupt a nuclear grand design spiral .",
    "in addition , forty percent of the lgd spirals do not extend into the nuclear region because there is a circumnuclear starburst ring .",
    "we find that all of the galaxies with circumnuclear starburst rings have lgd structure and are more strongly barred than other galaxies . within the rings , three fourths of the galaxies with circumnuclear rings have coherent loosely wound spirals within the ring , while the others have less coherent chaotic spirals .",

    "<S> we present a comparison of barstrength @xmath0 and circumnuclear dust morphology for 75 galaxies in order to investigate how bars affect the centers of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we trace the circumnuclear dust morphology and amount of dust structure with structure maps generated from visible - wavelength hst data , finding that tightly wound nuclear dust spirals are primarily found in weakly barred galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> while strongly barred galaxies sometimes exhibit grand design structure within the central 10% of @xmath1 , this structure rarely extends to within @xmath2  pc of the galaxy nucleus . in some galaxies , these spiral </S>",
    "<S> arms terminate at a circumnuclear starburst ring . </S>",
    "<S> galaxies with circumnuclear rings are generally more strongly barred than galaxies lacking rings . within these rings , </S>",
    "<S> the dust structure is fairly smooth and usually in the form of a loosely wound spiral . </S>",
    "<S> these data demonstrate that multiple nuclear morphologies are possible in the most strongly barred galaxies : chaotic central dust structure inconsistent with a coherent nuclear spiral , a grand design spiral that loses coherence before reaching the nucleus , or a grand design spiral that ends in a circumnuclear ring . </S>",
    "<S> these observations may indicate that not all strong bars are equally efficient at fueling material to the centers of their host galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we investigate the longstanding hypothesis that sb(s ) galaxies have weak bars and sb(r ) galaxies have strong bars , finding the opposite to be the case : namely , sb(r ) galaxies are less strongly barred and have less dust structure than sb(s ) galaxies . in general , more strongly barred galaxies tend to have higher nuclear dust contrast . </S>"
