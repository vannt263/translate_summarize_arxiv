    "quantum plasmonics is an emerging area of research which involves the study of the optical properties of hybrid photonic structures incorporating both plasmonic nanostructures and quantum emitters @xcite , such as atoms , molecules and semiconductor quantum dots .",
    "these complex hybrid are active photonic structures and expected to enhance optical response significantly , for example modification of the linear susceptibility @xcite and the enhancement of nonlinear susceptibilities in several quantum systems with different level structures coupled to various plasmonic nanostrcutures @xcite .",
    "four wave mixing is one of the above mentioned nonlinear process of light - matter interactions in which three incoming waves , indicated as @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 in the material generate a fourth wave of frequency @xmath3 @xcite . assuming that the three incident waves have frequencies in the visible or near - infrared range , the incoming electric fields @xmath4 @xmath5with @xmath6 interact with the material s electrons to induce a nonlinear polarization @xmath7 in the illuminated volume .",
    "the magnitude of the polarization is determined by the strength of the incident fields and the efficiency with which the material can be polarized @xcite .",
    "the latter is indicated with the third - order nonlinear susceptibility @xmath8 , a measure of the material s response to the incoming fields .",
    "four wave mixing ( fwm ) has found numerous practical applications , including : optical processing ; nonlinear imaging ; real - time holography and phase - conjugate optics ; phase - sensitive amplification ; and entangled photon pair production @xcite .",
    "in several recent studies , the modification of @xmath8 ( fwm process ) susceptibility in a quantum dot system coupled to spherical nanoparticle has been investigated when the hybrid structures interacts with a weak probe field and a strong pump field @xcite .",
    "all these works have shown for different distance between the quantum dot and the metal nanoparticle the @xmath8 susceptibility can be either enhanced or strongly suppressed .",
    "in addition , bistable behavior has been also reported in these kind of systems @xcite . + here ,",
    "we propose a method for increasing the efficiency of fwm processes by exploiting gold grating @xcite .",
    "narrow peaks are observed in the transmission spectra of p - polarized light passing through a thin gold film that is coated on the surface of a transparent diffraction grating .",
    "the spectral position and intensity of these peaks can be tuned over a wide range of wavelengths by simple rotation of the grating @xcite .",
    "the wavelengths where these transmission peaks are observed correspond to conditions where surface plasmon resonance occurs at the gold - air interface .",
    "light diffracted by the grating couples with surface plasmons in the metal film to satisfy the resonant condition , resulting in enhanced light transmission through the film .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe the fwm process in the coupled system of gold grating with a quantum oscillator . in the same section",
    ", we introduce the hamiltonian for hybrid system .",
    "fwm process is also included in the second quantized hamiltonian .",
    "we derive the equations of motion for the system using the density matrix formalism for the quantized quantum oscillator .",
    "we use phenomenological way to include damping of gold grating modes as well as quantum emitter . in section ii b , we demonstrated that fwm process can be suppressed for @xmath9 . in section ii c , we present a contrary effect where fmw process can be enhanced .",
    "this is due to cancellation of non resonant terms in denominator . in section iii",
    ", we further investigate the case of gold grating coupled to two quantum emitters ( both quantum emitters coupled to each other also ) simultaneously .",
    "we conclude our results in section iv .",
