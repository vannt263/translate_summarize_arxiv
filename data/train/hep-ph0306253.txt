    "weak decays of charmed mesons provide a useful testing ground for nonperturbative methods , such as qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "contrary to @xmath0 decays , in @xmath1 decays the hadronic matrix elements are multiplied by experimentally known ckm parameters : @xmath2 is extracted from charm - tagged @xmath3-decays and @xmath4 from neutrino - nucleon production of charm @xcite . therefore , the qcd sum rule predictions for the hadronic parameters of @xmath1 decays can be directly compared with experimental data .",
    "this comparison allows one to gain more confidence in the sum rule results for the @xmath0-decay hadronic matrix elements that are used to extract the poorly known ckm parameters .",
    "the outline of the qcd sum rule method and the predictions for @xmath0 decays are discussed in the context of ckm physics in @xcite ( in sect .",
    "4.2 of chapter iii and in sects .  2.1.3 , 2.1.4 of chapter",
    "iv ) , see also @xcite . here",
    "i will concentrate on the corresponding results for the charm sector .",
    "a detailed review of qcd sum rules can be found in @xcite .",
    "one of the first applications of qcd sum rules was the estimate of the charmed quark mass . according to the original method @xcite , one employs the correlator of two @xmath6 currents .",
    "due to dispersion relation , the n - th derivative of the correlator in @xmath7 ( the momentum transfer squared ) is related to the n - th power moment of the hadronic @xmath8 cross - section @xmath9 : @xmath10 the moments @xmath11 are calculated in qcd in a certain range of @xmath12 , far off - shell ( @xmath13 ) , in terms of the virtual c - quark loops , taking into account the @xmath5-quark interactions with perturbative gluons and nonperturbative gluon condensate @xcite .",
    "the results depend on @xmath14 , @xmath15 and the gluon condensate density .",
    "the hadronic cross section in eq .",
    "( [ moments ] ) is saturated by the charmonium resonances @xmath16 , and at @xmath17 by the open charm - anticharm production .    in table 1",
    "the recent results for the @xmath18 mass @xmath19 extracted from the sum rule moments ( [ moments ] ) with the @xmath20 accuracy are presented and compared with the predictions of other methods .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     having obtained a prediction for @xmath21 one is not yet able to compare it with an experimental number , because only @xmath22 is measured , the latest result @xcite being : @xmath23 importantly , qcd sum rules also predict the @xmath24 ratio in terms of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 the ratio of strange and nonstrange quark condensates .",
    "the rather old results collected in @xcite yield an interval : @xmath28 to be compared with the recent averages @xmath29 $ ] of lattice quenched [ unquenched ] qcd @xcite with a smaller uncertainty ( see also @xcite ) . multiplying the sum rule prediction from table 2 : @xmath30 mev by the ratio ( [ interv ] ) we obtain : @xmath31 in the ballpark of the experimental interval ( [ fdsexp ] ) . improving the latter and measuring",
    "@xmath21 will provide more decisive checks .",

    "decays with @xmath39 , the scalar form factor @xmath40 entering the chirally suppressed @xmath41 part of the decay distribution can also be extracted .",
    "the cabibbo enhanced @xmath42 decays provide @xmath43 form factors with an even better accuracy .",
    "heavy - to - light form factors are calculated using qcd light - cone sum rules ( lcsr ) .",
    "one of the first applications of this sum rule technique was the calculation of @xmath44 in @xcite .",
    "the updated results for @xmath44 including higher twist terms @xcite and @xmath45 corrections @xcite can be found in @xcite .",
    "the form factor @xmath46 was calculated in @xcite .",
    "the sum rules for @xmath47 are obtained by the same replacement ( [ replace ] ) .",
    "let me emphasize that this transition is done from one finite mass to the other .",
    "contrary to hqet relations between @xmath0 and @xmath1 form factors , no heavy - quark mass approximation is involved . since @xmath48 is used to extract @xmath49 from @xmath50 , a comparison of the sum rule predictions for @xmath37 form factors with experimental data will ensure more confidence in the lcsr method .",
    "the most recent lcsr result @xmath51 obtained in @xcite takes into account the twist-2 term in nlo and twist-3,4 contributions in lo ( in the expansion of the underlying vacuum - pion correlator in the pion distribution amplitudes with growing twist ) . from the same correlator ,",
    "using double dispersion relation one has access to the @xmath52 coupling @xmath53 @xcite , predicting the product @xmath54 . using the svz sum rule result for @xmath21 quoted above",
    ", the @xmath55-pole contribution to the @xmath37 form factor is calculated .",
    "the two predictions of lcsr are used @xcite to fit the @xmath37 form factor in the whole kinematical region @xmath56 to the simple ansatz @xcite inspired by dispersion relation : @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "interestingly , the sum rule results are consistent with the @xmath55-pole dominance for the form factor .",
    "the predicted integrated decay width @xmath59 is in a reasonable agreement with the experimental number @xcite @xmath60 . at the zero momentum transfer",
    "the lcsr prediction also agrees with the recent lattice result @xcite @xmath61 . on the other hand",
    ", the lattice calculation @xcite suggests that the contribution of excited @xmath55 states is not small . to assess the reliability of these theoretical predictions , one has to wait until the @xmath62 decay distribution is accurately measured .    finally , the lcsr result for @xmath43 form factor @xcite is @xmath63 at @xmath64 mev , very sensitive to the strange quark mass .",
    "the corresponding integrated width @xmath65 is in a good agreement with experiment @xcite @xmath66 .    concluding this section ,",
    "let me briefly discuss the important issue of the @xmath52 coupling ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the recent first measurement of the total width of @xmath55 by cleo collaboration @xcite : @xmath67 kev yields for this coupling @xmath68 ( using the definition of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the lcsr prediction @xcite , @xmath69 ,",
    "is obtained by dividing the calculated product @xmath70 by the two decay constants , @xmath21 and @xmath71 , extracted from 2-point svz sum rules .",
    "taking into account the estimated theoretical uncertainty , the upper limit of the lcsr prediction is @xmath72 , still 25% lower than the central value of the cleo number .",
    "meanwhile , the first lattice qcd prediction @xmath73 @xcite agrees with the cleo result .",
    "if the future measurements ( although extremely difficult ! ) and lattice calculations confirm the large value of this coupling , one has to clarify the status of the lcsr prediction .",
    "having in mind that all other sum rules discussed above use one - variable dispersion relations , one might suspect that certain complications arise in the double dispersion relation used in lcsr for the @xmath52 coupling .",
    "more specifically , the simplest quark - hadron duality ansatz ( one resonance plus continuum ) in both @xmath1 and @xmath55 channels may be too crude .",
    "one possible scenario was recently discussed in @xcite : assuming a partial cancellation between the contributions of excited and ground @xmath74 states in the dispersion relation , one gets an increase of the lcsr coupling . without going into further details ,",
    "let me only mention that the magnitude of the coupling @xmath53 and the shape of the form factor @xmath38 are closely related .",
    "suppose the form factor is dominated by the @xmath55-pole contribution : @xmath75 taking for @xmath53 the cleo central value and multiplying it with @xmath76 mev ( within the lattice qcd prediction @xcite ) one obtains a semileptonic width @xmath77 which is about two times larger than the experimental width quoted above @xcite . to make the strong coupling measured by cleo consistent with the semileptonic width",
    ", one needs a substantial negative interference between the @xmath55-pole and excited @xmath55 states in the dispersion relation for the form factor ( as also noticed in @xcite ) , resulting in a visible deviation of the @xmath62 decay distribution from the @xmath55-pole dominance .",
    "exclusive rare @xmath1 decays such as @xmath78 , etc .",
    "will become important highlights in the future high - statistics charm physics experiments .",
    "being suppressed in the standard model , these decays are promising indicators of new physics .",
    "the long - distance amplitudes of rare @xmath1 decays in the standard model still lack a qcd based analysis .",
    "i believe , qcd sum rules in both two - pont ( svz ) and light - cone versions can essentially help in solving this problem , one example is the lcsr prediction for weak radiative decays obtained in @xcite : @xmath79 where all numbers have an @xmath80 accuracy .",
    "this analysis can be further improved and extended to the other rare @xmath1 decay channels .",
