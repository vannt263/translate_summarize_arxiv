    "the far - infrared ( fir ) emission from galaxies is dominated by the thermal emission from dust grains ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is known to be a good indicator of star formation rate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the major heating source of dust grains is usually stellar radiation , the fir colour , which reflects the dust temperature , is one of the most direct indicators of the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) .",
    "moreover , the fir emission is usually optically thin in the ism , which means that we can trace all the radiation over the entire column .",
    "spatially resolved images of galaxies are required to study the dust properties in different regions of a galaxy and the characteristics of individual star - forming regions .",
    "also , since only integrated global properties are observable for distant star - forming galaxies , it is important to clarify the relation between the global and local characteristics .",
    "specifically we should distinguish whether the major dust heating comes from individual star - forming regions or general isrf ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to clarify the major origin of the dust heating source responsible for the fir emission .",
    "however , because the spatial resolution of fir observation is generally poor , only galaxies with large angular size can be well resolved .",
    "m81 is particularly suitable for our purpose because ( i ) it is a nearby big galaxy with a face - on geometry ; ( ii ) it can be compared with another well - known spiral galaxy , the milky way ; and ( iii ) it is within a field of view of the scan observation of _ akari _ , which is useful to quantify the global properties and to subtract the background .    which wavelengths in fir are necessary ? at long wavelengths ( @xmath1 ) , the dust emission is mainly contributed by relatively large grains in radiative equilibrium with the stellar radiation field . however , an emission excess in shorter wavelengths ( @xmath2 65@xmath0 ) is usually observed , which comes from very small dust grains suffering from stochastic heating , that is , heated transiently to a high temperature @xcite . in order to estimate the large grain temperature , which can be used to indicate the intensity of the ambient stellar radiation , at least two bands are needed at wavelengths @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , we require three wavelengths in the fir to make a fir colour  colour diagram .",
    "it has been shown that the fir colour  colour relation of galaxies is useful to derive the wavelength dependence of dust emissivity @xcite .",
    "the fir colour  colour relations in the galactic disc and the large / small magellanic clouds are tight , indicating that the wavelength dependence of dust fir emission can be considered to be uniform within and among those galaxies @xcite .",
    "such a common wavelength dependence of dust emission can be nicely reproduced by a common grain optical properties and size distribution @xcite . in this paper",
    ", the fir colour - colour diagram also proves to be important for investigating the dust emission characteristics .",
    "slow - scan data of far infrared surveyor ( fis ) onboard _ akari _ @xcite with the 65 , 90 , and 140 @xmath0 bands is enough for the above requirements .",
    "( we do not use the 160 @xmath0 data because the data quality is not good enough for our purpose . )",
    "the 90 and 140 @xmath0 bands are used to estimate the large grain equilibrium temperature , and a colour  colour diagram can be made with the 65 , 90 , and 140 @xmath0 bands . besides , by using the _ akari _ fis data , a direct comparison among m81 and a large number of galaxies in the _ akari _ all - sky data @xcite can be made because of the common observational facility .",
    "very recently , @xcite has reported an analysis of the _ akari _ data of m81 .",
    "they focus on the star formation law but do not investigate the details of the dust temperature distribution within the galaxy and the fir colour  colour diagram .",
    "m81 is also observed by the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _",
    "@xcite , whose 70 @xmath0 and 160 @xmath0 data can be compared with our data . however , the dust temperature from the 70 @xmath0 and 160 @xmath0 bands can overestimate the equilibrium temperature because of the possible contamination in the 70 @xmath0 emission by the stochastically heated very small grains .",
    "thus , another fir band at @xmath1 is desirable .",
    "this galaxy has recently been observed by @xcite with _ herschel space observatory _ @xcite , whose long - wavelength coverage is particularly useful to examine the robustness of our analysis against the inclusion of long - wavelength data .",
    "although the _ herschel _ data are better than our _ akari _ data both in the spatial resolution and sensitivity , we concentrate on the _ akari _ data in this paper because not only the data of m81 is available but also the all - sky survey data can be used to test if the fir colours obtained for m81 can be discussed in terms of a large number of other nearby galaxies taken by the same facility .    in this paper",
    ", we aim to point out the importance of fir mapping data by deriving some fundamental quantities about dust ( dust temperature , dust optical depth , etc . ) . at the same time",
    ", we try to clarify the relation between global ( integrated ) quantities and spatially resolved quantities .",
    "some important features in the fir colour  colour diagram of a spatially resolved image is also focused on .",
    "the method used in this paper is general and can be applied to future data taken by _",
    "herschel _ or the atacama large millimetre / submillimetre array ( alma ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we explain the data analysis in section [ sec : data ] , and describe some basic results related to global properties such as morphology and radial dependence in section [ sec : result ] .",
    "we investigate the distribution of dust temperatures and the colour  colour diagram in section [ sec : temperature ] .",
    "we discuss the results obtained for m81 in general contexts in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] gives the conclusion .",
    "the distance to m81 is assumed to be 3.63mpc @xcite throughout this paper . at this distance , 1arcmin corresponds to 1.06kpc .",
    "m81 was observed by _ akari_/fis as a pointed observation ( pi : fis team ) .",
    "the data are taken from data archives and transmission system .",
    "photometric observations were performed with four bands : _",
    "_ n__60 ( central wavelength : 65@xmath0 ) , _ wide - s _ ( 90@xmath0 ) , _ wide - l _ ( 140@xmath0 ) , and _ _ n__160 ( 160@xmath0 ) with an observational mode of fis01 ( photometry / mapping mode ) , a reset interval of 0.5s and a scan speed of 15 arcsec s@xmath3 .",
    "we utilize the images of the 65 @xmath0 , 90 @xmath0 , and 140 @xmath0 bands .",
    "the quality of the 160 @xmath0 band image is not good enough for our purpose .",
    "the fis observation of m81 is composed of two pointings : one covers almost all the m81 area except for the south - east edge , which is observed by the second observation .",
    "we combine those two images to obtain the entire m81 image after the background subtraction ( section [ subsec : bak ] ) , and the analysis procedures before combining the images are identical for the two images .",
    "the measured fwhms of point spread function are @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 @xcite , which correspond to 650 pc , 690 pc , and 1000 pc , respectively , at m81 .",
    "thus , internal structures such as spiral arms can be clearly identified on the images ( section [ subsec : morphology ] ) .",
    "the raw data were reduced by using the fis slow - scan tool ( version 20070914 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the process includes flagging of bad data , measurement of sky signal , dark and response correction , flat - fielding , and construction of co - added images .",
    "we used the local - flat for the flat - fielding .",
    "the output image grid size is chosen to be 30  , which is about half of the beam size of 140 @xmath0 .",
    "we confirmed that the following results are not sensitive to the selection of the grid size .",
    "the final image is smoothed with a length of @xmath7 for the sw ( 65 @xmath0 and 90 @xmath0 ) images and @xmath8 for the lw ( 140 @xmath0 ) image to avoid the effect of small scale detector noise .",
    "it is known that the _ akari_/fis detectors underestimate the total flux probably because of the slow response @xcite .",
    "thus , we multiply the correction factors for the intensity , 1.7 for 65@xmath0 and 90@xmath0 , and 1.9 for 140@xmath0 , are multiplied to each band . because the factors are similar to all the bands , the colours ( flux ratios ) and dust temperatures are not significantly affected by this correction .      since the intensity at the central wavelength",
    "is derived by assuming a flat spectrum ( @xmath9 ) in the fis slow - scan tool , a colour correction should be applied .",
    "we applied correction to the _ wide - s _ ( 90 @xmath0 ) and",
    "_ wide - l _ ( 140 @xmath0 ) fluxes , assuming a spectral shape of @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the dust temperature , @xmath12 is the emissivity index , and @xmath13 is the planck function . the emissivity index @xmath12 is chosen to be 2 in this paper unless otherwise stated .",
    "the value of @xmath12 is dependent on the grain composition , and @xmath14 is appropriate for astronomical silicate and graphite in @xcite .",
    "we apply @xmath15 k and 19 k for _ wide - s _ and _",
    "wide - l _ , respectively ; the former ( latter ) temperature is derived from the total fluxes of m81 at _ _ n__60 and _ wide - s _ ( _ wide - s _ and _",
    "wide - l _ ) ( see section [ subsec : global ] ) .",
    "consequently , the correction factor is 0.92 and 0.94 for the _ wide - s _ and _ wide - l _ fluxes , respectively , and the flux obtained by the slow scan tool is divided by these factors .",
    "the uncertainty caused by the colour correction ( 5 per cent for _ wide - s _ and 1 per cent for _ wide - l _ for the temperature range observed in the m81 disc ; section [ subsec : tmap ] ) is smaller than the errors caused by the background fluctuation .",
    "for the narrow band _ _ n__60 ( 65 @xmath0 ) we do not apply the correction , since the colour correction only changes the flux by less than 3 per cent .",
    "bright stripes along the scan direction caused by glitches or non - uniform detector sensitivity are observed in all the three bands . in order to eliminate these structures ,",
    "the background levels are estimated for each line along the scan direction by averaging the intensities in the two sections before and after the scan of the m81 main body with a separation of about @xmath16 and a total length of about @xmath17 , and then subtracted .",
    "the rmss of the background are 1.3 , 0.7 , 2.9 mjy sr@xmath3 for the 65 , 90 , and 140 @xmath0 bands , respectively .",
    "these values are estimated before eliminating the stripes to show the original uncertainty including the non - uniform sensitivity and the time variability of the detector response .",
    "we matched the positions of the images taken by two detectors , sw ( _ _ n__60 and _ wide - s _ ) and lw ( _",
    "wide - l _ ) according to the position of central peak of the galaxy image .",
    "the uncertainty in the relative position between the detectors is well below the grid size .",
    "the intensity ( surface brightness ) at a wavelength @xmath18 ( frequency @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the light speed ) in each grid is denoted as @xmath21 .",
    "the intensity ratio , @xmath22 , is called @xmath23 colour in this paper .",
    "we derive the dust temperature @xmath11 in each grid as follows . since the dust emission is optically thin in the fir ( section [ subsec : tmap ] ) , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the optical depth at wavelength @xmath18 .",
    "the functional form of the optical depth is assumed to be @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) with an unknown constant @xmath28 , which is independent of the frequency .",
    "this functional form for the optical depth indicates that the frequency dependence of the dust emission coefficient follows @xmath29 with @xmath14 .",
    "as a function of wavelength in section [ subsec : clr ] for a detailed theoretical model , the simple and common assumption of @xmath14 is useful to compare our observational results with the quantities obtained in the literature . ] then , with two wavelengths ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) selected , a set of equations , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , is solved to obtain @xmath11 and @xmath28 .",

    "* ) , and it is denoted as @xmath34 .    it is convenient to convert @xmath35 to a commonly used indicator of dust optical depth .",

    "now we theoretically quantify the observed colour  colour relation by adopting the calculations in @xcite , who treat the dust heating by an isrf and the dust cooling by thermal radiation to calculate the temperature distribution function using the framework developed by @xcite .",
    "the physical quantities that explain well the dust emission properties in the solar neighbourhood are adopted : the isrf sed by @xcite , the grain size distribution by @xcite , and the heat capacity of grain materials by @xcite . the emission coefficient of dust ( silicate and graphite )",

    "as shown by @xcite , a slight change in @xmath12 affects the colour  colour sequence significantly . to check the consistency with other nearby galaxies in the colour  colour diagram , adopting the same emission coefficient as adopted in @xcite is crucial here .",

    "the fraction of the latter ( i.e.  higher @xmath118 ) component is denoted as @xmath121 ; that is , the intensity is calculated by @xmath122 where @xmath123 is @xmath124 as a function of @xmath118 . the result is shown in fig .  [",

    "[ fig : clr ] , we also show the colours of some representative regions within the circles of 1-arcmin radius as shown in fig .",

    "this indicates that the isrf in the central and interarm regions are rather uniform and occupied with general isrfs with different intensities , while there is a large variation in the radiation field in the spiral arms with a spatial scale well below 1 arcmin .",
    "it is probable that small star - forming regions with strong radiation fields reside in spiral arms as seen in the h@xmath44 image ( fig .",

    "the dust temperature derived from the global sed ( section [ subsec : global ] ) is consistent with those in the interarm regions and in the smooth regions ( excluding the warm spots ) of the spiral arms .",
    "this suggests that the global fir sed is more representative of the dust heated by the general isrf rather than by the intense radiation in the star - forming regions .    that the fir emission traces the general isrf does not necessarily mean that the fir traces the smoothly distributed old stellar population rather than the newly formed stellar population .",
    "it is generally hard to distinguish these two components as pointed out by @xcite : an elaborated treatment of multi - wavelength star - formation indicators can be found in @xcite , who find that @xmath133 per cent of the fir emission on average is associated with the dust heated by stellar populations older than @xmath134 yr in their nearby star - forming galaxy sample .",
    "the dust optical depth derived observationally depends on the structures smaller than the spatial resolution . if the isrf is uniform in a grid used to derive the optical depth , the dust optical depth is reliable because of the dust temperature estimated represents the real dust temperature",
    ". however , if a grid is contaminated by small - scale warm spots such as a star - forming clouds , the temperature estimate is biased to such warm spots .",
    "because of this overestimate of dust temperature , the dust optical depth can be underestimated as pointed out in section  [ subsec : tmap ] . in other words ,",
    "the fir emission is not a good tracer of dust mass if the region focused on contains small - scale warm regions contributing significantly to the fir emission .",
    "we have shown in section [ subsec : clr ] that the contamination of warm regions can be identified by the fir colour  colour diagram . as we can clearly see in fig .",
    "[ fig : clr ] , the spiral arms ( s1 , s2 , and s3 ) , which contain small - scale star - forming regions ( see the h@xmath44 image in fig .  [",
    "fig : image ] ) , deviate from the the varying-@xmath118 sequence .",
    "the fir colours in the spiral arms are more consistent with a mixture of a general isrf with warm regions .",
    "thus , we suggest that the relatively small dust optical depth in high - temperature regions of the spiral arms is due to the overestimate of dust temperature due to the contamination of warm spots possibly associated with star - forming regions ( section [ subsec : tmap ] ) .    in the central region marked by",
    "` c ' , the fir colours are close to the point of uniform radiation field with @xmath135 .",
    "thus , the region may be roughly approximated with a single dust temperature .",
    "if this is true , the optical depth in the central region may reflect the real optical depth ; that is , the deficiency of dust optical depth in the central region with a radius of 1 arcmin ( 1.1 kpc ) may be real .",
    "the uniformity of the radiation field also implies that the heating by agn is not a dominant heating source in the central 1-kpc region at least for the dust which can be traced in the fir bands .",
    "the h i gas is also deficient in the central region @xcite .",
    "since the star formation activity in the central region is strong as seen in the h@xmath44 image , the radiation pressure or the thermal pressure may have pushed the gas and dust outwards .",
    "if we adopt 10 km s@xmath3 ( @xmath136 the sound velocity in the ionized regions ) for the typical velocity for the gas , a structure with a size of 1.1 kpc can be formed on a time - scale of @xmath134 yr . or some wave motion may be responsible for such a structure @xcite .",
    "the fir wavelengths observed by the _ akari _ fis bands ( 50180@xmath0 ) cover the intensity peak of the fir sed .",
    "this means that the intensities in the _ akari _ fis bands depends both on the wavelength and the dust temperature in a strongly nonlinear way .",
    "this strong nonlinearity is important in the behaviour in the colour  colour diagram : not only the strong dependence on @xmath118 but also the large separation of the two sequences ( i.e.varying @xmath118 and varying @xmath121 ) is due to such a nonlinearity .",
    "moreover , the three ( in fact four ) bands available for _ akari _ fis have advantage in the colour  colour analysis . _",
    "herschel _ is also suitable for the aim of mapping dust emission in galaxies . in spite of its higher spatial resolution",
    ", the warm spots associated with star - forming regions can not be resolved at the distance of m81 .",
    "thus , the only way to show the existence of such warm spots in the fir is to plot the fir colours ( section [ subsec : ccd ] ) .",
    "recently , @xcite have observed m81 with _",
    "herschel _ over a wide wavelength range of 70500 @xmath0 .",
    "the peak of the sed is at @xmath137 for @xmath138 k. thus , the _ herschel _ pacs 100@xmath0 and 160@xmath0 bands @xcite are suitable for covering the peak .",
    "the fact that similar temperatures are derived by both _",
    "akari _ and _ herschel _ ( 29 k , 20 k , 17 k for the nucleus , arm , and interarm , respectively ; @xcite ) indicates that the fir sed can be interpreted consistently from 90 @xmath0 to 500 @xmath0 with a single temperature .",
    "note that even with the _ herschel _ higher resolution data , _ akari _ data still have an advantage that an enormous number of the _ akari _ all - sky survey data are available for a comparison at the same wavelengths ( section [ subsec : clr ] ) .",
    "we have investigated the properties of fir emission in a spiral galaxy , m81 , by utilizing the _ akari _ imaging data at 65 , 90 , and 140 @xmath0 . combining the images in the two long - wavelength bands ( 90 and 140@xmath0 ) ,",
    "we have derived the dust temperature map .",
    "the dust temperature is @xmath139k in the centre and becomes lower in the outer part .",
    "the dust temperature derived from the global 90 and 140@xmath0 intensities is @xmath51 k , which reflects the dust temperatures in the interarm regions or the spiral arms excluding the bright knots , rather than those in the centre or in the bright knots .",
    "thus , the global dust temperature is more representative of the dust heated by the general isrf .",
    "we have also shown the 140 @xmath0 emission is more radially extended than the 90 @xmath0 emission , which is consistent with the radial dust temperature gradient .",
    "the dust optical depth traced by the fir emission is @xmath1402 .",
    "if these values are divided by 2 with an assumption that the stars are in the mid - plane on average , the expected extinction for the stellar light is @xmath1411 , consistent with the the extinction derived from the fir - to - uv ratio ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "we have also demonstrated that the fir colour  colour diagram is a useful tool to distinguish whether or not individual regions within a galaxy is dominated by a smooth isrf or contaminated by warm spots associated with star - forming regions . based on this `",
    "tool ' , we conclude that the bright regions in the spiral arms contain small - scale warm regions possibly hosting the h ii regions seen in the h@xmath44 map .",
    "this contamination of warm regions causes an underestimate of dust optical depth ( or dust column density ) . since even _",
    "herschel _ can not resolve individual star - forming regions , the fir colour  colour diagram continues to be a useful tool to see if the dust is predominantly heated by a general isrf or the dust heating by individual star - forming regions affects the fir emission .",
