    "understanding star formation mechanisms and their physical connection to the interstellar medium ( ism ) properties of galaxies is crucial for resolving astrophysical issues such as the physical nature of the hubble sequence , the nature and triggering of starbursts , and the interpretation of observations of the high  redshift universe .",
    "these scientific objectives constitute the core science program of the _ spitzer _ infrared nearby galaxies survey ( sings ) @xcite . since",
    "the science drivers of the project are dependent of many variables , the sings project requires a comprehensive set of data including infrared imaging and spectroscopic data , broadband imaging in the visible and near  infrared as well as uv imaging and spectrophotometry .",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "data and ancillary observations of the sings galaxies will also provide valuable tools for understanding the physics of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the formation of individual stars from the collapse of dense molecular clouds is relatively well known , e.g. the intensity of star formation is strongly correlated with the column density of gas and stars @xcite .",
    "however , the large  scale processes driving star formation are still poorly understood .",
    "for instance , the effect of gas dynamics on the regulation of star formation is somewhat unknown .",
    "since young stars are often associated with spiral arms , it is thought that protostars are formed from compressed gas along large ",
    "scale shock fronts .",
    "moreover , the star formation history varies greatly along the hubble sequence .",
    "elliptical galaxies , being gravitationally supported by velocity dispersion , have exhausted their gas reservoir and hence star ",
    "forming processes have ceased . nevertheless , some elliptical galaxies having a rotating disc are still forming stars ( e.g. ngc 2974 , @xcite ) .",
    "spiral galaxies , on the other hand , continue to form stars and are supported by rotation .",
    "understanding the effect of gas dynamics on star formation would certainly help improving our understanding of galaxy formation .",
    "indeed , a schmidt law modulated by rotation seems to better fit the data than a simple ( gas column density ) schmidt law @xcite .",
    "this paper presents the second part of an h@xmath0  kinematics survey of the sings galaxies .",
    "the 37 galaxies showing h@xmath0  emission were observed by means of fabry  perot ( fp ) interferometry .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ observations ] describes the composition of the sings sample and the hardware used for the observations .",
    "the data reduction process , using a custom idl pipeline designed for an optimal use of the data , is introduced in section [ reduction ] . in section [ gipsy ] , the details of the kinematical analysis that has been done on the sings",
    "galaxies are described .",
    "section [ results ] presents the observational results in the form of velocity fields , monochromatic maps , position ",
    "velocity diagrams , and rotation curves . in section [ discussion ] , the effect of the bar on the observed kinematics is discussed .",
    "finally , the scientific applications of the kinematical results presented in this paper are reviewed in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "the sample , as described by @xcite , is composed of 75 nearby ( @xmath1 mpc , for @xmath2 = 70 kms@xmath3mpc@xmath3 ) galaxies covering , in a three  dimensional parameter space , a wide range of physical properties :    * morphological type : associated with gas fraction , star formation rate ( sfr ) per unit mass , and bulge / disc structure ; * luminosity : associated with galaxy mass , internal velocity , and mean metallicity ; * fir / optical luminosity ratio : associated with dust temperature , dust optical depth , and inclination .",
    "in particular , there are roughly a dozen galaxies in each rc3 type ( e  s0 , sa  sab , sb ",
    "i0 ) leading to an extensive set of combinations of luminosity and fir / optical luminosity ratio .",
    "in particular , a factor of @xmath4 in infrared luminosity and @xmath5 in @xmath6 is covered by the sample .",
    "the 75 galaxies also represent a vast range of other galaxy properties such as nuclear activity , surface brightness , inclination , co / hi  ratio , spiral arm structure , bar structure , and environment .",
    "the galaxies were chosen as far as possible from the galactic plane in order to avoid galactic extinction and high density of foreground stars .    since gas fraction is correlated with morphological type @xcite , not all the 75 galaxies are h@xmath0emitters .",
    "in fact , h@xmath0  was not detected for ten galaxies ( e  s0 and irr types ) , thus kinematical information could not be extracted for those galaxies from emission lines .",
    "kinematics for 28 galaxies of the sings sample have already been published in @xcite .",
    "this paper presents the second part of the follow  up survey , namely the h@xmath0  kinematics of the remaining 37 galaxies .",
    "table [ basic_parameters ] presents the basic galaxy parameters .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     ]",
    "in this paper , the rotation curves given in appendix [ app : rc ] were obtained from the kinematical parameters derived using tilted  ring models which assume pure circular motions . even if we tried to avoid the zones obviously affected by non ",
    "circular motions , there is still considerable work needed to extract rotation curves that are truly representative of the mass distribution , and can be used for mass modeling purposes .",
    "this is especially true for barred systems , which account for about one third of the galaxies in table [ basic_parameters ] .",
    "the idea behind obtaining an accurate determination of the gravitational potential is correlated with the dark halo modeling .",
    "for instance , there has been significant debate about the shape of dark matter density profiles , especially regarding their inner slope . based on cosmological n  body simulations ( navarro et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 , hereafter collectively nfw ) , the dark matter halo profile appears to be independent of halo mass with an inner logarithmic slope equal to @xmath7 .",
    "nevertheless , recent higher resolution simulations suggest that the density profiles do not converge to a single power law at small radii . at the smallest resolved scales ( 0.5% of the virial radius ) ,",
    "profiles usually have slopes between 1 and 1.5 ( moore et al .",
    "1999 ; ghigna et al .",
    "2000 ; jing & suto 2000 ; fukushige & makino 2001 ; klypin et al . 2001 ; power et al . 2003 ; navarro et al .",
    "2004 ; diemand et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "in addition , all simulations find density profiles that are inconsistent with the isothermal profile found in observations . in the outer regions ,",
    "the determination of the dark halo slope based on mapping the outer density profile of galaxies is difficult , owing mainly to a lack of mass tracers at large radii . in the inner regions ,",
    "the unknown value of the stellar mass  to  light ratio further complicates the determination of the mass distribution .",
    "this has led to dedicated analysis on dwarf and low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies that are believed to be dark matter dominated at all radii ( de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ; verheijen 1997 ; swaters 1999 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that rotation curves of dwarf and lsb galaxies rise less steeply than predicted by numerical simulations based on the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm ( moore 1994 ; flores & primack 1994 ; de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ; mcgaugh & de blok 1998 ; de blok et al .",
    "2001a , 2001b ) .    however , a number of observational uncertainties cast doubt over these early claims .",
    "these include beam smearing for hi  rotation curves ( swaters et al .",
    "2000 ; van den bosch et al .",
    "2000 ) , high inclination angles and h@xmath0  long  slit alignment errors ( swaters et al .",
    "2003a ) , and non  circular motions close to the center of galaxies ( swaters et al .",
    "many of these uncertainties can be quantified or eliminated by measuring high  resolution two  dimensional velocity fields ( barnes et al .",
    "2004 ) . at optical wavelengths ,",
    "these can be obtained via fabry ",
    "perot interferometry ( e.g. , blais  ouellette et al . 1999 ) or integral field spectroscopy ( e.g. , andersen & bershady 2003 ; courteau et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "there are ways to extract the true kinematics that reflect the gravitational potential .",
    "one is to derive the potential directly from the 2d velocity field or the 3d data cube ( this is work in preparation ) .",
    "the other way is to derive the bar parameters using the _ spitzer _ images , compare with numerical simulations , and apply the necessary corrections for , e.g. the streaming motions induced by the bars ( see hernandez et al .",
    "2005b ; perez , fux & freeman , 2004 ) .",
    "this detailed work will be done in another paper ( hernandez et al .",
    "2007 in preparation ) , but we can illustrate what needs to be done by using three of the barred systems in our sample .",
    "the galaxy ngc 3351 , better known as messier 95 , is a sbb galaxy , member of the leo group .",
    "situated at a distance of 9.3 mpc , this starburst galaxy has a large  scale stellar bar which has a deprojected value of 47  for the semi  major axis @xcite . outside this bar ,",
    "the h@xmath0  velocity field is fairly regular and the kinematical pa and inclination found by _ _",
    "g__ipsy agree well with the photometric values .",
    "thus , the gas outside the bar is thought to be in circular orbits so that the rotation curve represents accurately the kinematics of this galaxy .",
    "the small deviations from circular motions are due to streaming along the inner ring .",
    "the h@xmath0  rotation curve shows a more or less constant velocity beginning at the end of the stellar bar with peaks corresponding to the 70  inner ring .",
    "figure [ fig : modelm95 ] displays the tilted  ring model results and one can see , outside the bar , the fairly regular values for the position angle and inclination as a function of the radius .    ) and inclination ( 41@xmath8 ) .",
    "the stellar bar ends at a radius of 47 .",
    "so , the filled circles give the values inside the bar and the empty circles the values outside the bar region.[fig : modelm95],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    however , inside the large  scale bar , the h@xmath0  velocity field shows the perturbed kinematics expected for this barred system .",
    "the twisted isovelocity contours indicate that a pure circular rotation model will present a poor fit to the data and hence kinematical information extracted in this region will be incorrect .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : modelm95 ] where the filled circles represent the values computed in the bar region .",
    "it is thus imperative to take into account the bar location when deriving kinematical parameters .",
    "furthermore , bar modeling is crucial in order to properly compute the rotation curve in this region .",
    "numerical computations were performed with ` gadget ` , a tree ",
    "body@xmath9sph code developed by springel , yoshida & white ( 2001 ) . for the needs of the simulations , an initial stellar population is set up to reproduce a disc galaxy with an already formed bulge .",
    "the initial positions and velocities of the stellar particles are drawn from a superposition of two axisymmetric miyamoto ",
    "nagai discs ( miyamoto & nagai 1975 ) of mass respectively @xmath10 and @xmath11m@xmath12 , of scale lengths respectively @xmath13 and @xmath14  kpc and common scale height of @xmath15  kpc .",
    "velocity dispersions are computed solving numerically the jeans equations .",
    "the total number of stellar particles is 1.1  @xmath16 .",
    "the run includes a dark halo made of 2.2  @xmath17 live particles distributed in a plummer sphere of scalelength @xmath18  kpc and of mass respectively 2.42 and 6.46  @xmath19m@xmath12 .",
    "the total mass of the gas is 0.11  @xmath19m@xmath12 . finally , the total mass of the simulated galaxy is 7.67  @xmath20m@xmath12 .",
    "numerical simulations of the kinematical effect of the bar are shown in figure [ fig : oh ] .",
    "the input model for the galaxy is pure rotation and the corresponding rotation velocities along the major and minor axis are shown in faint blue and green lines .",
    "afterwards , the code simulates galaxy evolution where a bar is developing .",
    "the difference in orientation between the major axis and the bar corresponds to different evolving times which are given in units of millions years . for ngc 3351 ,",
    "the kinematical pa ( @xmath21@xmath8 ) is almost perpendicular to the bar , with @xmath22@xmath8  using the value found by @xcite .",
    "the results of the simulations are shown in the form of rv maps and stellar densities superposed .",
    "for an 80@xmath8  difference between the major axis and the bar pas , the overall effect is an artificial increase in the velocity gradient .",
    "this can be explained by gas moving along x1 orbits ( parallel to the bar ) where the velocity is greater at the perigalacticon ( near the center ) than at the apogalacticon ( near the end of the bar ) .",
    "the true kinematics of this galaxy will therefore be obtained by correcting this artificial increase in the velocity gradient . until then",
    ", rotation velocities inside the bar region are not given for the final rotation curve .",

    "+     +        ) and inclination ( 52@xmath8 ) .",
    "the stellar bar ends at a radius of 35 .",
    "so , the filled circles give the values inside the bar and the empty circles the values outside the bar region.[fig : modeln337],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    another galaxy displaying a perturbed velocity field is ngc 337 .",
    "this asymmetric sbd galaxy features an off  center stellar bar having a pa of 162@xmath8  and a deprojected value of 35  for the bar semi ",
    "major axis @xcite .",
    "since the photometric major axis of this galaxy is 130@xmath8 , the bar has an intermediate orientation with respect to the major axis .",
    "numerical simulations have been done for this bar position and the results are illustrated in the middle panel of figure [ fig : oh ] .",
    "the simulated velocity field displays the characteristic z  shape of the isocontours similar to what is seen in the h@xmath0  velocity map .",
    "one characteristic is the velocity gradient along the minor axis ( green line in figure [ fig : oh ] ) .",
    "another feature is the relative agreement between the input rotation velocities ( faint blue line ) and the computed ones ( triangle symbols show averaged red and blue points calculated using the method presented in section [ gipsy ] ) .",
    "the rotation curve in the bar region is thus provided for this galaxy since these perturbations are confined to the minor axis which is excluded from the fit .",
    "the tilted  ring model for this galaxy , presented in figure [ fig : modeln337 ] , illustrates the small differences for the fitted values between the bar region ( filled circles ) and spiral arms ( open circles ) .",
    "after having completed the kinematical fitting procedure , one can look at the _ spitzer _",
    "irac 3.6@xmath23 m image in order to compare the bar location with the velocity residuals . since the eastern side is approaching and the western side is receding , the spiral arms seem to be trailing in an anti  clockwise direction .",
    "the velocity residuals from the pure circular rotation model indicate positive residuals east of the bar as well as negative residuals on the southern end of the bar , suggesting an inflow of gas towards the bar .",
    "two other barred galaxies having a bar orientation intermediate to the major axis are ngc 1566 and ngc 3627 , but their seyfert activity and warped disc respectively make difficult the kinematical analysis regarding the effects of the bar .",
    "their rotation curves are provided at the end of this paper .    ) and inclination ( 68@xmath8 ) values .",
    "the stellar bar ends at a radius of @xmath2430 .",
    "[ fig : modeln4559],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    finally , the last barred system discussed in this paper is ngc 4559 , an sabcd galaxy having a small bar roughly aligned with the major axis ( @xmath25 340@xmath8  vs @xmath26@xmath8 ) .",
    "numerical simulations have been done for a bar parallel to the major axis and are presented in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : oh ] .",
    "the small velocity gradient seen in the pv diagram and in the rotation curve is in agreement with the predicted behavior seen in the simulation .",
    "the rotation velocities are artificially lowered by the radial motions in the bar , resulting in an underestimation of the luminous mass in the central regions .",
    "it is thus vital to model the bar in order to determine the accurate mass distribution .",
    "the radial mass distribution of the gas was analyzed between the 3 time steps to verify that modifications of the inner part of the rotation curve was not an effect of migration of the gas during the run .",
    "further bar modeling enables the bar length to be calculated . using the fourier moment analysis on azimuthal profiles derived using j and k 2mass images ( see @xcite and ) , the deprojected value for the bar semi ",
    "major axis is @xmath27 .",
    "for example , the tilted  ring model for ngc 4559 shows that it is difficult to assess which radii are affected by the bar ( see figure [ fig : modeln4559 ] ) .",
    "however , the h@xmath0  velocity field displays streaming motions outside the bar as well , therefore the velocities are perturbed to at least a radius of @xmath2440 . deriving the form of the gravitational potential directly from 2d kinematics and/or using numerical simulations of the bar , are thus essential to perform in order to study properly the mass distribution and solve the dark halo density profile inconsistencies .",
    "we have presented in this paper the second and last part of the h@xmath0kinematics follow  up survey of the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey ( sings ) sample .",
    "the goal of this kinematical follow up is to better understand the role of baryons and of the dark / luminous matter relation in star forming regions of galaxies .",
    "the shape of the velocity field in the central galactic regions , drawn through its h@xmath0 component , is indeed directly related to the baryonic luminous disk and the star formation processes .",
    "the sings sample will provide a unique opportunity to link the kinematics with numerous observations and studies at other wavelengths .",
    "the data have been obtained from high resolution fabry ",
    "perot observations using the ` fantomm `  camera and a l3ccd detector .",
    "the sings sample of galaxies has been observed at the omm 1.6 m telescope , eso la silla 3.6 m telescope , cfht 3.6 m telescope , and wht 4.2 m telescope .",
    "the velocity fields were obtained by using a data reduction pipeline written in idl and the rotation curves were computed by the _",
    "task from the _ gipsy _ software .",
    "when fitting the kinematical parameters , care was taken to avoid the zones obviously affected by non ",
    "circular motions .",
    "however , we have demonstrated that for barred systems , different bar characteristics considerably modify the central velocity gradient of the computed rotation curves in the pure circular rotation hypothesis .",
    "therefore , numerical modeling of barred galaxies is crucial in order to extract rotation curves that are truly representative of the gravitational potential and hence of the mass distribution in those galaxies . in the meantime",
    ", the dark matter distribution of the sings galaxies , using the rotation curves derived here , will be presented in a forthcoming paper .    not only",
    "will these observations provide the high spatial resolution data needed for constraining the dark matter density profiles of galaxies , but they will be helpful for studying these profiles as a function of morphological type .",
    "furthermore , they will help to delineate the role of gas kinematics in regulating the star formation rate .",
    "for instance , have argued that the probability of collapse of molecular clouds leading to star formation is greatly enhanced in slowly rotating gas discs compared to high velocity rotation . moreover , and have suggested that the star forming inner and nuclear rings in the nearby galaxies ngc 3627 and ngc 628 ( respectively ) are driven by a rotating asymmetry because their location in the host disk are in agreement with lindblad resonances caused by a bar pattern speed .",
    "gas dynamical processes therefore are important in regulating the star formation history of galaxies and the h@xmath0  kinematics presented in this paper will help understanding the star formation processes .",
    "we would like to thank jacques boulesteix , jean  luc gach , philippe balard and olivier boissin for helping with the instrumentation and part of the observations and the staff of the four observatories , where the data were obtained , for their continuing support .",
    "the william herschel telescope is operated on the island of la palma by the isaac newton group in the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofisica de canarias .",
    "we acknowledge support from the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada and the fonds qubcois de la recherche sur la nature et les technologies .",
