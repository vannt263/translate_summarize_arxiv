    "spontaneous symmetry breaking in the standard model leads to one remnant scalar particle , the higgs boson  @xcite .",
    "a light higgs boson is expected to be produced at an @xmath1 collider of a few hundred@xmath2 via the higgs - strahlung process , @xmath3 .",
    "however , if a particle produced in association with the z is detected , the confirmation of its scalar nature will be essential to its identification with the higgs boson .",
    "here we study the production of a standard model higgs boson with a mass @xmath4 near the kinematic threshold and compare the cross section to predictions for bosons of spin 0 , 1 and 2 produced in association with the z  @xcite .",
    "the study is performed for a linear collider operated at a centre - of - mass energies of 215 , 222 and 240@xmath2 .",
    "the simulated data statistics corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 20 fb@xmath0 at each energy point .",
    "the detector used in the simulation follows the proposal presented in the tesla technical design report @xcite .",
    "the simulation of the detector is done using simdet @xcite .",
    "events of the signal , @xmath3 , are generated using pythia @xcite .",
    "only z decays into electrons and muons are considered . for the higgs boson",
    "all decay modes are simulated as expected in the standard model .",
    "the values of the cross section in the standard model and the expected numbers of events corresponding to a luminosity of 20 fb@xmath0 are given in table  [ table : hevents ] at centre - of - mass energies of 215 , 222 and 240@xmath2 .",
    ".the cross sections and numbers of events expected in the standard model for the production of a higgs boson of @xmath5 = 120@xmath2 at centre - of - mass energies of 215 , 222 and 240@xmath2 and a luminosity of 20 fb@xmath0 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the following background processes are considered : @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "initial state bremsstrahlung is simulated by pythia .",
    "beamstrahlung is taken into account using the circe program  @xcite .",
    "the cross section determination is based on the @xmath10 final state , where @xmath11 is an electron or muon .",
    "the signature is two isolated energetic electrons or muons and two jets .",
    "the identification of electrons and muons and the formation of jets are performed as described in reference  @xcite .",
    "the selection efficiencies for the processes @xmath3 @xmath12 2-jet and @xmath3 @xmath132-jet are about 50% .",
    "each event is subject of a kinematic fit imposing energy and momentum conservation  @xcite .",
    "the distributions of the two jet invariant mass are shown in figure  [ 4cmass215 ] for centre - of - mass energies of 215 , 222 and 240@xmath2 .",
    "the dijet mass spectra are fitted with the superposition of signal and background distributions .",
    "the signal is parametrised with a gaussian and the background is fixed to the monte carlo expectation .",
    "the cross sections obtained for the process @xmath10 at centre - of - mass energies of 215 , 222 and 240@xmath2 are shown in figure  [ csvssqs ] .",
    "the results of fits using the predictions from models with s=0 , 1 and 2  @xcite with the normalisation as free parameter are also shown .    the s=0 case is clearly distinguished from the s=1 and 2 cases .",
    "the fit with the s=0 prediction has a good @xmath14 probability and its normalisation factor equals to unity .",
    "the other fits have a @xmath14 probability of less than 10@xmath15 .",
    "the study of the higgs boson production just above the kinematic threshold shows that the measurement of the cross section at three centre - of - mass energy points using a luminosity of 20 fb@xmath0 allows confirmation of the scalar nature of the higgs boson .",
    "bosons with other spins can be disfavoured .",
