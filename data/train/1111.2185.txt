    "the galactic evolution of sulfur ( one of the @xmath6-group elements ) has been a matter of controversy , since different [ s / fe ] behaviors with a decrease of [ fe / h ] were suggested in the regime of metal - poor halo stars depending on the lines used ; i.e. , ever - increasing [ s / fe ] even up to @xmath5 ( s  i 86934 lines of multiplet 6 ) or nearly constant [ s / fe ] at a mildly supersolar value around @xmath4  + 0.3 ( s  i 9212/9228/9237 lines of multiplet 1 ) .",

    "( 2005 ) and the references therein for more details .",
    "given this situation , we recently carried out a systematic study on the [ s / fe ] ratios of 33 disk / halo stars over a wide range of metallicity ( @xmath7  [ fe / h ]  @xmath8 ) while newly exploiting the s  i triplet lines at 1045510459  @xmath1 ( multiplet 3 ) based on the near - ir spectra obtained with subaru ircs+ao188 , which had barely been used before ( takeda & takada - hidai 2011 ; hereinafter referred to as paper i ) . rather unexpectedly , while the the local plateau of [ s / fe ]  @xmath4  + 0.20.4 ( flat trend ) was confirmed at @xmath9  [ fe / h ]  @xmath10 in consistent with the tendency already established from the s  i 9212/9228/9237 lines ( e.g. , nissen et al .",
    "2007 ) , we found a considerably large [ s / fe ] ratio amounting to @xmath4  + 0.70.8  dex at very low metallicity ( [ fe / h ]  @xmath0 ) , which apparently makes a puzzling discontinuity in the narrow interval of @xmath11  [ fe / h ]  @xmath12 .",
    "if this trend is real , the chemical evolution of sulfur would have to be considered differently from other @xmath6 elements generally showing a plateau at a mildly supersolar [ @xmath6/fe ] over the halo metallicity range .",
    "soon after we published paper i , however , spite et al .",
    "( 2011 ) reported new results of their extensive study on the [ s / fe ] of extremely metal - poor stars , which are markedly against our conclusion ( i.e. , considerably high [ s / fe ] at [ fe / h ] @xmath0 ) .",
    "that is , using the s  i 9212/9228/9237 lines based on the vlt / uves data , they showed that [ s / fe ] ratio is almost constant at mildly supersolar values of @xmath4  0.20.5 over the very metal - poor regime of @xmath13  [ fe / h ]  @xmath12 .",
    "[ fe / h ]  @xmath10 with the s  i 1045510459 triplet ( which we used in paper i ) and the forbidden [ s  i ] line at 10821  @xmath1 based on the vlt / crires data .",
    "they then concluded that [ s / fe ] favors a flat trend at @xmath4 + 0.4 and a high [ s / fe ] ( i.e. , rise or scatter at low [ fe / h ] ) is rather unlikely .",
    "however , since the [ fe / h ] range they studied is limited to between @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( where we also derived a near - plateau [ s / fe ] ) , their finding does not contradict the conclusion of paper i. ] how should we interpret this discordance ?",
    "do multiplet 1 lines ( @xmath16  @xmath17 m ) and multiplet 3 lines ( @xmath18  @xmath17 m ) yield different s abundances at the extremely low - metallicity regime ?    yet , we need to ascertain in the first place that the trend of high [ s / fe ] at [ fe / h ]  @xmath0 we obtained in paper i from the s  i 1045510459 lines universally exists for extremely metal - poor stars in general , since that conclusion was extracted from only a few objects based on the spectra of not - so - sufficient quality .",
    "we thus decided to reinvestigate the [ s / fe ] behavior for a larger sample ( ca . a dozen objects ) specifically confined to _ very _ metal poor stars ( @xmath2  [ fe / h ]  @xmath3 ) based on our new observations lately conducted again with subaru ircs+ao188 .",
    "the purpose of this article is to report the outcome of this new analysis .",
    "the near - ir spectroscopic observations were conducted on 2011 august 17 and 18 ( ut ) by using ircs+ao188 of the subaru telescope for the selected 13 very metal - poor stars , among which 4 are turn - off dwarfs and 9 are evolved giants . in addition , we also observed vesta in order to get the sun - light reference spectrum with the same equipment .",
    "the list of the targets is given in table 1 .",
    "note that g  64 - 37 ( which was studied in paper i ) was again included in the present sample .",
    "the details of the instrument and its setting along with the data reduction procedures ( the same as in our previous observations in 2009 july ) are described in section 2 of paper i.    in this observing run , a special attention was paid to achieve a sufficiently high signal - to - noise ratio so as to detect very weak s  i 1045510459 lines of extremely metal - poor stars . for this purpose ,",
    "especially long integrated exposure times ( @xmath4  14  hours ) were expended to the comparatively faint ( @xmath19  911  mag ) lowest metallicity stars ( [ fe / h ]  @xmath0 ) , such as cs  30323 - 048 , hd  126587 , g  206 - 34 , g  64 - 37 , he  1523 - 0901 , and bd@xmath2016  251 . for the other brighter objects of @xmath19  58 mag",

    "the s / n ratios , eventually accomplished in the neighborhood of the s  i lines in our finally resulting @xmath22-band spectra ( with the resolving power of @xmath23 ) , are typically @xmath4  300500 ( cf . table 1 ) .",

    "since we modeled the observed stellar line profile ( @xmath27 ) by the convolution of ( i ) the intrinsic spectrum ( @xmath28 ; where only the elemental abundance @xmath29 is allowed to vary since the model atmosphere and the microturbulence are given ) and ( ii ) the gaussian macro - broadening function @xmath30 [ @xmath31 parametrized by @xmath32 ( including the combined effects of the instrumental broadening , the macroturbulence , and the projected rotational velocity ) , such as @xmath33 , adjustable free parameters in accomplishing the best fit are @xmath29 and @xmath32 , both of which were actually varied in the previous analysis of paper i. however , for the reason mentioned in the next section , we intentionally _ fixed _ the @xmath32 parameter in this s  i 1045510459 fitting for five extremely metal - poor stars ( cs  30323 - 048 , hd  126587 , g  206 - 34 , g  64 - 37 , he  1523 - 0901 , and bd@xmath2016  251 ) at the pre - determined values which had been established in advance from the analysis applied to the strong c+si feature at @xmath34  @xmath17 m [ where @xmath29(c ) , @xmath29(si ) , and @xmath32 were varied to search for the best fit ] .",

    "interestingly , since the signs of the abundance corrections are opposite ( e.g. , @xmath49  dex for @xmath50  k , @xmath51  dex for @xmath52  dex , for g  64 - 37 ; cf .",
    "electronic table  e2 in paper i ) , the net effect on @xmath29(s ) itself is only of @xmath53  dex level and thus not so significant even in such extreme cases .",
    "this means , however , that [ s / fe ] would be appreciably raised because of the lowered [ fe / h ] , which eventually makes a serious discordance in comparison with the [ s / fe ] results of other giants stars .",
    "] we also derived @xmath54 ( equivalent width inversely computed from @xmath35 ) along with the corresponding non - lte correction ( @xmath55 ; negative values with typical extents of @xmath4  0.10.3  dex ) for the strongest component ( at 10455.45  @xmath1 ) of the triplet in the same manner as described in subsection 4.2 of paper i , which are given in table 1 and shown in figures 2b and 2c , respectively .",
    "the error bars ( a few m@xmath1 ) accompanied with @xmath54 in figure 2c are the s / n - dependent uncertainties ( @xmath56 ) estimated by cayrel s ( 1988 ) formula , @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the typical line fwhm ( @xmath4  0.51  @xmath1 ; assumed to be 0.75  @xmath1 ) , @xmath59 is the pixel size ( 0.25  @xmath1 ) , and @xmath60 is the photon - statistics accuracy ( @xmath4  ( s / n)@xmath43 ) .",
    "the abundance errors ( @xmath61 ) in response to these uncertainties in @xmath54 are further displayed in figure 2d , where we can see that these errors become considerable ( e.g. , a few tenths dex ) for extremely metal - deficient stars ( [ fe / h ]  @xmath62 ) showing very weak lines ( @xmath6356  m@xmath1 ) .",
    "we are now ready to answer the question which motivated this study : `` how do the [ s / fe ] ratios of very metal - poor stars behave around [ fe / h ]  @xmath0 : a sudden jump to a considerably high value of @xmath5 ( as suggested in paper i ) or only a mildly supersolar value at @xmath64 maintaining a flat trend ( as derived by spite et al .",
    "'' we can recognize in figure 2a that the [ s / fe ] ratios do not show any appreciable increase with a decrease in the metallicity , which are almost constant over @xmath2  [ fe / h ]  @xmath3 with the mean of @xmath65[s / fe]@xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) irrespective of dwarfs and giants .",
    "these [ s / fe ] values of very metal - deficient stars resulting from this study are combined with those of halo / disk stars derived in paper i on the [ s / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] plot displayed in figure 3 , from which we can state that [ s / fe ] ratios are almost `` flat '' around @xmath68 over the wide metallicity range between [ fe / h ]  @xmath69 and @xmath0 .",
    "thus , we have to admit that spite et al.s ( 2011 ) argument actually represented the truth , which ( in turn ) means that our previous conclusion of paper i was not correct , as far as the run of [ s / fe ] around the regime of [ fe / h ]  @xmath0 is concerned . from an impartial point of view , however , this is a gratifying consequence in a sense , because the different abundance indicators ( s  i 9212/9228/9237 and s  i 1045510459 ) eventually turned out to yield consistent results with each other .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)fig3.eps    then , how should we interpret the prominently high [ s / fe ] results once obtained for all three most metal - poor stars around [ fe / h ]  @xmath0 among the sample in paper i ; i.e. , ( [ s / fe ] , [ fe / h ] ) = ( + 0.69 , @xmath48 ) [ g  64 - 37 ] , ( + 0.76 , @xmath70 ) [ bd@xmath2018  5550 ] , and ( + 0.66 , @xmath71 ) [ hd  115444 ] ? with an intention to confirm whether or not these results are really reliable , we reexamined the process of the previous analysis for these stars .",
    "regarding bd@xmath2018  5550 and hd  115444 , we noticed that the solutions of @xmath32 ( macrobroadening parameter ; cf .",
    "section 3 ) resulting as by - products of spectrum fitting are unusually high ( 18.6 and 19.4  km  s@xmath43 , respectively ) compared to other stars where values around @xmath72  km  s@xmath43 are in common . including three kinds of macrobroadening [ instrumental profile broadening ( @xmath73 ) , macroturbulence broadening ( @xmath74 ) , and rotational broadening ( @xmath75 ) ] based on a simple modeling , where all three broadening functions are assumed to be gaussian and each of these parameters are the corresponding @xmath76-folding width , between which the following relation holds : @xmath77 . under this approximation ,",
    "@xmath73 is evaluated as @xmath78  km  s@xmath43 ( @xmath79  km  s@xmath43 for @xmath80 ) .",
    "then , we may expect that @xmath74 would be as small as @xmath81  km  s@xmath43 according to the relation @xmath82 ( cf .",
    "footnote 12 of takeda et al . 2008 ) since the typical @xmath83 ( radial - tangential macroturbulence ) is @xmath84  km  s@xmath43 for early g dwarfs and early - k giants ( cf .",

    "footnote 12 of takeda et al . 2008 ) is of minor importance ( e.g. , presumably no larger than @xmath4  23  km  s@xmath43 in most cases ) , since the stellar rotation must have been spun down in these old halo stars .",
    "accordingly , @xmath32 is reasonably expected to be around @xmath72  km  s@xmath43 , because it is primarily determined by the contribution from @xmath73 .",
    "] however , additional spectrum fitting analyses to the c+si feature at @xmath86  @xmath17 m carried out for these stars yielded quite reasonable @xmath32 values of 9.4  km  s@xmath43 ( bd@xmath2018  5550 ) and 10.2  km  s@xmath43 ( hd  115444 ) ( cf .",
    "figures 4a and 4c ) . since almost the same @xmath32 should ( in principle ) result from different lines",
    ", we can not help considering that the @xmath32 values for these two stars obtained from the s  i 1045510459 fitting in paper i were inadequately overestimated , which we suspect may presumably related to the profile - fitting technique we adopted .",
    "that is , the automatic solution - search algorithm ( takeda 1995 ) , which simultaneously varies several parameters to accomplish the best fit , is very efficient in case where the stellar line profiles are well defined .",
    "however , we should be careful when it is applied to the very weak - line case where noises are comparable to the signal of stellar lines , since it may yield physically meaningless solutions where profiles are appreciably damaged by noises . in such cases , @xmath32 had better be fixed at a ( more reliable ) value derived from other stronger lines ( such as the c+si feature ) , instead of varying both @xmath29(s ) and @xmath32 , which is the approach we adopted for the five most metal - poor stars in this study ( cf .",
    "section 3).(s ) and @xmath32 were varied to determine as in paper i. however , we checked for each star that the resulting @xmath32(s ) ( cf .",
    "table 1 ) is not in serious disagreement with @xmath32 ( c+si ) .",
    "note that hd  195636 is a rather unusual star , since its @xmath32 ( 17.0  km  s@xmath43 ) is appreciably large ( an alternative c+si fitting also yielded a similar result ) , which might have a comparatively high @xmath87 for stars of this class .",
    "] accordingly , we redetermined the s abundances from the s  i 10455 - 10459 lines while _ fixing _ the @xmath32 values at the values derived from the c+si feature , and obtained @xmath29(s ) values ( 4.67 and 4.83 ) , which are appreciably lower than the results in paper i ( 4.90 and 5.15 ) by 0.23  dex and 0.32  dex for bd@xmath2018  5550 and hd  115444 , respectively ( cf . figures 4b and 4d ) .",
    "we thus consider that the [ s / fe ] values of these two stars reported in paper i should be revised downward by these amounts , which eventually makes + 0.53 ( bd@xmath2018  5550 ) and + 0.34 ( hd  115444 ) ; i.e. , being almost within the [ s / fe ] range concluded in this study .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)fig4.eps    the star g  64 - 37 was actually an object of special attention , since the s abundance ( based on s  i 1045510459 ) derived in paper i turned out appreciably higher ( by @xmath4  0.6  dex ) than nissen et al.s ( 2007 ) result ( based on s  i 9212/9228/9237 ) only for this extremely metal - poor star , despite that a good agreement is seen for other comparatively more metal - rich stars ; this fact motivated us to include this star again in our target list . unlike the case of bd@xmath2018  5550 and hd  115444 , a serious mismatch of @xmath32 was not found in the analysis of paper i. instead , we consider that the essential problem was the comparatively poor s / n ratio ( @xmath88 ) of the spectrum used in paper i , which is evidently insufficient for a reliable abundance determination from very weak lines with depression on the order of @xmath89% .",
    "the observed and the fitted spectrum in paper i and those in this study are compared in figure 5 .",
    "we can see from this figure that the previous analysis was severely influenced by the large noise , while the situation has been improved in present case ( s / n  @xmath90 ) , resulting in an appreciable difference of solution between the two cases .",
    "we naturally consider the present result of @xmath29(s)@xmath91 ( [ s / fe ] = + 0.42 ) is more credible than that in paper i , requiring a downward revision of the previous [ s / fe ] value ( + 0.69 ) by @xmath92  dex , by which the disagreement with nissen et al .",
    "( 2007 ) has been reasonably mitigated by this amount .",
    "this study was motivated by the recent extensive work done by spite et al .",
    "( 2011 ) who reported that [ s / fe ] ratios of very metal - poor stars determined from the s  i 9212/9228/9237 lines show a nearly flat behavior at a mildly supersolar level of @xmath4  + 0.20.5 over a wide metallicity range of @xmath13  [ fe / h ]  @xmath93 , which markedly contradict the conclusion of our previous study based on s  i 10455 - 10459 lines ( paper i ) that such a flat tendency of [ s / fe ] ( persisting down to [ fe / h ]  @xmath14 ) is followed by a sudden jump up to + 0.70.8 around [ fe / h ]  @xmath0 .    with an intention to resolve the cause of this discrepancy , we rechallenged the task of clarifying the [ s / fe ] ratios at the extremely low metallicity regime down to [ fe / h ]  @xmath0 by using the same triplet lines as used in paper i , based on the new observational data for an extended sample of 13 very metal - poor stars observed with ircs+ao188 of the subaru telescope .    in almost the same manner as in paper",
    "i , we conducted a non - lte spectrum fitting analysis of s  i 1045510459 triplet , and found that the resulting [ s / fe ] values were moderately supersolar uniformly scattering around @xmath4  + 0.30.4 [ with the mean abundance of @xmath65[s / fe]@xmath94  =  + 0.34 ( @xmath67 ) ] over @xmath2  [ fe / h ]  @xmath3 without any systematic [ fe / h]-dependence , which confirmed the consequence corroborated by spite et al .",
    "( 2011 ) based on the s  i 9212/9228/9237 lines .    given these new observational facts , we reexamined the process of our previous analysis for the three extremely metal - poor stars ( g  64 - 37 , bd@xmath2018  5550 , and hd  115444 ) , for which we derived prominently high [ s / fe ] values ( @xmath4  + 0.70.8 ) that eventually lead to the conclusion of paper i. regarding g64 - 37 , our reanalysis using a new spectrum of higher quality yielded a result lower than the previous value by @xmath95  dex . for bd@xmath2018  5550 and",
    "hd  115444 , we noticed that our automatic profile - fitting method ( which varies both the abundance and the broadening parameter to find the best fit ) resulted in unreasonably large solutions of the broadening width , because of the considerable weakness of the line profile severely damaged by noises .",
    "when the broadening parameter was fixed at the more reasonable values determined from stronger lines , we found that the revised solution of the s abundance is lowered by @xmath4  0.30.4  dex for both of these stars .",
    "consequently , it is likely that we had overestimated the [ s / fe ] values of these three stars in paper i by @xmath4  0.30.4  dex .",
    "accordingly , we now consider that the flat trend of [ s / fe ] ( without any systematic rise with a decrease of metallicity ) represents the truth , at least with regard to the overall [ s / fe ] behavior of very metal - poor stars in general , which means the withdrawal of our previous argument that [ s / fe ] experiences a sudden jump up to conspicuously large [ s / fe ] of @xmath5 as the metallicity is lowered down to the [ fe / h ]  @xmath0 regime .",
    "we finally remark , however , that the existence of some stars deviating from the main trend with appreciably higher / lower [ s / fe ] amounting to [ s / fe ]  @xmath4  + 0.7/0.0 as a result of the natural diversity is not necessarily be excluded ( e.g. , we derived [ s / fe ]  =  + 0.66 for hd  126587 and [ s / fe ]  =  @xmath96 for hd  13979 ) .",
    "actually , since our 13 stars ( at [ fe / h ]  @xmath93 ) yielded @xmath65[s / fe]@xmath66 with @xmath97 ( standard deviation ) of 0.16 , we may expect the probability of finding @xmath98 deviation ( [ s / fe ]  @xmath99 or [ s / fe ]  @xmath100 ) and @xmath101 deviation ( [ s / fe ]  @xmath102 or [ s / fe ]  @xmath103 ) to be @xmath104% and @xmath84% , respectively .. we note that the @xmath97([s / fe ] ) of [ fe / h ]  @xmath105 stars derived by other investigators are somewhat smaller than our result ; e.g. , @xmath106 ( nissen et al . 2007 ) , @xmath107 ( spite et al . 2011 ) , @xmath108 ( jnsson et al . 2011 ) .",
    "it should thus be important to quantitatively establish not only the trend of [ s / fe ] on the average but also the extent of its dispersion based on a large sample of very metal - poor stars .",
