    ".    _ relation to dmrg with targeting_. the main difference between the dmrg with targeting ( dmrgt ) and the vnrg is that the former optimizes the set of states by moving the external bond along the chain whereas in the latter the external bond is fixed to a chosen site . in the dmrgt ,",
    "the energies ( and thus our cost function ) do not monotonically decrease when moving the bond along the chain but there exists a site in the chain where the energies are minimal .",
    "typically , in models with translation invariance such as the ising model or the heisenberg model , the highest accuracy is reached when at the center of the chain . in impurity models with falling hopping terms , however , the optimal site to put the external leg is ( for long chains ) the end of the chain - in which case the cheaper variant ( scaling as @xmath133 ) of the vnrg is preferable .",
    "we have described the cheaper variant of the vnrg in the manuscript but we have skipped the more expensive one where the external leg is associated with some inner site .",
    "in fact , to reduce computational complexity , we do not actually associate the external leg to a site but rather introduce an additional 3-dim tensor on the bond connecting two sites : the third leg ( the external one , similarly to the `` physical '' leg in the matrix product state ) plays the role of the external leg .",
    "this way , the optimization of the more expensive variant of the vnrg is as follows .",
    "all tensors associated to physical sites are optimized as in the cheaper vnrg , that is minimizing the cost function  ( [ eq : cost ] ) under a unitary constraint .",
    "this in total costs @xmath134 for one sweep along the chain .",
    "the additional tensor which selects the eigenstates is optimized in the same way as all tensors in the dmrg with targeting .",

    "we observe that the accuracy of the approximate eigenstates is always improved by the variational method proposed in the manuscript .",

    ", one would have to merge contributions from all nrg patches ( i.e. for all system sizes ) which is beyond the scope of this manuscript .",
    "we instead only calculate the ten largest matrix elements mentioned before and compare the accuracy before and after the variational optimization and show the results in table  [ fig : table1 ] .",
    "we observe that by the variational optimization we gain roughly one digit of accuracy in the matrix elements .        as seen from the matrix elements , the only states that contribute to the green functions are those which have one particles less or more than the ground state , that is the states which live in the subsectors @xmath183 and @xmath184 , respectively",
    ". we may therefore restrict the optimization to only these two sector which enhances the accuracy and reduces the computational costs .",

    "<S> as mentioned in the introduction , the nrg works best for strong scale separation , i.e. @xmath69 which however take one further away from the continuum limit @xmath70 and yield lower resolution at higher frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> contrarily , the dmrg does not rely on energy scale separation and thus quickly falling hopping terms but is numerically more costly , scaling as @xmath2 ( here @xmath71 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests a great potential in optimizing the _ existing _ nrg set of states using the variational method proposed in this letter where the costs only scale as @xmath1 , as in the nrg , but , like in the dmrg , no scale separation is required . </S>",
    "<S> let us first consider the exactly solvable non - interacting siam hamiltonian with @xmath72 with a discretization parameter @xmath73 .    ) on @xmath74 sites ( @xmath75 ) for nrg , dmrg , and the variational nrg , for @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> we have set @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we observe from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : nisiam ] that for a fixed bond dimension of a nrg - mps , the accuracy of eigenstates obtained by the dmrg and the variational optimization ( vnrg ) is several orders of magnitude better than the nrg results . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively the same results are obtained for the absolute errors of energies ( see supplementary material ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we now consider the interacting siam hamiltonian  ( [ eq : siam ] ) with @xmath80 on @xmath81 sites where , unlike the non - interacting case , we employ the symmetries ( total particle number of either spin ) . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the improvement of the first one thousand nrg states after variational optimization ( fig .  [ fig : siam ] ) in the regime where nrg already produces accurate results due to scale separation ( @xmath82 ) . due to the symmetries </S>",
    "<S> , the bond dimension @xmath83 ( which determines the computational complexity ) now refers to the maximal number of states in individual subsectors whereas the total number of kept states is denoted by @xmath84 .     </S>",
    "<S> states for the interacting siam chain  ( [ eq : siam ] ) on @xmath81 sites ( @xmath85 ) , for nrg and the variational nrg _ with symmetries_. sub - sector bond dimensions are taken @xmath86 , truncated to @xmath87 states of lowest energy . </S>",
    "<S> we have set @xmath82 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 . ]    as shown on fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : siam ] , the accuracy of eigenstates is greatly enhanced by the optimization . while the cost of an optimization step is comparable to the cost of a nrg step , a smaller bond dimension is needed to represent states using the vnrg as compared to the nrg . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is more pronounced for small values of @xmath91 while for larger values of @xmath91 the nrg already gives highly accurate results , only requiring little improvement . </S>",
    "<S> the results are consistent also for the fidelity of excited states and the absolute errors of energies ( see supplementary material ) . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that the logarithmic discretization is not needed for the variational scheme proposed in this letter .    _ conclusion . </S>",
    "<S> _ we have proposed a variational method to simulate or optimize the effective low energy description of one dimensional quantum systems , introducing a feedback mechanism to the nrg and identifying the cost function . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we have expressed the dmrg method with targeting as a nrg method with a moveable external index enumerating states and shown that the dmrg results can be further improved by the variational optimization . </S>",
    "<S> we have tested the methods on the quantum ising chain in a tilted magnetic field and the single impurity anderson model where we observed significant improvement of the approximate low energy eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed technique can be directly applied to optimize existing nrg results @xcite and could be a beneficial improvement of impurity solvers in the context of dynamical mean - field theory , see e.g.  @xcite .    _ acknowledgments . </S>",
