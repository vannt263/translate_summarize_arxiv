    "this paper generalizes the discrete memoryless channel ( dmc ) coding theorem for multiple codebooks of @xcite .",
    "similar models have been analyzed recently in the context of random access communication , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( typically for multiple access scenarios , not entered here ) , and unequal error protection @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the sender has a codebook library consisting of several codebooks .",
    "each codebook consists of codewords of the same length and type . as a new feature compared to @xcite , here not only the type but also the length of the codewords may vary across codebooks , thus a model in between fixed length and variable length coding is addressed .",
    "the sender uses the codebooks alternately , in any order he chooses .",
    "the receiver is not aware of the codebook choices of the sender .",
    "the different codeword lengths cause a certain asynchronism at the receiver , who should also estimate the boundaries of the codewords and avoid error propagation . a maximal mutual information based universal decoder is proposed to meet these challenges .",
    "the main theorem shows that simultaneously for each codebook , the same error exponent can be achieved as the random coding error exponent for this codebook alone provided that it does not exceed the rate of this codebook .",
    "the method of types , more exactly the subtypes technique of @xcite is used along with second order types ( see @xcite for a detailed explanation ) .    in a related work @xcite",
    "the problem of transmitting a discrete memoryless source over a dmc with variable - length codes is analyzed . using random coding argument along with maximum likelihood decoder @xcite",
    "shows that variable - length source - channel codes achieve an error exponent equal to the random coding exponent of the channel evaluated at the source entropy .",
    "a channel coding problem as in this work is not explicitly discussed in @xcite .    in this paper , to keep the discussion simple , all codeword length ratios are assumed to be in @xmath0 . this assumption could be relaxed replacing @xmath1 by an arbitrary constant , then our main theorem could be used to give an alternative proof of this result of @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this approach would be the universality of the decoder . due to the length - constraint ,",
