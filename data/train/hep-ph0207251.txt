    "we will explain admissible boundary conditions in more detail in section [ properties ] .",
    "after that it will be clear that besides ( [ bdcond ] ) the only other exponentially decaying boundary condition that is symmetric with respect to the imaginary axis is that @xmath16 is even and @xmath63 decays to zero as @xmath67 along the both ends of the imaginary axis .",
    "but if @xmath63 is an eigenfunction of @xmath68 satisfying this `` exceptional '' boundary condition , then @xmath69 is an eigenfunction of the hermitian equation @xmath70 so @xmath71 .",

    "let @xmath90 where we choose @xmath91",
    ". for @xmath92 we call the open sectors @xmath93 the _ stokes sectors _ of ( [ rossi ] )",
    ". also we call the rays @xmath94 the _ critical rays .",
    "_    in particular , the stokes sectors of ( [ rotated ] ) are @xmath95 see figure [ f : graph1 ] .     of ( [ rotated ] ) with @xmath96 .",
    "the dashed rays are the critical rays : @xmath97    now we are ready to introduce some asymptotic behavior of solutions of ( [ rotated ] ) .",
    "[ gen_pro ] let @xmath72 be a non - constant solution of ( [ rotated ] ) ( with no boundary conditions imposed ) . then the following hold .    1 .   in each stokes sector @xmath98 ,",
    "the solution @xmath72 is asymptotic to @xmath99 , \\quad\\text{as $ z \\rightarrow \\infty$ in every closed subsector of $ s_j$.}\\ ] ] 2 .",
    "if @xmath72 decays to zero in @xmath98 , for some @xmath92 , then it must blow up in @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "( however , it is possible for @xmath72 to blow up in many adjacent stokes sectors . )",
    "moreover , the asymptotic expression ( [ asymp - formula ] ) is valid with the same constant for the three consecutive stokes sectors @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the closure of @xmath98 .",
    "3 .   for each stokes sector @xmath98",
    ", there exists a solution of ( [ rotated ] ) that decays in @xmath98 , and there exists a solution of ( [ rotated ] ) that blows up in @xmath98 . and",
    "any solution of ( [ rotated ] ) can be expressed as a linear combination of these two solutions .    in lemma [ gen_pro ] , we state some asymptotic behavior of solutions of ( [ rotated ] ) .",
    "we mention that hille @xcite studied more general equations of the form ( [ rossi ] ) . in the general case ,",
    "the corresponding stokes sectors are given by ( [ gen_stokes ] ) . with these stokes sectors , lemma [ gen_pro ] ( ii ) holds though the asymptotic expression ( [ asymp - formula ] ) becomes more complicated due to more complicated potentials .",
    "also , one can see that lemma [ gen_pro ] ( iii ) implies proposition [ main2 ] ( ii ) .",
    "more precisely , if eigenvalues were not simple , then equation ( [ h_peq ] ) would have two linearly independent solutions satisfying the boundary conditions in ( [ bdcond ] ) .",
    "hence any solution of ( [ h_peq ] ) could be expressed as a linear combination of these solutions .",
    "so there would be no solution of ( [ h_peq ] ) that blows up in either of the two stokes sectors containing the rays in ( [ bdcond ] ) .",
    "this contradicts lemma [ gen_pro ] ( iii ) .",
    "therefore , all eigenvalues are simple .    from now on ,",
    "we denote the stokes sectors @xmath98 as the stokes sectors of ( [ rotated ] ) .",
    "notice , in particular , that the asymptotic expression ( [ asymp - formula ] ) implies that for each @xmath104 , @xmath105 either decays to zero or blows up exponentially , as @xmath2 approaches infinity in closed subsectors of @xmath98 .",
    "also , the asymptotic expression ( [ asymp - formula ] ) implies that if @xmath75 as @xmath76 along one ray in @xmath98 , then @xmath75 as @xmath76 along every ray in @xmath98 .",
    "likewise , if @xmath106 as @xmath76 along one ray in @xmath98 , then @xmath106 as @xmath76 along every ray in @xmath98 .",
    "let @xmath7 be an eigenfunction of @xmath10 .",
    "then the above observation shows that when @xmath107 is odd , the boundary condition ( [ bdcond ] ) for @xmath10 is equivalent to having @xmath73 decaying to zero as @xmath67 along rays in @xmath108 and @xmath109 ( note that the rays @xmath110 are center rays of @xmath108 and @xmath109 ) . also , when @xmath111 is even , the boundary condition ( [ bdcond ] ) for @xmath10 is equivalent to having @xmath112 decaying to zero as @xmath67 along rays in @xmath113 and @xmath109 .",
    "as we saw above , one need not choose the two rays being symmetric , as in ( [ bdcond ] ) , so long as they stay in the stokes sectors that are symmetric with respect to the imaginary axis . next we explain why every solution of ( [ rotated ] ) decays to zero algebraically as @xmath2 tends to infinity along the critical rays . to this end",
    ", we examine the asymptotic expression ( [ asymp - formula ] ) .",
    "certainly , one can check @xmath114 for all @xmath2 on the critical rays , and hence it is not difficult to see that every solution of ( [ rotated ] ) decays to zero algebraically as @xmath2 tends to infinity along the critical rays .",
    "( incidently , the stokes sectors @xmath98 are the sectors where @xmath115 keeps a constant sign . )",
    "one might wonder why we do not consider the eigenvalue problem @xmath116u(z)=\\lambda u(z),\\ ] ] under the boundary condition ( [ bdcond ] ) .",
    "( here we have the opposite sign , compared to ( [ h_peq ] ) , in front of @xmath117 . ) in this case , under the rotation @xmath73 , and @xmath118 if necessary , we see that the two rays in ( [ bdcond ] ) map to two of the critical rays of ( [ rotated ] ) .",
    "so we have algebraic decay of the solution .",
    "thus if we require the eigenfunction be decaying to zero ` exponentially ' , there are no eigenvalues , while if we require the eigenfunction be decaying to zero merely algebraically , then every complex number @xmath3 is an eigenvalue .",
    "and hence we have no interest in this case .",
    "now we are ready to explain how theorem [ main1 ] covers every symmetric rapid decay boundary condition .",
    "when @xmath19 is odd , the equation ( [ h_peq ] ) becomes @xmath119 . in this case , the negative imaginary axis is the center of a stokes sector and the critical rays are @xmath120 for integers",
    "the two rays in ( [ bdcond ] ) are not critical rays and they are , in fact , centers of the stokes sectors . when @xmath19 is increased by @xmath122 , the rays in ( [ bdcond ] ) move , away from the negative imaginary axis , to the centers of adjacent stokes sectors .",
    "so theorem [ main1 ] covers all symmetric rapid decay boundary condition for the potential @xmath123 .",
    "similarly , one can see that when @xmath19 is even , theorem [ main1 ] covers all symmetric rapid decay boundary condition for the potential @xmath124 .",
    "so far in this subsection , we have discussed all possible symmetric decaying boundary conditions , except the `` imaginary axis '' boundary condition discussed at the end of the introduction .",
    "next we briefly mention non - symmetric decaying boundary conditions .",
    "let us consider , as an example , @xmath125u(z)=\\lambda u(z),\\ ] ] under the boundary condition that @xmath63 decays to zero exponentially as @xmath2 tends to infinity along the rays @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "we set @xmath128 , and then @xmath129 solves @xmath130u_1(z)= \\omega^{-1}\\lambda u_1(z),\\ ] ] under the boundary condition ( [ bdcond ] ) with @xmath131 .",
    "then by the results in this paper , theorem [ main1 ] , one can see that @xmath132 is positive real .",
    "hence @xmath3 is not real . in general ,",
    "if we impose a decaying boundary condition along the two rays in some stokes sectors that are not symmetric with respect to the imaginary axis , then the eigenvalues are not positive real .    finally , we mention that the integer @xmath19 in ( [ h_peq ] ) and ( [ bdcond ] ) is the same as the number of stokes sectors between the two sectors where we impose the boundary condition ( [ bdcond ] ) .",
    "next we will introduce sibuya s results , but first we define the order of an entire function @xmath133 as @xmath134 where @xmath135 for @xmath136 . if for some positive real numbers @xmath137 , we have @xmath138 $ ] for all large @xmath139 , then the order of @xmath133 is finite and less than or equal to @xmath22 . in this paper , we choose @xmath140 for @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "now we are ready to introduce some existence results and asymptotic estimates of sibuya @xcite .",
    "the existence of an entire solution with a specified asymptotic representation for fixed @xmath3 , is presented as well as an asymptotic expression of the value of the solution at @xmath143 as @xmath3 tends to infinity .",

    "the work of hille @xcite mentioned in section [ properties ] certainly covers the equation of the form ( [ shin_eq ] ) , and sibuya @xcite studied the more general equation ( [ shin_eq ] ) in a rotated form ( even though in this paper we state only a special case , proposition [ prop ] , of his results for simplicity ) .",
    "so one can check that the material in section [ properties ] has a natural generalization ( see section 2 in @xcite for some generalization ) .",
    "moreover , the spectral determinants in these cases , corresponding to those in lemmas [ equiv ] and [ equiv1 ] , are entire functions of the coefficient vector @xmath420 . hence the eigenvalues @xmath421 are continuous in the coefficient vector @xmath422 . with @xmath423 we know the @xmath424 are all positive real by theorem [ main1 ] in this paper , and so for each @xmath329 there exists a neighborhood of the origin in @xmath425 such that if the coefficient vector @xmath426 lies in this neighborhood , we have @xmath427 .",

    "the author studied the equation ( [ shin_eq ] ) with @xmath16 odd , under the decaying boundary condition at the both ends of the real axis , and proved the eigenvalues @xmath3 lie in the sector @xmath436 under some restriction on the coefficient vector , but still with some large @xmath428 .",
    "so we have a promising method of estimating the arguments of the non - real eigenvalues .",
    "but in the current case , we need to have a reverse induction on @xmath50 . one can check with a little effort that even for @xmath84 , this attempted reverse induction does not give us the desired identities @xmath415 for @xmath107 odd , and @xmath416 for @xmath111 even , that are needed in our proof of theorem [ main ] .",
    "so one needs to show identities like these perhaps in a different way .    finally , a simple way of seeing why this reverse induction on @xmath50 fails is as follows . in establishing the induction step in theorem [ main ]",
    ", we restrict @xmath19 on the interval @xmath437 because we have some technical difficulty that one can see from sentences right before equation ( [ d_unit ] ) , and right after equation ( [ d_unit21 ] ) . from this observation ,",
    "it is not difficult to see that trying to establish a reverse induction step on @xmath50 is essentially the same as trying to establish the forwards induction step on @xmath51 that our method is unable to provide .",
    "( in proving theorem [ main1 ] for @xmath51 , we used the reflection @xmath14 . )",
    "in this paper , we proved that for each integer @xmath11 , eigenvalues @xmath64 of @xmath438 under the boundary condition that @xmath439 exponentially , as @xmath76 along the two rays @xmath440 , are all positive real .",
    "and we studied other boundary conditions . due to asymptotic behavior of the solution @xmath63 near infinity , if the stokes sectors that contain the two ray where we impose the boundary condition are symmetric with respect to the imaginary axis , then the eigenvalues are all positive real , except the case when the two stokes sectors contain the imaginary axis . for all other boundary conditions , either there is no eigenvalue or the eigenvalues are not real",
    ".    it will be interesting to consider the eigenvalue problem with more general polynomial potentials @xmath441 where @xmath83 is a real polynomial with degree less than @xmath16 , under the boundary condition ( [ bdcond ] ) .",
    "it is known that some @xmath52-symmetric oscillators with some cubic and quartic polynomial potentials have non - real eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "one would like to classify when @xmath52-symmetric oscillators with polynomial potentials have non - real eigenvalues ."
