    "our observations caught igr j17091@xmath13624 in the high / soft state , but it is important to note that the source has also showed low / hard state episodes with flaring and apparent jet activity in radio bands @xcite .",

    "[ cont ]    igr j17091@xmath13624 was first observed with _ chandra _ on 2011 august 1 ( obsid 12405 ) , starting at 06:59:16 ( ut ) , for a total of 30  ksec .",
    "the high energy transmission gratings ( hetg ) were used to disperse the incident flux onto the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer spectroscopic array ( acis - s ) . to prevent photon pile - up ,",
    "the acis - s array was operated in continuous clocking or `` graded_cc '' mode , which reduced the nominal frame time from 3.2 seconds to 2.85 msec .",
    "the zeroth order flux is incident on the s3 chip , and frames from this chip can be lost from the telemetry stream if a source is very bright .",
    "we therefore used a gray window over the zeroth order aimpoint ; only one in 10 photons were telemetered within this region . for a longer discussion of this mode ,",
    "please see , e.g. , miller et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and miller et al .",
    "the source was observed for a second time on 2011 october 6 , starting at 11:17:02 ( ut ) , again for a total of 30  ksec .",
    "the relatively low flux observed during the first observation indicated that the acis - s array could be operated in the standard `` timed event '' imaging mode during this second observation .",
    "data reduction was accomplished using ciao version 4.1 @xcite .",
    "time - averaged first - order high energy grating ( heg ) and medium energy grating ( meg ) spectra were extracted from the level-2 event file .",
    "redistribution matrix files ( rmfs ) were generated using the tool `` mkgrmf '' ; ancillary response files ( arfs ) were generated using `` mkgarf '' .",
    "the first - order heg spectra and responses were combined using the tool `` add_grating_orders '' .",
    "the spectra were then grouped to require a minimum of 10 counts per bin .",
    "all spectral analyses were conducted using xspec version 12.6.0 .",
    "all errors quoted in this paper are 1@xmath8 errors .",
    "nearly simultaneous radio observations were made with the evla at each _",

    "the first radio epoch included a two hour integration at 8.4 ghz on 2011 august 2 ( mjd 55776 ) at 1:01:04 ( ut ) , while the second was a two hour integration at both 8.4 and 4.8 ghz on 2011 october 6 ( mjd 55841 ) at 22:10:16 ( ut ) .",
    "the flux and bandpass calibrator was 3c 286 .",
    "the phase and gain calibrators were j1720 - 3552 and j1717 - 3624 , for the first and second observations , respectively .",

    "a black hole mass has not yet been determined for j17091@xmath13624 ; a value of @xmath9 is assumed throughout this work .",
    "preliminary fits to the hetg spectra of igr j17091@xmath13624 suggested a relatively high column density , in keeping with values predicted from radio surveys ( e.g. @xmath10 ; * ? ? ? * ) . due to this high column that predominantly affects lower energies ,",
    "the meg spectra have comparatively low sensitivity as compared to the heg , and were therefore excluded",
    ".    the limitations of the heg and our instrumental configuration enforce an effective lower energy bound of 1.3  kev . in the second observation ,",
    "the instrumental configuration served to enforce an upper limit to the fitting range of 7.6  kev .",
    "this limit was adopted for the first observation as well .",
    "the heg spectra were fit with a fiducial spectral model including an effective h column density ( _ tbabs _ ) , a disk blackbody component , and a power - law component .    the first observation ( mjd 55775 ) is well described by column density of n@xmath11=9.9@xmath12 @xmath13 , and a disk blackbody temperature of 1.3@xmath14 kev .",
    "the resulting fit gave a @xmath15 = 2657/3156 = 0.84 .",
    "this spectrum is dominated by the disk black body component , typical of the high soft state of bhb .",
    "a power - law continuum component is not statistically required .",
    "an unabsorbed flux of f@xmath16 = 1.5@xmath17 ergs @xmath13 s@xmath18 was measured .    the second observation ( mjd 55841 ) also had a consistent flux , f@xmath16 = 1.9 @xmath19 ergs @xmath13 s@xmath18 .",
    "again , the column density was large , at n@xmath11= 1.22@xmath20 @xmath13 . a power - law photon index of @xmath21= 1.7@xmath22 and a disk blackbody temperature of 2.3@xmath23 kev were measured .",
    "this disk temperature is high but common in grs 1915@xmath7105 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the resulting @xmath24 was 2754/3414=0.81 .      in the second heg spectrum",
    ", absorption features are noted in the fe k band ( see figure 1 ) , and these were initially fit with simple gaussians .",
    "the two strongest lines are found at energies of 6.91@xmath25 kev and 7.32@xmath26 . via an f - test ,",
    "( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for some cautions ) , these lines are significant at the 99.94% and 99.67% confidence levels respectively . dividing",
    "the flux normalization of each line by its minus - side error suggests that the feature at 6.91  kev is significant at the 4@xmath8 level of confidence , while the 7.32  kev line is marginal at a 2@xmath8 confidence level .",
    "we also modeled the second observation continuum with a comptonization model ( _ comptt _ ) instead of the disk blackbody and power - law .",
    "in general , this gave a reasonable fit at @xmath27 = 2884/3414 = 0.84 .",
    "this model also showed residual absorption features at high energy , which again we modeled with gaussian functions .",
    "relative to this continuum , the features at 6.91  kev and 7.32  kev are detected at a higher level of significance ( 6@xmath8 ) .",
    "it is reasonable to associate the line at @xmath28  kev with he - like fe xxv , which has a rest energy of 6.70  kev @xcite .",
    "this translates into a blue - shift of 9300@xmath29 km / s .",
    "this feature clearly signals an extreme disk wind in igr j17091@xmath13624 .",
    "typical velocities in x - ray binaries are @xmath30  km / s @xcite . if the feature at 7.32@xmath26 kev is real and can be associated with h - like fe xxvi at 6.97  kev , it would correspond to a blue - shift of 14600@xmath31 .",
    "for additional details , see table [ lines ] .",
    "although less likely , the 6.91  kev line could also be associated with a redshift from the h - like fe xxvi line . the corresponding inflowing velocity would be 2600@xmath32  km / s .",
    "if this is due to gravitational redshift , the corresponding radius would be 1.7@xmath33 cm ( 60@xmath34 ) .",
    "the absence of emission lines in the second spectrum of igr j17091@xmath13624 is notable , but is only suggestive of an equatorial wind . given that disk winds have only been detected in sources viewed at high inclination angles , and given the similarities between igr j17091@xmath13624 and grs 1915@xmath7105 , it is likely that igr j17091@xmath13624 is also viewed at a high inclination .",
    "however , there is no evidence of eclipses in this source , so inclinations above 70@xmath35 can be ruled out .",
    "absorption lines like those detected in the second observation of igr j17091@xmath13624 are absent in the first observation .",
    "fits to the fe k band using a local continuum model , and narrow gaussian functions with fwhm values corresponding to those measured in the second observation give 1@xmath8 confidence limits of 3  ev or less on lines in the 6.707.32  kev band .",
    "this is significantly below the equivalent widths measured in the second observation .",
    "( see table 1 ) this may simply be due to a variable absorption geometry in igr j17091@xmath13624 ; this has previously been observed in h 1743@xmath1322 and grs 1915@xmath7105 @xcite .      to get a better physical picture of the absorption in the second observation of igr 17091@xmath13624",
    ", we also fit the data with a grid of self - consistent photoionization models created with xstar @xcite .",
    "the ionizing luminosity for this model was derived from extrapolating the unabsorbed spectrum from the second observation to 0.013630 kev , ensuring coverage above 8.8 kev , which is required to ionize fe xxv .",
    "a distance of 8.5  kpc is first assumed to derive this luminosity ( l@xmath36=3.5@xmath37 ergs / s ) , owing to the location of j17091@xmath13624 within the galactic bulge .",
    "however , @xcite also suggest the possibility that this source could be accreting at high eddington fractions but further away , and a distance of 25  kpc was also adopted in a second xstar grid ( l@xmath36=3.5@xmath38 ergs / s ) .",
    "the density of the absorbing material was chosen to be log(@xmath39 ) = 12.0 .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption based on the modeling of similar x - ray binaries : gx 13 + 1 , @xmath40 @xmath41@xcite , gro j1655 - 40 , @xmath42 @xmath41@xcite , h1743 - 322 , @xmath43 @xmath41 @xcite . a turbulent velocity of @xmath44  km / s was found to provide the best fit after various trials .",
    "a covering factor of 0.5 was chosen as the absence of emission lines suggests an equatorial wind .",
    "finally , the fe abundance was assumed to be twice the solar value after initial fits ; this characterizes the fe k lines but does not predict absorption lines , e.g. si , that are not observed .",
    "the initial , lower luminosity grid was fit to the data in xspec as a multiplicative model ; free parameters included the column density , ionization , and velocity shifts of the absorbing gas ( see table [ lines ] and figure 2 ) .",
    "for the disk blackbody and power - law continuum , an ionization parameter of @xmath45 = 3.3@xmath46 is required , as well as a wind column density of n = 4.7@xmath47 @xmath13 .",
    "velocity shifts consistent with simple gaussian models are found using the xstar grid .    to fit the putative higher energy absorption , a second outflow component is required .",
    "an additional , lower luminosity xstar component is significant at the @xmath48 level , relative to both continua .",
    "the wind column density was higher at n = 1.7@xmath49 @xmath13 , and the @xmath45 = 3.9@xmath50 .",
    "this system is moving even faster at 15400@xmath32 km / s = 0.05c .",
    "( see table [ lines ] and figure 2 )    repeating this analysis , but utilizing the higher luminosity xstar grid , we find that the two components are again required .",
    "in fact , the values of the column density , ionization and velocity shifts are nearly identical and well within @xmath51 of the previous model .    to derive one estimate to the radius where these winds are launched , we can estimate the radius at which the observed velocity equals the escape velocity .",
    "this constrains the radius to be at @xmath52 cm ( 970 r@xmath5 ) . using @xmath53 and n@xmath54 , where f is the 1-dimensional filling factor",
    ", we can then derive the filling factor and density of the region . assuming the ionizing luminosity is @xmath55 erg / s ,",
    "the resulting filling factor is @xmath56 , and the density is @xmath57 @xmath41 .",
    "however , if the luminosity is higher ( l@xmath36=@xmath58 erg / s ) , the filling factor decreases to @xmath59 , and the density increases to @xmath60 @xmath41 .",
    "these density estimates are quite high when compared to other x - ray binaries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , we can invert the previous argument and instead derive the filling factor and radius from an assumed density , i.e. @xmath43@xmath41 .",
    "we find a larger filling factor , ( @xmath61 ) , and radius , ( @xmath62 cm , 43,300  @xmath63 ) , if we require a luminosity of @xmath55 erg / s .",
    "a larger luminosity , i.e. l@xmath36=@xmath58 erg / s , reduces the filling factor , ( @xmath64 ) but increases the radius ( @xmath65 cm , 100,000  @xmath63 ) . at these radii",
    "the escape velocity is much lower than the observed velocity .",
    "finally , we can estimate the mass outflow rate ( @xmath66 ) using a modified spherical outflow , which can be approximated as @xmath67 . here , we assume a covering factor @xmath68 , and an outflowing velocity of @xmath69  km / s .",
    "a luminosity of @xmath70  erg / s and filling factor of @xmath71 , gives a lower limit of @xmath72 g / s .",
    "however , a much larger outflow rate of @xmath73 g / s is found , if we assume @xmath74  erg / s and filling factor of @xmath75    for comparison , @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is an efficiency factor typically taken to be 10% . for igr j17091@xmath13624 , @xmath78",
    "g / s . using @xmath79 from the disk blackbody and power - law model , we find that the observed portion of the outflow is likely to carry away 0.420 times the amount of accreted gas .",
    "unless a geometrical consideration serves to bias our estimates , a high fraction of the available gas may not accrete onto the black hole .",
    "this trend is not only seen in bhb but in seyferts as well .",
    "@xcite note that more than half of their observed seyferts show @xmath80 .",
    "the evla radio observations at 8.4 ghz were made nearly contemporaneously with their x - ray counterparts .",
    "both radio observations were nearly two hours in duration .",
    "neither observation detected a source at the location of igr j17091@xmath13624 .",
    "the rms noise level for each observation was 0.02 mjy and 0.07 mjy for the two epochs , respectively .",
    "the second observation had extended coverage to 4.8 ghz that also had a non - detection .",
    "the rms for this frequency was 0.13 mjy .",
    "in contrast , igr j17091@xmath13624 was detected at the 12 mjy level during the low / hard state @xcite .",
    "this supports prior findings that the radio jet is absent during the periods when winds are seen in bhb @xcite .",
    "at ionizations above @xmath81 , radiation pressure is inefficient , and it is not able to drive these winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , although the uv components of disk winds in agn are driven at least partially by radiation pressure , the wind in igr j17091@xmath13624 likely can not be driven in this way .",
    "a thermal wind can arise at radii greater than @xmath82 @xcite , where @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the compton temperature of the gas in units of @xmath85  k. the spectrum observed in the second observation gives @xmath86  cm .",
    "therefore , if we assume our conservative estimate of the launching radius , it is possible for igrj17091@xmath13624 to have a thermally driven wind .",
    "however , if the wind originates closer to the black hole , then it is likely that magnetic processes  either pressure from magnetic viscosity within the disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or magneto - centrifugal acceleration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* )  must play a role in launching the wind observed in igr j17091@xmath13624 .",
    "fast x - ray disk winds are not only seen in bhb like igr j17091@xmath13624 , but also in agn and quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the fastest uv winds observed in agn are pushed to high velocities by radiation pressure .",
    "it remains to be seen whether a common driving mechanism works across the black hole mass scale to drive fast , highly ionized x - ray disk winds .",
    "@xcite show that in the quasar apm 08279 + 5255 there are broad absorption features , which are likely highly relativistic fe xxv and/or fe xxvi lines . in these regards",
    ", it bears some similarities to the most extreme winds in bhb s .",
    "observations of bhb point to an anti - correlation of wind and jet outflows from accretion disks @xcite .",
    "winds appear to only be detected , or at least are considerably stronger , in soft , disk  dominated states , and absent in hard states where compact , steady jets are ubiquitous @xcite . in h 1743@xmath1322 , in particular , there is evidence that the absence of winds in hard states is _ not _ an artifact of high ionization hindering the detection of absorption lines , but instead represents a real change in the column density ( and thus the mass outflow rate ) in any wind @xcite .",
    "it appears that our coordinated _",
    "chandra _ and evla observations of igr j17091@xmath13624 support this anti - correlation .",
    "the evla observations place very tight limits on the radio flux when the disk wind is detected , orders of magnitude below the level at which igr j17091@xmath13624 was detected in radio during its low / hard state only a few months prior @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the production of winds may be responsible for quenching jets in grs 1915@xmath7105 .",
    "it might then be the case that jets should be observed whenever winds are absent . in our first observation of igr j17091@xmath13624 , however , neither a wind nor a jet is detected , with tight limits .",
    "instead , the apparent dichotomy between winds and jets may signal the magnetic field topology in and above the disk is state - dependent .",
    "this is broadly consistent with multi - wavelength studies suggesting synchrotron flares above the disk , but only in the hard state ( e.g. gx 339@xmath14 , xte j1118@xmath7480 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is interesting to speculate that the magnetic field might be primarily toroidal in the soft state , where a shakura - sunyaev disk is dominant , but primarily poloidal in the hard state , when the mass accretion rate is lower ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the type of outflow that is observed may also depend greatly on how much mass is loaded onto magnetic field lines ; that could depend on variables including the mass accretion rate through the disk .",
