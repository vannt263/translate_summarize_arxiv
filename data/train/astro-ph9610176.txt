    "photon - photon pair production of high energy -rays on the diffuse extragalactic background radiation ( debra ) significantly limits the distance that such -rays can propagate ( @xcite , @xcite ) . for -rays energies above a few tev ,",
    "this distance is almost certainly @xmath3 mpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , most of the vhe universe is not visible to us .",
    "nevertheless , we can detect the presence of vhe emission via the lower - energy , secondary radiation produced in the cascades initiated by the vhe photons .",
    "( the energy carried by absorbed vhe -rays is not lost ; the electron - positron pairs produced create new -rays by inverse compton scattering on background field photons and can trigger an electromagnetic pair cascade . ) in principle , this radiation could be detected from an individual source as a halo about the source ( @xcite , @xcite ) , but an easier way to detect or constrain vhe emission is to look for the diffuse cascade background produced by the ensemble of all vhe sources in the universe .",
    "in particular , the spectrum of this secondary cascade radiation is rather insensitive to the spectrum of the primary vhe radiation , and therefore the total level of the cascade background acts as a particle detector calorimeter , allowing us to measure the total vhe energy input into the universe .",
    "this was first pointed out in the context of detecting an extragalactic population of high - energy cosmic rays ( @xcite ) . however , cosmic rays are not the only possible sources of vhe radiation .",
    "the physical conditions in powerful , non - thermal extragalactic sources like active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and radio galaxies could lead to the acceleration of particles to very high energies ( e.g. , see the review of hillas 1984 ) , and depending on exactly where acceleration occurs , agn can easily contain enough target matter ( e.g. , strong photon fields ) to convert efficiently this particle energy into high energy radiation . indeed , the nearby blazar agn mrk 421 and 501 do emit tev -rays .",
    "also , several `` exotic '' particle physics / early universe scenarios have been proposed that lead to the generation of extremely high energy charged particles and photons at late times ( e.g. , from decaying primordial black holes or gut - scale particles and topological defects ) .",
    "these scenarios can produce a large vhe cascade background , and tight constraints on them result from requiring that : ( i ) the level of the cascade background today not exceed the observed extragalactic -ray background , and ( ii ) the level of the background at high redshifts not be enough to alter primordial nucleosynthesis ( e.g. , see the review by @xcite ) .    in this paper ,",
    "we re - examine and quantify the constraints placed on a cosmological vhe source population by requiring that its cascade background not exceed the -ray background observed today .",
    "we are motivated by two considerations .",
    "first , egret has provided us with a determination of the diffuse extragalactic background at @xmath4 gev ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is the energy range where the expected cascade backgrounds are typically most insensitive to model parameters and from which we thus obtain the most robust constraints .",
    "second , the prior work we are aware of either does not accurately compute the cascade radiation spectrum or only considers cascading on the microwave portion of the debra . the use of a realistic debra , i.e. , one that includes an infrared / optical ( ir / o ) component , is key as it leads to much tighter cascading constraints .",
    "except for the microwave background ( mbr ) , our current knowledge of the debra and its evolution in time is limited . in  2 of the paper ,",
    "we illustrate the uncertainties in the propagation of vhe photons corresponding to these uncertainties in the debra . these can be significant and should not be forgotten when evaluating claims based on calculations of vhe photon absorption and cascading . in  3 , we calculate the cascade backgrounds expected for different ir / o background fields and vhe source population models . using decaying particles from topological defects ( hypothesized as a possible source for the highest energy cosmic rays ) and agn as example populations ,",
    "we show how interesting and straightforward astrophysical source constraints can be derived  _ despite _ the uncertainties in the debra .",
    "we summarize our results in  4 and discuss their implications for future high energy -ray experiments .",
    "the distance a vhe photon propagates in the universe is determined by the intensity of the intervening debra . for small emission redshifts ,",
    "the photon propagation length at energy @xmath5 is @xmath6^{-1}$ ] where @xmath7 ev and @xmath8 is the background energy density at energy @xmath9 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in other words , there is a rough one - to - one mapping between @xmath10 and the background intensity at @xmath11 a determination of @xmath10 via the detection of an absorption cutoff in a spectrum thus measures the background at @xmath9 ( and _ only _",
    "@xmath9 ! )  a possibility that has aroused much interest given the observational difficulties in extracting the extragalactic ir / o background from the galactic / solar system foregrounds .",
    "conversely , to understand vhe photon propagation , we require accurate knowledge of the debra , in particular at ir / o energies . unfortunately , direct measurements of the ir / o background ( @xcite )",
    "are at best preliminary .",
    "theoretical estimates for the debra exist ( e.g. , @xcite ) but are also rather uncertain .",
    "consequently , our estimates for the propagation lengths of vhe photons emitted today are similarly uncertain .",
    "we summarize these uncertainties in fig .",
    "1 . they are not small . in the ultra - high photon energy range ( @xmath12 ev ) , they arise from problems in determining the low - frequency cutoffs of extragalactic radio sources . in the gev - tev range ,",
    "the uncertainties reflect our poor understanding of galaxy formation and evolution ( e.g. , see @xcite , @xcite for detailed discussions ) .    for a vhe photon emitted at redshifts @xmath13",
    "an added complication arises . as it propagates , the photon s energy is redshifted and at any given redshift @xmath14 the photon interacts most strongly with local background photons of energy @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the energy of the vhe photon at @xmath17 therefore , to estimate the probability for this photon to be absorbed , we need good estimates for the debra over a range of energies _ and _ over a range of redshifts .",
    "a common assumption is that the debra was produced in a burst at @xmath18 like the mbr , so that the debra photon density also scales as @xmath19 $ ] ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , galaxy emission , the likely source of the ir / o debra , evolves in time as galaxy stellar populations evolve , and galaxies still emit significant amounts of light today ( i.e. , their emission burst is not over ) .",
    "the exact epoch of galaxy formation is highly controversial , but formation redshifts as low as @xmath20 are commonly considered . in other words ,",
    "the evolution of the non - mbr debra could deviate considerably from the @xmath21 law .",
    "consequently , uncertainties in the debra actually have a greater impact on -ray propagation than implied by fig .",
    "1 . this is not always appreciated . in fig .",
    "2 , we show for several debra evolutionary scenarios the observed cutoff energy , @xmath22 in the spectrum of a vhe source located at redshift @xmath23 in curves ( i ) and ( vi ) of fig.2 , we show @xmath24 for roughly the minimum ( tyson 1995 ) and maximum ( dwek & slavin 1994 ) allowed ir / o levels today : @xmath25 for ( i ) and @xmath26 for ( vi ) , where for an order of magnitude estimate , we assume the background goes as @xmath27 in both cases , we scale the debra back in redshift as @xmath28,$ ] and we assume @xmath29 has _ no _ optical / uv cutoff ( e.g. , a lyman limit ) . while convenient , note that obtaining the debra at high redshifts in this way , i.e. , extrapolating it from the debra today , can be dangerous",
    ". most likely , the today s debra is a complicated superposition of light emitted at various redshifts . by extrapolating from the current debra",
    ", we make an implicit , but often unrealistic and unphysical assumption about the spectra of the sources contributing to the debra , especially when the source spectra contain sharp cutoffs , e.g. , a lyman limit . as an example , assume that because of the lyman limit , the current debra cuts off sharply above , say , 5 ev . extrapolating to @xmath30",
    "we now find a debra that cuts off sharply only above 15 ev , and we could conclude that the debra at that epoch was due to sources with strong emission above the lyman limit ( 13.6 ev )  rather unlikely if the sources are galaxies .",
    "now , the absorption cutoff in distant sources like agn depends critically on the debra intensity at optical / uv energies ( i.e. , near the lyman limit ) , so one must be very careful about the optical / uv debra evolution . in curve ( v ) , we compute @xmath24 for the debra of curve ( vi ) except that we assume the debra was produced in a burst at @xmath31 and that no photons were emitted above the lyman limit during the burst . in this case",
    ", the debra at @xmath32 still scales as @xmath21 , but there are no photons present above @xmath33 ev .",
    "note the large discrepancy between curves ( v ) and ( vi ) at high @xmath23    curves ( i ) and ( vi ) are probably fairly good as absolute upper and lower bounds for @xmath24 at a given @xmath34 but the assumptions underlying them are not very realistic . to give better examples of the effects of debra evolution , we assume that the ir / o debra is the integrated light from galaxies , and that galaxies have two distinct spectral components : direct / optical uv emission from stars , and ir emission from dust which reprocesses the starlight .",
    "we allow the component luminosities to vary ( independently ) with redshift , but we keep their spectral shapes fixed and choose them to match the intermediate age spectra in mazzei , xu , & dezotti ( 1992 ) .",
    "this prescription can reproduce fairly well more sophisticated calculations and allows one to efficiently explore a variety of galaxy evolutionary scenarios . in curve ( iv )",
    ", we show the results for a scenario of the type proposed in franceschini _ et al . _",
    "( 1994 ) where galaxies and stars form very early in the universe , and the debra is dominated by light produced during the initial burst of star formation .",
    "the calculation shown assumes most stars / galaxies were formed at a formation redshift @xmath35 and the intensity and evolution of the spectral components were adjusted to give roughly the ir / o debra spectrum ( for @xmath36 ) shown in franceschini _",
    "_ 1994 . in curves",
    "( ii ) and ( iii ) , we show what might happen if galaxies are instead formed at later times , as suggested by cosmological numerical simulations and as discussed by macminn & primack ( 1995 ) . in curve ( ii ) , we assume galaxies form late , at @xmath37 and adjust the spectral component intensities and intensity evolution to roughly match those in the hcdm ( hot - cold dark matter)-based calculation of macminn & primack ( 1995 ) . in curve ( iii ) , we assume galaxies form at intermediate redshifts @xmath38 and adjust the component intensity evolution to match the cdm ( cold dark matter)-based calculation of macminn & primack ( 1995 ) . although the models shown probably do not produce enough uv light ( e.g. , as compared to madau & phinney 1996 ) and @xmath24 could be somewhat lower at high @xmath34 the curves in fig .",
    "2 should be indicative of the large range of possibilities due to the current uncertainties in the debra .",
    "consequently , one should be wary of extrapolating a determination of @xmath24 at one redshift to other redshifts without extra information ( the curves in fig . 2 intersect ! ) .",
    "for example , an exact measurement of the ir / o debra today would not be sufficient to allow a precise determation of the hubble constant via the absorption cutoffs in distant ( @xmath39 ) sources .",
    "finally , one should be careful when claiming an unidentified source , e.g. , a -ray burst , is closer than a certain redshift because it shows no vhe absorption .",
    "while the ir / o debra uncertainty is significant , it is not enough to allow vhe photon emitted above @xmath2 1 tev to propagate more than a few hundred mpc ( see fig . 1 ; and note that the debra intensity generally increases with redshift ) .",
    "similarly , cascading typically takes less than a few hundred mpc to reprocess an absorbed vhe photon s energy into that of many photons with individual energies well below a tev .",
    "thus , for cosmological source populations like agn that span gpc distance scales , it is a reasonable approximation to assume a vhe photon is transformed instantaneously into sub - tev photons .",
    "this is the primary reason vhe cascading is such a powerful diagnostic : essentially _ any _ energy emitted above 1 tev re - emerges below 1 tev , where we can detect it .",
    "the second is that for vhe photon energies above @xmath40 tev , the cascade spectrum at lower energies is very insensitive to the initial vhe photon energy distribution and only weakly sensitive to the details of the ir / o background distribution ( which determines exactly where below 1 tev the energy ends up , i.e. , @xmath24 ) .",
    "the latter point , recognized as early as strong , wdowczyk , & wolfendale ( 1973 ) , is key but has not been widely appreciated .",
    "the spectrum for a cascade started at @xmath41 goes roughly as @xmath42 for @xmath43 and as @xmath44 for @xmath45 where @xmath46 ^ 2 $ ] gev and typically @xmath47 ( coppi & knigl 1996 ) the portion of this spectrum which is relevant to 100 mev - gev observations and also contains most of the cascade energy is the @xmath48 component , and not as usually believed , the @xmath49 component .",
    "changing the ir / o background changes @xmath24 but not the total observed cascade energy .",
    "hence , the cascade photon spectrum amplitude goes ( roughly ) as @xmath50 i.e. , it is rather insensitive to @xmath24 and thus the ir / o background .",
    "now , the spectrum from a population of sources is simply the sum of cascade spectra for a range of @xmath17 below @xmath51 the cutoff energy for the average @xmath52 of the vhe source population , the summed cascade spectrum then goes roughly as @xmath48 and is similarly insensitive to the ir / o background .",
    "( however , the spectrum above @xmath53_does _ depend strongly on the background . )",
    "if we can measure or constrain the -ray background below @xmath51 we can robustly constrain the vhe source population luminosity .",
    "the preceding arguments need to be backed up by a rigorous calculation .",
    "we have developed a new code that solves the exact cascade kinetic equations implicitly ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the main advantages of our code over past ones are : ( i ) it does not have to confront problems of monte carlo particle statistics and is typically much faster , and ( ii ) because it is implicit , it can efficiently follow the cascade into the thomson regime where cascade electrons lose energy in very small steps and thus accurately compute the low - energy ( @xmath54 gev ) cascade spectrum . the accuracy in this energy range  the range needed to compare with -ray observations  has been a problem in past work ( e.g. , @xcite ) , especially given that small errors at high energies extrapolate to large errors at low energies .",
    "the cosmological ( redshift ) terms in the kinetic equations are handled in the same manner as protheroe & stanev ( 1993 ) .",
    "we present two sample numerical calculations which demonstrate the power of the vhe cascade constraint .",
    "the first , shown in fig .",
    "3 , is motivated by the possibility that the highest energy cosmic rays ( @xmath55 ev ) might be explained as decay products of massive ( @xmath56 gev ) primordial particles / topological defects ( e.g. , see @xcite for a recent review ) . for this calculation",
    ", we assume the intergalactic magnetic field ( igmf ) exceeds @xmath57 g , so that the initial cascading is suppressed by synchrotron losses , and we can approximate the initial decay products as photons of energy @xmath58 ev ( e.g. , see @xcite ) . taking the integral cosmic ray flux above @xmath59 ev to be @xmath60 ( @xcite,@xcite ) , one can easily show that the current energy release rate required to explain such a flux is @xmath61[e_{\\rm max}/10^{24}{\\rm ev}]^{1/2}\\   { \\rm ev}\\ { \\rm cm}^{-3 } { \\rm s}^{-1}$ ] if the observed cosmic rays are protons , and @xmath62^{1/2 } [ \\lambda_\\gamma/10{\\rm mpc}]^{-1}$ ] if they are photons .",
    "here @xmath63 is the number ratio of @xmath64 particles to protons produced in a decay , @xmath65 is the photon absorption mean free path at @xmath66 ev ( probably between @xmath67 mpc , see fig .",
    "1 ) , and we assume the decay product energy spectrum is @xmath42 extending to energy @xmath68 ( for most models , @xmath69 lies in the range @xmath70 ev . )",
    "the dependence of the cascade background on the ir / o debra increases with stronger decay rate evolution , but below @xmath71 is remarkably small , between 1 - 10 gev . for the optimal case of constant comoving decay rate",
    ", the egret measurement constrains the local energy release rate to be @xmath72 thus , if the cosmic ray events above @xmath73 ev are caused by protons , we can firmly rule out a primordial particle / defect scenario as their origin .",
    "this conclusion does not depend strongly on the details of the ir / o debra or the igmf strength .",
    "if the high energy events are instead due to -rays , we also find strong constraints , but with some caveats concerning the igmf .",
    "if the igmf exceeds @xmath57 g , then fig .",
    "3 shows the standard scenarios are at best marginally allowed .",
    "( this agrees with the conclusions of chi _ et al _ 1992 , even though they appear to have significantly overestimated the expected cascade background . )",
    "however , if the igmf is weak ( @xmath74 g ) , the initial cascading effectively increases the mean free path of @xmath59 ev photons to @xmath75 mpc and in this case a decay scenario is _ not _ ruled out ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "blazar agn are known to emit at gev energies and , in fact , may dominate the observed gev background ( e.g. , see @xcite and references therein ) . if this were the case , the vhe source luminosity constraints would of course tighten considerably .",
    "in fact , they appear rather interesting when applied to radio - loud agn , the parent population of blazars , and to agn in general . as an illustration , we repeated ( see fig .",
    "4 ) the background calculation of stecker & salamon ( 1996 ) , making exactly the same assumptions about the blazar luminosity function .",
    "however , we also took into account vhe photon absorption and cascading and considered various values for the typical maximum blazar emission energy .",
    "the level of the expected cascade background depends on the value of the igmf and the exact relation between the apparent luminosity -ray of blazars measured by egret ( which is enhanced by relativistic beaming ) and the intrinsic ( unbeamed ) -ray luminosity of blazars , and their parent population , radio - loud quasars .",
    "when the igmf exceeds @xmath76 g , the pairs in a vhe cascade are deflected sufficiently that the vhe luminosity of a blazar is effectively `` debeamed . ''",
    "the contribution from an individual blazar to the cascade background is then dramatically reduced , by a currently unknown factor between @xmath77 ( if the typical egret blazar luminosity corresponds to quasi - steady emission ) and @xmath78 ( if it corresponds to strong , flaring emission ) . here",
    ", @xmath79 is the typical doppler boost factor for blazars , probably @xmath80 in the high igmf case , this decrease in the contribution from individual blazars can be partially or completely compensated by the @xmath77 times larger number of radio - loud agn ( blazars pointing away from us ) that are now visible in -rays via their cascade radiation .",
    "the cascade backgrounds shown in fig . 4 apply to the cases when the igmf is very low ( the cascade is essentially rectilinear ) or when the boost in the apparent blazar luminosity is @xmath81 if one of these cases holds and the assumptions of stecker & salamon ( 1996 ) are correct , then typical blazar spectra must break strongly at @xmath2 100 gev or blazars do not explain the gev background . (",
    "note that the precise value of the break energy depends strongly on the ir / o debra , the blazar luminosity function , and the distribution of blazar -ray spectral indices , all of which are poorly known . )",
    "ignoring blazars and beaming effects , we can play a similar game with quasars as a whole .",
    "assume all quasars isotropically emit -rays with a @xmath82 spectrum up to some maximum energy , and that , as speculated , their direct emission explains the 100mev - gev background .",
    "if quasar -ray emission scales with optical emission , then using the boyle _",
    "( 1991 ) quasar luminosity function , we find that for every decade quasar emission extends above @xmath83 gev ( e.g. , @xcite predict spectra extending to @xmath84 ev for radio - quiet agn ) , cascading overproduces the background by a factor of @xmath85 ; cascading should _ not _ be ignored in a gev background calculation involving blazars or quasars .",
    "since the cascade energy flux falls in the same range as the egret observations ( fig .",
    "3 ) , we can make a quick estimate of the maximum average vhe emissivity allowed in the universe by equating the cascade background energy flux accumulated over a cosmological distance scale ( @xmath86 where @xmath87 gpc ) with the observed egret energy flux above 100 mev , @xmath88 @xmath89 for source populations with no or moderate cosmological evolution , the more exact calculation of fig .",
    "3 gives an upper limit @xmath90 for @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "this is not a large number . in a hubble volume @xmath93",
    "this represents a total vhe source luminosity @xmath94 this can be compared , say , to the bolometric luminosity of a single powerful quasar @xmath95 which as discussed , implies that agn do not emit much of their luminosity at vhe energies .",
    "as we have shown , this limit is rather insensitive to details of the ir / o background and applies to _ any _ cosmological population with significant vhe emission above @xmath40 tev , e.g. , any galaxy or cluster population with strong cosmic ray production at some stage in its history",
    ". it will be interesting to see how much of the gev -ray background future instruments like glast can resolve . if , as suspected , most of the background is non - cascade blazar emission , the vhe cascade limits tighten and become even more interesting .",
    "in particular , depending on the igmf and the details of blazar beaming , they could imply that typical blazar agn show an _ intrinsic _ spectral break ( not due to debra absorption ) at @xmath96 gev  which would be an important constraint for blazar models . at the same time , though , a few agn ( e.g. , mkn 421 ) _ are _ effective vhe emitters , and there is no shortage of ideas for producing vhe emission by other means ( e.g. , the decaying topological defects discussed here ) .",
    "any residual background surviving a fluctuation / point source analysis could well be vhe cascade emission .",
    "detection of a cascade background , especially in the cutoff region @xmath97 gev , provides combined information on the evolution of the underlying vhe source population and the ir / o background ( i.e. , galaxies ) . for a low ir / o background ,",
    "the cascade background is quite hard .",
    "a glast detector with sufficient sensitivity to the diffuse -ray background up to 100 gev could set even tighter limits on vhe source populations ( or more easily detect a cascade background ) .",
