    "while the nuclear zone of the milky way can be studied in exquisite detail , it is a single example .",
    "we therefore want to understand which of its features are unique to the milky way and which are generally found in nuclear regions of spiral galaxies",
    ". the milky way s nuclear region , that we take to be the extent of the central molecular zone ( cmz ) , can be characterized by a modest star formation rate ( sfr ) , quiet super - massive black hole ( smbh ) accreting at very low levels , and indications for a past nuclear outflow or wind in the form of the fermi bubble ( su et al .",
    "2010 ) . is this a normal mix of conditions for spiral cmzs , and if so how do they vary with the evolutionary phases of the regions ?",
    "our group is particularly interested in how conditions in the cmzs of galaxies affect their high energy @xmath0-ray emission and potential as sources of high energy neutrinos ( see yoast - hull et al .",
    "this volume ) .",
    "here we address these issues through comparisons between the milky way s cmz and those of four nearby ( d @xmath1 4.5  mpc ) barred spiral galaxies .",
    "we focus on star forming properties , as primary drivers of the observable properties in these inactive nuclei .",
    "while most massive galaxies contain nuclear star clusters , probably inhabited by smbh and containing some young stars , the level and extent of star formation in their cmzs varies .",
    "for example , while nuclear star clusters of spiral galaxies , including that in m31 , frequently contain young stars e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* matthews et al . 1999 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* walcher et al . 2006 ) , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lauer et al . 2012 ) , their cmzs cover a large range of conditions , including being all but non - existent .",
    "the galaxies in our sample all have cmzs resembling that in the milky way in containing molecular gas and supporting star formation .",
    "here we briefly summarize the characteristics of the galaxies and their cmzs .",
    "distances and total optical absolute magnitudes were taken from the literature .",
    "we measured h - band absolute magnitudes for each cmz via aperture photometry on images in the 2mass _ large galaxy atlas _",
    "( jarrett et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the 2mass images were also used to derive updated structural types ( see figure  1 ) . note that the cmzs are resolved and stand out in surface brightness in all 4 systems .",
    "the presence of bars is especially relevant since the milky way is a barred galaxy and bars have the ability to foster gas flows in nuclear regions .",
    "an assessment of the evolutionary rates of this sample rests on measuring sfrs and understanding the mass balance and structure of the ism in the cmz .",
    "the former is difficult due to the practical issue of determining sfrs in dense and often highly obscured regions .",
    "the mass balance of the ism is influenced by mass inflows ( e.g. , via bars ) and outflows ( e.g. , from winds ) from the cmzs , while structural data require mapping of complex , multi - phase ism .",
    "for this initial study we therefore focused on the current mass of molecular material that we take from published values .",
    "_ milky way : _ we adopt a classification of sabbc : for the structure of the milky way and assign it an absolute magnitude of m@xmath221 . even though several details remain unclear , our home galaxy is a typical giant spiral .",
    "we also adopt m@xmath33 @xmath410@xmath5  m@xmath6 for the milky way s cmz .",
    "_ ic  342 : _ this lumnous sabcd galaxy is weakly barred at a distance of 3.5  mpc and has an absolute magnitude of m@xmath722 .",
    "the cmz m@xmath32 @xmath410@xmath5  m@xmath6 is from schinnerer et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .    _ maffei  2 : _ although highly obscured by the milky way in the foreground , near - infrared images show maffei  2 to be a well organized sbbc : spiral at d@xmath83.9  mpc . due to the large foreground extinction ,",
    "the optical magnitude of maffei  2 is highly uncertain , but it probably is the least luminous galaxy in our sample .",
    "the cmz molecular disk is located within a gas - rich bar and contains m@xmath35@xmath410@xmath5  m@xmath6 of gas ( meier et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "_ m83 : _ the most distant member of our sample at d@xmath84.5  mpc , m83 is an sbc system with m@xmath721 . its nucleus recently supported a starburst that produced a uv - bright region of young stars .",
    "the m83 cmz has m@xmath35",
    "@xmath4 10@xmath5  m@xmath6 ( muraoka et al . 2009 ) .    _ ngc  253 : _ ngc  253 is a luminous , m@xmath722 sbc system with active star formation across the galaxy and especially in its starburst nucleus .",
    "we adopt d@xmath83.9  mpc .",
    "the galaxy is highly inclined and the starburst cmz also shows an inclined , disky structure ( sakamoto et al .",
    "estimates for m@xmath9 range from @xmath1010@xmath11  m@xmath6 from sakamoto et al . to 3 @xmath4 10@xmath11  m@xmath6 derived by weiss et al .",
    "( 2008 ) from a submillimeter dust mass determination .",
    "sakamoto et al . also note the similarity between the molecular structures of the ngc  253 and milky way cmzs .",
    "star formation rate estimates are derived from thermal infrared and radio fluxes in the literature converted to sfrs following the prescriptions of kennicutt & evans ( 2012 ) , and are uncertain by factors of a few .",
    "for example , the cmz sfr in m@xmath6  yr@xmath12 for the milky way cover the range of 0.05@xmath1 sfr @xmath10 0.15 . for this pilot project",
    "we adopted estimates of the sfrs of 0.1 m@xmath6  yr@xmath12 for ic  342 and maffei  2 , 0.5 - 1 m@xmath6  yr@xmath12 for m83 , and 3 - 10 m@xmath6  yr@xmath12 for ngc  253 .",
    "our future work on this topic will incorporate more systematic determinations of the cmz sfrs .",
    "we see that sfrs vary by factors of at least @xmath13100 while total molecular gas mass in the cmz varies by only a factor of @xmath1310 ; the significant differences in the star formation efficiency are shown in figure  2 that also illustrates the factor of 10 spread in sfrs at similar m@xmath9 . a simple kennicutt - schmidt near linear relationship between gas surface density and sfr",
    "evidently does not readily apply in these cmzs .",
    "figure  3 shows a comparison between the @xmath0-ray flux for the milky way and ngc  253 obtained by assuming both systems are at the distance of ngc  253 .",
    "the offset between the two galaxies is a factor of @xmath1310@xmath14 , comparable to the ratio of their sfrs but much larger than the factor @xmath1310 difference in gas mass ( see also yoast - hull et al . , these proceedings ) .",
    "time scales to exhaust current gas supplies assuming that star formation is the only sink extend from @xmath130.3 - 0.5  gyr for the milky way and maffei  2 to @xmath15100  myr for m83 and ngc  253 .",
    "outflows via winds will further reduce time scales to exhaust nuclear region gas supplies .",
    "the cmz of ngc  253 supports a strong wind ( e.g. , westmoquette et al .",
    "2011 ) , reducing the time scale to exhaust m@xmath9 in ngc  253 to @xmath1310  myr , or roughly the age of the present starburst , in the absence of gas inflows .",
    "the short gas exhaustion time scales indicate that gas flows into the centers of galaxies are required to fuel star formation .",
    "the h - band absolute magnitudes of the cmzs in this sample , ( aside from the milky way where we lack this information , are -19.9@xmath160.1 except for ic342 whose nucleus appears to be about 1 magnitude fainter . although interstellar obscuration and stellar population ages naturally complicate the relationship between absolute h - band magnitude and stellar mass , we simply assume that the similar h - band luminosities of the cmzs indicate similar stellar masses of @xmath13 10@xmath17  m@xmath6 . in this case",
    "the lifetime average sfrs of the cmzs also must be similar at about 0.1  m@xmath6  yr@xmath12 .",
    "this point and the short gas exhaustion time scales indicate that current sfrs do not necessarily reflect lifetime means for these cmzs .",
    "this exploratory investigation thus suggests that star formation is episodic in the nuclei of galaxies like the milky way .",
    "this possibility is not new ( e.g. , loose , krgel , & tutukov 1982 ) and also has support from recent studies ( schinnerer , bker , & meier 2003 , su , slatyer , & finkbeiner 2010 ; also bally et al . and",
    "su et al . in this volume ) .",
    "the cmz of the milky way has the lowest star forming activity in the sample , and thus is likely to be in a low sfr evolutionary phase .",
    "-rays are shown for the cmzs of the milky way and ngc  253 assuming both galaxies are at the same distance .",
    "the @xmath0-ray data and models for their emission are described by yoast - hull et al .",
    "( 2014 ) and yoast - hull et al . in this volume .",
    ", width=307 ]    in the future it will be useful to develop consistent sets of measurements for the cmzs in nearby galaxies .",
    "for example , deriving sfrs and m@xmath9 from similar types of observations will help to confirm the veracity of differences in the properties of nuclear regions .",
    "better mass determinations , both from model fits to gas kinematics and from stellar population spectral synthesis based on near infrared spectroscopy also will be valuable .",
    "in addition the structures of the cmzs matter in building an improved understanding of how their various components interact , including cosmic rays and the central smbh . a better knowledge of the nuclear zones in neighboring galaxies , both with and without agn , will enhance the value of explorations of the central zone of the milky way ."
