    "it is widely considered that rare decays of @xmath5 can offer an ideal opportunity to study non - perturbative qcd effects and the underlying dynamics @xcite . on other aspect ,",
    "compared with the extensive studies of strong and electromagnetic decays of @xmath5 , both experimental and theoretical investigations of weak decays of @xmath5 are much behind due to their small fractions .",
    "thanks to the progress in accelerator and detector techniques , interest in the weak decays of charmonium is being resurgent .",
    "with incomparably large database on @xmath5 and other @xmath6family members , the bes collaboration will measure some rare decays including the semi - leptonic @xcite and non - leptonic modes @xcite with high accuracy , and more further theoretical and experimental studies would follow .",
    "theoretically , the semileptonic decays of @xmath5 induced by the flavor changing currents were analyzed in our earlier work @xcite , where the qcd sum rules ( qcdsr ) approach @xcite was employed to compute the transition form factors .",
    "subsequently , by utilizing the form factors obtained in terms of qcdsr we carried out computations on the rates of non - leptonic decays of @xmath5 @xcite under the factorization assumption . very recently , weak decay of @xmath5 into the final states involving a pseudoscalar meson were also studied by authors of ref .",
    "@xcite where the covariant light front quark model was employed , thus their result can be regarded as a cross check of that estimated in qcdsr .    at the quark level , the decay of @xmath5 induced by the flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc )",
    "is realized via @xmath7 transition , which should be very small due to the glashow - iliopoulos - maiani ( gim ) mechanism @xcite , whereas at the hadron level the long - distance effects may have the same order of magnitude .",
    "although the fcnc processes for @xmath8 and @xmath9 cases are comprehensively studied , the fcnc decays in the charmed mesons has not caught enough attention due to the stronger gim suppression for up - type quarks , which is also responsible for smallness of @xmath10 mixing @xcite . as aforementioned , the progress of detection techniques and facilities allows much more accurate measurements on the rare decays , so theoretically we need to calculate the production rates and see if the expected precision is indeed possible to observe a non - zero fraction at the updated facilities .",
    "thus , in this work , we would like to take a step forward to investigate the fcnc processes @xmath11 in the standard model .",
    "following the procedure given in ref .",
    "@xcite , we will employ the three - point qcdsr to derive the form factors .",
    "the qcdsr has been proved to be an effective tool to calculate various hadronic matrix elements where non - perturbative qcd effects dominate .",
    "the sum rule technique for three - point correlation functions was first used to describe the pion electromagnetic form factor at intermediate momentum transfer @xcite and hence this approach has been applied to various weak decays @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach is the light - cone sum rules where the light - cone distribution amplitudes of hadrons are employed @xcite to calculate the form factors in similar processes . in this work ,",
    "we only concentrate ourselves in the qcdsr . to evaluate a transition process , calculation of three - point correlation function",
    "is needed and obviously it is much more complicated than the calculations of two - point correlations .",
    "the structure of this paper is organized as follows : after this introduction , we will firstly display the effective hamiltonian relevant to the semileptonic decay @xmath12 and then derive the sum rules for the form factors in section [ the standard procedure ] .",
    "the wilson coefficients of various operators contributing to the correlation functions are calculated in much detail in section [ wilson coefficients ] making use of the operator product expansion technique .",
    "in particular , the wilson coefficients of gluon condensate and quark gluon mixing operator are dealt with in the fixed - point gauge , i.e. , @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , the inputs for the numerical computations of form factors are presented at the beginning of section [ numerical results ] , and then an extensive analysis of sum rules of the form factors are performed .",
    "we explicitly show the borel platform where the form factors are stable with respect to variations of the borel masses @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the rates of semileptonic decays @xmath5 to @xmath16 are numerically evaluated in section [ decay rate ] , and the last section is devoted to our discussions and conclusions .",

    "in this section we calculate the wilson coefficients . to guarantee sufficient theoretical accuracy , the correlation functions are required to be expanded up to dimension-5 operators , namely quark - gluon mixing condensate .",
    "the dimension-6 operators , such as the four quark condensates , are small and further suppressed by @xmath98 , so can be safely neglected in our calculations .",

    "the results of form factors are in proportion to the inverse of decay constants of the charmed mesons and @xmath5 , which can be easily observed from the definitions of correlation functions .",
    "the uncertainties from decay constants of charmed mesons and @xmath5 are at the level of 10 % , which can bring up about 10 % uncertainty to form factors at zero momentum transfer , but it would not affect the values of parameters @xmath101 and @xmath102 which are used to parameterize the @xmath103 dependence of the form factors . besides , the error bars corresponding to the changes of condensate parameters are tiny , since only gluon condensate can contribute to the sum rules , whose effect is at the order of a few percents for tensor density transition .",
    "moreover , one can also see that the corrections from the light quark masses are not significant because the role of light quark masses is suppressed by a much larger energy scale of borel masses .",
    "in addition , the uncertainty caused by the charm quark mass is at the one percent level @xcite .",
    "we neglect the @xmath104 corrections to the perturbative part , which is expected to be quite small , and should not result in a drastic shift to the final results .    in principle , the results of the form factors presented here can be further improved by including the non - local quark condensate @xcite together with @xmath105 power correction .",
    "the former correction can result in a non - vanishing contribution of the diagram ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ wilson coefficients graph ] even after performing the double borel transformation on two variables @xmath106 and @xmath107 , however , it almost has no effect on the decay rates , but only can moderate the @xmath103 dependence of the form factors .",
    "the physical explanation of this effect is that quarks in the physical vacuum may have a non - vanishing momentum @xcite .",
    "the latter correction will lead to the non - zero contributions of heavy - quark condensate and heavy quark - gluon mixing condensate to the sum rules for the form factors .",
    "with the form factors obtained above , we can calculate decay rates of semi - leptonic decays @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the related parameters are listed below @xcite : @xmath110 for the semi - leptonic decay @xmath111(@xmath112 ) , the differential partial decay rate can be written as @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 ; @xmath116 and @xmath117 are the momenta of @xmath118 and @xmath119 respectively ; the factor `` @xmath120 '' comes from the average of the spin states of @xmath5 ; @xmath121 is the decay amplitude after integrating over the angle between the @xmath118 and @xmath16 .",
    "the upper and lower bounds of @xmath67 are given as @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the energies of the charmonium state and the lepton in the rest frame of lepton pair respectively @xmath125    besides , the explicit form of the decay amplitude @xmath126 of @xmath127 is written as @xmath128 then we can obtain the branching ratios for semi - leptonic decay of @xmath129 and @xmath16 as @xmath130 where we have combined the various uncertainties for form factors presented in last section into the results . as can be observed , the decay rates for the fcnc processes of @xmath131 should be very small , even including the effect from resonances which may enhance the branching ratios considerably , if only the sm applies .",
    "the weak decays of @xmath5 meson may serve as a complementary test of the underlying dynamics , especially the role of the fcnc in weak decays compared with the strong and electromagnetic processes which absolutely dominate the @xmath5 lifetime , even though it is very difficult to be experimentally observed . due to the progress of detection facilities and techniques",
    ", it might be feasible to measure so small branching ratios with relatively clean background and huge database in the future .",
    "of course , if the measurement is feasible , it would be a better platform for determining the ckm entries because of absence of contamination from the spectator",
    ".    moreover , the rare weak decays of @xmath5 may be sensitive to the new physics beyond the standard model . once such weak decays were observed with a sizable branching rate in the future colliders",
    ", it would be a clear signal of new physics effects .    in this work ,",
    "we calculate the weak decay rate of @xmath127 which is realized via fcnc - induced processes in the framework of sm , we find that the rate is too small to be observed in the facilities available at present .",
    "namely , our numerical results show that the branching ratios of such decays are at the order of @xmath132 . in the calculations ,",
    "we have used the qcd sum rules and taken into account possible uncertainties coming from both theoretical and experimental sides . even though the predicted branching ratios are beyond the reach of present facilities which can be seen from a rough order estimate , a more accurate formulation of the three point correlation function derived in this work has theoretical significance and the technique",
