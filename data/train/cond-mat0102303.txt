    "in recent years the second josephson plasma resonance ( jpr ) phenomenon has been studied theoretically and has been observed experimentally@xcite in double layer high tc cuprates .",
    "originally the prediction of a transverse optical josephson resonance and the associated second jpr in layered superconductors with two layers per unit cell appeared as a short conference paper@xcite , explaining briefly the main theoretical ingredients and results .",
    "one of the reasons for revisiting this problem is , that experimentally the transverse optical jpr was observed@xcite in smla@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 with an oscillator strength much smaller than expected on the basis of the simple expression derived in ref . @xcite . following a suggestion by bulaevskii@xcite , the expressions for the dielectric function will be re - derived in this manuscript , while taking into account an extra term representing the finite compressibility of the electron fluid .",
    "the central result is , that the dielectric function is @xmath3 which is the same expression as in ref .",
    "@xcite , except that the volume fractions @xmath4 and @xmath5 have been replaced with _ effective _ weight factors @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which depend on the volume fractions , the plasma frequencies @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and the compressibility .",
    "+ let us consider the optical response function for a material with two superconducting layers per unit cell .",
    "the lattice constant along the c - direction , perpendicular to the planes , is @xmath10 .",
    "the layers are grouped in pairs , with interlayer distances @xmath11 and @xmath12 alternating ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "hence the z - coordinate of the mth plane normalized by the lattice constant is @xmath14 if @xmath15 is even , and @xmath16 if @xmath15 is odd .",
    "+ the charge fluctuation of each plane is characterized by a charge amplitude @xmath17 and a phase @xmath18 , where @xmath15 is the layer index , and @xmath10 is the length of the unit cell along the c - direction .",
    "the discussion in this paper will be restricted to the charge fluctuations perpendicular to the planes , corresponding to a homogeneous charge distribution within each plane . in this case",
    "the electric fields are perpendicular to the planes .",
    "the electric field of a single plane with an area @xmath19 , and charged with positive charge @xmath20 is constant in space , and the field lines are directed away from the plane . as a result the potential energy of a positive test charge with charge @xmath21 in this field _",
    "de_creases linearly as a function of the distance @xmath10 from the plane : @xmath22 . the potential energy stored in the field of the charge fluctuations @xmath17 and @xmath23 of a pair of planes at a distance",
    "@xmath24 is half this amount @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the capacitance of two planes at a distance corresponding to the lattice parameter @xmath10 .",
    "the total potential energy stored in the fields of the charge fluctuations is just the linear superposition of the contributions from all pairs of planes in the crystal . in this context",
    "it is important to point out , that the planes considered here are truly two - dimensional ( 2d ) in the electrodynamical sense : because the charge has no spatial degrees of freedom perpendicular to the planes ( other than tunneling between planes ) , the individual planes provide no channel for metallic screening for fields along the c - axis .",
    "this is quite different from the situation encountered in classical josephson junctions between thick metallic layers . in the latter case",
    "individual planes _",
    "do _ screen the electric fields polarized along the c - direction .",
    "+ the second source of potential energy is the the electronic compressibility .",
    "this is due to the fact that if @xmath27 electrons are added to a plane , the free energy increases with an amount @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are the chemical potential , the electronic compressibility , and the electron density respectively . for a fermi - gas @xmath32 corresponds to density of states at the fermi level . in the context of excitons in two - band superconductors ,",
    "the compressibility term has been first considered in 1966 by leggett@xcite . in neutral fluids",
    "the compressibility causes propagation of sound , whereas for electrons it causes the dispersion of plasmons .",
    "plasma dispersion of the jpr in the cuprates has been described by koyama and tachiki@xcite . in part",
    "the compressibility can be motivated by calculations based on the random phase approximation(rpa ) , showing a finite dispersion of the charge density fluctuations in single layer@xcite and bilayer@xcite cuprates , and of spin , amplitude and phase collective modes@xcite .",
    "it has been shown by artemenko and kobelkov , that the frequency of the resonance , its dispersion and its damping are strongly influenced by the presence of quasi - particles at finite temperature@xcite .",
    "although this type of calculation demonstrates , that the pauli exclusion principle causes a a finite compressibility of the electron fluid , leading to finite dispersion of the collective modes , weak coupling approaches are not well supported due to the strong electronic correlations in these materials .",
    "we thefore treat the electronic compressibility as a phenomenological parameter in this paper .",
    "+ the terms in the free energy proportional to @xmath27 only shift the equilibrium density . in harmonic approximation ,",
    "the charge fluctuations around equilibrium follow from the quadratic terms @xmath33 for later convenience the dimensionless constant @xmath34 , proportional to the 2d bulkmodulus , is introduced here , to characterize the compressibility . in ref .",
    "@xcite we left these terms out of consideration .",
    "+ we calculate the longitudinal dielectric function following the usual procedure of adding external charges @xmath35 to each layer , distributed such as to provide an external electric field @xmath36 ( the displacement field ) of the plane wave form with wavevector @xmath37 .",
    "the _ definition _ of the dielectric constant@xcite implies , that the internal and external charge distributions interact only via the electromagnetic field .",
    "hence , the interaction between internal and external charge is described by the coulomb term , eq .",
    "[ ecoul ] , but the external charge does not enter the compressibility term , eq .",
    "[ compress ] .",
    "the charge dynamics enters via the josephson coupling @xmath38 between each set of nearest neighbor planes @xmath39 our aim is to determine the dielectric constant , and collective modes in the absence of external dc magnetic fields . for this purpose",
    "we will need the equations of motion for the _ internal _ charge accelaration @xmath40 subject to the fields of the internal _ and _ external charges @xmath41 .",
    "these follow from the hamiltonian @xmath42 here the phases @xmath18 and the internal charges @xmath43 are conjugate variables , which are subject to the hamilton - josephson equations of motion : @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the charge of a cooper - pair .",
    "working in the linear response regime , we obtain the equations of motion for the _ internal _ charge accelaration @xmath40 subject to the fields of the internal _ and _ external charges @xmath47|x_n - x_m|      -j_{m}^{m+1}|x_n - x_{m+1}| -j_{m-1}^{m}|x_n - x_{m-1}\\right|\\}q^{t}_n        \\\\       + 2\\gamma_0 ( j_{m}^{m+1}+j_{m-1}^{m})q^i_m - 2\\gamma_0 j_{m}^{m+1}q^i_{m+1 }      - 2\\gamma_0 j_{m-1}^{m}q^i_{m-1 }   \\end{array }                                                  \\label{eom}\\ ] ] due to the lattice periodicity , the solutions have to be plane waves with a wavevector @xmath48 .",
    "therefor we can use generalized charge coordinates @xmath49 , and @xmath50 defined as @xmath51 , @xmath52 , to describe the charge fluctuations in the even and odd planes .",
    "the josephson coupling energies @xmath53 and @xmath54 characterize the two types of junctions . + it is quite easy to extend this to the situation , where we have a lattice polarizability characterized by a dielectric constant @xmath55 and @xmath56 for each type of josephson junction .",
    "this corresponds to the transformation @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 in eqs .",
    "[ hamiltonian ] , and [ eom ] . here",
    "the following definitions have been used : @xmath61 for the average capacitance , @xmath62 for the compressibility , @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( together satisfying @xmath65 ) for the weight factors , and @xmath66 for the average dielectric constant .",
    "we are now ready to formulate the equations of motion for the generalized coordinates @xmath50 and @xmath49 for each wavenumber @xmath48 . @xmath67 the convergent lattice sums over @xmath31 can be replaced with the identities @xmath68 before we continue it is convenient to partly diagonalize eq .",
    "[ eom2 ] , by transforming the expressions to new generalized charge coordinates @xmath20 and @xmath69 , defined as @xmath70 and @xmath71 , with identical transformations for the internal and external charges .",
    "we will see later , that @xmath20 and @xmath69 correspond to charge fluctuations across the barriers of type @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively .",
    "the reverse transformations are @xmath74 , and @xmath75 .",
    "in addition it will turn out to be convenient to introduce the josephson plasma resonance frequencies characteristic of the two types of junctions @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , and the corresponding local charge response functions @xmath78 , and @xmath79 . with the help of the identities eq .",
    "[ defs2 ] the equations of motion of the external and total generalized charge coordinates become @xmath80 we see , that if the compressibility term @xmath81 , these equations of motion are already diagonal , corresponding to two non - dispersing longitudinal plasmons at frequencies @xmath9 and @xmath8 .",
    "it is also immediately clear from this , that @xmath20 , and @xmath69 correspond to the charge fluctuations across junctions of type @xmath72 , and @xmath73 respectively . if @xmath82 is finite , the equations of motion are coupled , and the plasma frequencies will have a finite dispersion as a function of @xmath48 .",
    "we are interested in the response of the total electric field @xmath83 to an external field @xmath36 which is polarized along the c - axis , and which varies harmonically in time and space along the @xmath84-direction , _ i.e. _ @xmath85 the dielectric function @xmath86 is calculated from the definition @xmath87 .",
    "we will employ the fact , that @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 are the total , internal and the external voltages respectively .",
    "thus we need to arrange the external charges in a such a way , as to garantee that the external field @xmath93 has a plane wave form . for @xmath94",
    "coinciding with the coordinates of the conducting planes , this requires that @xmath95 we satisfy this requirement by giving the external charges the ratio @xmath96 . for the generalized",
    "coordinates this implies @xmath97 for the calculation of @xmath98 we need to calculate the macroscopic average of @xmath83 , and @xmath36 , corresponding to the macroscopic electric and displacement fields . for this",
    "it is sufficient to know the voltages at the positions of the planes .",
    "now , using eq .",
    "[ ecoul ] we observe , that the voltages in each plane are @xmath99 we consider a charge oscillation with wavevector @xmath48 .",

    "we conclude from this , that for @xmath106 the dielectric function is @xmath107 from eq.[testb ] we see , that @xmath108 in the limit @xmath106 .",
