    "stimulated brillouin scattering ( sbs ) arises from the interaction of propagating acoustic and optical fields .",
    "in many materials including silicon , brillouin scattering is the strongest optical nonlinearity  @xcite .",
    "these interactions are thereby an opportune mechanism for on - chip nonlinear optical devices compatible with a rapidly growing silicon photonics toolbox  @xcite .",
    "while silicon on insulator ( soi ) is a natural platform for photonics , it is not as well - suited for on - chip phononics and acoustic waveguiding .",
    "the high index contrast between silicon and silica glass readily allows for confinement of optical fields to the silicon device layer . but silicon s relative stiffness  and therefore high sound velocity  makes guiding acoustic waves challenging , motivating the use of soft chalcogenide glasses and partial or complete releases ( removal of the underlying glass ) to co - localize optics and mechanics .",
    "chalcogenide glasses have exhibited the largest brillouin gains , but use of non - standard materials makes integration with silicon foundry processes challenging  @xcite . released and partially released silicon structures , while using standard materials , require highly sensitive post - fabrication processing steps .",
    "furthermore , while release steps minimize mechanical coupling to the environment , they also isolate devices from heat - dissipating thermal linkages and on - chip electronics .",
    "the intuition of `` index - guided '' confinement of mechanical modes fails for sub - wavelength structures . just as a beam",
    "can be made compliant if made thin , thin silicon strips or fins on glass can be made to confine mechanics despite bulksilica s low sound velocity .",
    "this is related to how rayleigh waves are confined to a surface ",
    "free space boundaries affect optics and mechanics in fundamentally different ways . for optics , light propagates",
    "faster in vacuum than in a homogeneous dielectric . in this sense",
    ", the vacuum is `` stiffer '' than the dielectric .",
    "the opposite is the case for acoustic waves ; free space , or free boundaries , softens the structural response , decreasing the phase velocity of guided waves .",
    "as we will show here , by creating a wavelength - scale guided - wave structure with carefully designed free boundaries , we can in principle confine both light and sound in _ unreleased _ silicon on insulator waveguides .",
    "this confinement leads to low loss acoustic waves as well as large optomechanical coupling . in section",
    "[ sec : modes ] we present analysis and simulations showing the existence of low - loss mechanical modes confined to silicon waveguides on a silica slab . in section  [ sec :",
    "interaction ] , we present designs for structures with simultaneously bound , strongly interacting photonic and phononic modes .",
    "these modes exhibit broadband backward brillouin scattering without acoustic radiation into the substrate as well as low - loss , forward brillouin scattering .",
    "these results open the way for a new class of fully cmos compatible silicon photonic devices that utilize mechanical degrees of freedom .",

    "the interaction between propagating light and sound in a translationally invariant waveguide , as shown in figure  [ fig : intro_waveguide ] , is well described by the coupled mode theory of sbs .",
    "the propagating electromagnetic and acoustic waves are described by vector fields @xmath2    respectively .",
    "these waves propagate along @xmath3 as shown in figure  [ fig : intro_waveguide ] . the envelope functions @xmath4 and",
    "@xmath5 capture slow variations of the amplitude of the modes such that @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "for there to be significant interactions both energy and momentum must be conserved .",
    "consider an incoming optical mode of frequency @xmath8 and a mechanical mode of frequency @xmath9 .",
    "these modes can scatter into a downshifted optical _ stokes wave _ with frequency @xmath10 or an upshifted _ anti - stokes wave _ with frequency @xmath11 .",
    "momentum conservation , or spatial phase - matching , for the stokes process demands @xmath12 .",
    "the process is commonly referred to as _ backward _ and _ forward _ sbs  @xcite ( bsbs and fsbs ) in the case of counter- and co - propagating optical modes , respectively .",
    "additionally sound can scatter light between different modes of a waveguide , referred to as intermodal sbs or stimulated inter - polarization scattering ( sips )  @xcite , which we do not consider here .",
    "these conservation laws are reflected in the dynamics of the envelope functions as described by the coupled mode equations  @xcite    @xmath13    where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are the group velocities of the pump , stokes , and mechanical wave , @xmath17 is the attenuation constant for acoustic waves , @xmath18 is the phase mismatch @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the optomechanical coupling .",
    "these relations hold so long as the envelope functions vary slowly relative to @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( or @xmath23 and @xmath9 for mechanics ) . assuming the interaction is weak enough such that @xmath24 is nearly constant over the mechanical attenuation length @xmath25 , the mechanics mediates an effectively local interaction between the optical modes and equations  ( [ eq : cme1])-([eq : cme3 ] )",
    "can be solved for the steady - state dynamics of the optical fields : @xmath26 the brillouin gain parameter ( 2re\\ { .. } ) appearing in these equations depends on the normalization of the mode amplitudes . for the rest of this paper , we assume power normalization such that the calculated gain , @xmath27 , has units @xmath28 and is given by  @xcite @xmath29 with modal powers @xmath30 .",
    "silicon s transverse sound speed @xmath31 is much higher than in glass where @xmath32 .",
    "the material properties @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are young s modulus , density , and poisson s ratio , respectively .",
    "vibrations of a silicon waveguide with phase velocities above @xmath36 will readily excite surface and bulk waves of the glass substrate . despite a relatively high material stiffness , high aspect - ratio silicon structures , as in figure  [ fig : modes ] ,",
    "can have _ geometrically softened _ modes with lower phase velocities than bulk and surface acoustic waves in glass .",
    "we focus on strip waveguides in 340  nm thick soi .",
    "consider the vibrations of a 100  nm wide strip waveguide . to simplify the analysis",
    "we first replace the glass substrate with fixed boundary conditions .",
    "solutions to the equations of elasticity are computed numerically in comsol  @xcite for each wavevector @xmath23 by imposing floquet boundary conditions on faces perpendicular to the axis of propagation . a representative mechanical mode and the dispersion of the clamped beam",
    "is shown ( dashed ) in figure  [ fig : modes]a . at @xmath37 solutions",
    "reduce to the those of a cantilever for which @xcite @xmath38 here @xmath39 is the bending moment of the beam , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the beam height and width , and @xmath42 the area of the profile .",
    "we model silicon as an isotropic material with properties @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "as @xmath23 is increased the rectangular waveguide exhibits quadratic dispersion which is sensitive to @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "waveguide geometry becomes insignificant in the high-@xmath23 limit where the mechanical wavelength is small compared to @xmath41 and @xmath40 . in this limit",
    "the phase velocity limits to @xmath46 governed only by bulk material properties .    we now consider strip waveguides on glass . the spectrum for this structure , as shown in figure  [ fig : modes]a ,",
    "is comprised of flexural modes of the beam ( the solid line falling below the dashed clamped beam disperison discussed above ) , and surface waves at the glass - air interface ( the hatched region ) as well as bulk waves in the glass ( also within the hatched region ) .",
    "notably for @xmath0 , a broad interval of the flexural band lies below the dispersion of the surface acoustic waves described by the _ rayleigh cone _ with phase velocity @xmath47",
    ".    scattering from this interval into the rayleigh waves is forbidden by phase - matching considerations . here",
    "the rayleigh wave velocity @xmath48 is related to the material properties of glass by the rayleigh - lamb equations .",
    "modeling the glass with material parameters @xmath49 , we find @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "the rayleigh waves travel slower than longitudinal ( @xmath51 ) and transverse ( @xmath52 ) waves in glass .",
    "the bulk waves in glass , also in the hatched region , lie above the rayleigh line .",
    "as the width of a rectangular waveguide is increased , the flexural band rises in frequency . at @xmath53 ,",
    "the band lies completely above the rayleigh line and no protected region is present .",
    "owing to the scale invariance of the equations of elasticity and the dispersion of acoustic waves , this characteristic aspect ratio 250:340 depends only upon material properties of the device and substrate layer and is therefore relevant to unreleased soi devices of any thickness .",
    "for example , for 220 nm soi , waveguides of width smaller than 160 nm are required to achieve non - leaky or phase - protected propagation .",
    "the symmetry of strip waveguides leads to symmetries of the mode profiles , suppressing any intermodal brillouin scattering via the acoustic waves studied above . under reflection through the @xmath54 symmetry plane , @xmath55",
    ", the mechanical modes are either symmetric ( @xmath56 ) or antisymmetric ( @xmath57 ) , _ i.e. _ , @xmath58 .",
    "the interaction rate in equation  ( [ eq : brillouingain_bsbs ] ) is linear in the displacement field and both optical fields . for intramodal scattering , since both optical modes are of the same symmetry , the interaction is nonzero only if the mechanical motion , @xmath59 , is symmetric under @xmath55 . as the flexural modes shown in figure  [ fig : modes]a",
    "are antisymmetric , they can not mediate intramodal scattering .",
    "in contrast , the symmetric mechanical supermode of side - by - side strip waveguides , _",
    "i.e. _ , a slot waveguide , can mediate intramodal scattering .",
    "tight confinement of the strip waveguide flexural modes inside the silicon causes the symmetric and antisymmetric supermodes of the slot structure to be nearly degenerate even at spacings below 100 nm , since very little acoustic coupling occurs through the glass .",
    "the splitting is therefore negligibly small on the scale of figure  [ fig : modes]a , and is not visible .",
    "the slot waveguide is a popular photonic structure .",
    "the te - like modes of slot waveguides are commonly used for sensing as electric field amplitudes are large in the gap  @xcite .",
    "a recent study of sbs in chalcogenide glasses filling a slot waveguide has utilized this electric field enhancement to achieve large interactions with index - guided mechanical modes  @xcite .",
    "slot waveguides have also been proposed for sbs in suspended silicon structures  @xcite . furthermore slotted structures have been implemented in photonic crystal fibers  @xcite to achieve large optomechanical coupling .",
    "consider the optical guided modes for @xmath60 wide strips spaced @xmath61 apart in @xmath62 thick silicon shown in figure  [ fig : modes]b .",
    "for these dimensions , the waveguide has a single , tm - like mode in the telecom c - band .",
    "the large splitting of the fundamental te - like and tm - like modes of this waveguide is a consequence of the high aspect ratio necessary to confine mechanics .",
    "additionally , we expect that by using tm guided modes , lower scattering due to smaller fields at etched surfaces will lead to lower optical losses .",
    "( * c. * ) .",
    "the radiation pressure ( boundary ) contribution to the optomechanical coupling is an order of magnitude larger than the photoelastic effect ( body ) , plotted inset to * c. * on separate scales for clarity . *",
    "d. * the peak fsbs gain is shown alongside the 873  mhz , @xmath37 mechanical mode .",
    "fsbs peak gains are @xmath63 greater than bsbs gains , largely a consequence of lower mechanical frequency .",
    "we assume a mechanical quality factor of @xmath64 in all calculations . ]",
    "having defined the acoustic and optical modes of interest , we now calculate the achievable brillouin gains using equation  ( [ eq : brillouingain_bsbs ] ) .",
    "the displacement field causes a perturbation in the permittivity @xmath65 with a bulk contribution from the photoelastic effect @xmath66 and a boundary contribution from radiation pressure @xmath67 . for isotropic materials like silicon and glass , @xmath68 .",
    "the rank-2 photoelastic tensor @xmath69 relates the strain @xmath70 to a change in @xmath71  @xcite .",
    "this term is integrated over the bulk of each dielectric .",
    "a second contribution due to motion of the boundaries of the dielectrics takes the form of an integral over these surfaces with integrand  @xcite @xmath72 with the electric field perpendicular @xmath73 and electric displacement field parallel @xmath74 to the normal of each boundary .",
    "the permittivity differences @xmath75 and @xmath76 are taken from outside to inside in the direction of the normal @xmath77 .",
    "although in general both effects are significant in wavelength - scale waveguides  @xcite , radiation pressure at the silicon - air boundary is an order of magnitude greater than all other bulk and boundary contributions for the slot waveguides considered and the values of @xmath27 calculated here .    as the detuning @xmath78 in equation  ( [ eq : brillouingain_bsbs ] )",
    "is varied , @xmath27 sweeps out a lorentzian with fwhm @xmath17 and height equal to the _ peak _ , or _",
    "phase - matched _",
    ", _ brillouin gain _ @xmath79 . for each optical wave vector @xmath21 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : interaction]a ) and corresponding resonant mechanical wave @xmath80 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : interaction]b ) , we compute the phase - matched brillouin gain for bsbs ( fig .  [",
    "fig : interaction]c ) .",
    "this gain @xmath81 increases steadily from zero at @xmath82 before turning over approximately where the flexural mode enters the rayleigh cone .",
    "in addition , we sweep the geometry and see in figure  [ fig : geom_sweep ] that @xmath83 increases with decreasing @xmath41 and @xmath84 .    as discussed in section  [ sec : symmetryandoptics ] , the antisymmetry of the flexural modes of a rectangular waveguide motivates the use of symmetric supermodes of the slot waveguide for intramodal sbs . in figure[fig : interaction]c , a plot of the photoelastic and radiation pressure distributions show the drawbacks of the inherent asymmetry of the flexural modes .",
    "these distributions are roughly antisymmetric about the @xmath54 symmetry plane of each waveguide , cancelling in an optical field of constant intensity . despite these cancellations ,",
    "we obtain peak bsbs gains approaching 600  @xmath28 that are comparable to silicon - based demonstrations .",
    "( labeled in nanometers ) for fixed gap @xmath1 , left , and different gaps @xmath84 ( labeled in nanometers ) for fixed width @xmath0 , right . ]    for bsbs a large interval of the mechanical band is forbidden from radiating into the glass by phase - matching considerations .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath37 mechanical mode radiates into surface acoustic waves and bulk acoustic modes of the glass . due to impedance mismatch , these loss channels do not necessarily prohibit the use of slot waveguides for fsbs .",
    "simulations of a @xmath0 , @xmath1 slot waveguide show that acoustic radiation limits the quality factor to @xmath85 .",
    "the 873  mhz mechanical resonance at @xmath37 radiates into glass modes at a rate of @xmath86 .",
    "current demonstrations of released , on - chip systems exhibit mechanical quality factors below this radiative limit @xcite .",
    "since the modal power is not well defined around @xmath37 , we express equation([eq : brillouingain_bsbs ] ) for fsbs on resonance as @xmath87 and use this to compute the @xmath81 curve in figure  [ fig : interaction]d .",
    "the resulting peak brillouin gain is two orders of magnitude larger than corresponding values for bsbs in agreement with the @xmath88 scaling of @xmath27 from the mechanical mode energy normalization in equation  ( [ eq : brillouingain_fsbs ] ) .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to make waveguides that simultaneously guide interacting acoustic and optical waves in the technologically important silicon on insulator platform and presented a design for optically single - moded , brillouin active waveguides in 340  nm soi .",
    "these results open a significant new space of design freedom  the incorporation of nanomechanics and acoustics in cmos compatible photonic architectures , which can have applications in optical , rf - microwave , as well as novel sensing circuits ."
