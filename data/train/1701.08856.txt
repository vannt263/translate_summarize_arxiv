    "the entanglement entropy of a region @xmath5 is given by the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix produced by tracing over all degrees of freedom in the complement @xmath6 .",
    "this quantity provides a measure of the entanglement of the two regions and has been utilized in a wide variety of areas ranging from quantum information theory to black hole physics .    in the present paper",
    "we are interested in entanglement entropy in two dimensional conformal field theories , studied first in @xcite . for a spatial region given by a finite interval of length @xmath7 and an uv cutoff @xmath8 , the entanglement entropy of this interval has the following form @xmath9 the logarithmically divergent term is universal and only depends on the central charge @xmath10 of the cft . on the other hand",
    "the constant @xmath11 is in general regulator dependent and not universal .    for a cft with a boundary , defect or interface",
    "it was argued in @xcite that the constant term @xmath11 becomes physically meaningful and is closely related to the boundary entropy first introduced in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will only consider conformal interfaces and there are two cases which one can distinguish .",
    "first , we consider an interval placed symmetrically across an interface @xmath12 between two cfts of the same central charge , whose entanglement entropy is @xmath13 where now the constant term @xmath14 is a function of the parameters of the interface @xmath12 .",
    "the universal term has the same form between ( [ basicee ] ) and ( [ symee ] ) as the endpoints of the interval where entanglement is strongest are symmetrically positioned away from the location of the interface .",
    "second , we can locate the interface at the boundary of the region @xmath5 and enlarge it to cover the whole of one of the two cfts in the limit as @xmath7 becomes very large , so that the end - point of the interval is fixed to the location of the interface .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the central charge @xmath10 for universal term gets replaced by a function of the parameters of the interface @xmath15 the function @xmath16 varies depending on the cft and is known only for a few cases , two of which are reviewed in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "however , in general @xmath16 must obey some limits .",
    "for an interface that completely decouples the two cfts it must be the case that @xmath17 , while for an interface that completely transmits energy ( so - called topological interfaces ) it must be the case that @xmath18 instead of @xmath19 has to do with the fact that we are now considering an semi - infinite entangling interval with only one end - point , and thus should have half the entropy of the two end - point case in ( [ basicee ] ) . ] .",
    "a natural generalization of an interface @xmath12 connecting two cfts is a junction @xmath20 connecting @xmath0 cfts along a common line .",
    "if we consider an entangling region containing one of the cfts , say cft@xmath21 , then the entanglement entropy has the same generic form as ( [ asym2ee ] ) ; that is , @xmath22 for junctions between non - relativistic theories , it was shown in @xcite that the universal term of ( [ asymnee ] ) is related to the universal term of ( [ asym2ee ] ) via @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the total transmission coefficient from @xmath25-th theory to the other theories in the junction , however this has not been shown to hold in the conformal setting .",
    "in this work we will show that this relationship holds for arbitrary junctions between cfts which are constructed from free conformal bosons and fermions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we review the folding trick which turns the problem of constructing conformal interfaces into one of constructing boundary states .",
    "we review the construction of bosonic as well as fermionic boundary states and determine the normalization using the cardy condition .",
    "in section [ sec3 ] we review the calculation of entanglement entropy in the presence of a bosonic and fermionic interface which is located at the boundary of the entangling space . in section [ sec4 ] we calculate the entanglement entropy of bosonic and fermionic @xmath0-junctions , generalizing the method introduced in the previous section . in section [ sec5 ]",
    "we construct all boundary states corresponding to @xmath26-junctions and discuss various features and limits . in section [ sec6 ]",
    "we summarize the main results of our work and discuss possible avenues for future work involving cft junctions .",
    "our conventions for the free boson and fermion cfts , special functions as well as calculational details involving gaussian integrals and circular determinants are relegated to appendices .",
    "a conformally invariant interface between general cft@xmath27 and cft@xmath28 is described by an operator located at the interface that satisfies @xmath29 for @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 with @xmath33 are the virasoro generators of each cft .",
    "finding operators that satisfy ( [ intcond ] ) can be mapped to finding conformal boundary states satisfying @xmath34 by use of a parity transformation .",
    "this is the content of the folding trick @xcite , which is illustrated in figure [ intfoldfig ] . for general cfts ,",
    "the boundary states satisfying ( [ virasorobndcond ] ) are often difficult to find .",
    "when @xmath35 the cft are rational an for a finite number of primary fields all solutions to ( [ virasorobndcond ] ) have been found @xcite and organized into modular invariant boundary states @xcite .",
    "however , since we are considering an @xmath0-times tensor product cft in the folded picture ( @xmath2 for interfaces , @xmath3 for junctions ) , the resulting folded cft always has @xmath36 and hence not rational .",
    "if one imposes additional conditions such as preservation of a current algebra or permutation symmetry , more general constructions of boundary states and interfaces are possible @xcite . another possibility is given by strengthening the conditions ( [ virasorobndcond ] ) to boundary states satisfying @xmath37 for each @xmath33 separately",
    "this leads to so called topological defects or interfaces @xcite . in this case solutions",
    "are known for wider classes of cfts ; e.g. for topological interfaces in rational cfts the corresponding interface operators were found in @xcite and @xcite by building off of the modular invariant projection operators constructed in @xcite .",
    "when considering free fields , as in this work , the conditions can be written in terms of the creation and annihilation operators and can be solved by a coherent state anzatz .",
    "we will now show how this works for free bosonic interfaces and junctions .     and",
    "cft@xmath28 to the tensor product cft@xmath38 with boundary .",
    "the folded picture is useful for characterizing classes of interfaces and some simple calculations ( see @xcite ) . for calculations such as ours",
    "the boundary states need to be unfolded once they are found.[intfoldfig ] ]      under the replacement @xmath39 for a @xmath40 matrix @xmath41 , the operator combinations in the generators @xmath42 are altered as @xmath43 considering summation over the index @xmath25 in the above and form of the generators ( [ bosenvir ] ) , it is seen that @xmath44 if @xmath41 is an orthogonal matrix",
    ". thus , the conformal condition ( [ virasorobndcond ] ) simplifies to @xmath45 for @xmath41 an element of @xmath46 .",
    "this condition can also be constructed explicitly for free fields by requiring continuity of the stress tensor at the location of the interface @xcite .",
    "these new conditions ( [ bosebndcon ] ) can be solved by a coherent state anzatz @xmath47 ) describes a d - brane in the boundary state formalism ( see @xcite for review ) , and this correspondence is used to find and classify all the possible boundary states for the two scalar model .",
    "the d - brane interpretation also gives us physical meaning for the normalization , the so called @xmath48-factor , and the ground state @xmath49 in ( [ coheranzatz ] ) .",
    "the one - dimensional special case of ( [ bosebndcon ] ) emits the unit scalar choices @xmath50 , which correspond to the two possible d - brane states for a single compact scalar @xmath51 and @xmath52 are position and dual wilson line moduli of the d - brane . for an interface between two @xmath53 cfts",
    "the d - brane states of the two scalar model are needed .",
    "these were constructed in @xcite using rotations and t - duality transformations on the tensor products of ( [ bosed0 ] ) and ( [ bosed1 ] ) .",
    "the first class of states are the rotations of @xmath54 by an arbitrary angle in the compactification lattice parametrized by two integers @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xmath57 as shown in figure [ d1fig ] .",
    "the explicit boundary state is given by    .",
    "on the left : a d1-brane wrapping the bosonic 2-torus ( corresponding to the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) shown in the unit cell of the compactification lattice.[d1fig ] ]    @xmath60 and latexmath:[\\[\\label{d1thetazm }    the other class of states , corresponding to bound states between @xmath56 d2-branes and @xmath55 d0-branes , is obtained from ( [ d1theta ] ) through a t - duality transformation ( [ tdualrules ] ) of @xmath62 .",

    "the normalization factors in the previous boundary states are determined by cardy s condition , which we will explain for a general bosonic d - brane state in the next section .          for junctions connecting @xmath3 free boson cfts ,",
    "we proceed with the same folding methods shown in figure [ intfoldfig ] applied repeatedly , as illustrated in figure [ juncfoldfig ] .",
    "specifically , the bosonic @xmath0-junction is folded into the @xmath0-times tensor product cft with boundary states @xmath68 determined by the boundary condition @xmath69 where now @xmath41 is an element of @xmath70 ) or by requiring continuity of the stress tensor at the location of the junction @xcite . ] .",
    "as before , ( [ nbndcond ] ) is solved by a coherent state of the form @xmath71 is an @xmath0-dimensional sublattice of the full @xmath72-dimensional lattice of unconstrained eigenvalues of the @xmath73 and @xmath74 . not",
    "every element of @xmath70 will be compatible with the zero mode structure , i.e. satisfy the @xmath75 case of ( [ nbndcond ] ) for the quantized eigenvalues ( [ zmeigen ] ) , and thus the bosonic boundary states correspond to a countable subset of @xmath70 . for @xmath2 the restrictions ( [ 2boseangle ] ) and ( [ 2boseangle2 ] ) specify the allowed subset of @xmath46 , and in section [ sec5 ] we find the allowed subset of @xmath76 for @xmath4 .",
    "lastly , the phases @xmath77 are related to the position and dual wilson line moduli of the d - brane , but as they will vanish from all our calculations we will not characterize them further .",
    "we now fix the normalization through cardy s condition for this general bosonic d - brane .",
    "cardy s condition enforces the consistency between the open and closed string channels ; that is , it requires the annulus amplitude to have a modular interpretation as a partition function on the cylinder .",
    "we will use this condition to fix the value of the normalization factor in ( [ nbosbstate ] ) .",
    "let @xmath78 for some @xmath79 .",
    "the annulus amplitude is then @xmath80 the quadratic operator exponentials in the boundary state complicate attempts at direct calculation ; instead we linearize the exponential by means of gaussian integrals of the form @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are @xmath0-dimensional vectors whose entries are all mutually commuting operators . linearizing each of the exponentials in ( [ annamp ] ) with ( [ boslinint ] ) in a complementary fashion we obtain the expression @xmath84 where @xmath49 is the lattice - summed zero mode in ( [ nbosbstate ] ) and we have used the identities @xmath85 the form of ( [ annamplin ] ) is such that the zero mode contribution , the first line of ( [ annamplin ] ) , is isolated from the remaining oscillator contribution . the zero mode contribution is a lattice theta function ( see appendix [ thetas ] ) @xmath86 where the dependence on the phases in @xmath49 have vanished . for the oscillator integrals , we commute the two linear operator exponentials in the third line of ( [ annamplin ] ) to obtain @xmath87^{-n}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the dependence on @xmath41 is removed after the @xmath88 , @xmath89 integration due to the fact that @xmath90 as @xmath41 is an element of @xmath70 . comparing this result to ( [ dedetadef ] )",
    "we find that the annulus amplitude can be written in closed form as @xmath91^{-n}\\ ] ] performing @xmath41-transformations on the above we have the equivalent expression @xmath92^{-n}\\ ] ] in order for ( [ ncylpar ] ) to correspond to a cylinder partition function with a properly normalized vacuum we must have that the constant term as @xmath93 in ( [ ncylpar ] ) is unity .",
    "thus , cardy s condition fixes @xmath94      owing to their much less complicated zero mode structure , the boundary states corresponding to interfaces and junctions between free fermion cfts have a simpler construction and can be expressed entirely in terms of an arbitrary element of @xmath70 .",
    "the fermionic analog to ( [ bosebndcon ] ) is @xmath95 in contrast to ( [ bosed0 ] ) and ( [ bosed1 ] ) the single fermion has the four possible boundary states @xmath96 and the different modings in the neveu - schwarz and ramond sectors .",
    "each of these boundary states are normalized via cardy s condition as in the bosonic case . in @xcite",
    "the various fermionic boundary states for @xmath2 were found ; here we give their straightforward generalization to arbitrary @xmath0 for the neveu - schwarz sector @xmath97 and @xmath98 is an anti - symmetric matrix given by @xmath99 the state in ( [ nfermrbstate ] ) is only well defined as long as @xmath100 is in the connected component of @xmath70 . thus we take the matrix @xmath100 to be the pure rotation part of @xmath41 , i.e. we write @xmath41 as an elementary reflection composed with a continuous rotation @xmath100 .",
    "the reflection content of @xmath41 is then represented in the ground state through the choice of signs in the @xmath101 .",
    "if @xmath41 is a pure rotation then @xmath102 for all @xmath25 , whereas if @xmath41 includes a reflection then @xmath103 for all @xmath25 excepting the two indices corresponding to the plane of reflection .",
    "these considerations ensure that ( [ nfermrbstate ] ) satisfies the zero mode boundary condition @xmath104 while maintaining a finite normalization .      in @xcite and",
    "@xcite it was shown that the physical quantity determining the universal term in the entanglement entropy for both the bosonic and fermionic interfaces is the transmission coefficient of the interface .",
    "this continues to be the case for @xmath3 , so therefore we briefly review these coefficients for interfaces and junctions of free boson and free fermion cfts .    the reflection and transmission coefficients for cft @xmath0-junctions are related to the @xmath105 matrix @xmath106 where @xmath68 is the boundary state corresponding to the junction .",
    "this matrix was first considered for interfaces in @xcite where average reflection and transmission coefficients were found @xmath107 which are enough to characterize transport processes for @xmath2 since in this case @xmath108 is a symmetric matrix .",
    "these coefficients were generalized in @xcite to the case @xmath109 @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the reflection coefficient for cft@xmath21 and @xmath112 is the transmission coefficient for transport from cft@xmath21 to cft@xmath113 .",
    "it should be noted for @xmath2 that ( [ reftransn ] ) is related to ( [ reftrans2 ] ) by @xmath114 so that for @xmath115 the three different transmissions all agree .",
    "for @xmath3 we ll also want to consider the total transmission from cft@xmath21 , given by the sum @xmath116 in both the free boson and free fermion cases ( [ nbosbstate ] ) and ( [ nfermbstate ] ) , the reflection and transmission coefficients of these boundary states are given by @xmath117 and thus the coefficients can be lifted from the matrix @xmath41 , e.g. the angled d1-brane with matrix ( [ d1s ] ) has a transmission coefficient @xmath118    it is interesting to note that a completely transmissive junction , which necessarily has @xmath119 for all @xmath120 , has its transmission coefficients constrained to be @xmath121 where @xmath122 , the index @xmath123 is identified with 1 , and @xmath124 .",
    "these correspond to twisted permutation junctions whose boundary states satisfy @xmath125 for ( [ nbosbstate ] ) and @xmath126 for ( [ nfermbstate ] ) with independent sign choices for each @xmath25 , of which there are @xmath127 distinct matrices @xmath41 .",
    "here we review the entanglement entropy calculations of @xcite and @xcite for interfaces between free boson and free fermion cfts .",
    "we choose to first highlight the bosonic calculation as it will be the one most readily generalizable to arbitrary @xmath0 . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "the starting point for characterizing an interface was to consider the corresponding boundary state in the folded picture .",
    "once the boundary state is obtained the folded cft must then be unfolded to produce the interface operator satisfying ( [ intcond ] ) that is needed for the calculation .",
    "the bosonic boundary states in ( [ d1theta ] ) and ( [ 2d2d0 ] ) are unfolded into operators via what is essentially a parity transformation on the quantities of one of the cfts @xcite @xmath128 for the state ( [ d1theta ] ) produces the interface operator @xmath129\\right\\}\\ ] ] where the ground state operator given by @xmath130 the expression for the interface operator in ( [ boseintop ] ) is a formal one , as the negatively - moded oscillators must be placed on the left side of the ground state operator after the full expansion of the exponential .",
