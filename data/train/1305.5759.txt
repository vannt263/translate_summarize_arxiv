    "ostrogradsky introduced the idea of higher derivative lagrangians in classical mechanics @xcite , and there is a series of articles published about this topic , see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "however , to my knowledge , there is no article dealing with relativistic higher derivative lagrangians of this type : @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the @xmath12-derivatives of the position ( @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the proper time ) , and @xmath15 are the generalized vectorial fields coupling linearly with the @xmath12-derivatives .",
    "here we denote the field @xmath16 to refer to the electromagnetic potential .",
    "also we denote @xmath17 because of the analogy with the geodesic equations that we will see in the equation ( [ eqgeodesique ] ) . from ( [ l ] ) , we set the action : @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "we will not give an explicit general dynamic theory for a given @xmath12 , we consider only @xmath20 for the moment and we will discuss the general case later .",
    "an integration by part for @xmath20 gives the equivalent action @xcite : @xmath21 and one can see that the first part of the action @xmath22 is similar to the electrodynamic action whereas the second part is similar to the gravitational action .",
    "indeed , from the generalized euler - lagrange equations ( see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) : @xmath23 with @xmath24 , we get : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are : @xmath28 and where @xmath29 .",
    "one sees the analogy with the equations of the motion of a charged particle in a gravitational field and in an electromagnetic field .",
    "however , the fixed metric ( or _ background _ metric ) is minkowskian .",
    "then , the quadrivector field @xmath9 can be seen as a _ displacement vector field _ and @xmath26 can be viewed as an infinitesimal strain tensor by analogy with the deformation theory of a continuous medium @xcite .",
    "now , let us take @xmath30 , we denote @xmath31",
    ". from @xmath32 one has : @xmath33 where @xmath34 we can see that this field generalizes the idea of the electromagnetic field because of the antisymmetry of @xmath35 .",
    "however , in ( [ eqgeodesique3 ] ) there are some other fields , similar to @xmath27 , coupling with the combinations of the odd derivatives of @xmath36 , i.e. @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we can also discuss the higher derivative terms .",
    "for @xmath39 , we denote the field @xmath40 .",
    "the dynamic equations have a similar structure to the one we get for @xmath9 ( i.e. for @xmath20 ) . as it has been shown that in the non - relativistic theory @xcite , we notice that the lagrangian @xmath41 is equivalent to this lagrangian @xmath42 and the quantity @xmath43 could be interpreted as a more _ general kinetic energy _",
    "@xcite . here",
    "the problem is similar : the lagrangian @xmath3 is equivalent to @xmath44 and so is obviously more complicated than the equivalent lagrangian that we get for the special case @xmath45 .    to finish this section ,",
    "let us now consider the generalized fields @xmath46 . by the generalized euler - lagrange equations",
    ": @xmath47 we get terms of the form @xmath48 multiplied by the combination of the derivatives @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "one can see that the `` even '' @xmath12-fields are analogous to the `` gravitational field '' as the `` odd '' @xmath12-fields are to the `` electromagnetic field '' , since , in the dynamic equations , the derivatives @xmath51 are multiplied by the symmetric ( if @xmath12 is even ) / antisymmetric ( if @xmath12 is odd ) part of the first derivative of the field : @xmath52 here we denote the @xmath12-field by @xmath53 .",
    "we will see the consequences of this remark in the next section .",
    "the point is to relate the possible existence of these fields with a generalized induction phenomenon .",
    "we will suppose that there exists new physical couplings with _ higher currents _ , yet unkown , and we will generalize the electromagnetic field theory .      in the lagrangian ( [ l ] ) for @xmath20 we notice that the field @xmath54 is coupled with the acceleration of the particle as the field @xmath55 is coupled with the velocity of the particle .",
    "by analogy with the construction of the electromagnetic field theory , we suggest the following field equations : @xmath56 where the acceleration current density @xmath57 ( generally non - conserved ) is : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the density of particles and @xmath60 is the 4-acceleration .",
    "let us rewrite the coupling constant @xmath61 as follows @xmath62 where @xmath63 has the dimension of a length .    to complete the system of field equations ,",
    "we need ten equations : @xmath64 the equations ( [ gpe1 ] ) are analogous to the compatibility equations for the strain tensor in the three - dimensional non - relativistic theory of deformation of continuous media @xcite .",
    "hence we get the following wave equations : @xmath65 with @xmath66 .",
    "also , the trace of @xmath26 follows this equation @xmath67 this means that @xmath68 is a non - massive scalar field . in the linear theory of the deformation of a continuous medium",
    ", the trace of the strain tensor is interpreted as the contraction / dilation of the volume @xcite .",
    "here we observe a similar property and by the equation ( [ tracen2 ] ) we conclude that the relativistic deformation of the volume of the _ four dimensional continuous medium _ is related to the non - conservation of the current @xmath69 .      with respect to the analogy that we have already discussed above between the even fields and the gravitational field and between the odd fields with the electromagnetic field and using the field theory developed for the case @xmath20 , we can construct the general field theory via a more general induction principle . following this rule ,",
    "we rewrite the constants in ( [ l ] ) as @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are fundamental length constants and @xmath74 is the gravitational constant .",
    "it comes naturally that for so - called _ gravitational type fields _",
    "@xmath75 , the coupling has the form : @xmath76 whereas for the so - called _ electromagnetic type fields _",
    "@xmath77 , the coupling has the form : @xmath78 where @xmath79 has the dimension of @xmath80 ( @xmath81 is the newton and @xmath82 the ampre ) , @xmath83 is the vacuum permeability ( @xmath84 ) , and where @xmath85 has the dimension of a length .",
    "the generalized currents for @xmath86 are constructed as follows : @xmath87 where @xmath59 is the mass density and @xmath88 the electric charge density .",
    "similar to ( [ gpe2 ] ) , we construct an @xmath89-order linear differential theory to relate the sources and the fields : @xmath90 and @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are two @xmath89-order differential operators and where @xmath94 and @xmath95 .    from those rules",
    "we could obtain similar wave equations to ( [ propachampsphys0 ] ) and ( [ tracen2 ] ) but with a higher order differential operator @xmath96 .",
    "for example , for the @xmath97-field we can take @xmath98 and then we get the wave equation for the trace of the tensor @xmath99 : @xmath100 and then @xmath101 is a massive scalar field .",
    "notice that for the electromagnetic type fields , the choice of the fields @xmath79 ( due to the antisymmetry of the fields @xmath102 ) is not unique whereas for the gravitational type fields all of the components of the fields @xmath85 are physical .",
    "this project is at an early stage and the construction of these operators @xmath103 and @xmath104 has to be understood , even for @xmath20 .      physically , we can understand the _",
    "generalized vectorial fields theory _ as perturbative corrections of the first order theory ( i.e. @xmath105 is a correction of the minkowskian theory of electromagnetism field @xmath106 ) .",
    "therefore , it is natural to unify the gravity type fields as well as the electromagnetic type fields",
    ". then , we construct the dimensionless unification constants : @xmath107 where the constants @xmath108 and @xmath109 , were introduced in section ii.b .",
    "for example , if we suppose that @xmath110 , we get the coupling : @xmath111 where we put @xmath112 ( remind that @xmath113 and @xmath114 ) .",
    "phenomenologically , this means that for an electric circuit with an intensity of this type @xmath115 , where @xmath14 is a time constant , the third derivative of the electrons in the current is non - zero ( this kinematic quantity is called the _ jerk _ , see @xcite ) and so that the electromagnetic field would be modified by the _ jerk current _",
    "we mention that in the generalized theory of electrodynamics @xcite the relation with the higher derivatives currents has not been suggested .",
    "similarly , we can construct the unified coupling for the even fields .",
    "for example , if we suppose that @xmath117 , we can reconstruct the unified coupling for @xmath118 in the following way : @xmath119 where we put @xmath120 and where we introduce the effective current @xmath121 .",
    "so the effective deformation @xmath122 to the minkowski metric is also induced by the second derivative of the acceleration of the particles moving in the space .",
    "* microscopic physics and generalized currents    the effect of gravitation at the microscopic scale is not yet well known .",
    "we wonder if the current @xmath69 of the acceleration of masses will be significant .",
    "there is no current proof that gravitation can be viewed as a metric field at this scale .",
    "it might also be a challenge to see whether the higher derivative fields play a role in particle physics .",
    "we gave the interpretation of the @xmath123-fields ( ex @xmath54 and @xmath124 ) and between the @xmath89-fields ( ex @xmath125 and @xmath126 ) as the generalisation of the gravitational and electromagnetic field for higher currents .",
    "hence , formulating a perturbative quantum field theory including these fields is an open question .",
    "@xmath127 +      after introducing the higher derivative fields and the higher currents , we naturally wonder if it is possible to extend the lorentzian kinematic theory to a more general inertial concept where the higher derivatives of the quadri vector position appear in the free lagrangian .",
    "for example , following the discussion in section i , we propose the following lagrangian : @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the mass of the particle , @xmath63 is a universal constant and @xmath130 . for this model the free motion",
    "is not determined by @xmath131 but by the equations : @xmath132 independently to the mass of the particle .",
    "we question whether the model ( [ lolambda ] ) is consistent with the special theory of relativity .",
    "one problem concerns the simultaneity .",
    "consider an observer in an inertial reference frame , i.e. @xmath133 . if we imagine that a photon is emitted from an accelerated massive particle ( the equation of motion are given by ( [ lolambda ] ) with the initial conditions @xmath134 and @xmath135 ) , is the photon accelerated with respect to the inertial reference frame observing the motion of the particle or does its velocity remain constant and equal to @xmath136 ? behind this question is a more fundamental problem of the equivalence between the accelerated reference frames .",
    "this requires further study .",
    "@xmath127 +      we will discuss only the @xmath20-field model of the section ii.a and we consider @xmath137 . in a future project , it will be interesting , as a first step , to formulate the @xmath54-field theory as a perturbative gravitational field arising from the metric field and to then to look at the possible effects for particle physics and/or cosmology",
    ".    we will give here the idea to construct the covariant strain / stress field theory .",
    "let us consider the covariant derivative for a riemannian metric space @xmath138 .",
    "now , we construct a stress tensor @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the density of energy constant , and analogous to the young modulus for an isotropic medium @xcite .",
    "the stress tensor could be added to the einstein field equations of gravity and then we get the relation : @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the energy - momentum tensor in the einstein field equation .",
    "this equation means that the total energy in the universe is conserved but that the `` visible '' energy can be accelerated .",
    "this variation of inertia is compensated by the divergence of the stress energy of the continuous medium .",
    "there is no contradiction with einstein theory of gravitational fields and this gives a new perspective on the mach principle revisiting the `` absolute '' acceleration concept as a natural motion in space - time deformed by the matter - energy contained therein .",
    "we refer the reader to the paper of einstein on a related topic @xcite .",
    "the relativistic theory of an aether was discussed several times , see for e.g. @xcite , @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "our hypothesis is different and gives a relativistic theory of the deformation of continuous media ( for which the geometry is still described by the metric field whereas the strain tensor is an additional field ) .",
    "then , we could construct a more general stress tensor : @xmath143 with the _ elasticity tensor _ @xmath144 .",
    "in fact , a consistent theory should give the equations for the elasticity tensor ( which gives the mechanical property of the four dimensional continuous medium ) and we think it might be related to the metric tensor as well as its derivatives ( i.e. to the ricci tensor ) ."
