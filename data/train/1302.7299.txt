    "a better understanding of the nucleon as a bound state of quarks and gluons as well as the spectrum and internal structure of excited baryons remains a fundamental challenge and goal in hadronic physics .",
    "in particular , the mapping of the nucleon excitations provides access to strong interactions in the domain of quark confinement .",
    "while the peculiar phenomenon of confinement is experimentally well established and believed to be true , it remains analytically unproven and the connection to quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )  the fundamental theory of the strong interactions ",
    "is only poorly understood . in the early years of the 20th century",
    ", the study of the hydrogen spectrum has established without question that the understanding of the structure of a bound state and of its excitation spectrum need to be addressed simultaneously .",
    "the spectroscopy of excited baryon resonances and the study of their properties is thus complementary to understanding the structure of the nucleon in the deep inelastic scattering experiments that provide access to the properties of its constituents in the ground state .",
    "however , the collective degrees of freedom in such experiments are lost .",
    "an extensive data set of observables in light - meson photo- and electro - production reactions has been accumulated over recent years at facilities worldwide such as jefferson laboratory in the united states , the electron stretcher accelerator ( elsa ) , the mainz microtron ( mami ) , and the grenoble anneau accelerateur laser ( graal ) facility in europe as well as the 8 gev super photon ring ( spring-8 ) in japan hosting the laser electron photon experiment ( leps ) . the data set includes cross section data and polarisation observables for a large variety of final states , such as @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , etc .",
    "these data complement the earlier spectroscopy results from @xmath7- and @xmath8-induced reactions . for a long time , the lack of experimental data and the broad and overlapping nature of light - flavour baryon resonances has obscured our view of the nucleon excitation spectrum .",
    "these experiments therefore represent an important step toward the unambiguous extraction of the scattering amplitude in these reactions , which will allow the identification of individual resonance contributions .",
    "hadronic spectroscopy can not be interpreted by applying standard perturbation theory : phenomenology as well as qcd - based models have provided much of the insight and theoretical guidance .",
    "the recent advances in lattice gauge theory and the availability of large - scale computing technology make it possible for the first time to complement these approaches with numerical solutions of qcd .",
    "spin - parity assignments for excited states have even been successfully worked out by some groups . even though pion masses are still large , with @xmath9  mev , a rich spectrum of excited states is observed , and the low - lying states of some lattice - qcd calculations have the same quantum numbers as the states in models based on three quarks with wave functions based on the irreducible representations of su(6)@xmath10o(3 ) .",
    "the good qualitative agreement may be somewhat surprising since the connection between the relevant quark degrees of freedom , the constituent or dressed quarks , and those of the qcd lagrangian is not well understood .",
    "the lattice results appear to answer the long - standing question in hadron spectroscopy of whether the large number of excited baryons predicted by constituent quark models , but experimentally not observed , is realised in nature .",
    "the main goals of recent experiments are the determination of the excited baryon spectrum , the identification of possible new symmetries in the spectrum , and understanding the structure of states that appear to be built of three valence quarks at a microscopic level .",
    "the fundamental questions comprise the quest for the number of relevant degrees of freedom and a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for confinement and chiral symmetry breaking : how are the valence or dressed quarks with their clouds of gluons and quark - antiquark pairs related to the quark and gluon fields of the underlying lagrangian of qcd ? how does the chiral symmetry structure of qcd lead to dressed quarks and produce the well - known long distance behaviour ? the new experimental and theoretical information bears directly on both the search for , and our current understanding of baryon resonances .",
    "this paper will review the new data , present an overview of theoretical approaches and a sampling of the phenomenological work that has been developed based on the new experimental results .",
    "the particle data group  ( pdg ) regularly includes minireviews on a large variety of topics in their reviews of particle properties  ( rpp ) , which have been published biennially for many decades .",
    "useful minireviews on @xmath11 and @xmath12  resonances as well as charmed baryons can be found in the latest edition of the rpp  @xcite .",
    "owing to the lack of suitable @xmath8  beams , little progress has been reported in reviews on @xmath13 and @xmath14  resonances in the 2010 edition of the rpp  @xcite .",
    "the latter also includes a very brief note on @xmath15  baryons based on a previous review by meadows , published in the proceedings of the _ baryon 1980 _ conference  @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive review of baryon spectroscopy is contained in the 2009 article by klempt and richard  @xcite , who discuss prospects for photo- and electroproduction experiments .",
    "some of the open questions discussed in that review have already found answers from recent measurements .",
    "an older general article on baryon spectroscopy by hey and kelly  @xcite still provides useful information , particularly on some aspects of the theoretical data analysis .",
    "quark model developments have been discussed by capstick and roberts in 2000  @xcite .",
    "further reviews were dedicated to particular aspects of experiments using electromagnetic probes .",
    "about a decade ago , krusche and schadmand gave a nice summary on low - energy photoproduction  @xcite and in 2007 , drechsel and walcher looked at hadron structure at low @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "the work of tiator _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and aznauryan and burkert  @xcite provide more recent reviews on the electroexcitation of nucleon resonances .",
    "baryons are strongly interacting fermions and all established baryons are consistent with a @xmath17  configuration , so that the baryon number is @xmath18 .",
    "other exotic baryons have been proposed , such as pentaquarks ",
    "baryons made of four quarks and one antiquark @xmath19 , but their existence is not generally accepted . in quantum chromodynamics , heptaquarks ( 5 quarks , 2 antiquarks ) , nonaquarks ( 6 quarks , 3 antiquarks ) , etc .",
    "could also exist .",
    "baryons which consist only of @xmath20  and @xmath21  quarks are called nucleons if they have isospin @xmath22 or @xmath12  resonances if they have isospin @xmath23 .",
    "baryons containing @xmath24  quarks are called hyperons and are labelled as @xmath25 , and @xmath26 depending on the number of @xmath24  quarks and isospin ( table  [ table : baryons ] ) .",
    "baryons containing @xmath27 or @xmath28  quarks are labelled with an index .",
    "for example , the @xmath29 has isospin zero and quark content @xmath30 , the @xmath31 has quark content @xmath32 and the @xmath33 has quark content @xmath34 .",

    "the three flavors @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath24 can be treated in an approximate su(3 ) framework , in which each quark is a member of an su(3 ) triplet .",
    "the flavour wave functions of baryon states can then be constructed to be members of su(3 ) multiplets as @xmath43 the proton and neutron , of which all the matter that we see is composed , are members of both octets .",
    "the weight diagrams for the decuplet and octet representations of su(3 ) are shown in figure  [ fig : multiplet10 + 8 ] .",
    "the total baryon spin has two possible values .",
    "the three quark spins ( @xmath44 ) can yield a total baryon spin of either @xmath45 or @xmath46 .",
    "the latter configuration yields a completely symmetric spin wave function , whereas the @xmath45  state exhibits a mixed symmetry .",
    "the flavour and spin can be combined in an approximate spin - flavour su(6 ) , where the multiplets are @xmath47 these can be decomposed into flavour su(3 ) multiplets @xmath48 where the superscript @xmath49 gives the spin for each particle in the su(3 )  multiplet .",
    "the proton and neutron belong to the ground - state * 56 * , in which the orbital angular momentum between any pair of quarks is zero , and are members of the octet with spin and parity @xmath50 .",
    "the @xmath12  resonance is a member of the decuplet with spin and parity @xmath51 .",
    "we refer the interested reader to the literature for the correctly symmetrized wave functions for the su(3 ) multiplets .",
    "the wave functions of the * 70 * and * 20 * require some excitation of the spatial part to make the overall non - colour ( spin@xmath52space@xmath52flavour ) component of the wave function symmetric .",
    "orbital motion is accounted for by classifying states in su@xmath53o(3 ) supermultiplets , with the o(3 )  group describing the orbital motion .",
    "in addition to spin - flavour multiplets , it is convenient to classify baryons into bands according to the harmonic oscillator model with equal quanta of excitation , @xmath54 .",
    "each band consists of a number of supermultiplets , specified by @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the dimensionality of the su(6 ) representation , @xmath57 is the total quark orbital angular momentum , and @xmath58 is the parity .",
    "the first - excitation band contains only one supermultiplet , @xmath59 , corresponding to states with one unit of orbital angular momentum and negative parity , whereas the second - excitation band contains five supermultiplets corresponding to states with positive parity and either two units of angular momentum or one unit of radial excitation .",
    "table  [ table : classification ] shows the supermultiplets contained in the first three bands and the known , well - established baryons that are members of the ground - state * 56*. further quark - model assignments for some of the known baryons will be discussed in section  [ section : discussion ] .",

    "furthermore , this multiplet structure is expected to be repeated for every combination of spin and parity , leading to a very rich spectrum of states .",
    "one can also construct su(4 ) multiplets in which charm is replaced by beauty , as well as place the two sets of su(4 ) structures within a larger su(5 ) group to account for all the baryons that can be constructed from the five flavours of quark accessible at low to medium energies .",
    "it must be understood that the classification of states in su(4 ) and su(5 ) multiplets serves primarily for enumerating the possible states , as these symmetries are badly broken . only at the level of the su(3 )",
    "( @xmath75 and su(2 ) @xmath76 subgroups can these symmetries be used in any quantitative way to understand the structure and properties of these states .",
    "the multiplet structure for flavour su(4 ) is @xmath77 .",
    "the symmetric * 20 * contains the su(3 ) decuplet as a subset , forming the ` ground floor ' of the weight diagram shown in figure  [ figure : multiplets ]  ( a ) , and all the ground - state baryons in this multiplet have @xmath78 .",
    "the mixed - symmetric * 20*s ( figure  [ figure : multiplets ]  ( b ) ) contain the su(3 ) octets on the lowest level , and all the ground - state baryons in this multiplet have @xmath79 .",
    "the ground - floor state of the * 4 * ( figure  [ figure : multiplets ]  ( c ) ) is the su(3 ) singlet @xmath13 with @xmath80 .",
    "and two @xmath81  resonances on the middle layer of the mixed - symmetric * 20*. ]    within the flavour su(3 ) subgroups , the ground - state heavy baryons containing a single heavy quark belong either to a sextet of flavour symmetric states , or an antitriplet of flavour antisymmetric states , both of which sit on the second layer of the mixed - symmetric * 20 * of su(4 ) of figure  [ figure : multiplets ]  ( b ) .",
    "there is also expected to be a sextet of states with @xmath82 sitting on the second floor of the symmetric * 20*. the members of the two multiplets of singly - charmed baryons have flavour wave functions _ c^++&=&uuc,_c^+=(ud+du)c,_c^0=ddc + _ c^+&=&(us+su)c,_c^0=(ds+sd)c , + _ c^0&=&ssc , for the sextet and _ c^+=(ud - du)c , _ c^+=(us - su)c , _ c^0=(ds - sd)c , for the antitriplet .",
    "there is a similar set of flavour wave functions for baryons containing a single @xmath28 quark .    for the baryons containing two charm or two beauty quarks , the flavour wave functions are _ cc^++=ccu,_bb^0=bbu,_cc^+=ccs,_bb^-=bbs .",
    "when the two heavy quarks are different , there are two ways of constructing their flavour wave functions .",
    "one can imagine that the two heavy quarks are members of a ( pseudo-)symmetry group , su(2)@xmath83 , and that the pair of heavy quarks form either triplet or singlet representations of this group .",
    "two members of this triplet would then be the @xmath84 and @xmath85 , with the third member being the state _",
    ". the singlet state would then be _ bc^+=(cb - bc)u .",
    "alternatively , the flavour wave functions of these two states may be written as _",
    "bc^+=(uc+cu)b and _ bc^+=(uc - cu)b .",
    "the same choices of wave function need to be made when the light quark in the baryon is a strange quark .      an indispensable tool in hadron spectroscopy are of course the listings by the pdg .",
    "the group lists established baryon resonances in their baryon summary table .",
    "resonances are given a star rating based on their overall status .",
    "the ratings range from @xmath86 ( existence is certain ) and @xmath87 ( existence is likely to certain , but further confirmation is desirable ) to @xmath88 ( evidence of existence is only fair ) and @xmath89 ( evidence of existence is poor )  @xcite .    in its latest 2012 edition  @xcite",
    ", the pdg has replaced the historical naming scheme for observed light nonstrange baryons  based on elastic @xmath1  scattering  with a more general scheme which applies to all baryons independent of the production mechanism , including those resonances that are not produced in formation experiments , e.g. @xmath15  or @xmath26  resonances with @xmath90 and heavy baryons .",
    "for example , the @xmath12  resonance was observed originally in the @xmath91 partial wave with @xmath92 referring to the angular momentum between the @xmath7 and the nucleon in @xmath1  scattering experiments . with the plethora of new results coming from photoproduction experiments ,",
    "the resonance label has switched from the incoming @xmath1  partial wave , @xmath93 , to the spin - parity of the state .",
    "consequently , the name of the @xmath12  resonance has changed from @xmath94 to @xmath95 .",
    "baryons containing heavy quarks have been the focus of much attention recently , in particular since the experimental discovery of new resonances at fermilab and the large hadron collider  ( lhc ) .",
    "the heavy quark provides a ` flavour tag ' that may provide insights into the mechanism of confinement and the systematics of hadron resonances that can not be obtained with light quarks .",
    "all of the states containing heavy quarks are expected to be somewhat narrow , for the most part , so that their detection and isolation is relatively easy , and in general does not rely on the extensive partial - wave - analysis machinery usually necessary for identifying light baryons ( most states found to date have widths of a few mev , with the largest reported width being a few tens of mev , but with large uncertainties ) .",
    "such analyses may be required for determining the quantum numbers of the states , but even then , the procedure may still be simpler than in the case of light baryons , as it is expected to be largely free of the various interferences that arise with nearby , broad and overlapping resonances .",
    "in addition , the heavy - quark symmetries provide a framework for understanding and predicting the spectrum of one flavour of heavy baryons , say those containing a @xmath28 quark , if the spectrum of baryons containing a @xmath27 quark has been obtained @xcite .",
    "used judiciously , this heavy - quark symmetry can provide some qualitative insight , and perhaps even quantitative , into the spectrum of light baryons , particularly the hyperons .    despite the wealth of information that they can provide , and many theoretical treatises ,",
    "surprisingly little is known experimentally about the heavy baryons @xcite .",
    "this is largely because despite the comments above , they are difficult to produce . unlike the heavy mesons , there are no known resonant production mechanisms , so these baryons can only be obtained by continuum production , where cross sections are small , as products in the decays of heavy mesons , or at hadron colliders . not surprisingly , the @xmath0  factories , and cleo before that , have been the main source of these baryons .",
    "the first observations of beauty baryons were made at the organisation europenne pour la recherche nuclaire ( cern ) by the large electron positron ( lep ) experiments .",
    "these observations were mostly limited to a few decay modes of the @xmath96  baryon and some indications for other ground - state baryons based on their semileptonic decays . in recent years , the tevatron experiments at fermilab have observed a large number of new heavy - baryon states .",
    "in addition to direct observations of most of the ground states , the published results even include precision lifetime measurements , and several new decay modes .",
    "it is clear that future results will again come from cern .",
    "the lhc experiments have already demonstrated their discovery potential . in 2012 alone , lhcb has announced two new @xmath97  states and the compact muon solenoid ( cms ) collaoration has reported a new @xmath98  resonance ( table  [ table : heavybaryons ] ) .",

    "traditionally , effective field theories have little to say about excited hadrons .",
    "the quintessential example is chiral perturbation theory , in which an expansion parameter that is small compared with @xmath300 is needed .",
    "since baryonic excitation energies are typically of the same order as @xmath300 , there is no easy way to include more than one resonance in such a theory , or predict the mass differences between them . in the case of baryons containing a single heavy quark , however , the expansion parameter is the inverse mass of the heavy quark  @xcite . in the limit of an infinitely massive quark ,",
    "all baryonic mass differences are small compared with the mass of the heavy quark , and a limited number of predictions can be made .    when one of the quarks in a baryon is very heavy ( @xmath301 ) , that quark acts like a static source of colour around which the light quarks and gluons move .",
    "the spin of the heavy quark decouples from the light degrees of freedom .",
    "consequently , states in the spectrum are arranged in nearly degenerate doublets : when the light degrees of freedom have total angular momentum and parity @xmath302 , the possible baryons have total angular momentum @xmath303 and parity @xmath58 .",
    "since these two states are almost degenerate , the doublet is denoted @xmath304 .",
    "the exception occurs when @xmath305 , leading to a singlet with @xmath306 .",
    "since the mass difference between the states of a doublet arises from the chromomagnetic interaction with the heavy quark , the effective theory that has been developed predicts that this splitting is inversely proportional to the mass of the heavy quark .",
    "if the charm and beauty quarks are treated as heavy , this implies that mass splittings within multiplets of @xmath28-flavoured baryons can be predicted once the analogous splittings within the corresponding multiplets of @xmath27-flavoured baryons are known .",
    "furthermore , since the dynamics of the light quarks and gluons are completely insensitive to the flavour of the heavy quark , mass differences between multiplets should also be independent of the flavour of heavy quark .",
    "this means , for instance , that the mass difference between the spin - averaged mass of the @xmath307 and the spin averaged mass of the ground - state @xmath308 should be the same for the @xmath309 and the @xmath310 , modulo @xmath311 and @xmath312 corrections .",

    "one challenge experienced with the bag model was the existence of a number of spurious excitations connected with the motion of the centre of mass of the system .",

    "however , they have been applied to obtain a variety of properties of baryons , none of which are discussed in this manuscript .      a number of authors have examined the properties of a few baryons using chiral dynamics . they find that a number of states are ` dynamically - generated ' states .",
    "that is , they arise as result of the strong interaction ( chiral dynamics ) between baryons and mesons , and manifest themselves as poles in the scattering amplitude  @xcite .",
    "this approach has been used to describe properties of scattering amplitudes in the neighbourhood of the dynamically generated states , but it has not been used to predict where such states should lie .",
    "chiral symmetry predicts that there should exist approximately degenerate hadronic states of opposite parity .",
    "along with the nucleon , there should be a state with the same mass and opposite parity .",
    "there is a very simple interpretation to this prediction . in the chiral limit ,",
    "in which the pion is massless , a state containing a nucleon and a pion at rest has the same mass as a state with a single nucleon , but the two states have opposite parity .",
    "more recently , the interpretation is that there should be approximately degenerate states in the baryon spectrum , for instance , that have the same total angular momentum and opposite parity .",

    "a recent approach to quantum field theory is that has garnered some interest is the so - called ads / cft correspondence ( anti de sitter / conformal field theory ) , which establishes a duality between string theories defined on the five - dimensional ads space - time and conformal field theories in physical space - time  @xcite .",

    "a very useful summary of the calculation methodology and the results obtained is presented in the review by klempt and richard  @xcite .",
    "one of the important questions to be addressed is that of the relevant degrees of freedom in a baryon . does a baryon consist of three quarks , a quark and a diquark , or",
    "does it even have a very different , more complex structure . a better understanding of the properties of the known resonances and an improved mapping of the baryon spectra will help elucidate this question .",
    "recent photoproduction experiments in the light - baryon sector that aim at finding new or undiscovered states have yielded a number of candidates , but none of these is yet without doubt .",
    "it is worth pointing out again that , unlike for heavy baryons , the confirmation of a new light - baryon state is more challenging since the discovery is not inferred from a direct observation .",
    "a glance at tables  [ nucleonspec ] to [ baryonspec6 ] reveals that , among the light baryons , all of the theoretical approaches we have discussed in section  [ section : theory ] lead to rather similar results . in the heavy sector , the predictions of the diquark model show more striking differences from the three - quark model . in the model of ebert _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , the lack of excitations in the diquark means that there is a single negative - parity @xmath209  state along with a single @xmath210  @xmath326 in the region of low - lying excitations .",
    "these two states form an hqet @xmath307 doublet .",
    "the second @xmath209 state in this model is 417  mev heavier than the first , whereas the mass difference is between 150 and 250  mev in other models .",
    "similarly , there are two @xmath209 and two @xmath210  @xmath327 along with a single @xmath211  state .",
    "these form a @xmath307 doublet , a @xmath328 doublet and a @xmath329 singlet . in models",
    "in which all three quarks can be excited , there are three @xmath209 states , three @xmath210 states and a single @xmath211 , in each isospin sector , all within 250  mev of each other ( in the mass range 2600 to 2890  mev for the @xmath177 and 2750 to 2880  mev for the @xmath309 ) . in each sector , these seven states constitute a @xmath329 singlet , two @xmath307 doublets , and a @xmath328 doublet , although spin - dependent forces induce some mixing among states with the same @xmath330 . in the limit in which the mass of the quark becomes infinitely massive , the multiplet structure should be as described .",
    "this structure should therefore be more apparent for the @xmath28-flavoured baryons than for the charmed ones , and in the model of roberts and pervin  @xcite , this is indeed found to be the case .",
    "there are a number of experimentally observed @xmath177 states that have masses between 2700 and 2900 mev , but whose quantum numbers are unknown . if any of these states are found to have negative parity , it would suggest that the basic hypothesis of the quark - diquark model would not be correct , at least for baryons containing a heavy quark . among the heavy baryons",
    ", it can be seen that most approaches get the masses of the ground states roughly correct , mainly because these states are often used as input to the fits to the spectra .",
    "the details of the inter - quark potential then determines where the excited states lie , and this is where differences in the predictions of the masses emerge .",
    "nevertheless , for the low - lying excitations , most models are quite consistent , often predicting masses within a range of 50 mev of each other . the same is true of the lattice studies .",
    "it should be noted that the lattice predictions for the @xmath28-flavoured baryons are from a quenched study , while the results for the @xmath27-flavoured baryons are from an unquenched calculation .",
    "a number of the known charmed baryons have been omitted from tables [ baryonspec3 ] and [ baryonspec5 ] .",
    "this is because for each of these experimental states , there are a number of model candidates that are sufficiently close in mass to make an assignment ambiguous .",
    "two examples are the @xmath331 and the @xmath332 . the former is close in mass to a @xmath208  state with a predicted mass of 2887  mev in the model by roberts and pervin  @xcite , but also to a @xmath333  state with the same mass , and a @xmath211  state with a predicted mass of 2872  mev .",
    "this is not very different from the other models shown .",
    "the state at 2940  mev could be one of a number of positive - parity excitations .",
    "thus , other information , such as the strong and radiative decay widths of the state , will be needed before a definite assignment can be made . among the @xmath28-flavoured baryons ,",
    "the @xmath334 ground - state doublet is still to be identified experimentally , if the state at 5945  mev is indeed the @xmath208  state . in the fadeev study of garcilazo _",
    "_ for instance @xcite , the @xmath334 with @xmath335 is predicted to have a mass of 5937  mev , in very good agreement with the experimentally known state , and the @xmath208  state is predicted to be 30  mev heavier at 5967  mev . in tables",
    "[ baryonspec4 ] and [ baryonspec5 ] , there are experimental states that are included twice , alongside possible model states that they match .",
    "these are the @xmath336(2816 ) that is close in mass to model states with @xmath337 and @xmath210 , and the @xmath338(5945 ) that could be either the @xmath334 or the @xmath339 .",
    "examination of the multiplet structure of figure [ figure : multiplets ] provides some guidance regarding the states that can be expected .",
    "there should be an @xmath340 state for every triplet of @xmath309 found .",
    "there should be a doublet of @xmath336 for every @xmath177 , and another doublet for every triplet of @xmath309 .",
    "similarly , in the light sector , there should be a doublet of @xmath15 resonances for each quartet of @xmath12 states , and another doublet for each doublet of nucleons .",
    "there should be an @xmath26 for each @xmath12 quartet .",
    "there should also be a triplet of @xmath14 states for each nucleon and @xmath12 isospin multiplet , and there should be more @xmath13 states than nucleon doublets .      in the light baryon sector , we first note that the lattice results of edwards and collaborators  @xcite are significantly higher than the experimental masses for the nucleons and @xmath12 resonances .",
    "this is primarily because the results shown correspond to a pion mass of 396  mev . among the hyperons ,",
    "the predictions for the ground - state masses improve steadily as the number of strange quarks in the baryon increases . in this study , although the dependence of the results on the pion mass has been examined , no extrapolations to the physical pion mass have been carried out . at present ,",
    "chiral extrapolations for excited states are not yet very reliable . in this simulation ,",
    "the ordering of the states is consistent with the conventional quark model , in that the excited @xmath341  nucleon is more massive than the @xmath209  state .",
    "more generally , in all flavour sectors , the lower - lying positive - parity excitations are all more massive than the low - lying negative - parity states .",
    "we note , however , that there has been at least one lattice study in which the lowest - lying @xmath341  excitation has a mass that is lower than the lowest - lying @xmath209  state  @xcite .",
    "a second feature that emerges from this lattice simulation is that the number of lower - lying excitations is consistent with the conventional quark model , not the diquark version .",
    "of course , these results may change significantly as the pion mass decreases toward the physical value .",
    "in addition , the present calculation , as well as that of  @xcite , includes only one - particle states .",
    "the conclusions about which states are _ bona fide _ resonances may change when multi - particle states are included .",

    "solid evidence for these candidates is still missing , but it appears that the dynamics inside of a baryon go beyond the quark - diquark picture .    a comparison of the results from the different models does not indicate that any of the other models is significantly better than any of the others in predicting the masses of the light ( or heavy ) excited baryons . apart from the diquark model ,",
    "all the models predict roughly the same number of states , in roughly the same ordering with some variation in the masses . from the results shown ,",
    "it is not glaringly obvious that the relativistic models provide a better description of the baryon spectrum than the nonrelativistic ones ( or vice versa ) , for instance .",
    "more significant differences between the models will emerge if they are used to examine other properties of the baryons , such as their strong and electromagnetic decay widths .      in recent years",
    ", some doubts have been raised about the existence of @xmath544 .",
    "the various analyses do not agree very well and support has mostly come from the bonn - gatchina group .",
    "the latest analysis by the said group  @xcite finds no evidence for this resonance .",
    "moreover , the ebac group reported negative evidence in their latest analysis  @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the @xmath544 appears to be the only low - lying , `` well established '' resonance with @xmath545 which is not observed by the bes collaboration in @xmath169  decays .",
    "interestingly , experimental evidence for the other strange members of the @xmath546  multiplet is also currently non - existent , although all other octets of ( * 70*@xmath547 appear to be filled with the exception of the doubly - strange @xmath15  baryons .",
    "all models predict a group of @xmath459  baryons with masses around 1700  mev and the non - observation of these states would pose an interesting challenge for quark models .",
    "the clas collaboration has reported indications for a second nucleon resonance with @xmath51 and a mass of about 1720  mev  @xcite based on @xmath548 data  @xcite . while a second low - mass @xmath479  resonance is needed to completely fill the ( * 70*@xmath549 and ( * 56*@xmath550 supermultiplets of the second excitation band , quark models typically predict a further @xmath479  state with a mass about 150 - 200  mev higher ( table  [ nucleonspec ] ) .",
    "the new clas state requires a large @xmath551 coupling and a suppressed @xmath552  coupling , very different from the rpp listings of recent years .",
    "an alternative hypothesis is that , the well known @xmath479  resonance is much broader than originally thought , with the additional width coming from a large @xmath551  partial width .",
    "the @xmath553 breit - wigner width reported in the rpp was changed from @xmath554  150 - 300  mev ( 2010 edition ) to @xmath555  150 - 400  mev ( 2012 edition )",
    ".    the question of a second @xmath414 resonance with a mass around 1700  mev is certainly interesting .",
    "if it exists , such a state could be a candidate for a resonance beyond the quark model with structure different from the conventional @xmath556  picture .",
    "one possibility would be a hybrid baryon .",
    "the prediction of exotic mesons  states beyond the conventional quark model with three quark degrees of freedom  has inspired the search for hybrid mesons and glueballs for many decades , see e.g.  @xcite for a very comprehensive review .",
    "these states receive strong contributions to their overall quantum numbers from gluonic components and some have @xmath330  assignments which are not allowed for a conventional @xmath558  system .",
    "candidates have been identified through overpopulation of some conventional quark - model multiplets  @xcite .",
    "hybrid baryons are also expected to exist , but no candidates for baryonic hybrids currently exist .",
    "some lattice simulations have examined baryon states with significant gluon components in their correlation functions  @xcite and additional nucleons with @xmath559 and @xmath12 resonances with @xmath560 , having significant hybrid components in their wave functions , have resulted from such simulations .",
    "for the most part , these have been found to lie above the lowest band of excited , positive - parity , three - quark baryons . however , there are a few instances in which the hybrids penetrate into the band of conventional baryons . in the case of the @xmath13 resonances , there are @xmath341 hybrids at @xmath561  mev and @xmath562  mev . among the @xmath14 ,",
    "the lightest hybrid is again @xmath341 , and has a mass of @xmath563  mev .",
    "generally , though , the hybrids do have masses that are significantly larger than the first band of positive - parity excitations , particularly those with higher total angular momenta .",
    "we also note that where the hybrids sit in the spectrum is sensitive to the pion mass used . for a pion mass of 524  mev ,",
    "none of the hybrid masses fall within the band of conventional positive - parity excitations .",
    "it will be challenging to identify hybrid baryons experimentally as there are no obviously exotic signals as is the case with exotic mesons .",
    "since all @xmath330 can be accessed by conventional three - quark baryons , there are no exotic quantum numbers for exotic baryons .",
    "the extraction of helicity amplitudes in electroproduction experiments can help our understanding of the structure of baryon resonances .",
    "recent results from the clas collaboration  @xcite have ruled out the roper resonance , @xmath564 , as a @xmath565  hybrid state .",
    "other baryons have received attention owing to their unusual properties and have been interpreted beyond the regular quark model .",
    "for example , the nucleon resonance , @xmath566 , has an unusually large coupling to the @xmath567  decay mode and the hyperon resonance , @xmath568 , is very low in mass compared to predictions .",
    "an interpretation of these states as dynamically - generated resonances has been proposed , e.g.  @xcite .    a different group of exotic baryons are those which are composed of more than three constituent quarks . the idea of such multiquark hadrons is intriguing and was further nourished in 2003 by the announcement of a pentaquark candidate , the @xmath569 , in photoproduction , see e.g. the review in  @xcite .",
    "the observed candidate triggered much excitement because its mass appeared to be almost exactly as predicted : the chiral soliton model of @xcite predicted an antidecuplet of narrow @xmath570  baryons .",
    "the @xmath569 was initially confirmed by several ( low - statistics ) experiments but the experimental evidence has mostly died out in recent years .",
    "we refer to the literature for a more detailed discussion of this state .    in its latest ( 2012 ) edition ,",
    "the rpp lists a nucleon resonance , @xmath557 , with unknown quantum numbers and a one - star rating .",
    "this new state is associated with a narrow peak discovered in the reaction @xmath571  @xcite . while the experimental evidence for this narrow state appears solid ,",
    "its interpretation as a pentaquark is extremely weak .",
    "other explanations appear more likely and may even rule out the particle as an excited nucleon state .",
    "as discussed in section  [ section : photoeta ] , an interference effect was proposed involving the two low - lying @xmath572  states , @xmath566 and @xmath573 . alternatively , a threshold effect has been discussed which explains the observed structure in @xmath574 by a strong ( resonant or non - resonant ) @xmath575 coupling in the @xmath572  partial wave .",
    "the measurement of polarization observables in @xmath571 will help elucidate the origin of this new structure .",
    "baryon spectroscopy remains an active and lively field .",
    "many more results on heavy - flavour baryons can be expected from the lhc experiments and new surprises are just a matter of time . in the light - flavour sector , programs to extract polarization observables in electromagnetically - induced reactions will continue at the elsa and mami facilities . at the time of this writing",
    ", the recording of new data at jefferson lab has been suspended owing to the energy upgrade of the cebaf accelerator from 6 to 12  gev .",
    "data taking will likely resume in 2014/15 and hadron spectroscopy will continue at the gluex and clas12 experiments .",
    "the scientific focus of the future excited baryon programs is on the spectroscopy of doubly- and triply - strange baryons , @xmath15s and @xmath26s .",
    "the properties of these multi - strange states are poorly known as discussed earlier and only the @xmath330 of the @xmath576 has been ( directly ) determined experimentally .",
    "future experiments will provide better statistics and improved detector acceptance , which are considered the prime limitations of previous experiments .",
    "the @xmath15  hyperons have the unique feature of double strangeness : the quark content is @xmath577 and @xmath578",
    ". if the confining potential is independent of quark flavour , the energy of spatial excitations of a given pair of quarks decreases as their reduced mass is increased in many theoretical approaches .",
    "this means that the lightest excitations in each partial wave occur between the two strange quarks . in a spectator decay model , such states",
    "will not decay to the ground state @xmath15 and a pion because of orthogonality of the spatial wave functions of the two strange quarks in the excited state and the ground state .",
    "this removes the decay channel with the largest phase space for the lightest states in each partial wave , substantially reducing their widths .",
    "typically , @xmath579 is about 10 - 20  mev for the known lower - mass resonances , which is 5 - 30  times narrower than for @xmath11 , @xmath580 , @xmath581 , and @xmath582  states .",
    "these features , combined with their isospin of @xmath37 , render possible the study of the @xmath15 and its excited states in reactions such as @xmath583 , complementary to the challenging study of broad and overlapping @xmath11  states .",
    "this reaction will also render possible the study of excited @xmath14 and @xmath13  states  @xcite . at gsi",
    ", the panda collaboration has developed plans to study multi - strange hyperons in proton - antiproton annihilations in reactions such as @xmath584 .",
    "compared to photoproduction , the associated production of kaons is not required in @xmath151 reactions and the predicted @xmath15 and @xmath26 cross sections are large .",
    "it has been well known that rescattering effects play an important role in photoproduction processes .",
    "this means that in a particular reaction , the baryon and meson in an intermediate state are not necessarily the same as those in the final state and the reaction can proceed through different resonances .",
    "the ideal analysis of experimental data needs to be performed in the framework of a coupled - channel analysis since different channels feed into each other . for the same reason , it is necessary to carry out a combined search for nucleon resonances using both hadronic and photoproduction data .",
    "a coupled - channel analysis is theoretically very challenging and has led to the formation of the excited baryon analysis center ( ebac ) at jefferson lab .",
    "however , challenges also remain on the experimental side since the data on @xmath1 and @xmath585 reactions is scarce . as discussed in section  [ section : pionnucleon ] , a fair amount of data is available on @xmath586 , but statistics for reactions such as @xmath587 and @xmath588 are very poor and stem from a few decades ago .",
    "new possibilities for studying reactions using hadronic probes are being discussed for the japan proton accelerator research complex ( j - parc ) in tokai , japan .",
    "we acknowledge useful discussions with jose goity , jozef dudek , robert edwards , simon capstick , reinhard beck , ulrike thoma , andrey sarantsev , eberhard klempt , vitaliy shklyar , and igor strakovsky .",
