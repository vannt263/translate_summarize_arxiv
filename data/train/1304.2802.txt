    "in thin metallic films , the confinement in the direction perpendicular to the film plane gives rise to the quantization of the electronic wave functions . as a result of the appearance of the so - called quantum - well states ( qws),@xcite the properties of the metallic slabs",
    "might strongly depend on the exact thickness of the film .",
    "this dependence is a purely quantum phenomena known as quantum - size effect ( qse ) , which often appears as an oscillatory dependence of several physical properties on the film thickness .",
    "thin lead films exhibit important quantum - size oscillations in the layer - by - layer growth,@xcite first observed by he - atom scattering and attributed to interference with the quantum - well states .",

    "thus , the aim of the present work is performing a computational systematic study of the surface energy - loss function of pb(111 ) films with varying thickness , starting from the single monolayer case , up to the 15 ml thick slab .    an approximate description of thin film plasmons is given by the solution of the maxwell equations for the proper geometry.@xcite it leads to the coupling between the classical surface plasmons of the two different surfaces of the film .",
    "the resulting coupled modes of the film disperse as @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the bulk plasmon frequency , which is given by @xmath3 with @xmath4 being the average electron density and @xmath5 the electron effective mass , which in terms of the density parameter @xmath6 standing for the average inter - electron distance reads as @xmath7 .",
    "the energy splitting between the modes depends on the film thickness l and the in - plane momentum transfer @xmath8 .",
    "the low - energy mode @xmath9 corresponds to a symmetric induced charge profile in the direction perpendicular to the film plane , whereas the high - energy mode @xmath10 corresponds to an antisymmetric one.@xcite as l increases , the coupling between the two modes decreases . in the limit",
    "l@xmath111/@xmath8 the two film modes are decoupled and the two classical surface plasmons of frequency @xmath12 are retrieved .",
    "this model ignores the electronic structure of the film .",
    "this is a serious drawback since the ground state electronic structure has been shown to strongly affect the surface response to external perturbations .",
    "more detailed classical models showed the dependence of the surface plasmon dispersion on the microscopic details of the surface electronic density profile.@xcite    on a more quantitative level , the jellium model @xcite has been used to study the quantum - mechanical electrodynamical response of metal slabs,@xcite gaining basic insight into the nature of electronic excitations of metallic films . as an example",

    "thus , in the present work a first - principles approach is used to study the dielectric response of pb(111 ) films . indeed , using an _ ab initio _ calculation scheme possible anisotropy effects can be studied , which are missing in jellium models or in using the potentials of refs .   and , as they assume in - plane free - electron - like behavior .    in general , the plasmon modes of the pb(111 ) films",
