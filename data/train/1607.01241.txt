    "the continuous time random walk theory ( ctrw ) is a natural approach to the dynamics of the complex systems which are characterised by a large number of strong interacting components , a sensitivity on the initial conditions , resulting in an apparent stochastic motion , as well as long memory effects .",
    "ctrw resolves itself to a single jump probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath0 which determine both a length @xmath1 of the jump and a time interval @xmath2 between successive jumps . in the simplest case , ctrw",
    "is decoupled : @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath4 possesses algebraic tails , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 , the memory effects emerge : pdf obeys a fractional fokker - planck equation and the transport is subdiffusive @xcite . in the lvy walk model @xcite , in turn , the jump length is related to the velocity which is finite and makes the jumping time finite , then @xmath7 . in the present paper",
    ", we consider another version of ctrw assuming that the waiting time pdf depends on the current process value @xmath8 , @xmath9 , while jumps are instantaneous @xcite .",
    "this ansatz traces back to a picture of a motion in a medium with nonhomogeneously distributed traps which may invoke periods of long rests ; such a picture is common for complex @xcite and disordered systems @xcite .",
    "moreover , in some dynamical systems ( in particular of a generalised lorentz gas type ) the trajectories can stick to stability islands , nonhomogeneously distributed in the phase space , and abide there for a long time ( dynamical traps ) @xcite .",
    "the presence of a position - dependent distribution of sojourns is obvious for problems related to a population movement @xcite since some area provide more opportunities than the other whether in respect to an employment offer or as a touristic attraction . despite ubiquity of problems involving the position - dependent memory , the ctrw taking into account",
    "that effect has been rarely investigated .",
    "the conditional form of @xmath10 leads to a variable , position - dependent , diffusion coefficient in a corresponding fokker - planck equation @xcite and is a source of the anomalous transport : both a subdiffusion and an enhanced diffusion .",
    "the anomalous transport emerges even if @xmath10 is poissonian , i.e. in the absence of any memory effects .",
    "the analysis of many physical , in particular complex , systems may require taking into account long jumps by generalising the gaussian form of @xmath11 to arbitrary lvy stable distributions ( lvy flights ) .",
    "the @xmath12-stable form of @xmath11 may reflect a self - similar medium structure in complex systems where clusters of short jumps coexist with long jumps at all scales .",
    "the lvy flights occur in many areas of science @xcite and , in particular , are observed in heterogeneous materials @xcite .",
    "the space heterogeneity may require , in turn , the introduction of the variable diffusion coefficient .",
    "this happens , for example , in the folded polymers @xcite , and in a random walk description of transport in a composite medium with many layers characterised by a position - dependent trapping time statistics @xcite .",
    "the decoupled ctrw can alternatively be formulated in the framework of a subordination technique @xcite and generalised to the case of a medium with heterogeneously distributed traps where the heterogeneity is taken into account as a variable trap density @xcite .",
    "then the problem resolves itself to a fractional fokker - planck equation with a position - dependent diffusion coefficient .",
    "when a system is restricted in space , the particle , after reaching a boundary , may either escape or return to the bulk ; then appropriate boundary conditions apply : the absorbing and/or reflecting ones .",
    "the escape problem is well - known in the gaussian case @xcite ; it was also discussed for the lvy flights when trajectories are discontinuous and the boundary conditions nonlocal which results in a nontrivial leapover statistics @xcite .",
    "the escape problem for the lvy flights was studied both for a free particle @xcite and in the presence of an external deterministic force @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated in the field of the disordered systems that the first passage time statistics may be different for the annealed and quenched disorder @xcite .",
    "the first passage time distribution has divergent moments , in particular a mean , for waiting time distributions with the algebraic tails @xcite .",
    "the time characteristics of the escape process must be influenced by the medium structure since the particle abides longer in the region where the trap density is large .",
    "indeed , the variance for the confined lvy flights rises slowly with time if this density rises fast with the distance @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we study the influence of the medium heterogeneity on the escape process on the assumption that the jump length is governed by the symmetric stable lvy distribution and the sojourn time by the one - sided stable distribution , i.e. they have the algebraic tails .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we define ctrw process and the corresponding langevin dynamics .",
    "sec.iii is devoted to the first passage time problem : in sec.iiia we demonstrate how the escape rate depends on the trap density , as well as on the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the first passage time pdf is evaluated in the framework of the subordination technique in sec.iiib .",
    "we define the random walk process by two density distributions : the jump length and the waiting time distribution . they describe movement of a particle performing jumps and resting between successive jumps while the jumps themselves are instantaneous @xcite .",
    "the first distribution determines a probability @xmath14 ( @xmath15 is a dimension of the system ) that the displacement assumes a value in the interval @xmath16 .",
    "we assume that @xmath17 is a general symmetric stable distribution and the components of @xmath18 are independent",
    ". then the characteristic function reads @xmath19 where @xmath20 . in the case of the lvy flights ,",
    "the divergence of the mean squared displacement poses a difficulty if we are dealing with dynamics of massive particles .",
    "however , one may take into account that the finiteness of the system imposes a natural cut - off and makes the variance actually finite .",
    "this can be formalised either by introducing truncated distributions @xcite or a multiplicative noise at the boundary @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the infinite variance does not violate physical principles for such physical problems as diffusion in the energy space in spectroscopy or diffusion on a polymer chain in chemical space @xcite .",
    "the waiting time distribution @xmath21 , in turn , depends on the current position and this dependence reflects a nonhomogeneous trap distribution .",
    "two cases are distinguished . if @xmath21 has a poissonian form , the process is markovian without any memory effects @xcite while the presence of those effects implies algebraic and long tails of @xmath21 .",
    "they emerge , for example , in disordered systems as a result of the exponential distribution of site energies @xcite .",
    "we assume @xmath21 as a one - sided completely asymmetric lvy distribution @xmath22 with a skew parameter @xmath13 , @xmath23 ; it has the asymptotics @xmath24 and for small @xmath25 obeys a form @xcite , @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the stable form of the distribution @xmath21 is consistent with a subordination formalism which we will introduce at the end of this section .",
    "the position dependence enters @xmath30 via a trap density @xmath31 .",
    "it is natural to expect that a large trap density results in a long waiting time : the larger @xmath31 the longer the time the particle abides in the vicinity of @xmath32 .",
    "therefore we put @xmath33 and the equations defining the ctrw process read , @xmath34 where the components of @xmath35 and @xmath36 stand for mutually independent and uncorrelated random numbers distributed according to @xmath37 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "if @xmath21 has a poissonian form , eq.([eqrw ] ) is equivalent to a master equation the solution of which , @xmath38 , satisfies , in a limit of small wave numbers , a fractional fokker - planck equation with a variable diffusion coefficient @xcite .",
    "the density for @xmath39 , @xmath40 , follows from a simple scaling of the time variable which produces a laplace transform @xmath41 @xcite ; then the time derivative in the fokker - planck equation becomes fractional ( cf .",
    "eq.([glef ] ) ) .",
    "we assume a power - law form of the trap density @xmath31 which in the one - dimensional case reads @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a parameter characterising a degree of the medium nonhomogeneity and may assume , in principle , both positive and negative values .",
    "@xmath44 in the form ( [ godx ] ) may be interpreted as a result of a fractal trap structure .",
    "then the fractal density is proportional to @xmath45 , where @xmath46 stands for a fractal ( capacity ) dimension @xcite .",
    "more precisely , one evaluates , for a fixed , high resolution , the number of traps up to the distance @xmath8 ( @xmath47 ) and normalises the result to the number of traps in the unit interval .",
    "the comparison of the above expression for the fractal density with eq.([godx ] ) relates the parameter @xmath43 to the fractal dimension , @xmath48 , and imposes a restriction on @xmath43 : @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , the interpretation of eq.([godx ] ) as the fractal density implies that @xmath43 must always be non - positive . in the following ,",
    "we will also consider two versions of a two - dimensional case , @xmath50 .",
    "first , we assume an isotropic trap distribution for which @xmath51 where @xmath52 , and the fractal density equals @xmath53 ; accordingly , @xmath54 and @xmath55 . as a second case ,",
    "we consider a nonisotropic trap distribution , namely a structure where the nonhomogeneity is restricted to the one direction , i.e. , @xmath31 obeys eq.([godx ] ) in the @xmath8- direction while @xmath56 .",
    "we will call this case nonisotropic. dimension of the corresponding fractal is just a sum of dimensions in both directions : @xmath57 ( @xmath49 ) . therefore , @xmath46 depends on @xmath43 in the same way for the isotropic and nonisotropic cases but the range of @xmath43 is different @xcite .    , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and two values of @xmath43 . the curves ( from bottom to top )",
    "correspond to the following times : 5 , 6 , 10 , 50 and 100 ( a ) ; 450 , 500 , 550 , 600 and 800 ( b).,width=359 ]    the influence of the variable trap density on the pdf time evolution is illustrated in fig.1 .",
    "the one - dimensional trajectories were evaluated by sampling the jump length @xmath1 and the waiting time @xmath2 from the stable distributions @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively , according to a well - known procedure @xcite .",
    "the particle was initially positioned at @xmath62 and this point was regarded as a trap , namely the first jump took place after a period of resting .",
    "consequently , @xmath40 exhibits a peak at the origin which is larger for @xmath63 and then the evolution proceeds much slower .",
    "the tails of all the distributions obey the form @xmath64 .    alternatively",
    ", the dynamics may be formulated in terms of the subordination technique which is equivalent to ctrw in the diffusion limit .",
    "the second equation ( [ eqrw ] ) governs the random waiting time while the first equation is responsible for displacements as a function of a step number @xmath65 . in the continuous limit",
    ", the latter equation turns into a langevin equation and @xmath65 becomes an operational time . the random , physical time",
    "@xmath66 is defined by a continuous counterpart of the second equation ( [ eqrw ] ) that becomes an adjoined langevin equation . in the case of the variable trap density",
    ", the random time generator depends on the current position which explicitly enters the second equation .",
    "then the set of the langevin equations reads @xcite @xmath67 in the above equations , the increments of the noise @xmath25 represent the one - sided completely asymmetric lvy distribution @xmath22 and @xmath68 refers to a symmetric lvy stable distribution with a stability index @xmath12 which is the same for all directions .",
    "the second eq.([lan ] ) takes into account the medium structure : longer trapping times are more probable if the trap density @xmath31 is larger . in particular , for @xmath31 in the form ( [ godr ] ) and negative @xmath43 , the trapping time becomes infinite in the origin .",
    "eq.([lan ] ) is equivalent to the following system of equations @xcite , @xmath69 due to the transformation from ( [ lan ] ) to ( [ lanm ] ) , we can describe the dynamics as the ordinary subordination to the random time of a multiplicative process in the it interpretation .",
    "then the subordinator , given by the second equation ( [ lanm ] ) , becomes independent of a specific path and represents a renewal process that connects the times @xmath2 and @xmath66 , @xmath70 as a consequence , pdf of the process @xmath71 can be evaluated from pdf of @xmath72 by integration over @xmath2 .",
    "the asymptotics of pdf that follows from eq.([lanm ] ) is either a stretched - gaussian ( @xmath73 ) @xcite , @xmath74,\\ ] ] where @xmath75 $ ] , or a power - law ( @xmath76 ) , @xmath77 eq.([lanm ] ) corresponds to a fractional fokker - planck equation where the fractional derivatives are taken over both time and position @xcite .",
    "the first passage time problem resolves itself to a solution of that equation with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "we put a particle at @xmath78 and ask about a time needed to leave a given area .",
    "this escape problem is described by a first passage time density distribution defined as a probability that the time the particle needs to reach the edge of the area for the first time lies within the interval @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "the problem is determined by a density distribution @xmath80 which satisfies the initial condition and the absorbing boundary conditions at the edge .",
    "the survival probability , namely the probability that the particle never reached those barriers up to time @xmath66 ( it still remains inside the bulk ) , is given by @xmath81 where the integration is performed over the area inside the barriers .",
    "the first passage time density distribution reflects the change of the survival probability with time , @xmath82 and the mean first passage time , @xmath83 , serves as an estimator of a speed of the escape process .",
    "however , if the asymptotics of the waiting time distribution has power - law tails , @xmath84 with @xmath23 , the mean first passage time diverges .",
    "instead , one can simply characterise the first passage time statistics by a median location or an interquantile width @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one may introduce fractional moments of @xmath85 , @xmath86 which are finite for @xmath87 : the right inequality results from the asymptotics of @xmath85 and the left equality follows from @xmath88 ( the particle rests at the initial point ) .",
    "the moment @xmath89 is distinguished , it allows us to substitute the divergent mean first passage time @xmath90 by the escape rate which we define as an average over the inverse first passage time .",
    "then the quantity @xmath91 can serve as a measure estimating how fast the particles leave the bulk : large values of @xmath92 mean the fast escape . for a given distance between the initial point and the boundary ( @xmath93 ) , @xmath94 is just a mean ( effective ) particle velocity in the bulk .",
    "@xmath92 has been recently applied as a measure for the search efficiency in a study of random search processes involving long jumps @xcite .",
    "for the lvy flights , the arrival at the barrier often means a substantial overleap but , since jumps are instantaneous , the position of the particle after a jump does not influence the escape time and the mean velocity . in the following ,",
    "we estimate the speed of the escape process by evaluating the rate @xmath92 .",
    "the fractional moments corresponding to positive @xmath95 have a similar meaning as the mean first passage time , they will be evaluated in sec.iiib",
    ".      the time evolution of the stochastic trajectories is given by eq.([eqrw ] ) ; the successive displacements @xmath96 and waiting times @xmath97 are sampled from the respective distributions . since jumps are instantaneous , the escape time @xmath66 is determined by a sum of the waiting times , @xmath98 , where @xmath99 satisfies a condition @xmath100 . in the nonhomogeneous case",
    ", the density of traps diminishes with the distance and one can expect that the escape time is larger when one starts closer to the origin ; consequently , the choice of the initial condition influences the results . in the following ,",
    "if not stated otherwise , we assume that the initial position of the particle is uniformly distributed inside either an interval ( 1d case ) or a circle ( 2d case ) of a radius @xmath101 and the evolution begins from resting at the initial point .",
    "the absorbing barrier we define either as two points , @xmath102 , or a circle of the radius @xmath103 around the origin .",
    "notice , however , that the boundary conditions corresponding to the absorbing barriers must be defined differently for the lvy flights than those involving only short jumps @xcite . in fact , they are nonlocal : the barrier is reached when @xmath104 .",

    "in contrast to that picture , for @xmath73 @xmath107 diminishes when @xmath43 approaches zero which effect can be attributed to a complicated structure of the trajectory @xmath113 : it consists of many short jumps and may return to the origin many times ; we shall present such a trajectory in the next section . in 2d case",
    "we consider two trap geometries : the isotropic distribution and the case when @xmath31 depends only on @xmath8 , according to its definition in sec.ii .",
    "results for the former geometry are presented in the middle panel of fig.2 .",
    "the curves exhibit a similar pattern as for 1d case but @xmath92 is always smaller for a given @xmath43 which reflects the fact that particle easier leaves the neighbourhood of the origin  which region bear the main responsibility for trapping  when the medium dimensionality is larger .",
    "if the trap density varies only in one direction ( nonisotropic case ) , the slope of @xmath107 is larger , as it is demonstrated in fig.2 for @xmath114",

    "the dependence of @xmath92 on the system parameters appears similar to that presented in sec.iiia for the random walk simulations and we summarise the most important results of that analysis in fig.7 which corresponds to fig.2 .",
    "@xmath92 rises with @xmath43 for all the cases except @xmath73 and the growth is weakest for the isotropic 2d case .",
    "moreover , the results for 2d nonisotropic and the 1d cases are similar unless @xmath73 .",
    "presence of the mittag - leffler function in problems related to escape phenomena is also known for deterministic systems : it emerges in a description of the first passage time for intermittent weakly chaotic systems with invariant density similar to eq.([godr ] ) @xcite .",
    "we have considered transport properties in a stochastic system characterised by long resting times that are random but biased by the medium structure : the medium contains traps , responsible for the rests and memory effects .",
    "traps are nonhomogeneously distributed which has been taken into account by introducing  in the ctrw description  a position - dependent trap density .",
    "the assumed power - law form of this density has been interpreted as a result of the underlying self - similar structure .",
    "the jump lengths are governed by the general symmetric stable distribution . on the other hand , a stochastic dynamics , as a continuous counterpart of ctrw , has been formulated in terms of the subordination technique where the random time generator is position - dependent and the resulting system of the langevin equations resolves itself to a subordination of a multiplicative process to the random time .",
    "this approach allows us to take into account the nonhomogneity effects in a simple way : by a fractional fokker - planck equation .",
    "the heterogeneity of the medium structure influences time characteristics of the escape from a given area , in particular the first passage time pdf and its moments . to quantify the escape speed we have evaluated the escape rate @xmath92 , namely the moment of the order -1 , which is proportional to the effective particle velocity in the bulk , as a function of the stability index @xmath12 , memory parameter @xmath13 and the trap structure parameter @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath92 decreases with @xmath12 , @xmath13 and rising nonhomogeneity ( more negative @xmath43 ) , but only for @xmath76 .",
    "the gaussian case is special since the dependences @xmath107 and @xmath122 are not monotonous which effect can be attributed to multiple returns to the origin .",
    "analysis of 2d case shows that the escape speed is sensitive to the isotropy of the trap structure : @xmath92 differs for the nonisotropic case from that for the isotropic one though the underlying fractal structure has the same capacity dimension for a given @xmath43 .",
    "another consequence of the variable trap density is the sensitivity of the dynamics to the initial position which reflects the fact that the trapping is strongest near the origin .",
    "the variable and diminishing density @xmath44 substantially lowers the central part of the first passage time pdf making the escape time larger . on the other hand , the strong memory ( small @xmath13 ) may invoke a rapid escape which is a consequence of the enhancement of the waiting time pdf near the origin and occurs for any @xmath12 and @xmath43 .",
    "the problem of a random walk of a particle hopping among fractally distributed sites and experiencing long rests resolves itself to a fokker - planck equation with a fractional time derivative and a variable diffusion coefficient , cf .",
