    "the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe)@xcite is one of the prime examples where the strong interaction between electrons dictates the dynamics . a very fruitful approach for such a strongly correlated system is to look for model wavefunctions and model hamiltonians that are adiabatically connected to experimentally accessible systems . for the ground states and charged excitations of fqhe at several filling factors , wavefunctions have compact analytic forms@xcite .",
    "we can thus infer the properties of fqhe in the thermodynamic limit by reinterpret the wavefunctions in analogy to a two - dimensional plasmas@xcite , or as conformal blocks of some special conformal field theories ( cft)@xcite .",
    "in general for these approaches , incompressibility of fqhe is always assumed , and the dynamics of the bulk gapped excitations is not explicitly addressed .",
    "incompressibility of fqhe is defined by the neutral bulk collective excitations .",
    "such excitations are important for understanding which topological phases of the fqhe can be stabilized , and are also very relevant to the recent development in fractional chern insulator , where the issue of incompressibility and its mapping to the fqhe@xcite are areas of active research .",
    "the first formal treatment of the neutral excitations came from the single mode approximation ( sma ) for the magneto - roton@xcite mode , where good model wavefunctions of density wave excitations can be constructed numerically up to the momentum of roton minimum , beyond which sma is no longer valid@xcite . following the experimental studies of the neutral excitations by several groups@xcite , more recently the model wavefunctions are constructed numerically both for the magneto - roton modes in the read - rezayi ( rr ) series , and the neutral fermion mode@xcite in the moore - read ( mr ) state , the latter reflecting its non - abelian nature .",
    "one approach in constructing the model wavefunctions is to treat the neutral excitations as excitons of the composite fermions@xcite .",
    "another approach is to apply the formalism of jack polynomials@xcite with appropriate root configurations and clustering properties@xcite .",
    "these wavefunctions are in principle good for the entire range of momenta . in practice , however , the long wavelength limit is not accessible due to the limitation by the system size . interestingly , even though the underlying phenomenological pictures of the neutral excitations can be different , it is found numerically that both approaches mentioned above produce exactly the same set of model wavefunctions with very rich algebraic structures . just like the ground states and bulk charged excitations of many fqh fluids , where model wavefunctions have natural forms with no variational parameters , in this paper",
    "we show how the model wavefunctions for the bulk neutral excitations can be formulated analytically , thereby unifying previous numerical works on this issue .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec_wfconstruction ] the model wavefunctions for both the magnetoroton mode and the neutral fermion mode are constructed explicitly , generalizing the jastrow factor in the laughlin wavefunction both at odd and even filling . in sec .",
    "[ sec_diagram ] a diagrammatic scheme is introduced to represent the bulk neutral many - body wavefunctions in an intuitive way , which also shed light on the way these neutral excitations can be interpreted as  elementary excitations \" of the fqh fluid . in sec .",
    "[ sec_quadrupole ] the compact analytic form of the model wavefunctions is exploited to calculate the thermodynamic energy gap of the neutral excitations in the long wavelength limit , which lies in the region inaccessible to numerical calculation .",
    "this also leads to an interesting connection of the fqhe bulk dynamics to the free energy cost of particle fusion in the plasma analogy .",
    "[ sec_conclusion ] gives the conclusion and discussion of the paper .",
    "previous works on the numerical generation of the neutral excitation model wavefunctions are done mostly on spherical geometry , where only gapped bulk excitations are present for the incompressible phases . the bulk neutral excitations are also present on disk geometry , though the spectrum is more complicated due to the presence of edge excitations ( more comments on it in sec .  [ sec_conclusion ] ) . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "the bulk excitations should be insensitive to the geometry of the hall manifold .",
    "in fact even for finite systems , we can go to the ",
    "conformal limit\"@xcite on either sperical or disk geometry , by removing the single particle wavefunction normalization constant from the many - body wavefunctions ; the resulting model wavefunctions are identical . for example",
    ", the laughlin wavefunction of the two fermions at filling factor @xmath0 on the sphere is given by @xmath1 , and on the disk it is given by @xmath2 .",
    "the string of binary numbers represents the orbital basis@xcite , where the @xmath3 denote occupied orbitals and @xmath4 denote unoccupied orbitals . on the sphere ,",
    "the leftmost orbital is at the north pole , and the rightmost orbital is at the south pole ; on the disk , the leftmost orbital is at the center of the disk , while the rightmost orbital is at the edge . for two electrons ,",
    "the proper number of orbitals is _ four _ to account for the shift on the sphere@xcite . when the single particle normalization is removed , both wavefunctions lead to the familiar laughlin wavefunction in the conformal limit @xmath5 , where the coefficient of the root configuration @xmath6 is normalized to unity .",
    "it is thus convenient to unambiguously rewrite the wavefunction with the un - normalized single particle wavefunction on the disk in the lowest landau level ( lll ) , where the @xmath7 orbital is given by @xmath8(the gaussian factor is omitted since it does not play any role here for fqhe ) , with holomorphic variables @xmath9 . here",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 are the coordinates in the hall manifold , @xmath12 is the magnetic length and @xmath13 is the particle index .",
    "explicitly we have @xmath14 .",
    "having identified the relationship between many - body wavefunctions on different geometries , in this paper all analytic wavefunctions are presented as polynomials of @xmath15 .",
    "thus in principle these model wavefunctions are for neutral excitations on the disk , but they can be easily converted into model wavefunctions on the sphere by multiplying appropriate spherical single particle normalization factors .",
    "in particular , after the conversion the model wavefunctions in this paper are _ identical _ to those generated numerically in @xcite . on the disk each model wavefunction",
    "is labeled by its total angular momentum about the z - axis perpendicular to the disk , i.e.@xmath16 measured from the ground state ( with the ground state having @xmath17 ) .",
    "the neutral excitations are states with negative @xmath18(states with positive @xmath16 contain gapless edge excitations ) .",
    "when the highest weight condition is imposed@xcite , these states correspond to the highest weight state on the sphere in the total angular momentum sector @xmath19 , with all the quasiparticles piled at the north pole@xcite .",
    "since the mapping from the disk wavefunctions to the sphere wavefunctions is unambiguous , in this paper all model wavefunctions are labeled by @xmath20 instead of @xmath16 , to facilitate comparison with numerical works on the spherical geometry in the literature .    on the sphere",
    "the ground state is the laughlin wavefunction in total angular momentum @xmath21 sector .",
    "the corresponding model hamiltonian on the disk made of haldane pseudopotentials@xcite is given by @xmath22 , with @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the @xmath7 laguerre polynomial and @xmath25 is the guiding center coordinate of the @xmath26 particle .",
    "physically , @xmath27 is the short range interaction that projects into the two - body hilbert space with the relative angular momentum smaller than @xmath28 .",
    "we now present the wavefunctions of the neutral excitations for the fermionic laughlin state at filling factor @xmath29 in the lowest landau level ( lll ) , where @xmath28 is odd .",

    "for example , in eq.([collect ] ) the product in the @xmath34 wavefunction does not contain @xmath35 .",
    "an explanation of eq.([collect ] ) is in order here .",
    "the @xmath34 state , which is the quadrupole excitation in the thermodynamic limit@xcite , is obtained from the ground state by reducing the power of one pair of particles ( which we can choose arbitrarily as particle @xmath36 and @xmath37 because of antisymmetrization ) by _ two _ , followed by antisymmetrizing over all particles .",
    "this scheme naturally forbids an @xmath38 state by the pair excitation , since if we reduce the power of one pair of particles by _ one _ , antisymmetrization kills the state .",
    "the @xmath39 state is generated by pairing particle @xmath36 with another particle ( which we can arbitrarily choose as particle @xmath40 ) and reducing their pair power by one .",
    "it is now clear how the modes in other momentum sectors @xmath41 are generated .",
    "naturally for a total of @xmath42 particles , the family of neutral excitation modes ends at @xmath43 , agreeing with the numerical schemes in the literature .",
    "we have numerically checked for different system sizes that all wavefunctions in eq.([collect ] ) agrees exactly with those generated in@xcite .",
    "indeed all wavefunctions here satisfy the highest weight condition , and the states relax to the ground state far away from the excited pairs ; these are exactly the conditions we used to numerically generate the unique model wavefunction in each momentum sector@xcite .",
    "the same scheme applies to the mr state .",
    "it is instructive to first see how the mr ground state is obtained .",
    "the laughlin wavefunction at half filling is given by the jack polynomial@xcite @xmath44 .",
    "for fermions this is not a valid state ; instead the ground state was constructed by a pairing mechanism@xcite , which is also a jack polynomial @xmath45 .",
    "explicitly in the wavefunction , the pairing reduces the power of each pair of particles by _",

    "though we can no longer represent eq.([opairing ] ) as a pfaffian , comparing the antisymmetrized products we can see eq.([opairing ] ) is really the same as that of eq.([pairing ] ) , only with an odd number of particles .",
    "for the model three - body hamiltonian , this is a zero - energy abelian quasihole state @xmath52 in the angular momentum sector @xmath53 .",
    "the magneto - roton mode and the neutral fermion mode are obtained from eq.([pairing ] ) and eq.([opairing ] ) respectively by reducing the powers in the jastrow factor the same way as what is done for the laughlin state .    to write down all the analytic wavefunctions shown above in a more formal way",

    "one should note , however , the different many - body wavefunctions corresponding to different lattice diagrams _ may not _ be linearly independent , and this is a subject requiring further research .",
    "all the wavefunctions presented in this paper are linearly independent because they are in different angular momentum sectors .",
    "for systems with finite number of particles , the analytic wavefunctions presented in the previous two sections do not seem to be advantageous in calculating either the density profile or the variational energy , unless there is an ingenious way of implementing monte carlo techniques based on the explicit analytic form . in the thermodynamic limit where the number of particles @xmath69 , the spherical and disk geometry are equivalent , at least as far as the bulk neutral excitations are concerned .",
    "one can convert the total angular momentum @xmath20 of a state on the sphere to the linear momentum @xmath70 on the disk by @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the monopole strength at the center of sphere@xcite . in the thermodynamic limit @xmath73 .",
    "thus any state of finite @xmath20 on the sphere corresponds to a state with linear momentum @xmath74 on the plane , when we take the limit @xmath69 . in this way ,",
    "the analytic wavefunctions are useful in calculating the thermodynamic neutral excitation gap in the long wavelength limit , or the so called  quadrupole gap \" . writing @xmath75 , for the laughlin state , the energy gap is given by @xmath76    physical arguments above lead to the conjecture that eq.([energy ] ) is independent of @xmath77 , and it would be nice to see a rigorous mathematical proof .",
    "we already know @xcite that in the @xmath34 and @xmath39 sector , the single mode approximation ( sma ) , which generates model wavefunctions via density wave excitations , is exact for the magneto - roton model wavefunctions on the sphere .",
    "thus in the thermodynamic limit , the analytic wavefunctions on the disk labeled by @xmath78 are also identical to those generated by sma in the limit @xmath74 .",
    "it is thus easiest to evaluate eq.([energy ] ) in the sector @xmath34 .",
    "defining the guiding center ladder operators as @xmath79 , and denoting the laughlin wavefunction as @xmath80 , we have @xmath81 in the thermodynamic limit , the normalization constant of the @xmath34 mode ( and also for @xmath39 mode ) is thus related to the long wavelength expansion of the ground state guiding center structure factor : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the guiding center spin@xcite , and @xmath84 is the guiding center metric@xcite .",
    "we thus have @xmath85 the numerator of eq.([energy ] ) can be calculated with the plasma analogy .",
    "note in eq.([collect ] ) , each wavefunction only has one pair of particles with relative angular momentum smaller than @xmath28 .",
    "after antisymmetrization all particle indices are equivalent , so we only need to look at the action of @xmath86 on @xmath87 with @xmath88 which is equivalent to the product within the antisymmetrization of the @xmath34 wavefunction in eq.([collect ] ) .",
    "writing @xmath89 , with some simple algebra we obtain @xmath90    treating @xmath91 and @xmath92 as independent particle variables , we can integrate out @xmath91 and the numerator of eq.([energy ] ) is given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the normalization constant of the laughlin state @xmath95 , and @xmath96 is the norm of the following wavefunction : @xmath97 obtained from eq.([vpsi ] ) , which can be evaluated as the free energy of two - dimensional one - component plasma ( ocp ) on a disk with radius @xmath98 and elementary charge @xmath99 , where particle @xmath36 interacts with the rest of the particles with charge @xmath100 .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath101    both @xmath102 are the free energies of ocp in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath69 ) , where @xmath103 is for @xmath42 particles , each with charge @xmath104 with logarithmic two - body interactions together with a neutralizing background of radius @xmath105 ; for @xmath106 , we have the same neutralizing background , but with @xmath107 particles of charge @xmath104 , and exactly one particle with charge @xmath100 .",
    "thus @xmath108 is the free energy cost of fusing two particles of charge @xmath104 to create a particle of charge @xmath100 , which is an @xmath109 effect .",
    "the denominator is proportional to @xmath110 , which is negative by convention and it determines the overall strength of the quadrupole gap . note for integer qh @xmath111 , and the quadrupole gap goes to infinity",
    ". this should be the case since the guiding center degrees of freedom are frozen out .",
    "similar calculations can be carried out for the magneto - roton mode in the mr state .",
    "analogous to eq.([sma ] ) we have @xmath112 , and in the long wavelength limit we have @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the guiding center spin for the mr state , and @xmath115 is the standard two - component plasma free energy for the mr ground state@xcite .",
    "the charge for the attractive interaction between the two components is given by @xmath116 , while the charge for the interaction between one component and the neutralizing background is given by @xmath117 .",
    "@xmath118 is the free energy cost of fusing _ three particles _ for each component to create one particle with charge @xmath119 but with the same @xmath120 .",
    "the evaluation of the long wavelength gap of the neutral fermion mode is less transparent .",
    "the difficulty lies with evaluating the normalization constant of @xmath121 .",
    "there is no known sma analogy for the neutral fermion mode , and it is not known if in the thermodynamic limit the gap should be inversely proportional to the guiding center spin . on the other hand @xmath122 can be mapped to 2-component plasma as well , and we obtain @xmath123    here @xmath124 is the free energy of the 2-component plasma similar to that of @xmath115 with only one difference : there is exactly one _ more _ particle carrying charge @xmath125 that interacts with the neutralizing background , and its @xmath126 charge is zero . this is how an unpaired fermion in the mr state is interpreted in the plasma analogy .",
    "furthermore , @xmath127 is the energy cost of fusing the unpaired fermion with one pair of two other fermions , creating a particle with charge @xmath128 but again with _ _",

    "the calculation of the prefactor in eq.([energymrnf ] ) is not yet known .",
    "in conclusion , analytic wavefunctions for both the magneto - roton modes and the neutral fermion modes are presented .",
    "the energy gap of the quadrupole excitation in the thermodynamic limit can be related to the free energy cost of the fusion of charges in the plasma energy , and is inversely proportional to the guiding center spin which characterizes its topological order .",
    "this is the first time that the plasma analogy is extended to neutral excitations of fqhe , and the analogy not only applies to the wavefunctions , but also to the dynamics as well . since the neutral excitations in the long wavelength limit",
    "is buried in the multi - roton continuum , it is important to calculate the decay rate of these neutral modes .",
    "numerical calculation has been performed to show that even in the continuum the decay rate of the collective mode is very small .",
    "this opens up the possibility of experimental detection of these modes .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the decay rate of collective neutral modes will be presented elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the neutral excitations in the single component fqhe can now be understood in several coherent framework , at least for the laughlin and moore - read states , with possible generalization to the entire read - rezayi series .",

    "it is now satisfactory to see that compact analytic real space wavefunctions in electron coordinates , which initiated the theoretical understandings of fqhe , can now be extended from ground states and charged bulk excitations to include neutral bulk excitations .",
    "some questions still remain on if the neutral excitations proposed so far completely describes the energy spectrum of fqhe .",
