    "the theorem states that the eigenvalues of the perturbed matrix , i.e. the hamiltonian with disorder , can not differ from the eigenvalues of the disorder free hamiltonian by more than the largest eigenvalue of the perturbing hamiltonian .",
    "as the perturbation matrix is diagonal the eigenvalues are easily obtained .",
    "therefore , for weak disorder the flat band is almost maintained . in the very long time",
    "limit the experimental state would disperse throughout the lattice for diagonal disorder . the same is not true for off - diagonal disorder . in this case",

    "<S> however , as discussed later , it was not possible to observe the non - diffracting state when @xmath40 42 @xmath1 , because next - nearest - neighbor coupling in these lattices is non - negligible over the 7 cm length of the chip , destroying the flat band . </S>",
    "<S> the remainder of the paper shall , therefore , focus on the lattice fabricated with @xmath0 = 44 @xmath1  the most compact lieb lattice fabricated where the flat band could be excited . </S>",

    "<S> _ it is well known that for femtosecond laser writing , depth - dependent aberrations imparted on the laser beam by the air - glass interface can significantly affect the properties of the written waveguides @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this will clearly result in depth - dependent lattice properties . to assess the homogeneity of the fabricated lieb lattice </S>",
    "<S> , we investigated how the coupling constant between two evanescently coupled waveguides varied as a function of depth . </S>",
    "<S> we inscribed arrays of two - waveguide evanescent field couplers at six different depths , from 100 to 600 @xmath1 in steps of 100 @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> each coupler was fabricated using the same waveguide - to - waveguide separation in the interaction region ( 22 @xmath1 ) , and same waveguide - to - waveguide angle ( relative to the vertical axis in fig . </S>",

    "<S> 5 sets of 17 couplers were fabricated , each set consisting of couplers with interaction lengths between 1 and 65 mm , in steps of 4 mm . </S>",
    "<S> each coupler was characterized by injecting 780 nm light into one of the waveguides and measuring the output coupling ratio . using this data , and the procedure outlined in @xcite , the mean and standard deviation of the coupling constant at each depth </S>",
    "<S> was evaluated to be @xmath30 0.01 mm@xmath43 and @xmath30 0.002 mm@xmath43 respectively for couplers fabricated up to a maximum depth of 300 @xmath1 . after this , both the coupling constant and variance were observed to become a function of depth , with deeper structures exhibiting a progressively higher variance .    to investigate </S>",
    "<S> whether the observed variation in coupling constant was due to random variations in the waveguide - to - waveguide separation ( off - diagonal disorder ) , or random variations in waveguide propagation constants ( diagonal disorder ) , we performed a second set of experiments , where an array of couplers with different interaction lengths were fabricated at a single depth inside the substrate . </S>",
    "<S> the waveguide - to - waveguide angle and separation in the interaction region were set to 45@xmath4 and 15 @xmath1 respectively  the reduced interaction separation was used to reduce the coupling length . </S>",
    "<S> coupling characteristics for these couplers were observed to be close to ideal , with near - complete transfer of power from input waveguide to the other waveguide achieved after one coupling length . since complete transfer of energy from one waveguide to the another in an evanescent field coupler is only possible if the waveguides support modes with identical propagation constants , we conclude that local variations in waveguide propagation constants are negligible in our lieb lattices . hence </S>",
    "<S> , diagonal disorder is not significant .    </S>",
    "<S> given the results outlined above , all optical measurements of the lieb lattice were performed by injecting light into the primitive sites surrounding the @xmath44 site ( circled in fig . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig2 ] ( b ) , or circled c - site in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ( c ) , confirming that light injected into a - sites diffracts more than light injected into b- or c - sites . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig3 ] ( a ) shows a schematic of the experimental set - up used to excite the flat - band state . </S>",
    "<S> laser light of 780 nm emerging from a single - mode fibre was collimated using lens l@xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> this light was then focused through a zero - order nulled ( for 780 nm ) diffractive optical element ( doe ) ( binary - phase , square - checker - board pattern ) using lens l@xmath34 , to generated a square array of diffracted orders at the focus of l@xmath34 . using lenses l@xmath35 and l@xmath36 </S>",
    "<S> , these diffraction orders were relay - imaged to the spatial filter , which blocks all orders , except for the four first - order `` spots '' . using lenses l@xmath33 and l@xmath38 , the four spots were relay - imaged to the input - facet of the lieb lattice ( fig . [ fig3](b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the size of each spot on the lattice facet could be controlled via the diameter of the beam entering lens l@xmath38 and its focal length , and the spacing between the spots could be controlled via the distance of the doe from lens l@xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the relative optical phases between the spots could be inferred by viewing the four - spot interference pattern in the fraunhofer regime ( using a camera not shown ) . as shown in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ( c ) and ( d ) , the relative phases between the spots could be controlled by translating the doe in the @xmath2-@xmath3-plane ( the @xmath28 axis is the beam propagation axis ) . </S>",
    "<S> independent control over the spacing and size of the four spots on the facet of the lieb lattice enabled simultaneous excitation of two b- and two c - site waveguides for a given primitive cell . to couple the spots to the lattice in a controllable manner , 780@xmath610 nm light from a filtered broad - band source </S>",
    "<S> was used to flood - illuminate the output end of the lattice and excite all the guided modes . using camera-1 , it was thus possible to simultaneously view both the lattice modes and the excitation spots , enabling us to launch light specifically to the modes of the lattice .    to excite the flat - band state , the doe position was set to produce four equal intensity spots ( relative standard deviation ( rsd ) : 5.7 @xmath45 ) , with alternating @xmath46 and @xmath47 phases , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ( c ) . </S>",
    "<S> these four spots were then coupled to the b- and c - sites for the chosen primitive cell . </S>",
    "<S> a proof that such a state will excite the flat band is given in the supplementary material . the ( 7 - 7 ) , ( 6 - 7 ) , ( 7 - 6 ) and ( 6 - 6 ) primitive cells were each excited , and the output diffraction patterns observed using camera-2 . as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] ( a - d ) , when the flat - band state was excited , no significant tunneling of light into the surrounding lattice sites could be observed after 7 cm of propagation . </S>",
    "<S> non - diffracting states remain localized . </S>",
    "<S> absence of diffraction was not observed in lattices with @xmath40 42 @xmath1 , which we attribute to non - negligible next - nearest - neighbor coupling .    to confirm that the observed absence of diffraction is particular to the phase and intensity distribution of the injected state </S>",
    "<S> , we coupled another state to the lattice , where b- and c - sites of a primitive cell are excited with close to equal intensity ( rsd : 5.7 @xmath45 ) but equal phase ( the equal - phase state ) , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ( d ) . as presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] ( e - h ) , this state is not localized when injected into the ( 7 - 7 ) , ( 6 - 7 ) , ( 7 - 6 ) and ( 6 - 6 ) primitive cells , due to its orthogonality to the flat - band - state . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the diffraction patterns shown in figs . [ fig4 ] ( e - h ) are different , depending on which cell is excited , due to off - diagonal disorder . as discussed earlier , we are still able to successfully excite the flat band </S>",

    "<S> _ we have experimentally excited a flat - band state in a photonic lieb lattice , and observed non - diffractive propagation . </S>",
    "<S> such states may provide useful applications in , for instance , image processing and precision measurements . </S>",
    "<S> it would be intriguing to extend this study to the case where nonlinearities are present . </S>",
    "<S> this would provide a platform to simulate and investigate the behavior of interacting particles with flat dispersion relations , suggesting an interesting route towards strongly - correlated states of matter in photonic systems @xcite .    while in the final stage of preparing the current manuscript we became aware of similar work by vicencio et al . </S>",
