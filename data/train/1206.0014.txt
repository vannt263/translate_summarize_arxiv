    "<S> we analyze two approaches to quantum state transfer in solid - state spin systems . </S>",
    "<S> first , we consider unpolarized spin - chains and extend previous analysis to various experimentally relevant imperfections , including quenched disorder , dynamical decoherence , and uncompensated long range coupling . in finite - length chains , </S>",
    "<S> the interplay between disorder - induced localization and decoherence yields a natural optimal channel fidelity , which we calculate . </S>",
    "<S> long - range dipolar couplings induce a finite intrinsic lifetime for the mediating eigenmode ; extensive numerical simulations of dipolar chains of lengths up to @xmath0 show remarkably high fidelity despite these decay processes . </S>",
    "<S> we further consider the extension of the protocol to bosonic systems of coupled oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> second , we introduce a quantum mirror based architecture for universal quantum computing which exploits _ all _ of the spins in the system as potential qubits . </S>",
    "<S> while this dramatically increases the number of qubits available , the composite operations required to manipulate `` dark '' spin qubits significantly raise the error threshold for robust operation . finally , as an example , we demonstrate that eigenmode - mediated state transfer can enable robust long - range logic between spatially separated nitrogen - vacancy registers in diamond ; numerical simulations confirm that high fidelity gates are achievable even in the presence of moderate disorder . </S>"
