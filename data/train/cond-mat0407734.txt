    "recent experimental studies of hopping conductance in anderson insulators showed striking non - equilibrium effects that persist for long times at low temperature .",
    "@xcite these results support early theoretical predictions of a low - temperature glassy phase in interacting disordered electron systems in the strongly localized limit .",
    "@xcite in this regime the essential physics is well captured by the coulomb glass model that describes a system of interacting electrons hopping between randomly distributed sites that correspond to the localization centers of the single - electron wavefunctions .",
    "@xcite    although coulomb glass models have been extensively studied during the last thirty years and their equilibrium properties are by now fairly well understood @xcite much less is known about the properties of coulomb glasses out of equilibrium .",
    "@xcite    in reference the off - equilibrium dynamics of the coulomb glass was investigated by studying the scaling properties of the non - stationary correlation and response functions , a tool often used in the study of other glassy systems such as structural and spin glasses .",
    "it has recently been realized that further insights on the nature of the glassy phase can be gained from the analysis of dynamical heterogeneities .",
    "@xcite this approach is particularly appealing in the context of coulomb glasses since the low - temperature hopping conductance is dominated by the diffusion of carriers on a set of conducting percolation paths .",
    "@xcite we expect interactions between the electrons to have strong effects on this type of motion since hops of individual carriers alter the effective random potential felt by the others and thus modify the structure of the percolating network .",
    "fluctuation effects of this type were shown to lead to low - frequency @xmath0-like noise in the conductance of coulomb glasses .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we investigate the dynamical properties of the three dimensional random - site coulomb glass model by kinetic monte carlo simulation using a realistic microscopic dynamics that favors the emergence of local effective constraints in the kinetics . in our simulations",
    "the system is initially quenched from infinite temperature to a working temperature @xmath1 and its evolution in time is characterized for different values of @xmath1 through the time dependence of the relevant correlation functions .",
    "one of our main observations is the appearance of a dynamical crossover from equilibrium dynamics to slow non - equilibrium dynamics at a temperature @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the equilibrium freezing transition temperature of the model .",
    "@xcite this crossover takes place even for relatively small system sizes and occurs at the temperature at which the equilibration time of the finite sample becomes much longer than the time - scale of the simulation . in this regime",
    "the time - dependent correlation functions exhibit slow relaxation and have aging properties .",
    "we found that the dynamics of the coulomb glass is heterogeneous as observed in other glassy systems .",
    "@xcite heterogeneities can be characterized by examination of the evolution of diffusion fronts .",
    "a statistical analysis of the electron trajectories over a fixed time window shows that most carriers belong to one or the other of two groups .",
    "the first group is that of those electrons that diffused away from their initial position during the chosen time interval .",
    "the second group is that of the electrons that remained confined in relatively small regions in space during that time .",
    "an exchange of electrons between these two dynamical modes takes place as the system relaxes after a temperature quench . in the aging regime",
    "this exchange is very slow and the non - equilibrium excess of electrons with metallic hopping present in the system right after the quench decreases logarithmically with time . in this temperature range",
    "the diffusion is anomalous .",
    "we found that the mean squared displacement @xmath4 where the exponent is @xmath5 and depends on the age of the system . in the equilibrium regime time translation invariance",
    "is recovered and we observe normal diffusion .",
    "however , the bimodal dynamical heterogeneity still persists .",
    "the occupancy of the two dynamical modes is stationary and its temperature dependence reflects a crossover from a low - temperature regime with a high concentration of electrons forming fluctuating dipoles to a high - temperature regime in which the concentration of diffusive electrons is high .",

    "this is yet another manifestation of the slow relaxation that characterizes the glassy phase of the coulomb glass .",
    "the characterization of diffusion through a diffusion exponent is familiar in the study of random walks in random media were one generally finds sub - diffusive behavior ( @xmath108 ) in those physical situations in which the distribution of the time intervals between successive hops of the diffusing particle has sufficiently long tails that the central limit theorem no longer holds .",
    "@xcite it would be interesting to examine the distribution of this times in the aging regime of our system .",
    "to establish a relationship between the observed aging effects and the microscopic motion of electrons we analyzed the evolution of the diffusion front .",

    "the center of the second peak increases linearly with time and its location coincides with the mean squared displacements at long times .",
    "the interpretation of these results is that the electron dynamics is heterogeneous and characterized by the existence of two dynamical modes that can be clearly distinguished : ( a ) diffusive mode : electron motion is unbound and diffusive .",

    "we only show the ten first hops after a waiting time @xmath119 .    some of the trajectories correspond to electrons that hop back and forth between two sites . @xmath116 then oscillates between @xmath124 and @xmath125 , the distance between the sites involved in the motion .",
    "this fluctuating dipolar motion contributes to most of the weight of the first peak in the histograms of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6](a ) .",
    "it is important to note that , although this fluctuating motion appears regular when plotted as a function @xmath123 , it is in fact extremely irregular when viewed as a function of time , since the time intervals between successive jumps are very widely distributed .",

    "the structure of the modes is qualitatively different , however .",
    "not only the distribution of hopping rates is now much broader but a small fraction of electrons with low hopping rate lies in between the two modes .",

    "this is a direct manifestation of the exchange mechanism that we hinted at above .",

    "since the latter decreases logarithmically with time , this simple argument predicts logarithmic relaxation of the conductivity which is one of the main experimental observations . whether the assumptions leading to this result are valid has to await direct computation of the current in the aging regime , in the presence of an applied electric field .",

    "@xcite we found that , for each timescale two classes of electrons may be identified , those that have diffusive motion during the observation time and those whose motion in the same time interval remains confined . only electrons belonging to the former class contribute to the dc conductivity while the others only contribute to the dielectric screening .    in the region of low temperatures where aging is observed electrons are slowly exchanged between these two modes with the consequence that the population of metallic electrons decreases logarithmically with time without appreciable change of the their diffusion constant .",

    "we believe that the local microscopic dynamics used here , which is a realistic description of hopping processes in experimental systems , plays an important role in the phenomena that we observed .",
    "this type of dynamics favors the appearance of local effective constraints that relate our model to kinetically constrained models in which slow dynamics arises from restrictions on the allowed transitions between configurations .",

    "<S> two groups of carriers can be identified at each time scale , electrons whose motion is diffusive within a selected time window and electrons that during the same time interval remain confined in small regions in space . during the relaxation that follows a temperature quench an exchange of electrons between these two groups takes place and the non - equilibrium excess of diffusive electrons initially present decreases logarithmically with time as the system relaxes . </S>",
    "<S> this bimodal dynamical heterogeneity persists at higher temperatures when time translation invariance is restored and electron diffusion is normal . </S>",
    "<S> the occupancy of the two dynamical modes is then stationary and its temperature dependence reflects a crossover between a low - temperature regime with a high concentration of electrons forming fluctuating dipoles and a high - temperature regime in which the concentration of diffusive electrons is high . </S>"
