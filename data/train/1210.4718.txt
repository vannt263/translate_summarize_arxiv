    "in relativistic heavy - ion collision experiments ( rhice ) the collision of two nuclei leads to a hot dense region which is expected to rapidly achieve state of thermal equilibrium .",
    "for the relevant range of energies and colliding nuclei at rhic and at lhc there is compelling evidence that a region of quark - gluon plasma is created in these collisions .",
    "simulation results as well as experimental data , such as elliptic flow measurements , all point towards a very rapid thermalization to the qgp phase , within a proper time less than 1 fm .",
    "we thus have a system which starts out in the confining phase , and within proper time of ( probably much less than ) 1 fm makes a transition to the qgp phase ( with maximum temperature estimates ranging from 200 mev to more than 700 mev for the relevant energies in these experiments ) .",
    "lattice results show that for real world qcd with small baryon density ( as appropriate for the central rapidity regions in rhice ) the transition is likely to be a crossover . with that",
    ", the dynamics of the transition depends crucially on the rate of temperature change compared to the time scale of the evolution of the order parameter field . for an equilibrium transition",
    ", we had studied the formation of z(3 ) domains and associated _ qgp strings _ using a first order transition dynamics via bubble nucleation @xcite .",
    "the transition was simulated using the polyakov loop , @xmath4 , as an order parameter for the confinement - deconfinement transition @xcite .",
    "these studies were appropriate for large chemical potential case , as in lower energy collisions , where the transition is expected to be of first order .",
    "though , the results for z(3 ) wall network etc . having certain universal characters , may be applicable in more general context , even for a cross - over , as explained in @xcite .",
    "however , given the very short time scale of initial thermalization to qgp state , an equilibrium dynamics of the transition appears unlikely .",
    "a more appropriate description of the transition should employ quenched dynamics in which the growth of z(3 ) domains will be via spinodal decomposition . in this paper",
    "we carry out such a study using the polyakov loop , @xmath4 , as an an order parameter for the confinement - deconfinement transition , with an effective potential of the kind used in refs.@xcite . for our simulation results",
    "we choose a definite parametrization of the effective potential @xcite as was used in our previous works @xcite .",
    "we model the phase transition in this polyakov loop model , with the initial field configuration ( in the confining phase ) covering a small neighborhood of the confining vacuum @xmath0 as appropriate for the initial @xmath5 = 0 system . in a quench",
    ", the temperature rapidly ( rather suddenly ) increases to its maximum value @xmath6 with the effective potential changed accordingly . the initial field @xmath3 ,",
    "unable to relax to the new equilibrium vacuum state in this short time , becomes unstable and rolls down in different directions from the top of the central hill in the effective potential of @xmath3 .",
    "we study the formation of z(3 ) domain structure during this evolution . when explicit z(3 ) symmetry breaking effects ( arising from dynamical quark effects ) are small , then we find well defined z(3 ) domains which coarsen in time . with a symmetric initial patch of @xmath3 , all the three z(3 )",
    "domains form with random shapes and rapidly increase in size by coarsening .",
    "remarkably , the magnitude plot of @xmath3 shows vacuum bubble like configurations , such as those which arise in a first order transition , arising during the quench in this case ( when the initial field rolls down in different directions ) .",
    "this first order transition like behavior occurs even though there is no metastable vacuum separated by a barrier from the true vacuum for the parameter values used .",
    "these bubble like configurations expand as well , somewhat in similar manner as during a first order transition .",
    "when the initial patch of @xmath3 is only partially symmetric around @xmath7 ( as appropriate for small explicit symmetry breaking from quark effects ) , the dynamics retains these qualitative aspects with expected changes .",
    "thus , true vacuum domains ( with @xmath8 ) are more abundant and they also grow fast at the cost of the other two z(3 ) domains ( which are now metastable due to explicit symmetry breaking ) . still , for small explicit symmetry breaking , all the three types of domains occur during the initial stages of the transition .",
    "there are few , small z(3 ) walls as there are fewer metastable z(3 ) domains embedded in the dominant true vacuum with @xmath8 .",
    "these walls shrink rapidly and eventually only the true vacuum survives .",
    "the dynamics is found to be very different when the explicit symmetry breaking due to quark effects is taken to be strong . in this case",
    "the initial patch of @xmath3 ( around equilibrium point for @xmath9 effective potential ) could be significantly shifted towards the true vacuum for the quenched @xmath10 effective potential .",
    "in such a situation , @xmath3 will roll down roughly along the same direction with angular variations becoming smaller during the roll down . in this case only @xmath8 vacuum survives and no other z(3 ) domains are formed .",
    "also , in this case we do not find bubble - like configurations .",
    "however , in this case we find huge oscillations of @xmath3 with large length scales .",
    "this behavior is known from previous studies of the dynamics of scalar field in a quench @xcite and is expected here when angular variations are small .",
    "the dynamics of field in such a case is dominated by large length scale coherent oscillations .",
    "it leads to novel scenarios of reheating via parametric resonance in the case of inflation in the early universe @xcite . in our case of rhice",
    "also it raises important questions about the possibility of parametric resonance and of novel modes of particle production from these large oscillations of @xmath3 during the early stages of the transition . in the present work",
    "we explore another important effect of these large oscillations , on the evolution of flow anisotropies in rhice .",
    "as most of the flow anisotropies are expected to develop during first few fm of the qgp formation , it becomes an important question if the presence of large oscillations of @xmath3 can affect the development of these flow anisotropies .",
    "as we will see , this indeed happens and these large oscillations lead to large fluctuations in flow anisotropy .",
    "we mention here that we do not discuss which of the cases discussed here ( small , or large explicit symmetry breaking ) may actually be realized in rhice .",
    "this is primarily because of lack of understanding of the magnitude of explicit symmetry breaking term near @xmath11 .",
    "( some discussion of this has been provided in our earlier works @xcite . )",
    "also , the spread of initial field configuration about confining vacuum plays a crucial role here and that in turn depends on details of pre - equilibration stage .",
    "a proper understanding ( or modeling ) of this stage and resulting estimate of the initial spread is essential before one can make more definitive statements about the dynamics of the transition .",
    "we hope to discuss these issues in future .",
    "our main purpose here is to illustrate the possibility of very different types of dynamics of transition depending on the initial configuration .",
    "our results show that in quenched dynamics , z(3 ) domains , and resulting z(3 ) domain walls , can last for any reasonably length of time only when explicit symmetry breaking terms are very small .",
    "otherwise either different domains do not form at all , hence no z(3 ) walls are formed , or fewer metastable z(3 ) domains form embedded in most abundant true vacuum region . in the latter case resulting z(3 ) walls are smaller to begin with , and disappear quickly .",
    "importance of z(3 ) walls in rhice has been discussed by us in previous works , where we have also emphasized non - trivial scattering of quarks from z(3 ) walls .",
    "we have explored its consequences for cosmology as well as for rhice @xcite , including the possibility of cp violating scattering of quarks from z(3 ) walls leading to interesting observational implications @xcite .",
    "recently an interesting possibility has been discussed by asakawa et al . in ref .",
    "@xcite where it is argued that scattering of partons from z(3 ) walls may account for small viscosity as well as large opacity of qgp . our results for the formation of z(3 ) domains during quench ( which are abundant only for small explicit symmetry breaking case ) can be relevant for the studies in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this context",
    "we mention that smallest reasonable size z(3 ) domains ( hence z(3 ) walls ) we find are of order 1 - 2 fm at very early times , and at that stage the magnitude of the polyakov loop order parameter @xmath3 is very small , of order few percent of its vacuum expectation value .",
    "the quark scattering from z(3 ) walls is likely to be small for such a small magnitude of @xmath3 @xcite . by the time the magnitude of @xmath3 becomes significant , domains coarsen to have large sizes , of order several fm .",
    "thus , in the context of our model it appears difficult to form very small z(3 ) domains which still can scatter partons effectively ( as needed in the study of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it is important to note that our results for domain growth and fluctuations for the quench case are dominated by the spinodal instabilities during the roll down of the field from the top of the hill of the effective potential .",
    "these instabilities arise primarily from the nature of the quench when the initial field configuration becomes unstable to exponential growth of long wavelength modes due to sudden change in the shape of the effective potential ( the quench ) , and will be in general present even if the transition is a cross - over . in this sense",
    "we believe that the qualitative aspects of our results have a wider applicability and are not crucially dependent on the specific form of the effective potential used here .",
    "we briefly mention here that issues related to the physical meaning of z(3 ) domains etc .",
    "have been discussed in the literature ( see , discussion of these in our earlier works @xcite and we will not repeat it here .",
    "we only note that recent work of deka et al .",
    "@xcite has provided a support for the existence of these metastable vacua from lattice .",
    "we also note that a simulation of spinodal decomposition in polyakov loop model has been carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite , where fluctuations in the polyakov loop and growth of long wavelength modes ( representing domain formation ) are investigated . in comparison ,",
    "the main focus of our work is on detailed growth of domains due to coarsening with and without explicit symmetry breaking , new bubble like structures , and existence of large fluctuations affecting flow anisotropies in important ways .",
    "the paper is organized in the following manner . in section",
    "ii , we discuss the essential aspects of the polyakov loop model of confinement - deconfinement phase transition and the effective potential used from ref.@xcite . section iii presents the numerical technique of simulating the phase transition via quench .",
    "we first discuss the case without any explicit symmetry breaking and study the formation and evolution of z(3 ) domains during the quench .",
    "iv discusses the unexpected result of bubble like structures arising during the quench .",
    "we also discuss the case of small explicit symmetry breaking term when true vacuum domains become more abundant , but overall picture of the transition remains roughly similar . in sec.v",
    "we discuss the case when explicit symmetry breaking effects are strong leading to @xmath3 rolling down everywhere roughly along @xmath8 .",
    "this leads to large oscillations of @xmath3 . in sec .",
    "vi we study the effects of these large oscillations on flow anisotropy and show that it leads to large fluctuations in elliptic flow and spatial eccentricity ( as compared to the case of equilibrium transition ) .",
    "section viii presents conclusions .",
    "we briefly recall the salient features of the model we use for the confinement - deconfinement phase transition .",
    "the order parameter is taken to be the the expectation value of polyakov loop @xmath4 ,    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the time component of the vector potential @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the generators of @xmath16 in the fundamental representation , @xmath17 denotes path ordering in the euclidean time @xmath18 , g is the gauge coupling , and @xmath19 with t being the temperature .",

    "( hereafter , we will use the same notation @xmath4 to denote the expectation value of the polyakov loop . )",
    "hence the z(n ) symmetry is restored below @xmath26 .",
    "z(n ) symmetry is broken spontaneously above @xmath26 where @xmath4 is non - zero corresponding to the finite free energy of the test quark .",
    "effective theory of the polyakov loop has been proposed by several authors with various parameters fitted to reproduce lattice results for pure qcd @xcite .",
    "we use the polyakov loop effective theory proposed by pisarski @xcite .",
    "the effective lagrangian density can be written as    @xmath27    where the effective potential @xmath28 for the polyakov loop , in case of pure gauge theory is given as    @xmath29    at low temperature where @xmath30 , the potential has only one minimum .",
    "as temperature becomes higher than @xmath26 the polyakov loop develops a non vanishing vacuum expectation value @xmath31 , and the @xmath32 term , coming from the @xmath33 term above leads to @xmath34 generate vacua .",
    "now in the deconfined phase , for a small range of temperature above @xmath26 , the @xmath30 extremum becomes the local minimum ( false vacuum ) and a potential barrier exist between the local minimum and global minimum ( true vacuum ) of the potential .",
    "( however , the quench temperature used here is much higher than this range and there is no barrier present at such temperatures . )",
    "the effects of dynamical quarks is included in terms of explicit breaking of the @xmath34 symmetry which is represented in the effective potential by inclusion of a linear term in @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the potential of eq.(4 ) with the linear term becomes ,    @xmath35    here coefficient @xmath36 measures the strength of explicit symmetry breaking .",

    "in this work , we carry out a @xmath43 dimensional field theoretic simulation of the dynamics of confinement - deconfinement transition in a quench .",
    "first we work within the framework of bjorken s boost invariant longitudinal expansion model @xcite ( without any transverse expansion ) for the central rapidity region in rhice . to model the quench , we take the initial field configuration to constitute a small patch around @xmath7 which corresponds to the vacuum configuration for the confining phase .",

    "the initial field configuration in the neighborhood of @xmath7 becomes unstable when evolved with the effective potential ( eq.(5 ) ) with @xmath62 mev ( at @xmath63 1 fm ) . as @xmath3 rolls down in different direction , settling in one of the three z(3 ) vacua , different z(3 ) domains form .",
    "initially , as the phase of @xmath3 is taken to vary randomly from one lattice site to the next , there are no well defined domains . also , the magnitude of @xmath3 is very small initially making any association of z(3 ) structure meaningless at such early stages .",
    "situation remains similar for very early times as seen in fig.1a at an early stage @xmath64 fm ( i.e. 0.2 fm after the quench ) . in fig.1",
    "we have shown the values of the phase of @xmath3 around the three z(3 ) vacua in terms of different shades ( colors ) to focus on the evolution of z(3 ) domain structure .",

    "this may also have important implications for rhice .",
    "more importantly this new possibility of transition dynamics needs to be understood and analyzed in detail , see @xcite for a study of these issues .",

    "this patch is then evolved with the temperature profile of woods - saxon shape as described above with the central temperature having initial value equal to @xmath47 mev . as a sample case",
    "we give results for the case when the initial ( elliptical shaped ) temperature profile has an eccentricity of 0.5 ( with the major and minor axes being along the x and y axes respectively ) , which for uniform energy density will correspond to @xmath95 from eq.(7 ) .",

    "this equilibrium initial condition is implemented in the following manner here . for the initial temperature profile of woods - saxon shape ( again , with a given eccentricity ) , with initial temperature @xmath97 mev , we first need to determine the appropriate @xmath3 configuration which assumes vacuum expectation value everywhere depending on the local value of the temperature . to achieve this , we first evolve field configuration for 1000 time steps with highly dissipative dynamics while keeping the temperature profile to remain fixed at the initial profile .",
    "a reasonably smooth initial test profile of @xmath3 is used as the initial field configuration . with highly dissipative evolution",

    "this gives us confidence that our procedure of achieving equilibrated configuration works well .",
    "in contrast , initial value of @xmath89 for the case of quench in fig.5 is very different showing the importance of fluctuations for this case .",
    "we further see huge fluctuations in the values of @xmath89 and @xmath94 in fig.5 compared to the equilibrium case shown in fig.6 . note that though there are oscillations in @xmath94 for the equilibrium case also , they do not change much from one event to another .",
    "in contrast , for the quench case in fig.5 , there are huge variations between the two different realizations , i.e. different events .",
    "these large fluctuations in fig.5 arise due to large oscillations in @xmath3 which itself depends on the nature of randomness in the initial field configuration .",
    "note that plots for @xmath89 in fig.6 show a sharp change near @xmath99 fm after which @xmath89 settles down to a value close to zero .",
    "the central temperature at that stage is about 208 mev .",
    "presumably a large part of the region ( away from the central part where temperature is lower due to a woods - saxon profile ) may be undergoing transition at that stage leading to large changes in field dynamics .",
    "we have checked with the contour plots that the ellipticity of the profile of @xmath3 , as well as that of energy density , does not undergo rapid changes during this stage .",
    "( in fact this is a reflection of a shortcoming in our model where the temperature profile is taken to have definite initial eccentricity , and its further expansion is with definite acceleration as discussed above , starting with zero transverse velocity .",
    "a more appropriate model may be to take the time evolution of the spatial eccentricity of the temperature profile from hydrodynamical models and study the evolution of @xmath3 using that . )",
    "we note strong fluctuations in both these quantities around this stage , which may be responsible for these large changes in @xmath89 at this stage .",
    "we hope to develop better understanding of the dynamics during this stage and discuss in a followup work . at present what is important to note",
    "is that , apart from this peak region , everywhere else @xmath89 shows rather stable values settling down to a value close to zero after @xmath100 5.5 fm , and does not fluctuate much , as compared to the quench case in fig.5a .    to further illustrate the importance of fluctuations for the quench case , we show plots for the case with zero eccentricity of the qgp region ( i.e. for the temperature profile ) which also will mean zero value of @xmath89 for uniform density case . thus , any non - zero @xmath89 and @xmath94",
    "arise only from the randomness in the initial field configuration . fig.7a and fig.7b show the plots for the equilibrium case .",
    "we note that @xmath89 and @xmath94 remain very small , apart from a large change near @xmath99 fm for @xmath89 , just as in fig.6 . again , at present what is important to note is that , apart from this peak region , everywhere else @xmath89 and @xmath94 remain very small for equilibrium case , as expected for the zero eccentricity case .",
    "different plots in fig.7a and fig.7b correspond to different realizations of the initial random field configuration .",
    "this situation should be contrasted with the quenched case as shown in fig.7c and fig.7d .",
    "note that @xmath89 and @xmath94 now fluctuate with large amplitudes , even though eccentricity of temperature profile is zero .",
    "further , different realizations of the initial random field configurations lead to widely different plots of these quantities .",
    "this shows the fluctuating nature of development of flow anisotropies if large @xmath3 fluctuations are present .",
    "these results suggest the dynamics of the order parameter field , especially such large length scale oscillations may play an important role in determining flow anisotropies and it needs to be incorporated in the hydrodynamical models .",

    "( a ) and ( b ) show plots of @xmath89 and @xmath94 for the equilibrium transition case , while ( c ) and ( d ) correspond to the quench case .",
    "we carry out 2@xmath1011 dimensional simulation to study the dynamics of confinement - deconfinement transition as a quench for the central rapidity region in relativistic heavy - ion collision experiments .",
    "we work in the framework of the polyakov loop model . the initial field ( in the confining phase )",
    "is taken to cover a small neighborhood of the confining vacuum @xmath0 as appropriate for the initial @xmath5 = 0 system .",
    "this initial field @xmath3 , unable to relax to the new equilibrium vacuum state with quenched potential at @xmath62 mev , becomes unstable and rolls down in different directions from the top of the central hill in the effective potential of @xmath3 .",
    "we study the formation of z(3 ) domain structure during this evolution . when explicit z(3 ) symmetry breaking effects ( arising from dynamical quark effects ) are small , then we find well defined z(3 ) domains which coarsen in time . during early stages z(3 ) domains ( and z(3 ) domain walls ) have small sizes of order 1 fm .",
    "however at this stage the magnitude of @xmath3 is very small , of order few present of its vacuum expectation value .",
    "domains coarsen rapidly as the magnitude of @xmath3 grows and by the time @xmath102 fm , domains are of size several fm .",
    "surprisingly , the magnitude plot of @xmath3 shows vacuum bubble like configurations , such as those which arise in a first order transition .",
    "this first order transition like behavior occurs even though there is no metastable vacuum separated by a barrier from the true vacuum for the parameter values used .",
    "these bubble like configurations expand as well , somewhat in a similar manner as during a first order transition .",
    "this result points to new interesting possibilities for the phase transition dynamics .",
    "for example , such bubble like structures may lead to a dynamics of phase separation in the case of the universe similar to the original witten s scenario @xcite , even when there is no underlying first order transition .",
    "this may also have important implications for rhice .",
    "this new possibility of transition dynamics needs to be understood and analyzed in detail , see @xcite for a study of these issues .    when the initial patch of @xmath3 is only partially symmetric around @xmath7 ( as appropriate for small explicit symmetry breaking from quark effects ) , the dynamics retains these qualitative aspects , with true vacuum domains ( with @xmath8 ) growing dominantly at the cost of the other two metastable z(3 ) domains . in this case z(3 ) walls are fewer and relatively smaller , and they disappear more quickly . when the initial patch of @xmath3 ( around equilibrium point for @xmath9 effective potential )",
    "is significantly shifted towards the true vacuum for the quenched @xmath10 effective potential ( as will happen when explicit symmetry breaking is strong ) , then @xmath3 rolls down roughly along the same direction with angular variations becoming smaller during the roll down . in this case only @xmath8 vacuum survives and no other z(3 ) domains are formed .",
    "also , in this case we do not find bubble - like configurations .",
    "however , in this case we find huge oscillations of @xmath3 with large length scales .",
    "this is similar to the scenarios of reheating via parametric resonance in the case of inflation in the early universe . in our case of rhice",
    "also it raises important questions about the possibility of novel modes of particle production from these large oscillations of @xmath3 during the early stages of the transition .",
    "we have shown that these large @xmath3 oscillations can strongly affect the evolution of flow anisotropies in rhice . the spatial eccentricity and the flow coefficients ,",
    "e.g. the elliptic flow @xmath94 are found to undergo large fluctuations during the evolution of the system .",
