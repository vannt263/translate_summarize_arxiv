    "with the increase in the capacity of backbone networks , the failure of a single link or node can result in the loss of enormous amounts of information , which may lead to catastrophes , or at least loss of revenue .",
    "network connections are therefore provisioned with the property that they can survive such failures , and hence several techniques have been introduced in the literature .",
    "such techniques either add extra resources , or reserve some of the available network resources as backup circuits , just for the sake of recovery from failures . recovery from failures is also required to be agile in order to minimize the network outage time .",
    "this recovery usually involves two steps : fault diagnosis and location , and rerouting connections .",
    "hence , the optimal network survivability problem is a multi - objective problem in terms of resource efficiency , operation cost , and agility  @xcite .    in network survivability , the four different types of failures that might affect network operations are@xcite :    link failure ,    node failure ,    shared risk link group ( srlg ) failure , and    network control system failure .",
    "henceforth , one needs to design network protection strategies against these types of failures . although the common frequent failures are link failures , node failures sometimes happen due to burned swritch / router , fire , or any other hardware damage .",
    "in addition , the failure might be due to network maintenance .",
    "network coding allows the intermediate nodes not only to forward packets using network scheduling algorithms , but also encode / decode them using algebraic primitive operations , see  @xcite and the references therein . as an application of network coding , data loss because of failures in communication links",
    "can be detected and recovered if the sources are allowed to perform network coding operations .",
    "recently , network protection strategies against multiple link failures using network coding and reduced capacities are proposed in  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we provide a new technique for protecting network failures using _ protection codes _ and _ reduced capacity _ in which the encoding operations are defined over finite fields .",
    "this technique can be deployed at an overlay layer in optical mesh networks , in which detecting failure is an essential task .",
    "the benefits of this approach are that :    it allows receivers to recover the lost data without contacting a third parity or main domain server .",
    "it has less computational complexity and does not require adding extra paths .",
    "all @xmath2 disjoint paths have full capacity except at @xmath1 paths in case of protecting against @xmath1 link failures .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sections  [ sec :",
    "networkmodel ] and [ sec : terminolgoy ] we present the network model and problem definition . in section  [ sec : tfilures ] we provide network protections against @xmath1 link failures .",
    "we present differentiated distributed capacities in section  [ sec : distributedcapacities ] , and demonstrate analysis of protection codes in section  [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "finally , bounds on the finite field size is proved in section  [ sec : boundfeilds ] , and the paper is concluded in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section we introduce the network model and provide the needed assumptions .",
    "the main hypothesis of this network model can be stated as follows .",
    "primary paths carries encoded data . the black points represent various other relay nodes , width=272,height=170 ]    let @xmath3 be a network represented by an abstract graph @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the set of nodes and @xmath6 be set of undirected edges .",
    "let @xmath7 and @xmath8 are sets of independent sources and destinations , respectively .",
    "the set @xmath9 contains the relay nodes , sources , and destinations .",
    "assume for simplicity that @xmath10 , hence the set of sources is equal to the set of receivers .    the node can be a router , switch , or an end terminal depending on the network model @xmath3 and the transmission layer .",
    "@xmath11 is a set of links @xmath12 carrying the data from the sources to the receivers as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : npaths ] .",
    "all connections have the same bandwidth , otherwise a connection with high bandwidth can be divided into multiple connections , each of which has a unit capacity .",
    "there are exactly @xmath2 connections . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that the number of sources is less than or equal to the number of links . a sender with a high capacity",
    "can divide its capacity into multiple unit capacity , each of which has its own link . put differently , @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 , for some integer @xmath16 .",
    "hence we have @xmath17 .",
    "the n connection paths are pairwise link disjoint .",
    "the data from all sources are sent in cycles .",
    "each cycle has a number of time slots @xmath2 .",
    "hence @xmath18 is a value at round time slot @xmath19 in cycle @xmath20 .",
    "the failure on a link @xmath21 may happen due to the network circumstance such as a link replacement , overhead , etc .",
    "we assume that the receiver is able to detect a failure and our protection strategy is able to recover it .    in this model @xmath3 , consider only a single link failure , it is sufficient to apply the encoding and decoding operation over a finite field with two elements , we denote it @xmath22 .",
    "we assume that there is a set of n connections that need to be protected with @xmath23 guaranteed against single and multiple link failures .",
    "we assume that all connections have the same bandwidth , and each link ( one hop or circuit ) has the same bandwidth as a path .",
    "every sender @xmath24 prepares a packet _ @xmath25 _ to send to a receiver @xmath26 .",
    "the packet contains the sender s i d , data @xmath27 , and a round time for every cycle @xmath28 for some integers @xmath20 and @xmath29 .",
    "there are two types of packets :    * plain packets : * packets sent without coding , in which the sender does not need to perform any coding operations .",
    "for example , in case of packets sent without coding , the sender @xmath24 sends the following packet to the receiver @xmath26 . @xmath30    * encoding packets : * packets sent with encoded data , in which the sender @xmath31 sends other sender s data . in this case",
    ", the sender @xmath31 sends the following packet to receiver @xmath32 : @xmath33 where @xmath34 .    in either case",
    "the sender has a full capacity in the connection link @xmath21 .",
    "[ def : capacitylink ] the capacity of a connecting link @xmath21 between @xmath24 and @xmath26 is defined by @xmath35 and the total capacity is given by the summation of all link capacities .",
    "what we mean by an _",
    "active _ link is that the receiver is able to receiver un - encoded signals / messages throughout this link and process them .",
    "clearly , if all links are active then the total capacity is @xmath2 and normalized capacity is @xmath36 . in general the normalized capacity of the network for the active and failed links",
    "is computed by @xmath37    the following definition describes the _ working _ and _ protection _ paths between two network switches as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : npaths ] .",
    "the _ working paths _ on a network with @xmath2 connection paths carry un - encoded traffic under normal operations .",
    "protection paths _ provide an alternate backup path to carry encoded traffic .",
    "a protection scheme ensures that data sent from the sources will reach the receivers in case of failure incidences on the working paths .",
    "in this section we present a network protection strategy against @xmath1 failures in optical networks .",
    "assume the same notations as shown in the previous sections hold .",
    "assume also that the total number of failures are @xmath1 and they happen at arbitrary @xmath1 links .",
    "@xmath38    let @xmath39 , hence we have @xmath40 rounds per cycle .",
    "the encoding operations of nps - t against @xmath1 failures are shown in scheme  ( [ eq : tfailuresscheme ] ) .",
    "we can see that @xmath41 in general is given by    @xmath42    the advantages of nps - t approach is that    * the data is encoded and decoded online , and it will be sent and received in different rounds .",
    "once the receivers detect failures , they are able to obtain a copy of the lost data immediately without delay by querying the neighboring nodes with unbroken working paths . *",
    "the recovery is assured with @xmath23 . since @xmath1 paths will carry encoded data , up to @xmath1 failures can be recovered . * using this strategy , no extra paths are needed .",
    "this will make this approach more suitable for applications , in which adding extra paths is not allowed . * since in real case scenarios , the number of failures is very small in comparison to the number of working paths , the nps - t performs well . *",
    "the encoding operations are linear , and the coefficients of the variables @xmath43 are taken from a finite field with @xmath44 elements .",
    "let @xmath2 be the total number of connections from sources to receivers .",
    "the capacity of nps - t strategy shown in scheme  [ eq : tfailuresscheme ] against @xmath1 path failures is given by @xmath45    the encoding scheme  ( [ eq : tfailuresscheme ] ) is optimal in terms of max capacity .",
    "one can not find a better encoding scheme against @xmath1 link failures rather than providing one protection path against one failure . indeed",
    "@xmath1 protection paths are used to protect @xmath1 link failures and this is shown in scheme  ( [ eq : tfailuresscheme ] ) .",
    "assume that each connection path @xmath21 ( l ) has a unit capacity from a source @xmath24 ( s ) to a receiver @xmath26 ( r ) .",
    "the data sent from the sources s to the receivers r is transmitted in rounds . under nps - t , in every round @xmath46 paths are used to carry new data ( @xmath43 ) , and @xmath1 paths are used to carry protected data units .",
    "there are @xmath1 protection paths .",
    "therefore , to treat all connections fairly , there will be @xmath47 rounds in a cycle , and in each round the capacity is given by n - t .",
    "we consider the case in which all symbols @xmath43 belong to the same round .",
    "the first t sources transmit the first encoded data units @xmath48 , and in the second round , the next @xmath1 sources transmit @xmath49 , and so on .",
    "all sources @xmath7 and receivers @xmath8 must keep track of the round numbers .",
    "let @xmath50 and @xmath51 be the i d and data initiated by the source @xmath24 .",
    "assume the round time @xmath19 in cycle @xmath20 is given by @xmath52 .",
    "then the source @xmath24 will send @xmath53 on the working path which includes @xmath54 also , the source @xmath31 , that transmits on a protection path , will send a packet @xmath55 : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is defined in  ( [ eq : y_nps - t ] ) . hence the protection paths are used to protect the data transmitted in round @xmath29 , which are included in the @xmath58 data units .",
    "so , we have a system of @xmath1 independent equations at each round time that will be used to recover at most @xmath1 unknown variables .",
    "the strategy nps - t is a generalization of protecting against a single path failure shown in the previous section in which @xmath1 protection paths are used instead of one protection path in case of one failure .",
    "we also notice that most of the network operations suffer from one and two path failures  @xcite .",
    "one way to select the coefficients @xmath59 s in each round such that we have a system of @xmath1 linearly independent equations is by using the matrix h shown in  ( [ bch : parity ] ) .",
    "let @xmath60 be the order of a finite field , and @xmath61 be the root of unity .",
    "then we can use this matrix to define the coefficients of the senders as : @xmath62.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have the following assumptions about the encoding operations .",
    "clearly if we have one failure @xmath63 , then all coefficients will be one .",
    "the first sender will always choose the unit value .",
    "if we assume @xmath1 failures , then the @xmath64 equations are written as : @xmath65    this equation gives the general theme to choose the coefficients at any particular round in any cycle .",
    "however , the encoded data @xmath66 s are defined as shown in equation  ( [ eq : tcofficients ] ) . in other words , for the first round in cycle one , the coefficients of the plain data @xmath67 are set to zero .",
    "we know that the coefficients @xmath68 are elements of a finite field , hence the inverses of these elements exist and they are unique .",
    "once a node fails which causes @xmath1 data units to be lost , and once the receivers receive @xmath1 linearly independent equations , they can linearly solve these equations to obtain the unknown t data units .",
    "at one particular cycle j , we have three cases for the failures    all t link failures happened in the working paths , i.e. the working paths have failed to convey the messages @xmath27 in round @xmath29 . in this case",
    ", @xmath46 equations will be received , @xmath1 of which are linear combinations of @xmath46 data units , and the remaining @xmath69 are explicit @xmath70 data units , for a total of @xmath46 equations in @xmath46 data units . in this case any t equations ( packets ) of the t encoded packets can be used to recover the lost data .",
    "all t link failures happened in the protection paths . in this case , the exact remaining n - t packets are working paths and they do not experience any failures .",
    "therefore , no recovery operations are needed .",
    "the third case is that the failure might happen in some working and protection paths simultaneously in one particular round in a cycle .",
    "the recover can be done using any t protection paths as shown in case i.",
    "in this section we derive lower and upper bound on the alphabet size required for the encoding and decoding operations . in the proposed schemes we assume that direction connections exist between the senders and receivers , which the information can be exchanged with neglected cost .",
    "the first result shows that the alphabet size required must be greater than the number of connections that carry unencoded data .",
    "let @xmath2 be the number of connections in the network model @xmath3 , then the receivers are able to decode the encoded messages over @xmath71 and will recover from @xmath72 path failures if @xmath73 also , if @xmath74 , then @xmath75 .",
    "the binary field is sufficient in case of a single path failure .",
    "we will prove the lower bound by construction .",
    "assume a nps - t at one particular time @xmath76 in the round @xmath29 in a certain cycle @xmath20 .",
    "the protection code of nps - t against @xmath1 path failures is given in  [ bch : parity ] .    without loss of generality , the interpretation of scheme  ( [ bch : parity ] ) is as follows :    the columns correspond to the senders @xmath7 and rows correspond to t encoded data @xmath64 .",
    "the first row corresponds to @xmath77 if we assume the first round in cycle one .",
    "furthermore , every row represents the coefficients of every senders at a particular round .",
    "the column @xmath78 represents the coefficients of the sender @xmath24 through all protection paths @xmath79 .",
    "any element @xmath80 appears once in a column and row , except in the follow column and first row , where all elements are one s .",
    "all columns ( rows ) are linearly independent .    due to the fact that the t failures might occur at any t working paths of @xmath81",
    ", then we can not predict the t protection paths as well .",
    "this means that t out of the n columns do not participate in the encoding coefficients , because t paths will carry encoded data .",
    "we notice that removing any @xmath1 out of the @xmath2 columns in scheme  ( [ bch : parity ] ) will result to @xmath46 linearly independent columns .",
    "therefore the smallest finite field that satisfies this condition must have @xmath82 elements .",
    "the upper bound comes from the case of no failures , hence @xmath83 .",
    "assume q is a prime power , then the result follows .",
    "if @xmath84 , then in general the previous bound can be stated as @xmath85 the following result shows the maximum admissible paths , which can suffer from failures , and the decoding operations can be achieved successfully .",
    "let @xmath2 and @xmath1 be the number of connections and failures in the network model @xmath3 , then we have @xmath86 .",
    "the proof is a direct consequence and from the fact that the protection paths must be less than or equal to the number of working paths .",
    "this lemma shows that one can not provide protection paths better than duplicating the number of working paths .",
    "in this section we develop network protection strategy where some connection paths have high priorities ( less bandwidth , high demand ) .",
    "let @xmath2 be the set of available connections ( disjoint paths from sources to receivers ) .",
    "let @xmath40 be the set of rounds in every cycle .",
    "in the previous strategies ( nps - t ) we assumed that all connection paths have the same priority demand and working capacities . this might be the real case scenario .",
    "connections that carry applications with multimedia traffic have high priority than applications that carry data traffic .",
    "therefore , it is required to design network protection strategies based on the traffic and sender priorities .",
    "consider that available working connections @xmath2 may use their bandwidth assignments in asymmetric ways . some connections are less demanding in terms of bandwidth requirements than other connections that require full capacity frequently .",
    "therefore connections with less demanding can transmit more protection packets , while other connections demand more bandwidth , and can therefore transmit fewer protection packets throughout transmission rounds .",
    "let @xmath40 be the number of rounds and @xmath87 be the time of transmission in a cycle @xmath20 at round @xmath78 .",
    "for a particular cycle @xmath78 , let @xmath1 be the number of protection paths against @xmath1 failures that might affect the working paths .",
