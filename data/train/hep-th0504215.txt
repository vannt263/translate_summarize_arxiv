    "lorentz invariance is possibly one of the most fundamental symmetries of nature .",
    "it is theoretically sound , it has been extensively tested , and so far no clear cut experimental evidence has emerged to bridge its validity ( see e.g. refs .",
    "it is therefore no surprise that most theories of gravity encompass this symmetry , and little attention has been paid in understanding the implications of the breaking of lorentz invariance in this context .",
    "there is , however , a window of opportunity for fiddling with a less stringent approach : as for gauge symmetries in field theory , many relevant after effects can arise if one assumes a spontaneous breaking of lorentz invariance @xcite . in the context of gravity , the breaking of lorentz invariance can be implemented if a vector field ruled by a potential exhibiting a minimum rolls to its vacuum expectation value ( _ vev _ ) , in the fashion of the higgs mechanism @xcite .",
    "this `` bumblebee '' vector thus acquires an explicit ( four - dimensional ) orientation , and preferred - frame effects may arise .",
    "the possibility of violation of the this fundamental symmetry has been widely discussed in the recent literature ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . indeed , string / mtheory allow for a spontaneous breaking of lorentz symmetry , due to the existence of non - trivial solutions in string field theory @xcite , loop quantum gravity @xcite , quantum gravity inspired spacetime foam scenarios @xcite and noncommutative field theories @xcite . also , lsb could result from spacetime variation of fundamental coupling constants @xcite .",
    "experimental tests of this symmetry breaking could be achieved , for instance , in ultra - high energy cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "efforts to quantify an hypothetical breaking of lorentz invariance have been mainly concerned with the phenomenology of such spontaneous lorentz symmetry breaking ( lsb ) in particle physics .",
    "only recently its implications for gravity have been more thoroughly explored @xcite . in that work , the framework for the lsb gravity model is set up , developing the action and using the _ vielbein _ formalism .    in this study , we focus on the consequences of such scenario . for this , one assumes three relevant cases : the bumblebee field acquiring a purely radial _ vev",
    "_ , a mixed radial and temporal _ vev _ and a mixed axial and temporal _",
    "vev_. for prompt comparison with experimental tests , we shall write our results in terms of the ppn parameters , when possible .",
    "the action of the bumblebee model is written as    s & = & d^4 [ 2 ( r + b^b^r _ ) + & - & 1 4 b^ b _ - v(b^b_b^2 ) ]  ,    where @xmath0 , @xmath1 is a real coupling constant and @xmath2 is a real positive constant . the potential @xmath3 driving lorentz and/or cpt violation can be chosen to have a minimum at @xmath4 .",
    "in this section we develop a method to obtain the exact solution for the purely radial lsb . for this , we assume a static , spherically symmetric spacetime , with a metric @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are functions of @xmath8 .",
    "also , we admit that the vector field @xmath9 has relaxed onto its expectation value @xmath10 . it is imposed that @xmath11 .",
    "this enables us to calculate @xmath10 , using the affine connection derived from the metric @xmath12 ; for this , and since the only non trivial covariant derivative is with respect to the radial coordinate , it is assumed that @xmath13 .",
    "hence , from    d_b_= _ b_- ^ _",
    "b_= 0  ,    follows that    b(r ) = ^-1/2 b_0 e^  ,    where the @xmath14 is introduced for later convenience .",
    "it can be immediately understood that , as expected , @xmath15 is constant .",
    "the action can be thus written as    s_s = d^4 x _ s  ,    where the subscript @xmath16 stands for the spatial quantities . with the assumed metric",
    ", the determinant is given by @xmath17 ; the scalar curvature and the relevant ricci tensor non - vanishing component are given by    r = 2 r^2  ,   r_rr = 2  r  ,    where the prime stands for derivative with respect to @xmath8 and we have integrated over the angular dependence .",

    "e^-2 r  ,    where @xmath18 is the ( contravariant ) radial component of @xmath10 .",
    "we now introduce the field redefinition @xmath19 , so that     = 2  e^-2 r^2 - 2 r  ,    and thus    & = & 2 + r   , + r & = & 2 ( 3 + r  )  , + ( b^r)^2 r_rr & = & b_0 ^ 2 ( 2 + r  )  .",

    "one can write    g_rr & = & ( 1 - 2 g_l m r r^l ) ^-1  , + g_00 & = & -1 + 2 g_l m r r^l  , [ metric ]    where @xmath23 has dimensions @xmath24",

    "the @xmath28 limit yields @xmath29 and the usual geometrical mass , @xmath30 , with dimensions of lenght . from now on we express all results in terms of @xmath31 . the event horizon condition is given by    g_00 = -1 + 2 m r r r_0^l = 0  ,    thus @xmath32 .",

    "thus , an axial lsb gravity model admits new black hole solutions whose singularity is well protected within a horizon of radius @xmath39 .",
    "one expects a hawking temperature given by    t = k_b 1 4 r_s = ( 2 m r_0 ^ -l)^-l/(1-l ) t_0 ( 2 m r_0 ^ -l)^-l t_0  ,    where @xmath40 is the usual hawking temperature , which is recovered in the limit @xmath35 .    of course , this exact solution does not allow for a ppn expansion , as the obtained metric",

    "this states that the effects of a radial lsb , probed at a distance @xmath27 from the source , can be interpreted as due to a yukawa potential of coupling strength @xmath45 and range @xmath44 .",
    "the negative sign of the coupling shows that the radial lsb yields a `` repulsive '' component ( for @xmath47 ) , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) .    notice that this identification of the lsb effect with a yukawa potential constraints the length @xmath48 to be equal to the distance @xmath27 at which one tests deviations from the inverse square law .",
    "this is not the case with a `` true '' yukawa perturbation , where each test of gravity at a distance @xmath27 yields an allowed range for both @xmath49 and @xmath48 ( although , of course , the test is sensible to deviations only at a scale @xmath48 close to @xmath27 .",
    "hence , to obtain a bound on @xmath50 one must look at the allowed value of @xmath49 for the fixed @xmath51 at which an experiment is carried out .",
    "the most stringent bound is derived from planetary tests to kepler s law , with venus yielding @xmath52 and @xmath53 radial / temporal lsb -------------------    we consider now the mixed radial and temporal lorentz symmetry breaking . as",

    "hence , no clear connection can be derived to link @xmath132 with @xmath177 and @xmath178 .    however , the measured value of @xmath132 should be of the same order of magnitude as the average of @xmath177 and @xmath178 , integrated over one orbit :    -1 ( _ 1 + _ 2 ) - 1 cos^2 ( 1-e^2 )  ,    where @xmath179 is the orbit eccentricity . for low values of @xmath179 such as those found in the solar system ,",

    "in this study we have obtained the solutions of a gravity model coupled to a vector field where lorentz symmetry is spontaneously broken . we have analyzed three cases : purely radial , temporal / radial and temporal / axial lsb .    in the first case , we have found a new black hole solution ; we showed that , as in the standard scenario , this solution has a removable singularity at a horizon of radius @xmath187 , which is slightly perturbed with respect to the usual scharzschild radius @xmath188 .",
    "this horizon has an associated hawking temperature of @xmath189 , and protects a real singularity at @xmath38 .",
    "deviations from kepler s law yield @xmath190 .",
    "the temporal / radial case yields a slightly perturbed metric which leads to ppn parameters @xmath191 and @xmath192 , directly proportional to the strength of the induced effect ( given by @xmath99 and @xmath193 ) .",
    "unfortunately , since @xmath99 and @xmath123 are integration constants , one can not constrain the physical parameters from the observed limits on the ppn parameters .",
    "also , analogously to rosen s bimetric theory , one can obtain the ppn parameter @xmath194 , where @xmath1 is the distance to the central body and @xmath83 and @xmath84 rule the temporal and radial components of the vector field _ vev_.    in the temporal / axial case one gets , as expected , a breakdown of isotropy , and hence a standard ppn analysis is not feasible .",
    "however , we have defined the direction - dependent `` ppn '' parameters @xmath195 and @xmath196 ( considering the lsb occurs in the direction of @xmath197 ) .",
    "naturally , @xmath198 . a crude estimative of the measurable ppn parameter @xmath132 yields @xmath199 , where @xmath179 is the orbit s eccentricity .",
    "this final case requires further study , as its effects can not be properly accounted for an isotropic formalism such as the parametrized post - newtonian one .",
