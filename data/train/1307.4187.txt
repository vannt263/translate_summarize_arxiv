    "while measurements of synchrotron polarization of the radio and optical emission from relativistic jet sources ( blazars , radio galaxies , gamma - ray bursts ) have become a standard way of assessing the degree of order and direction of magnetic fields , the polarization of high - energy ( x - ray and @xmath0-ray ) emission has so far remained largely unexplored .",

    "200  kev energy band @xcite .",
    "estimates of the minimum detectable degree of polarization for most of these instruments range around 10  % for moderately bright x - ray sources .",
    "unfortunately , the gravity and extreme magnetism smex ( gems ; 2  10  kev ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was recently cancelled by nasa , in spite of being rather far along in its developing phase .",
    "it has also been suggested that the large area telescope ( lat ) on - board the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope may be able to detect @xmath0-ray polarization in the energy range @xmath2  200  mev when considering pair - conversion events occurring in the silicon layers of the detector , by taking advantage of the polarization - dependent direction of motion of the electron - positron pairs produced in the @xmath0-ray  pair conversion process @xcite . for bright @xmath0-ray sources , degrees of polarization down to @xmath3",
    "% may be detectable .",
    "on the theory side , the general formalism for calculating x - ray and @xmath0-ray polarization has been well developed .",
    "it is well - known that linear polarization arises from synchrotron radiation of relativistic charged particles in ordered magnetic fields , while compton scattering off relativistic electrons will reduce the degree of polarization of the target photon field , without entirely destroying it .",
    "compton scattering of unpolarized target photon fields by isotropic distributions of electrons ( and positrons ) will always result in un - polarized compton emission .",
    "the well - known formalism for calculating synchrotron polarization can be found , e.g. , in the text book by @xcite . a formalism for evaluating the polarization of compton scattered radiation in the thomson regime",
    "was developed by @xcite and applied specifically to synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission by @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite provided a general monte - carlo based framework for the evaluation of polarization signatures in relativistic environments in both thomson and klein - nishina regimes , verifying that the expressions of @xcite and @xcite are valid in the thomson regime .",
    "however , while the general framework for the evaluation of polarization signatures from different radiation mechanisms exists , it has so far not been applied to realistic representations of the high - energy emission from relativistic jets of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , which are the most numerous source class in the _",
    "fermi_-lat energy range .",
    "the @xmath0-ray brightest agn detected by _",
    "fermi_-lat are blazars , i.e. , radio - loud ( jet - dominated ) agn in which the jet points at a small angle with respect to our line of sight .",
    "example results for the synchrotron and ssc polarization in blazar jets have been presented by @xcite , indicating that substantial ( @xmath4  % ) polarization may result from these radiation mechanisms in the case of perfectly ordered magnetic fields .",
    "however , his calculations were restricted to pure power - law electron spectra and only a very specific choice of parameters , with no direct connection to the observed spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of blazars .",
    "the seds of blazars are dominated by non - thermal emission across the entire electromagnetic spectrum , with two broad components .",
    "depending on the peak frequency of the low - frequency component ( generally agreed to be synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons ) , they are sub - divided between low - synchrotron - peaked ( lsp ) blazars ( consisting of flat - spectrum radio quasars [ fsrqs ] and low - frequency peaked bl  lac objects [ lbls ] ) , intermediate - synchrotron - peaked ( isp ) blazars ( generally intermediate bl  lac objects [ ibls ] ) , and high - synchrotron - peaked ( hsp ) blazars ( which are exclusively high - frequency - peaked bl  lac objects [ hbls ] ) .",
    "the mechanism producing the high - energy ( x - ray through @xmath0-ray ) emission in blazars is still under debate .",
    "both leptonic and hadronic models are currently still viable and are generally able to produce acceptable fits to the seds of most blazars ( for a review of blazar emission models see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "additional information , such as variability or polarization , is therefore needed to distinguish between leptonic and hadronic emission scenarios .    in this paper",

    "this configuration produces the maximum possible degree of polarization both for synchrotron and ssc emission .",
    "thus , our results represent upper limits to the actually expected polarization from emission regions with partially dis - ordered magnetic fields .",
    "as we will elaborate in section [ diagnostics ] , the observed degree of polarization in frequency ranges in the sed that can be confidently ascribed to synchrotron radiation can then be used to re - normalize our results to find the actually expected degree of x - ray and @xmath0-ray polarization .",
    "all particle distributions , on which we base our calculations , are assumed to be isotropic in the co - moving frame of the emission region , as is routinely done in blazar emission models .",
    "this is justified by very efficient pitch - angle scattering on small - scale magnetic turbulence ( with small amplitudes @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the ordered background magnetic field ) which is expected to be present in the highly relativistic blazar environment . for a more detailed discussion of this aspect ,",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .    in general terms",

    "our calculations properly account for the mass difference in the case of proton synchrotron ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is well known that a power - law spectrum of electrons @xmath17 ( producing a power - law synchrotron radiation spectrum @xmath18 with @xmath19 ) will result in a polarization degree of @xcite    @xmath20    for compton scattering , we follow the formalism of @xcite . we only need to calculate the polarization for ssc emission since x - ray and @xmath0-ray emission from compton scatering of radiation fields external to the @xmath0-ray emission region ( ec = external compton ) is expected to be unpolarized , and can simply be added as a radiation component with @xmath21 .",
    "since the expressions for ssc polarization given by @xcite are only valid in the thomson regime , we must first confirm their validity in the considered energy range of @xmath22  kev ",

    "we apply the polarization code described above to both leptonic and hadronic , stationary single - zone models of fermi - detected blazars , as described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the blazar models have been used to produce sed fits to a number of blazars of all sub - classes .",
    "the particle distributions and other model parameters ( in particular , the magnetic field b ) required by the models to reproduce an individual blazar s sed are then used to evaluate the photon - energy - dependent degree of polarization with the code described here .    in the leptonic blazar model , the high energy component of the sed has contributions from synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) and external compton ( ec ) radiation ,",
    "whose seed photons are from direct accretion disk emission , accretion disk emission reprocessed by the broad line region ( blr ) and an isotropic external radiation field . since the ec high - energy emission is expected to be un - polarized , we only need to evaluate the synchrotron and ssc polarization , and we obtain the total polarization degree in the leptonic model as @xmath62    in the hadronic model , the high - energy emission consists primarily of contributions from proton synchrotron emission and synchrotron emission from secondary pairs produced in cascade processes initiated by photo - pion production . at lower energies , especially in the x - ray range ,",
    "the ssc emission of the primary electrons ( primarily responsible for the low - frequency synchrotron peak ) may also make a non - negligible contribution .",
    "this model only evaluates the spectra of the final decay products of the photo - pion production , neglecting the emission from intermediate decay products such as muons .",
    "thus , the polarization is calculated taking into account contributions from synchrotron emissions of primary electrons and protons and from secondary electron - positron pairs , as well as ssc from primary electrons .",
    "we point out that , even if muon and pion synchrotron emission makes a substantial contribution to the @xmath0-ray emission , such a component would be expected to be equally highly polarized as the proton and pair synchrotron emission considered in the model .",
    "thus , a variant of the hadronic model that produces the same sed , but including non - negligible contributions from muon and pion synchrotron emission , is expected to yield very similar polarization signatures as calculated here .",
    "even though the target ( synchrotron ) photon field for photopair and photopion production is polarized in the configuration considered here , our code neglects any potential dependence of the relevant p@xmath0 cross sections on the polarization of the target photon field , as such dependence is very poorly understood and due to the assumed isotropy of the proton distribution , its effects are expected to be negligible .",
    "we have applied the method of calculating the frequency - dependent degree of polarization to a substantial number of fermi - detected fsrqs , lbls , ibls , and hbls .",
    "we have evaluated the degree of polarization between 0.1  kev and 500  mev , encompassing the energy range in which x - ray polarimeters and _ fermi_-lat have realistic prospects of measuring high - energy polarization .",
    "we remind the reader that the results shown here are upper limits to the polarization , assuming a perfectly ordered magnetic field perpendicular to the line of sight ( in the co - moving frame of the emission region ) .",

    "* lower panels ) and the photon - energy - dependent degree of polarization ( top panels ) throughout the x - ray and @xmath0-ray regime , for two representative fsrqs . in the case of fsrqs , the synchrotron emission from electrons ( i.e. , primary electrons in the hadronic model ) does generally not contribute appreciably in the x - ray ( or higher - energy ) range .",
    "in leptonic models , the high - energy emission is typically dominated by ssc throughout the x - ray regime , while at @xmath0-ray energies , ec tends to dominate . in hadronic models ,",
    "the high - energy emission of lsp blazars is typically well reproduced by models strongly dominated by proton synchrotron emission .    the first , obvious result to be seen in fig .",
    "[ fsrqpol ] is that leptonic models predict systematically lower degrees of polarization than ( synchrotron - dominated ) hadronic models .",

    "@xmath65  3 ) , with the polarization gradually increasing due to the generally convex shape of the @xmath0-ray sed ( increasing @xmath55 implying increasing @xmath9 ) .",
    "furthermore , due to the transition from ssc to ec from the x - ray to the @xmath0-ray regime in leptonic models , the degree of polarization is expected to decrease rapidly with photon energy , and vanish in the _ fermi_-lat energy range .",

    "figure [ lblpol ] shows two such examples . in that case , the degree of x - ray polarization predicted by hadronic models is substantially lower than in the fsrq case and only slightly higher than predicted by leptonic models . in some cases",

    "the same drastic difference between the predicted degrees of polarization persists : hadronic models predict up to @xmath66  75  % maximum @xmath0-ray polarization , with substantially lower @xmath0-ray polarization predicted by leptonic models .",

    ", the x - ray regime often covers the transition region from synchrotron ( i.e. , primary electron - synchrotron in hadronic models ) emission to compton emission in leptonic models and proton - induced emission in hadronic models .",
    "therefore , at soft x - ray energies , both leptonic and hadronic models can exhibit very high degrees of polarization , dominated by the steep high - energy tail of the low - frequency synchrotron component .",
    "leptonic models reproduce the hard x - ray through @xmath0-ray emission typically with ssc dominated emission , although in the high - energy @xmath0-ray regime ( @xmath67  mev ) , an additional ec component is often required ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "consequently , the degree of polarization is expected to decrease rapidly with energy to maximum values of typically @xmath2  % throughout the hard x - ray to soft @xmath0-ray band , and may decrease even further if the he @xmath0-ray emission is ec dominated .",
    "hadronic models often require contributions from proton - synchrotron , pair synchrotron , and primary - electron ssc emission .",
    "this ssc contribution slightly lowers the hard x - ray through soft @xmath0-ray polarization compared to purely synchrotron - dominated emission ( as in most lsps ) , but still predicts substantially higher degrees of hard x - ray and @xmath0-ray polarization compared to leptonic models .",
    "two examples of sed fits and corresponding maximum polarization in the case of hbls are shown in figure [ hblpol ] . the data and sed fits for rbs  0413 are from @xcite ; those for rx j0648.7 + 1516 are from @xcite . in hbls ,",
    "the x - ray emission ( at least below a few 10s of kev ) is typically strongly dominated by electron - synchrotron radiation , in both leptonic and hadronic models .",
    "therefore , both models make essentially identical predictions of high maximum polarization throughout the x - ray regime . in leptonic models ,",
    "the @xmath0-ray emission of hbls is often well represented by pure ssc emission , although a few cases also require additional ( or even dominant ) contributions from ec ( see the case of rx j0648.7 + 1516 in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ hblpol ] for one such example ; * ? ? ?",
    "combined with the very low soft @xmath0-ray fluxes predicted by such models , @xmath0-ray polarization from hbls in leptonic models is not expected to be detectable . in hadronic models , the @xmath0-ray emission of hbls is usually well represented by proton - synchrotron dominated scenarios , predicting a high level of maximum polarization .",
    "as pointed out , the calculations presented here assume a perfectly ordered magnetic field and therefore only represent upper limits to the possible degree of polarization actually observed .",
    "therefore , in the case of a non - detection of x - ray and @xmath0-ray polarization , it would seem difficult to establish whether this is simply due to an un - ordered magnetic field , or would actually favour a leptonic emission mechanism .",
    "however , this ambiguity may be lifted if the degree of polarization is determined in energy ranges of the sed that can be confidently ascribed to synchrotron emission .    in the case of fsrqs and lbls",
    ", it is generally agreed that the near infrared ( nir )  optical emission is dominated by synchrotron radiation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "optical polarimetry will therefore allow one to determine the degree of order / disorder of the magnetic field in the emission region by comparing the measured @xmath68 with the theoretical maximum given by eq .",
    "( [ pipowerlaw ] ) , since the spectral index @xmath69 of the nir  optical synchrotron spectrum is easily measured . due to the @xmath70 dependence of faraday rotation , the effects of faraday depolarization are negligible at optical wavelengths , so that the polarization measured here does , indeed , provide a realistic estimate of the degree of order of the magnetic field .",
    "our results , as illustrated in figures [ fsrqpol ] and [ lblpol ] may then be re - scaled by that factor to arrive at a realistic prediction of the expected degree of x - ray and @xmath0-ray polarization and to determine whether the expected degree of polarization ( especially in hadronic models ) is within the capabilities of x - ray polarimeters and _ fermi_-lat .",

    "consequently , a similar degree of x - ray and @xmath0-ray polarization of @xmath74  20  % may be expected for quasars in the case of hadronic emission , which is at the borderline of the capabilities of existing polarimeters .    in the case of ibls and hbls , where the x - rays ( in ibls only the soft x - rays ) are dominated by synchrotron emission , the degree of order / disorder of the magnetic field",
    "may be determined directly from x - ray polarimetry by compmaring the measured @xmath75 to the theoretical maximum from synchrotron polarization , as evaluated by our calculations . as in the case of fsrqs",
    ", the resulting re - scaling factor may be used to assess whether the expected @xmath0-ray polarization is within the capabilities of _ fermi_-lat to determine polarization , and if so , hadronic emission is expected to reveal itself through a high degree of polarizaiton .",
    "we should point out here that hbls typically exhibit very hard photon spectra in the _ fermi_-lat range , with very low photon fluxes below 200  mev .",
    "the detection of @xmath0-ray polarization in hbls therefore seems infeasible in the near future .",
    "it has been suggested that hbls may be prime targets for x - ray polarimeters since they tend to be the brightest blazars in x - rays .",
    "however , unfortunately , leptonic and hadronic models agree on the interpretation of the x - ray emission of hbls as due to electron synchrotron radiation , and therefore make identical predictions for the x - ray polarization .",
    "thus , x - ray polarimetry of hbls is not expected to aid in distinguishing leptonic from hadronic emission , given current @xmath0-ray polarimetry capabilities .",
    "such diagnostics would require substantially increased sensitivity and/or @xmath0-ray polarimetry at energies much above 200  mev .",
    "we have presented calculations of the maximum achievable degree of x - ray and @xmath0-ray polarization expected in leptonic and hadronic one - zone models for blazars .",
    "we generally find that hadronic models predict very high degrees of maximum polarization for all classes of blazars , since the entire sed is dominated by synchrotron processes .",
    "even when accounting for the expected deviations from perfectly ordered magnetic fields , the predicted degree of polarization may be within the capabilities of current x - ray and @xmath0-ray polarimeters .",
    "while in lsps , the degree of polarization is expected to continually increase with increasing photon energy , it is expected to remain roughly constant throughout the x - ray and @xmath0-ray regimes for isps and hsps . depending on the type of blazar ( and , hence , the contribution that synchrotron emission makes to the x - ray emission ) , leptonic models predict ( a ) moderate x - ray polarization , but vanishing @xmath0-ray polarization for lsps blazars , ( b ) high soft x - ray polarization , rapidly decreasing with photon energy for isps , and ( c ) high x - ray polarization and low @xmath1  mev @xmath0-ray polarization ( though increasing towards higher energies beyond 200  mev ) for hsps .",
    "we have outlined a method , based on optical , x - ray and @xmath0-ray polarimetry that may allow us to confidently distinguish between leptonic and hadronic x - ray and @xmath0-ray emission in lsp and isp blazars .",

    "fermi_-lat , it is unlikely that x - ray polarimetry of hbls will aid in distinguishing leptonic from hadronic emission . due to the prospect of measuring the degree of order / disorder of the magnetic field in isps through a comparison of x - ray polarimetry with our synchrotron predictions , they might be the best candidates to identify hadronic processes .",
    "these objects will allow us to apply the method described above directly , without relying on optical / nir measurements , and - unlike in hsps - a measurement of the expected @xmath0-ray polarization may be feasible using fermi lat or upcoming experiments .    an important aspect to point out",
    "is that high - energy polarization will not be affected by faraday rotation due to the @xmath70 dependence of this effect . while at radio wavelengths , faraday rotation often substantially alters not only the orientation of the polarization direction , but may also lead to faraday depolarization , this effect can be ignored in x - rays and @xmath0-rays , thus revealing the true , intrinsic degree of order of the magnetic field and its directionality .",
    "alternative ways of distinguishing leptonic from hadronic emission scenarios for blazars rely on the potential detectability of neutrino emission expected in hadronic models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and characteristic variability signatures , in particular uncorrelated synchrotron and high - energy variability , which is difficult to explain in leptonic models , but may result more naturally in hadronic ones @xcite .",
    "however , given the sensitivity of current and currently planned neutrino detectors , it is unclear whether neutrino signals from blazars can be detected in the forseeable future .",
    "furthermore , also leptonic model interpretations have been suggested to explain uncorrelated synchrotron ( optical  x - ray ) and @xmath0-ray variability patterns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so that even such uncorrelated variability can not be considered a unique diagnostic for hadronic emission .    finally , we point out that our method is not limited to blazars , but may be applied to a large variety of x - ray and @xmath0-ray sources as long as ssc emission is produced in the thomson regime",
