    "in @xcite , christopher hardin and alan taylor present a remarkable consequence of the axiom of choice .",
    "consider an arbitrary set @xmath0 and a function @xmath1 .",
    "we think of the domain of @xmath2 as representing time , and for each @xmath3 , we think of @xmath4 as the state of some system at time @xmath5 .",
    "the question hardin and taylor address is whether or not it is possible to predict the state of the system from its past behavior . in other words",
    ", can we predict @xmath4 from @xmath6 ? if there is no restriction on the function @xmath2",
    ", then it seems that @xmath6 gives us no information about @xmath4 , and therefore it is hard to see how such a prediction could be possible .",
    "nevertheless , using the axiom of choice , hardin and taylor produce a prediction strategy with the property that for every function @xmath2 , the prediction is correct for all but countably many values of @xmath5",
    ".    it may be helpful to imagine that at each time @xmath5 there is an agent who is making the prediction of @xmath4 .",
    "each agent can see the past but not the present or future , so the agent at @xmath5 knows @xmath6 but no other values of @xmath2 .",
    "hardin and taylor make an extensive study of the predictions that can be made by agents in this and similar situations in their book @xcite .",
    "one idea considered by hardin and taylor is the possibility that the agents can see the past but do nt know what time it is  in other words , the agent at time @xmath5 knows the value of @xmath7 for every @xmath8 , but does nt know the value of @xmath5 .",
    "they define a prediction strategy to be _ anonymous _ if it can be used by agents whose knowledge is restricted in this way . and",
    "they show that even with this restriction on the knowledge of the agents , there is a prediction strategy that guarantees that for every function @xmath2 , all but countably many agents are correct .    in this paper",
    "we consider several variations on the notion of anonymity .",
    "what if the agents not only do nt know what time it is , they also do nt know the rate at which time passes ?",
    "what if each agent knows the order of past events , but nothing about the length of time between events ?",
    "we will see that in some cases the agents are still able to perform well , with only countably many making incorrect predictions , while in other cases they do very badly , with only countably many making correct predictions .",
    "to state our results formally , we will need some definitions .",
    "let @xmath9 denote the set of all functions from @xmath10 to @xmath0 .",
    "each such function represents a possible time evolution of the system under study . following hardin and taylor , we call such functions _",
    "scenarios_. given a scenario @xmath2 , the predictions made by all of the agents could be thought of as determining another scenario , which we will denote @xmath11 .",
    "thus , @xmath12 , and for any time @xmath3 , @xmath13 denotes the prediction of @xmath4 made by the agent at time @xmath5 under the scenario @xmath2 .",
    "since the agent at @xmath5 can see only the past , scenarios @xmath2 and @xmath14 will be indistinguishable to him if @xmath15 , and therefore his predictions in these scenarios should be the same .",
    "we therefore make the following definition .    a function @xmath16 is called a _ predictor",
    "_ if it has the property that for all functions @xmath17 and all @xmath3 , if @xmath15 then @xmath18 .",
    "we say that the agent at @xmath5 _ guesses correctly _ if his prediction of the value of @xmath4 is correct  that is , if @xmath19 . otherwise , agent @xmath5 _ guesses incorrectly_. we can now state hardin and taylor s main result from @xcite .",
    "[ thm : ht ] there is a predictor @xmath20 such that for every scenario @xmath2 , only countably many agents guess incorrectly ; in other words , @xmath21 is countable .",
    "the details of the proof can be found in @xcite , but the idea is simple . using the axiom of choice , we can let @xmath22 be a well ordering of @xmath9 .",
    "now for any @xmath23 and any @xmath3 , let @xmath24_x = \\{g \\in { } ^\\mathbb{r}s : f \\upharpoonright ( -\\infty , x ) = g \\upharpoonright ( -\\infty , x)\\}$ ] , and let @xmath25 be the @xmath22-least element of @xmath24_x$ ] .",
    "in other words , @xmath25 is the least scenario that is consistent with the information available to the agent at time @xmath5",
    ". let @xmath26 .",
    "hardin and taylor show that @xmath21 is well ordered ( by the usual ordering on @xmath10 ) , and any well ordered subset of @xmath10 is countable .",
    "( to see why a well ordered set @xmath27 must be countable , define a one - to - one function @xmath28 by letting @xmath29 be a rational number larger than @xmath5 but smaller than the next element of @xmath30 , if there is one . ) thus , with this predictor , only countably many agents guess incorrectly .",
    "next we present hardin and taylor s definition of anonymity .",
    "suppose that @xmath2 is a scenario , and define another scenario @xmath14 by the equation @xmath31 , for some constant @xmath32 .",
    "in other words , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the function @xmath35 . we will call @xmath34 a _ shift function_. we could think of @xmath14 as the scenario that represents precisely the same time evolution of the system as @xmath2 , but shifted in time by @xmath32 units . now consider agents at times @xmath5 and @xmath36 who can see the past , but who do nt know where they are located in time . for any @xmath37",
    ", we have @xmath38 this means that the past from the point of view of the agent at @xmath5 in scenario @xmath14 looks exactly the same as the past from the point of view of the agent at @xmath36 in scenario @xmath2 .",
    "we would therefore expect these agents to make the same predictions .",
    "in other words , we would expect @xmath39 , or equivalently @xmath40 .",
    "this motivates hardin and taylor s definition of anonymity .",
    "a predictor @xmath20 is _ anonymous _ if for every scenario @xmath2 and every real number @xmath32 , @xmath41    anonymity of a predictor can be thought of as a sort of invariance under shifts .",
    "this suggests a natural generalization of the notion of anonymity ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath42 be a family of functions from @xmath10 to @xmath10 .",
    "a predictor @xmath20 is",
    "_ @xmath42-anonymous _",
    "if for every scenario @xmath2 and every @xmath43 , @xmath44    thus , anonymity is just @xmath45-anonymity , where @xmath45 is the family of shift functions .",
    "but there are other families of functions that we might use instead : @xmath46 if @xmath2 is a scenario and @xmath47 , then @xmath48 is a scenario that is the same as @xmath2 , except that events have been shifted in time , and also the rate at which events happen has been changed .",
    "thus , a @xmath49-anonymous predictor is one that can be used by agents who not only do nt know what time it is , they also do nt know how fast time passes . similarly , @xmath50- and @xmath51-anonymous predictors are predictors that can be used by agents who are insensitive to more extreme distortions of time .",
    "hardin and taylor ask in @xcite how successful a @xmath51-anonymous predictor can be ( see question 7.8.3 on p.  82 ) .",
    "note that @xmath52 , and therefore the requirement of @xmath53-anonymity becomes stronger as @xmath54 increases . we will show that there is a @xmath49-anonymous predictor that always performs well ( see theorem [ thm : main1 ] ) , but there is a scenario in which all @xmath50-anonymous predictors perform badly ( see theorem [ thm : main2 ] ) .",
    "we need a few definitions and lemmas before we can prove our main result about @xmath49-anonymous predictors .",
    "recall that a scenario @xmath2 is said to be _ periodic _ if there is a number @xmath55 such that for all @xmath5 , @xmath56 ; @xmath32 is called a _ period _ of @xmath2 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath2 is periodic with period @xmath32 if @xmath57 .",
    "we will need to generalize this concept to functions in @xmath49 .",
    "we will say that a scenario @xmath2 is _ affine - invariant _ if there is some @xmath47 such that @xmath58 is not the identity function and @xmath59 .",
    "since our agents can see only the past , it will also be convenient to have names for scenarios that are periodic or affine - invariant up to some point in time .",
    "suppose that @xmath5 is a real number and @xmath2 is a scenario .",
    "if there is some @xmath55 such that @xmath60 , then we say that @xmath2 is _ past - periodic on @xmath61 with period @xmath32_. similarly , if there is some nonidentity function @xmath47 such that @xmath62 , then we say that @xmath2 is _ past - affine - invariant on @xmath61_.    clearly , if a scenario is periodic or affine - invariant , then it is also past - periodic or past - affine - invariant . in the other direction ,",
    "if a scenario is past - periodic or past - affine - invariant , then it can be modified to make it periodic or affine - invariant , as our next two lemmas show .",
