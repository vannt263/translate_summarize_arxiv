    "the spontaneous symmetry breaking is one of the most important ingredients of the modern particle physics .",
    "not only it describes the unification of forces acting on the elementary particles , but also it has rich consequences in the early universe .",
    "one is the occurrence of primordial phase transitions followed by the formation of topological defects @xcite .",
    "especially , if there was the spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry , the two dimensional surface - like defects , called domain walls , would be formed in the early era of the universe ( for a review of domain walls and other topological defects , see @xcite ) .",
    "although discrete symmetries naturally arise in many particle physics models , the existence of stable domain walls is disfavored by cosmological considerations . indeed ,",
    "if domain walls survived until the present time , the energy density of walls would eventually come to dominate the total energy density of the universe , causing the fast expansion of the universe to affect the galaxy formation or primordial nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "moreover , the presence of domain walls would cause the excessive anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background observed today , which rules out the existence of stable domain walls with the symmetry breaking scale @xmath21mev @xcite .",
    "however , it is still possible to consider the existence of _ unstable _ domain walls which decay early enough not to lead cosmological disasters .",
    "one way to introduce the instability of walls is to make discrete symmetry only approximate and tilt the potential so as to lift the degeneracy of vacua .",
    "this might be raised by nonrenormalizable operators suppressed by the cutoff scale ( @xmath3 planck scale )  @xcite .",
    "the idea of an approximate discrete symmetry as a mechanism to remove the domain wall problem has been studied by several authors  @xcite .",
    "also , there is another possibility to create unstable domain walls due to a postinflationary nonthermal phase transition  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the production of gravitational waves from the annihilating process of unstable domain walls .",
    "there are early works studying the bubble collisions in the early universe  @xcite and the possibility of generating gravitational waves  @xcite . in these works ,",
    "gravitational waves are considered to be generated by the collision of spherically expanding bubbles , which are created during first order phase transitions ( i.e. the quantum tunneling from the false vacuum to the true vacuum ) .",
    "instead , in this paper we assume that the transition from one vacuum to another proceeds via a realignment of the classical field rather than a quantum tunneling .",
    "the production of gravitational waves from such a process was originally calculated in  @xcite .",
    "however , in  @xcite the radiated energy is calculated only in the simple configuration such as situations with axial symmetry , and only the total intensity of gravitational waves was estimated . instead",
    ", our purpose is to study the production of gravitational waves in more realistic situations ( i.e. to follow from phase transition and to consider generic configuration of the scalar field ) , and calculate the spectrum of gravitational waves .",
    "the gravitational wave is the powerful tool for studying cosmology and high energy physics ( for reviews , see  @xcite ) .",
    "there are various ongoing and planned experiments on the gravitational waves . as for the ground - based experiment ,",
    "ligo  @xcite is running , and lcgt  @xcite is planned . and space - borne interferometers such as lisa  @xcite , bbo @xcite , and decigo  @xcite are planned to be launched in the future .",
    "furthermore , it has been started to plan the ground - based interferometer with improved sensitivity , `` einstein telescope(et ) ''  @xcite in europe recently . in this paper",
    "we discuss whether the stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds produced by domain walls are detectable in these experiments .",
    "if it is detectable and the predicted form of the spectrum is distinctive , we expect that the gravitational wave spectrum from domain walls can be another probe for high energy physics .",
    "one example is in the theory with supersymmetry .",
    "one may be able to measure the parameter of the theory such as the mass of the gravitino , fermionic partner of the graviton , by gravitational waves from annihilation of @xmath4 domain walls @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of domain walls is not easy to investigate because of the nonlinear nature of the evolution equations .",
    "thus it is necessary to use numerical calculations to follow the evolution of domain walls with arbitrary structures .",
    "the first complete numerical study was performed by press , ryden , and spergel  @xcite by using the modified field equation for the scalar field ( called the prs algorithm ) .",
    "also , kawano  @xcite simulated the evolution of domain walls by using the thin wall effective equation of motion ( similar to the nambu - goto equation  @xcite for cosmic strings ) .",
    "later , several authors investigated further by up - dated high resolution simulations  @xcite and the numerical simulations for unstable domain walls are performed in  @xcite . however , although these numerical simulations successfully demonstrate the macroscopic evolution of domain wall networks , they put an unphysical assumption about the width of a domain wall , and we can not use their computational method since this method may invalidates the estimation of the energy of gravitational waves ( see section  [ sec4a ] ) .",
    "therefore , we solve the field equations directly rather than rely on the previous methodologies .",
    "this gives us severe technical restrictions in choosing parameters of the simulations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    ", we shortly review the dynamics of domain wall networks . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    ", we describe the formalism to calculate classical gravitational wave spectra radiated by the scalar field in the systematic way .",
    "then , after a short discussion about the difficulty in numerical simulations , we present the results of our numerical simulations in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "we combine the results of numerical calculations with analytic estimations , and discuss the observability of the spectrum by extrapolating them in section  [ sec5 ] .",
    "finally we conclude in section  [ sec6 ] .",
    "we consider the model of the real scalar field with the potential @xmath5 the first term is the usual double well potential . in the absence of the second term",
    ", this model has a discrete @xmath6 symmetry corresponding to the transformation @xmath7 .",
    "the second term is introduced in order to lift the degeneracy of the two vacua and make the discrete symmetry approximate . in this model , the scalar field",
    "is assumed to be thermal equilibrium at the first stage of their evolution , and we introduce the finite temperature correction in the last term of the potential . when finite temperature effects become negligible , the potential has two minima @xmath8 and the formation of domain walls occurs .",
    "the difference of the energy density between two minima is @xmath9 and the height of the potential barrier is @xmath10 .",
    "the dimensionless constant parameter @xmath11 is called `` bias '' , which makes domain walls unstable .    in the numerical simulations which we will describe later",
    ", we solve the classical filed equation with the potential given by eq .",
    "( [ eq2 - 1 ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that we consider only a quiescent second order transition .",
    "if there are more violent first order transitions via a quantum tunneling , the gravitational wave signature might be enhanced significantly .",
    "such a quantum treatment is , however , beyond the scope of this paper . in the following two subsections ,",
    "we briefly review the property of the evolution of domain wall networks .",
    "the well known property of the evolution of domain wall networks is that there exists the phase of `` scaling '' , in which the typical length scales such as the wall curvature radius @xmath12 and the distance of two neighboring walls @xmath13 are given by hubble radius , @xmath14 this property is originally studied in  @xcite numerically , and by other groups in  @xcite .",
    "however , the analytic modeling of the scaling solution is found in  @xcite .",
    "when domain wall networks are in scaling regime , the energy density of domain walls is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the tension of the wall .",
    "( [ eq2 - 3 ] ) is also expressed as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the comoving area density of the wall , and @xmath19 is the conformal time : @xmath20 .",
    "if we assume radiation dominated universe , @xmath18 is proportional to @xmath21 , which is a criterion to distinguish whether walls are in scaling regime .",
    "there are two effects caused by the bias in the potential .",
    "one is the bias of two vacua chosen during the phase transition , and another is the volume pressure which shrinks the false vacuum domains and eliminates domain walls .",
    "the cosmological scenario with biased discrete symmetry is investigated in  @xcite and here we follow the analysis of it .",
    "let us denote the probability of having a scalar field fluctuation during the phase transition end up in plus vacuum as @xmath22 and in minus vacuum as @xmath23 .",
    "if there exists the bias , the ratio of these two probabilities is given by @xmath24 here , @xmath25 is the difference of the free energy between two vacua , and @xmath26 is the correlation length of the scalar fields .",
    "if we estimate @xmath27 as ginzburg temperature  @xcite , given by @xmath28 , the above equation can be written as @xmath29 therefore , there exists the bias between two vacua if @xmath30 . the spatial distribution of two vacua after phase transition has been studied by using percolation theory @xcite . it has been shown that if the probability @xmath22 ( or @xmath23 ) is bigger than a critical value @xmath31 , an infinite plus ( minus ) cluster appears in the space . if we approximate the space as a three dimensional cubic lattice , @xmath32 @xcite , and by requiring both @xmath22 and @xmath23 are bigger than @xmath31 , we obtain @xmath33 if the condition given by eq .",
    "( [ eq2 - 7 ] ) is satisfied , the infinite size of domain walls would appear after phase transition .",
    "after the formation of domain walls , there are two forces acting on the walls .",
    "the first force is a surface tension , which is given by @xmath34 ( as a pressure ) .",
    "it smooths out the small scale structure on the wall and straightens the wall up to the horizon scale .",
    "the second force is a volume pressure , which is given by @xmath35 .",
    "it accelerates the wall against the false vacuum regions due to the energy difference between the two vacua and collapses the wall .",
    "the evolution of domain wall networks depends on when and which of the two forces dominate .",
    "the volume pressure dominates when @xmath36 is satisfied , and the corresponding wall curvature radius is @xmath37 if we require that the wall has been straighten up to the horizon scale before the volume pressure becomes effective , we obtain the condition @xmath38 where @xmath12 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq2 - 8 ] ) and @xmath39 is the hubble parameter at the phase transition ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "this condition gives an upper bound for @xmath11 : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom at @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the planck mass . on the other hand ,",
    "a requirement that domain walls do not dominate the energy density of the universe gives a lower bound for @xmath11 . when domain wall networks are in scaling regime , the energy density of domain walls is estimated as @xmath45 .",
    "if we assume the radiation dominated universe , the total energy density of the universe is given by @xmath46 .",
    "the domain walls start to dominate the universe ( @xmath47 ) when @xmath48 , where @xmath49 meanwhile , the typical time scale of the collapse of the wall network is given by the condition @xmath50 where @xmath12 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq2 - 8 ] ) : @xmath51 therefore , the condition that domain walls collapse before wall domination is @xmath52 , from which we obtain @xmath53 to sum up , the domains with infinite size appear if the condition given by eq .",

    "( [ eq2 - 11 ] ) .",
    "in this section , we describe how to calculate the spectrum of the stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds produced by domain walls .",
    "we use the formalism of `` green s function method '' developed by dufaux et al .",
    "originally this formalism was applied to the production of gravitational waves from preheating @xcite after inflation . however ,",
    "this framework is applicable to general scalar fields in expanding universe , especially the higgs field forming domain walls considered here . in the following ,",

    "the computational strategy is as follows : first , we obtain the time evolution of scalar fields in the real space @xmath98 by the lattice simulation , then we compute the tt projected stress - energy tensor as eqs .",

    "the evolution equation of domain walls is highly nonlinear and we are forced to use numerical analysis . however , there is a technical problem in computing the evolution of domain walls numerically : one must consider two extremely different length scales simultaneously .",
    "one is the width of the wall @xmath99 , which must be bigger than a lattice spacing throughout the numerical simulation in order to resolve domain walls by individual unit of lattice .",
    "but if we perform simulations in the comoving box , the physical lattice spacing expands as @xmath100 , and becomes unable to resolve the wall in the finite simulation time scale .",
    "the other length scale is the hubble horizon , which must be smaller than the simulation box in order to avoid unphysical effect caused by the finite size of the simulation box .",
    "unfortunately , there is a large gap between these two length scales by a factor of the ratio between the mass scale of the scalar field and the planck scale as @xmath101 therefore , we can not simulate the physical evolution of domain walls for a long time for energy scale @xmath102 sufficiently smaller than the planck scale .",
