    "the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite experiments at the lhc have provided conclusive evidence for a scalar boson with higgs - like propeties and a mass of approximately 125 gev .",
    "while this discovery provides the first glimpse of physics at the tev energy scale , many important questions ( such as the origin of the higgs vacuum expectation value and of the multitude of fermion masses and mixings ) remain unanswered .",
    "theories that address these questions require dynamics beyond that in the standard model .    one attractive possible feature of theories beyond the standard model is an extension to the color sector of the standard model .",
    "the simplest possiblity for this extension is to enlarge the qcd gauge group to @xmath0 , with ordinary color identified with the diagonal subgroup of this larger symmetry .",

    "these new colored states can have a large effect on the properties of the standard model higgs boson @xcite .",
    "the renormalizable coloron model @xcite is the minimal extension of the standard model incorporating an enlarged color gauge group that provides a framework for examining the interplay between the breaking of the electroweak and extended color gauge symmetries . in this paper",
    "we discuss the constraints on this model derived from the requirements of vacuum stability , tree - level unitarity , electroweak precision measurements , and from lhc measurements of the properties of the observed higgs - like scalar boson .",
    "our analysis demonstrates the interplay between these various constraints .",
    "tree - level unitarity arguments constrain the masses of the scalar particles associated with breaking the extended color sector in relation to that sector s symmetry breaking scale .",
    "the bounds derived from precision electroweak measurements strongly limit the amount by which the observed 125 gev scalar mass eigenstate can mix with a gauge - singlet state from the color symmetry breaking sector .",
    "the observed production and decay properties of the 125 gev scalar also constrain this mixing in a complementary regime , though in a manner that depends on the details of the model . these constraints on mixing , in turn , have consequences for the spectrum of scalar states . a summary of the range of parameters allowed in the renormalizable coloron model",

    "[ combo ] as a whole , we conclude that there are several interesting relationships between the constraints on the five model parameters @xmath242 :    * constraints from precision electroweak tests generally restrict @xmath241 to be less than @xmath243 , with this restriction becoming ( logarithmically ) stronger as @xmath127 increases .",
    "* stability of the potential implies that @xmath244 and @xmath245 . * maintaining the unitarity of scalar boson scattering cross - sections at high energies bounds the scalar masses of the theory for a given value of @xmath66 , with @xmath246 .",
    "larger values of @xmath241 ( potentiallly as large as 0.5 ) are also allowed , though only for relatively small values of @xmath127 and for particular , model - dependent choices for the spectator fermion content of the theory ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lhc95clexcma0ma100 ] ) . finally , in the region @xmath247 the light scalar becomes indistinguishable from the standard model higgs boson .",
    "therefore , to the extent that all experimental data remain consistent with the standard model , the upper bound on @xmath241 will become stronger over time .",
    "we have also considered direct lhc constraints on the @xmath56 particle , arising from searches for a heavy higgs boson @xcite . the diboson signal rate that the @xmath56 would yield depends sensitively on the scalar spectrum of the theory and ( especially ) on the number of spectator quark generations . for @xmath218 or 3 , we have shown that @xmath127 is likely to be sufficiently constrained to close a substantial portion of the parameter space shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : lhc95clexcma0ma100 ] .",
    "however , for @xmath220 a cancellation between the coloron and fermionic contributions to the gluon fusion @xmath56-boson production cross section renders the current limits too weak to be definitive .",
    "our analysis has also shown that the properties of the scalar sector do not constrain the masses of the colorons or the spectator fermions .",
    "the strongest limits on these masses remain those mentioned at the start of the paper : tevatron and lhc data require the coloron mass , @xmath77 , to be at least in the tev region @xcite , while the tevatron excludes the mass range from 50 to 125 gev for the scalar color - octet , @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "it is fascinating to see that models with extended strong interaction sectors remain viable in light of the extensive new data from the lhc .",
