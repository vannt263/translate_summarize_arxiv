    "physical and geometric motivations of make sense mainly for @xmath80 , but the problem is intriguing in the effort to shed light on the structural properties of singular diffusion equations .",
    "questions concerning both existence and non - existence of solutions to the cauchy problem of and its related elliptic equation are investigated in @xcite ( just mention few ) .",

    "equation can be viewed as a formal limit of the porous medium equation @xmath81 a proof of hlder continuity for non - negative , locally bounded , local solutions to the porous medium equation can be found in appendix  b of @xcite .",
    "however , the local behavior of local solutions to presents many striking differences from that of local solutions to the porous medium equation . see @xcite for more detailed discussion .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that if one assumes that @xmath82 then @xmath8 is locally bounded .",
    "if in addition one assumes that @xmath83 then a harnack - type inequality is established and thus , if the solution does not vanish identically on a hyperplane normal to the time axis , then the equation is neither degenerate nor singular in a backward cylinder with its vertex on the hyperplane . as a result @xmath8 is a classical solution in such a cylinder .",
    "in fact , it is shown in @xcite that under such circumstances the solution is analytic in space variables while infinitely differentiable in time .",
    "nevertheless , these results do not explain why some explicit solutions , for example , could be continuous up to their extinction time .",
    "theorem [ thm:1 ] gives a first sufficient condition that insures continuity at a vanishing point of @xmath8 , and an explicit estimate of the modulus of continuity is given .",
    "moreover , we establish in theorem [ thm:2 ] an estimate on the hausdorff measure of the set of discontinuity of @xmath8 .",
    "those effort being made , it is interesting to ask whether the higher integrability conditon of @xmath78 for @xmath84 can be obtained from the notion of solution and whether the condition is necessary for a point to be a continuity point of @xmath8 .",
    "last but not least , can we construct an explicit bounded solution with discontinuity ? in @xcite when @xmath33 , a solution discontinuous on a line segment was constructed",
