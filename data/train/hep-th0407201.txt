    "the investigation of quantum corrections in supersymmetric theories is a very interesting and sometimes nontrivial problem .",
    "for example , we remind of the so called `` anomaly puzzle '' .",
    "the matter is that in supersymmetric theories the axial anomaly and the anomaly of the energy - momentum tensor trace are components of a single chiral supermultiplet @xcite . according to adler - bardeen theorem @xcite the axial anomaly",
    "is exhausted at the one - loop , while the trace anomaly should be proportional to the @xmath1-function @xcite to all orders of the perturbation theory .",
    "therefore the @xmath1-function in supersymmetric theories can be supposed to be completely defined by the one - loop approximation @xcite .",
    "however explicit perturbative calculations in @xmath0 supersymmetric theories regularized by the dimensional reduction @xcite revealed , that there were higher loops contributions to the @xmath1-function @xcite .",
    "thus we obtain a contradiction , which was called in the literature `` the anomaly puzzle '' .",
    "different at the first sight solutions of the anomaly puzzle were proposed in @xcite and @xcite . nevertheless the results of both papers were not confirmed by explicit calculations so far the dimensional reduction was used for the regularization .",
    "the reason , found in @xcite , is the mathematical inconsistency of the dimensional reduction , which was first pointed in @xcite .",
    "( note , that unlike the dimensional reduction , the dimensional regularization @xcite is not mathematically inconsistent .",
    "however it breaks the supersymmetry and is , therefore , very inconvenient for using in supersymmetric theories . )",
    "the calculations , made with the mathematically consistent higher derivative regularization @xcite in the two- @xcite and three - loop @xcite approximations for the @xmath0 supersymmetric electrodynamics , showed , that in this case there was no anomaly puzzle . according to this papers in supersymmetric theories the @xmath1-function , defined as a derivative of the renormalized coupling constant with respect to @xmath3 , and gell - mann - low function are different due to the rescaling anomaly .",
    "the former is proportional to the trace anomaly , while the latter has corrections in all orders of the perturbation theory and in the considered approximation coincides with the exact novikov , shifman , vainshtein and zakharov ( nsvz ) @xmath1-function . for the @xmath0 supersymmetric electrodynamics",
    "the exact nsvz @xmath1-function is :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the anomalous dimension of the matter superfield .",
    "( first time the exact @xmath1-function was constructed in @xcite as a result of the investigation of instanton contributions structure . )    note , that the using of the higher derivative regularization allows to relate various formal solutions of the anomaly puzzle , which were proposed in the literature .",
    "nevertheless , the investigation of the supersymmetric electrodynamics up to now was restricted by the frames of the three - loop approximation .",
    "however , it would be interesting to elucidate if it is possible to perform the explicit calculations exactly to all orders of the perturbation theory . in this paper",
    "we investigate a question , if it is possible to obtain the result , which is exact to all orders , using schwinger - dyson equations and ward identities .",

    "[ section_anomaly_puzzle ] ) .",
    "then divergences in the two - point green function are present only in the one - loop approximation , but gell - mann - low function coincides with the exact nsvz @xmath1-function . in the conclusion we discuss the obtained results .",

    "in this paper some contributions to the two - point green function of the gauge field at @xmath6 were calculated using schwinger - dyson equations and ward identities for the @xmath0 supersymmetric electrodynamics .",
    "unfortunately we did not manage to find this function completely from ward identities , but the most involved diagrams had been calculated completely .    nevertheless , using the results of explicit three - loop calculations it is possible to suggest structure of terms , which can not be found from the ward identity . then the @xmath1-function and gell - mann - low function can be found exactly to all orders of the perturbation theory .",
    "the obtained results allow to give a simple and clear solution of the anomaly puzzle in the @xmath0 supersymmetric electrodynamics , which , in particular , relates different solutions of the anomaly puzzle known in the literature @xcite .",
    "let us remind its main points :    because the axial anomaly and the anomaly of the energy - momentum tensor trace are components of a single supermultiplet , @xmath1-function ( [ beta_definition ] ) should be exhausted at the one - loop according to adler - bardeen theorem and is given by eq .",

    "this is the result , that is found with the higher derivative regularization both for the massless and for the massive theory .",
    "therefore , the obtained results completely agree with the structure of the anomalies supermultiplet .    nevertheless , gell - mann - low function , which is defined by the transversal part of the two - point green function of the gauge field , has corrections in all orders and coincides with the exact nsvz @xmath1-function .",

    "( this jacobian was explicitly written in @xcite . ) therefore , even after the substitution @xmath185 generating functional ( [ modified_z ] ) will contain @xmath213 and , therefore , will depend on @xmath207 . as a consequence eq .",
    "( [ gl_and_beta ] ) , which relates @xmath1-functions defined by the different ways now is not valid , and the functions @xmath1 and @xmath202 are not equivalent in the considered case .    in principle",

    "two different ways to do it were proposed in @xcite . then @xmath1-function ( [ beta_definition ] ) has corrections in all orders of the perturbation theory , but the arguments , based on the structure of the anomalies supermultiplet fail due to some reasons .",
    "that is why the anomaly puzzle does not take place if the theory is regularized by higher derivatives .",
    "finally we mention , that it would be interesting to perform the similar investigation for the supersymmetric yang - mills theory .",
    "however for this theory the calculations with the higher covariant derivative regularization are very involved , because the presence of the term with higher _ covariant _ derivatives @xcite essentially complicates the form of the action . in this case",
    "the calculations can be considerably simplified if the covariant derivatives are substituted by the ordinary derivatives . then the gauge invariance will be certainly broken , so that ward identities can be also broken by some local noninvariant terms .",
    "nevertheless the gauge invariance can be restored by the special choice of the subtraction scheme , so that it is possible to use noninvariant regularizations @xcite for the calculations .",
    "such scheme was proposed in @xcite for abelian supersymmetric theories and in @xcite for the nonabelian theories .",
    "so , it is possible , that application of the above described regularization to supersymmetric yang - mills theories enables us to perform similar calculations also in the nonabelian case . at present",
