    "we therefore obtain the equality @xmath26 so that the system is ergodic in the boltzmann - khinchin sense , that is , time and ensemble averages coincide . in particular , we see that the time averaged msd @xmath27 is independent of the observation time @xmath19 , reflecting the stationarity of the process .",
    "now consider the underdamped langevin equation with inertial term @xcite , @xmath28 the constant damping coefficient @xmath29 and the diffusion coefficient @xmath9 are connected via the einstein - smoluchowski - sutherland fluctuation dissipation relation @xmath30 where we use the convention to set the boltzmann constant @xmath31 to unity .",
    "the two point velocity correlation function encoded by the underdamped langevin equation ( [ usbm0 ] ) decays exponentially in the time difference , @xmath32 the associated characteristic time is defined by the inverse of the friction coefficient , @xmath33 .",

    "sbm should not be confused with fractional langevin equation motion or fractional brownian motion which are non - markovian yet gaussian processes with stationary increments whose probability density in the overdamped limit coincides with that of sbm but has a completely different physical origin @xcite . the underdamped langevin equation for fractional langevin equation motion was analysed in refs .",
    "@xcite and shown to exhibit interesting effects such as oscillatory behaviour of the velocity correlations as well as transient ageing and non - ergodic behaviour . however , these decay rather quickly to make way for the expected overdamped behaviour . here",
    "we show that the behaviour of udsbm is significantly different from the fractional langevin equation motion and involved persistent inertial terms .    before starting the discussion of sbm",
    "we note that anomalous diffusion with time dependent diffusion coefficient @xmath40 occurs , for instance , in the famed batchelor model for turbulent diffusion @xcite .",
    "sbm was used to model the water diffusion in brain measured by magnetic resonance imaging @xcite , the mobility of proteins in cell membranes @xcite , or the motion of molecules in porous environments @xcite . as effective subdiffusion model",

    "physically time dependent diffusion coefficients arise naturally in systems with a time dependent temperature such as melting snow @xcite or free cooling granular gases , in which the temperature is given by the kinetic energy , which dissipates progressively into internal degrees of freedom of the gas particles @xcite .",

    "@xmath55 we get that @xmath56 thus the msd and the time averaged msd exhibit a fundamentally different ( lag ) time dependence , a weak breaking of ergodicity .",
    "in contrast to the langevin equation with constant coefficients the time averaged msd now also depends on the measurement time @xmath19 , a phenomenon called ageing @xcite .",

    "let us now turn to the udsbm case and consider the underdamped version of the langevin equation ( [ lang_sbm ] ) with time dependent diffusion and damping coefficients , @xmath47 and @xmath64 , respectively , @xmath65 in that sense it is a straightforward extension of the brownian langevin equation ( [ usbm0 ] ) with additional multiplicative coefficients .",

    "thus @xmath74 defines the characteristic decay time of the velocity correlation function , which is now also time dependent .",
    "the choice of the damping coefficient in the form ( [ damp ] ) appears natural since it is in accordance with the two paradigmatic models .",
    "the first one corresponds to a massive brownian particle in a gas with continuous heating or cooling , consisting of elastically colliding particles : in this case the damping coefficient may be derived as a stokes friction coefficient and is proportional to the dynamical viscosity which in turn scales as @xmath75 @xcite .",

    "( [ diffcoef ] ) @xcite and the motion of granular particles slows down continuously while the inter - collision times become longer on average . the underdamped langevin equation ( [ lang ] )",
    "is thus valid for both the description of an underdamped brownian particle in a bath with time dependent temperature and for the self - diffusion in free cooling granular gases , as will be elaborated further below .",
    "the langevin approach is justified if the typical temperature variation time scale @xmath45 is sufficiently larger than the inverse initial damping coefficient , @xmath81 .",
    "this time scale separation allows us to introduce the local fluctuation dissipation theorem ( [ lfdt ] ) .",

    ". however , as we will show there exists a long lasting intermediate regime in which the motion of the particles may not be described in terms of the overdamped approximation since both terms have comparable contributions as long as @xmath2 is sufficiently small .",

    "<S> it is quite generally assumed that the overdamped langevin equation provides a quantitative description of the dynamics of a classical brownian particle in the long time limit . </S>",
    "<S> we establish and investigate a paradigm anomalous diffusion process governed by an underdamped langevin equation with an explicit time dependence of the system temperature and thus the diffusion and damping coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> we show that for this underdamped scaled brownian motion ( udsbm ) the overdamped limit fails to describe the long time behaviour of the system and may practically even not exist at all for a certain range of the parameter values . </S>",
    "<S> thus persistent inertial effects play a non - negligible role even at significantly long times . from this study a general questions on the applicability of the overdamped limit to describe the long time motion of an anomalously diffusing particle arises , with profound consequences for the relevance of overdamped anomalous diffusion models . </S>",
    "<S> we elucidate our results in view of analytical and simulations results for the anomalous diffusion of particles in free cooling granular gases .        </S>",
    "<S> the mean squared displacement ( msd ) of a brownian particle at sufficiently long times follows the linear time dependence @xmath0 , as predicted by the second fick s law @xcite and physically explained by einstein @xcite and smoluchowski @xcite . however , already in 1926 richardson reported the distinct non - fickian behaviour of tracer particles in atmospheric turbulence @xcite . today , such _ anomalous diffusion _ </S>",
    "<S> is typically associated with the power - law form @xmath1 of the msd , where subdiffusion corresponds to values of the anomalous diffusion exponent @xmath2 in the range @xmath3 and superdiffusion to @xmath4 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> classical examples for subdiffusion include the charge carrier motion in amorphous semiconductors @xcite , the spreading of tracer chemicals in subsurface aquifers @xcite or in convection rolls @xcite , as well as the motion of a tracer particle in a single file of interacting particles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> superdiffusion is known from tracer motion in turbulent flows @xcite and weakly chaotic systems @xcite , or for randomly searching , actively moving creatures such as microorganisms and bacteria @xcite , albatrosses @xcite , or humans @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> modern microscopic techniques , in particular , superresolution microscopy , have led to the discovery of a multitude of anomalous diffusion processes in living biological cells and complex fluids @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus subdiffusion was observed in live cells for rna molecules @xcite , chromosomal telomeres @xcite , or submicron lipid @xcite and insulin granules @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even small proteins such as gfp were demonstrated to subdiffuse @xcite . in artificially crowded systems , subdiffusion is also routinely observed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> superdiffusion of injected as well as endogenous submicron particles , due to active processes such as molecular motor driven transport was reported in the cellular context @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> following the progress of supercomputing capabilities , subdiffusion was also reported for complex molecular systems such as relative diffusion in single proteins @xcite , in pure @xcite and crowded @xcite lipid bilayer membranes @xcite .    apart from the power - law anomalous </S>",
    "<S> diffusion ( [ x2-ad ] ) ultraslow processes with a logarithmic time dependence @xmath5 of the msd exist in a variety of systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such logarithmic time dependencies occur in sinai diffusion in quenched random energy landscapes @xcite , periodically iterated maps @xcite , colloidal hard sphere systems at the liquid - glass transition @xcite , random walks on bundled structures @xcite , or in single file diffusion with power - law trapping time distributions for individual particles @xcite . a particular system in which ultraslow diffusion occurs are granular gases in the homogeneous cooling stage , in which each particle - particle collision reduces the kinetic energy of the two particles by a constant factor , the so called restitution coefficient @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the nature of anomalous diffusion of the forms ( [ x2-ad ] ) or ( [ x2log ] ) is non - universal and may originate from numerous physical processes . power - law anomalous diffusion , for instance , emerges for continuous time random walk processes with scale - free distributions of waiting times or jump lengths @xcite , generalised langevin equations of fractional brownian motion with power - law correlated , gaussian noise input @xcite , or diffusion processes with deterministic @xcite or random @xcite position dependence of the diffusivity . </S>",
    "<S> ultraslow diffusion can be described in terms of continuous time random walks with super heavy - tailed waiting times @xcite or heterogeneous diffusion processes with exponential space dependence of the diffusivity @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the motion of a particle of mass @xmath6 in a thermal bath is typically described by a langevin equation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while the short time motion of this particle is ballistic , once collision events become relevant , a crossover to normal brownian motion with msd ( [ x2-ad ] ) and @xmath7 occurs . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding crossover time scale is given by the inverse friction coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> for brownian motion at sufficiently long times it is sufficient to use the overdamped langevin equation without the inertia term , to quantitatively describe the particle motion . in other words , the long time limit of the full langevin equation including the newton term @xmath8 coincides with the solution of the overdamped langevin equation @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> here we study a simple anomalous diffusion process based on the full langevin equation with inertial term and a time dependent diffusion coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> for this underdamped scaled brownian motion ( udsbm ) we demonstrate that the long time limit may be distinctly disparate from the analogous overdamped process due to extremely persistent inertial effects , that dominate the particle motion on intermediate - asymptotic time scales . </S>",
    "<S> this a priori surprising finding breaks with a commonly accepted dogma for stochastic processes and demonstrates that the correct mathematical description for particles with a mass in the long time limit for anomalous diffusion processes may be a delicate issue , that requires special care . </S>",
    "<S> our findings are based on analytical calculations and confirmed by extensive stochastic simulations . </S>",
    "<S> comparison to event driven simulations of granular gases confirm the results of our udsbm model for a physical model based on first principles .    </S>",
    "<S> to proceed , we first provide a concise summary of the properties of the regular underdamped langevin equation for brownian motion and its overdamped limit . </S>",
    "<S> the following section then briefly introduces the overdamped langevin description for scaled brownian motion ( sbm ) corresponding to the udsbm process without the inertia term . </S>",
    "<S> the subsequent section then introduces the full langevin equation for udsbm including the mass term . </S>",
    "<S> we unravel the ensemble and time averaged characteristics of this udsbm process analytically and show the agreement with stochastic simulations . </S>",
    "<S> both cases of power - law anomalous diffusion ( [ x2-ad ] ) as well as ultraslow diffusion ( [ x2log ] ) are considered . in particular , we also present a comparison of the udsbm process with event driven simulations of a cooling granular gas . </S>",
    "<S> mathematical details of the derivations are presented in the methods section . </S>"
