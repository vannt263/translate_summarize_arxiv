    "light elements , like h , c , and n are considered to be playing a significant role in the phase stability and mechanical strength of fe .",
    "compared to the host fe atom , radii of light atoms are smaller so they do not substitute them and prefer to sit at the the interstitials sites.@xcite however , recent reports show that at the surfaces of both @xmath4-fe and @xmath5-fe , c at the substitutional sites significantly reduces the surface energy  @xcite so it prefers substitutional over the interstitials .",
    "iron carbides are of crucial importance in the design of the mechanical properties of steels and other iron alloys.@xcite carbon interstitials are also present in various iron carbide phases ( fe@xmath8c , fe@xmath9c , fe@xmath10c@xmath9 , fe@xmath2c ) as precipitates in a ferrite matrix or in pearlite - type or banite - type microstructures  @xcite . experimental investigations  @xcite of martensites have indicated that the octahedral interstitial sites are preferred locations for carbon atoms in the bcc iron structure .",
    "the tetragonal distortion of the martensitic lattice is generally regarded as direct evidence of an unequal distribution of carbon atoms over the three available octahedral interstitial sublattices .",
    "when the carbon atoms occupy a single sub - lattice within an otherwise bcc iron lattice , the microscopic lattice symmetry is reduced to tetragonal , and a tetragonal distortion of the bcc iron lattice results .",
    "zener  @xcite treated the thermodynamics of such carbon ordering , and the tetragonal martensite is accordingly referred to as `` zener - ordered . ''",
    "it was shown  @xcite that a secondary ordering of carbon interstitials may occur within the zener sublattice during martensite aging , prior to the detection of @xmath11- or @xmath12-carbide .",
    "these results have been interpreted in terms of the formation of the fe@xmath1c phase with a considerable deviation from stoichiometric composition.@xcite    in the past much attention has been focused to interstitial c in bcc fe , _",

    "this indicate , that it will not be easy for c to form such c - fe@xmath1c structure in low carbon steels .      in order to obtain the elastic properties , we followed our previous approach  @xcite and @xmath330.03 amount of strains was imposed , using the shear and elastic volume conserved deformation matrices .",

    "this is also very encouraging that c free fcc fe is not stable , however it becomes stable when c is placed at the octahedral interstitial site .",

    "this abrupt change in magnetic moment indicates that c - fe@xmath1c is very sensitive to lattice deformation which can be lead to the phase stability of the system",
    ". this abrupt change may be due to spin - flip effect.@xcite    in de - localized electron systems , magnetism originates from the difference in the spin up and spin down bands populations . also deformation affects de - localized systems drastically due to strong interaction of magnetic moments and it would be very necessary to study the effects of deformation . as shown above that c - fe@xmath1c",

    "the magnetism of c - fe@xmath1c is very sensitive around @xmath53 , and at large elongation the magnetic moments of c - fe@xmath1c are saturated , whereas at large compressions the magnetic moment decreases . also , the maximum in the magnetic moment shifts to smaller value of c / a at smaller volume of c - fe@xmath1c .",
    "such magnetic behaviour clearly indicates that c - fe@xmath1c is dynamically unstable due to magnetism .",
