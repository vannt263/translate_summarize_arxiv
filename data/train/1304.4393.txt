    "this mixing connects the convective envelope with the external wing of the hydrogen burning shell and induces surface abundance modifications in red giant stars ( charbonnel & lagarde 2010 ) .",
    "unfortunately , this model is computed so far only for solar metallicity stars .",
    "an other so called cool bottom processing model has been developed more than a decade ago ( boothroyd et al .",

    "helium - core - burning stars have @xmath0 ratios already lowered by extra mixing and lie in the lower part of the @xmath0 versus stellar mass diagram .",
    "it is seen that the trend of lowering of carbon isotope ratios in low - mass he - core - burning stars is quite steep .",
    "carbon isotope ratios may be quite different in stars of quite similar masses , for example , in stars of about @xmath45 , the @xmath0 values range from about 18 to 9 .",
    "the theoretical model of thermohaline mixing is better reflecting the observational data in this respect than the more shallow model of cool bottom processing .",
    "as concerns the helium - core - burning stars of higher masses , it seems that the mixing was more intense , and this might be caused by a stellar rotation while stars were in a stage of hydrogen burning in their cores .",
    "charbonnel & lagarde ( 2010 ) computed models with rotation - induced mixing for stars at the zero age main sequence ( zams ) having rotational velocities of 110 , 250 and 300kms@xmath3 .",
    "typical initial zams rotation velocities were chosen depending on the stellar mass based on observed rotation distributions in young open clusters ( gaige 1993 ) .",
    "the convective envelope was supposed to rotate as a solid body through the evolution .",
    "the transport coefficients for chemicals associated to thermohaline and rotation - induced mixing were simply added in the diffusion equation and the possible interactions between the two mechanisms were not considered .",
    "interesting to note that the rotation - induced mixing modifies the internal chemical structure of main sequence stars , although its signatures are revealed only later in the stellar evolution .    in fig .",
    "7 we plotted a model corresponding to the rotational velocity of 250kms@xmath3 .",
    "the observational data for stars of about @xmath2 in our sample require a modelling of mixing with rotation of about this speed when stars were on the main sequence .",
    "even large rotationally induced mixing is suggested by stars of high masses in open clusters ( e.g. tautvaiien et al .",

    "the stellar positions in the @xmath0 versus stellar mass diagram as well as comparisons to stellar evolutionary sequences in the luminosity versus effective temperature diagram may show which stars are helium - core - burning ones and which are first ascent giants . from the available sample of 62 galactic red clump stars investigated in this work and paper  i ,",
    "35 were identified as helium - core - burning ones and 27 as first ascent just hydrogen - shell - burning giants . in the paper by mishenina",
    "et al .  ( 2006 ) , according to nitrogen abundance values , the authors have suggested 21 helium - core - burning stars , about 54 candidates to helium - core - burning stars and about 100 first ascent giants .",
    "looking to the density of stars above and below the clump in the colour - magnitude diagram for the _ hipparcos _ catalogue , it seems that a number of helium - core - burning stars in the galactic red clump should be slightly larger than a number of first ascent giants .",
    "for example , if we count a number of stars in a frame of @xmath46 and @xmath47 targeted on the clump , we count 1050 stars , while below the clump , in a frame of @xmath48 and @xmath47 , we have 380 stars .    a very promising way to distinguish between hydrogen- and helium - burning red giant stars was recently uncovered by asteroseismic observations ( bedding et al .  2011 ) . from high - precision photometry obtained by the kepler space observatory",
    ", it was found that gravity - mode period spacings are different in hydrogen- and helium - burning red giants . in hydrogen - shell - burning stars",
    "the period spacing is mostly about 50 seconds , and in helium - burning stars it is from about 100 to 300 seconds .",
    "these differences appear because of differences of internal structure and core densities of stars .",
    "this asteroseismic way of stellar evolutionary status determination is especially important for stars of larger than @xmath2 masses for which chemical composition signatures of extra - mixing are less trustful .      in this work we present the main atmospheric parameters , abundances of nitrogen , carbon and oxygen , and @xmath0 ratios for a sample of 28 galactic clump stars from high - resolution spectra observed on the nordic optical telescope ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the mean abundances of c , n and o in the investigated clump stars support our previous estimations ( paper  i ) that compared to dwarf stars of the galactic disk carbon is depleted by about 0.2  dex , nitrogen is enhanced by 0.2  dex and oxygen is close to abundances in dwarfs .",
    "the @xmath0 and c / n ratios for the galactic red clump stars analysed were compared to the evolutionary models of extra - mixing .",
    "the steeper drop of @xmath0 ratio in the model of thermohaline mixing ( charbonnel & lagarde 2010 ) better reflects the observational data at low stellar masses than the more shallow model of cool bottom processing ( boothroyd & sackman 1999 ) .    in our sample , for stars of about @xmath2 masses the modelling of rotationally induced mixing should be considered with rotation of about 250kms@xmath3 at the time when a star was at the hydrogen - core - burning stage .",

    "<S> in this work we present the main atmospheric parameters , carbon , nitrogen and oxygen abundances , and @xmath0 ratios determined in a sample of 28 galactic clump stars . </S>",
    "<S> abundances of carbon were studied using the @xmath1 band at 5086.2   . </S>",
    "<S> the wavelength interval 79808130   with strong cn features was analysed in order to determine nitrogen abundances and @xmath0 isotope ratios . </S>",
    "<S> the oxygen abundances were determined from the [ oi ] line at 6300   . </S>",
    "<S> the mean abundances of c , n and o abundances in the investigated clump stars support our previous estimations that , compared to the sun and dwarf stars of the galactic disk , carbon is depleted by about 0.2  dex , nitrogen is enhanced by 0.2  dex and oxygen is close to abundances in dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 and c / n ratios for galactic red clump stars analysed were compared to the evolutionary models of extra - mixing . </S>",
    "<S> the steeper drop of @xmath0 ratio in the model of thermohaline mixing by charbonnel & lagarde better reflects the observational data at low stellar masses than the more shallow model of cool bottom processing by boothroyd & sackman . for stars of about @xmath2 masses a modelling of rotationally induced mixing </S>",
