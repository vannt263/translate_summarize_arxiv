    "there exist many examples of systems showing slow relaxation and ageing : spin glasses@xcite , disordered dielectrics@xcite , supercooled liquids@xcite , etc ... charge density waves ( cdws ) and spin density waves ( sdws)@xcite show `` interrupted ageing''@xcite , meaning that there exists an upper bound @xmath4 to the relaxation times .",
    "the protocol of ageing experiments in cdws and sdws is the following : the system is equilibrated at the temperature @xmath5 ( one waits for a time longer than @xmath4 ) . at time @xmath6 the temperature is changed from @xmath5 to @xmath7 where @xmath8 is very small compared to @xmath5 .",
    "the temperature is kept constant until the waiting time @xmath9 where it is brought back to @xmath5 .",
    "the heat flows between the cdw or sdw sample and the cold source are recorded as a function of time .",
    "ageing in the thermal response takes place even for very small values of @xmath10 . since very small temperature variations are applied in the experiment it is reasonable to suppose that the size of the correlated objects does not evolve in time and that the thermal response is due solely to the variation in the population of metastable states",
    "this can be contrasted with the coarsening dynamics where the size of correlated domains increases with time .    in a recent work@xcite we applied the idea of dynamical renormalization group@xcite to calculate the spectrum of relaxation times of a model of disordered cdw or sdw@xcite , including interactions among bisolitons .",
    "a drawback of this approach@xcite is that we supposed a coarsening dynamics following a quench from high temperature , a situation that is not realized in experiments , and we were not able to address the waiting time dependence of the relaxation time spectra .",
    "one goal of the present article is to address these issues that were left open in our previous work@xcite , and to put on a microscopic basis the random energy - like ( rem - like ) trap model that was proposed in ref .  , and",
    "inspired from trap models developed for glasses and spin glasses@xcite .",
    "more specifically we show here that heat relaxation experiments can be described by assuming two types of defects ( strong pinning and substitutional impurities ) , corresponding to the `` classical '' limit where the cdw or sdw is viewed as a classical elastic medium with bisolitons generated by strong pinning impurities distributed at random , and to the `` quantum '' limit where solitons due to substitutional disorder interact quantum mechanically by excitations of the gaped background .",
    "the existence of two effects is in agreement with the experimental observation that the low temperature out - of - equilibrium specific heat can be decomposed into three contributions : ( i ) the @xmath11 tail of a schottky anomaly at very low temperature ( typically for @xmath12  mk ; the upper bound depends on the amplitude of the @xmath13 contribution ) ; ( ii ) a @xmath1 power - law specific heat with @xmath14 at intermediate temperatures ( @xmath15  k ) ; and ( iii ) the `` trivial '' contribution of phonons @xmath16 at high temperature ( @xmath17  k ) . by schottky anomaly",
    "we mean that the equilibrium specific heat of a two - level system with energies @xmath18 and @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 having a maximum ( called a schottky anomaly ) at @xmath21 .",
    "the specific heat is approximately equal to @xmath22 in the large temperature tail .",
    "following ref .  , the contribution ( i ) is interpreted in terms of two - level systems due to strong pinning impurities .",
    "the contribution ( ii ) is interpreted as midgap states interacting through friedel oscillations .",
    "friedel oscillations of a single impurity were probed directly by x - ray diffraction experiments in ref .  .",
    "another evidence in favor of the coexistence of strong pinning and substitutional impurities is that the cdw compound o - tas@xmath3 can be doped by nb , a substitutional impurity .",
    "this changes only the amplitude of the @xmath23 contribution , but leaves unchanged the @xmath11 contribution@xcite , suggesting that the power - law contribution is related to substitutional disorder .",
    "even though not affected by substitutional disorder we do not interpret the @xmath11 as a property of the pure compound .",
    "a nuclear hyperfine interaction can be excluded from the systematic study of many different cdw compounds@xcite .",
    "we thus relate the @xmath11 contribution to strong pinning impurities@xcite , even though the microscopic nature of these impurities is not well understood experimentally ( see ref .   for a study of esr spectroscopy in o - tas@xmath3 ) .    the commensurate organic spin - peierls compound ( tmttf)@xmath24pf@xmath25 showing slow relaxation@xcite contrasts with the inorganic spin - peierls compound cu@xmath26zn@xmath27geo@xmath3@xcite showing antiferromagnetic ordering .",
    "we argue that the difference lies in the different nature of disorder .",
    "substitutional disorder relevant to cu@xmath26zn@xmath27geo@xmath3 is qualitatively different from strong pinning impurities in cdws and sdws .",
    "the spin - peierls compound cu@xmath26zn@xmath27geo@xmath3 has a fast dynamics , with a `` microscopic '' time presumably comparable to the one of spin glasses ( @xmath28 sec ) whereas in cdw and sdw compounds we have @xmath29 sec for the thermally activated process .",
    "this indicates that rather different mechanisms are at work , identified here are substitutional or strong pinning disorder .",
    "we generalize to the incommensurate case the model of substitutional disorder introduced in ref .  .",
    "in this model the solitons are due to domain walls between two degenerate ground states since the impurity site can be removed from the chain ( see ref .   and section  [ sec : quantum ] ) , therefore leaving randomly distributed domain walls in the chain from which the impurities sites have been removed .",
    "the specificity of this model ( as opposed to the strong pinning model ) is that there are no metastable states of bisolitons like in the strong pinning model .",
    "the substitutional impurities do not contribute to the slow dynamics of bisolitons in the strong pinning limit but are expected to contribute to collective pinning of the phase of the density wave .",
    "however we consider here temperatures much lower than the glass transition temperature@xcite so that interactions among solitons are the only remaining collective effects . for substitutional disorder",
    "we find interactions among solitons due to friedel oscillations .",
    "we obtain similarly to ref .   a power - law specific heat @xmath30 and a susceptibility @xmath31 in agreement with existing experiments on the cdw o - tas@xmath3@xcite .",

    "we deduce the concentration of intrinsic substitutional impurities @xmath249 .",
    "the upper bound is comparable to the nominal concentration of extrinsic nb impurities @xmath250 which might explain why the exponent @xmath114 in the experiment is the same in the presence or absence of extrinsic impurities .",
    "to conclude we have investigated several factors involved in energy relaxation in disordered cdws and sdws .",
    "a first factor is the role of commensuration . in the commensurate case",
    "we find that the energy landscape is symmetric since the symmetry @xmath251 of the cdw hamiltonian is preserved by the impurity potential . as a consequence",
    "the two energy minima are degenerate , a property that can be obtained by a direct solution of the sine - gordon equation .",
    "we have shown that the degeneracy exists for an arbitrary number of impurities contributing to pinning the bisoliton .",
    "experimentally there exists also slow relaxation in commensurate systems , even though faster than in the incommensurate case .",
    "the fully classical model might be too schematic since the exact degeneracy of the classical model is lifted by quantum tunneling .",
    "nevertheless it succeeds to explain the @xmath252 specific heat and the waiting time dependence of the prefactor in the incommensurate case .",
    "we have proposed a model of clustering in which the pinning energy is additive if two impurities are at a distance smaller than the width @xmath47 of the soliton .",
    "the barrier distribution is exponential , with therefore a power - law relaxation compatible with experiments ( see ref .  ) .",
    "however bisolitons can be depinned in sequence , not simultaneously .",
    "this is described qualitatively by the dynamical renormalization group@xcite . within this treatment",
    "we obtain also a power - law relaxation but with an upper cut - off in the spectrum of relaxation times , in agreement with experiments .",
    "the clustering model is nevertheless useful for addressing qualitatively the waiting time effect in the specific ageing protocol used in experiments .",
    "finally we discussed another important factor : the nature of disorder at the level of a single soliton and the possibility of quantum interactions among solitons that might explain the differences between the spin - peierls compound cu@xmath26zn@xmath27geo@xmath3 that does not show slow relaxation and orders antiferromagnetically , and the spin - peierls compound ( tmttf)@xmath24pf@xmath25 that shows slow relaxation without antiferromagnetic order .",
    "for this purpose we have generalized to incommensurate systems a model of substitutional disorder originally introduced for spin - peierls systems@xcite .",
    "we first treated the case of a strong pinning impurity potential and found that the energy spectrum of a single quantum mechanical soliton is constant as the position of the soliton varies along the chain in the commensurate case , whereas it varies in the incommensurate case .",
    "interactions among solitons enhance disorder effects in the incommensurate case .",
    "we thus find a qualitative difference between the commensurate and incommensurate cases in the quantum limit . for substitutional disorder in the quantum limit",
    "we find interactions among solitons due to friedel oscillations .",
    "this can explain the experimentally observed power - law contribution to the specific heat in inorganic cdws and sdws in the limit of weak interchain couplings .",
    "the final picture for organic sdws and cdws is a coexistence between strong pinning and substitutional disorder as well as a a coexistence between classical and quantum effects .",
    "further investigations would require a model of collective effects interpolating between the classical and quantum limits .",
    "another ingredient that we did not discuss in detail is metallic island formed around impurities@xcite that would lead to a phenomenology close to that of substitutional disorder because both generate states at the fermi level for an isolated impurity , that can interact through friedel oscillations .",
    "finally , we have developed here the point of view of including collective effects from the strong pinning limit .",
    "the specific heat including quantum effects in the weak pinning regime was discussed recently@xcite .",
    "the authors acknowledge fruitful discussions with p. monceau . k.b . acknowledges funding by cnrs through a temporary position of associate researcher .",
    "the authors thank one of the referees for useful comments on the first version of the manuscript .",
    "we use the peierls hamiltonian for charge degrees of freedom , the electronic part of which is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : h - peierls ] ) , where spinless fermions jump between neighboring sites on a 1d chain .",
