    "we normally detect galaxies by observing luminous stars . although luminous stars are only one of the constituents which make up galaxies , we hope to understand their internal properties and their evolution from the observations of luminous stars .",
    "the ultimate goal is to map out the star formation history of the universe from the end of the cosmic ` dark age ' to the present epoch , and constrain the growth of cosmic structure .",
    "one then starts off by observing galaxies first in the optical wavelength where the atmospheric windows are open to ground - based telescopes , and move on to other wavelengths aiming to map out the entire electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "an obvious way to estimate the sfr from optical observations is to take advantage of the fact that the bulk of the rest - frame uv - emission from galaxies is dominated by the short - lived high - mass stars , and to assume that the cosmic sfr is proportional to the rest - frame uv - luminosity density of galaxies at each epoch of the universe",
    ".    many measurements of various sfr indicator at different redshifts have been published within the past few years , and our understanding of the cosmic sfr is evolving rapidly .",
    "@xcite  ( 1996 , hereafter l96 ) have shown that the sfr appears to be rising rapidly from @xmath1 to 1 as a function of redshift using the canada france redshift survey ( cfrs ) .",
    "@xcite  ( 1996 , hereafter m96 ) used the hubble deep field ( hdf , @xcite  1996 ) to infer the sfr at high - redshift and obtained the sfr at @xmath3 .",
    "they further went on to obtain the sfr at @xmath10 , which suggested that the sfr could be decreasing towards high - redshift ( @xmath11 ; @xcite  1997 , hereafter m97 ) .",
    "this result , combined with the studies at @xmath12 ( @xcite  1996 ; @xcite  1997 , hereafter c97 ; @xcite  1998 ; @xcite  1998 ) , suggested that the sfr may have a peak at @xmath13 , and spurred the excitement that we might have detected the peak of the star formation activity in the history of the universe .",
    "the figure plotting the sfr as a function of redshift has since been called as the `` madau plot '' and gained popularity . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite  ( 1997 ) and @xcite  ( 1998 ) obtained higher sfrs than m96 and m97 , and suggested that the sfr might be constant beyond @xmath14 .",
    "the most recent publication of the sfr at high - redshift ( @xmath11 ) comes from @xcite  ( 1999 , hereafter s99 ) who used the lyman - break technique to detect galaxies at @xmath15 to 4 .",
    "they found more star formation at @xmath16 than m96 and m97 did .",
    "they have also shown that the work of m96 and m97 might have missed some fraction of the galaxies due to an inappropriate color - cut on the color - color plane of the hdf galaxies .",
    "thus , the results of m96 and m97 should be regarded as lower limits to the true sfr .",
    "however , the discussion does not end here .",
    "in addition to the observational difficulty in determining the faint end of the luminosity function which makes the resulting sfr unreliable , the uv - emission from high - mass stars is significantly obscured by dust which exists in and around the galaxies .",
    "dust absorbs the uv - emission from high - mass stars and re - emits the energy at longer wavelengths , fir to submm .",
    "thus the sfr inferred from the uv - emission detected in the optical observations is only a part of the true star formation , i.e. , there is significant `` hidden '' star formation .    to reveal this hidden portion of the true star formation",
    ", observers have been making great progress using the sub - millimeter common user bolometer array ( scuba ) on the james clark maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) at hawaii .",
    "the scuba observations at @xmath17 have already revealed hidden star formation which was previously not detected by the uv - observations , and suggest higher sfr in the past where star formation was more active than the present . however , a quantitative deduction of hidden sfr is still difficult from their observations due to the limited spatial resolution of the telescope ( @xcite  1999 ; @xcite  1999 ) .",
    "further observations in the infrared wavelength are also important .",
    "we will discuss this issue further in   [ dust ] .    in order to gain a better understanding of the physical mechanism that affects the sfr ,",
    "several groups have approached this subject from the theoretical side using dissipationless n - body simulations and semi - analytic models of galaxy formation (  @xcite  1991 ; @xcite  1993 ; @xcite  1998 , hereafter b98 ; @xcite  1998 , hereafter sp98 ) .",
    "they have succeeded in drawing a picture roughly consistent with observations by using an appropriate stellar evolution model and exploring the luminosity density as a function of redshift . however , in these semi - analytic models , one has to follow the dissipative physical processes by putting in a model under simplified assumptions for the dynamics of galaxy formation .",
    "as @xcite  ( 1999 ) and sp98 note , there are significant uncertainties in their modeling of star formation and supernova feedback in the sense that the final observable outcome changes significantly by changing the free parameters in the model ( see sp98 for the list of free parameters and a nice comparison of different models ) .",
    "this is of course due to our ignorance of these complicated dissipative processes that take place during galaxy formation .",
    "one additional advantage of the semi - analytic approach is that it can search through a vast parameter space in a moderate amount of time .",
    "although the basic uncertainty of the fundamental parameters in modeling these processes is similar , it is useful to carry out a detailed hydrodynamical simulation because it treats the dynamics of the products of these dissipative physical processes directly by following the behavior of the baryonic gas dynamically .",
    "many important physical processes which we might not understand well enough to include in heuristic treatments (  relative motion of dark matter and baryonic components ) are included automatically when the full set of equations is solved . in particular , in semi - analytic models , the intergalactic medium or outskirts of galaxies are treated inaccurately in the sense that the shock - heating in these regions is largely ignored .",
    "the simulations we use here are specially designed to capture the shock regions well using the total variation diminishing method ( @xcite  1993 ) . however , due to its high computational requirement , the resolution of our large - scale hydrodynamical simulations has not reached the same level of that of the dissipationless dark matter simulations yet .",
    "thus , the above two approaches are both important and complementary to each other .    in this paper , we present the results of the computation of the cosmic sfr and the comoving rest - frame luminosity density of galaxies at various wavelengths ( 1500@xmath18 , 2800@xmath18 , u , b , v , i , k - bands ) using a @xmath0cdm hydrodynamical simulation ( @xcite  1999a , b , c , d , hereafter co99a , b , c , d ) .",
    "details of the simulation are explained in   [ simulation ] and in appendix  [ criteria ] , indicating improvements over prior versions .    in ",
    "[ sfr ] , we calculate the cosmic sfr by simply summing up the mass of the collapsed baryonic objects formed in the simulation within a given time according to the star formation recipe explained in   [ simulation ] and in appendix  [ criteria ] .",
    "we note that the sfr is a straight - forward and direct outcome of the star formation recipe and the input parameters that we implement in the simulation .    in   [ lumdensity ] , we calculate the comoving rest - frame luminosity density using the updated isochrone synthesis code by @xcite  ( 1993,1999 , hereafter bc99 ) which takes the metallicity variation into account .",
    "note that many of the earlier works which used population synthesis models have often assumed a constant solar metallicity in their calculations .    in   [ discussion ] , we consider possible corrections that can be applied to the raw result of our calculation to compensate for the inappropriate input parameters and the effect of dust extinction .",
    "the first correction (   [ baryon ] ) is for the baryonic mass - density @xmath19 which will be matched to the current best estimate value .",
    "the second (   [ yield ] ) is the correction of the yield of metals .",
    "we adjusted the value so that the simulations reproduce the observed intra - cluster gas metallicity .",
    "the third (   [ dust ] ) is the dust extinction correction to account for the hidden sfr . for the purpose of illustration",
    ", we consider a very simple model of dust extinction by introducing a parameter @xmath4 which is the fraction of the total _",
    "luminosity _ that is heavily obscured : the entire optical emission from stars of this fraction is completely absorbed by dust and re - radiated in the fir - to - submm wavelengths .",
    "note that this is _ not _ the fraction of the _ galaxy population _",
    ", we are only referring to the _ luminosity _ itself for reasons to be explained in   [ dust ] . as the aim of this paper",
    "is not to construct a detailed model of dust , we satisfy ourselves by seeing that the calculated intrinsic luminosity density can be corrected to the observed one with a reasonable value of this parameter @xmath4 .",
    "we refer to various observations to obtain a reasonable value of @xmath4 such as the local b - band luminosity density and the extragalactic background light .",
    "finally , we consider the physical origin of the computed `` madau plot '' in   [ madauplot ] and discuss the possible effect of the resolution in   [ resolution ]",
    ", then conclude in   [ conclusion ] .",
    "the hydrodynamical cosmological simulations that we use here are also described in detail in co99a , b , d ; they are similar to but greatly improved over those of @xcite  ( 1992a , b ) . motivated by @xcite  ( 1995 ) ,",
    "the adopted cosmological parameters are @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 where @xmath25 , and 25@xmath26 tensor mode contribution to the cosmic microwave background fluctuations on large scales .",
    "this model is consistent with the recent high - redshift supernova observations which suggest the existence of the cosmological constant @xmath27 (  @xcite  1998 ; @xcite  1998 ) .",
    "the present age of the universe with these input parameters is 12.7 gyrs .",
    "we have two simulations with comoving box sizes of @xmath28 , each having @xmath29 cells and @xmath30 dark matter particles with masses of @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "the _ comoving _ cell sizes are @xmath32 , respectively . at redshift 3 ,",
    "the mass resolution is unchanged but the spatial resolution is @xmath33 in two boxes , respectively .",
    "the code is implemented with a star formation recipe summarized in appendix  [ criteria ] .",
    "it turns a part of the baryonic gas in a cell into a collisionless particle ( hereafter `` galaxy particle '' ) once the following criteria are met simultaneously : 1 ) the cell is overdense ( @xmath34 ) , 2 ) the cooling time of the gas @xmath35 in the cell is shorter than its dynamical time @xmath36 , 3 ) the mass of the gas in the cell @xmath37 is larger than the jeans mass @xmath38 , and 4 ) the gas flow is converging into the cell .",
    "each galaxy particle has a number of attributes at birth , including position , velocity , formation time , mass , and initial gas metallicity . upon its formation",
    ", the mass of a galaxy particle is determined by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the current time - step in the simulation and @xmath41 .",
    "the galaxy particle is placed at the center of the cell after its formation with a velocity equal to the mean velocity of the gas , and followed by the particle - mesh code thereafter as collisionless particles in gravitational coupling with dark matter and gas .",
    "the galaxy particles are baryonic galactic subunits with mass ranging from @xmath42 to @xmath43 ( most of them having @xmath44 ) , therefore , a collection of these particles is regarded as a galaxy .",
    "however , here we do not group them since we are only interested in the averaged emissivity of those particles and grouping is irrelevant .",
    "the number of galaxy particles at redshift zero is about @xmath45 million for the @xmath46 box .",
    "feedback processes such as ionizing uv , supernova ( sn ) energy , and metal ejection are also included self - consistently .",
    "the sn and the uv feedback from young stars are treated as follows : @xmath47 and @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the orion - like normalized spectrum of a young stellar association taken from @xcite  ( 1986 ) , and ( @xmath50 ) are the efficiency parameters taken as ( @xmath51 ) , respectively ( @xcite  1992a , b ; @xcite  1993 ) .",
    "the @xmath52 is added locally in a cell , and the @xmath53 is averaged over the box .",
    "the metals are created according to @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the mass of the metals , @xmath56 is the yield , and @xmath57 is the mass of the galaxy particle .",
    "they are ejected back into the inter - galactic medium and followed as a separate variable by the same hydro - code which follows the gas density .",
    "the initial input parameter for the yield was @xmath58 which we will later correct to a lower value in   [ yield ] .",
    "as we explained in the previous section and in appendix  [ criteria ] , stars are formed from baryonic gas as they cool and gravitationally collapse in the simulation .",
    "this recipe enables us to calculate the cosmic sfr as a direct output of the simulation ; simply sum up the mass of the stars formed within a given amount of time . calculated in this manner",
    ", the sfr as a function of redshift is shown in ( the ` madau plot ' ) .",
    "here we assumed that stars form instantaneously once a galaxy particle forms according to the recipe in appendix  [ criteria ] .",
    "an alternative model is to assume that the collapsed baryons turn into stars gradually over the period of @xmath59 years in the spirit of @xcite  ( 1962 ) . in this picture , the galaxy particle formed is still a mixture of stars and dense gas clouds which quickly turns into stars with the above time - scale .",
    "however , the resulting sfr from this model is not very different from the instantaneous burst model except that the sfr at high redshift ( @xmath60 ) is a little lower since some part of the star formation is delayed to later times .",
    "thus , we will assume the instantaneous starburst model hereafter ; that all of the mass of a galaxy particle turn into stars instantaneously upon its formation .",
    "together with the raw computed sfr from the two boxes , we also show the extinction corrected data points in .",
    "we corrected the original published values ( l96 , m96 , c97 , m97 , @xcite  1997 , @xcite  1998 , @xcite  1998 , s99 ) by following the same prescription as s99 , that is , to multiply by a factor of 4.7 ( for @xmath61 data points ) and 2.7 ( for @xmath62 data ) according to the @xcite  ( 1997 ) extinction law and use @xmath63=8.0\\times10^{27}$ ] sfr [ @xmath64/yr ] for the conversion from uv - luminosity density to sfr .",
    "we note that @xcite  ( 1998 ) obtained this conversion factor for the salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) with mass - cutoff of @xmath65{m_{\\odot}}$ ] at @xmath66 under the assumption of exponentially decaying sfr for each galaxy . here , the data points of s99 at @xmath67 and 4 include an additional factor of 1.7 which should be included if one is to integrate the luminosity function all the way down to zero instead of down to @xmath68 as explained in s99 .",
    "we have also corrected all the data points for our cosmology : from @xmath69 ( in which most observers present their results ) to our @xmath70 case .",
    "this correction shifts the data points downward overall , but not more than 0.25 in @xmath71 , when the increase in both absolute luminosity and effective comoving volume are taken into account for given apparent luminosity and number density of galaxies . as a consequence , the rise in the luminosity density from @xmath1 to 1 is suppressed compared to the einstein - de - sitter universe ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "the two almost - parallel curves in are for the two different boxes ( @xmath73 and 100@xmath74 ) of the simulation ; the curve of 50@xmath74 box lies higher .",
    "@xcite  ( 1999 ) also observe that the amount of stars formed in similar simulations increases as they increase the resolution .",
    "the results of the simulation should converge once we reach a sufficient resolution and better understanding of the physics of star formation .",
    "however , given the current level of sophistication of the simulation and our poor understanding of the star formation processes itself , it is clear that we are still far away from this ideal goal .",
    "the total amount of stars created in the simulation also depends on several ingredients of the simulation , such as the feedback parameters described in   [ simulation ] and the amplitude of the primordial power spectrum at small - scales .",
    "although the ambiguity remains , it is still worthwhile to discuss the mass - density of stars @xmath75 that were created in the simulation . in our simulation",
    ", we find @xmath76 and @xmath77 where the upper index refers to the size of the simulation box and the lower index `` raw '' represents that this is the raw result without any corrections that may arise due to the inappropriate input parameters .",
    "the observed @xmath75 is still uncertain and ranges from 0.002 to 0.006 in the literature (  @xcite  1999 ) .",
    "our raw result of the stellar mass - density may be too high , however , this is the result under the assumption of @xmath22 .",
    "we will discuss how this value would change if we were to scale @xmath19 to the current best estimate in ",
    "[ baryon ] .",
    "the steep falloff of the sfr from @xmath7 to 0 will be discussed in   [ madauplot ] .",
    "we now calculate the emissivity of the galaxy particles using the instantaneous burst model of the isochrone synthesis code gissel99 ( bc99 ) .",
    "the input from the simulation is the formation time , the mass and the metallicity of each galaxy particle .",
    "we calculate the emissivity of all the galaxy particles , sum them up at each epoch and divide by the total volume of the simulation box .",
    "we do this exercise with three different imfs ; salpeter ( 1955 ) , scalo ( 1986 ) , and miller - scalo ( 1979 ) .",
    "we find that the salpeter imf produces the result that best matches the observations of galaxy luminosity density , so we will use the salpeter imf with mass - cutoff of @xmath78{m_{\\odot}}$ ] in the rest of this paper .    in",
    ", we show the raw result of the calculated uv - luminosity density of the 50@xmath74 box at 1500@xmath18 , 2800@xmath18 and in the u - band .",
    "naturally , the shape of the uv - luminosity density curve is similar to that of the sfr .",
    "one should keep in mind that , as s99 point out , the error - bars of the high - redshift data points are under - estimated and will be much larger when the uncertainties in the shape of the luminosity function at unobserved magnitudes is taken into account .    likewise , in , we show the raw result of the calculated galaxy luminosity density of the 50@xmath74 box at longer wavelengths : b , v , i , and k - band .",
    "we plot the data points by @xcite  ( 1997 ) who re - analyzed the hubble deep field ( hdf ) photometric redshift data using 7 colors , whereas they only used 4 colors in their previous work ( @xcite  1997 ) .",
    "however , as they point out , the discrepancy between the results of the two analyses can be viewed as an indication of the systematic uncertainties involved in the analysis of this kind .",
    "all the data points in both figures are corrected for the adopted cosmology as we have explained in the previous section .",
    "some of the previous works on the sfr limited the analysis by assuming a constant solar metallicity for all galaxies when calculating the luminosity density using population synthesis models .",
    "we find that the inclusion of the metallicity gradient for galaxies is important to obtain the correct rate of decline in the luminosity density from @xmath7 to 0 in our simulation .",
    "therefore , the full dynamical treatment of gas and metals in our simulation is an important advantage over the ad hoc treatment of these components in the semi - analytic models of galaxy formation .    in and [ fig3.ps ] ,",
    "the raw calculated result is significantly above the observations .",
    "we will now discuss the corrections that can be applied to the raw calculated result in the next section .",
    "in this section , we consider the corrections of our input parameters of the simulation and the dust extinction which can be applied to the raw calculated results presented in the earlier sections . after explaining each correction , we show the corrected figures which are now consistent with the observed luminosity density of galaxies in the uv - to - nearir range .",
    "the original input value of the baryon mass - density @xmath19 for our simulations was 0.049 .",
    "the current best - estimate of this value is 0.039 ( @xmath79 with @xmath24 ; @xcite  1999 ; @xcite  2000 ) .",
    "so , how does the sfr change as a function of @xmath19 ?    in our code",
    ", the radiative cooling rate is proportional to the square of the local baryonic mass - density times a function of temperature @xmath80 and metallicity @xmath81 : @xmath82 where u is the internal energy of the gas .",
    "so , the cooled mass in our computation goes as @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the mass of stars produced , @xmath85v is the volume element and @xmath85 t is the time step .",
    "that is , in a given time and volume element , the amount of mass turned into stars approximately scales as @xmath86 .",
    "thus , when we perform the simulation over again in test cases using @xmath87 , rather than 0.049 , we would have expected that the sfr would go down approximately by a factor @xmath88 .",
    "this scaling is not exact because , in the higher @xmath19 run , the metallicity is higher and cooling increases for that reason as well .",
    "but this latter effect is small at the temperatures @xmath89 k and metallicities @xmath90 which are most important ( @xmath91 is the solar metallicity ) .",
    "when the stellar mass is scaled with this factor @xmath92 , the calculated sfr shows a better fit with the observations in .",
    "the calculated luminosity density by gissel99 also have to be scaled down by the same factor since it is linearly proportional to the stellar mass in the simulation ( and [ fig6.ps ] include this correction ) .",
    "accordingly , the stellar mass - density we discussed in   [ sfr ] also goes down by the factor of @xmath92 ; @xmath93 and @xmath94 which are now closer to the current best estimate ( @xmath95 , @xcite  1999 ) .",
    "the remaining possible over - production of stars in our simulations can be explained by the high initial input value of the yield which will be discussed in the next subsection .",
    "the @xmath19 correction also affects the metallicity in the simulation since it changes the stellar mass by a factor of @xmath92 and the gas density by a factor of @xmath96 .",
    "thus , the metallicity , defined as the ratio of the amount of mass in metals to the total baryonic mass for a given region , is changed by a factor of @xmath97 .",
    "this correction factor for the metallicity will be used in the next subsection .",
    "next , we consider the correction of the input value of the yield of metals .",
    "the original input value of the yield in our simulations was @xmath58 which simply was a typo - graphical error .",
    "we would like to scale this value so that we reproduce the observed value of the gas metallicity within clusters of galaxies , namely @xmath98 ( @xcite  1997 ) . in order to identify clusters in the simulation",
    ", we grouped the galaxy particles using the hop algorithm ( @xcite  1999 ) and calculated the average gas metallicity within 1@xmath74 around the center of the cluster . taking only the clusters with galactic mass of @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the solar mass , we found the mass - weighted mean of the intra - cluster gas metallicity to be @xmath101 for the 50@xmath74 box ( @xmath102 for the 100@xmath74 box ) .",
    "thus , the correction factor @xmath103 for the yield of 50@xmath74 box would be @xmath104 which gives the the cluster normalized yield of @xmath105 .",
    "the yield correction of course changes the amount of metals itself .",
    "together with the @xmath19 correction described in the previous subsection , the metallicity in the simulation has to be multiplied by a factor of @xmath106 .",
    "we have used the corrected metallicity in computing and [ fig6.ps ] .",
    "these figures also include the effect of dust extinction which will be discussed in the next subsection .",
    "there is one important caveat that goes with the change in the metallicity .",
    "since metals play a role in the cooling , it is related to the star formation criteria through the cooling time ( see equation ( a3 ) in appendix  [ criteria ] ) .",
    "more metals make the cooling time shorter by efficient metal cooling , thereby , resulting in the higher rate of star formation .",
    "if the initial input value of the yield of metals was reasonably low , this was expected to be not a significant effect in the simulation because most of the galaxy particles form from the gas whose metallicity is lower than @xmath107 where metal cooling is not so important . however , our initial input value of the yield was a little high which may be the reason for the possible over - production of stars in our simulation compared to the current observational estimate of the stellar mass - density as we discussed in   [ baryon ] .",
    "this effect on cooling efficiency is complex , so we do not attempt to correct for this .    to be consistent in our computation of luminosity density , we should use the same yield for both the simulation and gissel99 .",
    "let us now estimate the yield assumed in the gissel99 . in the model of gissel99 we used , the salpeter imf with mass cutoff of [ 0.1 , 100]@xmath100 was assumed . by assuming the imf , one is setting the number of high - mass stars for a given total stellar mass , hence the yield as well . to make a rough estimate of the yield for this imf",
    ", we refer to @xcite  ( 1996 ) where he calculates the mass at least processed through helium burning . dividing this value by the integral of the salpeter imf in the mass - range specified above",
    ", we obtain the yield of this model of gissel99 to be @xmath108 .",
    "this value is close enough to @xmath109 within the level of uncertainty we are dealing with .      as we explained in ",
    "[ introduction ] , a significant portion of the bolometric luminosity of galaxies is reprocessed by dust from optical to fir wavelength . for the purpose of illustration , we consider a very simple model of dust extinction by introducing a parameter @xmath4 which characterizes the hidden fraction of the star formation .",
    "this is the fraction of the total bolometric luminosity of stars which is heavily obscured by dust ( the effective optical depth in v - band @xmath110 ) and only appears in the fir .",
    "the rest of the fraction @xmath111 is only moderately obscured by dust ( @xmath112 as suggested by @xcite  1990 ) .",
    "note that we intentionally avoided calling @xmath4 the fraction of the galaxy population obscured by dust .",
    "it is often assumed that star formation takes place in two distinct populations of galaxies , one relatively unaffected by dust and the other completely obscured .",
    "this is _ not _ the picture we have in mind here , we are only referring to the fraction of the total _ luminosity _ emitted by stars .",
    "this is because for example some galaxies may have a star - bursting region in its very dusty central core , and the rest of its body may contain only moderate amount of dust .",
    "in fact , @xcite  ( 2000 ) show that the majority of the star formation is taking place in galaxies which contain moderate amount of dust , disfavoring the clear - cut two distinct population model .",
    "our definition of the parameter @xmath4 strictly means the following : if we collect all the high - mass stars that are forming in the universe , the fraction @xmath4 of them are in heavily obscured region and the rest of the fraction @xmath111 is in moderately obscured region for which the obscuration is correctly estimated by steidel and others .",
    "since the fraction of stars in heavily obscured regions contribute little in the uv and optical wavelengths , we must estimate their numbers by other means .    as the aim of this paper is not to construct a detailed model of dust ,",
    "we satisfy ourselves by seeing that the raw calculated luminosity density can be corrected to the observed one with a reasonable value of @xmath4 .",
    "we now refer to various observations to infer the appropriate value of @xmath4 , and discuss the consistency between them and our simulation .",
    "@xcite  ( 2000 ) observed low - redshift starburst galaxies using the infrared space observatory ( iso ) and found that only about 30@xmath26 of the bolometric flux is coming out in the uv - to - nearir wavelength range ; the rest is emitted in the fir .",
    "this suggests @xmath113 if their sample is typical in our universe .",
    "they also found the following : 1 ) the fir spectral energy distributions of the starburst galaxies are best fitted by a combination of two modified planck functions , with @xmath114 ( warm dust ) and @xmath115 ( cool dust ) .",
    "the emission from this cold dust can be a major contributor to the fir emission of starburst galaxies .",
    "2 ) because the wavelength coverage of the iras survey is @xmath116 , the iras observations alone are not adequate for characterizing the emission from dust cooler than @xmath117 , which could be a major contributor to the total dust mass content of a galaxy . on the other hand ,",
    "the iso satellite covers up to @xmath118 and thus is capable of revealing the fir emission from the cold dust component .",
    "the resulting total fir emission in the range of @xmath119 m is about twice larger than the iras fir emission in the range @xmath120 m .",
    "@xcite  ( 1990 ) estimated the fir luminosity density of the iras galaxies to be @xmath121 . in order to compensate for the incomplete wavelength coverage of the iras survey",
    ", this value has to be scaled up by a factor of @xmath122 to obtain the correct fir luminosity density according to @xcite  ( 2000 ) , which results in @xmath123 .    in our simulation",
    ", we find the bolometric luminosity density of galaxies to be @xmath124 where the upper index denotes the size of the simulation box . as an example",
    ", let us take @xmath5 and multiply this factor to @xmath125 to obtain the heavily obscured component which entirely goes into the fir range : we get @xmath126 . agreement within a factor of a few is adequate given the uncertainty in our model .",
    "another line of evidence for the high fraction of the hidden star formation relative to the visible one in the uv comes from the submm observations .",
    "although quantitative constraints are still difficult to make from the submm observations as we described in   [ introduction ] , a recent statistical analysis of the hdf observation in the submm range suggests that as much as 80@xmath26 of the star formation could be hidden by dust ( @xcite  1999 ) .    for the rest of the fraction ( @xmath127 )",
    "which is only moderately obscured , we use a standard galactic extinction curve of @xcite  ( 1984 ) with standard mrn parameters , attenuating the light by a factor of @xmath128 where we take the effective optical depth at v - band @xmath129 .",
    "for this moderately obscured component , a consistency check with observation can be done with the local b - band galaxy luminosity density .",
    "@xcite  ( 1988 ) obtained @xmath130 using various galaxy surveys , and more recently @xcite  ( 1996 ) got a consistent result from the autofib redshift survey . in our simulation , we find @xmath131 after applying the yield correction @xmath132 and the dust extinction correction . agreement within a factor of a few is adequate given the uncertainty in our model .",
    "another important observation that complements the observations of the local universe is the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) .",
    "a photon of frequency @xmath133 emitted from a star at a certain redshift @xmath134 arrives at the earth with the redshifted frequency @xmath135 .",
    "the entire history of the light emitted from stars in our universe is then recorded as the ebl : i_=^_0_^ dz where @xmath136 [ erg / sec / hz/@xmath137/sr ] is the ebl at redshifted frequency @xmath138 , @xmath139 is the rest - frame luminosity density at frequency @xmath138 , and @xmath140 is the cosmological line element .",
    "one can integrate @xmath136 with frequency and obtain the integrated ebl ( @xmath141 ) often expressed in units of [ nw/@xmath142/sr ] or as @xmath143 .    on the observational side , in the optical wavelength range",
    ", one can simply calculate the ebl from the observed fluxes of galaxies in the hdf .",
    "@xcite  ( 1998 ) obtained the lower limit of the optical ebl using the hdf in the range of @xmath144 .",
    "later @xcite  ( 2000 , hereafter m00 ) extended the source of data and obtained the optical ebl intensity of @xmath145 nw/@xmath142/sr .",
    "one should keep in mind that the estimates from the integrated fluxes from resolved galaxies will typically be low because of the systematic errors ( see m00 ) , and must be strictly considered as lower limits . on the other hand , the direct observation by @xcite  ( 1999 ) gives a total optical ebl intensity of @xmath146 nw/@xmath142/sr in the range of @xmath147 after the correction for the systematic errors .",
    "this could even become @xmath148 nw/@xmath142/sr if the same systematic correction applies to the near - ir , and is higher than the integrated light from galaxies by a factor of @xmath149 ( see m00 ) .",
    "other constraints from the source - subtracted sky is discussed by @xcite  ( 1997 ) and references therein .    in the fir wavelength range , the cobe / firas measurements in the @xmath150 range ( @xcite  1998 ) and the dirbe detection at 140 and 240 @xmath151 m ( @xcite  1998 ; @xcite  1998 ) suggest the approximate value for the fir background is @xmath152 nw/@xmath142/sr .",
    "a study by @xcite  ( 1998 ) and dirbe measurements at 2.2 and 3.5 @xmath151 m ( @xcite  1999 ) suggest @xmath153 nw/@xmath142/sr in the range of @xmath154 . combining all these measurements",
    ", m00 gave the ` best - guess ' total ebl intensity observed today as @xmath155 nw/@xmath142/sr .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite  ( 2000 ) recently reported somewhat higher @xmath156 at 60 and 100 @xmath151 m compared to the previous estimates from the analysis of dirbe data - set , which may increase the contribution from the fir range to the total budget of @xmath141 .",
    "another study by @xcite  ( 2000 ) , using all the currently available observational constraints , suggests the total ebl of @xmath157 nw/@xmath142/sr .",
    "both of these two recent works support the view that @xmath6 of the total stellar emission is reprocessed by dust and emitted in the fir range .    in our simulation",
    ", we obtain the total ebl of @xmath158 nw/@xmath142/sr after the corrections described in previous sections , consistent with the most recent estimate of @xcite  ( 2000 ) . taking the value @xmath5 for the hidden sfr which entirely emits in the fir - to - submm range , and with the moderate obscuration of @xmath129 for the rest of the 35@xmath26 , our estimate from the simulation",
    "is @xmath159 nw/@xmath142/sr and @xmath160 nw/@xmath142/sr . the numbers from the simulation and the observations are consistent with each other within their uncertainties .      assuming that 65@xmath26 of the total stellar emission is heavily obscured and completely reprocessed by dust from optical to fir wavelength , and that the rest of the 35@xmath26 moderately obscured with the effective optical depth of @xmath129",
    ", we obtain the best match between our calculation and the observed uv - to - nearir galaxy luminosity density . although the fit is not perfect , considering both the observational and theoretical uncertainties , agreement within a factor of a few is adequate .    using the corrected metallicity and the stellar mass as described in the previous subsections , we re -",
    "calculate the galaxy luminosity density from our simulation and obtain and [ fig6.ps ] after dust extinction correction .",
    "they are now in good agreement with the observational data shown .",
    "thus , our simulation is consistent with the picture that @xmath161 2/3 of the total stellar emission is heavily obscured by dust , and can only be observed in the fir - to - submm .",
    "the rest of the 35@xmath26 is moderately obscured , and can be observed in the uv - to - near - ir range .",
    "a significant portion of the heavily obscured fraction of the total light was previously missed by the iras , and it is now starting to be resolved by the iso observations as explained in   [ iso ] .      in this section ,",
    "we discuss the falloff of the sfr from @xmath7 to 0 .",
    "this sharp dropoff of the sfr at low - redshift was first pointed out by l96 .",
    "however , @xcite  ( 1999 ) argue that the l96 results has two weaknesses : first , it is a red selected sample which requires a substantial extrapolation to obtain uv - luminosity density ; second , it does not sample enough of the luminosity function to allow reliable extrapolation to a total luminosity density .",
    "they argue for a shallower decline of the sfr from @xmath7 to 0 .",
    "thus , the observational evidence of the sharp dropoff of the sfr from @xmath7 to 0 is not yet conclusive , but the decline itself seems to be solid .    in and [ fig4.ps ] ,",
    "our simulations reproduce this sharp decline in sfr well .",
    "it has been known that in semi - analytic models it is difficult to reproduce this sharp dropoff from @xmath7 to 0 (  b98 ; sp98 ) .",
    "we expect that this sharpness of the decline of sfr is at least partly due to the physical effect discovered by @xcite  ( 1999 ) in the same simulation .",
    "they found that at low - redshift the highest density regions cease to contain high star formation galaxies as they are typically in deep potential - wells where the high gas temperature prevents efficient star formation .",
    "thus , the physical origin of the `` madau feature '' ( the rise and fall of the sfr ) can be explained as follows . at high - redshift ( @xmath162 ) , the gas temperature is still sufficiently low that the high - density regions are favored for star formation since they have shorter cooling time ( note @xmath163 where @xmath0 is the cooling rate ) . as it approaches to low - redshift ( @xmath164 ) , the gas temperature increases due to the shock - heating and the sn feedback in high - density regions .",
    "as a result , the cooling time in high - density regions gets longer and the star formation becomes inactive .",
    "this naturally explains the rise and fall of the cosmic sfr , and is consistent with the result of our simulation .",
    "we refer the readers to the paper by @xcite  ( 1999 ) for a more quantitative analysis .",
    "the findings of co99a also support this idea . again using the same simulations",
    ", they found that the warm ( @xmath165 ) gas which occupies 95@xmath26 of the total baryonic mass at redshift 3 is heated up into hot ( @xmath166 ; 20@xmath26 at z=0 ) and warm / hot ( @xmath167 ; 50@xmath26 at z=0 ) gas by shock - heating and sn feedback .",
    "the above arguments lead to the idea of `` sfr as a function of overdensity '' .",
    "we can demonstrate this idea in a straight - forward way by making the madau plot as a function of overdensity , which is presented elsewhere ( @xcite  2000 ) .",
    "we note that our simulation adopts the flat-@xmath0 cosmology where there is more volume at moderate redshift and longer age of the universe .",
    "@xcite  ( 1997 ) have pointed out that the @xmath0-dominated flat model is favored to reproduce the steep dropoff of the uv - luminosity density below redshift 1 .",
    "the rate of increase of the sfr from @xmath168 to 2 in our simulation is similar to that of the semi - analytic treatments by b98 and sp98 .      in this paper ,",
    "we focus on the quantities which are averaged over the simulation box so that our conclusions will suffer minimally from the resolution problem of simulations , and test the robustness of our conclusions by comparing the results with those obtained using twice the spatial and eight times the mass resolution of the larger scale simulation .",
    "one such test was performed in @xcite  ( 1999b ) where they showed that the bias and the correlation function calculated from the two boxes does not differ more than 10@xmath26 when smoothed with a gaussian window of the same radius 0.5@xmath74 , on scales @xmath169 .",
    "therefore , they concluded that the finite numerical resolution does not significantly affect the results as long as the quantities averaged over a large scale are considered .",
    "however , the simulation probably under - estimates the star formation rate with limited resolution although it is not clear by how much . on the other hand , we have over - estimated the star formation due to the high initial input value of the yield which lead to too efficient metal cooling .",
    "all these effects together , it is difficult to assess by how much we have over- or under - estimated the star formation overall .    as for the redshift dependence of the resolution ,",
    "our simulation has higher physical resolution at high - redshift relative to low - redshift as we described in   [ simulation ] .",
    "considering the fact that the higher resolution simulation produces more stars as described in   [ sfr ] , we might be under - estimating the amount of stars at low - redshift if the resolution affects the star formation seriously .",
    "thus , we can not completely rule out the possibility that the steep dropoff of the sfr from @xmath7 to 0 might have been enhanced due to the poorer resolution at low - redshift relative to that at high - redshift .",
    "however , at the same time , we also see the physical effects found by @xcite  ( 1999 ) in the same simulation which encourages us to believe that we are capturing the essential features of what is happening in the real universe .",
    "we hope to examine this issue more using the upcoming higher resolution simulations .",
    "we have presented the result of the computation of the cosmic sfr and the luminosity density of galaxies using large - scale @xmath0cdm hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "the raw calculated results are significantly above the observations ( , [ fig2.ps ] , and [ fig3.ps ] ) .",
    "however , we showed that the fit with the uv - to - nearir observations of galaxy luminosity density greatly improved when the corrections of the initial input parameters and the dust extinction was applied ( , [ fig5.ps ] , and [ fig6.ps ] ) .",
    "the baryon mass - density was matched to the current best - estimate and the metallicity was corrected so that the observed intra - cluster gas metallicity was reproduced in the simulation .",
    "the resulting effects from these corrections were discussed in detail by comparing with the currently available observations including the present stellar mass - density , the local b - band galaxy luminosity density and the extragalactic background light in the optical and the fir wavelengths .",
    "our dust extinction model includes a parameter @xmath4 which characterizes the fraction of the total stellar _ luminosity _ that is heavily obscured and thus only appears in the fir - to - submm wavelengths ( the `` hidden '' sfr ) .",
    "we found that the value of @xmath5 was preferred in order to obtain a good fit with the uv - to - nearir observations of the luminosity density of galaxies .",
    "the model suggests that as much as @xmath6 of the total stellar emission is heavily obscured ( @xmath110 ) and the rest is moderately obscured ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "a large portion of the heavily obscured fraction was previously missed by the iras , and it is now starting to be resolved by the recent iso observations as explained in   [ iso ] . with the above parameters , we found that the computed optical and fir extragalactic background light from our simulation are consistent with the current observational estimates within the observational and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the computed sfr after the @xmath19 correction (   [ baryon ] ) agrees well with the extinction corrected data points ( s99 ) of the optical surveys of galaxies ( ) .",
    "our result indicates the steep rise of the sfr from @xmath1 to 1 , a moderate plateau between @xmath7 to 3 , and a gradual decrease towards high - redshift ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "we argued in   [ madauplot ] that the rapid falloff of the sfr from @xmath7 to 0 is partly due to the physical effect discovered by @xcite  ( 1999 ) : the gas in high - density regions is heated by shock - heating and supernova feedback , and the star formation in those regions is suppressed at low - redshift because the cooling time of the gas becomes longer due to the high temperature in the region .",
