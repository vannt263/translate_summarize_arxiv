    "understanding animal movement is crucial for understanding ecological and evolutionary processes in nature and has a wide range of applications such as ecosystem management , species conservation and disease control @xcite .    in the last decade",
    "it has been widely observed that the movements of many animal species , from albatrosses @xcite to spider monkeys  @xcite , honey bees @xcite to deer @xcite , and marine predators @xcite to human foragers  @xcite , appear to exhibit lvy - flight patterns , i.e. the step - size distribution can be approximated by a power - law @xmath0 with @xmath4 . despite this apparent similarity , there is an ongoing debate in the scientific community over the existence of lvy - flights in animal movement and the methodology of verifying lvy - flights from empirical data @xcite . in the meanwhile ,",
    "scientists , especially theorists , are keen on a question from a theoretical perspective : if the existence of lvy - flight in animal movement is true , why do animals perform lvy - flight ?",
    "this question fascinates researchers from various disciplines from ecology to physics @xcite .",
    "one common approach to the origin of animal movement patterns is to use the scheme of optimizing random search @xcite . in a random search model ,",
    "single or multiple individuals search a landscape to locate targets whose locations are not known _ a priori _ , which is usually adopted to describe the scenario of animals foraging for food , prey or resources .",
    "the locomotion of the individual has a certain degree of freedom which is characterised by a specific search strategy such as a type of random walk , and is also subject to other external or internal constraints , such as the environmental context of the landscape or the physical and psychological conditions of the individual .",
    "it is assumed that a strategy that optimises the search efficiency can evolve in response to these constraints , and the movement is a consequence of the optimisation on random search .    a seminal work by viswanathan _",
    "@xcite first studied lvy - flight foraging through the scheme of optimizing random search . in their model ,",
    "a forager searches for targets using a random walk with the aforementioned power - law step - size distribution .",
    "the forager will keep moving until a target is encountered , i.e. a target lies within its limited perception range .",
    "the search efficiency is defined as the encounter rate of targets , namely the number of visited targets per unit moving distance .",
    "the model considers two scenarios : ( i ) non - destructive foraging , in which the targets are revisitable , and ( ii ) destructive foraging , in which the targets are depleted once visited . for non - destructive foraging ,",
    "when the targets are sparsely distributed , there exists an optimum exponent @xmath5 that maximises the search efficiency , corresponding to the lvy - flight strategy .",
    "for destructive foraging , @xmath6 , corresponding to the ballistic motion , is the optimum solution .",
    "it is worth noting that this model only captures an idealised scenario in which learning and prey - predator relationships are ignored @xcite , and other random search strategies such as intermittent random search can outperform the lvy - flight strategy in some scenario @xcite .",
    "recent studies also turn attention to the substantial difference of the value of @xmath7 observed in empirical data .",
    "in fact the value of @xmath7 among different species can range from @xmath8 for human beings @xcite to @xmath9 for bigeye tuna @xcite .",
    "@xmath7 can also varies significantly among individuals within the same species , e.g. the value of @xmath7 can go from @xmath10 to @xmath11 in jellyfish @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that intermediate values of the optimal exponent @xmath12 can emerge in the crossover regime between non - destructive and destructive foraging in which targets are regenerated after a period @xmath13 once depleted @xcite , or arise in response to the landscape heterogeneity @xcite . a recent study by palyulin _",
    "@xcite shows that , in the case of searching for a single target in a infinite one - dimensional space , when an external drift ( underwater current , atmospheric wind and etc . )",
    "is present , @xmath7 can also vary in the interval @xmath14 .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a simple model to study lvy flight foraging in a finite two - dimensional landscape with countable targets . in our model , we consider foraging to be a step - based exploratory search process for distinct targets subject to termination .",
    "the forager can revisit the targets and the foraging efficiency is defined as the total number of discovered targets per unit moving distance in this process .",
    "we find that , different optimal search strategies can emerge in adaption to different termination conditions .",
    "in particular , when the termination is regulated by a finite number of steps @xmath1 , optimum lvy - flight strategies with various exponent @xmath7 can emerge due to the exploitation of the landscape . in this case , the value of @xmath1 , along with the landscape features such as the landscape size and the number of targets , can play an important role in determining the value of @xmath7 .",
    "when the termination is regulated by a finite moving distance @xmath15 , the best strategy is always ballistic motion corresponding to @xmath6 . to capture more complex foraging dynamics",
    ", we also consider subjective returning in our model through an exploration - return mechanism @xcite , and demonstrate that this returning can be another factor that affects the foraging efficiency .",
    "our study not only sheds new light on the the understanding of lvy - flight foraging , but also provides a new modelling framework to study animal movement patterns .",
    "the foraging takes place in a finite two - dimensional @xmath16 squared landscape with periodic boundary conditions ( when the forager moves across the boundary it will continue the movement on the opposite side of the landscape ) .",
    "there are @xmath17 targets distributed uniformly over the landscape , corresponding to a density @xmath18 .",
    "the forager can detect a target within its perception range @xmath19 .",
    "the mean free path of the system @xmath20 is therefore given by @xmath21 , which indicates the average straight - line moving distance of detecting or ` encountering ' a target in the landscape .",
    "without loss of generality we set @xmath22 , so @xmath23 . in this paper , we assume the targets are revisitable , analogous to the case of non - destructive foraging @xcite . the goal of the forager is to explore the landscape to find new targets .",
    "the foraging process is a step - based stochastic process with an exploration - return mechanism . at each step",
    "@xmath24 , the forager first decides the type of the step movement : exploration or return .",
    "let us denote the probability of choosing exploration by @xmath25 and the probability of choosing return by @xmath26 .",
    "moreover , we use @xmath27 to denote the number of distinct targets discovered by the forager up to step @xmath24 , @xmath28 to denote the accumulated moving distance since the forager leaves its last visited target , @xmath29 to denote the moving distance of step @xmath24 , and @xmath30 to denote the total moving distance up to step @xmath24 .",
    "the foraging movement at step @xmath24 is performed as follows ( illustrated in figure [ diagram ] ) :",
    "if the decision is exploration , the forager will perform random search in this step .",
    "the step - size @xmath31 and the turning angle @xmath32 are drawn randomly from the pre - defined distribution functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 . during the step movement",
    ", the forager will continuously detect targets .",
    "if a target is detected during the step movement , the forager will move to the target in a straight line and the step movement will be truncated .",
    "the actual moving distance @xmath35 in this case is smaller than the probabilisic moving distance @xmath31 and we set @xmath36 .",
    "there are two situations of detecting a target : ( a ) the target is a new target that has not been discovered before",
    ". then we update @xmath27 by @xmath37 and the location of this new target is memorised by the forager .",
    "( b ) the target is a previously visited target . in this case",
    "we do not update @xmath27 .",
    "one should note that if this step is the first step the forager leaves a target , the forager will ignore that target in detection to avoid trapping .",
    "if no target is detected in this step , we update @xmath28 by @xmath38 .",
    "2 .   if the decision is returning , the forager will move to one of the previously visited targets in a straight line .",
    "note that the forager does not attempt to detect targets in a return step , which is analogous to the ` blind ' phase in intermittent random search @xcite .",
    "we assume that the forager can memorise the locations of all previously visited targets and randomly decide on the target of the return phase . in this initial model",
    "we focus on this simple approach to modelling memory and leave more complicated memory process to future work .    here",
    "we assume that the foraging process starts at a random target in the landscape .",
    "that target can be understood as the base of the forager , and its location is recorded in the initial memory of the forager .",
    "therefore the forager can have at least one location to choose in the return phase .",
    "we use an indicator function @xmath39 to characterise the termination condition of the process .",
    "when a step is performed , we update @xmath24 by @xmath40 and check the value of @xmath41 .",
    "the process will be continued if @xmath42 , and be terminated once @xmath43 where @xmath1 denotes the total number of steps upon termination .",
    "we then define the search efficiency @xmath44 as the ratio of the total number of distinct targets discovered by the forager to the total moving distance upon termination , which yields @xmath45 one should note that , besides the subjective returning in the return phase , the forager can also revisit a previously discovered target if it lies within the forager s perception range in the exploration phase .",
    "the revisitation during exploration may occur in two scenario : ( 1 ) the forager taking advantage of the chance proximity of a previously discovered target to relieve movement constraints ( e.g. to rest or supplement energy ) prior to reinitiating exploration ; ( 2 ) the forager can detect a target within its perception range , but is not able to identify the resource availability in the detected target without a revisitation . in such context",
    ", the target can be understood to be a site that contains resource ( e.g. a tree with fruits ) .",
    "the random search dynamics in the exploration phase in our model resembles the non - destructive foraging in @xcite , while the definition of search efficiency that only accounts for distinct targets discovered by the forager resembles the case of destructive foraging with exploitation .",
    "finally , we specify the random search dynamics and the exploration - return mechanism . in this paper",
    ", we use a power - law step - size distribution for the random search , which yields @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the power - law exponent which serves as a control parameter of the random search foraging strategy .",
    "the lower bound @xmath48 represents the natural limit of step - size .",
    "the movement converges to the gaussian ( brownian motion ) when @xmath49 , and to ballistic motion when @xmath50 . for simplicity in this paper",
    "we set @xmath51 and we use a uniform distribution @xmath52 for the turning angle .    to specify @xmath25 and @xmath53 , we assume that the forager makes a decision between exploration and return according the following rule : _ the longer it has traveled since it leaves the last visited target , the more likely it will decide to return_. the decision rule here reflects the accumulated resistance on the forager s will for exploration as the moving distance increases , such as the decline of energy level , accumulated stress of finding no new targets , or other behavioural regularities . therefore @xmath25 can be represented by a non - increasing function of @xmath28 . specifically in this paper",
    "we define @xmath25 as an exponential function    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is a control parameter for tuning the intensity of such returning .",
    "a higher @xmath55 leads to a higher likelihood of subjective returning during exploration , which models more conservative foraging behaviour .",
    "similar dynamics have been observed empirically in both animals @xcite and human @xcite .",
    "the subjective returning can be used to model the home - return patterns @xcite or the central - place foraging dynamics @xcite .",
    "when @xmath56 such that @xmath57 , the model is without an return phase and the foraging dynamics resembles the non - destructive foraging in @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "the foraging in our model is tuned by five parameters , namely @xmath2 , @xmath1 , @xmath58 , @xmath17 , and @xmath55 . the power - law exponent @xmath2 characterises the random search strategy . the landscape size @xmath58 and the number of targets @xmath17 represent the environmental features .",
    "the number of steps @xmath1 regulated by the indicator function @xmath41 specifies the termination of the foraging .",
    "the intensity of subjective returning @xmath55 is an additional parameter to characterise more complex foraging dynamics .",
    "we first discuss the simple case without the subjective returning by setting @xmath56 and @xmath57 . to gain better insight into the model ,",
    "we derive a closed - form expression for the search efficiency @xmath44 using mean - field approximation .",
    "we then investigate the relationship between the optimal exponent @xmath7 and other parameters of the model using a mixture approach of numerical simulations and analytical evaluation .      to evaluate eq.([eta ] ) , we first calculate the numerator @xmath60 .",
    "we denote by @xmath61 the mean number of steps from the beginning to the discovery of the @xmath62 new target , and @xmath63 the mean number of steps between the discovery of the @xmath62 target and the @xmath64 target .",
    "intuitively , since the foraging is confined in a finite landscape with limited number of targets , as the forager explores the landscape more , the number of undiscovered targets decreases and discovering new targets becomes more difficult .",
    "if the forager detects a target at step @xmath24 , the probability that the detected target is new , denoted by @xmath65 , should be approximately proportional to the number of undiscovered targets at step @xmath24 , namely @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a constant coefficient .",
    "therefore , to discover one more new target , the forager has to make @xmath68 detections on average , which gives @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the mean number of steps between two consecutive detections .",
    "the assumption that @xmath71 indicated by eq.([dn ] ) is supported by the numerical simulation , as shown in figure [ fig4](b ) .",
    "the increment of @xmath27 at each step @xmath24 can be written as : @xmath72 the differential equation eq.([ds_eq ] ) can be solved with initial condition @xmath73 , which yields @xmath74    then we calculate the denominator @xmath75 . in mean - field approximation , @xmath75 can be simply expressed as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the mean step - size given by @xcite @xmath78 via eq.([sn ] ) and eq.([avg_l ] ) we are able to calculate the search efficiency @xmath44 .    to evaluate @xmath27 analytically through eq.([sn ] ) we still need to know @xmath70 and @xmath67 .",
    "unfortunately obtaining an exact closed - form expression for @xmath70 and @xmath67 is still a difficult mathematical issue to date .",
    "therefore we use curve fitting to obtain the value of @xmath79 in eq.([sn ] ) from simulation .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that both @xmath67 and @xmath70 remain approximately constant as @xmath24 increases .",
    "therefore we can obtain the value of @xmath80 by performing the simulation up to a small number of steps ( e.g. up to @xmath81 targets in the landscape have been discovered in our study ) , and then use the analytical solution to extrapolate the results for large @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath27 evaluated by eq.([sn ] ) with a fitting parameter @xmath80 is in good agreement with the numerical simulation , as shown in figure [ fig4](a ) . with @xmath58 and @xmath17",
    "given , to obtain a continuous curve for @xmath82 by performing numerical simulations for a small number of discrete values of @xmath2 , we can also use curve fitting to find @xmath83 and @xmath84 , as shown in figure [ fig4 ] ( c ) - ( d ) .",
    "in particular we find that @xmath83 can be well approximated by a cubic polynomial function , and @xmath84 can be well approximated by @xmath85 as suggested by @xcite where @xmath86 can be fitted by a fifth degree polynomial function .",
    "our results also suggest that , with @xmath2 given , @xmath67 depends on both @xmath58 and @xmath17 while @xmath70 only depends on @xmath20 , as shown in figure [ fig4 ] ( c ) - ( d ) .",
    "we note that both the denominator and numerator in eq.([eta ] ) , denoting the total moving distance @xmath87 and total number of discovered targets @xmath60 , respectively , are a decreasing function of @xmath2 . intuitively this is easy to understand . in an n - step truncated lvy flight ,",
    "decreasing @xmath2 not only leads to a larger mean step - size as indicated by eq.([avg_l ] ) , but also enlarges the searched area so that more new targets can be discovered by the forager .",
    "however their rates of increase with respective to the decrease of @xmath2 differ , which may lead to an optimal value for @xmath2 that maximises their ratio . in the following we",
    "study how the optimal exponent @xmath2 depends on the number of steps @xmath1 , the landscape size @xmath58 and the number of patches @xmath17 .      to study the influence of the number of steps @xmath1",
    ", we use an indictor function @xmath88 such that the foraging process is terminated at @xmath89 step for any given value of @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath90 is the kronecker delta function such that @xmath91 if @xmath92 and @xmath93 if @xmath94 .",
    "we perform numerical simulation with @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "the search efficiency @xmath44 is then fully determined by the number of foraging steps @xmath1 and the power - law exponent @xmath2 , which yields @xmath98 .",
    "we observe that for a given value of @xmath1 , there exists an optimal exponent @xmath7 which maximises @xmath44 .",
    "surprisingly we find that the value of @xmath99 shifts substantially as @xmath1 varies and is overall an increasing function of @xmath1 , as shown in figure [ fig3](a ) .    a simple explanation for the presence of such optimality relates to the increased difficulty in discovering new targets later in the foraging process , particularly for smaller @xmath2 .",
    "recall that the forager can discover new targets more rapidly in the beginning ( high - efficient stage ) but then enters into a difficult stage for discovering new targets in the latter steps ( low - efficient stage ) as the number of new targets drops .",
    "the random search with smaller @xmath2 will enter this low - efficient stage earlier in the foraging process , as shown in figure  [ fig4](a ) .",
    "the gain in @xmath60 from reducing @xmath2 will decline steadily , and will eventually no longer compensate for increases in @xmath75 ; at that point , @xmath44 reaches its maximum .",
    "the optimal exponent @xmath7 as a function of @xmath1 can be obtained by solving @xmath100 , as shown in the inset of figure [ fig3](b ) .",
    "we note that when @xmath101 the optimal exponent will approach @xmath6 approximately corresponding to ballistic motion .",
    "the optimal exponent can also approach @xmath102 for a sufficiently large @xmath1 , which means the optimal random search can go through a transition from lvy - flight ( @xmath103 ) to brownian motion ( @xmath49 ) as @xmath1 increases .",
    "we then study how the foraging efficiency depends on the landscape size @xmath58 and number of patches @xmath17 under the termination condition @xmath88 .",
    "we evaluate the search efficiency by varying the landscape size @xmath58 and the number of patches @xmath17 in three different combinations , as shown in figure [ fig8 ] : ( 1 ) varying @xmath58 and @xmath17 simultaneously with the mean free path @xmath104 kept constant ; ( 2 ) varying @xmath58 with @xmath17 kept constant ; ( 3 ) varying @xmath17 with @xmath58 kept constant .    intuitively , with @xmath1 and @xmath20 given , as @xmath17 increases , the optimal exponent @xmath7 will shift to a smaller value since the foraging can stay in the high - efficient stage for longer total moving distance , accounting for the situation in combination ( 1 ) .",
    "similarly , with @xmath1 and @xmath17 given , as @xmath20 decreases , @xmath7 will shift to a larger value , since the average distance for discovering new targets becomes shorter and the low - efficient stage comes earlier for smaller @xmath2 , accounting for the situation in combination ( 2 ) .",
    "the couple effect of increasing @xmath17 and decreasing @xmath20 is studied through combination ( 3 ) . in this case , as @xmath17 increases , @xmath7 still shifts to a smaller value , but the shifting is not as significant as the case in combination ( 1 ) .",
    "our results suggest that the foraging efficiency and the optimal foraging strategy characterised by @xmath7 can have an interesting dependence on the landscape features under specific termination condition .",
    "the foraging defined in our model is considered to be an individual search process in a finite area subject to termination .",
    "this setting can account for two scenarios in the real - world : ( 1 ) foraging within a restricted area during a certain foraging season ; ( 2 ) foraging in a fractal landscape ( where resources are clustered in patches ) such that searching each patchy area can be viewed as a single process . in scenario",
    "( 2 ) , due to the depletion of new targets , the forager has to decide on when to terminate the foraging .",
    "the indicator function @xmath41 , which characterises the termination condition and regulates the number of steps @xmath1 , can reflect the animal s prior experience , its physical conditions or behavioural regularity , or other environmental conditions such as seasonal variation that can has an influence on the forager s decision on changing foraging area . in this context , various optimal strategies may evolve in response to different termination conditions coupled with the environmental context of the foraging area .    for comparison , we study another termination condition @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the step function such that @xmath107 if @xmath108 and @xmath109 if @xmath110 . in this case , the foraging is terminated once the the accumulated moving distance @xmath28 exceeds a threshold @xmath15 , and the best strategy is always ballistic motion corresponding to @xmath6 , as shown in figure [ fig - lmax ] .",
    "the results here implies that , if the forager always prefers exploring the landscape with a prefixed length of moving distance @xmath15 ( or a certain amount of energy for exploration if we consider energy expenditure is proportional to @xmath15 ) , the optimal search strategy will evolve to ballistic motion regardless of the choice of @xmath15 . on the other hand , if the forager explores the landscape with a random moving distance @xmath75 ( or a random amount of energy ) regulated by a certain number of steps @xmath1 , various optimal search strategies from ballistic motion to lvy - flight to brownian motion can emerge depending on the landscape features .",
    "this situation is more likely to occur in scenario ( 1 ) , in which the animal may subject to daily regularity during the foraging season .",
    "for instance , the animal may only perform a regular number of foraging steps ( trips / bouts ) per day , and the moving distance in each step is randomly distributed .",
    "it is also interesting to note that , the optimality under the termination condition @xmath111 can emerge before the landscape has been fully exploited .",
    "therefore , the optimality we observe here remain valid even if we introduce an additional condition to the termination , i.e. @xmath112 , such that the foraging will be terminated once the forager discovers all targets ( or we assume that the forager has prior knowledge of the number of targets ) and will not fall into the zero - gain regime .",
    "we now turn our attention to the case with @xmath114 and briefly study this case with the simple termination condition @xmath111 .",
    "we perform numerical simulation with various intensity @xmath55 and exponent @xmath2 , as shown in figure [ fig5](a ) .",
    "as might be expected , @xmath55 has a significant impact on the search efficiency .",
    "when @xmath55 increases , the optimal exponent @xmath7 will shift to a smaller value .",
    "the result here indicates that an optimal lvy - flight search strategy can be tuned by the subjective returning which is widely observed in animals .",
    "this finding is consistent with the results in @xcite that the optimal exponent which maximises the entropy of visited locations in lvy - flight is reduced by incorporating more frequent returns in the movement .",
    "one should note that , the subjective returning here is a constraint for the random search . with @xmath2 and @xmath1",
    "given , the search efficiency @xmath44 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath55 , which indicates that a higher intensity of returning is harmful to the search efficiency .",
    "such constraint can be associated with a wide range of intrinsic physical or psychological features of the forager or external environmental context of the landscape .",
    "for example , a high value of @xmath55 can represent a harsh foraging environment that drives the forager to do more frequent subjective returnings .",
    "we also look at the two components @xmath60 and @xmath75 that gauge the search efficiency .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig5](b ) , with @xmath55 given , @xmath60 is a decreasing function of @xmath2 which aligns with the results for @xmath59 that smaller @xmath2 leading to longer steps gives rise to more discovered targets in the end .",
    "meanwhile , with @xmath2 given , @xmath60 is a decreasing function of @xmath55 .",
    "this is also intuitive since more frequent returns reduce the portion of exploration steps in the whole foraging process and the success rate of discovering new targets in each exploration step .",
    "we find that , for a given @xmath55 , @xmath115 remains a decreasing function of @xmath2 , as shown in figure [ fig7](a ) .",
    "similarly to the case with @xmath59 , the emergence of the optimal exponent for exploration - return can be also explained by considering the tradeoff between increasing @xmath60 and increasing @xmath75 .    finally , we discuss some interesting characteristics regarding @xmath115 . in the presence of subjective",
    "returning , @xmath75 is composed of two parts corresponding to two distinct phases respectively . in particular",
    "we can write @xmath116 where the superscript denotes the corresponding phase .",
    "@xmath75 can be also written as @xmath117 where the superscripted @xmath1 and @xmath77 denote the number of steps and mean step - size in each phase , and we have @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "the values of these quantities with respect to @xmath2 and @xmath55 are shown in figure [ fig6 ] and figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "we find that , for a given value of @xmath2 , @xmath77 and @xmath115 are also a increasing function of @xmath55 , which indicates high intensity of returning leads to larger mean - step size .",
    "we then find that , as expected , @xmath121 as a function of @xmath2 ( described by eq.([avg_l ] ) ) does not change with respect to @xmath55 since the characteristics in the exploration phase is not affected by @xmath55 , and with @xmath2 fixed @xmath122 is a decreasing function of @xmath55 since the portion of exploration steps decreases as @xmath55 increases .",
    "the increase of @xmath75 with respect to @xmath55 is mostly contributed by the returns since @xmath123 is much larger than @xmath121 .",
    "interestingly we find that @xmath124 , as well as the portion of return steps @xmath125 , are not a monotonic function of @xmath2 and exhibit a maximum .",
    "a possible explanation for this peak is that the value of @xmath2 determines the balance between intended return and accidental rediscovery of a known target . a lower @xmath2 results in longer steps , leading to higher likelihood of the forager deciding to return . a higher @xmath2 results in shorter steps , leading the forager to revisit the same target many times consecutively by accidentally rediscovering targets ( the trapping phenomenon in the model )",
    "following this reasoning , the peaks in @xmath124 may reflect the value of @xmath2 that maximises the aggregated return distance due to the intended and accidental returns . fully understanding these phenomena",
    "is beyond the scope of this paper and we leave it for future study .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a simple model to study lvy - flight foraging as an exploratory process subject to termination in a finite landscape with countable targets .",
    "the first important message of our results is that , the interplay between the termination of exploiting the landscape and the environmental features such as the landscape size and resource distribution , can have an significant influence on the development of optimal foraging strategy .",
    "in particular , when the number of steps ( or trips / bouts in foraging ) plays a role in the termination condition , various values of @xmath7 that captures foraging dynamics from ballistic motion to lvy - flight to brownian motion , can evolve in response to other constrained factors such as the landscape size , the number of targets as well as the intensity of subjective returning .",
    "it would be interesting for researchers to test our model in empirical data .",
    "one direct observable consequence suggested by our study is that , the value of @xmath7 may have a relationship with some dependent quantities such as the total moving distance ( energy expenditure ) or the number of steps ( trips / bouts ) of a foraging process , as well as the size or the resource distribution of the foraging area .",
    "this dependence may be tested by measuring the correlation between the value of @xmath7 and these quantities among individuals .",
    "this idealised model allows a variety of future extensions . in the current approach",
    ", we do not consider energy intake and consumption , and simply assume that the forager always has enough energy to perform long flights .",
    "one important improvement to the model is to incorporate an adaptive foraging strategy based on available energy . as a supplement to this work",
    ", one can also study other termination conditions to capture more complex internal regularity , memory mechanisms or decision - making of foraging @xcite .",
    "moreover , one can consider time - variant and heterogenous distribution of targets in the landscape , which can lead to a study of how the foraging strategy adapts to the environmental changes in the presence of cognition and memory .",
