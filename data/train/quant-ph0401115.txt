    "the phenomena of creation and evolution of vortices have always attracted people s attention both in the past and in the present . in contemporary physics",
    "they gained particular interest since having been experimentally observed in bose - einstein condensates  @xcite .",
    "vortices in superfluids , due to the absence of viscosity , exhibit certain unconventional features like the persistence of the whirl or its singular nature . the bose - einstein condensate may be described by the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( the gross - pitaevskii equation  @xcite ) satisfied by certain macroscopic wave function . in that way one has been led to studying vortices in quantum mechanics ( qm ) . there is a striking resemblance between dynamics of fluids and qm via the hydrodynamic formulation of the latter  @xcite .",
    "qm can , even in the linear version , serve as a model theory for investigating the behaviour of vortices in superfluids . such studies , concerned with the dynamical as well as topological aspects of vortex evolution in various configurations , both in nonlinear  @xcite and in linear  @xcite cases have recently been undertaken .",
    "together with the attention paid to nonrelativistic qm the singular solutions in other field theories as electromagnetism for instance have been investigated  @xcite .",
    "we will be concerned with this question also in the present paper . while considering vortices in fields corresponding to spinning particles one encounters the problem , that the wave funcion has more than one component and the condition @xmath0 , leads to too many equations which can not be simultaneously satisfied .",
    "one of the solutions of this problem for electromagnetic field was proposed in ref .  , where vortex lines were defined by the null values of two relativistic invariants : @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "these two equations mean two surfaces in the three - dimensional space .",
    "their intersection in general may be a curve  a vortex line .",
    "we will base our work on this approach .    in the present work we would like to investigate how quantum effects can influence the motion of the nodal lines of the electromagnetic wave function  @xcite .",
    "the term `` quantum '' is used here in the field theoretical sense : maxwell electrodynamics , as well as schrdinger wave mechanics , are classical from that point of view .",
    "we will concentrate on the effect of electron - positron pairs creation in electromagnetic fields . in order to construct the position and time dependent wave function",
    ", we still need the classical equations for electric and magnetic fields .",
    "these equations are no longer linear since pairs creation leads to the photon - photon interaction and maxwell equations are suplemented by additional terms which , in the lowest approximation , are cubic in fields and quadratic in the fine - structure constant ( in general they might be also nonlocal ) .",
    "although the correction is small it can certainly influence the motion of the vortex lines and particularly change their topology .",
    "one should mention here that there exists also another type of quantum effects  which remain beyond the concern of the present work  connected not with the @xmath3 content of the vacuum , but with fluctuations of the electromagnetic field itself .",
    "these effects , due to the nonzero vacuum expectation value of billinears in fields , lead to the smoothing of the vortex core ( i.e. the line on which both invariants are equal to zero ) . in this case",
    "the core is no more singular .",
    "it is defined not by the condition @xmath4 , which is not satisfied , but rather @xmath5 , where @xmath6 means @xmath7",
    "@xcite , where @xmath8 is the riemann - silberstein vector spoken more of in sections ii and iii .    as a starting point",
    "we choose the euler - heisenberg ( e - h ) lagrangian  @xcite describing , in the lowest order , the dynamics of classical electromagnetic fields with vacuum polarization effects taken into account .",
    "field equations obtained from this effective theory in section ii , exhibit solutions containing vortex lines , the evolution of which may be viewed and compared to that obtained from the classical maxwell equations . in this work",
    "we analyze two such cases .",
    "both are chosen from  @xcite to make the comparison of the results in our works very easy .",
    "our results are presented in section iii .",
    "the main practical problem in this investigation comes from the fact that quantum corrections are , in general , small and it is very hard to see them on a drawing .",
    "the choice of examples considered in our work from among those of ref .   is dictated just by the criterion of quantum effects being visible .",
    "it is clear that they are noticeable not by analyzing or measuring the precise shape of a vortex line  the slight deviation of which from that obtained in classical theory surely does occur  but rather by observing `` to be or not to be '' effects or topological ones .",
    "there are two limitations which cause some of the results of this work to be qualitative rather than quantitative .",
    "firstly they are obtained within perturbative regime .",
    "this regime means that the electromagnetic field may not be too strong and its strength is limited by the condition of @xmath9 being small .",
    "fields considered here are polynomial , so this requirement means that the evolution should not go beyond certain limited space - time region .",
    "however , close to the vortex line , similarly to the situation in gross - pitaevskii equation , the terms quadratic in @xmath10 and @xmath2 in the hamiltonian  ( [ ham ] ) become small , even for large values of electromagnetic fields , and perturbative calculation is again well justified .",
    "secondly we have to remember that that e - h lagrangian describes only slowly varying fields , for which the nonlocality may be neglected .",
    "their relative change at a distance of the compton wavelength of the electron should be small . in view of that the e - h",
    "effective lagrangian is treated in our work as a certain nonlinear model of the true theory of electromagnetic fields obtained form qed without real charges .",
    "an another interesting model in this context constitutes the born - infeld electrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "one should , however , have in mind that even small corrections , coming from weak fields can change the topology of vortices .",
    "the euler - heisenberg lagrangian  @xcite , which accounts for the vacuum polarization processes in the lowest approximation , has the following form @xmath11\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the two poincar invariants formed of electromagnetic fields @xmath14 and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are fine - structure constant and electron mass recpectively .",
    "the canonical variables are electric and magnetic inductions : @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where the former plays the role of canonical momentum and the latter of position  @xcite . in this picture",
    "the electric field strength @xmath19 in the lagrangian  ( [ lagr ] ) corresponds to velocity .",
    "the field equations , we will need for our purpose , are the canonical hamilton equations    [ caneqs ] @xmath20    where @xmath21 denotes the hamiltonian density . to find the explicit form of  ( [ caneqs ] ) we have to perform the legendre transform and pass from @xmath22 to @xmath23 .",
    "the canonical momentum is , as always , defined as a derivative of the lagrangian over velocity @xmath24 which gives @xmath25{\\bm e}({\\bm r},t)+ \\frac{28\\alpha^2}{45m^4}{\\cal p}({\\bm r},t){\\bm b}({\\bm r},t)\\ ; .\\ ] ]    this kind of equation usually bears the name of a constitutive equation .",
    "it reflects the nontrivial structure of the medium . in the present case",
    "this medium is the quantum field theory vacuum with its polarizability via electron - positron pairs creation and anihilation .",
    "we now need to invert this equation and express velocity @xmath19 in terms of canonical variables @xmath17 and @xmath18 . since our initial lagrangian  ( [ lagr ] ) is given only in one loop approximation ( @xmath26 ) then our further calculations may be led up to this order too .",
    "we can therefore postulate @xmath27 in the form @xmath28{\\bm",
    "d}({\\bm r},t)+   \\alpha^2 { \\cal m}({\\bm r},t){\\bm b}({\\bm r},t)\\ ; , \\ ] ] where quantities @xmath29 and @xmath30 are to be determined .",
    "substituting  ( [ edef ] ) into  ( [ d ] ) , neglecting terms of the order higher than @xmath26 , and comparing coefficients multiplying vectors @xmath17 and @xmath18 we find    @xmath31\\ ; , \\\\",

    "the explicit form of @xmath33 is then @xmath34-\\frac{2\\alpha^2}{45 m^4}\\left[{\\bm d}({\\bm r},t)^2-{\\bm b}({\\bm r},t)^2\\right]^2-\\frac{14\\alpha^2}{45 m^4}\\left[{\\bm d}({\\bm r},t)\\cdot{\\bm b}({\\bm r},t)\\right]^2\\ ; .\\ ] ] now we are in a position to write down the equations  ( [ caneqs ] ) in an explicit form    [ dbeqs ] @xmath35\\\\ * & & -\\frac{28\\alpha^2}{45 m^4}{\\bm d}({\\bm r},t)\\left[{\\bm d}({\\bm r},t)\\cdot{\\bm b}({\\bm r},t)\\right]\\bigg\\}\\ ; , \\nonumber\\\\ \\dot{\\bm b}({\\bm r},t)=-{\\bm \\nabla}\\times\\bigg\\{{\\bm d}({\\bm r},t)&&\\left [ 1-\\frac{8\\alpha^2}{45 m^4}\\left({\\bm d}({\\bm r},t)^2-{\\bm b}({\\bm r},t)^2\\right)\\right]\\\\ * & & -\\frac{28\\alpha^2}{45 m^4}{\\bm b}({\\bm r},t)\\left[{\\bm d}({\\bm r},t)\\cdot{\\bm b}({\\bm r},t)\\right]\\bigg\\}\\ ; , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    introducing two complex vectors @xmath36 according to the relation @xmath37 we can rewrite the equations  ( [ dbeqs ] ) in the form    [ fpm ] @xmath38\\ ; , \\label{fplus}\\\\ \\dot{\\bm f}_-({\\bm r},t)&=&i{\\bm \\nabla}\\times{\\bm f}_-({\\bm r},t)+\\frac{2 i \\alpha^2}{45 m^4}{\\bm \\nabla}\\times\\left[{\\bm",

    "this is not the case in the presence of a nonlinear medium .",
    "the evolution takes place in an empty space , without real charges , so @xmath36 have to satisfy the conditions @xmath40 by applying gradient to both sides of  ( [ fpm ] ) it can easily be seen that @xmath41 are constant in time and it is sufficient to impose the conditions  ( [ empty ] ) at time @xmath42 .",
    "in the present section we would like to show how quantum effects connected with pairs creation , influence the evolution of vortices in the electromagnetic field . from among the configurations of vortex lines considered in  @xcite",
    "we have chosen two , for which the comparison can most easily be done and the effects are clearly visible .",
    "they are the situations presented in figures 1 and 2 of  @xcite : the motion of the vortex ring and the creation and further evolution of initially linear vortex - antivortex configuration , i.e. two vortices of opposite whirl .",
    "vortex lines in quantum mechanics are usually defined by the behaviour of the wave function of the system . in hydrodynamics",
    "vortices appear in the regions of space where @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the local fluid velocity . in qm , in its hydrodynamic formulation  @xcite , the role of the fluid is played by the distrubution of probability .",
    "the velocity field , being proportional to the gradient of the phase of the wave function , can have nonvanishing curl only where this phase is singular .",
    "this in turn means the vanishing of the wave function , i.e. the simultaneous vanishing of its real and imaginary parts . in that way we are led to the conclusion that , in general , vortices have the character of the curves ( evolving in time ) costituting the intersection of two surfaces defined by the requirement @xmath0 .",
    "as it was proposed in  @xcite one can introduce in electrodynamics , in place of @xmath45 , a similar object , the vanishing of which may serve as the definition for the vortex lines .",
    "this object is @xmath46 , where @xmath47 .",
    "as argued  @xcite the quantity @xmath48 is worthy of being called a `` photon wave function '' . in the case considered in the present work ,",
    "photons move in the polarizable medium , and what is more , the nonlinear one .",
    "already in the linear ( but inhomogeneous ) medium one is forced to define the wave function as an extention of @xmath49 through the introduction of upper and lower components  @xcite defined by in  ( [ fdef ] ) @xmath50 this allows one to give the set of coupled equations the form of one , linear , schrdinger - type equation for the wave function @xmath51 . in the quantum case",
    "the linearity is inevitably lost , but the definition of vortex lines , by the requirements @xmath52 and @xmath53 , seems to be universal ( following  @xcite this kind of singular lines has recently been called `` riemann - silberstein '' vortices  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , in the full analogy with  @xcite , we choose as a basic object the quantity @xmath54 the condition @xmath55 is naturally equivalent to the choice @xmath56 .      the first configuration considered in  @xcite is defined by @xmath57    this `` wave function '' satisfies the maxwell equations and describes the evolution of a single vortex in the form of a swinging ring with varying radius .",
    "in order to see in an easy way how quantum ( nonlinear ) terms in  ( [ fpm ] ) influence this evolution , we will choose the solution @xmath58 of  ( [ fpm ] ) which is identical to  ( [ fbb1 ] ) at @xmath42 .",
    "this solution ( up to @xmath26 ) has the form @xmath59 where vector funtions @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are given by    [ abca ] @xmath63    in figure  [ fig : ring ] we show the evolution of the vortex line constituting the intersection of two surfaces @xmath64 and @xmath65 with @xmath66 defined by  ( [ sola ] ) and  ( [ abca ] ) .     to @xmath67 .",
    "the scale on the axes is such that the frame covers the region @xmath68.,width=529 ]    for simplicity both parameters @xmath69 and @xmath16 are set equal to unity on this , as well as on the following plots .",
    "the evolution extends in time from @xmath70 to @xmath67 and exhibits identical character to that of  @xcite : the swinging vortex ring , preserving its circular character , decreases to certain minimal value of radius , and then starts to increase .",
    "quantum effects do not manifest themselves in this domain of space and time . in the classical case ,",
    "hovever , the expansion of a ring will last forever , which can easily be seen from the two equations given in  @xcite    @xmath71    the former represents the sphere of a fixed center in the point @xmath72 and of constantly increasing radius ( for positive @xmath73 ) .",
    "the latter , rewritten in the form @xmath74 , tends to the motionless plane @xmath75 passing through the center of the sphere .",
    "their intersection will surely be the expanding ring .",
    "as we see in figure  [ fig : ringq ] , this ceases to be true in the quantum case .     to @xmath76",
    "the first frame is identical to the last one of figure  [ fig : ring ] , but now the scale of the axes is modified to @xmath77.,width=529 ]    due to the nonlinearity introduced by quantum effects two new phenomena appear .",
    "firstly the vortex ring starts to deviate , for intermediate times , from its regular , circular character .",
    "secondly it is no longer constantly expanding . on the contrary , after reaching certain maximal extention it starts to decrease down to its complete disappearance , if we drew also frames for larger times .    if we traced the vortex evolution even further in time ( certainly far beyond the applicability of the perturbative methods )",
    "we would observe the complicated system of vortices approaching from `` infinity '' .",
    "the second situation corresponds to the case ( b ) of  @xcite @xmath78    the above function was shown to describe the configuration of two vortices which initially are antiparallel straight lines ( we call them vortex and antivortex ) .",
    "they are born at @xmath79 and then they separate and deform .",
    "the solution of  ( [ fp ] ) which is identical to @xmath80 at @xmath42 has ( again up to @xmath26 ) the form similar to  ( [ sola ] ) @xmath81 but now with    [ abcb ] @xmath82    the evolution of this vortex configuration is presented in figure  [ fig : vav ] .",
    "again we have put @xmath83 and @xmath84 .     and @xmath85 .",
    "the units on the axes are such that each frame represents the cube @xmath68.,width=529 ]    we see in general the same motion as that found in  @xcite except one difference visible in the first frame . in",
    "@xcite the two straight , antiparallel vortices spring up at @xmath79 ( this time corresponds to the first frame ) as exactly overlapping .",
    "no vortices exist for @xmath73 between @xmath86 and @xmath69 . in the case of figure",
    "[ fig : vav ] the vortices in the first frame a slightly shifted and of different slope .",
    "this is a result of the influence of the nonlinear ( quantum ) terms in  ( [ fpm ] ) .",
    "we recall that the vectors @xmath87 and @xmath88 are synchronized for @xmath42 and not for @xmath79 .",
    "this small shift and deformation are then consequences of the quantum correction to the evolution for @xmath89 .    in  @xcite the system of vortices",
    "is born at @xmath79 , but in our case they do not overlap and consequently must have appeared earlier .",
    "it is therefore interesting to take a step back in time and see how these vortices arise in the quantum case .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : vavq ] .    .",
    "the frames correspond to times just before @xmath79 . now",
    "the scale on the @xmath90 axis is changed to make the splitting of vortices easily visible : @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    ", width=529 ]    figure  [ fig : vavq ] brings to light the essential change : the two independent vortices in the classical case , or rather vortex and antivortex , become the two fractions of the same , tightly bent , vortex line , when quantum corrections are taken into account .",
    "their sudden creation turns out now to be a motion during which this single vortex line simply enters into the observation region and is being deformed .",
    "one might expect this kind of effects  that could be called topological effects  together with the smoothing of the evolution , to be the most typical ones introduced by the nonlinearity of the quantum equations . to make the effect more visible we present it again on figure  [ fig : vavqext ] , now seen from another viewpoint .",
    "seen now from the viewpoint other than that of figure  [ fig : vavq ] and with @xmath90-axis rescaled even more.,width=529 ]    we would like also to emphasize that the above phenomena take place for electromagnetic fields weak enough to remain in full agreement with the use of perturbation theory .",
    "yet another difference , however not visible on figures  [ fig : vavq ] and  [ fig : vavqext ] , is the slight deviation of the system of vortex lines from their planar character . in the clasical case the vortex lines arose as the intersection of a plane with a certain surface , and",
    "therefore all vortices have to lie forever in one plane .",
    "this is no longer true in the quantum case .",
    "in the present paper we analyzed the influence of the nonlinear , quantum terms in the maxwell equations on the evolution of vortex lines . by making the comparison with the results obtained earlier in the classical case  @xcite we found that this evolution may be changed in a visible and essential way . in the first considered configuration of the constantly expanding vortex ring ,",
    "our calculations show that quantum corrections may lead to deformation and to disappearance of this ring . in the second case of two linear and antiparallel vortices of the infinite size , which are suddenly created ,",
    "we show how the process of this `` creation '' looks like , and that the two independent vortices ( in the classical case ) turn out to be just different fractions of the same vortex curve .",
    "this kind of topological changes might be expected as a result of nonlinearity introduced by vacuum polarization .",
    "the present analysis has certain limitations which come both from its perturbative character and from the `` low frequency '' approximation which allowed one to derive the e - h lagrangian .",
    "it can , however , serve as a qualitative picture of what type of phenomena may be introduced by the quantum effects .",
    "one is still very far from constructing the nonperturbative solutions of quantum electrodynamics , which would be deprived of the above limitations , and therefore it might be also interesting to consider the evolution of nodial lines in certain exact nonlinear theory as born - infeld electrodynamics .",
    "however , in this case , one can not expect to find the polynomial solutions as given by  ( [ sola],[solb ] ) and only numerical calculations come into play .",
    "this situation is similar to that in the nonlinear quantum mechanics .    at the end",
    "we would like to note that although the observed deformation and evolution of vortices have their roots in the quantum nature of the vacuum , similar structures may also appear in classical and linear fields by the appropriate perturbation of the vortex configurations .",
    "both the deviation of a vortex ring from the planar character as well as the occurrence of a ` hairpin'-shaped vortex , similar to that of figure  [ fig : vavqext ] , are known in optical difraction  @xcite .",
