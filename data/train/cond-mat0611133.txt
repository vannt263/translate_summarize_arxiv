    "application of this theory to the dn/@xmath0-wave superconductor ( dn / d ) junctions has shown that the formation of mars strongly competes with the proximity effect in dn@xcite .",
    "it was also demonstrated that the formation of mars coexists with the proximity effect in dn/@xmath2-wave superconductor ( dn / p ) junctions , which produces a giant zero bias conductance peak ( zbcp)p - wave .",
    "recently this theory has been extended to diffusive josephson junctions with unconventional superconductors@xcite .",
    "it is clarified that a nonmonotonic temperature dependence of the critical current appears in d / dn / d junctions due to the competition between the proximity effect and the formation of mars .",

    "moreover detailed derivation of the boundary conditions is not given and only d / dn / d junctions are considered in ref.@xcite .",
    "since proximity effect and mars strongly influence the density of states@xcite , they should also crucially influence josephson effect in diffusive unconventional superconducting junctions .",

    "then , solving the usadel equations , we apply the general approach to study the influence of the exchange field , the proximity effect and the formation of mars on josephson current simultaneously .",
    "a number of peculiarities in the josephson current are found depending on the pairing symmetry : a nonmonotonic temperature dependence in d / dn / d junctions , anomalous current - phase relation in p / dn / p junctions , second harmonics in the current - phase relation and their half - periodic oscillations as a function of the length of df in d / dn / d and p / dn / p junctions , transitions to a @xmath4 state in d / df / d , p / df / p and s / df / p junctions , a double peak structure in the temperature dependence of the critical current in d / df / d junctions , and enhancement of josephson current by the exchange field in s / df / p junctions .",
