    "<S> target mass corrections to the twist-4 terms @xmath0 as well as to the leading - twist @xmath1 are discussed .    </S>",

    "<S> +    we know that different approaches [ 1 - 7 ] have been employed to study higher - twist effect to the nucleon structure functions . there were also several phenomenological analyses of the nucleon structure functions to study quark - hadron duality and to extract the higher - twist contributions ( like the ones of the twist-3 and twist-4 terms ) from experimental measurements [ 8 - 11 ] . </S>",
    "<S> those analyses are going to be more and more accurate since the more and more precise measurements of the nucleon spin structure functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 are becoming available [ 11 - 12 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the high precision data have been employed to study the validity of the quark - hadron duality for the nucleon structure function @xmath4 [ 13 ] and even for spin asymmetry @xmath5 by hermes [ 14 ] recently . </S>",
    "<S> several experiments to test the higher - twist effect on the nucleon spin structure functions are being carried out in the jefferson laboratory [ 9,15 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been pointed out , in the literature , that the target mass corrections ( tmcs ) should be considered in the studies of the nucleon structure functions [ 16 ] in a moderate @xmath6 region , and of the bloom - gilman quark - hadron duality [ 17 - 18 ] . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , only after the important target mass corrections are removed from the experimental data , one can reasonably extract the higher - twist effect [ 18 ] . </S>",
    "<S> there were several papers about the target mass corrections to @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the past [ 19 ] . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the target mass corrections to the nucleon structure functions for the polarized deep - inelastic scattering have been systematically studied [ 20 - 21 ] . in our previous work </S>",
    "<S> [ 22 ] , tmcs to the twist-3 matrix element in the nucleon structure functions are addressed . in this report </S>",
    "<S> , tmcs to the twist-4 terms @xmath0 as well as to the leading - twist @xmath1 will be discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> consider the cornwall - norton ( cn ) moments @xmath9 , we know that the first cn moment of @xmath2 can be generally expanded in inverse powers of @xmath6 in operator production expansion ( ope ) [ 1 - 2 ] as @xmath10 with the coefficients @xmath11 relating to the nucleon matrix elements of operators of twist @xmath12 . in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) , the leading - twist ( twist-2 ) component @xmath13 is determined by the matrix elements of the axial vector operator @xmath14 , summed over various quark flavors . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficient of @xmath15 term , @xmath16 , contains the contributions from the twist-2 @xmath1 , twist-3 @xmath17 , and twist-4 @xmath18 , respectively . usually , @xmath17 is extracted from the third moments of the measured @xmath19 and @xmath20 by using @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is pointed out that this method for @xmath17 ignores the target mass corrections to the third moments of @xmath22 , and the target mass corrections play a sizeable role to @xmath17 [ 22 ] in a moderate @xmath6 region .    to further estimate tmcs to the twist-4 of the nucleon spin structure functions </S>",
    "<S> , one may assume that the contributions from higher - twist term with @xmath23 can be ignored [ 23 ] or assume this term to be a constant ( neglecting any possible @xmath6-dependence ) [ 8 ] . </S>",
    "<S> based on the first assumption , we have @xmath24 when no tmcs are considered , @xmath1 and @xmath17 can be simply expressed by the cn moments of the nucleon spin structure functions , and we get @xmath25    when tmcs are considered , we have to employ the nachtmann moments @xmath26g_1(x , q^2)-y^2x^2\\frac{4n}{n+2}g_2(x , q^2)\\bigg \\ } ,   \\nonumber \\\\ </S>",
    "<S> m^{(n)}_2(q^2)&=&\\int^1_0dx\\frac{\\xi^{n+1}}{x^2 } \\bigg \\{\\frac{x}{\\xi}g_1(x , q^2 ) + \\big [ \\frac{n}{n-1}\\frac{x^2}{\\xi^2}- \\frac{n}{n+1}y^2x^2\\big ] g_2(x , q^2)\\bigg \\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the nachtmann variable @xmath27 ( with @xmath28 ) , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the bjorken variable . </S>",
    "<S> the two nachtmann moments are simultaneously constructed by the two spin structure functions @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath8 are replaced by the ones with tmcs ( see refs . [ </S>",
    "<S> 20 - 22 ] ) , one can easily expand the two nachtmann moments with respect to @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the results are @xmath32 , and @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the two expressions explicitly tell that , different from the cn moments , one can get the contributions of a pure twist-2 with spin - n and a pure twist-3 with spin-(n-1 ) operators from the nachtmann moments . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of the nachtmann moments means that they contain only dynamical higher - twist , which are the ones related to the correlations among the partons . as a result , they are constructed to protect the moments of the nucleon spin structure functions from the target mass corrections . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , to extract the higher - twist effect , say twist-3 or twist-4 contribution , one is required to consider the nachtmann moments instead of the cn moments .    </S>",
    "<S> we use the nachtmann moments to express @xmath34 and @xmath35 and obtain @xmath36\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , tmcs to the twist-4 contribution , due to the two different moments , is @xmath37 . here </S>",
    "<S> , we employ the parametrization forms of the spin structure functions of the proton , neutron and deuteron [ 11 - 12 ] to estimate @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the well - known wandzura and wilczek ( ww ) relation [ 24 ] @xmath39 is valid if only the leading - twist is considered , and tmcs to the twist-2 contribution do not break the ww relation . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the higher - twist operators , like twist-3 and twist-4 , are considered , the ww relation @xmath40 no longer preserves . </S>",
    "<S> thus , one may write @xmath41 [ 8,9 ] , where @xmath42 represents the violation of the ww relation . the non - vanishing value of @xmath42 just results from the higher - twist effect .    </S>",
    "<S> one can calculate @xmath38 with the parametrizations of @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the results are plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the typical values of the differences are in order of @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> there are several theoretical estimated values for the twist-4 term @xmath18 in the literature ( see table 1 ) , like the ones of the bag model [ 4 ] , of the qcd sum rule [ 5,6 ] , of the empirical analyses of the experimental measurements [ 8 , 23 ] , and of the instanton model [ 25 ] . comparing the estimated differences in fig . 1 to those estimated values displayed in table 1 , </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that tmcs to the twist-4 term @xmath18 are negligible ( less than 2% ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that @xmath38 of the proton and deuteron are always larger than that of the neutron .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we check tmcs to the leading twist term ( with spin-3 ) @xmath1 . if no tmcs are considered , @xmath44 . when tmcs are taken into account , we get , from the nachtmann moments , @xmath45g_1(x , q^2 ) -\\frac{12}{5}y^2x^2g_2(x , q^2)\\bigg \\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] fig </S>",
    "<S> . 2 displays the @xmath6-dependence of the ratio @xmath46 for the proton , neutron and deuteron targets . </S>",
    "<S> the sizable effect of tmcs is clearly seen , since the ratios all diverge from unity obviously . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath47 , the effect of tmcs is still about 10% for the proton and deuteron targets . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the effect on the proton and deuteron targets is much larger than that on the neutron . here </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath6-dependences of the three ratios are similar to those of the twist-3 terms [ 22 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the sizeable effect tells that tmcs should be taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , to estimate the matrix element of @xmath1 , the nachtmann moments are required to be employed .     </S>",

    "<S> it is reiterated that in order to precisely and consistently extract the contributions of the leading - twist @xmath1 , of the twist-3 @xmath17 and of the twist-4 @xmath18 with a definite spin and with a moderate @xmath6 value , one is required to employ the nachtmann moments @xmath48 instead of the cn moments . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that tmcs play an evidently role to @xmath1 when @xmath6 is small . </S>",
    "<S> the above conclusion does not change if different parameterizations of the structure functions are employed . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that tmcs to the twist-4 term is much smaller than those to the twist-3 term and to the leading - twist term </S>",
    "<S> .    finally , the expressions of the differences @xmath38 and @xmath49 between the cn and nachtmann moments are @xmath50 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\big [ 87g_2^{(5 ) } -258y^2g_2^{(7)}+798y^4g_2^{(9)}\\big ] \\bigg \\}+{\\cal o}(y^8),\\nonumber \\\\ </S>",

    "<S> one sees that the two expressions mainly depend on the higher - moment of the nucleon spin structure functions , and therefore , on the spin structure function in the large - x region . in the most of the empirical analyses of the ellis - jaffe sum rule ( the first moment of @xmath2 ) , </S>",
    "<S> the contribution from the spin structure function in the large - x region is assumed to be trivial , since it behaves like @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> when the higher - moment of the spin structure function is considered , the effect of the spin structure functions in the large - x region becomes important . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the measurement of the nucleon spin structure functions in the large - x region with a high precision is required . </S>"
