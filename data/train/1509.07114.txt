    "many studies have been performed on lsm like o(4 ) lsm @xcite at vanishing temperature , o(4 ) lsm at finite temperature @xcite and @xmath7 lsm for @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 quark flavors @xcite . in order to obtain reliable results , extended lsm to plsm ] can be utilized , in which information about the confining glue sector of the theory is included in form of polyakov - loop potential .",

    "furthermore , the quasi - particle model ( qpm ) @xcite was suggested to reproduce the lattice qcd calculations @xcite , in which two types of actions are implemented ; the lattice qcd simulations utilizing the standard wilson action and the ones with renormalization - improved action .    in the present work ,",
    "we integrate the gluonic sector of qpm to lsm @xcite ( qlsm ) in order to reproduce the recent lattice qcd calculations @xcite . in qlsm @xcite ,",
    "the polyakov contributions to the gluonic interactions and to the confinement - deconfinement phase transition are entirely excluded .",
    "instead we just add the gluonic part of qpm .",
    "therefore , the quark masses should be very heavy .",
    "we shall comment on this , later on . in section [ sec : results ] , we outline the qlsm results .",
    "they are similar to that of pnjl .",
    "this might be interpreted due the very heavy quark masses implemented in both models .",
    "similar approach has been introduced in @xcite .",
    "the authors described in inclusion of gluonic polyakov loop , which is assumed to generate a large gauge invariance and lead to a remarkable modification in hadron thermodynamics .",
    "a quite remarkable bridging between pnjl model quantum and local polyakov loop and hrg model has been introduced @xcite .",
    "a large suppression of the thermal effects has been reported and it was concluded that the center symmetry breaking becomes exponentially small with increasing the massed of constituent quarks . in other words ,",

    "the hrg grand canonical ensemble includes two important features @xcite ; the kinetic energies and the summation over all degrees of freedom and energies of the resonances . on other hand",
    ", it is known that the formation of resonances can only be achieved through strong interactions  @xcite ; _ resonances ( fireballs ) are composed of further resonances ( fireballs ) , which in turn consist of resonances ( fireballs ) and so on_. in other words , the contributions of the hadron resonances to the partition function are the same as that of free ( non - interacting ) particles with an effective mass . at temperatures comparable to the resonance half - width , the effective mass approaches the physical one @xcite .",
    "thus , at high temperatures , the strong interactions are conjectured to be taken into consideration through the inclusion of heavy resonances .",
    "it is found that the hadron resonances with masses up to @xmath11gev are representing suitable constituents for the partition function  @xcite .",
    "such a way , the singularity expected at the hagedorn temperature  @xcite can be avoided and the strong interactions are assumed to be taken into consideration .",
