    "we begin by giving a simple argument which shows how the information metric arises in a classical probabilistic setting from the concept of information .",
    "suppose that alice has two coins ,  @xmath15 and  @xmath16 , characterized by the probability distributions  @xmath17 and  @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "suppose that she chooses coin  @xmath15 , tosses it  @xmath19 times , and then sends the data to bob , without disclosing to him which coin she chose .",
    "if bob knows  @xmath4 and  @xmath5 , how much information does the data provide him about which coin was tossed ? intuitively , the more information the data provides , the more sharply the distributions are distinguished .    using bayes theorem and stirling s approximation for the case where  @xmath19 is large , on the assumption that coins  @xmath15 and  @xmath16 are _ a priori _ equally likely to be chosen , one finds that @xmath20 where  @xmath21 is the probability that the tossed coin is  @xmath15 given the data , and likewise for  @xmath22  . when the probability distributions are close , so that  @xmath23 , the argument of the exponent can be expanded in the  @xmath24 to give @xmath25 where  @xmath26 is the information metric .",
    "now , the information gained by bob ,  @xmath27 , is the reduction in his uncertainty , and is therefore defined as @xmath28 with  @xmath29 being an entropy  ( uncertainty ) function such as the shannon entropy .",
    "but , since  @xmath30 and  @xmath31 is determined by  @xmath32 , once  @xmath29 is selected ,  @xmath27 is determined by  @xmath32 .",
    "for example , if  @xmath29 is chosen to be the shannon entropy  @xmath33 , one finds that @xmath34 this result immediately generalizes to the case where  @xmath4 and  @xmath5 are @xmath35-dimensional probability distributions  ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "hence , from an informational viewpoint , it is natural to endow the space of discrete probability distributions with the information metric .",
    "parenthetically , we remark that wootters statistical distance ,  @xmath2 , between the probability distributions  @xmath4 and  @xmath5 is the minimum distance between  @xmath4 and  @xmath5 with respect to the information metric  . in terms of these coordinates ,",
    "the information metric becomes euclidean ,  @xmath37 , and the probability simplex becomes the positive orthant of the unit hypersphere in the @xmath38-space .",
    "the minimum distance between the vectors  @xmath39 and  @xmath40 is then simply  @xmath41 which is  @xmath42 . ] .",
    "we do not , however , make use of this result in what follows .",
    "measurement is idealized as a process that ( i )  when performed upon some physical system , yields one of  @xmath7 possible _ outcomes , _ with probabilities ,  @xmath43 , that are determined by the state of the system immediately prior to the measurement , and ( ii )  is reproducible , so that , upon immediate repetition of the measurement , the same outcome is obtained with certainty .",
    "we take the first feature , complementarity , to consist of the general idea that , when a measurement is performed upon a system in some state , the measurement outcome only yields information about _",
    "half _ of the experimentally - accessible degrees of freedom of the state . in the above classical probabilistic model of measurement",
    ", we can express this idea in a very simple way as follows :    * _ postulate 1 .",
    "_ * complementarity*. when measurement  @xmath6 is performed , one of @xmath44  possible _ events _ occur , but they are not individually observed .",
    "outcome  @xmath45 is observed  ( @xmath46 ) whenever either event  @xmath47 or event  @xmath48 is realized .",
    "the events  @xmath49 are assumed to occur with probabilities  @xmath50 , respectively , so that @xmath51 where  @xmath52 is the probability of outcome  @xmath45 .",
    "the  @xmath53  ( @xmath54 ) can be summarized by the probability @xmath19-tuple  @xmath55 . as a result , of the  @xmath56 degrees of freedom of  @xmath57",
    ", the measurement outcome only yields information about the  @xmath52 , which constitute  @xmath58 degrees of freedom .",
    "we shall shortly impose an additional constraint  ( global gauge invariance ) which implies that only  @xmath59 of the  @xmath56 degrees of freedom of  @xmath57 are physically relevant .",
    "hence , the measurement yields information about exactly one half of the experimentally - accessible degrees of freedom in  @xmath57 .",
    "intuitively , performing the measurement brings about the realization of one of  @xmath44 possible events but the observed outcomes _ coarse - grain _ over these events :  when event  @xmath47 or  @xmath48 occurs , the measurement is  ( for some reason to be investigated ) unable to resolve the individual events , so that only outcome  @xmath45 is registered .",
    "this is a novel hypothesis , which , at this point in the derivation , is recommended by its simplicity , and remains to be judged by its explanatory power  ( namely its capacity to support a derivation of the quantum formalism )  .",
    "next , we endow the space of probability distributions  @xmath57 with the information metric ,  @xmath60 , where  @xmath54 .",
    "it is convenient to define  @xmath61 , where  @xmath62 $ ] , since the metric over the  @xmath63 is then simply the euclidean metric ,  @xmath64 , so that  @xmath65 is a unit vector that lies on the positive orthant of the unit hypersphere  @xmath66 is a @xmath44-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "we now consider transformations of state space which represent physical transformations of the system .",
    "we postulate that transformations of the state space , assumed one - to - one , preserve the metric over state space  that is , the _ information distance _ ,  @xmath67 , between any pair of infinitesimally close states ,  @xmath68 , where  @xmath69 denotes distance with respect to the metric over state space , is preserved .",
    "the essential idea here is that the discriminability of any pair of nearby states is a quantity that is intrinsic to this pair of states , and is therefore should remain invariant under reversible and deterministic transformations of the system  , this postulate can be grounded in the idea that the information distance between any pair of nearby states should be the same irrespective of the measurement from whose perspective the states are observed . ] .",
    "now , if one takes the  @xmath70 themselves as the state space of the system , one immediately finds that continuous one - to - one transformations of the state space that preserve the information metric are not possible .",
    "a simple way to allow the existence of such transformations is to take the entire unit hypersphere ,  @xmath71 , as the state space of the system .",
    "that is , we take the state of the system as been given by a unit vector  @xmath65 , with  @xmath72 $ ] , where the probabilities  @xmath53 are given by  @xmath73 . from the information metric over the  @xmath57",
    ", it follows from the relation  @xmath73 that the metric over the  @xmath70 is euclidean , @xmath74 we can summarize the above requirements as follows :    * _ postulate 2 .",
    "_ * metric invariance . * the state of the system is given by the unit vector  @xmath65 , with  @xmath72 $ ] , where the probabilities  @xmath53 are given by  @xmath73 .",
    "the metric over the  @xmath70 is euclidean ,  @xmath75 , which any transformation ,  @xmath76 , of state space must preserve .",
    "it follows from this postulate that  @xmath70 lies on the unit hypersphere ,  @xmath66 , in a @xmath44-dimensional real euclidean space . from the requirement of metric preservation",
    ", it follows that  @xmath76  is an orthogonal transformation of  @xmath66 , so that every transformation can be expressed as  @xmath77 , where  @xmath78 is a  @xmath44-dimensional real orthogonal matrix .",
    "the above extension of the state space from the positive orthant of  @xmath66 to the entire hypersphere is an assumption which , although formally rather natural , presently awaits a clear physical basis .      the second feature , _ global gauge invariance _ , consists of the idea that one can find a representation of the state of a system such that",
    ", if one displaces a subset of the degrees of freedom of the state by the same amount , any physical predictions based on the state are left invariant . to formalize this feature , we begin by making a change of variables by expressing the state ,  @xmath70 , in terms of the probabilities  @xmath79 , and @xmath7  additional real degrees of freedom ,  @xmath80 , so that , without loss of generality , @xmath81 only the  @xmath82 can be subject to displacement since a displacement involving any of the  @xmath52 would be experimentally detectable .",
    "accordingly , we formalize the idea of global gauge invariance by requiring that  @xmath83 , where  @xmath84 is an unknown , non - constant , differentiable function to be determined , and that the transformation  @xmath85 for  @xmath46 brings about no predictive changes for any  @xmath86 . from this global gauge condition , we immediately draw the following postulate :    * _ postulate 3 .",
    "_ * gauge invariance . *",
    "the map  @xmath76 is such that , for any state  @xmath87 , the probabilities ,  @xmath88 , of the outcomes of measurement  @xmath6 performed upon a system in state  @xmath89 are unaffected if , in any representation ,  @xmath90 , of the state  @xmath70 , an arbitrary real constant ,  @xmath91 , is added to each of the  @xmath92 .    additionally , we draw the the requirement that the measure ,  @xmath93 , over  @xmath94 induced by the metric over  @xmath66 is consistent with the global gauge condition . this requirement is necessary in order that probabilistic inference using the measure as a prior over state space is consistent with our physical knowledge of the system .",
    "this requirement yields the following postulate :    * _ postulate 4 .",
    "_ * measure invariance . *",
    "the measure  @xmath93 induced by the metric over state space satisfies the condition  @xmath95 for any  @xmath91 .      from eqs .  ,  , and  , @xmath96 the measure ,  @xmath97 , over  @xmath98 induced by this metric is proportional to the square - root of the determinant of the metric , and marginalizes to give @xmath99 as the measure over  @xmath92 , where  @xmath100 is a constant .",
    "now , from the measure invariance postulate , it follows by marginalization that the measure  @xmath101 satisfies the relation  @xmath102 for all  @xmath91 , and is therefore independent of  @xmath92 .",
    "hence , from eq .  ,",
    "@xmath103 , where  @xmath104 are constants , where  @xmath105 since , by assumption , the function  @xmath84 is not constant",
    ". we can therefore write @xmath106      from eq .  , the gauge invariance postulate , and the relation  @xmath107 given above , one can show that  @xmath78 is restricted to one of two _ types _ :  @xmath78  has the general form @xmath108{4 }                  \\\\",
    "t^{(n1 ) } &   t^{(n2 ) } & \\dots &           t^{(nn ) } \\end{pmatrix},\\ ] ] where  @xmath109 has the form @xmath110 and where either  @xmath111  ( type  1 ) , in which case  @xmath109 is a scale - rotation matrix , or  @xmath112  ( type  2 ) , in which case  @xmath109 is a scale - rotation - reflection matrix , with scale factor  @xmath113 and rotation angle  @xmath114 in either case  .    now",
    ", the state  @xmath70 can be faithfully represented by the complex unit vector @xmath115 and , remarkably , one can then show that every transformation  @xmath78 of type  1 corresponds one - to - one with the set of unitary transformations of  @xmath9 , and that every transformation  @xmath78 of type  2 corresponds one - to - one with the set of antiunitary transformations of  @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , on the assumption that a parameterized transformation that represents a continuous physical transformation must reduce to the identity for some value of the parameters , it follows that a continuous transformation must be represented by unitary transformations .      the third feature , _ measurement simulability _ , can be stated as follows :    * _ postulate 5 .",
    "_ * measurement simulability . * any reproducible measurement ,  @xmath116 , describable in the formalism can , insofar as its outcome probabilities and associated output states are concerned , be simulated by an arrangement consisting of measurement  @xmath6 flanked by suitable interactions with the system .",
    "given the results derived above , this postulate immediately implies that  @xmath116 can be simulated by the arrangement shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : representation - of - measurement ] , where  @xmath117 and  @xmath118 are unitary transformations representing the interactions with the system .",
    "the reproducibility of measurement  @xmath6 implies that the state of a system immediately after  @xmath6 has yielded outcome  @xmath45 is given by  @xmath119 , where  @xmath120 is undetermined .",
    "hence , the input state  @xmath121 will yield outcome  @xmath45 . in order that the arrangement behave like a reproducible measurement",
    ", the output state must be  @xmath122 up to an overall phase , so that it suffices to choose  @xmath123 for  @xmath46 , which implies that  @xmath124 .",
    "simulation of measurement  @xmath116 in terms of measurement  @xmath6.,width=312 ]    since the  @xmath125 form an orthonormal basis , it follows from  @xmath121 that the  @xmath126 also form an orthonormal basis .",
    "therefore , any state  @xmath9 can be expanded as  @xmath127 , where  @xmath128 . with the input state  @xmath9 ,",
    "the state measured by measurement  @xmath6 in the arrangement is  @xmath129 . from eq .",
    ", the probabilities ,  @xmath43 , of the outcomes of measurement  @xmath6 performed on state  @xmath130 are given by  @xmath131 .",
    "therefore , in this case , the measurement yields outcome  @xmath45 , together with output state  @xmath122 , with probability  @xmath132 , which is the born rule .",
    "the physical irrelevance of the overall phase of a pure state is usually regarded as being a minor mathematical feature of the quantum formalism of little physical importance . from this standpoint ,",
    "one of the most surprising finding in the derivation is that the global gauge condition  ( which expresses in a more general way the physical irrelevance of the overall phase ) is sufficiently strong as to transform a @xmath44-dimensional real formalism  ( where states are real unit vectors , and the transformations are the orthogonal transformations ) into the familiar @xmath7-dimensional complex vector formalism of quantum theory  ( where states are complex unit vectors , and the transformations are the unitary and antiunitary transformations ) . in particular , the fact that the set of possible transformations one obtains is _ precisely _ the set of all unitary and antiunitary transformations  ( and neither more nor less ) is not something that could , _ a priori _ , have been reasonably anticipated .",
    "the derivation provides a number of other important insights into the structure of the quantum formalism . from the perspective of the derivation ,",
    "it is clear that the use of complex numbers in the quantum formalism is directly tied to the set of possible transformations of state space .",
    "for example , if the set of _ all _ orthogonal transformations were allowed , then the complex form of the formalism , whilst still possible to write down , would involve non - linear continuous transformations and would therefore not appear mathematically natural .",
    "the derivation also suggests that information geometry is directly or indirectly responsible for many of its key mathematical features  ( such as the importance of square - roots of probability , and the sinusoidal functions that appear in a quantum state ) , thereby providing significant new support for the hypothesis that information plays a fundamental role in determining the structure of quantum theory .",
    "finally , the derivation illuminates a previous partial reconstruction of quantum theory due to stueckelberg  @xcite .",
    "stueckelberg makes an assumption similar to the complementarity postulate to arrive at the idea that the state of a system is given by a @xmath44-dimensional probability distribution which can be written as a unit vector in a @xmath44-dimensional ` square - root of probability space ' , as we have done .",
    "he then asserts that the allowable transformations of the state space are orthogonal transformations , and shows that , if the transformations are restricted by a superselection rule , then the set of restricted transformations is equivalent to the set of unitary transformations acting on a suitably - defined @xmath7-dimensional complex state space .",
    "the present derivation shows that stueckelberg s assertion that the allowable transformations are orthogonal transformations can be naturally accounted for in terms of the information metric over the probability simplex via the metric invariance postulate .",
    "the derivation also shows that stueckelberg s superselection rule can be replaced by the global gauge invariance postulate .",

    "<S> in this paper , we show how information geometry , the natural geometry of discrete probability distributions , can be used to derive the quantum formalism . </S>",
    "<S> the derivation rests upon three elementary features of quantum phenomena , namely complementarity , measurement simulability , and global gauge invariance . </S>",
    "<S> when these features are appropriately formalized within an information geometric framework , and combined with a novel information - theoretic principle , the central features of the finite - dimensional quantum formalism can be reconstructed .    </S>",
    "<S> the unparalleled empirical success of quantum theory strongly suggests that it accurately captures fundamental aspects of the workings of the physical world . </S>",
    "<S> the clear articulation of these aspects is of inestimable value not only for the deeper understanding of quantum theory in itself  @xcite , but for its modification  ( for example , to allow non - unitary continuous transformations  @xcite ) and its further development , particularly for the development of a theory of quantum gravity  ( see  @xcite , for example ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , such articulation has traditionally been hampered by the fact that the quantum formalism , in which these aspects are presumably encoded , consists of postulates expressed in an abstract mathematical language to which our physical intuition can not directly relate . over the last two decades </S>",
    "<S> , there has been growing interest in elucidating these aspects by expressing , in a less abstract mathematical language , what quantum theory _ might _ be telling us about how nature works , and trying to derive , or _ reconstruct _ , quantum theory on this basis  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> much of the recent effort in reconstructing the quantum formalism is motivated by the hypothesis that the concept of information might be the key , hitherto missing , ingredient , that may enable a reconstruction , and several attempts have been made to systematically explore the reconstruction of the quantum formalism from an informational starting point  ( for example  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> although these approaches have yielded significant insights , they are either incomplete  ( for example ,  @xcite ) or employ abstract assumptions that involve the assumption of the complex number field  ( for example ,  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> such assumptions significantly limit the degree to which the physical content of the quantum formalism can be elucidated since one of the most mysterious mathematical features of the quantum formalism is being assumed at the outset . in this paper , we show that the principal mathematical features of quantum theory can be reconstructed using the concept of information without employing such assumptions .    </S>",
    "<S> our approach develops intimate connections , known to exist for some time , between structures that arise naturally in classical probability theory on the one hand , and the quantum formalism for pure states on the other  @xcite . for example , wootters  @xcite has shown in the framework of classical probability theory that one can quantify the degree to which two discrete probability distributions ,  @xmath0 and  @xmath1 , can be distinguished given the same number of samples from each by means of the _ statistical distance _ ,  @xmath2 , between them . </S>",

    "<S> the existence of such a connection is remarkable , and suggest that the usual formalism of quantum theory might owe at least some of its structure to the notion of distinguishability that arises naturally in a purely classical probabilistic setting .    </S>",
    "<S> following wootters , we adopt an operational approach , and so take the probabilistic nature of measurements as a given . accordingly </S>",
    "<S> the framework of classical probability theory is taken as a starting point . </S>",
    "<S> we equip this framework with a metric ,  @xmath12 , the _ information metric _  ( or fisher - rao metric ) , the infinitesimal form of the statistical distance , rather than the statistical distance itself , as this suffices for the purposes of the reconstruction . </S>",
    "<S> this metric determines the distance between infinitesimally close probability distributions  @xmath13 and  @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> as we shall describe below , the information metric can be understood as a natural consequence of the introduction of the concept of information into the probabilistic framework . </S>",

    "<S> within this framework , we formalize three elementary features of quantum phenomena , namely complementarity , global gauge invariance , and measurement simulability , detailed below . </S>",
    "<S> these features can be understood as assertions about the physical world quite apart from the setting of the quantum formalism within which they are usually encountered  @xcite , and are sufficiently simple to be taken as primitives in the building up of quantum theory . to these features , we add an information - theoretic principle , the principle of metric invariance . from these ingredients , we reconstruct the principal features of the finite - dimensional quantum formalism , namely that pure states are represented by complex vectors , physical transformations are represented by unitary or antiunitary transformations , and the outcome probabilities  ( and the corresponding output states ) of measurements are given by the born rule . </S>",
