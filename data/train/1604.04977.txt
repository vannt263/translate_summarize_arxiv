    "a surface - plasmon - polariton ( spp ) is a coupled state between electromagnetic ( em ) field and electron plasma oscillations at the interface between a metal and a dielectric , for which the em field could be confined in subwavelength dimensions normal to the surface of metal .",
    "consequently , metallic cavities supporting spp modes have been used to realize spp lasers ( also known as plasmonic lasers or spasers ) with subwavelength dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the energy in a spaser can remain confined as coherent spps or it can be made to leak out from the spaser as radiation . in many targeted applications in integrated optics and nanophotonics , spasers are developed as nanoscale sources of coherent electromagnetic ( em ) radiation and show interesting properties such as ultrafast dynamics for applications in high - speed optical communications .",
    "parallel - plate metallic cavities supporting spp modes are also utilized for terahertz quantum - cascade lasers ( qcls )  @xcite to achieve low - threshold and high - temperature performance  @xcite owing to the low - loss of spp modes at terahertz frequencies that are much smaller than the plasma frequency in metal .",
    "the most common type of plasmonic lasers with long - range spps , which include terahertz qcls , utilize fabry - prot  type cavities in which at least one dimension is longer than the wavelength inside the dielectric  @xcite .",
    "one of the most important challenges for such plasmonic lasers is their poor coupling to free - space radiation modes owing to the subwavelength mode confinement in the cavity , which leads to small radiative efficiency and highly divergent radiation patterns .",
    "this problem is also severe for terahertz qcls based on metallic cavities and leads to low - output power and undesirable omnidirectional radiation patterns from fabry - prot  cavities  @xcite .",
    "a possible solution to achieve directionality of far - field emission from spasers is to utilize periodic structures with broad - area emission , which has been used for both short - wavelength spasers  @xcite as well as terahertz qcls  @xcite . on chip phased - locked arrays  @xcite or metasurface reflectors composed of multiple cavities  @xcite",
    "have also been utilized for directional emission in terahertz qcls . however , edge - emitting fabry - prot  cavity structures with narrow cavity widths are more desirable , especially for electrically pumped spasers to achieve small operating electrical power and better heat removal from the cavity ( along the width of the cavity in lateral dimension , through the substrate ) for continuous - wave ( cw ) operation . in this paper , we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate a new technique for implementing distributed - feedback ( dfb ) in plasmonic lasers with fabry - prot  cavities , which is termed as an _ antenna - feedback _ scheme .",
    "this dfb scheme has no resemblance to the the multitude of dfb methods that have been conventionally utilized for semiconductor lasers .",
    "the key concept is to couple the guided spp mode in a spaser s cavity to a single - sided spp mode that can exist in its surrounding medium by periodic perturbation of the metallic cladding in the cavity .",
    "such a coupling is possible by choosing a bragg grating of appropriate periodicity in the metallic film .",
    "this leads to excitation of coherent single - sided spps on the metallic cladding of the spaser , which couple to a narrow - beam in the far - field .",
    "the narrow beam emission is due in part to the cavity acting like an end - fire phased - array antenna at the microwave frequencies , as well as due to the large spatial extent of a coherent single - sided spp mode that is generated on the metal film as a result of the feedback scheme .",
    "experimentally , the antenna - feedback method is implemented for terahertz qcls for which the method is shown to be an improvement over the recently developed third - order dfb scheme for producing directional beams  @xcite since it does not require any specific design considerations for phase - matching  @xcite .",
    "the emitted beam is more directional and the output power is also increased due to increased radiative field by virtue of this specific scheme .",
    "single - mode operation in spasers with fabry - prot  cavities could be implemented in a straightforward manner by periodically perturbing the metallic film that supports the resonant spp modes .",
    "the schematic in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) shows an example of a periodic grating in the top metal cladding for a parallel - plate metallic cavity that could be utilized to implement conventional @xmath1-th order dfb by choosing the appropriate periodicity .",
    "since the spp mode has maximum amplitude at the interface of metal and dielectric active medium , a periodic perturbation in the metal film could provide strong bragg diffraction up to high - orders for the counter - propagating spp waves inside the active medium with incident and diffracted wavevectors @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively , such that @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the grating period , @xmath6 is the grating wavevector , and @xmath1 is an integer ( @xmath7 ) that specifies the diffraction order . for plane - wave like modes at frequencies far away from the plasma resonance in metal , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the free - space wavelength corresponding to the spp mode and @xmath10 is the effective propagation index in active medium ( approximately the same as refractive index of the medium ) , the so - called bragg mode with @xmath11 is resonantly excited because it is , by design , the lowest - loss mode in the dfb cavity within the gain spectrum of the active medium . for terahertz qcls with metallic cavities , first - order  @xcite and second - order  @xcite dfbs have been implemented to achieve robust single - mode operation .",
    "however , these conventional dfb techniques do not achieve directionality of far - field radiation in both directions .",
    "there is phase mismatch for spp waves on either side of metal claddings and destructive interference between successive apertures , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) for propagating spp waves .",
    "therefore , no coherent single - sided spp waves can be established on the metallic cladding in the surrounding medium as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) .",
    "consequently , 2d photonic - crystal dfb structures have been utilized for broad - area ( surface ) single - mode emission  @xcite for which diffraction - limited beams could be achieved at the expense of large cavity dimensions .",
    "in contrast to conventional dfb methods in which periodic gratings couple forward and backward propagating waves inside the active medium itself , the antenna - feedback scheme couples a single - sided spp wave that travels in the surrounding medium with the spp wave traveling inside the active medium as illustrated in fig .  [ fig1](d ) .",
    "the spp wave inside the active medium with incident wavevector @xmath8 is diffracted in the opposite direction in the surrounding medium with wavevector @xmath12 .",
    "for the first - order diffraction grating ( @xmath13 ) , equation   results in @xmath14 that leads to excitation of a dfb mode with @xmath15 , which is different from any of the @xmath1-th order dfb modes that occur at @xmath11 .",
    "hence , the antenna - feedback mode could always be excited by just selecting the appropriate grating period @xmath5 such that the wavelength occurs close to the peak - gain wavelength in the active - medium . for gaas / algaas based terahertz qcls , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and hence for a chosen grating - period @xmath5",
    ", the first - order dfb , antenna - feedback , and second - order dfb modes occur at wavelengths @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 respectively .",
    "the typical gain - bandwidth of terahertz qcls is less than @xmath21 of the peak - gain wavelength , which suggests that the grating has to be designed specifically to excite the antenna - feedback mode .",
    "the antenna - feedback scheme leads to excitation of a coherent single - sided spp standing - wave on the metallic cladding of the spaser , which is phase - locked to the resonant - cavity spp mode inside the active medium as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](f ) .. both waves maintain exact same phase relation at each aperture location , where they exchange electromagnetic ( em ) energy with each other due to diffraction as illustrated in fig .  [ fig1](e ) .",
    "the spp wave in the surrounding medium is excited due to scattering of em field at apertures that generates a combination of propagating quasi - cylindrical waves and spps  @xcite that propagate along the surface of the metal - film .",
    "the scattered waves thus generated at each aperture superimpose constructively in only the end - fire ( @xmath22 ) direction owing to the phase - condition thus established at each aperture .",
    "for coupling to far - field radiation , the radiation is therefore analogous to that from an end - fire phased array antenna that produces a narrow beam in both @xmath23 and @xmath24 directions .",
    "thick and based on a @xmath25 gaas/@xmath26  qcl design ( details in supplementary material , section  s1 ) .",

    "the qcls are biased at a current - density @xmath30 at @xmath31 .",
    ", width=316 ]    a third - order dfb technique was recently shown to achieve emission in a narrow beam for terahertz qcls with fabry - prot  cavities  @xcite .",
    "it can achieve high directionality for the radiated beam in both directions perpendicular to propagation , so long as the effective propagation index of the spp wave inside the active medium could be made @xmath32 by complex deep dry etching in the slits  @xcite or lateral corrugated geometry  @xcite .",
    "the so - called phase matching condition is possible for gaas - based qcls by cavity engineering  @xcite since the @xmath33 is close to @xmath34 .",
    "the antenna - feedback technique in this work offers similar outcome as a perfectly matched third - order dfb with improved directionality as well as a novel outcoupling mechanism of the radiated beam from terahertz qcls .",
    "it is to be noted that the antenna - feedback scheme is automatically phase - matched and hence it could be utilized for any type of spaser without any restrictions on the required index in the active medium .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows comparison of the eigenmode spectrum of a terahertz qcl cavity with conventional dfb , taking third - order dfb as an example versus antenna - feedback gratings computed using a finite - element solver  @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of band - gaps in the spectra is indicative of the dfb effect . in both cases ,",
    "the lower - frequency band - edge mode is the lowest - loss mode by way of dfb action , since the dfb modes result in a standing - wave being established along the length of the cavity with an envelope shape that vanishes close to the longitudinal boundaries ( end - facets ) . for antenna - feedback grating ,",
    "a standing - wave for the single - sided spp wave is additionally established in air , as can be seen from the field - plot of the band - edge mode in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) .",
    "in contrast , third - order dfb leads to negligible amplitude of the single - sided spp wave in air , as mentioned previously and illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) . for the dominant tm polarized ( ey ) electric field of antenna - feedback ,",
    "the hybrid spps mode bound to the top metal layer consists of both quasi - cylindrical waves and spps , which are evanescent - field with a free - space propagation constant .",
    "particularly at long wavelengths , such as mid infrared and thz region , spps and quasi - cylindrical waves complexly mix with each other  @xcite , contributing to the large spatial extent of spp mode in surrounding medium as shown in fig .  [ fig2](b ) , which does not exist for any conventional dfb , such as first - order , second - order and third - order dfb .",
    "in addition , hybrid spps on top of metallic grating and standing - wave inside laser cavity show clearly different periodicity , with the ratio of free space wavelength over guided wavelength , which further confirms that the excitation of the coherent spp wave on both side of top metallic surface contribute to feedback and coupling mechanism with antenna - feedback scheme .",
    "the absorbing boundaries at the longitudinal ends of the cavity  @xcite increase the relative loss of the modes that are further away from the band - edge mode , which helps in mode discrimination and will lead to excitation of the desired band - edge mode for single - mode operation of the spaser .",
    "the active region and metal layers are modeled as lossless since the exact loss contribution due to each is not clear in literature for terahertz qcls at cryogenic temperatures . if lossy metal is used , the relative loss of various resonant modes for the dfb cavities are not impacted and neither are the mode - shapes and the corresponding resonant frequencies . for the band - edge modes in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) and fig .  [ fig2](b ) , a loss of @xmath35 was estimated as a contribution from the absorbing boundaries .",
    "consequently , the radiative ( outcoupling ) loss of of the third - order dfb is @xmath36 as compared to @xmath37 for the antenna - feedback .",
    "the radiative loss of the third - order dfb is smaller since the band - edge mode has zeros of the radiative field ( @xmath38 ) being located at each aperture , since the grating period @xmath5 is integer multiple of half - wavelengths in the gaas / algaas active medium ( @xmath39 , where @xmath40 ) .",
    "such a low - outcoupling efficiency is also existent in surface - emitting terahertz qcls with second - order dfb  @xcite . for the cavity with antenna - feedback ,",
    "the radiative loss is higher because the grating period is not an integer multiple of half - wavelengths inside the active medium ( @xmath41 ) that leads to large amplitudes of the radiative - field ( @xmath38 ) in alternating apertures as shown in the figure . as a consequence ,",
    "the output power from terahertz qcls with antenna - feedback should be greater than that with conventional dfb gratings , which is an additional advantage of the antenna - feedback scheme for terahertz qcls .",
    "this was also verified experimentally from the measured output power .",
    "the recently developed second - order dfb qcls with graded periodicity  @xcite achieve high - power emission for the same reason ,  non - zero radiative field under the metallic apertures .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows experimental results from terahertz qcls implemented with antenna - feedback gratings .",
    "details about fabrication and measurement methods are presented in supplementary material ( section  s1 ) .",
    "[ fig3](b ) shows representative @xmath42-@xmath43  curves versus heat - sink temperature for a qcl with @xmath44 .",
    "the qcl operated up to a temperature of @xmath45 . in comparison , multi - mode fabry - prot  cavity qcls on the same chip that did not include longitudinal or lateral absorbing boundaries operated up to @xmath46 .",
    "light - current characteristics and spectra at different bias with fabry - prot  cavity are shown in supplementary material ( section  s3 ) .",
    "the temperature degradation due to absorbing boundaries is relatively small and similar to previous reports of dfb terahertz qcls  @xcite .",
    "the inset shows measured spectra at different bias at @xmath31 .",
    "most qcls tested with different grating periods showed robust single - mode operation except close to peak - bias when a second - mode was excited for some devices at a shorter - wavelength , which suggests it is likely due to a higher - order lateral mode being excited due to spatial - hole burning in the cavity .",
    "peak - power output of @xmath47 was detected from the antenna - feedback qcl measured directly at the detector without using any collecting optics . for comparison ,",
    "a terahertz qcl with third - order dfb ( without phase matching ) and similar dimensions was also fabricated on the same chip , which operated up to a similar temperature of @xmath48 and emitted peak - power output of @xmath49 ( see supplementary material , section  s3 ) .",
    "the antenna - feedback gratings lead to greater radiative outcoupling compared to conventional dfb schemes for terahertz qcls , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "[ fig3](c ) shows spectra measured from four different terahertz qcls with antenna - feedback gratings of different grating periods @xmath5 .",
    "the single - mode spectra scales linearly with @xmath5 , which is the clearest proof that the feedback mechanism works as expected and the lower band - edge mode is selectively excited in each case . using @xmath50 from equation  , the effective propagation index of the spp mode in the active medium @xmath10 is calculated as @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 for qcls with @xmath5 of @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 respectively .",
    "the effective mode - index @xmath10 decreases because a larger @xmath5 introduces larger sized apertures in the metal film since the grating duty - cycle was kept same for all devices .",
    "consequently , a greater amount of field couples to the single - sided spp mode in air for increasing @xmath5 , thereby reducing the modal confinement in the active medium that reduces the propagation index of the guided spp mode further .     in pulsed mode and biased at @xmath30 while lasing in single - mode .",
    "the plots are for qcls with @xmath59 mm long cavities and ( b )  @xmath60 width and @xmath61 grating emitting at @xmath62 , ( c )  @xmath63 width and @xmath61 grating emitting at @xmath62 , and ( d )  @xmath63 width and @xmath44 grating emitting at @xmath64 respectively .",
    ", width=316 ]    experimental far - field beam patterns for antenna - feedback qcls with varying designed parameters are shown in fig .",
    "single - lobed beams in both lateral ( @xmath23 ) and vertical ( @xmath24 ) directions were measured for all qcls . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) , the full - width half - maximum ( fwhm ) for the qcl with @xmath60 width , @xmath61 is @xmath65 , which is the narrowest reported beam - profile from any terahertz qcl to - date .",
    "in contrast , previous schemes for emission in a narrow - beam have resulted in divergence angles of @xmath66 using very long ( @xmath67 ) cavities and a phased - matched third - order dfb scheme  @xcite and @xmath68 using broad - area devices with 2d photonic - crystals  @xcite for single - mode terahertz qcls , and @xmath69  @xcite and @xmath70  @xcite for multi - mode qcls using metamaterial collimators .",
    "[ fig4](c ) and [ fig4](d ) show representative beam patterns from qcls with wider cavities of @xmath63 width , for the smallest and largest @xmath5 in the range of fabricated devices respectively .",
    "the beam divergence is relatively independent of @xmath5 as expected .",
    "more importantly , the measurements show that the wider cavities result in a slightly broader beam .",
    "such a result is counter - intuitive because typically a laser emits in a narrower beam as its cavity s dimensions are increased due to an increase in the size of emitting aperture .",
    "such a behavior is unique for a spaser with antenna - feedback , and is discussed along with full - wave 3d fem simulation of the beam pattern in supplementary material ( section  s2 ) .",
    "it can be argued that the size of the beam could be further narrowed by utilizing narrower cavities for terahertz qcls , which will be extremely beneficial to develop cw sources of narrow - beam coherent terahertz radiation .",
    "in this article , we have presented a novel antenna - feedback scheme to achieve single - mode operation and a highly directional far - field radiation pattern from plasmonic lasers with subwavelength apertures and fabry - prot  type cavities .",
    "it is conceptually different from any other previously utilized dfb schemes for solid - state lasers , and is based on phase - locking of a single - sided surface - plasmon - polariton ( spp ) mode on ( one of ) the metal film(s ) in the spaser s cavity with the guided spp mode inside the spaser s active medium .",
    "the phase - locking is established due to strong bragg diffraction of the spp modes by periodically perforating the metal film in the form of a grating of holes or slits .",
    "the uniqueness of the method lies in the specific value of the grating s period , which leads to the spaser s cavity radiating like an end - fire phased - array antenna for the excited dfb mode .",
    "additionally , coherent single - sided spps are also generated on the metal film that have a large spatial extent in the surrounding medium of the laser s cavity , which could have important implications for applications in integrated plasmonics .",
    "coherent spps with large spatial extent could make it easy to couple spp waves from the plasmonic lasers to other photonic components , and could also potentially be utilized for plasmonic sensing .",
    "experimentally , the scheme is implemented in terahertz qcls with subwavelength metallic cavities .",
    "a beam - divergence angle as small as @xmath0 is achieved for single - mode qcls , which is narrower than that achieved with any other previously reported schemes for terahertz qcls with periodic photonic structures .",
    "compared with the third - order dfb method , the new antenna - feedback scheme is easier to implement for fabrication by standard lithography techniques without any other complex fabrication technique to precisely match a well defined effective mode index , and achieves a superior radiative outcoupling owing to the fact that the grating period is not an integer multiple of half - wavelengths of the standing spp - wave inside the active medium .",
    "terahertz qcls with antenna - feedback could lead to development of new modalities for terahertz spectroscopic sensing and wavelength tunability due to access of a coherent terahertz spp wave on top of the qcl s cavity , possibilities of sensing and imaging at standoff distances of few tens of meters , and development of integrated terahertz laser arrays with a broad spectral coverage for applications in terahertz absorption spectroscopy .",
