    "electron spins confined in carbon nanotube@xcite ( cnt ) quantum dots@xcite ( qd ) are considered attractive for quantum information storage and processing due to the absence of the hyperfine interaction@xcite which is the main source of decoherence in iii - v nanostructures .",
    "the spin - orbit ( so ) coupling that is intrinsically present in cnts due to s - p hybridization accompanying the curvature of the graphene plane @xcite paves the way for electrical control of the confined carrier spins . in particular",
    "the so interaction allows for spin flips induced by ac electric fields @xcite according to the mechanism of the electric - dipole spin resonance as studied earlier for iii - v quantum dots.@xcite    in nanotube quantum dots the so coupling splits the four - fold degeneracy of energy levels with respect to the spin and valley into kramers doublets with spin - orbit coupling energy varying from a fraction of mev @xcite to several mev .",
    "@xcite in this work we study the states confined in a qd defined electrostatically within the cnt and simulate spin and valley transitions driven by ac electric field between the quadruple of nearly degenerate energy levels in external magnetic field .    for clean cnts the coupling between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 valleys is absent which motivates ideas to use the valley degree of freedom as a carrier of the quantum information alternative for the electron spin .",
    "in the transport experiments the valley filters and valves were proposed @xcite for clean samples in which the inter - valley scattering can be neglected . for clean cnt double quantum dots",
    "the phenomenon of valley blockade has been demonstrated in experiment @xcite and studied theoretically @xcite as the equivalent of the pauli spin blockade .",
    "@xcite a theory for rabi inter - valley resonance for cnt has also been presented @xcite within a continuum approximation of the tight - binding hamiltonian .    in this work",
    "we report on time - dependent tight - binding simulations for the spin - valley transitions driven by ac field . in the present model the electron confinement within the dot , the lattice disorder , and",
    "the spin - valley dynamics are monitored at the atomic scale .",
    "we work with a direct solution of the time dependent schrdinger equation which allows us to resolve not only the rabi oscillations corresponding to the first order transition but also the fractional resonances in higher - order transitions observed in edsr experiments on iii - v @xcite as well as cnt @xcite qds .",
    "we discuss the effects driving the spin - flips with a particular focus on the electric field component that is perpendicular to the axis of the cnt , and which is bound to appear in experimental setups with cnts deposited or suspended above the gates.@xcite we show that a very similar dynamics of transitions is obtained for a bent cnt .",
    "the bend of the nanotube for electric dipole spin resonance in nanotubes was previously proposed@xcite but in the context of the electron motion along the bend in the external magnetic field and the resulting variation of the effective zeeman splitting . in the present system",
    "the motion of the electron is limited to the qd area and has a secondary effect on the transitions , still the bend of the nanotube in external _ electric _ field lowers the symmetry of the eigenstates which allows for the spin flips .",
    "we discuss the consequences of the perpendicular electric field , disorder and the bend of the cnt for selection rules and transition times .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "in summary , we presented simulations of the spin flip and inter - valley transitions in a quantum dot defined within a semiconducting carbon nanotube .",
    "we considered a single excess electron in the quantum dot and evaluated the dynamics of the spin and valley transitions driven by external ac electric field .",
    "time - dependent calculations used the basis of localized eigenstates as determined by the tight - binding approach .    for a straight and clean cnt",
    "the spin - flips are forbidden even for strong so coupling .",
    "the spin transitions are triggered by electric field perpendicular to the axis of the cnt .",
    "we demonstrated that the spin - flip transition times are inversely proportional to the value of the perpendicular electric field component .",
    "we demonstrated that the bend of the cnt in external electric field allows for the spin - flips due to lifting of the selection rules by lowering the angular symmetry of the eigenstates with the spin - flip transition times scaling linearly with @xmath2 .",
    "we demonstrated that when so coupling is present the atomic disorder alone allows for all types of transitions including spin flips .",
    "we discussed the disorder introduced by a vacancy which  even when far from the qd  perturbs the angular symmetry of the eigenstates lifting the selection rules prohibiting the inter - valley transitions .",
    "the inter - valley transitions when allowed by the lattice disorder appear roughly 100 to 1000 times faster than the spin flips and are insensitive to the electric fields perpendicular to the axis of the cnt .",
