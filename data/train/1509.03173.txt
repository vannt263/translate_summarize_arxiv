    "last years the alice collaboration studied production of @xmath0 mesons mostly in central @xmath6pb@xmath6pb collisions ( see e.g. @xcite ) at @xmath7 = 2.76 tev i.e. at the highest available nucleus - nucleus center - of - mass energies . at these high energies",
    "different theoretical mechanisms come into game ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "for instance in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors emphasized thermal aspect of charmonia production . in order to describe detailed distributions in transverse momentum , rapidity or multiplicity",
    "several dynamical mechanisms have to be taken into account .",
    "in contrast to early expectations @xcite there are mechanisms which lead to both suppression and regeneration of @xmath0 quarkonia in cold and hot medium .",
    "experimental studies discuss usually so - called nuclear modification factor as a function of multiplicity , transverse momentum and rapidity of @xmath0 and smooth dependences have been observed ( a nice summary was presented e.g. in @xcite ) .    in last years",
    "there was also an interest in calculating cross sections for exclusive production of @xmath0 mesons in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the main reason for these investigations was a better understanding of interaction of a small size ( @xmath2 ) perturbative dipole with a nucleus or more explicitly with the nuclear gluons incorporated in different ways in different models .",
    "in general , this may be related to gluon saturation phenomenon which in the case of nucleus may be more efficient than for the case of nucleon due to a coherent action of many nucleons ( larger gluon occupation ) .",
    "all the previous investigations were related to purely ultraperipheral collisions ( upc ) , i.e. when the nuclei stay intact . in theoretical calculations",
    "upc means in practice @xmath8 ( sum of nuclear radii ) .",
    "all the calculations must be therefore performed in the impact parameter space to include this condition .",
    "can the photoproduction process ( photon emission , its fluctuation into @xmath2 and subsequent rescattering of the dipole ( or hadron ) in the nucleus ) be active also for less peripheral collisions i.e. when nuclei collide and break apart producing , at these high energies , quark - gluon plasma ? a recent analysis of the alice collaboration @xcite",
    "presents differential studies of inclusive production of @xmath0 in pb - pb collisions exclusively at forward rapidities . at low transverse momenta and small multiplicity",
    "they observe an enhancement of @xmath9 1 . according to our knowledge",
    "this enhancement was not explained so far in the literature .",
    "we wish to address this issue in the following paper .",
    "we will try to discuss the issue in the equivalent photon approximation ( epa ) . in the present first estimate of the cross section",
    "we will discuss several approximations how to calculate relevant photon fluxes to include approximately the physical conditions relevant in the photoproduction of @xmath0 .",
    "this is very important for the peripheral and semi - central collisions . for simplicity in the following we will use a simple vector dominance model ( vdm ) combined with multiple scattering of the hadronic photon fluctuation for calculating the @xmath10 cross section which , as will be shown in this paper , describes relatively well the cross section for production of @xmath0 mesons in upcs .    a very recent analysis of the alice collaboration @xcite confirms the presence of the enhancement at very small @xmath0 transverse momentum and tries to extract the new not fully understood contribution for different centrality bins .",
    "we shall try to describe the alice preliminary data @xcite assuming the mentioned above photoproduction mechanism .",
    "nuclear photoproduction of a single vector meson @xmath11 can be understood as a photon fluctuation into hadronic ( virtual @xmath11 meson or quark - antiquark pair ) component and its subsequent propagation through the second ( cold ) nucleus and a transformation ( fragmentation ) into the on - shell @xmath11 meson .",
    "[ fig : photoproduction_single ] illustrates a mechanism of a single vector meson production in ultraperipheral ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions . the cross section for this mechanism",
    "is usually written differentially in the impact parameter @xmath12 and in the vector meson rapidity  @xmath13 @xmath14 above @xmath15 or @xmath16 is the probability density for producing a vector meson @xmath11 at rapidity @xmath13 for fixed impact parameter @xmath12 of the heavy - ion collision .",
    "probability density expresses two - different possibilities of the production of vector meson shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : photoproduction_single ] .",
    "each of the probabilities is the convolution of the cross section for @xmath17 or @xmath18 ( the photon emitted from first or second nucleus ( @xmath19 ) ) and a corresponding flux of equivalent photons : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is usually a function of impact parameter between heavy ions ( @xmath12 ) and not of photon - nucleus impact parameter .",
    "finally @xmath22 is an impact parameter dependent survival factor which with good precision can be approximated as @xmath23 .",
    "now we wish to proceed to semi - central collisions i.e. to the case of @xmath4 .",
    "then the survival factor has to be omitted as we are interested also in situations when colliding nuclei break apart . in the present approach",
    "we will modify only photon fluxes and leave the coherent @xmath24 cross section unmodified .",
    "this seems a crude approximation which should be reasonable only for rather peripheral collisions @xmath25 .",
    "we shall try to see how far this approximation can be extrapolated down to smaller @xmath12 .",
    "the effective photon flux which includes the geometrical aspects can be formally expressed through the real photon flux of one of the nuclei and effective strength for the interaction of the photon with the second nucleus @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "the extra @xmath28 factor ensures collision when the photon hits the nucleus - medium . for the photon flux in the second nucleus one needs to replace 1@xmath292 ( and 2@xmath291 ) . for large @xmath30 : @xmath31 . for small impact parameters",
    "this approximation is , however , not sufficient .",
    "this has some consequences also for ultraperipheral collisions , which will be discussed somewhat later in this section .",
    "since it is not completely clear what happens in the region of overlapping nuclear densities we suggest another approximation which may be considered rather as lower limit . in this approximation",
    "we integrate the photon flux of the first ( emitter ) nucleus only over this part of the second ( medium ) nucleus which does not collide with the nucleus - emitter ( some extra absorption may be expected in the tube of overlapping nuclei ) .",
    "this may decrease the cross section for more central collisions .",
    "in particular , for the impact parameter @xmath32 the resulting vector meson production cross section will fully disappear by the construction . in the above approximation the photon flux can be written as : @xmath33 we shall use the three different approximations how to calculate photon fluxes and three different form factors which are main ingredients of the photon flux . we shall start with @xmath34 corresponding to point - like charge . in this approximation",
    "the flux of the photons is given by the simple formula @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the nuclear charge , @xmath37 is energy of the photon , @xmath38 is a distance in the impact parameter space between the photon and the emitting nucleus , @xmath39 is a modified bessel function and @xmath40 .",
    "the photon flux integrated over all @xmath38 is approximately equal to the photon flux in the region of @xmath41 .",
    "this can be calculated analytically : @xmath42 \\right ) \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath43 .    in our calculations we use also",
    "a form factor which is fourier transform of the charge distribution in nucleus .",
    "two - parameter fermi distribution ( called equivalently woods - saxon distribution ) @xmath44 where the normalization constant @xmath45 for the lead nuclei equals to @xmath46 @xmath47 and @xmath48 fm , @xmath49 fm is used in the calculation . the form factor ( called here realistic form factor for brevity )",
    "is calculated then as @xmath50 in the literature often a monopole form factor is used @xmath51 which simplifies the calculations .",
    "the value of @xmath52 can be expressed through the root mean square electric radius @xmath53 giving @xmath54 mev for @xmath55 fm for @xmath6pb .",
    "in our calculation we use the following generic formula for calculating the photon flux ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) for any nuclear form factor @xmath56 we shall compare the cross sections for the @xmath0 photoproduction using the point - like , monopole and realistic form factors ( see table [ table : cross_sections_jpsi ] ) . but",

    "the time picture of the whole process is not clear to us in the moment .",
    "the rather reasonable agreement of our quite simplified approach with the preliminary alice data could suggest that the `` coherent '' ( assumed by the formula used for the @xmath24 process ) scattering of the hadronic fluctuation happens before the nucleus undergoes the process of deterioration due to nucleus - nucleus collision and before the quark - gluon plasma is created .",
