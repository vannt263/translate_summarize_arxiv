    "during recent years , ordered b2 ferh ( cscl structure ) has received increased attention due to its extraordinary properties , in particular its temperature - driven isostructural transition between a ferromagnetic ( fm ) and antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase at @xmath1{k}$ ] , which was discovered more than seven decades ago  @xcite",
    ". this transition is accompanied by a large volume change of @xmath2% and a complete loss of the rh moment in the af phase ( 1.0@xmath3 in fm ) , while the fe moment remains large and essentially constant around 3.2 - 3.3@xmath3 across the transition .",
    "the availability of a metamagnetic transition near room temperature ( rt ) makes ferh an interesting material for a number of technological applications like heat assisted magnetic recording ( hamr)@xcite , antiferromagnetic spintronics@xcite and magnetic refrigeration  @xcite . for a recent review on this topic see ref .  .",
    "hamr is believed to be the future magnetic recording technology in order to extend the areal density to and beyond  @xcite . near field transducers ( nfc )",
    "are used to focus laser light well below the diffraction limit to give a thermal write assist , enabling the use of highly anisotropic recording media like fept  @xcite . due to the high curie temperature of fept ,",
    "thermally written - in - errors due to highly excited states in combination with low saturation magnetization , as well as the limited lifetime of nfcs remain an issue for this technology  @xcite .",
    "an interesting idea to overcome those problems is to replace the second order transition of fept by the first order transition of ferh .",
    "thiele et al .  proposed an exchange spring structure for the recording process by coupling ferh to fept  @xcite .",
    "the advantage is that the first order phase transition of ferh can be tailored well below the curie temperature of fept , which relaxes the lifetime and reliability problem of the nfcs .",
    "furthermore during recording the magnetic moment of ferh is still high overcoming the problem of thermally written - in - errors @xcite .",
    "another exciting application of ferh is in the developing field of spintronics , which is promising significant advantages in data storage  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the af to fm transition in ferh can be driven by electric fields , leading to electric on and off switching of ferromagnetism near rt  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to fm memory and storage devices , application based on af spintronics are insensitive to magnetic field pertubation and generate no magnetic stray fields , thus eliminating crosstalk .",
    "these advantages come at the price of an increased difficulty in manipulating the antiferromagnetic aligned magnetic moments  @xcite . a room temperature ferh af memory resistor was recently demonstrated by marti and coworkers , using the fm phase to pre -",
    "align the magnetic moments of the af phase after cooling , and using the anisotropic magnetoresistance ( amr ) to read out data  @xcite .",
    "soon after , sequential write - read operations on ferh af memory were performed using joule heating to trigger the metamagnetic transition  @xcite .",
    "employing mssbauer spectroscopy , bordel et al .",
    "reported a strain - driven fe - spin reorientation across the af - to - fm transition in epitaxially strained ferh thin films grown on mgo , which could be of significant use in af spintronics applications  @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that ferh can be used as a material for spin wave transmission  @xcite .",
    "recently , also the giant magnetocaloric effect ( mce ) of b2 ferh shifted back into the scientific focus , since ferh has one of the highest adiabatic temperature changes of all known materials ,  @xcite which in addition is accompanied by large elasto- and barocaloric effects  @xcite .",
    "however , the transition suffers from a large hysteresis and a high sensitivity to stoichiometry and anti - site defects.@xcite nonetheless , liu et al .",
    "reported a large reversible caloric effect in a dual - stimulus magnetic - electric refrigeration cycle for a ferh film grown epitaxially on batio@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the origin of the metamagnetic transition has been under vibrant debate for more than half a century .",
    "an early explanation was given using the exchange inversion model by kittel , where the exchange parameters vary linearly with the lattice parameter and change their sign at some critical value , thus causing the transition  @xcite .",
    "however , this model is incompatible with the large entropy change observed at the transition  @xcite .",
    "later , reasoned by the large differences in low temperature specific heats between the af and fm phases , tu et al.@xcite argued that a change in entropy of band electrons is solely responsible for the transition , but this view fails to explain the transition in the case of admixture of 5% ir to ferh , where the relation of the specific heats becomes reversed  @xcite .    in 2003 ,",
    "part of the present authors proposed an explanation for the transition based on the competition between af fe - fe and fm fe - rh exchange interactions .",
    "monte carlo simulations of a blume - capel spin model suggested that longitudinal thermal fluctuations of the rh magnetic moments in the fm phase give rise to a schottky anomaly far below @xmath5 , which finally provides the entropic stabilization of the fm phase.@xcite coupling the magnetic subsystem to lattice and volume degrees of freedom leads to a very good agreement with experiment in terms of the entropy change @xmath6 at @xmath5 and the temperature dependence of the gibbs free energy difference @xmath7 .",
    "recent state - of - the - art measurements of the specific heat @xmath8 in ferh thin films with af and fm magnetic order seem to support the presence of this schottky anomaly.@xcite however , cooke et al .  separated the magnetic contribution from the other degrees of freedom in terms of a simple debye model due to the lack of reliable lattice vibration data . based on their analysis",
    "these authors proposed a strong competition between large magnetic and lattice contributions to @xmath6 with opposite sign .    in 2004 , mryasov showed that it is also possible to model the transition with a heisenberg hamiltonian including bi - quadratic exchange interactions.@xcite in contrast to ref .",
    ", the rh moments were treated as induced by the magnetic moments of the surrounding fe .",
    "derlet introduced an empirical landau - heisenberg model with parameters fitted to existing ab - initio calculations .",
    "the paper concluded that a quadratic exchange term is needed to produce the transition and that both volume- and magnetic fluctuations are equally important  @xcite .",
    "barker and chantrell extended mryasovs model by fully expanding the quadratic spin interactions into four spin exchange terms , which were parameterized from experimental data.@xcite solving the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation using atomistic spin dynamics yields @xmath5 in good agreement with experiment .",
    "the dft calculations of sandratskii and mavropoulos pointed out that in the af phase hybridization between fe and rh states causes a local spin polarization of rh , which averages to zero.@xcite later on , kudrnovsk , drchal , and turek argued that the hybridization with surrounding fe moments is the main reason for the development of magnetic moments on rh atoms in the fm phase.@xcite the importance of hybridization effects in both , af and fm speaks against a simple stoner - like picture of an induced rh moment and rather for the presence of metastable magnetic states of rh .    recent work also aimed at incorporating finite temperature changes to the electronic structure arising from magnetic excitations .",
    "dek and coworkers evaluated the magnetic and electronic contributions to @xmath7 in their relativistic disordered local moment ( dlm ) approach.@xcite they were able to reproduce a transition from af to fm , albeit at a rather large temperature and atomic volume . in a similar spirit polesya et al .",
    "evaluated an extended heisenberg hamiltonian which only acts on the fe atoms , where the fm exchange interaction is scaled according to a response function dependent on the rh moments.@xcite with magnetic exchange parameters self - consistently obtained from uncompensated dlm calculations , which correspond to the average moment of the configuration , they obtain a very reasonable transition temperature of .",
    "a completely different route was taken by gu and antropov , who derived the magnetic contributions to the free energy and @xmath6 from the magnon ( spin wave ) spectra calculated from first - principles.@xcite in this approach , neither stoner - type nor spin - flip - excitations are considered . from the comparison with experimental data , the authors concluded that the magnetic degrees of freedom provide the dominant contribution to the transition .",
    "the relevance of a specific degree of freedom for the metamagnetic transition is reflected in its temperature dependent contribution to the specific heat @xmath8 and finally also to @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "a direct comparison of these calculated quantities with experimental data is thus inevitable to evaluate a specific model .",
    "this requires the detailed knowledge of all individual contributions to the gibbs free energy difference between the af and fm phase @xmath9 , which is usually divided into vibrational , magnetic and electronic degrees of freedom ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "so far , respective computational data are only provided by refs .  .",
    "experimental information on @xmath11 is available from refs .  ,",
    "while @xmath12 was measured by ponomarev.@xcite    this work aims at providing for the first time a comprehensive overview of the lattice dynamical contribution to the phase stability in ferh , from both the computational as well as the experimental point of view .",
    "with the notable exception of a pioneering inelastic neutron spectroscopy study of the phonon dispersion along the [ 111 ] crystallographic direction in the af state at room temperature  @xcite , and the recent determination of the element - specific debye - waller - factor by x - ray spectroscopy  @xcite , no experimental study on lattice vibrations of b2 ferh has been published to the best of our knowledge .",
    "very recently , a computational study reported unstable lattice dynamics in the b2 af structure in combination with a strain - induced softening of the shear elastic constant @xmath13.@xcite however , thermodynamic properties associated with the lattice degrees of freedom are still not available , yet .",

    "in the ordered cubic b2 structure ( cscl prototype ) ferh exhibits two major magnetic configurations , af coupling ( between the @xmath47 planes ) and fm coupling , which are close in energy and are visualized in fig .",

    ", the magnetic ground state for ferh was found to be the af configuration , where the fe atoms are coupled ferromagnetically within the 111 planes with alternating alignment of the spins in adjacent planes . in this configuration",
    "the rhodium atoms do not carry a magnetic moment .",
    "the fm configuration is slightly higher in energy ( compared to af ) and has a larger equilibrium volume . here",
    ", the rhodium atoms also possess a magnetic moment , which appears to be induced by the fe atoms .",
    "details can be found in table  [ tab : energies ] .",
    ".energy difference to the b2(af ) structure , lattice constants , cell volume , and local magnetic moments of the two studied magnetic configurations of ferh . energies and volumes are given per formula unit . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for rpbe , where the b2(af ) structure is stabilized because of the higher magnetic moments and the larger equilibrium volume , the @xmath482/@xmath49(af ) phase is higher in energy by if only the volume is optimized according to the rpbe functional .",
    "if we also allow the ions and the cell shape to relax again with rpbe , we find that the monoclinic phase is almost equivalent in energy ( favored by ) to the b2(af ) phase for this functional .",
    "the comparison of the different exchange - correlation functionals proves that from the computational point - of - view , the preference for the @xmath482/@xmath49(af ) ground state is a robust result .",
    "indeed , a closely related relaxation pattern as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : frozen_phonon ] ( missing the monoclinic distortion ) has been found experimentally in ternary bct ferh@xmath50pd@xmath51.@xcite experiments for binary b2 ferh applying hydrostatic pressures of up to did not reveal any indications for a new phase at room temperature and above in pure ferh.@xcite later experimental work  @xcite at higher pressures ( 10 to ) suggests a transition to a fct tetragonal structure with significantly reduced volume , which coexists with the b2 phase .",
    "the fact that the monoclinic phase has not been found in experiments for pure ferh until today , although it should be clearly distinguishable from the b2 phase given the large tetragonal distortion ( @xmath52 ) , requires some discussion .",
    "an early measurement by neutron diffraction reports a fe moment of  @xcite , which is clearly underestimated by all gga - type exchange - correlation functionals . according to our constrained moment calculations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : phonons_constrained ] ) , enhancing the fe moment to leads to a stable b2(af ) dispersion with standard gga , even if the lattice constant is fixed at @xmath53{\\aa}$ ] corresponding to the experimental value  @xcite .",
    "however , the gga is usually known to overestimate magnetic moments  @xcite ( rather than to underestimate them ) and increased magnetic moments would also destabilize the second fcc like minimum along the martensitic bain path , which has been experimentally observed for ferh under high velocity impact deformation or filing  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the extremely shallow minimum associated with the unstable phonon ( only energy gain in the cubic phase ) may be simply smeared out by kinetic fluctuations at temperatures larger than .",
    "we also know from first principle calculations that a small number of antisite defects are enough to suppress af order down to low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "it is thus possible that defects and slightly off - stoichiometric compositions also suppress the monoclinic af phase .",
    "nevertheless , careful adaption of the @xmath45 ratio or application of strain at low temperatures could still lead to a stabilization of the @xmath482/@xmath49(af ) low energy phase with its significantly reduced volume and magnetic moments .",
    "taking into account the magnetic configuration , the ferh lattice in the cubic af state belongs to the same point group as the l2@xmath54 heusler alloys like ni@xmath55mnga .",
    "these compounds similarly exhibit a soft acoustic phonon in [ 110 ] direction , albeit not at the zone boundary point @xmath56 or even @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the origin of the softening in ni - mn - based heusler compounds is a ni e@xmath57-peak right below the fermi level , which gives rise to extended plane nesting sheets in the fermi surface connected by the same wave vector describing the soft phonon .",
    "as pointed out recently , disordered equiatomic bcc - ferh under epitaxial strain undergoes a transition to an orthorhombic structure which shows signatures of a martensitic transformation , driven by a redistribution of electronic states away from the fermi level in combination with the removal of parallel features visible in selected fermi surface cross - sections  @xcite . in b2 ferh , however , the fermi surface of the af phase , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fs ] is rather small , which reflects the low density of states at the fermi level ( cf .",
    "[ fig : dos ] ) .",
    "it also does not exhibit obvious nesting features .",
    "lowering the energy of the cubic structure according to the soft phonon mode following the path displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : frozen_phonon ] does not lead to notable changes in the dos at the fermi level . instead ,",
    "peaks at 1.9ev and 4.2ev below @xmath58 , which arise from flat hybridized d - bands degenerate at @xmath0 , @xmath59 and @xmath17 , split up asymetrically according to the reduced symmetry .",
    "this reminds of a band - jahn - teller mechanism which is taking effect far below the fermi level .",
    "the overall gain in energy is very small and it is impossible to clearly separate the competing contributions .",
    "but we may speculate that the strong hybridization of rhodium and iron states in both the af and the fm phase , responsible for both the implicit splitting of rh in the af phase and the evolution of a net magnetic moment in the fm phase,@xcite is also decisive for the structural stability of b2 ferh .",
    "this could explain why rather different mechanisms such as increasing the local exchange splitting of fe via constrained magnetic moments , or decreasing the band width by increasing the volume , or shifting the relative position of the elemental orbitals using the gga+u approach , have the same consequence , i.e. , stabilizing the b2(af ) phase .    an instable phonon can open a downhill relaxation path to a new ground state structure , as the monoclinic structure for ordered ferh or the tetragonal l@xmath60 phase in the case of the heusler systems  @xcite .",
    "in ferh , the phonon instability is fragile and is connected to a much smaller energy gain compared to the heusler alloys .",
    "thus , in addition to the mechanisms discussed above , the relaxation path to the monoclinic ground state might easily be blocked by other perturbations as well , like a slight amount of chemical or magnetic disorder , or the presence of lattice defects . however , the phonon - induced modulations are no prerequisite for the existence of a ( meta-)stable monoclinic minimum .",
    "this is directly seen from a comparison of the electronic density of states ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dos ] ) , which exhibits entirely unrelated features for the b2 and p2/m phases , as well as the existence of the minimum for the monoclinic phase for the rpbe functional which predicts stable phonons in b2(af ) structure .",
    "this suggests , that the new phase might be stabilized at low temperatures under carefully designed external conditions , such as a sufficiently large pressure , by epitaxial strain and/or band filling , which tunes the af - fm transition as well.@xcite",
    "rh@xmath42 ( sample code ferh03 ) measured by @xmath14fe nrixs at ( a ) t = 59k ( af ) , ( b ) 305k ( af ) , and ( c ) 416k ( fm ) .",

    "it displays the fe - projected ( partial ) vdos , @xmath62 , of sample fe@xmath41rh@xmath42 ( code ferh03 ) measured at @xmath63k , 305k and 416k , i.e. , across the af to fm phase transition . in fig .",
    "[ fig : expvdos](a ) , the vdos of fe@xmath41rh@xmath42 at 59k ( when the sample is in the af state ) is characterized by three prominent phonon peaks : a pronounced sharp high - energy peak ( p@xmath54 ) at ( 31.0@xmath640.2)mev , a less pronounced medium - energy peak ( p@xmath55 ) at ( 25.5@xmath640.3)mev , and a very broad , weak low - energy peak ( p@xmath4 ) at ( 16.3@xmath640.5 ) mev . upon heating from 59k to 305k ,",
    "where the sample is still in the af state , the overall shape of the vdos essentially remains the same ( fig .",
    "[ fig : expvdos]b ) , however , we observe a slight red shift ( about 1% , averaged over the spectrum ) due to the effect of lattice thermal expansion . when the fe@xmath41rh@xmath42 sample is heated to 416k , the vdos ( fig .",
    "[ fig : expvdos]c ) distinctly changes in two aspects : ( i ) the height of the high - energy vdos peak p@xmath54 is drastically reduced to the height of p@xmath55 while its width increases ; ( ii ) the broad ( but weak ) low - energy feature p@xmath4 , centered at @xmath6516 mev , becomes remarkably narrower .",
    "in fact , the largest relative change in the broad feature p@xmath4 upon heating to 416k occurs at @xmath6510 mev , implying a reduction of an apparent shoulder ( p@xmath61 ) at ( 10.0@xmath641.5 ) mev that exists at 305k and 59k , but not at 416k .",
    "since @xmath66k is above the transition temperature of @xmath65380k , the sample fe@xmath41rh@xmath42 is in the fm state .",
    "this transition is clearly seen in the differences between the vdos in figs .",
    "[ fig : expvdos](a , b ) and fig .  [ fig : expvdos](c ) . apparently , the phonon spectrum of b2-ordered ferh depends on the type of magnetic ordering ( af or fm ) . since the transition occurs isostructurally , the drastic magnetism - dependent modification of the vdos observed in fig .",

    "we obtain an excellent agreement with the early measurement of ponomarev,@xcite which is up to now the only experimental benchmark for the free energy . from the close agreement between theory and experiment for specific heat , entropy and gibbs free energy ,",
    "we conclude that our decomposition provides a realistic estimate of the impact of the different degrees of freedom on the metamagnetic transition : we propose a cooperative and essentially equal contribution of the magnetic and the combined electronic and vibrational contributions of the rh - atoms , whereas the lattice contribution associated with fe is small .",
    "the availability of detailed information on the thermodynamic contributions of the lattice and the electrons opens a new route to benchmark the different magnetic models and  once specific heat , entropy , and free energy data are made available  may settle the long - standing dispute about the origin of the metamagnetic transition .",

    "<S> we present phonon dispersions , element - resolved vibrational density of states ( vdos ) and corresponding thermodynamic properties obtained by a combination of density functional theory ( dft ) and nuclear resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( nrixs ) across the metamagnetic transition of b2 ferh in the bulk material and thin epitaxial films . </S>",
    "<S> we see distinct differences in the vdos of the antiferromagnetic ( af ) and ferromagnetic ( fm ) phase which provide a microscopic proof of strong spin - phonon coupling in ferh . </S>",
    "<S> the fm vdos exhibits a particular sensitivity to the slight tetragonal distortions present in epitaxial films , which is not encountered in the af phase . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a notable change in lattice entropy , which is important for the comparison between thin film and bulk results . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations confirm the recently reported lattice instability in the af phase . </S>",
    "<S> the imaginary frequencies at the @xmath0-point depend critically on the fe magnetic moment and atomic volume . </S>",
    "<S> analyzing these non vibrational modes leads to the discovery of a stable monoclinic ground state structure which is robustly predicted from dft but not verified in our thin film experiments . </S>",
    "<S> specific heat , entropy and free energy calculated within the quasiharmonic approximation suggest that the new phase is possibly suppressed because of its relatively smaller lattice entropy . in the bulk phase , </S>",
    "<S> lattice degrees of freedom contribute with the same sign and in similar magnitude to the isostructural af - fm phase transition as the electronic and magnetic subsystems and therefore needs to be included in thermodynamic modeling . </S>"
