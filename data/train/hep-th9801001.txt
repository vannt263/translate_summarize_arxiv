    "in the approximately 20 years , which have passed from the time of understanding the role the topological nontrivial field configurations , such as kink @xcite , vortex @xcite and monopole @xcite,@xcite are playing in different branches of physics , considerable progress has been achieved .",
    "there is a large number of papers devoted to both the classical and quantum aspects of the problem .    nevertheless ,",
    "there are still some open problems connected with the description of the interaction between these objects as well as their interaction with the external fields . for example , by calculation of the static force between two monopoles @xcite as well as by description of monopole - monopole scattering @xcite , only the bogomolny - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) limit @xcite was considered .",
    "the same bps monopoles were studied by calculation of light scattering by a monopole @xcite .",
    "a typical feature of these calculations is their classical character .",
    "the main reason for using the bps approximation is that there are analytical solutions both for the monopole structure functions and its mass as well as a clear mathematical description of this classical field configuration . on the other hand , for the bps monopoles one can construct a moduli space of exact multimonopoles solution and describe their low - energy scattering by geodesic motion on this space @xcite .",
    "but , as was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , if one takes into account the quantum fluctuation on the monopole background field , there is no consistent bps limit because when one reaches it the quantum correction turns out to be increasing , causing the limiting transition to be impossible .",
    "another assumption in consideration of the interaction of the bps monopole with an external homogeneous magnetic field is just using _ ad hoc _ of the ansatz for the t hooft - polyakov field configuration moving with a constant acceleration @xcite,@xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we develop the consistent perturbative consideration of the problem of the interaction of nontrivial topological field configurations with external fields in a simple example of the kink acceleration and radiation in ( 1 + 1)-dimensional @xmath0 theory .",
    "the same approach applied to the consistent description of a more complicated case of the interaction between the t hooft - polyakov monopole solution and an external weak uniform magnetic field .",
    "we start from the lagrangian of a two - dimensional model @xmath1 where the dimensionless parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the potential of the model @xmath3 = \\frac{\\lambda}{4 }   \\left(\\phi ^2 - \\frac{m^2}{\\lambda}\\right)^2 + \\varepsilon   \\frac { m^3 }   { \\sqrt \\lambda } \\phi\\ ] ] has two minima ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "so , the lagrangian ( [ lagrang ] ) corresponds to the so - called thin - wall approximation @xcite , @xcite of the well - known problem of the spontaneous vacuum decay @xcite , @xcite .",
    "let us recall only that at @xmath4 the two vacua are degenerate and there is a topological nontrivial kink solution @xmath5 that interpolates between these vacua ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it can move uniformly along the @xmath6 direction that is connected with zero mode presence . if @xmath7 one can consider the problem as a kink under an external weak force which corresponds to the linear term in ( [ potential ] ) .",
    "note , that in the classical case this system has a very simple interpretation in the solid state physics : it is the continuum representation of the model of a structurally unstable ion lattice , having a double - well local potential and nearest - neighbor coupling @xcite .",
    "the kink configuration in this picture corresponds to the domain wall and the continuum modes ( @xmath8 ) are just phonons .",
    "let us consider the evolution of the kink after the metastable vacuum decay .",
    "in order to solve the field equation corresponding to the lagrangian ( [ lagrang ] ) @xmath9 we can use an expansion in powers of @xmath10 : @xmath11 .    in general , for calculation of the corrections to the kink field in @xmath12-th order of @xmath10 we have an equation @xcite : @xmath13 where the operator @xmath14 is @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17 is a function of all low order corrections @xmath18 .",
    "note , that parity of @xmath17 , as well as @xmath20 are interchanging from one order of @xmath10 to another .",
    "thus , one can pick out the asymptotic of the @xmath12-th order correction by definition @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "the boundary condition is that the functions @xmath23 tend to zero at @xmath24 .",
    "thus , the zero - order approximation gives the classical equation @xmath25 with the above - mentioned kink solution @xcite @xmath26    the first order corrections to the solution ( [ kink ] ) can be obtained from the next equation @xmath27 where @xmath14 is the operator ( [ second - der ] ) .    in order to find the corrections to the kink solution we can use the expansion of @xmath28 on the normalizable eigenfunctions @xmath29 of the operator @xmath14 which describe the scalar field fluctuations on the kink background ,",
    "i.e. one can write @xmath30 where the solutions of the eigenvalue problem @xmath31 are ( see e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath32   \\eta _ k ( z ) = e^{ikz } ( 3 \\tanh ^2~z - 3ik \\tanh z -1 - k^2 ) . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the corresponding eigenvalues are @xmath33 so , there is a zero mode ( @xmath34 ) , which corresponds to kink translation , a vibrational mode ( @xmath35 ) , connected with the time - dependent deformation of the kink profile , and continuum modes ( @xmath8 ) which in quantum theory correspond to scalar particle excitations on the kink background .",
    "these functions form a complete set which spans the space of any function of @xmath36 .",
    "the corresponding orthogonality relations are @xmath37    if we substitute the expansion ( [ expan ] ) into eq.([first - equ ] ) we obtain @xmath38    using the orthogonality relations ( [ ort ] ) one can make a projection of eq.([first - equ - exp ] ) onto the modes @xmath29 .",
    "the projection onto the zero modes gives the equation ( here we take into account that @xmath39 ) : @xmath40 with the solution @xmath41 it means that the correction to the kink solution due to zero mode excitation is ( here we suppose that @xmath42 ) : @xmath43 where the shift of the kink to the first order is given by @xmath44 the meaning of this correction is quite obvious : because the external force @xmath45 we introduced in ( [ lagrang ] ) in the first order is ( here @xmath46 is the energy density ) @xmath47\\ ] ] @xmath48 where the kink energy @xmath49 or its classical mass @xmath50 is @xmath51= \\frac { 2 { \\sqrt 2 } m^3 }   { 3 \\lambda}\\ ] ] we see that really the acceleration of the kink is given by the relation @xmath52 that is exactly the newton formula .",
    "the meaning of other corrections can be found in the same way .",
    "after the projection of eq.([first - equ - exp ] ) onto the vibrational mode @xmath53 we have @xmath54 i.e. there is no interaction between this mode and the external force .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( [ first - equ - one ] ) is defined up to an arbitrary constant that , from dimensional arguments , can be written as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is a dimensionless parameter fixed by the initial conditions at @xmath57 . in the framework of the classical theory it corresponds to the value of amplitude of the first vibrational mode .    as for the k - th mode belonging to the continuum one obtains @xmath58    calculation of the integral here gives @xmath59 and we have @xmath60 in case of the lowest mode of the continuum ( @xmath61 )",
    "it is just the equation for an oscillator in external field with the solution @xmath62 for all other continuum modes with @xmath63 we have the trivial oscillator equation @xmath64 using the above mentioned arguments one can write the arbitrary constants as @xmath65 , where the parametrs @xmath66 are fixed by the initial conditions .    thus , collecting the contributions from all modes of excitation ( [ first - equ - zero ] ) , ( [ first - equ - one ] ) , ( [ first - equ - k ] ) and ( [ first - equ - all ] ) , we find the first order correction to the kink configuration : @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the last two terms in this expression correspond to the fluctuation corrections to the kink solution and can be excluded if we take the initial condition at @xmath57 as @xmath70 for all k.    the first term , connected with the zero mode contribution , describes the motion of the kink with a constant acceleration , as mentioned above .",
    "the meaning of the second term can be clarified if one considers the corresponding correction in the asymptotic region ( @xmath71 ) , where we have ( up to fluctuation corrections ) @xmath72 indeed , the potential ( [ potential ] ) has the minima at @xmath73 given by eq.([phi - vac ] ) .",
    "thus , this term corresponds to a shift of the vacuum value of the scalar field ( see figs .",
    "the expression ( [ phi - one ] ) allows to calculate the first order corrections to the kink energy @xmath49 . substituting @xmath74 into eq.([kink - energy ] )",
    "we have , as one could expect , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the kink velocity .    note , that the changing of the kink kinetic energy is equal to the changing of the potential energy of the field due to linear perturbation , because @xmath77 and , in the same second order , for the large @xmath78 we have @xmath79    the second order correction @xmath80 to the kink solution @xmath5 ( [ kink ] ) can be found from the next equation : @xmath81 where @xmath14 is the operator ( [ second - der ] ) again and the first order correction @xmath28 is defined by ( [ phi - one ] ) .",
    "suppose that at the moment @xmath82 all oscillation modes are excited , i.e. we take @xmath83 for all values of @xmath84 . using again the expansion of @xmath85 on the eigenfunction @xmath29 of the operator @xmath14 we write @xmath86 substituting the expansion ( [ expan - two ] ) in equation ( [ second - equ ] ) after the projection onto the zero mode one can obtain : @xmath87 where",
    "@xmath28 is defined by eq.([phi - one ] ) .",
    "thus , we have @xmath88    it is obvious , that if oscillation modes at the initial moment were not excited the correction to the zero mode would be equal to zero . indeed , taking into account that @xmath89 because the integrand is an odd function , we can write the solution of eq .",
    "( [ lambda - two ] ) as @xmath90 where the amplitudes of the oscillations of the kink are @xmath91 @xmath92 and @xmath93 here we take into account that the integrals , which correspond to the transitions between different modes on the kink background are : @xmath94 note , that the amplitude of the excitation of the @xmath84-th continuum mode is exponentially supressed for @xmath95 .",
    "in fact , only @xmath96 will contribute .",
    "thus , collecting all terms together we have the next expression for the second order correction to the kink position : @xmath97    all these terms correspond to the oscillations of the kink by interaction with the vibrational modes .",
    "the first two terms in eq.([kink - corr - zero-2 ] ) with time - independent amplitudes correspond to the scattering of phonons on kink ( the first term ) or the capture of phonon by kink ( second term ) .",
    "the third term in ( [ kink - corr - zero-2 ] ) describes the oscillation of the kink due to interaction with the phonons created by the shift of the vacuum value of the scalar field ( [ phi - vac ] ) .",
    "other terms contribute to the friction of the kink and contain the corrections to the velocity and acceleration of it .",
    "the energy of the kink interaction with phonons can be calculated from the second order correction @xmath98 eq.([kink - corr - zero-2 ] ) . indeed , this correction is a sum of oscillations with the frequencies @xmath99 and different amplitudes @xmath100 .",
    "thus , for the large time interval @xmath101 the energy of each oscillation can be written as @xmath102 where @xmath50 and @xmath103 are the kink mass and velocity .    introducing the integration over momenta @xmath84 instead of sum",
    "one can obtain @xmath104 where the last term is the contribution of the first vibration mode .",
    "taking into account that @xmath105 we can estimate the total energy of interaction between the kink and phonons as @xmath106 that is much more than the second order relativistic correction ( i.e. @xmath107 ) .    in a simular way the second order corrections to the other kink modes can be obtained .",
    "note , that among them there are terms , which describe the production of kink - antikink pair .",
    "such a correction to the vibration mode @xmath108 was considered recently in @xcite . here",
    "we consider these corrections supposing that at the moment @xmath82 all oscillation modes are not excited , i.e. we take @xmath109 for all values of @xmath84 .",
    "we have already seen that in this case the correction to the zero mode is equal to zero .",
    "the correction of the second order to the vibrational mode @xmath53 can be calculated after the projection of ( [ second - equ ] ) onto this mode : @xmath110 the solution of this equation is @xmath111 where @xmath112 and up to fluctuations corrections at the large @xmath113 one has @xmath114    the simular equation for the correction to the lowest mode of the continuum ( @xmath61 ) @xmath115 obviously gives the trivial solution , because the integrand is an odd function .    as for the correction to the other continuum modes , after the projection onto the k-@xmath116 mode , we have @xmath117    taking again the limit @xmath78 we obtain @xmath118 the solution of this equation is @xmath119 and the oscillation correction here can be dropped again .",
    "thus , collecting the contributions of eqs .",
    "( [ lambda_2 - 1 ] ) , ( [ lambda_2-k ] ) , we obtain the time - dependent part of the second order correction to the kink classical field : @xmath120 the next order correction to the energy can be found when we substitute @xmath121 into eq.([kink - energy ] ) . using the orthogonality relations",
    ", we see that @xmath122 is orthogonal to @xmath80 and the non - zero is only the fourth - order correction    @xmath123    the first term in the roots corresponds to the kink mass changing due to its bounding with the @xmath124 mode .",
    "numerical calculation of the integral over @xmath84 in the roots gives the value @xmath125 , i.e. the second term in ( [ kink - energy-2 ] ) is , in two order , smaller then first one .",
    "this term corresponds to the correction to energy of the configuration connected with the continuum modes excitation .",
    "the thooft - polyakov monopole @xcite is a well - known static solution of the nonlinear yang - mills - higgs field equations .",
    "though considerable progress has been achieved in the last two decades , there are still open problems concerning the dynamical properties of monopoles .",
    "the most known results were obtained in the bogomolny - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) limit @xcite where the monopole dynamics changes drastically due to the masslessness of the scalar field .",
    "a calculation of the static force between two monopoles @xcite and of the light scattering by a monopole @xcite were based on an ansatz for the time dependence of the field which was just a replacement @xmath126 for the monopole position @xmath127 . that corresponded already to monopoles moving with a constant acceleration @xmath128 .",
    "in ref.@xcite as well as in the followed papers @xcite , the interaction between monopoles was considered in the region outside the monopole core where the yang - mills fields obey the free field equations . however , it is reasonable to expect a distortion of the core of the thooft - polyakov monopole and a bremstrahlung of both vector and scalar fields if an initially static monopole configuration is accelerated by an external field .    in this note",
    "we describe a consistent perturbative consideration of this idea . only the lowest - order result is presented here .",
    "it shows the monopole acceleration expected by the newton law .",
    "the next - to - leading corrections will decrease @xmath129 because of the radiation .",
    "let us consider the @xmath130d @xmath131 yang - mills - higgs model specified by the lagrangian : @xmath132 where @xmath133    in order to consider the interaction of this configuration with an external magnetic field let use the analogy with above considered example of the 2d kink motion .",
    "as in the @xmath134 model concidered above we introduce the lagrangian of interaction which is linear on scalar field : @xmath135 where @xmath136 is an external homogeneous constant magnetic field which is supposed to be small ( i.e. @xmath137 ) . taking into account the definition of the @xmath138 electromagnetic subgroup one can see that this term describes direct interaction between the magnetic field of the thooft - polyakov monopole and the external magnetic field .",
    "the field equations take the form : @xmath139 where the last terms represent the external force acting on the configuration .",
    "they read @xmath140    the key point of our approach is to treat the excitation of the zero modes of the monopole as a non - trivial time - dependent translation of the whole configuration .",
    "the amplitude of this excitation can be calculated from the field equation ( [ field - eq - ym ] ) . to this end , in analogy with the above considered case of the 2d @xmath0 model , we expand the fields @xmath141 : @xmath142 .",
    "the zero order approximation gives the classical equations @xmath143 with the thooft  polyakov monopole solution @xcite : @xmath144    note that in the bps limit @xcite ( @xmath145 ) , one has instead of the field equations ( [ zero - equ - ym ] ) a simpler first order equation @xmath146 then field equations ( [ field - eq - ym ] ) take the form @xmath147 this is exactly the manton s equation for a slowly accelerated monopole in a weak uniform magnetic field @xcite .",

    "( [ first - equ - mon ] ) in the form of an expansion @xmath155 on the complete set of eigenfunctions @xmath156 of the operator @xmath153 .",
    "these eigenfunctions consist of a vector- and a scalar component : @xmath157 describing the fluctuations of the corresponding fields on the monopole backgroung @xcite .",
    "substituting of expansion ( [ fexpan ] ) into eq.([first - equ - ym ] ) results in the following system of equations for coefficients @xmath158 : @xmath159    let us consider a correction to the monopole solution , contributed by the excitation of the zero modes @xmath160 where @xcite @xmath161 here",
    "the index @xmath84 corresponds to the translation in the direction @xmath162 .",
    "these modes are normalized in such a way that makes @xmath163 in expansion ( [ fexpan ] ) equal to the displacement of the monopole .",
    "note that these zero modes coincide with the pure translational quasi - zero modes of the vector and scalar fields   @xmath164 up to a gauge transformation with a special choice of the parameter which is just the gauge potential @xmath165 itself .",
    "a projection of eq.([expan - ym - modes ] ) onto the zero modes gives the following equation : @xmath166 ( note that the non - diagonal terms cancel ) , where the normalization factors of the zero modes are @xmath167 ^ 2    = \\int d^3 x \\left ( { f_{kn}^a } \\right)^2 ;   \\quad   n_s^2 = \\int d^3 x \\left[{\\eta ^a({\\bf r})}_0^{(k ) } \\right]^2   = \\int    d^3 x \\left({d_k \\phi^a } \\right)^2 . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] there is a very simple relation between the monopole zero modes normalization factors and the mass of the monopole @xmath50 : @xmath168 = m . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the integrals in the r.h.s .",
    "of eq.([modeym ] ) are calculable as well .",
    "we find @xmath169 where we take into account the definition of the monopole charge @xmath170 . in a similar way",
    "@xmath171 we would like to stress that the only zero modes along the external field direction @xmath172 are excited .    a substitution of eq.([orto - zero])([norm2 ] ) into eq.([modeym ] ) gives the final equation for the monopole zero mode evolution in the form @xmath173 .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath174 thus the monopole moves under external force along the external field direction with a constant acceleration @xmath175 .",
    "this corresponds to the classical newton formula with the lorentz force @xmath176 .",
    "the radiative corrections to this relation are given by the next orders of perturbation theory .",
    "note that the excitation of the monopole zero modes ( [ modeym - zero ] ) leads not only to the displacement of the solution but also to its time dependent gauge transformation @xmath177 : @xmath178 thus , the monopole motion in coordinate space is connected with its rotation in the isotopic space with a constant angular acceleration .",
    "it follows that the electric field of the accelerated monopole is @xmath179 as it should be .",
    "note that the lagrangian of interaction ( [ inter - mono ] ) is linear in the scalar field as well as its analog ( [ lagrang ] ) in 2d @xmath0 model .",
    "if one considers it as a correction to the higgs potential , then it also lifts the degeneracy of the vacuum ( see fig.3 ) . indeed , on the electromagnetic asymptotics the potential @xmath180 = \\frac { \\lambda}{4 } ( \\phi ^2 - a^2)^2 + \\frac{1}{a }   b_{n}^a \\phi ^a h_n^{(ext)}\\ ] ] has the minimum @xmath181 where the standard notation for the masses of scalar @xmath182 and vector @xmath183 particles was used .",

    "let us justify the form of the interaction lagrangian ( [ inter - mono ] ) .",
    "a direct interaction between the monopole configuration and an external homogeneous non - abelian gauge field do not affect the zero modes . indeed , let us introduce this interaction as @xmath185 where @xmath186 has only one non - zero component @xmath187 . in this case",
    "the field equations modified as @xmath188 @xmath189 the external force @xmath190 is now acting on the vector field only .",
    "it is orthogonal to the monopole zero modes , and , therefore , it does not excite them .",
    "indeed , @xmath191 this is equal to zero as an integral of an odd function .",
    "let us note that we could use the gauge invariant lagrangian of the electromagnetic interaction instead of eq.([inter - mono ] ) : @xmath192 however , the additional term in eq.([inter - mono-2 ] ) has no effect because the additional external force on the configuration which appears in r.h.s . of eq.([first - equ - mon ] ) is also orthogonal to the monopole zero modes ( [ modeym - zero ] ) .",
    "thus , the monopole interaction with the external electromagnetic field is determined only by the first term in eq.([inter - mono-2 ] ) which is eq.([inter - mono ] ) .",
    "the physical meaning of this result is quite obvious , because the second term in the gauge invariant definition of the electromagnetic field strength in ( [ inter - mono-2 ] ) corresponds to the dirac monopole string in the abelian theory .    finally , consider an interaction between two widely separated thooft  polyakov monopoles with charges @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "let us suppose that the first monopole is placed at the origine while the second one is at the large distance @xmath195 , @xmath196 stands for the core size . to the leading order in @xmath197 , the field of the second monopole can be considered as a homogeneous external field acting on the first one .",
    "thus , the electromagnetic part of the interaction is defined by the lagrangian ( [ inter - mono ] ) as before , where now @xmath198 and the first monopole will move with a constant acceleration @xmath199 .",
    "this corresponds to the classical coulomb force between the monopoles : @xmath200 .",
    "as it has been noted in @xcite , this simple picture is not valid in the bps limit . indeed ,",
    "in this case the scalar field is also massless and there are long - range forces mediated by both the scalar and the electromagnetic fields of the monopoles .",
    "the scalar interaction is given by the term @xmath201 in addition to the pure electromagnetic one ( [ inter - mono ] ) .",
    "as the bogomolny condition gives @xmath202 for both monopoles , it takes the form @xmath203 thus , the total lagrangian of interaction between two bps monopoles is just double eq.([inter - mono ] ) in the case of the monopole - antimonopole configuration and equal to zero in case of the monopole - monopole ( or antimonopole - antimonopole ) configuration .",

    "<S> the motion of a one - dimensional kink and its energy losses are considered as a model of interaction of nontrivial topological field configurations with external fields . </S>",
    "<S> the approach is based on the calculation of the zero modes excitation probability in the external field . </S>",
    "<S> we study in the same way the interaction of the thooft  polyakov monopole with weak external fields . </S>",
    "<S> the basic idea is to treat the excitation of a monopole zero mode as the monopole displacement . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation is found perturbatively . as an example we consider the interaction of the thooft - polyakov monopole with an external uniform magnetic field . </S>"
