    "we neglect the effects due to other low - order post - newtonian terms ( such as the lense - thirring precession and the frame dragging , etc . ) for the following reasons .",
    "( 1 ) the magnitude of the lense - thirring precession is relatively much smaller than that of the periastron advance , and the periastron advance has been included in the arma model ( see zly13 and @xcite ) ; ( 2 ) the other low - order post - newtonian effects do not lead to secular orbital decay of those pulsars ; and ( 3 ) although those effects may affect the orbital motion of individual stars in the vicinity of the mbh ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we obtain the evolution of the gc system in a _ statistical _ way through the arma model , which should be sufficient for the purpose of the study presented here .",
    "we trace the motions of those newly born pulsars until the end of our simulations . for each pulsar ,",
    "the calculation is terminated if its age reaches @xmath56  myr ( which is assumed to be the lifetime of active pulsars ) or if it is swallowed by the central mbh . if the lifetime of active pulsars is shorter than the assumed one , the number of the resulting pulsars decreases proportionally .",
    "a pulsar can directly plunge into and be swallowed by the central mbh if its angular momentum is less than @xmath57 ( and thus on an unstable orbit ; e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , although the tidal radius of the pulsar is smaller than the mbh event horizon .",
    "we remove those pulsars with angular momenta @xmath58 from our calculations .",
    "we record the simulated gc s - stars , hvss and active pulsars at the end of the monte - carlo simulations for each model .",
    "figure  [ fig : f1 ] shows the cumulative distributions of the semimajor axis and eccentricity for both the simulated gc s - stars ( thin lines ) and the pulsars ( thick lines ) obtained from different models . as seen from figure  [ fig : f1 ] , the resulting distributions of the semimajor axis and eccentricity of the simulated gc s - stars are more or less statistically compatible with the observations ( see also discussions in zly13 ) . further in consideration of the ratio of the number of the hvss to that of the gc s - stars and the velocity distribution of hvss , the disk - im2 model may match the observations better ( see also detailed analysis in zly13 ) .",
    "the distributions of the semimajor axis and the eccentricity of the active pulsars appear to be quite different from those of the gc s - stars , which is mainly due to : ( 1 ) the supernova kicks received by pulsars at their birth , and ( 2 ) the dynamical evolution timescale of the active pulsars ( @xmath59  yr ) is substantially longer than those of the gc s - stars ( at most a few times @xmath60  yr ) .    for each model ,",
    "we count the total number of those simulated gc s - stars with mass in the range of @xmath61 and semimajor axes @xmath62 , denoted as @xmath63 ; and we also count the final number of those simulated active pulsars with @xmath64 , denoted as @xmath65 . as the total number of the detected gc s - stars with @xmath62  is known to be @xmath66 @xcite , therefore , the total number of active pulsars at the present time can be estimated as @xmath67 for each model . by doing so , we estimate the total number of active pulsars ( with @xmath62 ) at the present time for each model as listed in table  [ tab : t1 ] . the disk - im2 model may match the statistical properties of both the gc s - stars and the hvss better as demonstrated in zly13 ,",
    "therefore , the total number of active pulsars with semimajor axes @xmath68  ( or @xmath69 ) is @xmath70 ( or @xmath71 ) in the preferred disk - im2 model if choosing a core - like density profile for the background stars .",
    "if choosing a bahcall - wolf cusp for the background stars , this number decreases slightly to @xmath72 ( or @xmath73 ) .",
    "the decrease of the number of the resulting pulsars is due to that the resonant relaxation process is more efficient in the case of a bahcall - wolf cusp than that of a core - like density profile , which leads to more pulsars being excited to extremely high eccentric orbits and being swallowed by the central mbh ( see also discussions in zly13 ) . the estimated number is smaller than the previous estimation ( @xmath74 by @xcite ) by one order of magnitude .",
    "the main reason for this difference is that we further consider the dynamical model of capturing stars by the central mbh in details , the effect of the imf , the dynamical evolution of the gc s - stars and pulsars , and the effect of the kick received by a newly formed pulsar at its birth , etc .",
    "for example , more than @xmath75 of the pulsars are ejected out from the immediate vicinity of the central mbh to infinity because of the kicks received by these pulsars at their birth .          the pulsar with the smallest semimajor axis ( and pericenter distance ) , if detectable , should be most helpful in probing the strong gravitational field and constraining the metric of the central mbh . in order to check whether it is possible to find a pulsar that is sufficiently close to the central mbh , we estimate the probability distributions of the semimajor axis and the eccentricity of the innermost pulsar resulting from each model above . to do so , we first randomly select @xmath76 pulsars from those active pulsars resulting from each model and record the properties of the one with the smallest semimajor axis among them .",
    "we repeat this procedure by @xmath77 times , and then use the recorded innermost pulsars to obtain the probability distributions of the semimajor axis and the pericenter distance for the innermost active pulsar .",
    "figure  [ fig : f2 ] shows the probability density distributions of the semimajor axis ( left panel ) and the pericenter distance ( right panel ) of the innermost pulsar resulting from different models , where @xmath78 is defined so that @xmath79 is the probability of being in the range of @xmath80 .",
    "as seen from figure  [ fig : f2 ] , the disk - th0 model results in an innermost pulsar relatively closer to the central mbh than all the other models .",
    "the semimajor axis distributions obtained from the unbd - ms0 model and the disk - im0 model ( or from the disk - th2 model and the disk - im2 model ) are similar ; and the models with small @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) result in an innermost pulsar more closer to the central mbh than the models with large @xmath81 ( @xmath83 ; see the left panel of figure  [ fig : f2 ] ) , as more binaries were injected into the immediate vicinity of the central mbh in the models with @xmath24 than that in the models with @xmath25 .    note there are two peaks in the pericenter distance distribution of the innermost pulsar resulting from the disk - th2 model and the disk - im2 model ( see the short dashed and long dashed lines in the right panel of figure  [ fig : f2 ] ) .",
    "the left peak ( close to the mbh ) is due to that the orbits of a number of pulsars , with small semimajor axes and large eccentricities ( e.g. , @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) , decay rapidly due to the gw radiation , while the right peak ( further away from the mbh ) represents those pulsars that are not significantly affected by the gw radiation .    as a comparison to the dynamical evolution of the gc pulsars ,",
    "the gw radiation plays little role in the orbital evolution of the simulated gc s - stars .",
    "the reasons for this are two folds : first , the lifetime of the simulated gc s - stars is only @xmath86  yr , which is much less than the gw decay timescale as these stars typically have semimajor axes larger than a few hundred ; second , for those simulated gc s - stars that can be excited to extremely highly - eccentric orbits ( @xmath87 ) , their orbits decay fast due to the gw radiation but they are more likely to be tidally disrupted and swallowed by the central mbh rather than survive to the present time .",
    "we define the most probable range of the semimajor axis ( or the pericenter distance ) of the innermost pulsar here as the range from @xmath88 percentile to @xmath89 percentile of the distributions , which is @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) , @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) , @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) , @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) , and @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) , for the unbd - ms0 model , the disk - th0 model , the disk - th2 model , the disk - im0 model , and the disk - im2 model , respectively .",
    "for all the models , including the reference model ( disk - im2 ) , the semimajor axis of the resulting innermost pulsar is @xmath100 ( corresponding to a period of @xmath101  yr ) , substantially smaller than that of the currently known gc s - stars . according to the probability distributions shown in figure  [ fig : f2 ] , the probability of the innermost pulsar with semimajor axis @xmath102 ( or @xmath103 ) is @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) , @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) , @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) , @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) , and @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) , for the unbd - ms0 model , the disk - th0 model , the disk - th2 model , the disk - im0 model , and the disk - im2 model , respectively .",
    "the existence of such a pulsar , if detectable , should provide a superb tool to probe the metric and determine the spin of the central mbh . as pointed out by (",
    "* see also @xcite ) that the frame - dragging signal or even higher order general relativistic effects could be detected by using the pulsar timing of a pulsar orbiting the central mbh with a semimajor axis smaller than a few hundred au if the timing accuracy is moderately high ( e.g. , @xmath114s ) .",
    "in fact , not every pulsar can be detected because of many factors , including the beaming effect and the scattering of radio wave by turbulent ionized gas between the pulsar and the observer .",
    "assuming that optimistically @xmath115 of the normal pulsars can be detected by future facilities , such as the square kilometer array ( ska ) ( see equation  2 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we also estimate the probability distributions of the semimajor axis and the eccentricity of the innermost `` _ detected _ '' pulsar for each model , which are shown in figure  [ fig : f3 ] .",
    "the most probable range of the semimajor axis ( pericenter distance ) of the innermost `` _ detected _ '' pulsar is @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) , @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) , @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) , @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) , and @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) for the unbd - ms0 model , the disk - th0 model , the disk - th2 model , the disk - im0 model , and the disk - im2 model , respectively .",
    "for majority of the models , the semimajor axis of the resulting innermost pulsar is probably still smaller than that of the currently known gc s - stars .",
    "however , the probability of the `` detected '' innermost pulsar with semimajor axis @xmath102 ( or @xmath103 ) is only @xmath126 ( @xmath127 ) , @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) , @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ) , @xmath113 ( @xmath127 ) , and @xmath131 ( @xmath132 ) for the unbd - ms0 model , the disk - th0 model , the disk - th2 model , the disk - im0 model , and the disk - im2 model , respectively .",
    "as the probability is not negligible , there might be still some chance to find a pulsar sufficiently close to the central mbh by future facilities that may help to constrain the mbh metric .        for case ( b ) , i.e. , all captured stars with mass @xmath133 turn to active pulsars when they end their main - sequence life , then the probability that the innermost `` detected '' pulsar has a semimajor axis @xmath102 is @xmath134 ( or @xmath135 ) , @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) , @xmath138 ( @xmath139 ) , @xmath140 ( @xmath141 ) , and @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) for the unbd - ms0 model , the disk - th0 model , the disk - th2 model , the disk - im0 model , and the disk - im2 model , respectively , if all ( or only @xmath115 of ) the resulting pulsars can be detected .",
    "these probabilities are larger than that obtained for case ( a ) above , which may strengthen the above conclusion that a pulsar substantially close to the central mbh may be found by future facilities and help to constrain the mbh metric .",
    "if alternatively adopting a bahcall - wolf cusp for the background stars for case ( a ) , the probability of the innermost `` detected '' pulsar with semimajor axis @xmath102 is @xmath144 ( or @xmath131 ) , @xmath145 ( @xmath146 ) , @xmath147 ( @xmath127 ) , @xmath107 ( @xmath131 ) , and @xmath148 ( @xmath149 ) for the unbd - ms0 model , the disk - th0 model , the disk - th2 model , the disk - im0 model , and the disk - im2 model , respectively , if all ( or only @xmath115 of ) the resulting pulsars can be detected .",
    "these resulting probabilities are only slightly different from that obtained above by adopting a core - like density profile for the background stars .",
    "therefore , qualitatively our main results are not affected by choosing a bahcall - wolf cusp for the background stars .",
    "the pulsars generated above are all formed by the collapse and explosion of the captured components of stellar binaries that were tidally broken up in the vicinity of the central mbh .",
    "it is possible that other mechanism(s ) may also bring pulsars to the immediate vicinity of the central mbh . for example : ( 1 ) some binaries with a pulsar component ( or even two pulsar components ) may be injected into the vicinity of the mbh and then tidally broken up with the pulsar component being captured .",
    "however , most of newly formed pulsars should be kicked out from binary systems by receiving the kicks due to supernovae explosion , and stay in isolate far away from the central mbh .",
    "it is reasonable to simply ignore the contribution by this mechanism .",
    "( 2 ) some isolated pulsars formed in the outer region of the gc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may migrate into the immediate vicinity of the central mbh via two - body relaxation .",
    "the typical timescales of the two - body relaxation in the s - star cluster region ( @xmath150  yr or larger ; see @xcite ) are far larger than the active time of pulsars ( @xmath151yr ) .",
    "therefore , the active pulsars within @xmath152 from the mbh should not be dominated by the pulsars resulting from the above two ways . in summary ,",
    "our results on the number and orbital distribution of the pulsars with semimajor axis @xmath68 are not significantly affected by considering the above two mechanisms .",
    "some hyperfast pulsars can also be produced by the process of tidal breakup of stellar binaries in the vicinity of the central mbh ( see * ? ? ?",
    "there are two routes to form such hyperfast pulsars in the scenario of tidal breakup of stellar binaries .",

    "the pulsars formed via this route also receive kicks at its birth and may thus gain energy and be ejected out from the gc with hyperfast velocities . according to the energy conservation law , the ejection velocity of pulsar is @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is the kick velocity , @xmath157 is the distance to the central mbh where the star explodes to form a pulsar , and @xmath158 is the semimajor axis of the progenitorial captured star . if @xmath159 , we have @xmath160 for most simulated gc s - stars ( @xmath161 ) , they can turn into hyperfast pulsars and be ejected out to the galactic halo / bulge only if they explode at a location close to their periapsis .    table  [ tab : t1 ] lists the number of the hyperfast pulsars ( with velocities @xmath162 ) via the first route and the second route , respectively .",
    "the reference model ( disk - im2 ) only produces several to about @xmath163 hyperfast pulsars that populate in the galactic halo , while the disk - th0 model can produce @xmath164 hyperfast pulsars .",
    "only a small fraction of these hyperfast pulsars may be beaming toward us , so that the detectable ones among them are not many . as seen from table  [ tab : t1 ] , the majority of the hyperfast pulsars are produced by the collapse and explosion of massive hvss ; and the contribution from the collapse and explosion of the captured massive stars is insignificant as only a small fraction of the massive captured stars exploded near their periapses can lead to the ejection of hyperfast pulsars .",
    "the hyperfast pulsars formed through the above two routes have velocities substantially larger than that formed in isolation or binaries . according to equation ( [ eq : vkick ] ) , the fraction of pulsars that can be kicked out to hyper - velocities @xmath165 is about @xmath166 .",
    "the current number of known pulsars is @xmath167 .",
    "therefore , there could be a few hyperfast pulsars having velocities @xmath165 formed in isolation or in binaries , and these hyperfast pulsars could be mixed with those formed through the above two routes .",
    "future pulsar surveys may find some hyperfast pulsars .",
    "however , it is not easy to identify whether a hyperfast pulsar is originated from the gc or not as the motion of a hyperfast pulsar formed through the first route could deviate significantly from the radial motion because of the supernova kick .",
    "in this paper , we estimate the number and orbital distribution of the pulsars currently existing in the vicinity of the mbh in the gc , by assuming that these pulsars are formed from the captured components of the massive binaries tidally broken up in the vicinity of the mbh .",
    "we follow the orbital evolution of those pulsars ( and its progenitorial stars ) by considering the effects of the limited stellar lifetime , the supernova kicks , the resonant and the non - resonant relaxations due to background stars , and the gw radiation . for the model that can simultaneously re - produce the statistical properties of both the observed gc s - stars and hvss ( i.e. , the disk - im2 model ) ,",
    "the number of pulsars with semimajor axis @xmath68 ( or @xmath69 ) is estimated to be about @xmath168 ( or @xmath1 ) . among them ,",
    "the closest one to the central mbh probably has a semimajor axis and pericenter distance in the range of @xmath169 and @xmath170 , respectively .",
    "the existence of pulsars in the gc is suggested by a number of indicative observations , including the pulsar wind nebular discovered by @xcite , many x - ray binaries discovered by @xcite and @xcite at a distance within one parsec from the mbh , and a magnetar recently discovered within a parsec distance from the central mbh ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , etc .",
    "the discovery of the magnetar is most encouraging because magnetars , i.e. , the magnetized pulsars , are a rare type of pulsars ; the discovery of a single magnetar in the central pc region is almost exclusively indicating the existence of a substantial number of normal pulsars within that region .",
    "recent systematic searches for pulsars did not detect any but gave an upper limit of @xmath171 normal pulsars in orbits within the central pc of sgr  a * ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the non - detection of pulsars in the gc for those searches may be partly due to that pulsar signals are strongly smeared by the hyper - strong scattering of radio waves by the turbulent ionized gas within the central @xmath172 of sgra*. the pulse broadening has a strong frequency dependence , @xmath173 , making it nearly impossible to detect any pulsar in the gc at the typical observing frequencies of @xmath174ghz",
    ". it may be possible to avoid of this smearing problem by searching pulsars at high frequencies ( @xmath175ghz ) .",
    "@xcite revisited the constraint on the number of potential observable pulsars according to the current observations by adopting more realistic assumptions ; they found a conservative upper limit @xmath176 for the pulsars in orbits within the central pc .",
    "the non - detection of pulsars in the gc is still compatible with our estimate of the number of the pulsars there ( @xmath70 , see table  [ tab : t1 ] ) .",
    "according to the method to estimate the number of observable pulsars developed in @xcite , the fraction of observable pulsars in the gc by the current facilities is @xmath177 ( see equation  2 in * ? ? ?",
    "as the expected total number of pulsars in the gc , with semimajor axes @xmath68 , is only @xmath70 , the detectable pulsars would be only @xmath178 ( or even zero ) by the current facilities .",
    "future radio telescopes , such as the ska , may be able to detect @xmath115 of the pulsars ( see equation  2 in * ? ? ?",
    "we expect that ten to twenty ( about one ) pulsars will be discovered with semimajor axis @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) in the gc by the ska . among",
    "the `` detected '' pulsars , the closest one to the central mbh probably has semimajor axis and pericenter distance in the range of @xmath179 and @xmath125 , respectively . for other models that can produce @xmath180 gc s - stars as observed , the total number of the `` detected '' pulsars , with semimajor axes @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) , are about @xmath181 ( @xmath182 ) , and the one closest to the central mbh may have a semimajor axis smaller than that resulting from the disk - im2 model .",
    "long term monitoring of those pulsars close to the central mbh would be helpful in constraining the environment and the metric of the central mbh .",
    "our preferred model also results in about ten hyperfast pulsars with velocities @xmath162 moving away from the milky way , and most of them are produced by supernovae explosions of the massive hvss ejected from the gc .",
    "some of these hyperfast pulsars may be detected by the ska in the future .",
