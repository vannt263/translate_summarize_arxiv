    "one of the fundamental issues of the observational cosmology is the evolutionary connection between various classes of galaxies .",
    "today , galaxies are classified with various criteria .",
    "the most classical classification of galaxies is the hubble sequence : elliptical galaxies , lenticular galaxies , spiral galaxies , barred spiral galaxies , and irregular galaxies @xcite .",
    "the main criterion of this classification is the morphology of galaxies ; that is , the existence , size ratio , and appearance of spiral arms , disc , bulge , and bar .",
    "the hubble sequence was established mainly based on the galaxies without nuclear activity , and such galaxies are often called _ normal _ galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "more and more galaxies showing active nuclei with broad line emission are being found ; they are often called _ abnormal _ galaxies . according to the features of the line emission , active galactic nuclei ( agn )",
    "host galaxies are classified into several sub - classes : seyfert 1 galaxies , seyfert 2 galaxies , broad - line radio galaxies , narrow - line radio galaxies , low ionisation nuclear emission regions ( liners ) , and so on .",
    "luminosity is another criterion to classify galaxies . @xcite",
    "defined the galaxies with m@xmath0 as _ dwarf _ galaxies .",
    "in addition to those general classes of galaxies , there are some unusual galaxy classes with interesting properties : e+a galaxies with the spectral features of both very old stellar populations and very young stellar populations @xcite ; ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) that are very bright in the mid- and far - infrared bands @xcite ; blue compact galaxies that show very compact morphology and high surface brightness with blue colour @xcite ; extremely red objects ( eros ) whose optical @xmath1 infrared colour is extremely red @xcite ; and so on .",
    "recently , to deal with a large amount of survey data , many astronomers have classified galaxies simply into red sequence galaxies and blue sequence galaxies according to their colour - magnitude relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for a long time",
    ", the individual properties of galaxies in those various classes have been investigated , and many efforts have been made to answer fundamental questions about galaxy evolution and connections between galaxy classes .",
    "some examples of such fundamental questions are as follows : why is there a conspicuous bimodality in the colour distribution of galaxies ?",
    "why does the colour bimodality not exactly agree with the morphological segregation ? how do the environments affect the properties of galaxies ?",
    "how did active galactic nuclei ( agns ) form ?",
    "is there any transition among the different classes of galaxies ?",
    "recent studies using large survey data discovered several interesting aspects of galaxy evolution , providing some answers to those fundamental questions .",
    "for example , @xcite studied the bivariate luminosity functions with galaxy type classification , and found that there is a clear morphological bimodality supporting the idea that merger and accretion are associated with bulges and discs , respectively .",
    "@xcite showed that both luminosity and colour of early - type galaxies are correlated with stellar velocity dispersion , and that velocity dispersion may be also closely correlated with the age and metal abundance of early - type galaxies .",
    "@xcite found that late - type galaxies show wider dispersion in several physical quantities than early - type galaxies , and that those physical quantities manifest different behaviours across @xmath2 mag .",
    "@xcite investigated the environmental effects on various physical properties of galaxies , finding that a key constraint on galaxy formation models is the morphology - density - luminosity relation .",
    "@xcite analysed the colour , 4000 break , and age in various spectral classes of galaxies , suggesting that the median light - weighted stellar age of galaxies is directly responsible for the colour bimodality in the galaxy population .    those previous studies , however , are not yet enough to explain the origins of the various galaxy classes and the evolutionary connections between the classes .",
    "one of the major limitations is that the galaxy classifications in most previous studies were often limited to only one or two properties .",
    "for instance , automatically - classified morphology ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , galaxy colour ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , or spectral line features ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are used frequently in recent studies based on large survey data , but a multilateral classification study using all these criteria at the same time has not yet been seen .",
    "such simplifications may be often very useful to understand the various and complicated phenomena in galaxy evolution .",
    "however , a simple classification can not distinguish detailed aspects of galaxy evolution .",
    "for example , early - type galaxies are often regarded as red and passive galaxies in most studies , but that is not always true .",
    "some kinds of galaxies with early - type morphology were found to have blue colours possibly originating from young stellar populations or active nuclei @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to understand these kinds of unusual classes in studies with simple classifications .    closely related to galaxy classification ,",
    "a couple of studies searching for principal components of galaxy properties have been conducted recently .",
    "@xcite examined the distribution of photometric , spectroscopic and structural parameters for 350 nearby galaxies using the millennium galaxy catalogue @xcite , arguing that most properties show a clear distinction between early - type galaxies and late - type galaxies . later , @xcite carried out principal - component analyses of the properties of 22000 galaxies at @xmath3 using the third reference catalogue of bright galaxies ( rc3 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , finding that the three parameters determining a galaxy s physical state may be mass , star formation and interactions / mergers .",
    "these studies presented how useful to consider various parameters in galaxy classification , although some important components like agns were not considered in their analyses .",
    "@xcite showed that multiple independent components , rather than any single component , may determine the various properties of galaxies .",
    "therefore , to understand the nature of galaxies more comprehensively and to give stronger constraints on galaxy evolution models to _",
    "explain all kinds of galaxies _ , it is necessary to investigate the nature of galaxies in various and finely - divided classes , and to find out the evolutionary connections between the classes .",
    "we have been doing a comprehensive study on a set of fine galaxy classes in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , based on their morphology , colour and spectral features . in this paper",
    ", the first in the series , we present the optical properties of galaxies in various fine classes .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 shows the data set we used , and  3 describes the methods to classify the sdss galaxies and to select volume - limited samples .",
    "we present the statistics of selected optical parameters and their luminosity dependence in  4 . based on the optical properties , we discuss the nature of galaxies in the fine classes in  5 . finally , the conclusions in this paper are given in  6 . throughout this paper",
    ", we adopt the cosmological parameters @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",

    "* ) in this study .",
    "the dr4 imaging data cover about 6670 deg@xmath7 in the @xmath8 bands , and the dr4 spectroscopic data cover 4783 deg@xmath7 .",
    "the photometric and spectroscopic observations were conducted with the 2.5-m sdss telescope at the apache point observatory in new mexico , usa . the median width of the point - spread - function in the @xmath9 band photometry is @xmath10 , and the wavelength coverage in the spectroscopy is @xmath11 .",

    "in addition , we use the velocity dispersion estimated using an automated spectroscopic pipeline called idlspec2d version 5 ( d. schlegel et al . 2008 , in preparation ) , and colour gradient , inverse concentration , and axis ratio of the sdss dr4plus @xcite sample , which is one of the products of the new york university value - added galaxy catalogue @xcite .",
    "after foreground extinction correction @xcite , the magnitude of each galaxy was corrected in two more aspects : the redshift effect ( k - correction ) and galaxy luminosity evolution ( evolutionary correction ) .",
    "we used the method of @xcite to conduct k - correction , and the empirical formula of @xcite to conduct evolutionary correction . using these methods",
    ", we corrected the observed magnitude of each galaxy into the magnitude at redshift z = 0.1 , where the sdss galaxies were observed most frequently .",
    "since the corrections are applied optionally in this paper , we denote the magnitude with k - correction as @xmath12 and the magnitude with both k - correction and evolutionary correction as @xmath13 , if the observed magnitude is @xmath14 .",

    "agn selection was conducted for the sample of galaxies with a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of @xmath48 for h@xmath20 , h@xmath44 , [ oiii ] and [ nii ] lines @xcite , but we classified some galaxies as agns even if their s / n ratios of one or two lines are smaller than 3 , in some special cases .",

    "this indicates that @xmath56regs may have blue populations in their outer parts , implying there may have been some gas infall from their outsides .",
    "agn host regs have larger negative colour gradients even than @xmath56regs , although the optical colour of agn host regs is comparable with that of @xmath55regs .",
    "we found that the axis ratio of agn host regs is significantly smaller than that of @xmath55regs , and the axis ratio of @xmath56regs is marginally smaller than that of @xmath55regs .",
    "these structural features imply that the infalling gas may have formed small disc components in the outer parts of non - passive regs .",
    "@xmath57regs are similar to @xmath58regs in their h@xmath43 equivalent width and d@xmath21(4000 ) , but @xmath57regs are slightly more concentrated , implying that the disc components may be smaller in @xmath57regs than in @xmath58regs .",
    "begs are the galaxies in the blue tail of the early - type galaxies in the colour versus colour gradient diagram @xcite .",
    "begs have concentration index comparable to that of regs , except for @xmath56begs , which are marginally more concentrated than @xmath55regs .",
    "the axis ratios of begs also agree with those of regs within very large sampling errors .",

    "compared to regs , however , begs have blue colour , positive colour gradient ( blue centre ) , large h@xmath43 equivalent width and small d@xmath21(4000 ) , indicating that begs have a large number of young stars , compared to regs . since begs have bluer centre than regs , it is considered that the young stellar populations in begs may be concentrated toward their centre unlike typical disc galaxies , which is consistent with the previous studies about blue spheroidal galaxies @xcite .",
    "begs are likely to be the early - type galaxies that recently accreted cold gas from a late - type neighbour during a close encounter or merged with less significant gas - rich galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xmath56begs have a larger positive colour gradient ( bluer centre ) than @xmath55begs , whereas @xmath56regs have a larger negative colour gradient ( bluer outside ) than @xmath55regs .",
    "in other words , the star formation of @xmath56begs seems to be dominant in their central regions , while the star formation of @xmath56regs seems to be dominant in their outer parts .",
    "it is noted that the structural features of @xmath56begs , @xmath55begs and @xmath55regs are similar .",
    "the major difference between these galaxy classes is that @xmath55begs have bluer centres and a younger stellar population than @xmath55regs , and that @xmath56begs have even bluer centres than @xmath55begs .",
    "however , the star formation activity in @xmath56begs will not continue forever , and the young stellar populations in begs will become older and redder as time goes on , if they do not suffer any interactions with other objects .",
    "this implies that @xmath56begs will probably evolve into @xmath55begs after their star formation ends , and that @xmath55begs may also evolve into @xmath55regs much later . in other words , @xmath56begs , @xmath55begs and @xmath55regs",

    "rlgs are bluer than regs . considering that the colour gradients of rlgs are significantly more negative than those of regs",
    ", we note that what makes rlgs bluer than regs may be the blue outer parts of rlgs ( i.e. blue disc components ) .",
    "the existence of blue disc components in rlgs is supported by the facts that rlgs are less concentrated than early - type galaxies ( for rlgs with axis ratio @xmath60 ) and that the axis ratios of rlgs are smaller than those of early - type galaxies .",

    "the concentrations of rlgs are similar among all spectral classes .",
    "the d@xmath21(4000 ) of @xmath55rlgs agrees with that of @xmath55regs , but the d@xmath21(4000 ) of non - passive rlgs is smaller than that of non - passive regs , and larger than that of non - passive begs .",
    "this indicates that the age composition of the stellar populations in rlgs may be intermediate between regs and begs , except for passive galaxies .",
    "we remind the reader that these spectral features are based on the central stellar populations in each galaxy , not entire populations .",
    "the d@xmath21(4000 ) features of rlgs , therefore , imply that rlgs may have a larger central bulge with old stellar population , compared to blgs .",
    "the fact that @xmath56rlgs are more concentrated than @xmath56blgs also supports this interpretation .",
    "the median axis ratio of rlgs ( including rlgs with axis ratio @xmath61 ) is smallest among all of the colour - morphology classes , indicating that there may be many disc galaxies with large inclination within the rlgs . in other words , intrinsic blgs with large inclination",
    "may be classified as rlgs , due to their strong dust extinction .",
    "it is noted that @xmath56rlgs have axis ratios decreasing as luminosity decreases ( see fig .",
    "[ laxis ] ) . intrinsically bright late - type galaxies with large inclination",
    "are dimmed due to the extinction in their discs , causing the small median axis ratio at the faint end .",
    "@xmath55rlgs have significantly larger axis ratio than @xmath56rlgs .",
    "a good explanation for this difference is that rlgs with large inclination may be classified as @xmath56rlgs rather than @xmath55rlgs , because their disc components may be observed within the spectroscopic fibre aperture .",
    "that is , many @xmath55rlgs may be bulge - dominated late - type galaxies with small inclination , so that only their bulge parts were covered in the sdss spectroscopy .",
    "however , @xmath55rlgs may also include genuinely passive spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "agn host rlgs have significantly larger axis ratios than @xmath56rlgs ( but smaller than @xmath55rlgs ) .",
    "this may be a selection effect caused by agn obscuration .",
    "since the agn emission may be difficult to observe in disc galaxies with large inclination , the median axis ratio of the observed agn host galaxies may be overestimated . in other words , agn host rlgs with small axis ratio ( i.e. large inclination )",
    "may be classified as @xmath56rlgs due to agn obscuration .      among all colour - morphology classes ,",

    "@xmath58blgs are significantly more concentrated than @xmath56blgs , while the concentration of @xmath57blgs is comparable with that of @xmath56blgs .",
    "this is possibly due to the difference in the brightness of the central agn between @xmath58blgs and @xmath57blgs .",
    "the axis ratio of agn host blgs is similar to that of agn host regs .",
    "however , the bulge - to - disc ratio of agn host blgs may be smaller than those of agn host regs , because the light profile of agn host blgs is much less concentrated than those of agn host regs . the large median axis ratio of agn host blgs may be due to the selection effect caused by agn obscuration , as mentioned in  [ drlgs ] .",
    "we conducted a comprehensive study of the nature of the sdss galaxies in various classes based on their morphology , colour and spectral features . using three criteria ,",

    "the median axis ratio in each class shows that some intrinsic blgs with large inclination may often be classified as red late - type galaxies , due to strong extinction by dust in their disc .",

    "<S> we present a comprehensive study of the nature of the sdss galaxies divided into various classes based on their morphology , colour , and spectral features . </S>",
    "<S> the sdss galaxies are classified into early - type and late - type ; red and blue ; passive , hii , seyfert , and liner , returning a total of 16 fine classes of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the luminosity dependence of seven physical parameters of galaxies in each class . </S>",
    "<S> we find that more than half of red early - type galaxies ( regs ) have star formation or agn activity , and that these active regs have smaller axis ratio and bluer outside compared to the passive regs . </S>",
    "<S> blue early - type galaxies ( begs ) show structural features similar to those of regs , but their centres are bluer than regs . </S>",
    "<S> hii begs are found to have bluer centres than passive begs , but hii regs have bluer outside than passive regs . </S>",
    "<S> bulge - dominated late - type galaxies have red colours . </S>",
    "<S> passive red late - types are similar to regs in several aspects . </S>",
    "<S> most blue late - type galaxies ( blgs ) have forming stars , but a small fraction of blgs do not show evidence for current star formation activity . </S>",
    "<S> differences of other physical parameters among different classes are inspected , and their implication on galaxy evolution is discussed .    </S>",
