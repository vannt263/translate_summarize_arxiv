    "calculation of heavy - light meson decay constants is important for the extraction of a number of ckm matrix elements .",
    "for example , @xmath6 . as decay constants are fairly easy to determine in lattice calculations and they will be measured at babar , kek and cleo - c , they provide an excellent opportunity to verify the accuracy of our methods .",
    "we are extending a calculation of heavy - light meson decay constants with three flavors of dynamical quarks that was begun in 2001 @xcite . in this calculation ,",
    "clover quarks are used for both the light and heavy valence quarks , the latter with the fermilab interpretation @xcite . a collaboration of fermilab and milc is now using light asqtad quarks with the same dynamical gauge configurations to calculate decay constants .",
    "the newer calculation @xcite will allow better control of chiral extrapolations , as it is practical to reduce the light valence quark mass .",
    "however , for @xmath7 and @xmath8 we expect the two approaches to be complimentary .    since the last time we reported on this calculation @xcite",
    ", we have greatly increased the statistics on two gauge ensembles with @xmath1 fm .",
    "( see table 1 . ) furthermore , preliminary results from a one - loop perturbative calculation of the axial - vector renormalization constant @xmath9 have been provided by el - khadra , nobes and trottier @xcite .",

    "in particular , we have not yet tried tadpole improvement , which should help to determine the size of our systematic error .",
    "we note that when we reported on this calculation at lattice 2002 @xcite , no perturbative or nonperturbative calculation of @xmath9 was available .",
    "we used an ad hoc procedure based on comparison of our improved action quenched results with the continuum limit of earlier calculations using the wilson gauge action and wilson or clover quarks .",
