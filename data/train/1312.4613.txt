    "the acceleration of our universe was first discovered by observing type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) @xcite . this unexpected discovery has been confirmed by the observations on cosmic microwave background , large scale structure , weak gravitational lensing , and hubble parameter . within the framework of general relativity ,",
    "the accelerating expansion is attributed to mysterious dark energy , which has an equation of state ( eos ) , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the pressure and energy density respectively .",
    "in addition to the cosmological constant , other many dark energy models have been suggested ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "eos @xmath6 is the most important parameter that describes the properties of dark energy . whether and how it evolves with time is crucial for revealing the physics of dark energy .",
    "the evolution of eos can be reconstructed from data using either parametric or nonparametric methods @xcite .",
    "simple parametric forms of @xmath0 have been proposed for studying the evolution of dark energy , such as @xmath7 @xcite and @xmath8 @xcite . reconstructing the eos of dark energy in a parametric method",
    "has been widely explored @xcite . however , a simplified dark energy parameterization is equivalent to a strong and not necessarily theoretically justified prior on the nature of dark energy @xcite . in order to avoid this shortcoming , the nonparametric approach was proposed @xcite .",
    "the procedure is to bin @xmath6 in @xmath9 , and fit the @xmath6 in each bin to data .",
    "this method assumes that @xmath0 is constant in each bin and has been widely used in the literature .",
    "the procedure is as follows : first performing a fisher forecast to determine the eigenmodes of the covariance matrix , and then fitting the constrained modes to observational data .",
    "the fisher matrix methodology has been used in predicting the ability of future experiments to constrain particular parameters of interest @xcite .",
    "the joint dark energy mission team proposed that this method can constrain binned 36 eos parameters with future data @xcite .",
    "another method has also been proposed , which puts prior directly on the space of @xmath0 functions @xcite .",
    "but the functions may be arbitrary .",
    "the gaussian process is another method of dealing with stochastic variables @xcite .    using the nonparametric methods , two distinctive evolution of @xmath0",
    "have been derived , one is consistent with the cosmological constant @xcite , and the other supports a dynamical dark energy model @xcite .",
    "zhao et al .",
    "found that a dynamical dark energy model which evolves from @xmath10 at @xmath11 to @xmath12 at higher redshift is favored using the wmap 7-year data and other cosmological observations @xcite .",
    "so the evolutional behavior of @xmath0 is controversial .",
    "more recently , the planck team has released the first cosmological results based on the measurement of the cmb temperature and lensing - potential power spectra , which prefer a low hubble constant and high matter density . in this paper",
    ", we estimate the evolution of @xmath0 using the latest cosmological observations including the planck data .",
    "we use the nonparametric technique to constrain the uncorrelated eos of dark energy @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this is a modification version of the method proposed by @xcite .",

    "if the eos is considered to be piecewise constant in redshift , then @xmath18 can be described as  @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the eos parameter in the @xmath21 redshift bin defined by an upper boundary at @xmath22 , and the zeroth bin is defined as @xmath23 .",
    "we choose 10 bins in our analysis , e.g. @xmath24 .",
    "previous studies only used less than five redshift bins .",
    "we fix @xmath25 at @xmath26",
    ". this assumption does not affect the derived results @xcite .",
    "the number of bins and the range are chosen to be large enough so that the derived results are stable to these choices .",
    "the luminosity distance depends on the integration of the behavior of the dark energy over redshift , so the eos parameters @xmath20 are correlated .",
    "the covariance matrix , @xmath27 is not diagonal . in the above equation , the @xmath28 is a vector with components @xmath20 and the average is calculated by letting @xmath28 run over the markov chain .",
    "we can obtain a set of decorrelated parameters @xmath29 through diagonalization of the covariance matrix by choosing an appropriate transformation @xmath30 we use the transformation proposed by  @xcite .",
    "first the fisher matrix is @xmath31 and the transformation matrix @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 the advantage of this transformation is that the weights are positive almost everywhere and localized in redshift fairly well , so the uncorrelated eos parameters @xmath29 are easy to interpret  @xcite .",

    "we use the distance priors @xcite from planck s first data release @xcite and wmap9 polarization @xcite , such as cmb shift parameters @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "the distance priors capture most of the information of the cmb data for dark energy properties , and the constraints derived from the distance prior are almost the same as those derived from the full analysis @xcite .",
    "for the baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) data , we use the sdss dr7 bao measurements at effective redshifts @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xcite , the wigglez measurements at @xmath41 @xcite , the boss dr9 measurement at @xmath42 @xcite , and the 6df galaxy survey measurement at @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the distance ratio vector of bao is @xmath44 the corresponding inverse covariance matrix is @xmath45 we also use the 28 independent measurements of the hubble parameter between redshifts @xmath46 compiled in @xcite .",
    "there are 12 cosmological parameters in our analysis , such as @xmath47 .",
    "we take @xmath48 as a free parameter in our calculation . according to the observations of planck",
    ", a flat cosmology is assumed .",
    "we also adopt @xmath49 statistic to estimate parameters .",
    "the likelihood function @xmath50 is then proportional to @xmath51 , which produces the posterior probability when multiplied by the prior probability .",
    "according to the posterior probability derived in this way , markov chains are generated through the monte - carlo algorithm to study the statistical properties of the parameters .",
    "we marginalize over the hubble constant @xmath52 @xmath53 from cepheid variables @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows the estimation of the uncorrelated dark energy eos parameters at different redshift bins .",
    "the dark energy eos is consistent with the cosmological constant at the @xmath2 confidence level .",
    "the eos shows a marginal oscillation feature ( from @xmath10 to @xmath54 ) around redshift @xmath55 , but from @xmath54 to @xmath10 at @xmath56 .",
    "the reconstructed eos is consistent with the cosmological constant in all redshift bins at the @xmath57 confidence level except for these three bins . in order to determine the need for complex form of @xmath0",
    ", we can calculate the improvement to the best fit , @xmath58 where the likelihood function @xmath50 is proportional to @xmath51 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 represent the likelihood functions calculated in best - fit @xmath61cdm and the best - fit @xmath62 model , respectively . in our calculation ,",
    "an improvement of @xmath63 is found with @xmath64 additional free parameters .",

    "the likelihood distributions are close to gaussian . at high redshift ,",
    "the probability distributions of @xmath20 span a wide range .",
    "we obtain the @xmath57 error bar around the best - fit value of the @xmath20 parameter .",
    "more standard candle data is required to reduce the error .",
    "long gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are promising candidates , because of their high luminosities and quasi - standard candle luminosity correlations .",
    "figure 3 shows the uncorrelated dark energy eos parameters at different redshift bins using sne ia+bao+planck+h(z)+grb data .",

    "figure 3 , we can see that the errors of eos are reduced significantly by including grbs . in order to show the importance of observation data in the planck era , we also present the constraint on uncorrelated dark energy eos parameters from sne ia+bao+wmap9+h(z ) data in figure 5 .",

    "previous studies only use less than 5 bins .",
    "we find that the uncorrelated eos is consistent with the cosmological constant at the @xmath2 confidence level .",
    "but if we use the cmb data from wmap9 , the results deviate from the cosmological constant at the @xmath2 confidence level at one redshift bin . at present , we find that the cosmological constant is consistent with observations , and no preference of a dynamical dark energy .",
    "we also find that the use of complex form of @xmath0 does not provide a statistically significant improvement over the use of the cosmological constant .    with an increasing data of supernova sample , and improvement in other cosmological observations ( such as cmb , bao , h(z ) )",
