    "the ` hot jupiter ' planetary companion to hd 80606 , discovered through the reflex radial - velocity ( rv ) signature of the parent star by @xcite , is notable for the high eccentricity of its orbit at @xmath7 .",
    "the existence of such a system provides a laboratory for testing models of planetary formation and evolution ( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) , particularly when the parent star is a member of a visual binary star , as here : its companion , hd 80607 , lies at a separation of @xmath8 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , corresponding to @xmath9 au at the distance of about 60 pc ( @xcite , hereafter l09 ) .",
    "the recent observation of a secondary eclipse of hd80606b by l09 with the spitzer space observatory gives insight into the effects on the planetary atmosphere of the highly variable insolation of radiation from the parent star as the planet undergoes changes in irradiation of @xmath10 fold .",
    "the importance of transits for characterizing the physical and atmospheric properties of exoplanets has been well documented ( e.g. see @xcite ) . given the remarkable nature of the orbit and irradiation of hd 80606b",
    ", a transit observation would be especially valuable .",
    "we reiterate here that transits determine the orbital inclination ( and hence true planetary mass ) , radius and density , and thus constrain internal planetary structure ( see @xcite ) .",
    "they also provide opportunities for sensitive observation of the planetary atmospheric composition through ir absorption - line studies of the transit ( e.g. @xcite ) , and emission properties during secondary eclipse ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "further , repeated , accurate measurement of the key parameters of the transit signal have the potential to probe more characteristics of the host planetary systems through a search for timing variations caused by resonant planets ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , satellites ( @xcite ) and kozai migration ( @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the reliable detection of a transit of hd80606b , combined with a timing of the secondary eclipse , would open up a very rich lode for investigation of the planet and host system .",
    "following their detection of a secondary eclipse at 8@xmath11 with the irac instrument with spitzer , l09 predicted the occurrence of a transit of hd 80606b with _ a - priori _ probability of @xmath1215% , according to the ephemeris ( l09 ) @xmath13 .",
    "the predicted event of @xmath14 ( 2009 february 14 , 0050 ut ) was well placed for observation from the uk , the object s declination meaning it would cross the meridian close to the zenith , and be available all night for continuous monitoring .",
    "given the expected duration of a central transit of about 17 hours , and the uncertainty on the ephemeris timing , a global campaign to search for the transit ingress and egress signals was launched by the transitsearch.org network .",
    "in this paper , we describe a search for a predicted transit signal by hd 80606b using the facilities of the university of london observatory ( ulo ) .",
    "our observations with two independent instruments show a clear signal which we interpret to be a transit egress .",
    "the university of london observatory , operated by ucl , is sited in mill hill , nw london .",
    "observations of known and candidate exoplanet transiting systems have been carried out for several years , and in particular have involved ucl undergraduate students in a campaign to monitor targets of specific interest .",
    "several undergraduate members of the campaign were recruited to assist with telescope operations , and two instruments were used to monitor the field of hd 80606 throughout the night .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : table2 ]      since the transit - like signal occurs in both data sets , we conclude it is of astrophysical origin .",
    "hd  80606 itself is not expected to be variable : indeed , the chromospheric activity of the star as measured by its caii h and k core emission ( @xcite ) is indicated to be quiet .",
    "we can show that the mid - transit time of our best - fit model is consistent with the ephemeris of l09 . using the model of k08",
    ", we calculate the difference between the primary and secondary eclipse mid - points . the orbit parameters and uncertainties of l09 then give a predicted mid - transit of @xmath15 hjd , compared to our observation of @xmath16 hjd , @xmath12 2.5 hours early but well within the predicted uncertainty .",
    "the observed egress duration and depth constrains the second contact to occur at @xmath12 1650 ut on 2009 february 13th , consistent with the absence of an observed ingress .",
    "further , we can use the k08 model with our best fit parameters to predict the secondary - eclipse duration .",
    "our model predicts @xmath17 hours and @xmath18 hours , completely consistent with the results of l09 who found @xmath19 and @xmath20 hours .",
    "we therefore conclude that there is a very high probability that the observed signal is indeed a planetary transit of hd80606b .     and @xmath21 .",
    "the black ellipse represents the previously derived one - sigma constraints from l09 .",
    "the two limits combined provide a highly precise measurement of @xmath22 .",
    "_ , width=8 ]      based on the timing between the secondary and primary transit , it is possible to derive precise constraints on the orbital eccentricity .",
    "l09 cited that the primary transit occurs only @xmath23 days after the secondary eclipse , short in relation to the 111-day period due to the extremely high eccentricity .",
    "the eccentricity has been derived from rv measurements , and the time delay between primary and secondary eclipse can be used to constrain it very tightly .",
    "typically , previous authors , for example @xcite , have used a first - order approximation of @xmath22 for such a calculation to derive @xmath24 , but in this case we are very far from a ` low ' value of @xmath22 .",
    "we have therefore used the k08 model to vary @xmath22 and @xmath21 such that it reproduces the observed delay of @xmath25 days and we plot the allowed parameter values in fig .",
    "4 .    our constraints on @xmath22 and @xmath21 can be seen to intersect the 1-sigma parameter space of l09 derived from independent rv measurements . combining both constraints ,",
    "we derive highly precise values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , or a precision in the eccentricity of 2 parts in 10000 .",
    "we have detected a transit - egress signature towards hd 80606 in two sets of photometry taken simultaneously on the night of february 13/14 2009 from the ulo , london , uk .",
    "the detection of the signal in two independent sets of photometry strongly supports an astrophysical origin for the signal .",
    "further , the moment of mid - transit is consistent with the ephemeris of l09 as well the egress duration being consistent with both the absence of observed ingress and the measured secondary - eclipse durations of l09 .",
    "we conclude that the signal is highly likely to be that of the transit of hd 80606b .",
    "the planetary radius of 1.03 @xmath3 , for a stellar radius of @xmath28 implies a planet density of @xmath29 , surpassing the density of the other known highly eccentric transiting planet , hd 17156b , and making hd 80606b an object of great interest to the field of planetary formation .",
    "hence , hd  80606b has the longest period and most eccentric orbit amongst the known transiting planets , making it an extremely unusual and interesting object for further study . the large change in stellar irradiation between primary and secondary eclipse offers an excellent opportunity for follow - up atmospheric studies .",
    "we note that very long transit duration allows for extremely precise measurements of mid - transit time , depth and inclination .",
    "therefore , any periodic or secular modification to these parameters due to a perturbing body would be easier to detect relative to other systems .",
    "the planet s orbit is much wider than other transiting planets , and taking into account a significant light - time travel effect of 2.75 minutes between secondary and primary eclipse , we have demonstrated that the eccentricity of this system can be determined to a level of 2 parts in 10000 .",
    "we derive a transit ephemeris of @xmath6 .",
    "finally , the work reported here continues to highlight the utility of co - ordinated global campaigns which promote the use of relatively modest telescope apertures to observe transits and help characterize exoplanet systems ; indeed , such campaigns have been actively encouraged through the oklo.org website of g. laughlin .",
    "the full characterization of the transit signal of hd 80606b will almost certainly depend on future co - ordination of observations made from multiple sites .",
    "we also emphasize the opportunities for useful work to be carried out from observing sites in locations  even london  which are not usually considered to be suitable for modern observational astrophysics .",
    "while there are bright stars hosting known or candidate transiting planets awaiting detection or characterization , this will remain true .",
    "[ we note that at the time this paper was submitted , two independent reports of a detection of this same transit event were announced  see moutou et al .",
