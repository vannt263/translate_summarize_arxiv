    "the macroscopic response of the spin - glass phase to a magnetic field change is linear at low enough fields @xcite .",

    "the response function , @xmath4 reflects the spin re - organization and appears stationary at observation times log(@xmath5 ) @xmath6 log ( @xmath7 ) and non - stationary when log(@xmath5 ) @xmath8 log ( @xmath7 ) , where @xmath7 is the effective age of the spin glass and @xmath5 the observation time of the experimental probe .",
    "the apparent age of the system is governed by the time spent at constant temperature ( wait time , @xmath9 ) or in a temperature dependent experiment by the cooling / heating rate . + in this study we have considered three model spin glasses of spatial dimensionality three , but with different spin dimensionality 1 , 2 and 3 : fe@xmath10mn@xmath10tio@xmath11 ( @xmath0 ) @xcite , eu@xmath10sr@xmath12mno@xmath13 ( @xmath1 ) @xcite and cu(mn ) ( @xmath2 ) @xcite . for all systems , we have studied the evolution and memory of the spin configuration that has been imprinted by a halt at constant temperature , @xmath3 , during cooling . the probe we have used in this study is the isothermal remanent magnetization ( irm ) that is attained by intermittently applying a magnetic field at the halt temperature . in the @xmath2 systems , a local and random dzyaloshinsky - moriya ( dm ) interaction@xcite is inherently at play @xcite . for comparison , we have also investigated a au(fe ) system , another three dimensional @xmath2 spin glass , however , with stronger apparent anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the probe materials are those listed in the introduction : an @xmath0 fe@xmath10mn@xmath10tio@xmath11 single crystal , @xmath14 @xmath15 21 k ) , an @xmath1 ( single crystal , @xmath14 @xmath15 18 k ) and two @xmath2 ( cu(mn ) polycrystalline , @xmath14 @xmath15 57 k and au(fe ) polycrystalline , @xmath14 @xmath15 24 k ) spin glasses , all of spatial dimensionality three @xcite . + the experiments were performed in an mpms superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometer with the low magnetic field option , allowing a weak , @xmath6 0.05 mt , residual field .",
    "+ the temperature dependence of the zero - field - cooled ( zfc ) , field - cooled ( fc ) and isothermal remanent magnetization ( irm ) of the samples was recorded using a probe field of 1 mt . the isothermal remanent magnetization ( irm ) was acquired by intermittently applying a 1 mt field during @xmath16=3000 s at constant temperature @xmath3 , ( @xmath17 @xmath15 0.7 ) after two different wait times @xmath9 ( 3 and 3000 s ) , and measured vs. temperature in two different thermal protocols illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - sketch ] . in the first procedure ( 1 ) , the sample is immediately cooled ( 10 k / min ) to a lowest temperature and the irm is measured on heating ( 1 k / min ) . in the second procedure ( 2 ) , the sample is cooled immediately after the irm has been acquired and measured on both cooling ( 1 k / min ) and heating ( 1 k / min ) . + the magnetic field employed in these experiments ( 1 mt ) is weak enough to yield linear response ; this implies that the global evolution ( aging ) of the spin configuration at constant temperature evolves `` undisturbed '' by this weak perturbation and that the system recovers a closely similar spin state at @xmath3 , after the cooling protocol ( memory ) .",
    "figure  [ fig - zfcfc ] shows the temperature dependence of the zfc , fc and irm magnetization of the four systems in reduced units .",
    "the @xmath0 sample is measured along the direction of the spins ( the @xmath18-axis of the ilmenite structure ) and perpendicular to this axis , in which case the susceptibility is much lower , reversible and only weakly temperature dependent ( c.f . fig .",
    "[ fig - zfcfc](a ) ) .",
    "the @xmath1 sample is measured in the @xmath19-plane of the layered tetragonal structure and perpendicular to this plane , in which case , the susceptibility is much lower , reversible and only weakly temperature dependent ( c.f .",
    "[ fig - zfcfc](b ) ) . in the following we consider and perform measurements on the @xmath0 and @xmath1 systems only in the spin directions , i.e. along the @xmath18-axis for the @xmath0 system , and perpendicular to it for the @xmath1 system .",
    "the two @xmath2 samples have isotropic magnetic properties ; the samples have cylindrical shape and were measured along the cylinder axis , and perpendicular to it for comparison .",
    "similar results were obtained in the two cases ; only the data collected along the cylinder axes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - zfcfc](c - d ) .",
    "the overall behavior of the susceptibility curves of the four samples show the characteristic spin - glass features : a cusp in the zfc curve , irreversibility between the fc and zfc curves below the cusp , and a weakly temperature dependent fc curve below the irreversibility onset .",
    "+ figure  [ fig - irm ] illustrates the temperature dependence of the isothermal remanent magnetization for the different samples .",
    "a superposed `` fc '' magnetization associated with the weak residual field in the magnet has been subtracted from the data in all cases ; the magnitude of this is of the order of the irm , see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig - irm](d ) , where the measured `` raw '' data of the magnetization of the cu(mn ) sample ( irm and background ) is plotted .",
    "the fact that the nominally zero field in the magnetometer in reality is a weak finite field does not affect the irm results of fig .",
    "[ fig - irm ] ; since the principle of superposition is valid for the recorded magnetisation response to a field change in the linear response regime @xcite .",
    "+ there are common features in the irm for all four samples .",
    "the irm is frozen in on cooling and shows only a weak temperature dependence on cooling and heating at low temperatures , and fades away rapidly as the temperature is increased above the temperature where it was acquired .",
    "a rather similar behavior of the irm would be observed also for a system of non - interacting ( or interacting ) magnetic nanoparticles with a distribution of particle sizes @xcite .",
    "also in common is a wait time dependence of the magnitude of the irm ; a larger magnitude is obtained for 3 s wait time than for 3000 s wait time at @xmath3 before the 1 mt field is applied for 3000 s. this difference is explained by the wait time dependence of the response function ; the increase of magnetization gets slower with wait time at constant temperature in spin glasses ( aging ) @xcite . also in common , is that independently of the wait time , the irm measured on heating after rapid cooling has larger amplitude than after slower cooling .",
    "+ there are however significant differences between the behavior of the irm for the different samples , possibly emanating from the spin dimensionality .",
    "the wait time at @xmath3 ( 3 s and 3000 s ) influences the magnitude of the irm in the sequence @xmath2 - @xmath1 - @xmath0 , going from strongest to weakest influence .",
    "this is in accord with the observation that the influence of aging on the response function follows the same sequence @xcite .",
    "the cooling heating curves for the @xmath1 and @xmath0 systems coalesce more rapidly below the halt temperature than the corresponding curves for the @xmath2 systems , irrespective of wait time at @xmath3 .",
    "the most striking difference is the pronounced maximum in the irm when returning to @xmath3 in cu(mn ) and au(fe ) .",
    "this feature does not appear in the other two samples , where the irm smoothly decays with temperature through and above @xmath3 . also , significantly , the heating curve in the protocol ( 2 ) where the sample is measured both on cooling and heating approaches closer to the curve measured only on heating ( protocol ( 1 ) ) in the neighborhood of @xmath3 .",
    "this behavior of the @xmath2 system implies that there is an additional memory component in the spin structure that is imprinted during the halt at @xmath3 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the spin structure of a spin glass is continuously re - organized at low temperature to adjust toward a structure that is most favorable at each temperature .",
    "this re - organization occurs always , and irrespective of whether a weak field is applied or a weak field is applied or removed .",
    "this implies that the magnetization that is recorded in an experiment may be composed of several independent superposed contributions .",
    "the pure irm ( as recorded during procedure ( 1 ) ) mirrors the excess magnetization that is acquired from an intermittent field application at constant temperature .",
    "this magnetization is frozen in on cooling to lower temperatures . during the time it takes to cool to low temperature and again",
    "heat the sample back towards @xmath3 , the spin structure is spontaneously reorganized on short time - length scales , however , a memory of the structure attained during the stop at @xmath3 remains @xcite . during this process also",
    "parts of the irm are lost due to relaxation and this is reflected in a lower value of the magnetization when @xmath3 is recovered . for the @xmath1 and @xmath0 systems",
    "this picture accords with the observations in fig .",
    "[ fig - irm ] , and one needs to make an ordinary memory experiment to realize that the spin configuration at @xmath3 does carry a memory of the equilibration that occurred during the original cooling @xcite . + the @xmath2 systems on the other hand ,",
    "show an additional directional memory of the equilibrated spin structure imprinted at @xmath3 . although a part of the irm apparently ( fig .",
    "[ fig - irm](a ) and ( b ) ) is lost due to the relaxation and restructuring that occurs during cooling and heating ( the relaxation is larger for cu(mn ) than au(fe ) ) , a large part of the original irm magnetization is recovered when @xmath3 is approached as the sample is reheated .",
    "this pronounced increase of the irm is surprising since it is not observed in the other two samples , where the part of the magnetization that has decayed during cooling heating remains lost also at @xmath3 . in the @xmath2 systems on the other hand both the equilibrated spin structure and the direction of the excess moment",
    "are recovered at @xmath3 .",
    "this property of the cu(mn ) and au(fe ) spin glass possibly reflects a reminiscence of the directional character of the dzyaloshinsky - moriya interaction inherent to the @xmath2 systems @xcite .",
    "+ interestingly , it was shown earlier that the critical exponents associated with the @xmath1 spin - glass phase transition had values between those of the @xmath2 and @xmath0 systems @xcite , and that ac or dc memory experiments suggested dynamical properties closer to those of @xmath0 systems .",
    "it is interesting to note that here the dynamical behavior of the @xmath1 system probed by the irm experiments is qualitatively similar to that of the @xmath0 system .",
    "we have investigated the dynamical magnetic properties of spatially three dimensional spin glasses by performing measurements of the isothermal remanent magnetization ( irm ) .",
    "qualitative differences in the irm curves of the different systems , which have different spin dimensionality ( 1 : @xmath0 , 2 : @xmath1 , or 3 : @xmath2 ) , were observed .",
    "our results suggest that in @xmath2 systems , the equilibrated spin structure and the direction of the excess moment of the irm are kept in memory , reflecting the directional character of the ( random and local ) dzyaloshinsky - moriya interaction inherently present in @xmath2 systems .",
