    "a primary goal of supernova research is an understanding of the progenitor stars and explosion mechanisms of the different types of supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "unfortunately , a sn leaves few traces of the star that underwent the catastrophic event .",
    "inferences concerning the nature of the progenitor can be made from the ejecta at late times ( fransson & chevalier 1989 ; leibundgut et al .",
    "1991 ) and by probing the circumstellar emission from the blast wave ( e.g. , fransson et al .  1989 ) .",
    "unambiguous information can be derived if the progenitors can be directly identified in pre - explosion images , but to date this has been possible for only three sne : sn 1987a in the lmc ( west et al .",
    "1987 ; walborn et al .  1987 , 1989 ) , and probably sn 1978k in ngc 1313 ( ryder et al .",
    "1993 ) and sn 1993j in m81 ( aldering , humphreys , & richmond 1994 ; cohen , darling , & porter 1995 ) .",
    "( the progenitor of sn 1961v has also been identified , but this event was most likely an @xmath0 carinae - like outburst , rather than a genuine sn ; see goodrich et al .",
    "1989 and filippenko et al .  1995a . ) in the absence of direct information about the progenitor stars , scrutiny of the host galaxies and local environments of sne continues to yield valuable clues to their nature .",
    "sne occur in at least three , and possibly four or more , spectroscopically distinct varieties ( e.g. , harkness & wheeler 1990 ; filippenko 1997 ) .",
    "type i sne are defined by the absence of hydrogen in their optical spectra . the classical sne  ia are characterized by the presence of a deep si  ii absorption trough near 6150    in their early - time photospheric spectra ( @xmath1 month past maximum brightness ) .",
    "members of the ib and ic subclasses , in contrast , do not show this line .",
    "moderately strong he  i lines distinguish sne  ib from sne  ic .",
    "sne  ii all exhibit hydrogen in their optical spectra , but the strength and profile of the h@xmath2 line vary widely among these objects ( e.g. , filippenko 1991 ; schlegel 1996 ) . at late times",
    "( @xmath310 months past maximum brightness ) , sne  ia show strong blends of co and fe emission lines .",
    "sne  ib and ic , on the other hand , are dominated by relatively unblended lines of intermediate - mass elements , such as o and ca , with sne  ic exhibiting larger line widths than sne  ib ( filippenko et al .",
    "sne  ii are dominated by the strong h@xmath2 emission line , but otherwise they spectroscopically resemble sne  ib / c at late times .",
    "photometrically , the light curves of sne i are all broadly similar , although sne ib and ic are somewhat fainter and redder than sne ia , whereas those of sne ii exhibit much dispersion ( filippenko 1997 , figure 3 ; patat et al .",
    "sne ii are subclassified into `` plateau '' ( sne ii - p ) and `` linear '' ( sne",
    "ii - l ) , based on the shape of their light curves ( barbon , ciatti , & rosino 1979 ; doggett & branch 1985 ) .",
    "previous ground - based studies of sn host galaxies and environments have primarily concentrated on statistical results .",
    "presumably caused by the core collapse of massive stars , sne  ii have been associated with a young stellar population ( e.g. , van dyk 1992 ) .",
    "the properties of sne ib and ic favor massive progenitors which lose their hydrogen envelopes prior to explosion ( e.g. , porter & filippenko 1987 ; filippenko 1997 ) , but their progenitors have not yet been unambiguously identified .",
    "wolf - rayet stars have been proposed ( see branch , nomoto , & filippenko 1991 and references therein ) , but a closer association with giant h  ii regions _ might _ be expected for consistency with this hypothesis ( panagia & laidler 1991 ; van dyk , hamuy , & filippenko 1996 ) .",
    "other possibilities include the off - center explosion of a white dwarf ( branch & nomoto 1986 ) or the explosion of he stars in binary systems ( e.g. , uomoto 1986 ) .",
    "the current paradigm of white dwarfs as progenitors of sne  ia rests partly on their location in the parent galaxies .",
    "sne  ia are not _ clearly _ concentrated toward star - forming regions ( maza & van den bergh 1976 ; van dyk 1992 ; mcmillan & ciardullo 1996 ) . on the other hand , a correlation between the global h@xmath2 brightness of the galaxy and the sn  ia rate has been established ( oemler & tinsley 1979 ; kennicutt 1984 ; van den bergh 1991 ) .",
    "bartunov , tsvetkov , & filimonova ( 1994 ) conclude that sne  ia occur in spiral arms with a frequency very similar to that of the massive sne  ii , but this is controversial .",
    "investigation of the local stellar and gaseous environments of sne can , in favorable cases , yield useful constraints on the ages and masses of progenitor stars and therefore resolve ambiguities and contradictions in the progenitor models .",
    "however , most studies of this kind have been hampered by the limited spatial resolution of ground - based observations ( e.g. , thompson 1982 ; richter & rosa 1984 ; huang 1987 ; van den bergh 1991 ; panagia & laidler 1991 ; van dyk 1992 ; van dyk et al .",
    "the superior angular resolution of the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) offers the potential for greater understanding of sn environments .",
    "an investigation using data from the _ hst _ archive was begun , as reported by barth et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , with the following goals : 1 ) to study the stellar populations in the immediate environments of sne in cases where individual stars or clusters are resolved , and to use this information to help constrain the age and mass of the progenitor star ; 2 ) to search for progenitor stars in images taken prior to sn explosions ; 3 ) to determine whether old sne are still visible ; 4 ) to augment the ground - based data on the statistical association of the different sn types with star - forming regions ; and 5 ) to measure magnitudes for sne observed `` accidentally '' while still bright , adding to existing ground - based light curves .",
    "we can also determine how sources in the fields of sne affect the late - time sn light curves ( boisseau & wheeler 1991 ) , and the photometry can be corrected for any contamination .",
    "as barth et al .",
    "( 1996 ) point out , although _ hst _ images offer the tremendous advantage of higher angular resolution over similar ground - based data , the _ hst _ images were almost exclusively obtained for purposes other than the analysis of sn environments , making it difficult to assemble a statistically meaningful sample ( although , as the present study demonstrates , this issue becomes less severe as larger numbers of host galaxies are imaged ) .",
    "additionally , one of the major limitations to a study of this kind is the small field of view of the _ hst _ cameras ; we find that many potentially useful images of sn host galaxies do not contain the sites of sne at all .",
    "also , exposure times are often chosen for the purpose of imaging galactic nuclear regions , and the underexposed sn sites are not particularly useful .",
    "finally , many galaxies are imaged through only one _ hst _ filter .",
    "the environments of several sne in pre - refurbishment hst images were studied by barth et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , but the results of this work were limited by the aberrated _ hst _ optics and by the small size of the pre - refurbishment archival database .",
    "van dyk et al .",
    "( 1999 ) recently examined the environment of the type ii - l sn 1979c in ngc 4321 ( m100 ) in post - refurbishment _ hst _ archive images . as a result",
    ", they were able to place more rigorous constraints on the mass of the sn progenitor , which may have had an initial mass @xmath418 @xmath5 . from additional",
    "_ hst _ multi - band imaging obtained 17 years after explosion , they also recovered and measured the brightness of sn 1979c .",
    "in this paper we report on the analysis of post - refurbishment _ hst _ archive images of some additional sn environments . as compared to the barth et al .",
    "sample , the number of environments is now significantly larger , to the point where we can begin to establish meaningful statistical results for the various sn types based on these _ hst _ data .",
    "additionally and most importantly , a number of galaxies hae been imaged deeply and through two or more filters , primarily for cepheid - based distance measurements , and several sn sites are in these images .",
    "therefore , for the first time , we can obtain photometry of individual stars and small clusters in sn environments , in order to constrain the ages and masses of the progenitor stars .",
    "we obtained from the _ hst _ data archive all non - proprietary post - refurbishment images of the host galaxies of all known sne available by 1996 july 9 , except when the nominal position of the image indicated that the sn site under consideration was definitely outside of the field of view .",
    "additionally , some datasets were not considered because the sne had very poorly known positions or unknown spectroscopic types .",
    "we also excluded from our sample all sn environments imaged as part of the _ hst _ supernova intensive study ( sins ) program ( pi : r.  p.  kirshner ) .",
    "only wfpc2 images from the archive met our selection criterion , and the vast majority were obtained as part of cycle 5 programs .",
    "all of the images had been processed by the routine wfpc2 calibration pipeline at the space telescope science institute ( stsci ) .",
    "the images used in this study were taken on or after 1994 april 23 , when the wfpc2 ccd temperature was adjusted . because most of the photometry we performed was in high background regions , the correction for any charge transfer efficiency effects would be on the order of , at most , a few percent , and we ignore these effects on the data . also , the near - ir quantum efficiency was stable for all observations ( see holtzman et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "table 1 lists the sne , their spectral types , host galaxies , wfpc2 detector containing the sn site , filters , observation dates , and total exposure times for the images which we have analyzed .",
    "the spectral types were generally obtained from the online asiago observatory sn catalog ( http://athena.pd.astro.it/@xmath6supern/snean.txt ; see barbon , cappellaro , & turatto 1989 ) , although other sources , such as iau circulars and the sternberg astronomical institute online catalog ( http://www.sai.msu.su/sn/sncat/ ; see tsvetkov & bartunov 1993 ) , were also consulted .      as can be seen from table 1 , a sn site is often found on one image taken through only one filter , in which case we can only describe the general appearance of the sn environment . a single image , in most cases , actually consisted of two or more exposures , which were combined to remove cosmic rays , using the combine task in the stsdas package of iraf . in cases",
    "where the image consists of only a single exposure , we used a routine by m.  dickinson which interpolates around cosmic - ray hits to remove them from the image .",
    "in other cases , images in more than one filter are available . of these",
    ", several cases discussed below allow us to resolve and perform photometry on individual stars and stellar objects in the sn environment .",
    "when stellar objects could be measured in the sn environments , we employed point spread function ( psf ) fitting photometry performed by daophot ( stetson 1987 ) and allstar within iraf , which is designed to handle conditions of severe crowding , ill - defined local background , and low signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio .",
    "stars were generally located on the images using daofind , with a detection threshold of 3@xmath7 , determined by the gain and read noise parameters for the image .",
    "the principal element of the psf fitting is an accurate model psf , ideally derived from the same image as the sn environment , using a sufficient number of bright isolated stars .",
    "this minimizes the problem of changing focus , chip distortions , spacecraft jitter , or pointing drifts , that causes psfs to vary with time and position .",
    "however , because of the severe crowding and lack of stars of sufficient s / n ratio on the archival images we analyzed , it was generally impossible to build a good model psf from field stars in these images .",
    "instead , we used the _",
    "tiny tim _ routine ( krist 1995 ) to produce an artificial psf , simulated to have stellar spectral type a and psf radius @xmath8 .",
    "the artificial psf was created at the center of the region of interest , to minimize possible systematic effects caused by the dependence of psf shape on position .",
    "a single model is sufficiently constant over the generally small ( @xmath9 ) region to fit all stars . in order to better match the width of our model psfs with stars in the image",
    ", we convolved the tiny tim psf with a gaussian .",
    "however , a subtle psf mismatch would not contribute as substantially to photometric uncertainties as would low s / n ratio , crowding , and background brightness fluctuations .",
    "in order to determine the possible systematic uncertainties in crowded field photometry , we added artificial stars with known brightnesses similar to our real objects .",
    "then , comparing their known magnitude with the outcome of the psf fit we correct the real object magnitudes accordingly .",
    "in general about @xmath100.1 mag is added to correct for systematic uncertainties .",
    "count rates were converted to magnitudes using either the synthetic photometric zeropoints listed by holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995 ; their table 9 ) or hill et al .",
    "( 1998 ; their tables 4 and 5 ) , appropriate for a @xmath8 aperture radius .",
    "( much of the data we could analyze using psf - fitting photometry were from the _ hst _ extragalactic distance scale key project , so for consistency we used the hill et al .",
    "zeropoints for these key project data . )",
    "the holtzman et al .",
    "zeropoints were determined for the 14 @xmath11 adu@xmath12 gain state , while the hill et al .",
    "zeropoints were determined for the 7 @xmath11 adu@xmath12 gain state .",
    "a correction for the gain ratio to either set of zeropoints shows that they are quite consistent with each other .",
    "when necessary , we corrected for throughput degradation , due to buildup of contaminants on the camera optics .",
    "the psf - fitting photometry often resulted in color - color and color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) for the stars in the sn environment . throughout this paper",
    "we express the magnitudes and colors in the wfpc2 synthetic magnitude system . to analyze these diagrams",
    ", we used the theoretical isochrones for solar metallicity from bertelli et al .",
    "( 1994 ; hereafter b94 ) , in order to constrain the ages and masses of the stars .",
    "these isochrones were computed for johnson - cousins @xmath13 and therefore require conversion into the wfpc2 synthetic magnitude system .",
    "we produced conversions via synthetic photometry of model spectra , using the task synphot within iraf / stsdas and the bruzual synthetic spectral atlas within synphot . in table 2",
    "we list our conversion formulae for the magnitudes and colors of interest ( those listed in the tables in b94 ) ; the agreement with the holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) empirical conversions is generally quite good . as noted in holtzman et al . , the passbands for the various filters in both filter systems are significantly different , and some filters , such as f336w , suffer from red leaks .",
    "magnitudes in the two filter systems tend to agree reasonably well for intermediate colors , but they diverge substantially for extremes in color . since many of the resolved stars are either very blue or very red , it is absolutely essential to perform these filter conversions .    additionally , as noted in holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , because of the difference in passbands , the extinction appropriate for the filters in each of the two systems differ .",
    "we determined the conversions for reddening and extinction in the johnson - cousins system to the wfpc2 synthetic filter system , assuming the reddening laws of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) .",
    "these conversions are given in table 3 .",
    "in some cases , where no resolved stars are apparent in the sn environment , we performed aperture photometry , applying the magnitude zeropoint for infinite aperture .",
    "the aperture photometry provides a larger - scale measurement of the magnitude , and where possible , color , of the general sn environment .",
    "additionally , in the case of some sn ia environments where stars could be resolved and subtracted , we obtained the magnitude and color of the unresolved diffuse background through aperture photometry in order to place a lower limit on the ages of the old stellar populations .",
    "van dyk ( 1992 ) and van dyk et al .",
    "( 1996 ) point out that a major factor affecting the results of a study of this kind is the overall uncertainty in sn positions within their parent galaxies .",
    "this problem is particularly severe for these high - resolution _ hst _ images . in all cases",
    ", we verified the _ hst _ image astrometry either against astrometry derived from ground - based images of the sn host galaxies or from careful visual inspection of available sn finding charts , or both .",
    "we found that , especially when the _ hst _ fine guidance sensor lock mode was either `` coarse '' or `` gyro '' , the image reference coordinates can be grossly in error ( by 5  10  or more ) . in `` fine lock ''",
    "mode , in particular , image coordinates are generally good to , or better than , @xmath142 ; for these images , the pixel positions of the sne sites could be determined using the image header coordinate information , correcting for known wfpc2 geometrical distortion .",
    "for the coarse - lock and gyro mode images , we estimated the pixel positions of the sn sites either by accurate offsets from a fiducial point , such as the galactic nucleus or an unsaturated star in the _ hst _ image , or from available sn finding charts , or both .    in all cases , we assign an estimated error centered on the nominal sn position and regard the error circle as the sn environment . this uncertainty radius varied from about @xmath15 in the best cases , to 10  in cases where",
    "the sn positions are based only on nuclear offsets , adopting marsden s ( 1982 ) estimate of these errors , even if the positional accuracy of the _ hst _ image is good .",
    "( it is our experience , from the work in van dyk et al .",
    "1996 , that the nuclear offset positions are actually not greatly discrepant with absolute positions ; we believe that marsden s estimate is a rather conservative , yet appropriate , one . )",
    "it is a pity that , given the high wfpc2 spatial resolution , sn sites can not be more precisely defined in the _ hst _ images .",
    "but , even with this relative lack of precision , the fine image detail afforded by _ hst _ in many of the sn environments considered here provides unprecedented information about these sn progenitors .",
    "here we present and discuss the results for the individual sne of each of the three main sn types .",
    "a pair of 80-s f606w wfpc2 exposures of ngc 4303 were available .",
    "three sne ii occurred in this galaxy : sn 1926a , sn 1961i , and sn 1964f .",
    "unfortunately , the site of sn 1961i is not on these images .",
    "( we consider sn 1964f in  3.1.3 . ) to find the site of sn 1926a on the _ hst _ image , we determined the position of the nucleus of ngc 4303 and used the nuclear offset , 11  w and 69  n , given in the online asiago sn catalog ; the uncertainty is assumed to be 10 .",
    "van dyk et al .  (",
    "1996 ) found that this sn was associated with an h  ii region of @xmath64   radius , offset from the nucleus by 8  w and 70  n. within the large error circle , we find that the sn appears to have occurred near two spiral arms , with several small clusters and associations of stars near the site . a small cluster to the west of the sn s nominal position contains stars with f606w magnitudes which range from about 23.4 to 24.4 . assuming a distance modulus @xmath16 ( tully 1988 ) , these imply @xmath17 to @xmath106.5 , corresponding to bright ( presumably massive ) supergiant stars .",
    "this galaxy was observed for the _ hst _ extragalactic distance scale key project , and the archive contains a large number of f555w images , and a lesser number of f439w and f814w images .",
    "many more images in these bands were planned , but we have used only those available before our cutoff date . we combined the individual images into a single image in each band .",
    "this galaxy has been host to two sne : sn ia 1969h , which is not in these images , and sn ii 1940b , whose environment is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the position of this sn is not accurate ( based on the nuclear offset , 95  e and 118  n ) , and we show the 10  error circle around the nominal position .",
    "the sn occurred near the edge of what appears to be two associations of bright , blue stars ( also see zwicky 1965 , his plate iv ) .",
    "we performed psf - fitting photometry on the combined images in all three bands , although we also analyzed the individual images , as a check on our results .",
    "we show in figure 2 the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) for the measured objects within the error circle ; most of them are in the bright associations . also shown",
    "are unreddened isochrones from b94 for various ages , corrected by the distance modulus @xmath18 to ngc 4725 ( gibson et al .",
    "the object at @xmath19 , f439w@xmath10f555w@xmath200.3 , f555w@xmath10f814w@xmath200.6 mag , in particular , is too bright to be a single star and is probably a compact star cluster .",
    "( although we have left the isochrones unreddened , examination of the cmds shows that reddening may be appropriate for some stars ; sn 1940b itself may have been somewhat reddened ; see minkowski 1964 , de vaucouleurs 1974 , and patat et al .  1993 . )",
    "the environment of sn 1940b contains many bright , young , blue stars , particularly in the large ob associations .",
    "several red stars , presumably red supergiants , with possible ages of @xmath6820 myr , are also seen on the cmds .",
    "the detected stars generally have ages , depending on the actual reddening , in the range @xmath6630 myr .",
    "sn 1940b may have been associated with the populations of young stars ; if the sn progenitor was a red supergiant , it may have had an age similar to the detected red supergiants , but could have been as young as 6 myr .",
    "the lack of a precise sn position , in particular , prevents us from being more restrictive about the nature of the progenitor .",
    "we have already discussed in  3.1.1 this image , on which we also find the site of sn 1964f .",
    "this sn has been identified in the literature as a sn i , but based on r.  barbon s re - examination of the sn spectra , the asiago sn catalog lists it as a sn ii . from the nuclear offset in the asiago catalog ( 28  w and 1  s ) , we derive a sn position , near which are several bright stars or clusters .",
    "these stars have f606w magnitudes which range from about 23.1 to 23.7 .",
    "again , adopting @xmath16 ( tully 1988 ) , these correspond to approximate @xmath21 magnitudes of @xmath107.8 to @xmath107.2 , which are likely bright ( massive ) supergiants or , possibly , small clusters of stars ( which may be true for the brightest objects ) .",
    "only a single f606w image of ngc 5597 is available .",
    "the sn position ( uncertainty radius 10 ) was derived from its nuclear offset ( 17  w and 13  s ) .",
    "the sn occurred near a spiral arm , with a number of bright stellar associations visible within the error circle , although the sn position does not closely coincide with any of them .",
    "one pair each of a medium - band f547 m and narrow - band f658n ( h@xmath2 ) and f502n ( [ o  iii ] ) images of ngc 4258 are available . sn was not spectroscopically classified , but is very likely a type ii , based on the properties of its radio emission ( van dyk et al .",
    "it appears to have occurred along the edge of the northeast arm in this galaxy , near several large h  ii complexes ( figure 3a ) .",
    "given the observed correlation of radio emission in sne ii with late - time optical emission ( chevalier & fransson 1994 ) , we might expect sn 1981k to have still been a relatively luminous optical emission source in 1995 , when these images were made .",

    ", we find @xmath23 erg @xmath24 s@xmath12 . for a distance to ngc 4258 of 7.3 mpc ( herrnstein et al .",
    "1997 ) , this corresponds to a luminosity of @xmath25 erg s@xmath12 ( not corrected for reddening ) . for comparison , fesen et al .",
    "( 1999 ) recently estimated the dereddened late - time h@xmath2 luminosity for sn 1979c to be @xmath26 erg s@xmath12 .",
    "if this is not the sn , but instead an unrelated emission source in the environment , then we can place an upper limit on the h@xmath2 emission at the position of the sn : @xmath27 erg @xmath24 s@xmath12 , or @xmath28 erg s@xmath12 .",
    "we see from figure 3b that the [ o  iii ] emission in the field appears to be particularly associated with the cores of the bright h  ii complexes .",
    "the [ o  iii ] emission within the error circle , even at the position of the faint h@xmath2 source , is extremely faint . if the h@xmath2 emission is from sn 1981k , the relative lack of [ o  iii ] emission would be consistent with the shock / circumstellar matter interaction model by chevalier & fransson ( 1994 ) .",
    "figure 3c shows the continuum counterpart of the faint h@xmath2 source , as well as some associated nebulosity or unresolved stars .",
    "the source has @xmath29 mag , or , for the distance modulus @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "a nearby small cluster of stars can also be seen inside the northwest edge of the error circle .",
    "the brighter stars among them have @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 mag ; the faint star nearby has @xmath35 mag .",
    "these stars have @xmath36 , and @xmath37 mag , respectively .",
    "although we do not have any color information for this environment , these magnitudes are consistent with those of supergiant stars .",
    "the fact that little h@xmath2 emission is associated with these stars implies that they are non - ionizing , cooler , possibly yellow or red supergiants .",
    "thus , sn 1981k may be associated with a population of evolved supergiants , with no recent star formation occurring in its immediate environment .",
    "given that the radio emission for the sn possibly arises from the sn shock interacting with the progenitor s red supergiant wind ( van dyk et al .",
    "1992 ) , this would also imply that the sn s progenitor was a red supergiant of relatively low mass ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "a pair of f606w images of the highly - inclined galaxy ngc 4490 were available . from the nuclear offset ( 35  e and 20  s ) for sn ii 1982f ( from the asiago sn catalog ) , we derive a position for the sn near the edge of the pc chip .",
    "sn 1982f occurred just outside the main body of ngc 4490 .",
    "the stars nearest the sn position have @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 mag . given the distance modulus ( @xmath42 ; tully 1988 ) , these correspond to @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 mag , and are probably bright supergiant stars .",
    "this sn ii belongs to a peculiar class , known as sne iin ( schlegel 1990 ) , which show narrow emission profiles atop broader bases in their spectra , particularly at h@xmath2 , possibly arising from the sn shock interacting with very dense circumstellar matter .",
    "sn 1986j was first discovered in the radio and subsequently followed optically ( rupen , van gorkom , & gunn 1987 ; leibundgut et al .",
    "1991 ) ; it was missed in optical sn searches near the time of explosion .",
    "the sn is a very luminous radio source ( weiler , panagia , & sramek 1990 ) and should also still be a luminous optical emission - line source .",

    "sn 1993r is classified as peculiar type i ( filippenko & matheson 1993 ) , with substantial differences from the late - time ( nebular ) spectra of normal sne ia .",
    "the spectrum of sn 1993r somewhat resembles that of the subluminous sn ia 1991bg ( filippenko et al .  1992 ; leibundgut et al .",
    "1993 ) , yet the ca ii near - infrared triplet is strong in sn 1993r and very weak in sn 1991bg .",
    "the spectrum differs from the nebular spectra of sne ib and sne ic , in that the [ o i ] 6300   emission is weak in sn 1993r .",
    "in addition , the sn appeared to be photometrically subluminous near maximum brightness .",
    "an approximate absolute position was given for sn 1993r by treffers et al .",
    "( 1993 ) . we have measured a more accurate absolute position from an @xmath122-band image taken by b.  leibundgut and w.  vacca at the lick observatory nickel 1-m telescope on 1993 august 18 ut . using the _ hst _ _",
    "guide star catalog _",
    "positions for foreground stars seen on the image , we derive a position of @xmath123 , @xmath124 ( 2000.0 ) .",
    "the image header coordinate information for the _ hst _ images is erroneous , so , given the sn s absolute position and the absolute position ( also from the lick image ) of an unsaturated foreground star on the _ hst _ images , we located the sn site on the images using the offset between the sn and the star .",
    "we adopt a positional uncertainty of 1  for this offset .",
    "we show the sn environment in figure 22 . from the measured position , the sn occurred along the bright circumnuclear ring in the galaxy , in a region of patchy emission and dust .",
    "filippenko & matheson ( 1993 ) reported that the sn is superposed on a very bright h  ii region .",
    "this region appears as a bright knot just outside the error circle for the sn in the _ hst _ images and is not directly coincident with the sn location .",
    "this likely compact cluster has @xmath125 mag , f336w@xmath10f555w=@xmath101.29 , f555w@xmath10f675w=0.71 , and f555w@xmath10f814w=0.01 mag . for a distance modulus @xmath126 ( tully 1988 )",
    ", it has @xmath127 mag and colors consistent with young , blue stars ( the f555w@xmath10f675w color is almost certainly contaminated by h@xmath2 emission ) .",
    "two stellar objects just outside the error circle have , respectively , @xmath128 mag , f336w@xmath10f555w=@xmath100.50 , f555w@xmath10f675w=0.54 , and f555w@xmath10f814w=0.71 mag ; and , @xmath129 , f336w@xmath10f555w=@xmath101.06 , f555w@xmath10f675w=0.15 , and f555w@xmath10f814w=0.11 mag .",
    "the former object appears to be either a very bright red star or reddened compact cluster ; the latter is likely a blue compact cluster . removing these stellar objects from the images and measuring the colors and magnitude for the environment ,",
    "we find @xmath130 , f336w@xmath10f555w=0.10 , f555w@xmath10f675w=0.67 , and f555w@xmath10f814w=0.93 mag . these colors are significantly redder than the individual objects and are consistent with a mixture of a through k stars , but also may be due to reddened fainter blue populations .",
    "a set of short- and long - exposure f555w and f814w images are available .",
    "sn ia 1994d is clearly seen on the _ hst _ images ; it occurred along the edge of the central dusty disk of this host galaxy , just beyond or north of the prominent dust lanes ( figure 23 ) .",
    "although the sn is saturated in the long - exposure images , only the central pixels of the sn profile are saturated in the shorter exposures .",
    "we have measured the magnitudes of the sn in the two _ hst _ filters by using the wings of the stellar profile and interpolating the flux lost in the saturated portion of the profile .",
    "we used the unsaturated magnitudes of the field star ( which is `` star c '' in richmond et al .",
    "1995 ) , also seen on the image , as a reference .",
    "we find @xmath131 and @xmath132 mag for sn 1994d on 1994 may 9 ut .",
    "these values agree well with @xmath133 and @xmath134 mag for 1994 may 8 ut by richmond et al .",
    "( our measurements for the field star magnitudes , @xmath135 and @xmath136 mag , also agree well with richmond et al.s magnitudes for this star . )",
    "the sn environment is dominated by diffuse starlight in the host galaxy .",
    "we averaged the measurements of the magnitude and color of the sn environment on the deeper images through two @xmath8-radius apertures , placed on either side of ( and outside ) the wings of the saturated sn psf .",
    "we find that @xmath137 and f555w@xmath10f814w=1.52 mag in the environment , which is quite red .",
    "undoubtedly , dust must be contributing to the colors of this environment , but taken at face value , the color implies the presence of k - type stars , presumably giants , in the sn environment in this early - type host galaxy .",
    "we have conducted an analysis of sn environments in post - refurbishment _ hst _ archival data . due to the superior resolution of _ hst _ , the results of this study are a significant improvement over those involving ground - based data or our previous study of pre - refurbishment _ hst _ data ( barth et al .  1996 ) .",
    "we have accomplished several of our main goals set out for this project .",
    "( 1 ) for the first time , through deep multicolor imaging undertaken by the _ hst _ cepheid projects , in particular ,",
    "we have been able to produce color - color and cmds for several sn environments , providing constraints on the ages and masses of stellar populations associated with the sne , and allowing us to indirectly infer the ages and masses of the sn progenitors ; this is true for sne 1940b , 1983v , 1987k , and , to a lesser degree , 1988 m .",
    "( 2 ) we have identified the stellar progenitor of sn 1997bs , clearly visible on a pre - sn _ hst _ image , and we find that the progenitor was a luminous supergiant star .",
    "( 3 ) we have searched for old sne on the images , being successful in the cases of sne 1979c ( see van dyk et al .",
    "1999 ) , 1986j , and possibly 1981k , as expected , since these three objects showed evidence of interaction with circumstellar gas .",
    "if the late - time light curves of other sne declined exponentially , many or most should be well below detectability . also , several sne had substantially more complicated environments and imprecise positions , thwarting our attempts to detect them at late times .",
    "( 4 ) we can , based on the archival data , advance the statistical association of the different sn types with star - forming regions .",
    "( 5 ) in the case of sn 1994d , which was caught `` by accident '' on _ hst _ images , we can measure its brightness , augmenting existing ground - based light curves for the sn .",
    "the immediate environments of four sne ia considered above contained bright clusters and h  ii regions with which these sne ia might have been associated .",
    "however , van dyk ( 1992 ) has shown that sne ia are more likely chance superposed on recent star formation regions than physically associated .",
    "we expect that sn ia progenitors , based on the current models , should be considerably older and fainter . in three cases",
    ", we were able to do detailed analyses , based on cmds , of the younger stars in the environments . removing the younger stars , through psf fitting , allowed us to measure the colors of the underlying diffuse stellar emission , which may be due to populations similar to those of the sn ia progenitors .",
    "the colors of the diffuse emission provide suggestive indications that the stellar populations are generally old and red , consistent with red giants .",
    "since we are unlikely to measure the intrinsically faint individual stars in the stellar populations associated with sn ia progenitors , regardless of the depth of the _ hst _ exposures ( except possibly for the cases of local group galaxies ) , we hope in the future to continue to amass statistics which can place more stringent constraints on the nature of sn ia progenitors .",
    "the four sne ib and ic that we have included in this study seem more closely associated with brighter , more massive stellar regions than is the case for the sne ii in our sample , which tend to be associated with smaller , fainter stellar associations .",
    "van dyk et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , from their ground - based survey , found no difference in the association of the two sn types with massive stellar regions .",
    "we caution that the conclusions in the current paper are based on very few sne ib / c and a small number of sne ii ; we clearly need to accumulate better statistics to confirm or refute this trend .",
    "but , taken at face value , the high - resolution _ hst _ images suggest that the sne ib / c progenitors may be more massive , in general , than the sne ii progenitors .",
    "exploding wolf - rayet stars have been proposed as possible progenitors for sne ib / c , and our limited results are consistent with this scenario .",
    "fortunately , the environments of several sne in our study have recently been imaged as part of other _ hst _ projects , for longer exposure times and in various bands .",
    "we will continue to acquire images for these , and other environments , as they become available in the future and will build on the current study in future papers . with the ever - increasing number of images filling the _ hst _ archive , we intend to enhance our sample significantly .",
    "moreover , as new relatively nearby sne occur , we will hunt directly for the sn progenitors on pre - sn images .",
