    "a constant effort has always be devoted to the search for new effects and materials to control the propagation of light waves . over the past few years , in particular , the use of quantum interference has led to an astonishing control of light waves propagating through specific classes of atomic and solid state media .",

    "such a widely discussed phenomenon arises from quantum interference and is characterized by a strong enhancement of the refractive index dispersion within a narrow frequency window around the medium resonance where absorption turns out to be largely quenched .",
    "the study of such a phenomenon goes back to the late seventies when non - absorbing resonances in atomic sodium have first been observed by gozzini s group and later interpreted in terms of coherent population trapping  @xcite .",
    "the interest for such a phenomenon has revived  @xcite over the past decade and has now become a rather topical area of research  @xcite , much work being done on fundamental issues : high nonlinear coupling between weak fields and quantum entanglement of slow photons  @xcite , entanglement of atomic ensembles  @xcite , quantum memories  @xcite and enhanced acousto - optical effects  @xcite , just to mention a few . in particular , a strict analogy between slow - light in moving media and light propagating in curved space - times has been unveiled and some of its consequences have been recently discussed  @xcite .",
    "recently it has been also anticipated in  @xcite that eit media are ideal candidates for the observation of extremely low and negative group velocities and ( apparently ) superluminal behaviour . in such media ,",
    "the group velocity can in fact be readily tuned over a wide range of negative values directly by varying the coupling and probe detunings in a standard three - level @xmath2 configuration .",
    "although most slow light and negative group velocity experiments have dealt with the basic problem of a light pulse delay during its propagation across the dispersive medium , ultraslow positive or negative group velocities can have interesting consequences in many different scenarios . in this paper",
    "we present a thorough investigation of slow - light propagation through a moving medium .",
    "specifically , we examine a configuration in which a highly dispersive eit medium which moves with uniform velocity and normally to an incident light beam of finite spatial extent .",
    "the same geometry was adopted in the early seventies by jones in his pioneering work on the _ transverse _ fresnel - fizeau light drag effect  @xcite leading to the observation of a very small downstream bending , i.e. , in the direction of motion , of a light ray .",
    "the use of a strongly dispersive medium supporting slow light , rather than the non - dispersive glassy material used by jones , will not only allow for a remarkable enhancement of the drag effects but also for qualitatively new features .",
    "the possibility of having light propagating with small negative group velocities across the dragging medium is predicted to yield large _ upstream _ light bendings , i.e. in the direction opposite to that of the medium .",
    "the phenomenology of such an a anomalous fresnel - fizeau light drag effect , which has been the subject of an old controversy during the late seventies  @xcite , is here discussed in detail unwinding some of its controversial aspects .    for sufficiently fast dragging speeds",
    ", the correct description of the slow light transverse dragging effect requires that absorption dispersion and group velocity dispersion be taken into account . as we shall see below",
    ", it turns out that these higher  order dispersion terms introduce new and peculiar features , such as propagation along curved light paths and the restoration of the spatial coherence of a noisy beam .",
    "all the numerical results presented in this paper have been obtained using realistic parameters taken from slow - light experiments in ultra - cold atomic clouds  @xcite . since the physics of the system",
    "is essentially determined by the electromagnetically induced transparency effect , the physical features here discussed are however extremely general and hold through also for the recently prepared solid state eit media .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ sec : downstreameit ] and in sec .",
    "[ sec : upstream ] : in the former case , the group velocity is small and positive , so the transverse fresnel drag occurs in the usual downstream direction ; in the latter case , the negative group velocity is shown to give an anomalous upstream fresnel drag . in sec.[sec : higherorder ] we proceed to discuss some effects which arise from the inclusion of higher order dispersion terms .",
    "we carry out a complete analysis for two specific instances . in one case ,",
    "the beam spectrum reshaping due to absorption and group velocity dispersion , which makes the average group velocity to bend during propagation , is seen to lead to curved light paths . in the other ,",
    "the frequency dispersion of absorption is seen to act as a filter for spatial fluctuations of the beam , whose space coherence properties improve as it propagates through the medium .",

    "a related effect was discussed in the time domain in  @xcite where a small time - dependence of the group velocity for a light pulse propagating through a dispersive dielectric was predicted to show up as a consequence of the combined effect of the frequency dispersions of absorption and of group velocity .    )",

    "as one can verify by comparing the spectrum in fig.[fig : tilt2]a with the group velocity spectrum in fig.[fig : tilt2]c , most of the incident beam spectrum lies in the negative group velocity region ( @xmath178 ) , so the beam is initially dragged in the upstream direction . as absorption is weaker for the @xmath160 components for which the doppler - shifted frequency @xmath179 is closer to resonance ( @xmath180/\\partial",
    "k_x<0 $ ] , see fig.[fig : tilt2]b ) , the negative @xmath161 components are more rapidly quenched than the positive @xmath160 components and the center of mass @xmath181 of the spectral distribution moves towards the positive @xmath160 values . as one can see in fig.[fig : tilt2]c , @xmath182 in the region @xmath183 of interest and therefore the curvature of the beam will be towards the downstream direction .",
    "after the first @xmath184 of propagation , most of the @xmath26 spectrum is found in the positive @xmath51 region ( @xmath185 ) , so that the transverse fresnel - fizeau drag is from now on in the downstream direction ( fig.[fig : tilt1]a ) .    as a consequence of the shift of the spectral center of mass @xmath186 , the beams exits from the rear face of the medium at a small but finite angle with respect to the normal towards the downstream direction .",
    "although this effect is hardly visible on the scale of fig.[fig : tilt2]a , this small bending of the beam direction may have a significative effect on the subsequent rectilinear propagation of the beam in the free space .",
    "unfortunately , this effect of non - rectilinear propagation is associated to a rather severe absorption of the beam ; for the specific case in figure , the transmitted intensity is of the order of 5% of the incident one ( fig.[fig : tilt1]b ) .",
    "it is also worth noticing that the curvature effect described in the present section follows from a reshaping of the beam in momentum space and hence is physically different from the ones discussed in  @xcite , which instead originate from a non - uniform velocity field of the slow - light medium .",
    "if both probe and coupling beams are exactly on resonance ( @xmath187 ) , both absorption @xmath188 and group velocity @xmath189 dispersion vanish , so that the effects described in sec.[sec : tilt ] do not take place . in the present subsection , we shall show how one can rather take advantage of the large value of @xmath190 to improve the coherence level of a noisy incident probe beam .",
    "in sec.[sec : temporal ] , the case of _ temporal _ coherence restoration in a stationary eit medium will be adressed , while in sec.[sec : spatial ] we shall show how the same concepts can be applied in the case of a moving eit medium to improve the level of _ spatial _ coherence .",

    "the propagation of a pulse through a stationary dielectric medium is described by the usual fresnel equation : @xmath198 in the neighborhood of the resonance at @xmath199 , the dielectric function of a slow light eit medium can be approximately written as : @xmath200 where @xmath87 is the group velocity at resonance and the real quantity @xmath201 is given by : @xmath202 at the lowest order in @xmath203 , the real and imaginary parts of the wavevector @xmath204 can then be written as : @xmath205 .",
