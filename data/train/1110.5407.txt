    "x - ray emission from the central region of a starburst galaxy is known to be complex because of blending of various kinds of point sources and diffuse emission . although point source emission typically dominates the hard band , in some starburst galaxies including , the emission line from he - like is observed , suggesting the existence of a high temperature plasma ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) , associated with starburst activity , are considered to be a candidate of the origin .",

    "the coexistence of highly ionized and neutral fe lines suggests the coexistence of hot and cold gases .",

    "heasoft version 6.11 , sas 10.0.0 , ciao 4.3 and xspec 12.7.0 were used for data reduction and spectral analysis . for all fitting processes , we adopted c statistics and binned spectra so that each bin contains @xmath5 counts after a background subtraction .",

    "the redistribution matrix files ( rmfs ) and ancillary response files ( arfs ) were created with the xisrmfgen and xissimarfgen ftools @xcite , respectively . since the bright region is within several tens of arcseconds , which is much smaller than the _ suzaku _ point spread function ( psf ; @xmath8 as a half - power diameter ) , we assume the source to be a point - source when creating the arf files . the accumulation of dark earth observations was used to estimate the non x - ray background ( nxb ) spectra , via the xisnxbgen ftool @xcite .",
    "we subtracted nxb , the dominant background above 5 kev , but not the x - ray background , which was evaluated by an offset observation next to our field as to be less than 3 % of the flux in r0 .",
    "the spectra and responses of xis0 and xis3 were merged using the ftools mathpha , marfrmf and addrmf .",
    "we utilized pn data from two _ xmm _ observations ( obsid:0125960101 and 0152020101 ) with the effective exposure time of 31 and 54 ksec after removing flared time intervals which is over 0.35 counts / sec above 10 kev .",

    "we analyzed the level 2 _ chandra _ acis - s event data .",

    "the difference , @xmath110 @xmath11 , was smaller than the statistical error .",
    "_ suzaku _ xis achieved an energy scale accuracy better than 6 ev at 6 kev @xcite , which means that the systematic error on the energy center is much smaller than the statistical error .",

    "chandra_. hence , the neutral emission may be more extended than the ionized emission or variable .",
    "the smaller ews of the _ suzaku _ and _ xmm _ observations are because of a higher continuum due to the emission from the disk .",

    "@xmath150 % and 30 % of the observed total and lines are emitted only from p1 as shown in figure [ fig : chandra - acis - spectra ] left .",

    "p3 is the brightest in the 1.3  mm radio continuum and is featured by the water maser associated with star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      to extract physical parameters we fitted the wide - band spectra ( 0.810  kev ) of p1 , where the highest line flux was confirmed .",
    "we adopted two - temperature thermal plasmas in collisionally ionization equilibrium plus a gaussian whose centroid is 6.4 kev as the neutral fe k line .",

    "however , we focus on the very compact p1 region with a radius of 24 pc , which shows the most luminous line structure .",
    "we calculate the contribution from ( i ) point sources such as cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , active binaries and high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , ( ii ) snrs and ( iii ) cold molecular clouds .",

    "the expected number density of cvs is on the order of @xmath80 pc@xmath76 , assuming that their number density can be scaled from the stellar density @xcite .",
    "therefore the contribution of these point sources seems low .",
    "hmxbs are also one of candidates with typical luminosity of 10@xmath81   @xmath63 for fluorescent line @xcite .",

    "the resultant number of snrs is about 240@xmath1520 which is consistent with the estimated value by the luminosity .",
    "this suggests that the very dense massive star cluster in p1 exists , which is consistent with the results of the mid infrared observations .",
    "molecular clouds that are irradiated by surrounding x - ray sources would emit a fluorescent line .",
    "we assume that the incident x - ray is photoelectrically absorbed by the molecular gas that subtends an angle @xmath86 seen from the continuum source .",
