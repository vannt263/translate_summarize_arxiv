    "post - quantum theories have been proposed which provide explicit wave function collapse models to explain how the classical world emerges from the quantum domain , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "although the physics behind each collapse mechanism differs , they all operate as a spatial localization preventing massive objects to be in a quantum superposition of two or more positions . a possible approach to test them is to manipulate the motion of a mechanical oscillator through the radiation pressure . in this framework , it has been recently proposed to test collapse models by simply looking at the spectrum of the light driving the oscillator @xcite or through a spontaneous increase of the equilibrium temperature @xcite .",
    "alternatively , we can look for a method to push the mechanical oscillator down to the quantum regime where its spatial position is largely delocalized and a technique to record the decay of spatial quantum coherences . deviation from standard decoherence that occurs through the interaction with the environment @xcite might make it possible to confirm or rule out predictions from these hypothetic wave function collapse models .",
    "the proposals of refs @xcite have followed this approach .",
    "they consist of first preparing quantum light , entangling it with the mechanical oscillator position and subsequently observing the oscillator decoherence through the decay of quantum properties of light . while recent proposals have shown how to relax some of the constraints on the opto - mechanical coupling strength , they still need non - classical light to start with @xcite . in the resolved - sideband regime , techniques benefiting from an optomechanical squeezing interaction @xcite or based on conditioning @xcite have been put forward to create quantum optomechanical states while avoiding the initial preparation of non - classical light .",
    "+ in this work , we use laser light to drive a mechanical oscillator in the pulsed regime where the light pulse duration is much shorter than the mechanical period . in this regime ,",
    "the mechanical oscillator can be cooled and manipulated without sideband resolution @xcite as shown in an recent experiment @xcite .",
    "the basic principle for manipulation is that the kick imparted by the light is proportional to the photon number . in particular , we show that when the oscillator is driven by an intense laser pulse where the photon number is inherently and largely undefined , this results in an opto - mechanical entangled state in which the oscillator is delocalized over a large range of positions . we build up an entanglement witness that can be used to reveal the quantum nature of this opto - mechanical state .",
    "we also show how to disentangle the light and the oscillator while using the light to record the decay of the oscillator spatial coherences and ultimately , to probe hypothetic deviations from standard decoherence .",
    "we discuss the experimental feasibility of this test bench for wave function collapse models by studying the effects of various measurement inaccuracies and finite cooling efficiencies .",
    "consider the optical and mechanical modes of an optomechanical cavity with bosonic operators @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the mechanical frequency and @xmath4 is the optomechanical coupling , l being the cavity length , m the effective mass of the oscillator and @xmath5 the cavity frequency .",
    "further consider the ideal case where the mechanical mode is initially prepared in its motional ground state @xmath6 when a @xmath7 photon fock state @xmath8 impinges upon the oscillator , they induce a displacement of the mechanical state whose amplitude is time dependent @xmath9 @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the result of the interaction with a laser pulse @xmath10 ( where we assume that @xmath11 all along the paper ) , i.e. with a poissonian distribution of number states can be obtained directly from this expression . in particular , in the pulsed regime where the interaction time @xmath12 satisfies @xmath13 ( cf below for the exact conditions ) the optomechanical state reduces to @xmath14 a time @xmath15 after the interaction .",
    "the mechanical state involves coherent states @xmath16 with amplitudes that depend on the photon number .",
    "right after the interaction @xmath17 the photon number is entangled with the mechanical momentum .",
    "then the mechanical oscillator rotates in phase space . after a quarter of a mechanical period @xmath18 the photon number",
    "is entangled with the mechanical position before being entangled again with the mechanical momentum at @xmath19 and so on . before we show how to reveal this optomechanical entanglement ,",
    "let us note that the mechanical position is delocalized over the range @xmath20 on average which can be made much larger than the mechanical zero - point fluctuation @xmath21 with an intense driving laser , even in the experimentally relevant regime where @xmath22 @xmath23 as the characteristic timescale of the wave - function collapse models decreases with @xmath24 some of them are expected to degrade the quantum properties of the state ( [ optomechanical_state ] ) on timescales that can be accessed experimentally even when dealing with small effective masses , as we show below .",
    "the question that we address in this paragraph is how to detect the quantum nature of the optomechanical state ( [ optomechanical_state ] ) .",
    "the entanglement witness that we propose is inspired by ref .",
    "@xcite . concretely , for two pairs of local observables",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 and a separable state @xmath27 , the following inequality holds @xmath28 \\rangle | + | \\langle [ b_1 ,   b_2 ] \\rangle |\\right ) $ ] where @xmath29 stands for the variance .",
    "the idea is that the observables satisfy the heisenberg uncertainty relation locally whereas the pairs of observables @xmath30 and @xmath31 can only be classically correlated for a separable state .",
    "the aim is thus to find two couples of observables @xmath32 and @xmath33 such that the variances @xmath34 do not increase ( decrease ) during the evolution while the commutators @xmath35 \\rangle|$ ] and @xmath36 \\rangle$ ] increase ( stay constant ) . in our case , the optomechanical interaction shifts the oscillator momentum by the photon number ( times the interaction strength ) suggesting @xmath37 and @xmath38 similarly , the light field acquires a phase proportional to the position of the oscillator .",
    "while the phase @xmath39 is not a physical observable , for a coherent state it can be indirectly accessed through homodyne detections @xmath40 therefore , we choose @xmath41 and @xmath42 this leads to the following inequality @xmath43 if the results of measurements do not fulfill this inequality , we can conclude that the light field and the mechanical oscillator are entangled .",
    "in particular , this inequality does not hold for the state ( [ optomechanical_state ] ) if @xmath44 this condition is obtained under the assumption @xmath45 it can be understood as a requirement on the laser intensity to significantly enlarge the mechanical zero point spread  a condition that is necessary to correlate the photon number and the mechanical momentum .",
    "+     interacts with the mechanical device , the photon number is entangled with the mechanical momentum . to detect this optomechanical entangled state , we need to look at the correlations between i ) the photon number and the mechanical momentum , ii ) the quadrature of the light and the mechanical position .",
    "the latter can be performed by using the fact that the phase shift in the reflected light is proportional to the position of the mirror . to record the mechanical decoherence , the mechanical oscillator is first disentangled from the light by measuring the mechanical position at a time which is a multiple of half the mechanical period ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "a feedback loop is then needed to correct the phase of the light depending on the result of the measurement of the mechanical position .",
    "the oscillator decoherence translates into a phase noise on the light that can be observed with an homodyne detection .",
    "deviation from environmental decoherence might make it possible to confirm or rule out predictions form explicit wave function collapse models.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]",
    "we first explain how to proceed with recording the decoherence of the mechanical oscillator :    * a short pulse of duration @xmath12 generates the entangled optomechanical state ( [ optomechanical_state ] ) . * after a variable delay @xmath46 , another short pulse is used to measure the mechanical position , where no information is revealed about the photon number . * the phase of the light pulse in ( a ) is shifted using the measurement outcome of step ( b ) . * the phase quadrature of the outgoing light is measured .    in the ideal case without decoherence ,",
    "the conditional state of the light @xmath47 has a phase which depends on the result @xmath48 of the measurement of the oscillator position . correcting the phase of the light with a feedback loop yields a photonic state that is identical to the initial light state @xmath49 .",
    "things are different if we take the oscillator decoherence into account .",
    "these decoherence models , conventional or otherwise , operate as a decay of spatial coherences @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are position eigenstates .",
    "the exact expression of @xmath53 will differ according to the decoherence model being described @xcite , but all operate as a spatial localisation as a function of the distance @xmath54 , resulting in a phase noise on the light once the position of the mechanical device is measured @xcite . instead of @xmath55 , in the presence of decoherence ,",
    "one obtains ( see @xcite , supplemental material )    @xmath56    where @xmath57 with @xmath58 indicating an average over half a period of the mechanical oscillator .",
    "the problem of identifying the oscillator decoherence is thus equivalent to characterizing a phase noise channel with light  this characterization is more accurate when probed with large photon numbers .",
    "for example , by measuring the quadrature @xmath59 of the light field , we get    @xmath60    and similarly @xmath61 where @xmath62 is defined by @xmath63 i.e. @xmath64 immediately after the optomechanical interaction ( k=0 ) , the mechanical oscillator has not yet undergone any decoherence and @xmath65 @xmath66 the phase of the light is well defined and the variance of @xmath55 is @xmath67 in the limit where @xmath68 the spatial coherences of the mechanical oscillator vanish @xmath69 @xmath70 .",
    "the light field is described by a mixture of coherent states with random phases and its spread in the phase space tends to @xmath71 focusing on @xmath72 the time taken to double the distribution of possible results , for example , is given by @xmath73 at the leading order in @xmath74 .",
    "we see that the use of intense laser pulses reduces the time it takes to observe the effect of collapse models . as particular examples ,",
    "we compare conventional decoherence with explicit collapse models as proposed by ellis and co - workers @xcite on the one hand and diosi & penrose @xcite on the other hand .",
    "we show that with a combination of large @xmath74 and small thermal dissipation , we can find experimentally feasible parameters in which the standard decoherence time is longer than the timescale of these collapse models , hence opening the way to confirm or rule out their predictions .",
    "note that for standard decoherence processes where @xmath75 @xmath76 . in this case",
    "@xmath77 for the diosi & penrose model , @xmath78 decreases less rapidly with @xmath79 such that the ratio @xmath80 can be much larger than one .",
    "as this ratio can be accessed through the two first moments of @xmath59 - , this provides an unambiguous criteria to distinguish standard decoherence with the dioisi & penrose model .",
    "this is particularly relevant in the regime where @xmath81 is comparable to the parameter that is used to define the mass distribution in the diosi & penrose model .",
    "we now address the question of the feasibility in detail .",
    "first , our results have been derived under the assumption that the dynamics falls within the pulsed regime .",
    "this requires @xmath82 which provides an upper bound on the photon number given the optomechanical coupling , the pulse duration and the mechanical frequency placing an upper limit on the extent to which we can violate ( [ ent_witness ] ) .",
    "let us now consider various imperfections .",
    "first , let the measurement of the oscillator position be subject to a gaussian noise with a spread @xmath83 to reveal entanglement , one needs @xmath84 in the limit @xmath85 i.e. to resolve the zero point spread . the requirement is more demanding for recording decoherence . if the mechanical position is not precisely measured , the phase of the light can not be accurately corrected leading to phase noise .",
    "this effect has to be smaller than the phase noise induced by decoherence . since we are interested in the regime where decoherence doubles the variance of @xmath86 we need    @xmath87    note that the mechanical position can be measured by homodyning a light pulse that has been sent into the mechanics , since the phase of the reflected light pulse depends on the mechanical position .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that for an input drive with duration @xmath88 the achievable precision @xmath89 depends on the photon number @xmath90 through the formula @xmath91 the limitation for @xmath90 and hence on the precision is given by the power @xmath92 that can be used before heating significantly the surrounding bath and ultimately by the power that can be homodyned before photo - detection saturates .    similarly to the requirement on the precision of the measurement of the oscillator position , the measurement of the quadrature of the light field needs to be accurate .",
    "consider an imperfect quadrature measurement in which the phase of the local oscillator follows a gaussian distribution with a standard deviation @xmath93 this is equivalent to a phase noise on the light field and a perfect local oscillator .",
    "we found that the proposed witness can reveal optomechanical entanglement if @xmath94 to accurately record the decoherence of the mechanics , we find @xmath95 in the limit @xmath96 ( [ condition_violation ] ) , the constraint for observing entanglement is the most demanding .    if the mechanical oscillator is not initially in its ground state , but in a thermal state with a mean occupation @xmath97 the variance of the light is unchanged but the correlations between the light and mechanics decreases . to detect entanglement",
    ", one needs @xmath98 in the limit where @xmath99 various cooling schemes have been proposed in the pulsed regime @xcite .",
    "for example , it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that measuring the mechanical position with two pulses ( of duration @xmath100 and containing each @xmath90 photons ) delayed by a quarter of a mechanical period reduces the mechanical excitation to an effective thermal occupation @xmath101 for @xmath102 this results in @xmath103 i.e. ground state cooling . again",
    ", the limitation on @xmath104 is the power @xmath105 than can be homodyned and that can be undergone by the mechanics without increasing the temperature of the environment .    to summarize , let us consider a given optomechanical system with fixed mechanical and cavity frequencies , effective mass and cavity length , i.e. @xmath106 and @xmath3 are given .",
    "we choose a pulse duration @xmath12 as large as possible to relax the constraint on the precision of the homodyne detection ( [ accuracy_homodyne_ent ] ) .",
    "in particular , for @xmath107 the maximum value is set by the cavity finesse . we then choose the largest possible @xmath74 so that the dynamics still holds in the pulsed regime ( [ condition_linear ] ) .",
    "we found that @xmath108 provides a significant violation of the inequality ( [ ent_witness ] ) .",
    "the detection of entanglement then gives a constraint on the initial effective occupation number of the optomechanical system through the formula ( [ cond_occupation ] ) .",
    "lastly , the formulas ( [ accuracy_position_deco ] ) and ( [ accuracy_homodyne_ent ] ) give the requirement on the measurement precision .",
    "the temperature of the environment and the mechanical quality factor are such that standard decoherence should operate on times scales longer than the collapse models we wish to test .",
    "for concreteness , we focus on a mechanical oscillator with an effective mass @xmath109 ng and a frequency @xmath110 s@xmath111 that is used as one of the mirrors of a perot - fabry cavity with length 0.5 cm , resulting in an optomechanical coupling @xmath112 s@xmath113 we consider a cavity finesse of @xmath114 which corresponds to the finesse of the perot - fabry cavity implemented with micromirrors in ref . @xcite .",
    "this leads to light pulses with a duration @xmath115 @xmath116s with a mean photon number of up to @xmath117 i.e. a power is 1 @xmath116w . to reveal entanglement",
