    "@xmath1 scuti stars are pulsating a - type or f - type stars with mass @xmath4 that lie in the classical cepheid instability strip .",
    "they are usually on or near the main sequence ( luminosity class v - iii ; guzik 1997 ) , and they pulsate radially , as well as non - radially in pressure ( p ) and sometimes gravity ( g ) modes .",
    "the pulsation instability is driven by opacity changes related primarily to the second ionization of he ( @xmath5-mechanism ; gautschy & saio 1996 ) .",
    "the photometric oscillations of the high - amplitude @xmath1 scuti stars ( hads ) , which are defined as those with @xmath6 mag @xcite , are generally dominated by the radial fundamental mode .",
    "in contrast , the variations seen in the lower - amplitude @xmath1 scuti stars consist of multiple non - radial and radial p- ( and g- ) mode oscillations .",
    "most @xmath1 scuti stars are population i objects , some of which show chemical peculiarities ( rodrguez & breger 2001 ; morgan & abt 1972 ) .    in the course of a search for rapid optical variations in symbiotic binary stars , sokoloski , bildsten , & ho ( 2001 ; hereafter sbh ) observed 131 stars in the fields of 35 symbiotic stars , primarily in the northern hemisphere .",
    "we describe here the serendipitous discovery of variability in 4 of these stars , referred to as sbcf 1 - 4 .",
    "one new variable object , sbcf 1 , is quite clearly a @xmath1 scuti star , and given their oscillation periods and colors , the three others are probably @xmath1 scuti stars as well .",
    "a fifth star from the sample , sao 31628 , was found to be an eclipsing binary , and the observations and ephemeris for this system are presented in @xcite .",
    "sbcf 1 has a 0.0198-d pulsation period , which is shorter than all but 3 of the 636 @xmath1 scuti stars ( with periods ranging from 0.0156 to 0.2878 d ) listed in the catalogue of @xcite .",
    "very rapidly pulsating main - sequence @xmath1 scuti stars , such as this one , can potentially be useful targets for study and mode identification , since good frequency coverage can be obtained with a smaller temporal baseline than for the more slowly pulsating systems .",
    "analysis of the pulsation frequencies of @xmath1 scuti stars provides an opportunity to test models of stellar structure and evolution , estimate the ages of stars , and determine the distances to stars through the use of a period - luminosity(-color - metallicity ) relationship . to perform this asteroseismology ,",
    "however , it is necessary to identify the oscillation modes ( i.e. , the spherical harmonic degree @xmath7 , the azimuthal order @xmath8 , the radial degree ( overtone ) @xmath9 or @xmath10 , and whether the mode is a p mode , g mode , or mixed ) .",
    "a new generation of survey experiments are being planned or are under way that are geared specifically to the broad study of variable stars or asteroseismology , such as the gaia space mission ( perryman et al .",
    "2001 ) , stare ( stellar astrophysics & research on exoplanets ; brown & kolinski 1999 ) , rotse ( the robotic optical transient search experiment ; see akerlof et al .",
    "2000 ) , asas ( the all sky automated survey ; pojmaski 2000 ) , the hungarian automated telescope ( bakos 2001 ) , the faint sky variability survey ( groot et al . 1999 ) , the panoramic optical imager project ( poi ; kaiser et al . 2002 ) , and eventually the large - aperture synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ; tyson & angel 2001 ) . large numbers of new @xmath1 scuti variables are expected to be found as a result of these projects @xcite .",
    "estimates , however , are often based upon previous large surveys , such as hipparcos , that are not sensitive to short - period pulsations , so there is much uncertainty in these predictions for new @xmath1 scuti stars .",
    "although our survey was very small compared to hipparcos , we were sensitive to shorter - period pulsations , and so this work provides a glimpse of the variability fraction of short - period variable stars outside of open clusters ( where most previous small surveys with similar sensitivity have been done ) .",
    "we briefly describe our survey in  [ sec : observations ] .",
    "the observations and results for the individual new variable stars are presented in  [ sec : sbcf1 ] through  [ sec : sbcf4 ] , and we discuss our conclusions in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "between 1997 and 1999 , we performed a variability survey at uco / lick observatory , with the 1-m nickel telescope , in order to search for rapid variations in symbiotic binary stars .",
    "details of these observations and the aperture photometry can be found in sbh . we were sensitive to oscillations with periods in the range of a few minutes to several hours , and",
    "amplitudes down to a few mmag . only stars with @xmath11 mag",
    "were considered .",
    "the periods for the pulsating variable stars discovered in this way range from approximately 0.02 to 0.1 d , and the full @xmath12-band oscillation amplitudes ranged from 10 to 75 mmag .",
    "on 2001 november 18 ( ut is used throughout this paper ) , to follow up on one of the variable star discoveries , we obtained a moderate - resolution spectrum of sbcf 1 using the echellette spectrograph and imager ( esi ; sheinis et al .",
    "2000 ) on the 10-m keck ii telescope .",
    "a single 300-s exposure in good conditions with a 1@xmath13 slit gave a spectral resolution of @xmath14 km s@xmath15 over the range 3950 - 10400   . in order to get better spectral coverage in the near - ultraviolet , we re - observed the object on 2002 january 18 for 300 s with the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; oke et al . 1995 ) mounted on the 10-m keck i telescope .",
    "the @xmath16 slit provided a resolution of 3.3   over a wavelength range of 3350 - 5380   on the blue arm of the spectrograph and 2.0   over 5700 - 7000   on the red arm .",
    "the slit was aligned with the parallactic angle to minimize the effects of atmospheric dispersion @xcite for both observations .",
    "each two - dimensional exposure was processed using the standard ccd reduction packages in iraf .",
    "flux calibration and removal of telluric absorption features @xcite were accomplished in idl using our own tasks ( matheson et al .",
    "the individual esi orders were reduced separately and then rebinned to a common wavelength scale before being added together .",

    "in the field of the symbiotic system ax persei , we found an oscillating star with a dominant period of 0.0198 d , and a total peak - to - peak amplitude of 35 mmag .",
    "this star does not have an sao or hd number ( in the usno - a2.0 catalogue , it is designated 1425 - 02166463 ) , so we shall follow a recommendation from the iau ( l. dickel , private communication ) and refer to it as sbcf 1 .",
    "it is roughly 0.8 mag fainter than ax per ( in quiescence ) in both of our observations . from @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath12 magnitude of ax per in quiescence is 13.0 , so the @xmath12 magnitude of sbcf 1 is approximately 13.8 ( see table [ tab : tbl-1 ] for the average magnitudes of the new variable stars ) .",
    "there is no object in the simbad database at this position .",
    "the finder charts for this and the other new @xmath1 scuti stars are shown in figure [ fig : charts ] , and the coordinates of all objects are listed in table [ tab : tbl-1 ] .",
    "we show the light curves from our two observations of sbcf 1 in figure [ fig : sbcf1lcs ] . the first observation , on 1998 january 23 ,",
    "was done under cloudy conditions .",
    "consequently , the light curve from this night has data gaps and is of generally poor quality . during the second observation , however , on 1998 septempber 15 , the conditions were good , and the signal is clear . furthermore , the 1998 september 15 observation was performed with a more sensitive ccd , and so we were able to obtain higher temporal resolution .",
    "the light curve from this date reveals that the oscillation amplitude is variable , and that the object is therefore multi - periodic .",
    "in fact , at least two oscillation periods can be identified using the phase dispersion minimization method ( stellingwerf 1978 ) , one at @xmath23 d , and another at @xmath24 d. the 0.0198-d oscillation has an amplitude of 24 mmag , as determined by folding the light curve with that period , and the 0.0265-d oscillation has a smaller amplitude of roughly 10 mmag peak - to - peak , using the same folding method . both oscillations have near - sinusoidal profiles . folding the light curve from january , and again using the phase dispersion minimization method , we recover an oscillation with period @xmath25 d , consistent with the stronger of the two oscillations detected in 1998 september .",
    "the parameters for sbcf 1 and the other new variable stars are listed in table [ tab : tbl-2 ] .",
    "the spectrum of sbcf 1 is shown in figure [ fig : sbcf1spec ] .",
    "the strong balmer series and lack of he lines indicate that this is an a - type star . the strength of the caii k @xmath263934 feature , the balmer line equivalent widths , and visual comparison of the metallic lines with spectral standards in the online digital spectral atlas of r. o. gray ( http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu",
    "/level5/gray / frames.html ) all indicate spectral type a2 .",
    "sbcf 1 is therefore a very short period @xmath1 scuti star .",
    "in fact , the dominant period of 0.0198 d is shorter than that of any of the 192 @xmath1 scuti stars listed in the catalog of @xcite , and all but 3 of 636 the stars listed in the catalog of @xcite .",

    "( 1975 ) , we find @xmath34 km s@xmath15 .",
    "the balmer - line profiles indicate that the star is not significantly evolved .",
    "the small oi @xmath267774 equivalent width of 0.70.8  confirms that sbcf 1 is a main - sequence star ( jaschek & jaschek 1987 ) , and the spectral type is thus a2v .",
    "v is in fact expected , since @xmath1 scuti stars with low amplitudes and short periods are generally not evolved ( rodrguez & breger 2001 ) .",
    "furthermore , the measured value of @xmath35 for sbcf 1 is very close to the average value for early a main - sequence stars ( jaschek & jaschek 1987 ) . from the schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) dust map ,",
    "the reddening toward sbcf 1 is @xmath36 mag .",
    "taking the absolute magnitude @xmath37 mag for an a2 main - sequence star ( schmidt - kaler 1982 ) , @xmath38 mag , and the measured apparent magnitude , we find that sbcf 1 is roughly 2 kpc away .",
    "this distance estimate justifies the assumption that sbcf 1 is behind the full column of extinction , given its galactic latitude of @xmath39 .    for a spectral type a2v",
    ", we can estimate the pulsation constant @xmath40 ( where @xmath41 is the pulsation period , @xmath42 is the stellar radius , and @xmath43 is the stellar mass ; christensen - dalsgaard 1993 ) . using the expression @xmath44 ( where @xmath45 is the pulsation frequency in cycles / day",
    ", @xmath46 is the bolometric magnitude , and @xmath47 is the effective temperature ; breger & bregman 1975 ) , and taking @xmath48 = 4.2 $ ] , @xmath49 mag , and @xmath50 ( schmidt - kaler 1982 ) , we find @xmath51 for the 0.0198-d oscillation , and @xmath52 for the 0.0265-d oscillation .",
    "these values are obviously only approximate , since @xmath53 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 are all very uncertain , but they are nonetheless interesting .",
    "@xmath54 is low and therefore suggests high - degree non - radial or high - order radial oscillations .",
    "non - radial oscillations with high @xmath7 value are not expected to have the relatively large amplitude that we observe ( balona & dziembowski 1999 ) , so the oscillations are probably high - overtone radial pulsators .",
    "high - overtone , low spherical harmonic degree pulsations ( e.g. , @xmath55 or @xmath56 ) are also a possibility ( j. guzik , private communication ) .",
    "koen et al .",
    "( 1999 ) presented a similar argument for high - order radial oscillations in another very short period @xmath1 scuti star , hd 23194 ( @xmath57 = 0.0204 d ) .",
    "contained in the field of the symbiotic star bf cygni is the star sbcf 2 (= gsc 02137 - 00847 = tyc 2137 847 1 ) .",
    "there is no indication from the simbad database that this star is variable , but a quick look at the three light curves in figure [ fig : sbcf2lcs ] reveals very significant oscillations .",
    "the variations are not simply repeatable , as we would expect for a binary , so they are likely due to stellar pulsation . > from the light curves , it is also apparent that more than one pulsation mode is present , and that the peak - to - peak amplitude in @xmath12 can reach more than 70 mmag .",
    "the first light curve , from 1997 apr 6 , can be fit with a sine curve with period 0.064 d and peak - to - peak amplitude of 74 mmag .",
    "the second and third light curves , from 1997 jul 11 and 1998 jul 1 , each require two sine components . from the 1997 jul 11 observation",
    ", we find sinusoidal oscillations with @xmath58 d ( 55 mmag peak - to - peak ) and @xmath59 d ( 32 mmag peak - to - peak ) , but since the 0.012-d period is close to the length of the latter observation , we consider the detection marginal .",
    "we fit the longest light curve , from 1998 july 1 , with a double sine wave , and find periods of 0.094 d ( 35 mmag peak - to - peak ) and 0.060 d ( 36 mmag peak - to - peak ) .",
    "given the uncertainty in the measured periods , it is possible that the 0.064-d oscillation on that day is consistent with the 0.06-d oscillations detected on the other nights .",
    "longer observations are clearly needed to determine the number of modes present in this star , although it is clear that there are at least two . according to the general catalogue of variable stars ( kholopov et al .",
    "1992 ) , pulsating variable stars with periods in this vicinity include @xmath1 scuti stars , with periods in the range 0.01 to 0.2 d ( rodrguez et al .",
    "2000 put the upper limit at @xmath60 d , and list the shortest period as 0.0156 d ) , and the sx phe stars .",
    "the sx phe stars , however , generally have amplitudes greater than 0.25 mag ( mcnamara 1997 ) , so sbcf 2 is unlikely to fall in this category .    from the tycho-2 main catalogue @xcite , the magnitudes for this object are @xmath61 mag and @xmath62 mag .",
    "converting these values to the johnson system ( using the expressions from the tycho catalogue description ) , we find @xmath63 mag , @xmath64 mag , and thus @xmath65 mag .",
    "the reddening from @xcite at the position of sbcf 2 is @xmath66 mag , so for this star , @xmath67 mag .",
    "this range of @xmath68 corresponds to an a- or f - type star , which is exactly what we expect for a @xmath1 scuti pulsator .",
    "therefore , given the oscillation period , light - curve shape , intrinsic color @xmath68 , and pulsation amplitude ( which ranges from 3 mmag to 0.9 mag in @xmath69 for @xmath1 scuti stars ) , we conclude that sbcf 2 is a @xmath1 scuti star . using absolute magnitudes and extinctions corresponding to spectral types within the allowed range ,",
    "the calculated distance to sbcf 2 is at least 250 pc .",
    "in the field of the symbiotic star as 360 (= qw sge ) , the star sbcf 3 (= gsc 01619 - 02513 ) oscillated with a peak - to - peak @xmath12-band amplitude of 30 mmag , and a period of 2.1 hr .",
    "we show the light curve for this star in figure [ fig : sbcf3lc ] .",
    "there is no object in the simbad database at this position . in the usno - a2.0 catalog , the @xmath12 magnitude of this star ( usno - a2.0 1050 - 14753932 )",
    "is listed as 12.8 , and the @xmath42 magnitude as 12.4 , giving a color for sbcf 3 of @xmath70 mag .",
    "the intrinsic color for sbcf 3 is therefore @xmath71 mag ; if it is a main - sequence star , sbcf 3 must therefore be spectral type a or earlier .",
    "since an a - type star has a radius roughly two or more times that of the sun , such a star can not fit within the roche lobe of a binary with either a 2-hr or 4-hr orbital period ( the orbital period of an ellipsoidal variable would be twice the photometric period ) . to fit within the roche lobe of a 2-hr binary , a star would need @xmath72 . the oscillation period of 2.1 hr and the restriction on the spectral type indicate that sbcf 3 is likely to be a @xmath1 scuti star .",
    "sbcf 4 (= gsc 03645 - 01592 = tyc 3645 1592 1 ) is the only star within @xmath73 of z and whose brightness is within 2 or even 3 mag of z and . in the tycho catalogue ,",
    "photometry for gsc 03645 - 01592 is given as @xmath74 mag and @xmath75 mag .",
    "converting to johnson magnitudes , we find @xmath76 and @xmath77 mag . because of the interesting 28-minute oscillation in z and ( sokoloski & bildsten 1999 ) , we observed this field many times . the paucity of suitable comparison stars , however , made high - quality light curves difficult to produce .",
    "an example , which was constructed using an ensemble average of 2 very faint comparison stars , is shown in figure [ fig : sbcf4lc ] .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio is lower than for the other light curves , but variability at the level of about 40 mmag peak - to - peak is evident .",
    "the variability amplitude of this star was not constant from observation to observation ( i.e. , month to month ) , and on at least one occasion , the variations were undetectable .",
    "when variations were present , the oscillation period for sbcf 4 was roughly 2 hr . with an intrinsic color @xmath78 mag , the spectral type of this star must be f0 or earlier .",
    "as with sbcf 3 , a star with such an early spectral type could not fit within the roche lobe of a binary with the observed ( or twice the observed ) period .",
    "therefore , with an a- or early - f - type spectrum , and an oscillation period of 2 hr , this star is an excellent candidate @xmath1 scuti star .",
    "we analyzed light curves for 131 stars with @xmath12 magnitude less than 14 , that had a typical temporal resolution of 1 minute or shorter .",
    "out of these objects , we found four new pulsating variable stars .",
    "the short - period @xmath1 scuti star sbcf 1 is potentially a good candidate for further study , since mode identification might be accomplished with less observing time than for the longer period @xmath1 scuti stars .",
    "sbcf 1 is not as bright as some of the other @xmath1 scutis that have been targets for serious asteroseismological efforts , but with the availability of larger telescopes and more sensitive ccds , the opportunity to use a shorter temporal baseline , and therefore less complex window function , becomes increasingly important .",
    "for example , using differential ccd photometry and a 1-m telescope , we were able to obtain the same level of photometric precision ( several mmag per point ) for sbcf 1 as viskum et al .",
    "( 1998 ) had in their study of fg vir that resulted in the identification of eight oscillation modes of that star .",
    "in addition , unevolved , core h - burning @xmath1 scuti stars have pulsation spectra that are theoretically predicted to be less dense than shell h - burning , evolved @xmath1 scuti stars ( michel et al .",
    "asteroseismological studies of this object could thus help achieve broad goals such as testing theories of stellar structure and evolution , and extending the period - luminosity relation to low - amplitude pulsating stars ( petersen & christensen - dalsgaard 1999 ) .",
    "nearly all currently known @xmath1 scuti stars with oscillation amplitudes below 20 mmag or periods below 0.05 d have been found by individual observers or small collaborations ( rodrguez & breger 2001 ) .",
    "therefore , in contrast to the longer period variables that are easily detected by , for example , hipparcos , macho , and ogle , very little statistical information is currently available about the prevalence of stellar variability in this parameter range .",
    "in fact , the studies which heretofore have been most sensitive to rapid , low - amplitude oscillations have primarily examined stars in open clusters , where the detection rate is a function of cluster age scutis at all were found out of 68 stars in the instability strip in ngc 7226 ( viskum et al .",
    "( since a different amount of the isochrone will pass through the instability strip for different ages ) . therefore , small surveys such as this one , with the ability to detect variations on time scales as short as a few minutes , can provide information that , when considered with large survey results , should improve the predictions of the number of variable stars that will be found with the new generation of searches .",
    "our discovery rate for low - amplitude pulsators of 3% is higher than the rates that were found with hipparcos ( 1% ; eyer 1999 ) , ogle ( 0.04 - 0.08% ; udalski et al . 1994 , 1995a , b ; eyer 1999 ) , or macho ( @xmath79 0.032% ; cook 1997 ) .",
    "the difference between these results could be due to the small - number statistics for our survey , or to our better sensitivity in the more highly populated @xmath1 scuti period and amplitude parameter ranges .",
    "the number of @xmath1 scuti stars found with hipparcos dropped off below @xmath80 mmag @xcite , and the ogle and macho surveys are not sensitive to pulsations with amplitude less than 0.1 mag ( rodrguez et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the typical periods of @xmath1 scuti stars may be even more relevant for explaining our higher detection rate .",
    "the peak of the distribution of all @xmath1 scuti stars with period lies between 0.05 and 0.1 d , and more than 10% of known @xmath1 scuti stars have pulsation periods less than 0.05 d @xcite .",
    "we had excellent sensitivity to variables with periods in this range .",
    "hipparcos , on the other hand , because of its sampling , discovered very few @xmath1 scuti stars with pulsation period less than 0.1 day , and practically none with pulsation period less than 0.05 day .",
    "to put our results in the context of other surveys , asas looks for variables at a cadence of one day , and they have detected pulsating stars with periods only down to 0.13 d. the rotse all - sky survey found a firm lower limit of 0.2% for the variability fraction in the first analysis of part of their survey , but they are insensitive to oscillations with amplitude less than 0.1 mag ( in addition to some period limitations from obtaining data points only twice per day ; akerlof et al .",

    "<S> in a photometric variability survey of 131 stars with @xmath0 mag , we have found four new @xmath1 scuti stars . </S>",
    "<S> we were sensitive to oscillation amplitudes as low as a few mmag . </S>",
    "<S> the detection rate of short - period ( @xmath2 d ) pulsating variable stars , which may be relevant for planned large variability surveys such as gaia , poi , and even the lsst , was therefore @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> all four new variable stars have low pulsation amplitude ( tens of mmag ) , and one has a very short period ( 0.0198 d ) . </S>",
    "<S> this star is one of the fastest known @xmath1 scuti pulsators . </S>",
    "<S> the short period of this variable star makes it observationally tractable , and it may therefore be a particularly good candidate for asteroseismological studies . </S>",
    "<S> all four new variable stars will add to the cadre of low - amplitude and relatively short - period @xmath1 scuti stars that are potentially useful for learning about the structure of stars on or near the main sequence , slightly more massive than the sun .    </S>",
