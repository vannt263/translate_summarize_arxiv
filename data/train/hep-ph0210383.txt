    "the problem of how a charm - quark fragments into a charmed hadron is challenging both from the theoretical and the experimental point of view .",
    "indeed , perturbative qcd is not applicable at energies comparable with the charm - quark mass .",
    "therefore , parameterizations have to be used and the parameters are determined experimentally . in the experiments",
    "the direct identification of the charmed hadron in the final state is only possible through the visual observation of the hadron decay and the measurement of the kinematical variables , practically feasible only with nuclear emulsions .    in the following ,",
    "we focus on the so - called charm - production fractions ( @xmath4 s ) ; i.e.  the probability that a charm - quark fragments into a charmed hadron @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "in this paper we review all existing data on charm - production fractions as measured by @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 experiments and predict @xmath4 in neutrino induced charm - production .",
    "indeed , data on charmed fractions in interactions induced by neutrinos are rather scarce . only one experiment , e531  @xcite , measured @xmath4 with a statistics of 122 events with an identified charmed hadron in the final state .    after a thorough overview of all available data , we present a method to extract @xmath4 for neutrino experiments .",
    "the major difference of this method with respect to other presented in the past , i.e.  see ref .",
    "@xcite , is that@xmath4 s from @xmath0 are not extrapolated to neutrino experiments straightway , but some peculiarities of @xmath7-induced interactions are accounted for . indeed , neutrinos may undergo to quasi - elastic and diffractive processes with production of charmed hadrons in the final state .",
    "these results are also used to estimate the semi - muonic branching ration of charmed hadrons .",
    "finally , we discuss the statistical and systematic uncertainties associated with our predictions and compare them with the e531 results .",
    "in this section we give an overview of the available data on @xmath8 measurements in @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath9 and @xmath2 experiments .",
    "furthermore , we also study the correlated variable @xmath10 , which is defined as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 signify vector and pseudo - scalar charmed mesons , respectively . when needed , we recomputed @xmath10 by using the latest charmed - hadron branching - ratios ( br ) .",
    "finally , we extract for the first time @xmath10 from neutrino induced charm - production data .    in the following",
    "we assume that @xmath14 and @xmath15 production cross - sections are equal at the parton level , as well as the direct production of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .    from here on ,",
    "we indicate with @xmath18 the sum of both prompt and decayed ( @xmath19 ) @xmath18 meson production .    under the previous assumptions ,",
    "the measurement of @xmath8 and @xmath20 ratios allows us to extract @xmath10 . by using the formulae given in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath10 can be extracted from the relations    @xmath21    @xmath22    where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "the basic principle to reconstruct @xmath0 events with charmed hadrons in the final state is common to all the experiments .",
    "being a @xmath26 pair produced in the annihilation , one charmed hadron is used to tag the events , while the other one to study the decay properties .",
    "the decay modes used to tag the event are   we implicitly indicate also the charge conjugated decay modes . ]",
    "@xmath27    @xmath28    @xmath29    @xmath30    where the corresponding branching ratios are also given in brackets  @xcite .",
    "results on the total cross - sections for inclusive production of the charmed particles @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 at various @xmath31 are shown in table  [ e+e - low ] .    .measured cross - sections for the production of charmed hadrons at center of mass energies ( @xmath31 ) in the range @xmath32  gev .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table  [ tab : dimuon ] we derived , by using the @xmath33 value obtained by imposing the unitarity constraint to the ckm matrix and the measurements of @xmath34 from various experiments , @xmath3 .",
    "given the fact that the different experiments exploit different neutrino energy spectra , we can probe the sensitivity of @xmath3 to the neutrino energy .",
    "as expected , the higher the neutrino beam energy the larger the value of @xmath3 .",
    "we have presented a method to extract the charmed fractions in neutrino induced events .",
    "the method relies on the fact that , apart from processes peculiar to neutrinos such as quasi - elastic and diffractive charm - production , the charm - production and fragmentation mechanism is believed to be process - independent .",
    "we have verified this natural assumption going through a complete review of the available data from different experiments . moreover , the @xmath17 over @xmath16 ratio is constant over the large energy range spanned by the collider and fixed target experiments reviewed in this paper . by using recent data from neutrino experiments ,",
    "we have assessed the consistency of this ratio with the one predicted by other experiments . on the other side ,",
    "the energy - independent behavior of the ratio itself is clear from the review of the experiments .",
    "threshold effects for the @xmath35 production are seen and accounted for . by introducing the diffractive charm - production and using the unity constraint , we have predicted the charm fragmentation as a function of the neutrino energy in the range useful to present neutrino experiments . in particular , a prediction for the chorus experiment has been made .",
    "the determination of the fragmentation function also allows the prediction of the semi - muonic branching ratio of charmed hadrons .",
    "the prediction given is in good agreement with a recent measurement made by the chorus experiment .",
