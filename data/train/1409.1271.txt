    "after decades of observational and theoretical efforts , the question of the origin of ultrahigh - energy cosmic - rays ( uhecrs ) still remains unanswered .",
    "in particular , the nature of their sources and the acceleration mechanism responsible for their colossal energies are unknown .    in the recent years , the pierre auger observatory ( auger ) as well as the high resolution fly s eye ( hires ) and the telescope array ( ta ) experiments have provided measurements with unprecedented statistics and resolution in the highest energy range of the cosmic - ray spectrum , above @xmath2 ev .",
    "measurements of the all sky uhecr spectrum have shown the presence of a feature above @xmath3ev compatible with the so - called greisen , zatsepin and kuzmin ( gzk ) cut - off , signature of the interaction of protons or heavier nuclei with extragalactic photon backgrounds . moreover , a first hint of an anisotropy signal at energies larger that @xmath4 eev has been reported by auger .",
    "although currently weaker than what has been anticipated after the first communication , this signal might give a hint of the overall correlation between uhecrs and nearby extragalactic matter .",
    "from the point of view of the composition of uhecrs , auger data suggest a rather radical transition from a relatively light composition around the ankle of the cosmic - ray spectrum ( about @xmath5 ev ) to a heavier composition above a few tens of eev ev .",
    "they are furthermore observing a different portion of the sky . ] .",
    "although the spectrum and anisotropy measurements favor extragalactic scenari for the origin of uhecrs , these observations are not constraining enough to reveal the nature of their sources . on the other hand ,",
    "the composition trend suggested by auger can , in principle , be understood if complex nuclei are accelerated at energies larger than protons .",
    "in particular , in a scenario where the maximum energy reached by protons would be lower than the the gzk energy scale , nuclei accelerated up to the same maximum rigidity would reach energies @xmath6 times higher ( where @xmath6 is the charge of a given nucleus ) which would result in a transition toward a gradually heavier uhecr composition . this composition trend , if further supported by higher statistics measurements , would be quite constraining for the acceleration mechanism and the source environment",
    ". the above - mentioned scenario could only hold if ( _ i _ ) complex nuclei are abundant in the composition at the source and ( _ ii _ ) the energy loss rate within the acceleration site is sufficiently low for nuclei to be accelerated at energies larger than protons and escape from the source .",
    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are among the best candidate sources for uhecrs .",
    "their very luminous prompt and afterglow emissions are thought to be related to the ejection of an ultrarelativistic outflow consecutive to the core collapse of a very massive star ( long burst ) or the merging of two compact objects ( short burst ) .",
    "the fluctuations of the central engine lead to the formation of internal shocks in which much of the jet power is dissipated . above the photosphere ,",
    "those shocks become collisionless and provide sites for particle acceleration .",
    "another dissipation and possible acceleration sites are the so - called external shock occuring when the jet encounters the dense interstellar medium ( vietri 1995 ; see however gallant and achterberg 1999 ) . among the popular scenarios invoked to explain the grbs prompt emission spectral and temporal properties , the internal shock model ( rees & mszros 1993 ) has been the most extensively discussed .",
    "the internal shock model relies on the presence of short time scale variability of the lorentz factor within the relativistic plasma outflow emitted by the central engine .",
    "mildly relativistic shocks are expected to form once the fast layers of plasma catch up with the slower parts , and to accelerate electrons whose subsequent cooling triggers the prompt emission .",
    "shortly after this scenario was proposed to account for grbs prompt emission , internal shocks also appeared as credible potential candidates for the acceleration of uhecrs .",
    "this possibility was first proposed by waxman ( 1995 ) whose line of reasoning was based on the observation that ( _ i _ ) internal shocks physical parameters were likely to fulfill the `` hillas criterion '' ( hillas 1984 ) for cosmic - rays acceleration above @xmath1 ev and ( _ ii _ ) that the grb emissivity in gamma - rays during the prompt phase was of the same order as the emissivity required for uhecr sources above @xmath2 ev . although the latter argument has become quite controversial in the past few years ( see for instance berezinsky et al .",
    ", 2006 ) , the study of protons acceleration at grb internal shocks has been the purpose of many studies since waxman s pioneering work ( milgrom & usov 1995 ; bttcher & dermer 1998 ; waxman & bahcall 2000 ; dermer & humi 2001 ; gialis & pelletier 2003a , 2003b , 2005 ) . among them , some were dedicated to the possible contribution of galactic grbs to cosmic - rays at knee and above energies ( atoyan & dermer 2006 ) or more recently to uhecrs ( calvez et al .",
    "2010 ) . the specific case of ultra - high energy ( above @xmath7 ev ) nuclei acceleration was considered in fewer studies ( wang et al .",
    "2008 ; murase et al .",
    "2008 ; metzger et al .",
    "2011 ) the latter also considering the possibility of heavy nuclei nucleosynthesis within grbs relativistic outflows . the important question of nuclei survival during the early phase of grbs ( and its dependence on the physical processes at play during this phase )",
    "was recently discussed by horiuchi et al .",
    "the production of very high energy secondary particles , natural aftermath and possible signature of cosmic - ray acceleration to the highest energies has also been extensively studied .",

    "we then discuss the relevant energy loss processes at play during cosmic - ray acceleration at internal shocks and calculate the corresponding energy loss times , in sect .",
    "the comparison between the expected acceleration time and loss time allows us to give a first estimate of the maximum energy reachable by cosmic - rays protons or nuclei . in sect .  5",
    ", we describe our monte - carlo calculation in which the energy loss mechanisms and internal shocks physical conditions derived from sect .  2",
    "are included to the numerical modeling of particle acceleration .",
    "we calculate cosmic - ray spectra at the source , for different grb luminosities , as well as secondary particles production .",
    "we then use the recent grb luminosity function and cosmological evolution derived by wanderman & piran ( 2010 ) to estimate the diffuse uhecr and neutrino fluxes expected for our models in sect .",
    "we finally discuss the physical parameter space ( especially the different cases of energy redistribution between electrons , cosmic - rays and the magnetic field ) that could allow grbs internal shocks to be the main source of uhecrs , summarize our results and conclude in sect .  7 .",
    "the origin of the prompt emission of grbs is still debated .",
    "their very large luminosity and the short time scale variability of the observed light curves constrain the emission to be produced within a relativistic jet of typical lorentz factor 100 - 1000 to avoid photon annihilation and the production of electron - positron pairs that would generate a large thomson optical depth ( piran 1999 ; lithwick & sari 2001 ; hascot et al .",
    "the acceleration of the relativistic outflow from the central engine ( an accreting stellar mass black hole or a magnetar ) can have either a thermal or magnetic origin . at some radius , a photosphere forms in the flow , its location , luminosity and temperature depending on the respective thermal and magnetic power injected at the base of the jet and on the amount of entrained baryonic matter ( daigne & mochkovitch 2002 ; hascot , daigne & mochkovitch 2013 ) .",
    "pure photospheric emission can not explain grb spectra , which are non - thermal , having the form of broken power - laws with respective spectral indices @xmath8 and @xmath9 at low and high energy .",
    "the average values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 are @xmath10 and @xmath11 with a typical break energy of a few hundreds kev ( kaneko et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "there are three leading models for creating the prompt emission of grbs : ( _ i _ ) sub - photospheric dissipation where various processes can modify the emerging initially thermal spectrum to produce the observed broken power - law ( rees & mszros 2005 ; peer , mszros & rees 2005 ; ryde et al .",
    "2011 ; beloborodov 2010 ; levinson 2012 ; beloborodov 2013 ; keren & levinson 2014 ) ; ( _ ii _ ) magnetic reconnection in a magnetized ejecta ( giannios 2012 ; mc kinney & uzdensky 2012 ; yuan & zhang 2012 ; zhang & zhang 2014 ) and ( _ iii _ ) internal shocks , which occur if the distribution of lorentz factor is variable in the outflow so that rapid parts can catch up and collide with slower ones ( rees & mszros 1994 ; kobayshi , piran & sari 1997 ; daigne & mochkovitch 1998 ) .",
    "detailed models of internal shocks have been constructed ( bosnjak & daigne 2014 ) and many of their predictions compare favourably to observations ( e.g. hardness duration , hardness intensity and hardness fluence correlations , width of pulses as a function of energy , etc ) .",
    "however there are also problems such as a low efficiency ( a few percents typically since only the fluctuations and not the bulk of the kinetic power is dissipated ) and a spectral shape that does not fit the data at low energy ( preece et al 1998 ; ghisellini et al .",
    "the predicted spectral slope @xmath12 , corresponding to synchrotron radiation in the so - called fast cooling regime , is too soft .",
    "some possibilities to produce a harder spectrum ( derishev 2007 ; daigne et al .",
    "2011 , uhm & zhang 2014 ) might account for @xmath8 values up to @xmath10 but reaching even larger values from @xmath10 to 0 appears quite challenging . also internal shock models require that the flow should be initially magnetically dominated because otherwise the thermal emission of the photosphere might be brighter than that of internal shocks ( daigne & mochkovitch 2002 ) and simultaneously that the ratio @xmath13 of the magnetic to kinetic energy in the flow should have decreased below 0.1 at the location of internal shocks to allow them to preserve the required efficiency ( mimica & aloy 2010 ; narayan et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "photospheric and reconnection models have been proposed as possible solutions to these problems .",
    "they are potentially more efficient than collisionless internal shocks . in photospheric models ,",
    "the basic radiation mechanism is not synchrotron ( but synchrotron emission is nevertheless involved in some cases , e.g. vurm et al .",
    "internal shocks , if they occur below the photosphere , are mediated by radiation .",
    "they can reproduce the observed grb spectra with @xmath8 values from @xmath10 to 0 ( levinson 2012 ; keren & levinson 2014 ) . however , they are unlikely to accelerate cosmic - rays by fermi processes because of their large transition layer .",
    "reconnection models appear natural if the flow remains magnetized at large distances from the source . for the moment ,",
    "these alternatives ( especially reconnection ) make much fewer predictions than internal shocks that can be compared to observations . as a result",
    ", they can not be tested as thoroughly and it is therefore difficult to draw too definite conclusions . in spite of this somewhat uncertain situation",
    "we believe it remains important to explore the ability of the ( collisionless ) internal shock scenario to account for the production of uhecrs .",
    "we use a simple model where the relativistic outflow emitted by the central engine is represented by a large number of shells that interact by direct collisions only ( daigne & mochkovitch 1998 ) .",
    "pressure waves are neglected but this is a reasonable approximation ( which has been confirmed by hydrodynamic calculations , see e.g. daigne & mochkovitch 2000 ) as kinetic energy largely dominates over internal energy in the flow .",
    "we prepare an initial set of 1000 shells separated by intervals @xmath14 ms in the source frame , corresponding to a total injection time @xmath15 s. the distribution of the lorentz factor in the flow is given by @xmath16\\ \\ \\",

    "with such a distribution , the rapid part of the flow ( @xmath18 ) will be decelerated by the relatively slower part ( @xmath19 ) placed ahead of it .",
    "two shocks are formed starting from the region where the initial gradient of lorentz factors is the largest , propagating respectively toward the front and the back of the flow . in our simple model , the propagation of these two shocks is discretized by a large number of elementary collisions between individual shells . with",
    "our adopted distribution of lorentz factors , the shock propagating toward the front of the flow is short lived ( we will not consider it in the following calculations ) while the other one becomes rapidly dominant and is responsible for the bulk of the dissipation and therefore for the prompt emission ( see daigne & mochkovitch 1998 and daigne & mochkovitch 2000 , for more details ) . as a result of energy dissipation throughout the propagation of the shock over large distances , one pulse lasting a few second",
    "will be obtained in the lightcurve , which is typical in long grbs .",
    "variability on a much shorter timescale ( down to a few milliseconds ) is indeed observed but most of the burst energy is generally carried by much longer pulses .",
    "the mass of each individual shell in the flow is obtained assuming a constant injected power @xmath20 so that @xmath21 we then follow the motion of the shells until a collision between two shells @xmath22 and @xmath23 occurs .",
    "we record the time @xmath24 and location @xmath25 ( both measured in the central source frame ) of the collision and compute the dissipated energy @xmath26 we estimate @xmath27 ( the lorentz factor of the shocked fluid resulting from the collision , as seen in the central source frame ) by considering that most of the energy available in the collision has been released when the less massive of the two shells has swept up a mass comparable to its own mass in the other layer .",
    "one then obtains @xmath28 it should be noticed that the dissipated energy represents only a small fraction of the total kinetic energy of the merging shells , around 15% for our assumed distribution of lorentz factors , as the collisions are only mildly relativistic with a relative velocity and lorentz factor given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the contrast of lorentz factor between two shells that collide at a radius @xmath25 ( leading for example to @xmath31 and @xmath32 for @xmath33 ) . in our simple model , @xmath34 and @xmath35",
    "also represent the velocity and lorentz factor of the shock in the undisturbed fluid rest frame , at a given time during its propagation , we call them hereafter respectively @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "+ the dissipated energy will be received by the observer starting at a time @xmath38 and will extend over a duration @xmath39 due to the curvature of the emitting shell .",
    "after each collision , we continue to follow the evolution of the system of shells until the next collision occurs .",
    "the calculation ends when the remaining shells are all ordered with the lorentz factor increasing outwards or , when only one shell remains . adding all the elementary contributions from these collisions",
    "finally gives the power received by the observer as a function of time as well as the dynamical evolution of all the important physical quantities during the shock propagation .",
    "our simple shell model mimics the hydrodynamics of the flow and provides , at any given time during the shock propagation , estimates of the post - shock density @xmath40 and the energy dissipated per unit mass @xmath41 in the comoving frame of the shocked material .",
    "the two quantities are estimated using the following relations : @xmath42 @xmath43 once the redistribution parameters of the dissipated energy @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( corresponding respectively to the fraction of the dissipated energy injected into accelerated cosmic - rays , accelerated electrons and the magnetic field ) have been fixed , it is then possible to obtain an estimate of the magnetic field in the shocked medium , @xmath47 moreover , assuming that the distribution of the shock - accelerated electrons is a power - law of index @xmath48 for @xmath49 one obtains @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the proton and electron masses and @xmath53 is the fraction of electrons which are accelerated .",
    "this equation can be solved numerically to estimate @xmath54 ( once @xmath55 is known , see below ) .",
    "let us note that eq .",
    "[ eq : gametrue ] reduces to the often used relation : @xmath56 in the limit @xmath57 and @xmath58 . +",
    "once the magnetic field and the minimum lorentz factor of the accelerated electrons are known the synchrotron energy , which is also the peak energy of the photon spectrum in the fast cooling regime , is readily obtained @xmath59 in practice , to reach typical @xmath60 values from a few kev to a few mev , small values of @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) are required ( see discussion in daigne & mochkovitch 1998 , and references therein ) .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss the physical relevance of such small values of @xmath61 , as the physics of mildly relativistic shocks ( say , @xmath63 ) has not been extensively explored by simulations ( see sect .  3 ) .",
    "cc      in the following , we will consider three models corresponding to three different combinations of the dissipated energy redistribution parameters .",
    "for all these models , we assume that the prompt emission is dominated by the photon emission consecutive to the cooling of accelerated electrons . for the first model , hereafter model a , we assume equipartition of the dissipated energy between the accelerated cosmic - rays , the accelerated electrons and the magnetic field , i.e @xmath64 .",
    "as mentioned above , @xmath65 of the wind energy is dissipated during internal collisions , for the lorentz factor distribution given in eq .",
    "[ eq : profil ] .",
    "this means that @xmath66 of the wind energy is communicated to accelerated electrons .",
    "the fast cooling of these electrons by synchrotron or inverse compton losses redistributes almost entirely this energy to the prompt emission photons which , then , ultimately represent @xmath67 of the energy initially injected in the relativistic wind , i.e the prompt emission luminosity @xmath68 . as a result , considering wind luminosities between @xmath69 and @xmath70 one gets prompt emission luminosities @xmath71 between @xmath72 and @xmath73 . by setting the fraction of accelerated electrons @xmath74 , the peak energy @xmath60 obtained lies between a few kev at low luminosities to @xmath75 for the largest luminosities .    for the two other models , hereafter models b and c , we make a very different assumption on the dissipated energy redistribution parameter for the accelerated electrons @xmath76 and , as a consequence , on the efficiency of the prompt emission .",
    "we assume that the prompt emission efficiency is lower than in the case of model a and goes from approximately 0.01% for low values of @xmath71 to 1% for the highest prompt emission luminosities .",
    "it implies larger assumed values of the wind luminosity @xmath20 for a given prompt emission luminosity @xmath71 . practically , to reproduce prompt emission luminosities between @xmath77 and @xmath78 , as in the case of model a , we assume wind luminosities between @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",

    "to discuss cosmic - ray acceleration at grbs internal shocks , it is necessary to model first order fermi acceleration at ( mildly ) relativistic shocks .",
    "fermi acceleration at relativistic shocks has been studied for three decades , early studies pointed out ( see e.g. , the early works by peacock 1981 or kirk & schneider 1987 ) the significant anisotropies in the particles distribution function expected in the downstream ( shocked fluid ) and the upstream ( undisturbed fluid ) media due to the shock velocity .",
    "various shock configurations in terms of the magnetic field obliquity , the level of turbulence or its power spectrum ( kirk & schneider 1987b ; heavens & drury 1988 ; begelman & kirk 1990 ; ostrowski 1991 , 1993 ; bednarz & ostrowski 1998 ; gallant & achterberg 1999 ; kirk et al .",

    "some of these studies suggested in particular that , in the case of a highly turbulent magnetic field and ultrarelativistic shocks , the spectral index of accelerated particles converges to a value of @xmath153 . a more elaborated monte - carlo treatment ( still using the test particle approach ) , considering in particular realistic jump conditions and continuous magnetic field lines across the shock front was proposed by niemiec & ostrowski ( 2004 ) .",
    "their study showed , for mildly relativistic shocks , that the accelerated particles spectral index can highly vary depending on the turbulence type and level or the magnetic field obliquity .",

    "2007 ; bret et al . 2010 ; lemoine & pelletier 2010 , 2011 ) .",
    "moreover , important progresses in the understanding of the microphysics of ultra - relativistic shocks have been obtained with particles in cells ( pic ) simulations ( spitkovsky 2008 ; hashino 2008 ; sironi & spitkovsky 2009 , 2011 ) .",
    "the latter have confirmed that fermi acceleration should be inefficient at strongly magnetized ultra - relativistic shocks while the growth of small scale turbulence is possible ( and then particle acceleration efficient ) for much lower magnetizations . in the meantime ,",
    "the microphysics of mildly relativistic shocks has been much less investigated ; therefore we will limit ourselves to relatively simple magnetic field configurations in what follows .      for our simulation of cosmic - ray acceleration at mildly relativistic shocks , we follow the numerical test particle method developed by niemiec & ostrowski ( 2004 , 2006a , 2006b ) .",
    "the shock front is modeled as an infinite planar discontinuity ( infinitely thin ) . in the upstream medium , the magnetic field",
    "is assumed to be an isotropic and homogenous turbulence to which can be added a regular component with an inclination @xmath154 with respect to the shock normal .",
    "the downstream magnetic field is obtained applying hydrodynamical jump conditions ( synge 1953 ) , which give the shock compression ratio @xmath155 ( @xmath156 and @xmath157 being respectively the velocities of the upstream and downstream fluid in the shock rest frame ) , to the upstream field ( see e.g. , gallant & achterberg 1999 ; lemoine & revenu 2006 ) . the component of the field parallel to the shock normal , @xmath158 , is left unmodified by the shock crossing while the perpendicular component , @xmath159 , is multiplied by a factor @xmath160 ( @xmath161 and @xmath162 being respectively the lorentz factors of the upstream and downstream fluid in the shock rest frame ) .",
    "we then have the following relations : @xmath163 and @xmath164 likewise , we compress the turbulence maximum length scale @xmath165 by a factor r in the direction of the shock propagation following niemiec & ostrowski ( 2004 ) .",
    "we then apply the above - mentioned jump conditions to the upstream field .",
    "this method ensures that the turbulence length scale is properly compressed and that the magnetic field is continuous across the shock front .",
    "the turbulent component of the magnetic field @xmath166 in the upstream medium is described by the summation of sinusoidal static waves .",
    "concretely , the purely turbulent field is represented by a sum of @xmath167 modes as in giacalone and jokipii ( 1999 ) : @xmath168 where @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 are random phases ( chosen once ) and @xmath172 = [ \\mathcal{r}(\\theta_{n},\\phi_{n})]\\times[x , y , z]$ ] are coordinates obtained by a rotation of the reference frame bringing the z axis in the direction of the @xmath173 contributing wave ( i.e. @xmath174 is in direction @xmath175 $ ] , also chosen randomly ) .",

    "we calculate the spectrum of accelerated particles by integrating particles trajectories alternatively in the downstream and in the upstream rest frame during their whole journey in the vicinity of the shock .",
    "the characteristics of a particle ( the energy , the velocity vector , the position and elapsed time in the acceleration region ) are lorentz transformed accordingly at each shock crossing .",

    "an example of a particle trajectory , as seen in the shock frame and projected in the ( x , z ) plane , is shown in fig.[fig : traj ] . in the following ,",
    "we consider particles which are ultra - relativistic already at `` injection '' and on the whole energy range ( the momentum @xmath183 and the rigidity @xmath184 for ultra - relativistic particles ) .",

    "each trajectory is followed in the compressed turbulence in the downstream medium until the particle either returns to the shock or is advected far away , in which case we consider the particle will never come to the shock front again . in practice",

    "we checked that changing this duration criterion to larger values did not affect any of the results shown in the following .",
    "after the trajectories of all the particles have been computed , the particles that have been advected far away downstream are replaced by duplicating those that managed to return to the shock front following the trajectory splitting algorithm of niemiec & ostrowski ( 2004 ) .",
    "the strategy is to divide the weight of the duplicated particle according to the number of duplications it suffered .",
    "the position of the daughter particle is then slightly modified by a small fraction of the minimum turbulence length scale of the magnetic field .",
    "the characteristics of the new set of @xmath185 particles are then lorentz transformed to follow each trajectory in the upstream frame until the particle either crosses the shock again or escape far away upstream . for the latter case ,",

    "all the calculated spectra exhibit an initial bump corresponding to the larger mean energy gain experienced during the first fermi cycle ( see for instance gallant & achterberg 1999 ) due to the assumed initial isotropy of the particles in the upstream rest frame .",

    "a similar behavior was already found and discussed in niemiec & ostrowski ( 2004 ) . at low energy",
    "the probability for the particles to be reflected after crossing the shock from upstream to downstream is large due to the compression of the magnetic field behind the shock and the low amplitude of the turbulence in the resonant modes for low energy particles .",
    "diffusion across field lines becomes gradually more efficient as the energy increases , leading to a decrease of the reflection probability which results in a softening of the spectra . at higher energy ( close to @xmath189 ) the spectra show another hardening of the slope as particles enter the weak scattering regime ( @xmath199 ) .    .",

    "is finally observed in all cases due to the efficient escape through the free boundary we placed in the upstream medium . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : up_down ] , the spectra of particles escaping upstream are extremely peaked as the escape upstream of the shock is only efficient for particles with energies close to @xmath189 which are only weakly deflected by the magnetic turbulence and can outrun the shock long enough to reach the boundary .",
    "the energy range on which the escape upstream is operative mainly depends on two physical parameters , namely the distance of the free boundary and the shock lorentz factor .",
    "the spectrum of particles escaping upstream is expected to be shifted to higher ( resp .",

    "closer ) from the shock ( however , we observed that placing the free boundary at a distance @xmath204 from the shock instead of @xmath205 only produces a slight shift to lower energies ) .",
    "the shock lorentz factor dependence is also intuitive ( and the effect can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : up_down ] ) : the faster the shock the higher the energies of escaping particles , since particles of a given energy will be more easily caught up by the shock before reaching the escape boundary if the shock velocity is higher .",

    "the escape upstream can however strongly depend on its obliquity , characterized by the parameter @xmath207 ( the angle between @xmath206 and the normal to the shock ) , and on the turbulence level ( i.e. the ratio @xmath208 ) .",
    "although we will exclusively use purely turbulent magnetic fields with a kolmogorov power spectrum in our final calculations ( with energy losses ) , we found it useful to discuss how predictions on the accelerated particle spectrum and acceleration time are affected when assuming different background magnetic field structures . in the following , we consider the effect of the turbulence power spectrum , the turbulence level and the presence of a regular magnetic field component with different obliquities .",

    "the escape upstream is however still favored for the quasi - parallel shock configuration and somewhat suppressed for higher obliquities at this level of turbulence .",
    "overall , the trends we observe are in good agreement with the more complete study of cosmic - ray acceleration at mildly relativistic shock of niemiec & ostrowski ( 2004 ) .",
    "the fraction of the available energy that can be communicated to very - high or ultra - high energy particles appears to depend on the shock physical parameters ; the optimum case is reached when assuming a kolmogorov or kraichnan turbulence power spectrum .",

    "as can be easily understood from our discussions , even a significant change of the prior value of @xmath165 would not strongly impact the results discussed in the next sections .      before turning to the monte - carlo calculations ,",
    "we briefly discuss the influence of the wind duration ( which closely correspond to the time width of a light pulse in the central source frame ) by compressing the lorentz factor distribution we use in sect .  2 ( @xmath15s ) to 0.2 or expanding it to 20s .",
    "as long grbs have durations ranging from a few seconds to a few hundreds of seconds ( regarding the prompt emission ) , one can observe shorter or longer light pulses , than the typical one second half width we considered so far . to compare the @xmath263 expectation for @xmath306s and @xmath307s with those obtained for @xmath15s",

    "as can be intuitively anticipated , for a given lorentz factor distribution , the radius at which the shock is formed as well as the range of distances over which the shock propagation takes place are , in good approximation proportional to @xmath305 . as a result ( see sect .  2 ) , for a given wind luminosity , baryons and photon densities are expected to scale roughly as @xmath309 , the magnetic field as well as the dynamical time scale roughly as @xmath310 .",
    "it means that the energy loss rates by hadronic interactions , photo - interactions or synchrotron are expected to scale as well as @xmath309 while the adiabatic loss rate and the acceleration should scale as @xmath310 .",
    "the competition between acceleration and the different sources of energy losses and acceleration is then expected to depend on @xmath305 ( all the other parameters being fixed ) . passing from @xmath15s to @xmath306s ,",
    "the synchrotron , photo - interactions and hadronic interactions compete more efficiently with acceleration and adiabatic losses .",
    "the acceleration is then limited by photodisintegration during the whole shock propagation for fe nuclei and the values of @xmath263 we obtain are lower than for the @xmath15s case . for protons ,",
    "acceleration is initially limited by photo - interactions which results in lower values of @xmath263 , compared with the @xmath15s case . at larger distance ( above @xmath311 cm in fig .",
    "[ fig : twind ] ) , adiabatic losses become dominant and the values @xmath263 is equivalent to the one obtained in the @xmath15s case , as the adiabatic loss time and the acceleration time scale in approximately the same way with @xmath305 . for the longest wind duration ( @xmath307s ) , on the contrary , the acceleration region is more transparent , the acceleration rate and adiabatic loss rates decrease more slowly than the interaction and synchrotron loss rates .",
    "photodisintegration as a weaker impact on fe nuclei acceleration at the beginning of the shock propagation , and the values of @xmath263 obtained are larger than in the 2s case . at larger distances ( or for the whole shock propagation in the case of protons ) , the acceleration is limited by adiabatic losses as in the 2s case .",
    "thus @xmath263 is equivalent to the @xmath15s case , for the reasons explained above . for a given lorentz factor distribution and a given wind luminosity , taking into account the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : twind ] and our discussion in the previous paragraph , the escape of nuclei would be favored in the case of the longest wind duration while the emission of secondary particles ( neutrons , neutrinos , photons ) would be enhanced for shorter durations .    finally , let us note that changing the lorentz factor profile of the wind ( which goes from @xmath312 to @xmath313 for our generic case ) could also slightly modify the results , but to a lower extent . a larger ( resp .",
    "lower ) lorentz factor contrast would result in more ( resp .",

    "slower ) cosmic - ray acceleration and slightly larger ( resp .",
    "lower ) cosmic - ray energies in the central object frame .",
    "these quantities evolve however quite slowly with the lorentz factor contrasts and we checked that our results would not be significantly affected by assuming @xmath314 or @xmath315 for instance .",
    "we will now explicitly calculate the expected cosmic - ray output from grb internal shocks , implementing the energy loss processes introduced in sect .  4 into the relativistic fermi acceleration code described in sect .",
    "3 . in the following ,",
    "as mentioned earlier , adiabatic , synchrotron and pair production losses are modeled as continuous energy loss processes while photomeson production ( for protons ) , photodisintegration ( for nuclei ) and hadronic interactions are treated stochastically . besides the treatment of energy losses and secondary particle production , the principles of the calculation remain the same as what was done in sect .",
    "practically , the integration of the trajectory of a given particle is divided in small time steps corresponding to either a tenth of the particle larmor time , a thirtieth of the particle interaction time ( summed over all the processes treated stochastically ) or a hundredth of the particle energy loss time ( summed over all the continuous energy loss processes ) , whichever the shortest . once the trajectory integration has been performed , the energy of the particle is corrected to take into account continuous energy losses and the emitted synchrotron photons and @xmath245 pairs are stored as attributes of the particle .",
    "the occurrence of stochastic interactions is then checked according to their probability on the time step .",
    "whenever an interaction occurs , the process involved is chosen randomly ( according to the relative probability of the different processes ) along with its inelasticity ( energy and/or nucleon losses ) and the corresponding secondary particle emission ( mainly charged mesons and photons ) .",
    "the secondary particles are stored ( as well as the synchrotron photons and @xmath245 pairs from continuous processes ) and treated in post analysis , to calculate their energy losses ( mainly synchrotron for charged particles ) and decay , taking into account the physical conditions at the time and place of their production .",
    "this ultimately results in the emission of ( mostly ) very high energy neutrinos and photons .",
    "secondary nucleons are treated as new particles created at the time and place of their production , with the weight of their parent nucleus .",
    "they can be further accelerated by performing fermi cycles once they are produced ( in the case of neutrons , they have to decay or interact before leaving the acceleration region ) .",
    "their trajectories and energy losses are calculated from their production point in the same way as their parent nucleus .    for a given burst defined by a set of physical parameters particles",
    "are injected at 18 different times / radii corresponding to the 18 snapshots used in the previous sections to discretize the shock propagation .",
    "the physical conditions relevant for a given snapshot ( i.e , the variance of the turbulent field , the shock lorentz factor , the baryon density , the prompt photon density , the dissipated energy available for cosmic - rays ) are derived in the framework of the grb internal shock model described in sect .",
    "the magnetic field is assumed to be purely turbulent and to follow a kolmogorov power spectrum .",
    "the maximum turbulence length scale @xmath165 is set to be equal to the larmor radius of protons at the energy @xmath316 , where @xmath22 is the snapshot number , as discussed in sect .",
    "4 . for each snapshot , 7500 particles ( protons , he , o , si and fe nuclei in equal number ) are initially injected upstream of the shock with an energy @xmath317 ( where @xmath6 is the charge of the nucleus ) .",
    "the different nuclear species are given a weight in order to reproduce an effective composition equivalent to the galactic cosmic - ray source composition ( du vernois & thayer , 1996 ) with a metallicity ( i.e , the relative abundance of nuclei heavier than he ) enhanced by a factor 10 .",
    "to normalize the spectrum , obtained for a given snapshot , we take advantage of the fact that low energy particles , say below @xmath318 , loose very little energy during the time elapsed between their injection and their last shock crossing before being advected downstream .",
    "we then assume that these low energy particles carry the same fraction of the total energy communicated to cosmic - ray ( @xmath319 for a given snapshot ) as in the absence of energy losses ( i.e , the spectra obtained in sect .",
    "this assumption allows us to estimate the correspondence between the particles weights and the actual number of particles .    concerning particles escape , we assume , as discussed in sects .",
    "3.3.3 and 4.2.3 , that particles might escape through boundaries upstream and downstream of the shock .",
    "the boundary downstream is determined by the hydrodynamic simulation of daigne & mochkovitch ( 2000 ) ( see fig . [",
    "fig : epaisseur ] ) which gives us , at any time of the shock propagation , the comoving distance @xmath320 between the shock front and the extremity of the shocked medium .",
    "the relation between @xmath320 and @xmath165 ( under our assumption @xmath321 ) ) depends on the grb physical parameters and on the distance to the central source and is dermined at each step in a consistent way .",
    "the width of the shocked region @xmath320 goes from a few @xmath165 ( relatively large distance from the central source ) to a few tens of @xmath165 ( for very luminous bursts and early times of the shock propagation ) . for the boundary upstream",
    ", we keep the hypothesis used in sect .  3 , that the magnetic turbulence only extends up to a distance @xmath322 away from the shock . in the following , we use @xmath323 . as discussed in sect .  3.3.3",
    ", both boundaries should behave like high pass filters in the presence of energy losses .",
    "indeed , in the downstream region , particles have to reach the boundary fast enough not to be cooled down to low energies by adiabatic losses ( or any other significant energy loss mechanism ) .",
    "once particles have reached a boundary , either upstream or downstream , we assume they are decoupled from the magnetic field and the wind expansion and can freely propagate away from the source environment .",
    "although particles might still interact with photons created in other parts of the wind , once they have escaped from the acceleration site , it is likely that the photon fields encountered will be much more tenuous than those experienced during the acceleration , and that head - on photon - nucleus collisions will be highly suppressed ( see discussion in sect .  2 ) .",
    "in the following , we simulate the acceleration of cosmic - rays at grb internal shocks for a wide range of wind luminosities , from @xmath92 to @xmath70 ( which corresponds to @xmath324 to @xmath325 ) .",
    "we consider the three energy redistribution models , a , b and c introduced in sect .  2 .",
    "to take into account the evolution of the cosmic - ray and secondary particle outputs during the shock propagation , the 18 snapshots corresponding to different stages of the shock evolution and the corresponding set of physical parameters are considered for each simulated burst .",

    "this is especially important not to overestimate energy losses and secondary particles production of low energy nuclei advected downstream of the shock ( i.e , below the weak scattering regime ) .",
    "these particles may , indeed , be confined during a significant fraction of the whole shock propagation time , much longer than the time a given snapshot remains representative of the physical conditions at work .",

    "these neutrons are produced in vast majority by the photodisintegration of nuclei during the early stage of the shock propagation .    at intermediate values of @xmath83 , represented by the case @xmath101 ( @xmath330 ) on the central panels of figs .",

    "this results in a lower relative abundance of nuclei compared to protons and a more reduced difference between the maximum energies reached by the different species .",
    "the neutron component is in this case very intense as the photon density is so large that nuclei are photodisintegrated efficiently even at lower energies .",
    "the gap in energy between the escaping protons and neutrons is also reduced due to the fact that proton acceleration is limited by photomeson production during the early stage of the shock propagation , which implies that the accelerated protons also contribute to neutron production at high luminosity ( although the contribution of nuclei photodisintegration is still largely dominant ) .",
    "these neutrons should ultimately decay back to protons outside of the source environment and contribute to the proton component far away from the central source . as a consequence",
    ", we see that for intermediate and high luminosity bursts , one can expect the spectrum of escaping protons to be significantly softer than the spectrum of escaping nuclei due to the contribution of escaping neutrons which are mostly produced by nuclei photodisintegration .",
    "these qualitative discussions on the evolution of the cosmic - ray output as a function of @xmath83 and the corresponding @xmath71 hold for the three energy redistribution models a , b and c which , by assumption , predict similar photon densities within the acceleration region for a given value of @xmath83 .",

    "part of the increase of the maximum energy due to the larger value of the magnetic fields for models b and c is indeed counterbalanced to some extent as particles are accelerated to higher energies where photo - interaction rates are higher .",

    "the spread of the predictions would of course be much larger if protons were dominant , say around @xmath1 ev , since these protons would cumulate both characteristics of being the highest rigidity particles ( i.e , the least spread by the effect of the egmf ) and having a reduced horizon because of severe interactions with cmb photons .",

    "all the models predict an increase of the cosmic - ray mean mass with energy , as could be anticipated form the results shown in sect .  5 .",

    "the source spectrum cuts - off below the photomeson production threshold with cmb photons in all cases . as a result , the highest energy protons are less affected by energy losses in the intergalactic medium than the highest energy nuclei .",

    "the ankle - like break in the light cr spectrum at @xmath431 ev ( apel et al .",
    "2013 ) implies that the light galactic component ( and then probably the proton component ) extends at least up to this energy .",
    "it further implies that the heavy galactic component ( at least the fe component ) should extend at least up to @xmath435 ev , which is very close to the ankle energy .",
    "this point is further supported by the fact that the post `` fe - knee '' heavy component ( which again has a spectral slope compatible with that of the pre - ankle light component ) does not show any evidence for a cut - off in the whole energy range covered by kascade - grande , which extends up to @xmath2 ev ( apel et al .",
    "an extragalactic component such as that predicted by models b and c would fit rather well in this picture , emerging around @xmath288 ev ( where it represents a few percents of the total spectrum ) , completely dominating the galactic component at the ankle with a composition still dominated by light nuclei , and getting progressively heavier as the energy increases .",
    "+ although the above picture looks quite consistent , let us not for forget that a full study of the hadronic model dependence of the features claimed by the kascade - grande experiment is still needed .",
    "moreover , the current overlap between the energy ranges covered by the kascade - grande and auger experiments is very small .",
    "this situation should however improve significantly in the next few years since the low energy extensions of auger ( abreu et al . 2011 ) and ta ( tale , sagawa et al .",
    "2009 ) are expected to increase the energy range covered by both experiments down to @xmath431 ev ( and even below in the case of tale ) , then fully covering the energy range where the gcr - to - egcr transition is expected to take place .",
    "it is interesting to note that our results can not , in principle , be obtained in standard extragalactic propagation studies , where it is usually assumed that all the nuclear species are emitted from their sources with similar injection spectra ( following the same power law ) and maximum energies scaling with the charge of the nuclei . in that case",
    ", one can explain the auger composition trend within the framework of the so - called `` low proton @xmath189 models '' ( allard et al .",
    "2008 ) , assuming that the proton component is not accelerated up to the highest energies , unlike heavier nuclei . in this case",
    ", the models that best reproduce the auger composition trend usually need very hard spectral indices at the sources .",
    "although these models can give a quite consistent account of the auger data , they have more difficulties explaining the presence of a significant extragalactic component down to a few @xmath288 ev . in the acceleration models investigated here ,",
    "these usual assumptions are broken in a completely natural way , as a direct consequence of the acceleration process ( including the energy / nucleon losses during the process ) and not as an _ ad hoc _ attempt to reproduce the data .",
    "+ finally , it is worth mentioning that the gcr - to - egcr transition scenario implied by our results can certainly not claim to be a characteristic signature of the acceleration of uhecr at grb internal shocks .",
    "the softer proton component we obtained seems to be a natural consequence of the acceleration of cosmic - ray nuclei in a high density radiation environment and can probably be expected in the context of other candidate sources .",
    "we finally turn to the calculation of the diffuse neutrino flux expected from grbs on earth , for our different models .",
    "it is well known that , unlike uhecrs , neutrinos suffer only from adiabatic losses due to the expansion of the universe , and then have horizons comparable to the size of the universe . in this context , the calculation of the diffuse neutrino flux is much more straightforward than the diffuse uhecr flux . using the neutrino emission by single grbs calculated in sect .",

    "even the highest flux predicted for model c would be difficult to detect within the lifetime of the icecube experiment .",

    "the difference between the neutrino flux predicted for model a and those predicted for models b and c is smaller than the differences we found for uhecrs . due to the important contribution of the highest luminosity grbs , these predictions",

    ", we modeled internal shocks using the simple approach implemented by daigne & mochkovitch ( 1998 ) , where the relativistic outflow emitted by the central engine is represented by a large number of shells that interact with one another , discretizing the propagation of a collisionless shock within the outflow .",
    "this treatment allowed us to estimate the key physical quantities at work during the internal shock phase and their evolution during the shock propagation . within this framework",

    "b and c , we made a different assumption on the dissipated energy redistribution parameters using much lower values for @xmath280 , which implies that most of the dissipated energy is communicated to the accelerated cosmic - rays and the magnetic field ( using @xmath450 ( resp .",

    "3 , we performed numerical simulations of cosmic - ray acceleration at mildly relativistic shocks , using numerical tools inspired by the work of niemiec & ostrowski ( 2004 ) .",
    "we considered lorentz factors between 1 and 2 , which is the typical range expected at grb internal shocks .",
    "we tested various magnetic field configurations in the vicinity of the shock , assuming different turbulence power spectra , turbulence levels or regular field obliquities .",
    "after setting escape conditions upstream and downstream of the shock , we calculated the spectra of particles escaping downstream and upstream as well as the energy evolution of the acceleration time for different magnetic field configurations .",
    "most of the spectra of particles advected downstream deviated significantly from single power laws , as already pointed out by niemiec & ostrowski ( 2004 ) . in the cases of purely turbulent fields",

    "[ eq : emax ] ) .",
    "however , the expected slope of the spectrum of the particles advected downstream was found to be strongly dependent on the assumed magnetic field configuration in the vicinity of the shock .",
    "quasi parallel shocks with low turbulence level were found to give the hardest spectra ( well harder than @xmath453 ) , while quasi - perpendicular `` superluminal '' shocks resulted in much softer spectra with sharp cut - offs below @xmath189 .",
    "+ for the particles escaping upstream of the shock , assuming a free boundary escape at a few @xmath204 away from the shock front , we found extremely hard spectra , starting at energies slightly below @xmath189 where the particles enter the weak scattering regime and can outrun the shock for a long enough time to reach the boundary .",
    "the very efficient escape at energies larger than @xmath189 results in a cut - off of the spectrum and gives a bell - like shape to the spectrum of particles escaping upstream of the shock .",
    "compared to the purely turbulent case , the escape upstream was found to be more efficient for quasi - parallel shocks and highly suppressed for quasi - perpendicular `` superluminal '' shocks .",
    "+ concerning the energy evolution of the acceleration time , we also found a broken power law shape with a significant hardening of the evolution at energies slightly below @xmath189 where particles enter the weak scattering regime . at low energy , the shape of the evolution and the value of the acceleration time at a given energy strongly depend on the assumed magnetic field configuration ( in particular on the assumed turbulence power spectrum ) . at higher energy , in the weak scattering regime , the shape of the evolution becomes practically independent of the assumed power spectrum in the purely turbulent case .",
    "the acceleration time at @xmath238 , was found to lie between @xmath120 15 and 80 ( depending on the shock lorentz factor ) larmor times of the particles at this energy , quite far from the so - called `` bohm scaling '' ( @xmath454 ) .",
    "such an optimistic assumption on the acceleration time would require very different magnetic field configurations from those envisaged here , if not a different acceleration mechanism .    in sect .",
    "4 , using the physical quantities estimated in sect .  2 , we calculated the uhecr energy loss times expected at internal shocks for the most relevant energy loss processes , i.e , photo - hadronic interactions , hadron - hadron interactions , synchrotron radiation and adiabatic losses .",
    "these energy loss times were calculated as functions of energy for different nuclear species , from protons to fe nuclei , at different times of the shock propagation and different prompt emission luminosities , for each of the above - mentioned models .",
    "preliminary estimates of the maximum energy achievable at grb internal shocks could thus be obtained by comparing these energy loss times with the acceleration times obtained in sect .  3 , assuming purely turbulent magnetic fields following a kolmogorov power spectrum .",
    "we found that , in most cases , the maximum energy reachable by uhecrs is either limited by photo - interactions or adiabatic losses , depending on the burst luminosity and the stage of the shock propagation .",
    "photodisintegration is the limiting process for the acceleration of uhecr nuclei at the beginning of the shock propagation in the case of intermediate luminosity grbs ( @xmath455 , @xmath456 ) and during most of the shock propagation for the highest luminosity grbs .",
    "photomeson production is the limiting process for the acceleration of protons only at the early stages of the shock propagation for very high luminosity bursts .",
    "both protons and nuclei are limited by adiabatic losses during the whole shock propagation for low luminosity grbs and during a significant fraction of the shock propagation for intermediate luminosity grbs . in these cases ,",
    "the maximum energy of the different nuclear species are expected to scale with the charge of the nucleus . in all other cases ,",
    "the gap in maximum energy between protons and the other nuclear species is expected to be smaller than the factor @xmath6 .",
    "+ comparing the maximum energies obtained for the different energy redistribution models , we found that those obtained for models b and c were significantly larger than those predicted for model a , especially at low and intermediate grb luminosities , due to the larger magnetic fields implied by the physical hypotheses defining models b and c. in the case of model a , maximum energies of the order of @xmath1 ev ( in the central source rest frame ) were only reached by heavy nuclei for intermediate luminosity bursts . for models",
    "b and c , on the other hand , heavy nuclei were able to reach energies of the order of @xmath1 ev or above , already for low luminosity grbs ( especially in the case of model c ) , while intermediate mass nuclei ( cno ) reached @xmath1 ev in the cases of intermediate luminosity grbs .",
    "the maximum energy of protons remained significantly lower than @xmath1 ev , in all the cases we studied , reaching at most @xmath457 ev , in the case of model c and high luminosity bursts .",
    "we also discussed the escape of accelerated particles from the acceleration site and the importance of the value of the maximum turbulence scale of the magnetic field , @xmath204 , in particular when energy losses are considered .",
    "accelerated particles are expected to suffer from energy losses at all energies and must leave the acceleration site before being cooled .",
    "particles that have reached the weak scattering regime ( i.e , particles with larmor radii of the order of @xmath204 ) should escape more efficiently than those at lower energy . as a result ,",
    "the escape process should behave as a high - pass filter , both upstream and downstream of the shock .",
    "+ after discussing different possible situations and their consequences on accelerated cosmic - ray escape and secondary particle production , we set a prescription on the assumed value @xmath204 for our subsequent calculations : since for all our models , accelerated cosmic - rays are assumed to carry a significant fraction of the dissipated energy , we assumed that the maximum turbulence scale is equal to the larmor radius of the highest rigidity accelerated particles ( which correspond to the highest energy accelerated protons in all the cases we considered ) , for a given grb at a given stage of the shock propagation .",
    "this assumption represents an optimum situation for protons escape but not necessarily for heavier nuclei , since the rigidities reached by accelerated nuclei can be significantly lower than those of protons when the acceleration process is limited by photodisintegration . as a result ,",
    "nuclei heavier than protons are not guaranteed to reach the weak scattering regime , for instance in the case of high luminosity grbs .    in sect .  5",
    ", we included the energy loss mechanisms into the monte - carlo calculation of cosmic - ray acceleration at mildly relativistic shocks .",
    "we performed simulations reproducing the physical conditions ( magnetic fields , baryon and photon densities , shock lorentz factors ) estimated in sect .  2 , at different stages of the shock propagation .",
    "this treatment allowed us to estimate the cosmic - ray and secondary neutrino emission , for a grb of a given luminosity , and its evolution during the shock propagation .",
    "we calculated cosmic - ray and neutrino outputs for different grb luminosities and our three energy redistribution models , assuming a composition with ten times the metallicity of galactic cosmic - ray sources .",
    "the main trends we extracted from our calculations were very similar to those anticipated from our discussion in sect .  4 : + ( _ i _ ) we found hard escaping cosmic - ray spectra for the different nuclear species as a result of the selection of high energy / rigidity particles by the escape process .",
    "+ ( _ ii _ ) the maximum energies of protons did not exceed a few @xmath7 ev , in the most optimistic cases .",
    "intermediate and heavy nuclei could reach energies of the order or above @xmath1 ev , in particular in the cases of models b and c. + ( _ iii _ ) the escape of nuclei heavier than protons was strongly suppressed for high luminosity grbs .",
    "+ in addition to these trends , we found , in the cases of intermediate or high luminosity grbs , significant neutron components due to the photodisintegration of nuclei during the acceleration process .",
    "these neutron spectra appear to be much softer than those of the other nuclear species and to dominate at low energy , since neutron escape is not impacted by magnetic fields and the interaction probabilities of these neutrons in the acceleration site is low .",
    "these soft neutron component is , of course , expected to ultimately decay to protons during the extragalactic propagation .",
    "+ concerning neutrinos , we found a very strong evolution of the neutrino emission with the grb luminosity , which was expected since both the photon density and the energy communicated to accelerated cosmic - rays increase with the grb luminosity ( the latter , however , evolves differently for model a , on the one hand , and models b and c , on the other hand ) . for a given grb luminosity",
    ", we also found an evolution from a soft to a hard neutrino output as the shock propagates .",
    "this evolution is due to the combined effect of lower cosmic - ray photomeson interaction thresholds and larger magnetic fields expected at early times of the shock propagation .    finally , in sect .  6 , we calculated the expected uhecr and neutrino diffuse fluxes on earth , by convoluting the cosmic - ray and neutrino release obtained for given grb luminosities , with the distribution of grb luminosities , taking also into account their cosmological evolution as recently derived by wanderman & piran ( 2010 ) .",
    "+ in the case of model a , we obtained an integrated cosmic - ray luminosity density , above @xmath2 ev , of the order of @xmath458 , almost two orders of magnitude below that required to reproduce the observed uhecr flux .",
    "this means that grbs are very strongly disfavored as the dominant source of uhecrs , if the dissipated energy is equally shared between accelerated electrons and cosmic - rays , as already concluded by several authors .",
    "+ for models b and c , we found uhecr luminosity densities of @xmath459 and @xmath460 respectively , of the same order as those required .",
    "we then simulated the extragalactic propagation of uhecr from grb sources , considering ( _ i _ ) different assumptions on the egmf variance , ( _ ii _ ) the cases of isotropic or beamed grbs , ( _ iii _ ) a large number of realizations of the history of grb explosions in the universe .",
    "we found that the magnitude of the observed uhecr flux is well reproduced by models b and c , providing very moderate renormalizations of the predicted fluxes by @xmath67 downward and @xmath461 upward , respectively .",
    "the shape of the observed uhecr spectrum is also well reproduced above the ankle by both models , particularly by model c. + concerning the evolution of the composition , we found a good qualitative agreement with the trend suggested by the auger data : a light composition at the ankle becoming gradually heavier with increasing energy . because of the slightly higher maximum energies predicted , model c differs from model b by a slight shift in energy of the decrease of the proton component .",
    "+ at lower energies , the presence of a softer proton component has interesting consequences for the phenomenology of the gcr - to - egcr transition .",
    "the progressive increase of the contribution of the extragalactic component between @xmath431 ev and the ankle , implied by model b or c , is very similar to that of the mixed composition model studied in allard et al .",
    "( 2007b ) which was shown to be in good agreement with fly s eye and hires - mia data .",
    "moreover , by predicting extragalactic components which are already significant at a few @xmath288 ev , models b and c are also in good qualitative agreement with the recent results of the kascade - grande experiment .",
    "as we discussed earlier , the prediction of softer proton components is probably not a distinctive signature of grb sources but a generic feature of strongly magnetized sources harbored in dense environments , partially opaque to cosmic - rays .",
    "+ we finally calculated diffuse neutrino fluxes from grb sources as well as cosmogenic neutrino and photon fluxes , and found that those fluxes were currently not constrained by any experimental measurement or limit .    in conclusion , we have developed a numerical tool to compute the acceleration of particles at mildly relativistic shocks .",
    "this code includes energy losses and handles particle escape according to specific prescriptions , which can be adapted to different astrophysical environments and physical conditions . in this paper , we applied our code to the case of grbs in the framework of the internal shock model , with different assumptions about the redistribution of the energy released by the collision of shells of different lorentz factors .",
    "the model takes into account the dynamical evolution of the grb , by summing the weighted contributions of successive stages of the shock propagation , with the corresponding values of the relevant physical parameters .",
    "we have shown that particle acceleration can indeed be efficient in such environments , including for heavy nuclei , which survive photo - dissociation for a large range of grb luminosities , during a significant fraction of the shock propagation .",
    "we also showed that , once the distribution of grbs in the universe is taken into account ( in luminosity and rate density ) , the overall energetic particle production of grbs may account for the observed uhecr flux , in the case of the models b and c investigated here .",
    "this includes not only the total flux , but also the shape of the uhecr spectrum and the evolution of the composition as a function of energy . in particular , protons are found to be accelerated up to energies of the order @xmath0  ev at most , while intermediate and heavy nuclei are able to reach higher values , of the order of @xmath1 ev and above . on the other hand , in the case the energy redistribution parameters corresponding to model a",
    ", the grbs would fall short of being able to power the uhecrs by a large factor .",
    "it may seem that the physical assumptions behind models b and c are somewhat extreme , from the energetics point of view , by requiring a much larger power in cosmic rays than in the photons responsible for the grb prompt emission .",
    "however , we draw attention on the fact that this does not increase the maximum power usually assumed for the grbs by unreasonable factors . as a matter of fact , the highest luminosity grbs ( @xmath462  erg @xmath463 ) require a wind power of only a factor of 3 for models b and c larger than for model a , while the difference in the power needed increases for lower luminosity grbs , to reach a factor of 300 at the lowest luminosity . as a consequence ,",
    "the spread in the assumed intrinsic power of gbrs is smaller in the case of models b and c than in the case of model a ( 2 orders of magnitude instead of 4 , see fig .  [ fig : lwind ] ) .",
    "another key assumption in our calculation of the uhecr input from grbs is the fact that early development of the burst is compatible with the presence of nuclei heavier than protons in the relativistic wind at the beginning of the internal shock phase . further observational and theoretical constraints on the grb central engine and the origin of the prompt emission will be needed to evaluate the validity of our hypotheses .",
    "finally , we note that the diffuse neutrino fluxes from grbs of the order of those calculated in sect .",
    "6 should be within the reach of high - energy neutrino observatories such as icecube or the future km3net . within the lifetime of these observatories , neutrinos",
    "should then give key constraints on the scenarios elaborated in this study .",
    "likewise , more constraints on the nature of the uhecr sources should be provided by accumulating larger statistics at the highest energies , with the pierre auger and telescope array observatories , and with the future jem - euso experiment onboard the international space station .",

    "<S> we study the acceleration of cosmic - ray protons and nuclei at grb internal shocks . </S>",
    "<S> physical quantities ( magnetic fields , baryon and photon densities , shock velocity ) and their time evolution , relevant to cosmic - ray acceleration and energy losses , are estimated using the internal shock modeling implemented by daigne & mochkovitch ( 1998 ) . within this framework , we consider different hypotheses about the way the energy dissipated at internal shocks is shared between accelerated cosmic - rays , electrons and the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we model cosmic - ray acceleration at mildly relativistic shocks , using numerical tools inspired by the work of niemiec & ostrowski ( 2004 ) , including all the significant energy loss processes that might limit cosmic - ray acceleration at grb internal shocks . </S>",
    "<S> + we calculate cosmic - ray and neutrino release from single grbs , for various prompt emission luminosities , assuming that nuclei heavier than protons are present in the relativistic wind at the beginning of the internal shock phase . we find that protons can only reach maximum energies of the order @xmath0 ev in the most favorable cases , while intermediate and heavy nuclei are able to reach higher values of the order of @xmath1 ev and above . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra of particles escaping from the acceleration site are found to be very hard for the different nuclear species . </S>",
    "<S> in addition a significant and much softer neutron component is present in the cases of intermediate and high luminosity grbs due to the photodisintegration of accelerated nuclei during the early stages of the shock propagation . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the combined spectrum of protons and neutrons from single grbs is found to be much softer than those of the other nuclear species . </S>",
    "<S> + we calculate the diffuse uhecr flux expected on earth by convoluting the cosmic - ray output from single grbs of various luminosities by the grb luminosity function derived by wanderman & piran ( 2010 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that only the models assuming that ( _ i _ ) the prompt emission represent only a very small fraction of the energy dissipated at internal shocks ( especially for low and intermediate luminosity bursts ) , and that ( _ ii _ ) most of this dissipated energy is communicated to accelerated cosmic - rays , are able to reproduce the magnitude of the uhecr flux observed on earth . for these models , </S>",
    "<S> the observed shape of the uhecr spectrum can be well reproduced above the ankle and the evolution of the composition is compatible with the trend suggested by auger data . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications of the softer proton component ( consequence of the neutron emission in the sources ) for the phenomenology of the transition from galactic to extragalactic cosmic - ray , in the light of the recent composition analyses from the kascade - grande experiment . </S>",
    "<S> + finally , we find that the associated secondary particle diffuse fluxes do not upset any current observational limit or measurement . diffuse neutrino flux from grb sources of the order of those we calculated </S>",
    "<S> should however be detected with the lifetime of neutrino observatories such as icecube or km3net .    </S>",
