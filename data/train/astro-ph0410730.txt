    "as the energy production stops , an isothermal core appears .",
    "the models are now located between the last two dots on the evolutionary track in figure  [ fig : evol ] ( lp ) . as hydrogen is burned in the shell , the isothermal core increases in mass .",
    "however , its mass can not exceed the limiting mass of schnberg - chandrasekhar , given by @xmath8 which is of the order of 0.08 .",
    "when this value is reached , the core must contract in order to create a temperature gradient ( see figure  [ fig : temp ] ( lp ) ) and this is accompanied by an expansion of the envelope where the temperature decreases .      in order to fit cm diagrams of open clusters as well as eclipsing binaries",
    ", overshooting seems to be needed with an extent increasing with stellar mass .",
    "we have computed a similar evolution with an overshooting parameter of 0.2 .",
    "a larger hydrogen reservoir due to the increase of the mixed region evidently translates into a longer core hydrogen burning phase as well as in a longer track in the hr diagram ( figure  [ fig : evol ] ( rp ) ) .",
    "however , after the turn - off , for a similar variation in effective temperature , the evolution with overshooting is much more rapid .",
    "figure  [ fig : rad ] ( rp ) shows that @xmath5 never reaches zero so there is no plateau in temperature ( figure  [ fig : temp ] ( rp ) ) .",
    "the reason lies in the fact that with the increase of the mixed region , the exhaustion of hydrogen takes place in a core whose mass is already higher than @xmath9 .",
    "this results in a much quicker contraction of the central regions .",
    "the star moves more rapidly and for a similar change in effective temperature , the shell , shown by a maximum in the distribution of @xmath7 , is still at the same mass fraction with overshooting while the shell has already moved significantly in mass without overshooting ( compare lp with rp in figure  [ fig : eps ] ) .",

    "this results in a different transfer of angular momentum from the star to the disk , which in turn can change the angular momentum at the beginning of the ms phase .    in these",
    "fully or partly convective phases , the treatment of convection affects the location in the hr diagram , creating a significant difference in effective temperature .",
    "figure  [ fig : pms ] ( cp ) shows the location of the hayashi tracks for models computed with the fst treatment of convection ( dashed curves ) and with the mlt treatment ( @xmath14 = 1.6 ) ( faded curves ) .",
    "the difference in effective temperature is of the order of 200k .",
    "as the convective envelope recedes , the tracks become undistinguishable .    however , the extremely thin surface convection zone which remains on the main sequence is affected ( figure  [ fig : pms ] ( rp ) ) .",
    "the most superadiabatic the temperature gradient is , the less efficient is the convection .",
    "for a 1.8@xmath0 , it can make the convective he ii ionization zone appear or disappear .",
    "this is important since the thickness of the mixed superficial layers is crucial in explaining the abundance anomalies .      with such thin convective envelopes ,",
    "gravitational settling is very efficient .",
    "figure  [ fig : can ] illustrates this point .            in the left panel ,",
    "a duck - star has all its chemical elements ( chicken ) showing at the surface . in the middle panel ,",
    "the ms phase is symbolized by the crossing of a grid .",
    "if radiative forces are not taken into account together with gravitational settling , the duck - star ends its ms phase with only one element ( chick ) remaining at the surface",
    ".    however , radiative forces can in turn be too efficient and another mechanism must enter the game .",
    "it is the turbulent mixing which will not only affect the surface abundances but will induce changes in the internal structure as well , especially in the thickness of the convective envelope ( @xcite ) .",
    "one striking example is the formation of a convective iron zone at a temperature of 200000k caused by an accumulation of iron - peak elements as a result of radiative forces . according to the mass of the star",
    ", this zone can merge with the h - he ionisation zone during the main sequence or remain detached , which affects the surface abundances of the iron - peak elements .",
    "from their location in the hr diagram , a - type stars are expected to rotate rapidly and not to be affected by magnetic braking .",
    "they can reach indeed rotational velocities up to 300 kms@xmath17 .",
    "abt & morrel ( 1995 , hereafter am95 ) showed however , that the distribution of rotational velocities has a bimodal shape , with virtually all the am and ap stars having equatorial rotational velocities ( @xmath18 ) less than 120 kms@xmath17 , and most of the normal a0-f0 main - sequence stars having @xmath19  kms@xmath17 .",
    "they concluded ( see also @xcite ) that rotation alone can explain the occurrence of abnormal or normal main - sequence a stars , and that the apparent overlap between their @xmath18 distributions is only due to our inability to distinguish marginal am stars from normal ones , or to disentangle rotational and evolutionary effects .",
    "a large number of observational data indicates that during ms evolution of a - type stars : 1 ) mass loss is limited to @xmath20 @xmath21 .",
    "( lanz & catala , 1992 ) ; 2 ) rotational velocity does not depend on age ; and 3 ) no significant angular momentum loss by magnetic braking is observed ( e.g. wolff & simon , 1997 ; hubrig , north & medici , 2000 ) .",
    "consequently , the observed @xmath18 distribution must be determined by the angular momentum evolution during the pre - main sequence ( pms ) phase . in a study of the distribution of angular momentum in orion stars , @xcite find this hypothesis consistent with a simplified model of pms evolution in which angular momentum is lost by interaction with the protostellar disk during the convective phase , and conserved in the radiative one .",
    "furthermore a core - envelope decoupling occurs during the convective - radiative transition ( see also @xcite and @xcite for ap pms angular momentum evolution ) .",
    "the understanding of angular momentum evolution during the pms and the ms is fundamental to understand the ap and the am phenomena .",
    "rotation has several different effects on stellar evolution : change of the internal hydrostatic equilibrium , changes in the apparent effective temperature and luminosity ( prez hernndez _",
    "_ 1999 and references therein ) ; transport of chemicals and of angular momentum by shears in differentially rotating stars , by meridional circulation an by horizontal turbulence ( e.g. , zahn , 1974 ; knobloch & spruit , 1982 ) .",
    "the effect of rotation on the stellar evolution has been treated with different approaches : endal & sofia ( 1981 ) assigned to each transport process ( including meridional circulation ) a diffusion coefficient , while @xcite and @xcite made the hypothesis that differential rotation in the radiative zone of a non - magnetic star gives rise to anisotropic turbulence ( much stronger in the horizontal direction than in the vertical one due to the stratification ) , and those result in  shellular \" rotation . in this model the effective diffusion coefficient for the chemicals is :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the meridional circulation velocity , @xmath24 is a free parameter related to the turbulent horizontal viscosity , and the other quantities have the habitual meaning .",
    "@xcite has applied the zahn s modeling of rotation with the formulation by @xcite ( including also microscopic diffusion but not radiative accelerations ) to masses from 1.35 to 2.2 @xmath25 .",
    "we recall here two results of this application : 1 ) the rotation profile inside the star shows differential rotation mainly close to the convective core .",
    "2 ) the models ( computed without overshooting ) , show a wider ms when rotation is included . however , while the lower mass models increase their ms lifetime by a 20% , the highest masses increase it by only 10% ( see their fig .  1 ) .",
    "this trend is opposite to that observed in open clusters and in binary systems , where the fitting of observations requires to increase the overshooting parameter with the mass ( i.e. @xcite ; ribas , jordi & gimnez , 2000 ) .",
    "recently , @xcite and independently richard & zahn ( 1999 ) have updated the value for the horizontal diffusion coefficient , @xmath24 by a factor of @xmath26 with respect to the value used in @xcite .",
    "its implementation in a stellar evolution code ( mathis , palacios & zahn 2004 ) leads to : 1 ) enhanced mixing , and 2 ) significant changes in the profile of chemical mixing with depth ( see their fig.2 ) .",
    "to which degree will the new @xmath27 ( with a non - zero value until the boundary of the convective core ) affect the ms width and the surface chemical abundances ?",
    "the scheme proposed by am95 matches qualitatively well the predictions of the microscopic diffusion models ( e.g. richer , richard & michaud 2000 ) , in the hypothesis that the extra - mixing required to decrease the microscopic diffusion is induced by rotation .",
    "some problems are however left , for instance : 1 ) the `` normal '' late b and early a - type main - sequence stars show a true bimodal @xmath18 distribution ( royer , gmez & zorec , these proceedings ) ; 2 ) the binary v392 carinae has a @xmath28 of 27 kms@xmath17 and no peculiar abundance ( debernardi & north 2001 ) .",
    "3 ) there is no correlation between the strength of chemical peculiarities and @xmath18 ( @xcite ) .",
    "models including microscopic diffusion and radiative accelerations show that the chemical abundances are very sensitive to the thickness of the mixed layer ( e.g. , alecian 1996 , @xcite ; @xcite ) , so that we should expect a signature of @xmath18 on the abundances , if rotation is the responsible of the extra - mixing below the convective envelope . a first approach to explicitly include a model of rotationally induced mixing and",
    "a complete treatment of microscopic diffusion is in progress ( richard , talon & michaud , these proceedings ) .    finally , there are also other effects that should be taken into account in the study of the evolution of a rotating a - type star :    \\1 . _ interaction convection - rotation .",
    "_ rotation can reduce the efficiency of convection and is able to reduce the extension of the overshooting region ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recent numerical simulations of the a rotating convective core ( browning , brun & toomre , 2004 ) show that rotation leads to a variation of convective overshooting and penetration , and induces internal waves , meridional circulation , and differential rotation at the core boundary .",
    "_ magnetic field .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that the tayler - spruit magnetic instability ( spruit 2002 ) could take place in the interior of stars with small magnetic fields and differential rotation , induce a process of angular momentum transport much more efficient than that due to the meridional circulation and horizontal turbulence and lead to solid body rotation on a short timescale .",
    "furthermore , in ap stars , which have suffered strong braking during their pms phase ( stpie ' n , 2000 ) , differential rotation together with magnetic field could lead to magneto - rotational instabilities .",
    "these could transport angular momentum from the interior to the surface ( @xcite , and artl , these proceedings ) , and result in solid body rotation of these stars , as expected from some observational data ( hubrig , north & medici , 2000 ) .",
    "binarity plays a fundamental role in the origin and definition of a - type stars chemical peculiarities .",
    "the pioneering work of abt ( 1961 , 1965 ) showed that most ( he even suggested all ) am type stars are relatively short period binaries and that the period distribution of binaries with am and with non - peculiar a - type components are complementary .",
    "normal a - type components are found in systems with period shorter than @xmath29 or longer than @xmath30 days , while am stars form binaries with period in the range 2.5100 days .",
    "abt s statements have somewhat lost of strength with time , and with the increasing size of studied binary samples . some overlap between the period distribution of normal and",
    "am binaries was found by the same author ( am95 ) and the binary frequency among am stars has steadily decreased with time ( see @xcite and @xcite , @xcite for results based on coravel surveys ) .",
    "the latter author finds a frequency as low as 57% ( but coravel samples are certainly biased against fast rotation and , because of the limited time span of the survey , against longer period  eccentric orbit binaries ) .",
    "the  at any rate  high frequency has a straightforward explanation : in close binaries the spin  orbit synchronization by tidal mechanisms can efficiently brake the stellar rotation to values compatible with the am phenomenon .",
    "the other relevant connection between binarity and a - type star peculiarity is in the low frequency of spectroscopic binaries among magnetic ap stars ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the current explanation is that the strong magnetic fields prevent close binary formation ( however , @xcite suggested instead that it is binarity to affect magnetisms and not the other way around ) .",
    "while the general outline of the binarity  peculiarity connection is well established , there are still shortcomings in the theory of tidal synchronization . besides",
    ", possible drawbacks in the interpretation of the observations are caused by the origin and composition of the observed samples ( biases , selection effects ) .",
    "two competing theories were developed to explain the observed levels of orbital circularization and spin  orbit synchronization in close binaries : the tidal theory of @xcite and the hydrodynamical theory of @xcite .",
    "the necessary ingredients of the first are tidal bulges and an efficient dissipation mechanisms ; in absence of synchronism , dissipation causes a lag of the bulge and hence a torque , which tends to establish synchronization ( and orbit circularization ) .",
    "the dissipation mechanisms at work are different for late and early type stars , in the first case it is turbulent dissipation in the convective envelope retarding the equilibrium tide , in the second it is radiative damping acting on the dynamical tide ( forced gravity waves are emitted from the lagging convective core and are damped in the outer layers ) .",
    "tassoul s theory is based , instead , on the idea that while the torque due to dissipation processes is negligible , transient strong meridional currents are produced by the tidal action and transfer angular momentum between the stellar interior and an ",
    "ekman layer \" close to the surface . as a consequence",
    "if the rotation period is shorter than the orbital one , the star is braked .",
    "both theories yield time - scales for synchronization ( @xmath31 ) and circularization ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "for early type stars , in zahn s case : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the mass ratio and the semi - axis of the binary , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 the mass , the radius and the inertial moment of the braked star and @xmath39 a constant related to the size of its convective core . in tassoul",

    "the circularization time is in general two / three orders of magnitude longer than that of synchronization , due to the larger amount of angular momentum stored in the orbit .",
    "it is evident by comparing eqs .",
    "[ zahn ] with [ tassoul ] that tassoul s mechanism has a longer range and a much higher efficiency , especially for early - type stars .",
    "the timescales are  at any rate  _ only an indication _ of the process speed , and can not replace the full integration of the orbital evolution equations .    in principle the comparison between the expected and the observed degree of synchronization / circularization in binaries of known age and accurate dimensions could discriminate between the two theories , and early type stars are the best choice for such a test .",
    "however , the detailed treatment of @xcite and @xcite ( with simultaneous computation of orbital and stellar evolution and a comparison sample of observed binaries with the best known parameters ) showed that the results are still inconclusive , as both models can explain only a part of the observations .",
    "zahn s mechanism is not efficient enough for early type stars ( but the pre - ms phases were not considered in the abovementioned papers ) while tassoul s one is too efficient , unless a high value of @xmath45 is introduced ( to shorten the time - scales by a factor @xmath46 ) .",

    "the data are generally in good agreement with the expectations , with a marginal indication of radii larger than in normal stars ( as the synchronization relations should be upper envelopes , having assumed @xmath47 ) .",
    "the r02 velocities are generally higher than those measured by am95 and used by budaj ; the reason is a systematic effect in the velocity of standard stars used by am95 . as a consequence the  avoidance zone \" , found by @xcite , for periods @xmath57 days ( i.e the region above the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : vrot ] ) is no longer empty and it is not necessary an ad - hoc mechanisms to explain it , such as the  tidal mixing \" introduced by the abovementioned author ; the decreasing number of systems found in proximity of the synchronism lines can be due to a dependence on period of the braking efficiency .",
    "the other feature appearing in figure  [ fig : vrot ] , the lack of systems between @xmath58 days , is quite probably a selection effect due to the low probability of discovery _ as a spectroscopic binary_. an idea of the relevance of selection effects can be derived from the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : vrot ] .",
    "this shows , for a @xmath54 primary , the largest orbital period corresponding to a given minimum observable radial velocity amplitude , @xmath59 . this is a function of mass ratio , @xmath34 , and eccentricity , @xmath60 ( in the hypothesis of inclination @xmath47 ) . even in the conservative hypothesis @xmath53 kms@xmath17",
