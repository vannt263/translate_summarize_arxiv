    "recent years have witnessed a growing technological , experimental , and theoretical interest in scaling standard machinery down to micro- and nano - scales as needed for the development of `` lab on a chip '' devices . for applications in ,",
    "e.g. , drug - delivery systems or micromechanics one of the most challenging problems at this stage is to develop ways to enable small - scale objects to perform autonomous , controlled motion @xcite .",
    "although the research in this area is still in its early stages , several such proposals have already been tested experimentally ( see , e.g. , refs . ) .",
    "a review of the recent progress in this field can be found in ref . .",
    "whitesides and co - workers proposed a design of self - propelling devices based on an asymmetric decoration of the surface of small objects by catalytic , active sites promoting a chemical reaction in the surrounding liquid medium @xcite .",
    "this asymmetric distribution can provide motility through a variety of mechanisms , such as surface tension gradients and/or cyclic adsorption and desorption @xcite .",
    "the use of an asymmetric surface distribution of a catalyst has been further proposed for an autonomous diffusiophoretic motion emerging as a result of self - created density gradients @xcite .",
    "an experimental realization of such systems , using platinum coated polystyrene spheres , has been recently reported @xcite .",
    "the issue of designing optimal distributions of a catalyst for spherical and rod - like particles has also been approached @xcite .    for most of the applications in biological systems or in lab on a chip-type devices",
    "one has to deal with a complicated internal structure of the systems , such as networks of narrow channels or pores and various impenetrable impurities . in some situations",
    ", one may even encounter a quasi two- or one - dimensional behavior , like in the cases of bacteria motion on planar nutrient substrates @xcite and of the motion of small particles within a biological membrane @xcite or in a monolayer adsorbed on a three - dimensional ( _ 3d _ ) liquid subphase @xcite .",
    "thus spatial confinement is a relevant feature so that the assumption of the presence of an unconfined _ 3d _ bulk reactive solvent @xcite may break down .",
    "intuitively , one expects that spatial confinement does influence the resulting motion of self - propelling objects like the ones discussed above .",
    "but _ a priori _ it is not clear if such effects are significant .    starting from the model used in ref .",
    ", here we study the effects of spatial confinement on the phoretic motion of a particle that generates number density gradients of the product molecules emerging from the chemical reactions in the depleting newtonian liquid solvent .",
    "we shall focus on the simple case in which the particle and the _",
    "3d _ solution of solvent and product molecules are bounded by a spherical shell because ( i ) this simple geometry allows for an exact solution and ( ii ) it has been experimentally shown for a variety of phoretic systems that confinement effects are dominated by the smallest confining length scale @xcite .",
    "thus this geometry has a paradigmatic character .",
    "similarly to the earlier studies @xcite , our work is based on adopting the standard theory of phoresis for the present case , in which the gradients are self - generated rather than being produced and maintained by external sources . in doing so ,",
    "one is bound to make a number of assumptions that are either already present in the classical theory of phoresis , or arise as a result of mapping the description of such `` active '' surface particles onto the framework of a theory developed to describe the case of inert particles immersed in a pre - defined , externally controlled concentration gradient . since in the literature these assumptions are often overlooked or not spelled out explicitly , we consider it as necessary to provide also a critical discussion of the significant assumptions involved by this mapping , as well as of some of those assumptions implicitly contained in the standard theory of phoresis . accordingly , the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ model ]",
    "we define the model and discuss some general aspects of systems with self - generated motion , with particular emphasis on the assumptions involved in adopting the standard theory of phoresis .",
    "section [ sec_diff_phor_velocity ] is devoted to the computation of the diffusiophoretic velocity .",
    "this includes the calculation of the diffusiophoretic slip velocity and the determination of the phoretic hydrodynamic flows and density profiles of the product molecules around a self - propelling particle .",
    "the results are discussed in section [ discussion ] , and we conclude in section [ summary ] with a brief summary of our results and general conclusions .",
    "important details of our calculations are presented in the appendices [ app_a ] , [ app_b ] , and [ app_c ] .",
    "the system we consider is shown in fig .",
    "it consists of an impermeable , spherical particle of radius @xmath0 with a point - like catalytic site ( black dot in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) on its surface , which promotes the chemical conversion of a surrounding solvent into product molecules of diameter @xmath1 ( small hatched circles in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the particle and the surrounding solution ( solvent plus the solute , i.e. , the product molecules ) of viscosity @xmath2 are enclosed in a concentric , impermeable , spherical shell of radius @xmath3 ( @xmath4 .",
    "an impermeable , spherical particle of radius @xmath0 with a point - like catalytic site at @xmath5 ( depicted as a black dot ) on its surface , enclosed by a concentric , impermeable , spherical wall of radius @xmath3 ( @xmath4 . the product molecules of diameter @xmath1 are shown as small horizontally hatched circles . ]    in general , such a chemical conversion of the solvent gives rise to several types of product molecules .",
    "here we shall focus on the particular case in which the chemical conversion of a solvent molecule ( @xmath6 ) leads to two molecules only ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) , one very similar in size and properties with the solvent itself ( @xmath9 ) , the other one ( @xmath8 ) different [ @xmath10 ; in the following this latter is denoted as `` product molecule '' and plays the role of a solute in the solvent .",
    "in other words , we consider a situation in which the net result of the chemical conversion can be approximated as the generation of a solute , solely , and the reaction does not lead to a solvent depletion near the catalytic site which otherwise would reduce the current of solvent towards the catalytic site acting as a solvent sink .",
    "for example , this is approximately the case for the pt catalyzed decomposition of hydrogen peroxide ( h@xmath11o@xmath11 ) in aqueous solution into water ( h@xmath11o ) and oxygen ( o@xmath11 ) molecules , as discussed in refs . .",
    "in these experimental studies the oxygen plays the role of the product molecule the properties of which differ significantly from those of the solvent . here",
    "the solvent is actually a binary liquid mixture of h@xmath11o and h@xmath11o@xmath11 for which h@xmath11o is passive and does not participate in the chemical conversion .",
    "we note that actually it is rather difficult to assess whether or not h@xmath11o and h@xmath11o@xmath11 can be treated as being the same in such systems , and probably the answer would be on a case by case basis .",
    "this is not only because the h@xmath11o - particle and h@xmath11o@xmath11-particle interactions may be quite different for different materials ( the simplest example is exactly the catalytic decomposition of h@xmath11o@xmath11 on pt ) , but also because of the sensitivity of phoresis to the details of the _ solvent mediated _ interactions  and the weakly acidic nature of h@xmath11o@xmath11 may play an important role here . in providing this example as a possible realization of a catalyzed reaction @xmath12 we had to rely on : ( i ) the statement in ref .",
    "[ second entry , bottom of left column on page 13427 therein ] , which is based on some previously published results by phibbs and gigure @xcite , that hydrogen peroxide and water in contact with au have almost identical interfacial tensions ( this translates into similar particle - solvent interactions ) , and thus that there is no additional solvent - density gradient to be considered , and ( ii ) on the implicit statement in the same ref .",
    "[ second entry , eq .",
    "( 8) therein ] that the effective interaction of the o@xmath11 molecule with the au surface of the rod does not depend on the composition of the solvent h@xmath11o - h@xmath11o@xmath11 mixture .",
    "we thus assume that the reaction at the catalytic site , ( located at @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the unit vector of the @xmath15-axis ) , acts effectively only as a point - like source of product molecules @xcite of diameter @xmath1 which are diffusing in the solvent with diffusion coefficient @xmath16 . in passing we note that this is in contrast to the situation considered in ref . , where the catalytic site acts both as a source for the product and as a sink for the solvent , i.e. , the generation of a product molecule is accompanied by the annihilation of a solvent one so that @xmath17 which implies that @xmath8 can only be a different configuration of @xmath6 , because it must have the same chemical constituents . in the situation considered here ,",
    "the amplitude of the production rate of @xmath8 is denoted as @xmath18 .",
    "we shall neglect any interaction between the product molecules .",
    "thus the number density of product molecules is considered to be so low that among themselves they behave like an ideal gas .",
    "there is an interaction potential between the product molecules and the moving particle ( see appendix [ app_a ] ) , which includes the impermeability condition at the surface of particle .",
    "the interactions between the product molecules and the solvent are accounted for in an effective way via the stokes - einstein expression @xmath19 for the diffusion coefficient @xmath16 of the product molecules @xcite , where @xmath20 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath21 is the temperature .",
    "the presence of a source of solute ( product molecules ) on the surface of the particle creates a non - uniform and time dependent distribution of solute in the solution ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , i.e. , a non - uniform composition of the solution . because the understanding of the way in which such a non - uniform composition gives rise to phoretic motion is not straightforward , we discuss here in some detail how the general model introduced in section [ general ] can be put into the context of the standard theory of phoresis @xcite .",
    "a recent clear exposition of the basic concepts and a discussion of different phoretic transport scenarios can be also found in ref . .",
    "if the production rate of the source is not very large and the diffusion coefficient of the product molecules through the solvent is not too small , the solute density varies smoothly in space and slowly in time .",
    "this justifies the assumption of local equilibrium and the definition of a position- and time - dependent chemical potential of the solution ( the spatial gradients of which describe the diffusion of the solute away from the source ) . in a quasi steady - state of the solution , corresponding to slow time - variations of the composition ,",
    "the net solute current is approximately zero and the solute density gradients are balanced by pressure gradients [ see also eq .",
    "( b3 ) in ref . ] .",
    "because in the absence of external body forces the mechanical equilibrium for a liquid solution is generally established much faster than the chemical one ( see , e.g. , ref . ) , it is physically plausible to assume that _ far from the boundaries _",
    "( i.e. , far from the wall and far from the particle surface ) the pressure adjusts instantaneously to accommodate the spatially varying solute density profile @xcite and keeps varying slowly with time ( on time scales much larger than the diffusion time @xmath22 ) because the overall density of the solution increases in time . in other words , the pressure is determined by the solute density profile and is obtained from the equation of state of the solvent - solute binary mixture considered as a thermodynamic system in local equilibrium described by the corresponding free energy density .",
    "clearly , the situation is different in the region of contact between the solution and the particle surface ( and also of contact with the wall ) where the interactions of the particle with the product molecules ( solute ) and with the solvent molecules are relevant .",
    "this interaction disturbs the distribution of solute molecules , net currents of solute and solvent result , and the pressure field becomes a quantity determined by the incompressibility requirement for the hydrodynamic flow , and not by an equation of state .",
    "we shall discuss this important point below .    at a given time",
    "the spatial variations of the number density @xmath23 of the solute and of the number density @xmath24 of the solvent are characterized as follows : @xmath24 is constant throughout the solution apart from the close vicinity of the particle surface and of the surface of the confining sphere .",
    "there @xmath24 vanishes and reaches its constant bulk value via density oscillations which are induced by local packing effects caused by the finite diameter @xmath25 of the solvent particles .",
    "away from any kind of surface phase transition the approach of the bulk value occurs exponentially on the scale of the bulk correlation length @xmath26 of the solvent .",
    "( the presence of long - ranged dispersion forces causes power - law decays ; however , their amplitude is small and is neglected in the present context . ) away from bulk phase transitions @xmath26 is comparable with the range of the interaction potential between the solvent molecules , which in turn is proportional to @xmath25 with a prefactor of order unity . within this picture @xmath24",
    "does not vary along the surface of the particle .    the solute number density @xmath23 is characterized by two important features . on the scale of the system size @xmath27",
    ", @xmath23 varies due to the diffusion process . on the much smaller length scale of the solute diameter @xmath1",
    ", @xmath23 also varies near the particle surface and near the surface of the confinement as discussed above for the solvent . since , however , according to our earlier assumption the solute particles can be considered to form an ideal gas , near the walls @xmath23 varies proportional to @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the _ effective _ substrate potential ( see appendix [ app_a ] ) in the sense that it describes the interaction of the solute molecule with the substrate in the presence of the solvent , and @xmath30",
    ". typically the range @xmath31 of @xmath29 is proportional to the solute diameter @xmath1 . accordingly",
    "the solute molecules interact directly with the particle only if they are within a thin surface film of thickness @xmath31 , which is assumed to not be deformed by the motion of the particle @xcite .",
    "the standard theory of phoresis assumes @xmath32 so that within this surface film of thickness @xmath31 the solvent can be considered as a continuum with constant @xmath24 .",
    "we note that this assumption is rather convenient from a computational point of view .",
    "however , this assumption is at odds with the basic underlying model according to which the solute particle is created from a solvent particle via a catalytic reaction . under these circumstances",
    "one expects @xmath33 ( see the above example of the reaction @xmath34 h@xmath11o@xmath11 @xmath35 @xmath34 h@xmath11o + o@xmath11 ) . in the absence of a more detailed theory of phoresis , which treats the sizes of the solvent and solute particles on the same footing , we proceed along the lines of the standard theory .",
    "nonetheless we point out that there is an urgent need for improvement",
    ". it might be that due to the fact that continuum hydrodynamics remains quantitatively reliable down to surprisingly small length scales ( here @xmath25 ) , it is conceivable that the aforementioned continuum description yields reliable results , too .",
    "but this remains unproven .",
    "according to the standard theory a hydrodynamic description applies within the aforementioned surface film .",
    "within this picture the solute molecules and their effective interaction with the particle are replaced by a corresponding distribution of `` point forces '' acting on the solvent in the film . within the limitations of such an approach the hydrodynamic description of the solution naturally splits into that of an `` inner '' region formed by the surface film and that of the `` outer '' region formed by the exterior space beyond the surface film .",
    "following refs .",
    ", the ensuing asymmetric , non - uniform solute number density @xmath36 around the particle will give rise , _ within the surface film only _",
    ", to a pressure gradient along the surface of the particle .",
    "this is because the surface film is very thin on the scale of the system size @xmath0 so that the equilibration of the composition profile of the solution within the surface film can be assumed to be fast along the direction normal to the surface of the self - propelling particle compared with the diffusional relaxation time of the composition gradient along its surface , which typically involves a length scale of the order of the particle size @xmath0 . therefore , within the surface film the solute density in the direction normal to the surface of the particle is given by a boltzmann distribution corresponding to the local equilibrium configuration in the presence of the effective interaction potential between the particle and the solute molecules , with a prefactor which depends on the position along the surface of the particle ( for details see appendix [ app_a ] , which builds on ref . ) .",
    "mechanical equilibrium of the solvent within the surface film along the direction normal to the surface of the particle ( no flow along this direction ) requires the pressure gradient along the normal to be equal to the body force densities due to the effective particle - solute interactions .",
    "therefore the pressure within the surface film differs from the `` outer '' pressure field by an `` osmotic pressure '' term , i.e. , a term proportional to the extra solute density @xmath23 in excess to the constant solvent density @xmath24 .",
    "since this osmotic pressure varies along the surface of the particle , there is a gradient of pressure along the surface of the particle .",
    "this lateral pressure gradient is not balanced by any body force and thus generates shear stress within the surface film .",
    "therefore it induces hydrodynamic flow of the solution along the surface of the particle and entails motion of the particle with a velocity @xmath37 . because the system has azimuthal symmetry , the motion is along the @xmath15-axis , i.e. , @xmath38 .",
    "the hydrodynamic flow of the solution , the diffusive transport of the solute , and the coupling between the two giving rise to phoretic motion of the particle are analyzed in detail in the next section ( see also the appendices [ app_a]-[app_c ] ) .",
    "our calculation of the diffusiophoretic velocity proceeds along the lines of ref . and is based on dividing the problem into an inner one  within the film around the particle surface discussed in subsec .",
    "[ sec_standard_phoresis ] , and an outer one  beyond the range of the effective interaction between the solutes and the particle . in view of the arguments presented in sec .",
    "[ model ] , we base our analysis on the following assumptions:(i ) the chemical reaction leads to a change in the solute density only .",
    "the thickness of the surface film , defined by the range of the effective interaction between the product molecules ( solute ) and the particle , is much smaller than the particle radius @xmath0 .",
    "the spatial variations of the solute number density along the surface of the particle occur over length scales of the order of @xmath0 , which allows one to use the approximation of a locally planar interface .",
    "( ii ) the number density of product molecules is sufficiently low , so that the solute can be viewed as an ideal gas and the solvent - solute mixture behaves like an ideal dilute solution . in this case , the pressure gradient is simply proportional to the gradient of the number density of the product particles ( see appendix [ app_a ] ) .",
    "( iii ) temporal variations of the number density of the product molecules due to their creation occur on time scales much longer than those needed for the fluid flow ( as seen from the moving particle ) to relax to a steady state corresponding to the number density profile at that moment .",
    "( iv ) the flow field of the solution within the surface film can be described by the laws of hydrodynamics .",
    "additionally , we assume that both the reynolds number @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the _ mass density _ of the solvent , and the peclet number @xmath41 are small , such that one can approximate the hydrodynamic description with the creeping flow ( stokes ) equations and disregard the convection of the solute compared to its diffusive transport . here",
    "we have assumed that the magnitude of the hydrodynamic flow @xmath42 is similar to that of the phoretic velocity @xmath43 ; this assumption is supported _ a posteriori _ by the fact that for our system the phoretic velocity is basically the average of the slip - velocity over the surface of the particle [ see , c.f . , eqs .",
    "( [ slip_vel ] ) and ( [ velocity ] ) ] . for a @xmath2 m size particle moving through water ( density @xmath44 , viscosity @xmath45 ) with a velocity of the order of @xmath2 m/s , which is typical for phoresis",
    ", one has @xmath46 . for the diffusion at room temperature ( @xmath47 j ) of o@xmath11 ( @xmath48 m ) in h@xmath11o@xmath11 ( @xmath49 ) ,",
    "the stokes - einstein relation leads to an estimate @xmath50 for the diffusion coefficient ( in agreement with ref . ) , and thus @xmath51 . therefore the latter assumptions are justified .",
    "note that if one uses @xmath52 rather than @xmath0 as a characteristic length scale , the above results imply that the @xmath53 and @xmath54 numbers remain both very small as long as @xmath55 .      as discussed in sec .",
    "[ model ] , the pressure gradient along the surface of the particle , induced by its interaction with the non - uniform distribution @xmath36 of product molecules , leads to flow of the solution relative to the particle .",
    "as shown in appendix [ app_a ] , the hydrodynamic flow within the surface film translates into a ( phoretic ) slip - velocity , @xmath56 at the outer edge @xmath57 of the surface film as a boundary condition for the hydrodynamic flow in the outer region . in this equation",
    "@xmath58 denotes the projection of the gradient operator onto the tangential planes of the surface of the particle , @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the polar and azimuthal unit vectors , respectively , while @xmath62 is an effective `` mobility '' , and @xmath63 is a characteristic length scale .",
    "the latter is determined by the effective interaction potential @xmath29 between the particle and the product molecules @xcite [ which determines their distribution within the surface film along the direction @xmath64 normal to the particle surface within the local coordinate system ( fig .",

    "in which the particle moves with a yet unknown velocity @xmath70 , the hydrodynamic flow @xmath71 at time @xmath72 in the domain beyond the surface film around the particle obeys the steady - state force - free stokes equations @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the pressure tensor , @xmath75 is the hydrostatic pressure , and @xmath76 is the shear stress tensor , i.e. , @xmath77 , subject to boundary conditions ( bc ) of no - slip at the wall at @xmath52 and prescribed slip velocity on the surface @xmath78 , i.e. , @xmath79 note that the parametric dependences of the flow field @xmath42 on @xmath72 and @xmath80 stem from the boundary conditions . note that because for the outer problem the variations of the flow field and those of the number density of the product molecules are over length scales that are much larger than @xmath31 , one can replace everywhere in the calculations the ( unknown ) value of @xmath78 by @xmath0 ; we shall use this approximation in the following .",
    "the solution of the stokes equations with boundary conditions on spherical surfaces is based on expressing both the flow field @xmath81 and the pressure field @xmath75 as series of solid harmonics @xcite @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) , which are the eigenfunctions of the _",

    "this deserves further discussion .",
    "( [ bc_flow ] ) the bc is that @xmath81 at the surface of the moving particle , i.e. , @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the position of the particle center , takes the value @xmath86 .",
    "as long as @xmath87 , concentricity holds and one obtains the first of the two bcs given by eq .",
    "( [ bc_flow ] ) .",
    "if , however , the velocity @xmath88 is not small , we readjust the center of @xmath52 in order to impose concentricity using the following `` protocol '' : the particle is allowed to move for a short time @xmath89 with the instantaneous velocity @xmath37 while the spherical shell at @xmath52 is fixed , after which the spherical shell is displaced by @xmath90 to its new fixed position in such a way that it does not perturb significantly the density and flow fields ; this procedure is then repeated .",
    "it is not clear to which extent this latter assumption , which allows us to obtain an analytical solution , can be realized experimentally .",
    "but it is expected that the results we derive for the present geometrical setup are relevant also for more general geometries @xcite , such as a particle moving along a channel in _",
    "3d _ , for which the constraint that the confinement moves with the particle is not needed .",
    "we note that in the general case of a non - spherical particle , or of a particle with non - uniform surface properties ( e.g. , a spatially varying effective mobility @xmath91 ) the particle can also rotate and the bc at the particle surface , eq . ( [ bc_flow ] ) , should include a term accounting for a rigid - body rotation with angular velocity @xmath92 . however ,",
    "this angular velocity turns out to be identically zero in the case of a spherical particle with an effective mobility @xmath91 which is constant on its surface @xcite ; therefore we completely disregard it here .",
    "the velocity @xmath70 of the particle is obtained by requiring that the hydrodynamic force @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the radial unit vector and @xmath95 the surface area element on the spherical surface @xmath96 ( note that we replaced @xmath78 by @xmath0 , as discussed in the previous subsection ) , exerted by the fluid on the composite domain particle plus surface film vanishes [ see the vector identities in eq .",

    "this is again due to the fact that there are no net forces acting on the object composed of the particle and its surface film .",
    "the above argument for determining the velocity @xmath43 has been discussed in detail by anderson ( see ref . and references therein ) , but it is often overlooked and replaced by the incorrect argument of a balance between a drag force - i.e. , the integral of the non - uniform osmotic pressure proportional to the density of solute ( see appendix [ app_a ] ) - exerted on the particle and a stokes - like viscous friction from the solvent ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "it is important to realize that the occurrence of composition gradients in the solution does not give rise , by itself , to an osmotic pressure ( see also ref . ) , in contrast to such an assumption made in ref . .",
    "such gradients will simply lead to diffusion of the product molecules , while the pressure in the solvent will adjust to accommodate the spatially varying chemical potential corresponding to the quasi - stationary density profile ( mildly time dependent due to the overall increase of the solute number density , in the case of the confined system ) , reflecting mechanical equilibrium @xcite . as a matter of fact , the origin of this osmotic pressure resides in the interaction between the particle and the product molecules , i.e.",
    ", it requires the explicit consideration of the effective interaction potential between the particle and the product molecule ( for a detailed illuminating discussion of this point see refs . ) . an intuitive argument that the use of such a `` stokes - formula '' , which stems from a standard `` drag balanced by viscous friction '' type of reasoning , is incorrect can be formulated as follows . at distances",
    "far from the particle the flow field should look like that produced by the superposition of a point force @xmath101 at the origin , i.e. , the center of the particle , which is the integrated ( over the particle surface ) effective `` product molecules on particle '' interaction ( the forces @xmath102 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] in appendix [ app_a ] ) , and a distribution of effective point forces oriented radially ( of the particle acting on the product molecules ) in a small shell region around the surface of the particle ( which is the aforementioned surface film ) , which upon integration gives exactly @xmath103 .",
    "note that for repulsive effective interactions and for an axisymmetric distribution of product molecules with an increasing density towards the source at @xmath104 , as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , @xmath105 is oriented into the positive @xmath15-direction ; for attractive interactions , @xmath101 would be oriented into the negative @xmath15-direction . this can be seen as follows . for repulsive interactions ,",
    "each of the forces @xmath102 is oriented radially inwards ; since the density of the product molecules is increasing towards the source located on the lower hemisphere , the magnitude and the projection onto the @xmath15-direction of the force due to the domain @xmath106 located at any @xmath107 is smaller than the one in the corresponding domain @xmath106 located at @xmath108 .",
    "thus the contribution into the positive @xmath15-direction from the lower hemisphere will dominate .",
    "for attractive interactions , the argument is simply reversed .",
    "this is in accordance with the following two statements regarding the characteristics of the far - field ( i.e. , on length scales over which the particle plus surface film are seen as point - like ) hydrodynamic flow : ( i ) in the absence of external body forces such as gravity or centrifugal forces the motion of the particle plus its surface film is net force free .",
    "( ii ) the generated flow corresponds , within a first approximation , to that produced by a `` force dipole '' [ which is the superposition of a distribution of `` force dipoles '' ( @xmath102 acting on the center and @xmath109 on the product molecules in @xmath110 ) as in fig . [ fig3 ] in appendix [ app_a ] ] , or a higher order `` force multipole '' , e.g. , quadrupole ( if it happens that the net force dipole vanishes , too ) @xcite at the origin , i.e. , the position of the center of the particle , rather than to the one due to a point force , which would be the case for an object uniformly dragged against the viscous stokes friction ( see , e.g. , ref . ) . for an unbounded system ,",
    "these forces translate into a radial decay of the phoretic flow field proportional to @xmath111 ( force dipole ) or @xmath112 ( force quadrupole ) , in contrast to the decay proportional to @xmath113 corresponding to a point force ; for a bounded system , the differences between the flow fields can not be any longer summarized by such a simple criterion as different power laws for the radial decay , but they remain significant nevertheless .",

    "for example , within the standard theory of phoresis the perturbation of the steady - state , externally controlled concentration gradient is induced by the interaction with the surface of the particle _ upon _ immersion .",

    "the main conclusion from this part of our work is that the development of a microscopic model for the dynamics in the surface film , eventually along the lines of ref . which treats the solvent and the solute molecules on equal footing , seems to be very important .    within the confines of the standard theory of phoresis",
    ", we have shown that the presence of a confining wall for the solvent and for the reaction product emerging from a catalytic site on the surface of a dissolved particle leads to a significant increase of the velocity of the self - propelled particle .",
    "this results from two competing effects : an increase of the solute density gradients along the surface of the particle and a simultaneous increase of the hydrodynamic viscous friction .",
    "the former one dominates . if only steric repulsion between the particle and the product molecules is present , the absolute value of the velocity is expected to remain , in general , rather small .",
    "a direct experimental realization of the co - moving geometry considered here seems to be difficult .",
    "but the results which we have derived are expected to be applicable ( at least qualitatively ) for more general geometries ( see ref . ) , such as the motion of spherical particles along cylindrical tubes . in this sense ,",
    "an experimental test of our results may be possible .",
    "further extensions may focus on new phenomena emerging from more complicated geometries , as well as from relaxing the assumption of no interaction between the product molecules . by taking into account the actual finite size of the product molecules and by considering generic chemical reactions ,",
    "in which the reaction products are indeed different from the solvent molecules , it is expected that the production of such solute particles is accompanied by a non - uniform depletion of the solvent around the particle .",
    "thus in general the motion of the particle will be determined by the gradients in both the solvent and the solute ( see also ref . ) .",
    "moreover , such a depletion zone would also lead to a decrease of the production rate of the catalytic site and consequently , to a reduction of the density gradients .",
    "accordingly one might expect that there are optimal values for the reaction rates for which the phoretic velocity is maximal .",
    "the interaction between the product molecules may play a significant role , and this deserves further discussion .",
    "if the density of the product particles is not low ( which is reasonable to expect at least near the catalytic reaction sites , for fast reactions , and for slow diffusion of product particles ) and the ( solvent - mediated ) solute - solute interactions have attractive or repulsive components longer ranged than the hard - core interaction discussed above , several other effects have to be carefully considered , especially if they are as important as the particle - solute interactions . in this case , the distribution of the solute particles in the direction normal to the surface of the big particle is no longer given by eq .",
    "( [ boltzmann ] ) , but it is determined both by the particle - solute interactions and by the contributions of the solute - solute interactions , the latter depending on the whole distribution of solute particles around the big particle . thus it becomes a complicated non - local problem which can not be easily addressed analytically . within a mean - field approximation , one may still assume that eq .",
    "( [ boltzmann ] ) holds if the potential is modified to include an averaged , effective solute - solute interaction .",
    "it is evident that even such a simplistic approach will lead to a different expression for the phoretic - slip velocity , and thus one can reasonably expect qualitative differences compared to the predictions of the classic theory of phoresis .",
    "moreover , the solute - solute interactions will lead to a dynamics which differs from simple diffusion and is determined , roughly speaking , by the density- and interaction - dependent collective diffusion coefficient . for example , attractive solute - solute interactions will lead to a tendency of `` clustering '' and thus will hinder the relaxation of the solute gradients , which intuitively would lead to an increase in the velocity of the particle , while repulsive interactions will help to dissipate the particle gradients and , intuitively , would lead to a decrease in the velocity . however , such intuitive arguments for changes in the velocity have to be carefully considered because , e.g. , it is not clear if in the presence of significant solute - solute interactions the assumption of an ultrathin `` unpolarized '' surface film still holds .",

    "<S> we study theoretically the effects of spatial confinement on the phoretic motion of a dissolved particle driven by composition gradients generated by chemical reactions of its solvent , which are active only on certain parts of the particle surface . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the presence of confining walls increases in a similar way both the composition gradients and the viscous friction , and the overall result of these competing effects is an increase in the phoretic velocity of the particle . for the case of steric repulsion only between the particle and the product molecules of the chemical reactions , </S>",
    "<S> the absolute value of the velocity remains nonetheless rather small . </S>"
