    "a point @xmath18 such that @xmath22 is contained in @xmath23 is called an _ exit point _ of @xmath3 , and the corresponding density an _ exit density_. the following figure shows the supports of a measure in @xmath24 and of a measure in @xmath20 . in the case of @xmath24 ,",
    "the boundary of @xmath13 is indicated by a dotted line , while for @xmath20 the triangle is colored light gray .",

    "the two supports pictured above have three attachment points each .    a measure @xmath25 is said to be _ rigid _ if there is no other measure @xmath26 with the same exit points and same exit densities as @xmath3 .",

    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : weight - trace - etc ]",
    "we describe some basic properties of measures , as well as the duality @xmath42 .",
    "this material is contained , more or less explicitly , in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "section [ sec : rigidity - homology ] begins with the mechanics of decomposing rigid measures into their extremal summands , and a linear algebraic consequence of this decomposition .",
    "theorem [ thm : secondary ] shows how our main result reduces to calculating the dimension of a certain convex set .",
    "its proof requires the study of measures obtained by immersing a tree ( section [ sec : immersions - of - trees ] ) and of the small perturbations of such immersions ( section [ sec : perturbations ] ) .",
    "we conclude the paper with an illustration of the main result .",
    "the role of measures in the study of the littlewood - richardson rule and in the intersection theory of grassmannians was first pointed out in @xcite .",
    "the extremal structure of rigid measures was described in @xcite , where it was shown how the associated intersections of schubert varieties can be written explicitly .",
    "rigid extremal measures have an underlying tree structure which was described in @xcite , and which also plays a role in this paper .",
    "we should observe that for integer values of @xmath12 , the set @xmath24 used in this paper is not the same as its namesake in @xcite and @xcite . indeed , in those papers the branch points are always of the form @xmath43 with integer @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "this hypothesis is natural when dealing with intersection problems , but the arguments of @xcite do not depend on it in an essential manner .",
    "consider a measure @xmath25 for some @xmath46 .",
    "we begin by establishing two identities .",
    "the first one ( [ eq : omega - def ] ) allows us to define the weight of @xmath3 , while ( [ eq : trace - identity ] ) is the trace identity which plays an important role in our arguments .",
    "equation ( [ eq : balance - tension ] ) is equivalent to@xmath47 and therefore@xmath48 where the sum is extended over all the branch points of @xmath3 .",
    "assume that @xmath9 and @xmath49 are two branch points such that the segment @xmath50 contains no other branch points of @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath50 is a positive multiple of @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is the density of @xmath3 on @xmath50 , then @xmath53 , so that these two terms will cancel out in the sum above .",
    "the only remaining terms correspond therefore to the exit densities of @xmath3 .",
    "denote by @xmath54 the exit densities in the direction of @xmath51 .",
    "we deduce that@xmath55w_{j}=0,\\ ] ] which in turn implies@xmath56 the common value of these sums is called the _ weight _ of @xmath3 , and will be denoted @xmath57 .",
    "there is another identity involving exit densities , which we will call the _ trace identity _ because of its connection with traces of matrices .",
    "one way to deduce it is to observe that an arbitrary measure @xmath27 represents the second differences of a convex function on @xmath1 .",
    "more precisely , there exists a ( necessarily continuous ) convex function @xmath58 with the following property : for any two equilateral triangles @xmath59 whose interiors do not intersect the support of @xmath3 , we have@xmath60 it suffices , of course , to require this condition for triangles whose sides are parallel to the vectors @xmath51 . thus , the function @xmath61 is affine on each connected component in the complement of the support of @xmath3 , and the piecewise constant function @xmath62 jumps at the points where the line @xmath63 intersects the support of @xmath3 transversally , the amount of each jump being equal to the density at the intersection point .",
    "it is easily seen that condition ( [ eq : balance - tension ] ) ensures that the various affine pieces of @xmath61 fit together around each branch point of @xmath3 .",
    "the function @xmath61 is uniquely determined by its values at three non collinear points ; these values can be prescribed arbitrarily .",
    "we will write @xmath64 to indicate this relationship between @xmath61 and @xmath3 . in the terminology of @xcite and @xcite , @xmath65 ( or its restriction to @xmath13 )",
    "hive_.    assume now that @xmath25 has exit densities @xmath66 in the direction of @xmath51 , @xmath67 , and the corresponding exit points are @xmath68 .",
    "denote by @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 the vertices of @xmath13 .",
    "the points @xmath68 are on the segment @xmath72 .",
    "we will denote by @xmath73 the distance from @xmath68 to @xmath74 .",
    "the number @xmath75 $ ] will also be called the _ coordinate _ of @xmath68 .",
    "consider now a convex function @xmath61 such that @xmath64 .",
    "the function @xmath76 jumps by @xmath77 at @xmath78 , and therefore@xmath79 where @xmath80 for @xmath81 .",
    "the function @xmath61 can be chosen so that it is identically zero in the angle bounded by @xmath82 and @xmath83 . in this case , we have @xmath84 and @xmath85 , so that adding the above identities for @xmath86 yields the _ _ trace identity__@xmath87 let us observe that the exit point @xmath68 is an attachment point of @xmath3 precisely when its coordinate @xmath73 is not zero .",
    "thus , only attachment points contribute significantly to the sum in the left hand side .",
    "next we discuss the dual of a measure @xmath25 . for this purpose",
    ", we construct the _ puzzle _ of @xmath88 as follows .",
    "we translate the connected components of the complement @xmath89 away from each other in such a way that the parallelogram formed by the two translates of a side @xmath50 in the support of @xmath3 has two sides which are @xmath90 clockwise from @xmath50 , and have length equal to the density of @xmath3 on @xmath50 .",
    "condition ( [ eq : balance - tension ] ) ensures that these pieces fit together .",
    "there is a polygon , corresponding to each branch point , which is not covered by these pieces , and which has sides equal to the densities of the segments meeting at that point .",
    "this process is illustrated below , where the white areas are the translated components of @xmath89 , the connecting parallelograms are dark gray , and the polygons corresponding to branch points are light gray .",
    "the solid lines in the first picture represent the support of @xmath3 , and all of them are taken to have the same density for this figure .",
    "the three kinds of pieces ( white , dark gray parallelograms and light gray ) form the puzzle of @xmath3 , and the process of passing from a measure to its puzzle is called _",
    "inflation_. the puzzle pieces cover an equilateral triangle with side @xmath91 which can , and generally will , be assumed to be precisely @xmath92 . we can now apply a dual process of * -_deflation _ to this puzzle as follows .",
    "consider a parallelogram @xmath93 formed by the two translates @xmath94 of a side in the support of @xmath3 .",
    "replace this parallelogram with a line segment congruent to @xmath95 , and assign to this segment a density equal to the length of @xmath50 .",
    "perform this operation for all dark gray parallelograms , and discard the white pieces of the puzzle .",
    "we obtain this way the restriction to @xmath96 of a measure @xmath97 , called the _ dual _ of @xmath3 . for the particular measure considered above",
    ", the support of the dual measure is pictured below .",
    "the densities are again equal on all edges in the support .",
    "the rigidity of a measure is equivalent to a geometric property of its puzzle .",
    "orient all the edges of the dark gray parallelograms in the puzzle of @xmath3 so that they point away from the acute angles . as shown in @xcite",
    ", @xmath3 is rigid if and only if the resulting oriented graph has no _ gentle _ cycle , i.e. a cycle with no sharp turns .",
    "the measure inflated above is not rigid , as demonstrated by the gentle cycle shown below .",
    "this characterization of rigidity easily implies that the dual of a rigid measure is also rigid .",
    "indeed , @xmath3 and @xmath35 have the same puzzle .",
    "consider a measure @xmath25 for some @xmath46 , and let @xmath50 and @xmath98 be two segments in the support of @xmath3 containing no branch points in their interior .",
    "we will write @xmath99 if one of the following two situations occurs :    1 .",
    "@xmath100 are collinear , and there is a segment @xmath101 with @xmath102 such that @xmath103 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath104 , and there is a segment @xmath101 collinear with @xmath50 such that @xmath103 .",
    "the relation @xmath99 always implies that the density of @xmath3 on @xmath98 is greater than or equal to the density on @xmath50 . more generally ,",
    "if @xmath105 are segments in the support of @xmath3 containing no branch points in their interior , we write @xmath106 if @xmath107 for @xmath108 . in this case , the segment @xmath109 is called a _ descendant _ of @xmath110 , and the sequence @xmath111",
    "is called a _",
    "descendance path_. the equivalence relation @xmath112 is defined by @xmath113 and @xmath114 ; in order to obtain an equivalence relation , we also allow @xmath115 .",

    "* section 3 ) in the case that @xmath3 is a rigid measure .    1 .",
    "if @xmath116 is in the support of @xmath3 and it is not a root edge , then there is at least one descendance path from a root edge to @xmath116 .",
    "moreover , all descendance paths give @xmath116 the same orientation .",
    "2 .   for each root edge @xmath50 , there exists a measure @xmath117 supported by the descendants of @xmath50 , with density one on @xmath50 .",
    "this measure @xmath118 is extremal , and it assigns integer densities to all edges . 3 .",

    "then we have @xmath122    thus the number of extremal summands of @xmath3 can be determined entirely from the geometry of the support of @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , any measure which has the same support as @xmath3 is rigid , and it can be written as @xmath123 for some positive constants @xmath124 .",
    "two extremal measures will be said to be _ inequivalent _ if neither of them is a multiple of the other ; this is equivalent to saying that the measures have different supports .",
    "the measures @xmath119 are mutually inequivalent since the root edge of @xmath121 is not in the support of @xmath125 for @xmath126 .",
    "[ pro : linear - indep]let @xmath25 be a rigid measure , and let @xmath127 be its attachment points .",

    "then the vectors @xmath131 are linearly independent .",
    "assume to the contrary that the vectors @xmath132 are linearly dependent .",
    "after a permutation of the measures , we may assume that there exist an integer @xmath133 , and nonnegative numbers @xmath134 such that @xmath135 and the measures @xmath136 have the same exit densities at all attachment points .",

    "the supports of these measures are contained in the support of @xmath3 , hence they are both rigid .",
    "we deduce that @xmath137 and this is a contradiction because the measure on the right hand side of this equation assigns zero density to some root edge of @xmath138 , unlike the left hand side .",
    "consider now two measures @xmath139 , and denote by @xmath140 the collection of all vertices of white puzzle pieces in @xmath13 determined by the support of @xmath3 .",
    "in other words , @xmath140 consists of the branch points and the exit points of @xmath3 , plus the corners of @xmath13 which are not exit points .",
