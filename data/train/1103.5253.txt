    "one of the basic requirements for implementing a physical qubit is the ability to faithfully measure its state @xcite .",
    "furthermore , qubit state detection must be performed with high fidelity to reach fault tolerant quantum computation .",
    "the exact detection error threshold required depends on many factors ; however under quite general assumptions error values on the order of @xmath2 were estimated @xcite .",
    "another important use of high - fidelity state detection is precision process tomography for studying different quantum processes .",
    "trapped ion qubits are a promising candidate system for physically realizing a quantum computer and serve as a convenient test - ground for studying fundamental quantum dynamics .",
    "ion species used for this purpose typically have a single electron in their valence shell and the two qubit states are encoded in two energy levels of the valence electron .",
    "state detection methods used so far rely on state - selective fluorescence . here",
    "photons are scattered from a laser that is resonant with a transition from one of the qubit states to a short - lived excited state , whereas transitions from the other qubit state are largely off - resonance .",
    "state inference is then based on the detected photon statistics @xcite . to this end ,",
    "qubit choices with a large energy separation are advantageous .    for optical qubits , in which the two qubit states are separated by an optical transition , state detection fidelity as high as 0.9999 was demonstrated using state - selective florescence and accounting for photon arrival times @xcite . another detection scheme , using repetitive quantum nondemolition measurements on an ancila ion - qubit ,",
    "was shown to give a fidelity of 0.9994 @xcite .",
    "optical qubits , however , have the disadvantage of an excited state lifetime on the order of one second , depending on the exact ion species used . furthermore , the linewidth of even ultra - stable optical local oscillators , i.e. , frequency stabilized lasers , would limit the dephasing time of an optical qubit .",
    "qubits that are encoded into a pair of levels in the electronic ground state , in which the two qubit levels are split , either by the zeeman effect or the hyperfine interaction , by radio - frequency transitions , have practically an infinite lifetime , as well as a very long coherence time @xcite .",
    "hyperfine qubit levels are typically separated by frequencies in the ghz range .",
    "state detection for this type of qubit can still be implemented by direct state - selective fluorescence , since the typical linewidth of electric - dipole transitions is two orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "here , off - resonance scattering normally limits state detection fidelity to below 0.995 @xcite . the use of ancila qubits can , in principle , increase the detection fidelity of a hyperfine ion - qubit @xcite . in ion species that have low - lying meta - stable levels ,",
    "one of the qubit states can be shelved to a meta - stable level prior to detection . here",
    "detection fidelity is similar to that of an optical qubit with an additional error introduced by the state shelving process .",
    "using state selective optical pumping for shelving , a hyperfine ion - qubit measurement fidelity as high as 0.9977 was demonstrated .",
    "@xcite .",
    "ion - qubits that are encoded into a pair of zeeman split levels pose the hardest state - measurement challenge .",
    "this is because the frequency separation between the qubit levels is typically in the mhz range and is comparable to the spectral linewidth of electric - dipole transitions used for state - selective fluorescence . since direct state - selective fluorescence is impossible , zeeman qubits can be readout only by state mapping onto a hyperfine ancila qubit @xcite or by shelving one of the qubit states onto a meta - stable level . however , the fidelity of state shelving in a zeeman qubit using optical pumping is limited due to the strong coupling of the shelving light to the other qubit state @xcite .",
    "thus , the only way to state - selectively shelve a zeeman qubit with high fidelity is by using a narrow - linewidth laser .",
    "although there have been several reports on detecting a zeeman qubit with shelving via a narrow - linewidth laser , with typical fidelities below 0.996 @xcite , to our knowledge , there hasnt been a systematic study of the measurement error and limitations in this kind of qubit .    here",
    "we demonstrate the readout of a single - ion zeeman qubit with a fidelity of 0.9989(1 ) .",
    "spin state detection is performed via electron shelving with a narrow - linewidth diode laser , followed by state - selective fluorescence .",
    "we analyze the different fundamental sources as well as technical sources of measurement error in detail .",
    "further , we use the high - fidelity state detection of our qubit to demonstrate high - fidelity state tomography @xcite . here",
    ", we measure the fidelity of quantum state tomography averaged over all possible single qubit states and also fully characterize the detection process using quantum process tomography .",
    "we trap a single @xmath0 ion in a linear rf paul trap .",
    "the trapping potential is well approximated as harmonic with a secular axial frequency of @xmath3 , and two nearly degenerate radial frequencies of @xmath4 .",

    "a magnetic field of @xmath10 mt splits the two qubit levels by a frequency , @xmath11 mhz .",
    "an oscillating magnetic field , perpendicular to the quantization axis , is generated by a current , oscillating at @xmath12 , through an electrode positioned 2 mm from the ion , resulting in coherent coupling between the two qubit levels .",
    "zeeman qubit coherent rotations are therefore generated by oscillating current pulses .",
    "in the first part of state detection the electron is shelved from the @xmath6 state to one of the @xmath13 , zeeman - split , levels using a narrow linewidth , 674 nm , external cavity diode laser .",
    "the diode laser is stabilized to a high finesse ( @xmath14 ) , ultra - low expansion glass , reference cavity .",
    "residual frequency noise of the laser has three dominant spectral features .",
    "first , slow thermal drifts of the cavity result in drifts of the laser frequency with a typical magnitude of 10 hz / s .",
    "the atomic resonance frequency is scanned every two minutes to correct for this drift .",
    "second , intermediate frequency noise results in a laser line half - width of 70 hz over several seconds , estimated in a ramsey spectroscopy experiment @xcite . the third spectral feature results from fast frequency noise that is unsuppressed , or even slightly enhanced , by our frequency servo system .",
    "this spectral feature is often referred to as the servo bump .",
    "our servo bumps are centered around @xmath15 on both sides of the carrier , having a width of @xmath16 , and contain an estimated @xmath17 of the optical power . a detailed discussion of our narrow linewidth diode laser system is given in @xcite .",
    "in this experiment , the direction of 674 nm laser light propagation relative to the zeeman splitting magnetic field direction , limits the allowed transitions between @xmath18 and @xmath13 manifolds to @xmath19 transitions .",
    "electron shelving is followed by state - selective fluorescence detection on the @xmath20 transition at @xmath21 .",
    "photons that are scattered in a direction perpendicular to the 422 nm laser beam and the magnetic field are collected by an imaging system ( n.a .",

    "state inference relies on the detected photon statistics .",
    "qualitatively , a small number of detected photons implies that the ion qubit started in the @xmath6 state and was shelved to the non - fluorescing @xmath13 level , whereas a large number of detected photons implies that the ion qubit started in the @xmath7 state and therefore was not shelved and remained at the fluorescing @xmath18 level .",
    "following electron shelving , the number of photons @xmath22 , detected by the pmt during a given detection time , @xmath23 , is a random variable .",
    "this random variable is denoted by @xmath24 if the ion is in the fluorescing ( bright ) state @xmath18 , and @xmath25 if the ion is in the non - fluorescing ( dark ) state @xmath13 .",
    "photon detection events , which occur when the ion is in the dark state are primarily due to scattering of the laser beam from trap surfaces .",
    "the fidelity of state discrimination is compromised by the overlap of the probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) of these two random variables .",
    "state inference can be performed by introducing a threshold value for the number of photons detected , @xmath26 .",
    "if the number of photons detected is greater ( smaller ) than this threshold , @xmath27 , then we can infer that the ion is in the bright ( dark ) state .",
    "given the probability distribution functions for @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the errors in detecting the bright and dark states are @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively .",

    "the longer the detection time , the smaller is the overlap between the two pdfs and therefore also the detection error .",

    "shelving and initialization errors however , result from technical imperfections . in the following discussion",
    "we try to point out the dominant sources for this errors by calculating an order of magnitude estimates for the contribution of different possible error sources .",
    "a summary of this error budget is presented in table [ tab : errorbudget ] .",
    "the first stage of initialization consists of optical pumping to the @xmath6 state via the @xmath70 manifold .",
    "ideally , the optical pumping beam has to match a perfect @xmath67 polarization .",
    "otherwise , the matrix elements for the @xmath96 transitions will not null , and some population will be pumped out of the @xmath6 state . to this end",
    ", the wave - vector , @xmath97 , of the beam has to be exactly parallel to the external magnetic field and a perfect circular polarization is required .",
    "we found the fidelity of this initialization step in our setup to be limited to less than @xmath98 due to stress - induced birefringence in the fused silica vacuum chamber optical ports .    to increase initialization efficiency",
    ", we use the narrow linewidth @xmath1 laser to optically pump the remaining population from the @xmath7 state to the @xmath6 state via the @xmath99 level as described above .",
    "this initialization procedure is limited due to the finite off - resonance excitation probability on the @xmath100 transition , resulting in a finite probability for the electron to be in the @xmath7 state at the end of the process .",
    "note that there are two different contributions to off - resonant excitation .",
    "the first is coherent with respect to the resonant light component and is due to the pulse finite time .",
    "the second is incoherent and is due to the servo bumps . in steady state ,",
    "i.e. , after a sufficient number of pulses , this probability is given by the ratio of the @xmath101 and @xmath102 transfer probabilities .",
    "these are , in turn , estimated based on the off - resonance excitation rate , the polarization of the @xmath103 repump laser , and the different decay probabilities from the @xmath104 excited states to either the @xmath6 or @xmath7 states . the incoherent off - resonance excitation rate is directly measured and is seen to be very sensitive to the specific laser and servo - loop working parameters , such as current or gain ;",
    "we have observed this rate change by a factor of 2 when working with slightly different parameters . the coherent off - resonance excitation rate is estimated based on the measured rabi frequencies and detuning .",
    "we thus estimate the @xmath6 state initialization error to be @xmath105 due to coherent off - resonance excitation and @xmath106 due to incoherent off - resonance excitation .",
    "when initializing to the @xmath7 state , we initially perform optical pumping to the @xmath6 state and apply an rf @xmath74-pulse , which transfers the electron to the @xmath7 state with a fidelity higher than 0.999 .",
    "this procedure is followed by 10 similar pulses on the @xmath107 transition , which result in @xmath7 state initialization with the same error as for the @xmath6 state .",
    "note that another possible error in the initialization process could arise from leakage of @xmath108 laser light , resulting in mixing of the two qubit states .",

    "_ for the @xmath6 state , the shelving error is the probability that the ion remains in the @xmath18 manifold after shelving was performed .",
    "a number of factors contribute to this error .",
    "the shelving transition rabi frequency depends on the ions motion through the debye - waller factor .",
    "the temperature of the ion therefore has a large effect on the shelving error .",
    "the ion is initially doppler cooled to a mean axial harmonic oscillator number of @xmath62 .",
    "this leads to an error of @xmath112 in a single shelving @xmath74-pulse .",
    "it is important to note that in the second shelving pulse the error is increased to @xmath113 due to the change in the level occupation distribution induced by the first pulse ; following the first pulse , motional states with a smaller debye - waller factor are preferentially left at the @xmath18 level . to reduce this error , doppler cooling of the ion",
    "is followed by sideband cooling on the @xmath100 transition .",
    "after five ms cooling , a mean axial harmonic oscillator number of @xmath114 , inferred from the imbalance between the motional sidebands , is reached . yet",
    ", the mean harmonic oscillator level does not provide the full motional population distribution , which is required to estimate the shelving error .",
    "a thermal distribution with @xmath115 would lead to a shelving error equal to @xmath116 in the first pulse and @xmath117 in the second pulse .",
    "however , the distribution of high harmonic oscillator levels , following sideband cooling , is poorly described by a thermal distribution .",
    "this is because motional states outside the lamb - dicke regime have a small debye - waller factor on the cooling transition and therefore are not efficiently cooled .",
    "the exact dynamics of the sideband cooling process and the resulting energy level distribution are not calculated here . in our estimates",
    "we use the error values assuming a thermal distribution .",
    "this is probably an overly optimistic estimate and could be the source of the discrepancy between our evaluated and measured errors for the @xmath6 state .",
    "motion along the radial direction of the trap has a much weaker effect on shelving infidelity , because of the stronger confinement along this direction .",
    "however , while sideband cooling is performed for the axial motion , the radial motion is only doppler cooled and thus can not be neglected .",
    "we estimate the infidelity due to radial motion to be @xmath118 in the first pulse and @xmath119 in the second pulse .",
    "intensity fluctuations of the @xmath1 laser are reduced to a negligible level using an intensity noise eater .",
    "an effective residual intensity noise resulting from beam pointing fluctuations on the ion is estimated to give an error of @xmath120 in a single shelving pulse .",
    "magnetic field fluctuations are studied in a ramsey experiment on the @xmath121 transition , where a coherence time of @xmath122 is measured .",
    "the resulting errors are estimated by numerical solution of the optical bloch equations with a corresponding coherence decay term .",
    "taking into account the different magnetic field susceptibilities for the different transitions , as well as the different durations for the two shelving pulses , we estimate the errors to be @xmath123 and @xmath124 for the two @xmath74-pulses respectively .    a different contribution to the shelving error results from laser frequency noise .",
    "as detailed above , this noise has few spectral contributions .",
    "noises that are slow compared with the experiment time result in a typical laser frequency drift of two @xmath125 between consecutive scans of the atomic line , giving a shelving error of @xmath120 per pulse .",
    "the contribution of the laser linewidth to the decoherence rate is found in a ramsey experiment on the @xmath100 , yielding a coherence time of @xmath126 .",
    "after quadratically subtracting the contribution of magnetic field fluctuations to this decoherence rate , we estimate the error owing to the linewidth of the laser alone to be @xmath127 in a single shelving pulse .",
    "the finite decay probability from the @xmath13 level manifold during the shelving process also contributes to the @xmath6 state shelving error .",
    "this probability has two contributions .",

    ", the electron is found at the @xmath13 level with high probability and therefore it decays with rate @xmath128 during the second shelving pulse . during the first shelving pulse this error is half as large , because , on average , only half of the population is in the @xmath13 manifold .",
    "using pulse durations of @xmath76 and @xmath129 we estimate this effect to give a contribution of @xmath130 to the shelving error .",
    "the second contribution is due to off - resonant coupling of light to motional sidebands .",
    "this coupling results in population transfer from the @xmath13 manifold back to the @xmath6 state .",

    "we find the lifetime of the @xmath13 level to be consistent with @xcite , indicating that leakage of repump light has no significant effect .    summing up all the different contributions for the @xmath6 state shelving error after both @xmath74-pulses we get an error estimate equal to @xmath133 .",

    "in conclusion , we demonstrate high - fidelity state detection of a qubit encoded in the zeeman splitting of the ground state of a single @xmath0 ion . the limitations of the best effort readout fidelity of @xmath156 are analyzed in detail .",
    "our estimates of the contribution of imperfect state preparation and shelving to the measured error is @xmath157 .",
    "the remaining part , @xmath118 , results from limited state discrimination efficiency owing to the finite lifetime of the metastable level .",
    "this fraction of the error is intrinsic to our state detection scheme , and can be somewhat decreased if the information on photon detection times is used @xcite .    since one of the applications of high - fidelity state detection is performing high accuracy quantum process tomography we measured the averaged state tomography fidelity over the entire bloch sphere , which is @xmath158 .",
    "we also performed quantum process tomography for the detection process , and found the process fidelity to be @xmath159 .",
    "this fidelity can be further increased if higher fidelity qubit rotations are used .",
    "our measured state detection fidelity is compatible with recent estimates of the required fault - tolerance error threshold and can be used in the future to implement effective quantum error correction protocols .",
    "in addition , highly accurate quantum process tomography , important for studying basic quantum processes , can be implemented .",
