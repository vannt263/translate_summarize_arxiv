    "studying hadronic matter under extreme conditions of high temperature or density ( or both ) is the main proposal of experiments like alice at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and star at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) . the implementation of thermodynamic quantities in explaining the hadronization process in high - energy collisions dates back to more than six decades  @xcite . with the statistical bootstrap model ,",
    "hagedorn invented the concept of limiting temperature @xmath3  @xcite . beyond this value ,",
    "the hadronic matter is no longer stable .",
    "accordingly , a new question arises , what will happen if @xmath4 ?",
    "this was answered by cabibbo and parisi  @xcite .",
    "a new state of matter should be formed , the so called quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "indeed , the hagedorn temperature refers to the critical temperature related to the qgp - hadron phase transition .",
    "the heavy - ion collisions are conjectured as essential tools for creating qgp in laboratory .",
    "such created hot and dense partonic matter rapidly expands and cools down . on path of this evolution",
    ", it undergoes phase transition(s ) back to the hadronic matter .",
    "the particle ratios and transverse mass spectra are important phenomenological indications for the thermal origin of the hadronization at high energies .",
    "the particle ratios and/or yields are studied in the framework of thermal models which success to explain it at various energies .",
    "there are many versions of these thermal models which can be classified in different ways .",
    "depending on the degree of chemical non - equilibrium and/or the free parameters , the thermal models can be classified into _ fully _ and _ partially _ chemical equilibrium and _ non - equilibrium_.    * in _ fully _ chemical equilibrium  @xcite , only two parameters are used to fit the experimental particle ratios .",
    "they are @xmath5 and @xmath6 being the freeze - out temperature and the chemical potential , respectively . * in _ partially",
    "_ chemical equilibrium  @xcite , an additional parameter is assumed , @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "this parameter represents the degree of correctness of the assumption of the _ absolute _ chemical equilibrium . in other words",
    ", it measures whether strangeness production was saturated in the full available phase space .",
    "the strange quark phase space occupation factor , @xmath7 , was needed in elementary collisions like proton - proton ( pp )  @xcite and electron - positron ( @xmath8 )  @xcite . * in chemical _ non - equilibrium _",
    "@xcite , two additional parameters are assumed .",
    "they are @xmath9 and @xmath10 being strange quark and light quark phase space occupation factor , respectively .",
    "discussion on the possible physical meanings of these quantities can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "the three freeze - out parameters , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , are extracted from fits of the experimental particle ratios with the corresponding ratios calculated in the hrg model , i.e. , assuming partially chemical equilibrium .",
    "the experimental hadron ratios are limited to mid - rapidity central au - au collisions at energies ranging from @xmath11 @xmath12 to @xmath13gev .",
    "this wide range of energies offers a good opportunity to check the degree of non - equilibrium in the most central au - au collisions measured by star experiment at rhic energies .",
    "the reasons why we concentrate the study to the star have been elaborated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the results deduced in _ partially _ chemical equilibrium are compared with our previous study  @xcite , in which we assumed _ fully _ chemical equilibrium , i.e. @xmath14 . also , they are confronted to recent lattice quantum chromodynamics ( lqcd ) predictions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we shall discuss @xmath1 and @xmath2 ratios .",
    "these two particle ratios are especially sensitive to degree of non - equilibrium in strange particle production .",
    "finding out answers to the questions about the chemical equilibrium in this range of energy and the differences between the extracted parameters in partially and fully chemical equilibrium is the main goal of the present work , which is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : hrg ] elaborates details about the hrg model .",
    "the fits of the experimental ratios with the non - equilibrium hrg calculations are discussed in section [ sec : phys ] .",
    "section [ sec : res ] is devoted to the results and discussion .",
    "the conclusions and outlook shall be summarized in section [ cons ] .",
    "the hrg model was described by many authors  @xcite . here , we present a short summary with a special emphasis on partial chemical equilibrium . we starts with a partition function of a _",
    "free _ gas consisting of hadron resonances . the partition function can be used to obtain the thermodynamic quantities . in hadronic phase and assuming fully chemical equilibrium  @xcite [ eq : lnz1 ] z(t , , v)&=&_i z^1_i(t,_i , v)=_i_0^ p^2 dp ( 1 ) , where @xmath15 is the @xmath16th particle dispersion relation , @xmath17 is spin - isospin degeneracy factor and @xmath18 stands for bosons and fermions , respectively .",
    "the @xmath19-th particle chemical potential is given as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the baryon , strange and isospin quantum number , respectively .",
    "if we assume degree of the non - equilibrium , this can be implemented - among others - through the strange quark occupation factor @xmath7 [ eq : lnzallg ] z(t , , v,_s ) & = & _ i_0^ p^2 dp ( 1_s^s_i ) , where @xmath24 is the number of strange valence quarks and antiquarks in the @xmath19-th hadron . at finite temperature @xmath25 and chemical potential @xmath26",
    ", the pressure of the @xmath19-th hadron or resonance species reads @xmath27\\right).\\ ] ] as no phase transition is conjectured in hrg , summing over all hadron resonances results in the final thermodynamic pressure .",
    "accordingly , the number density can be obtained as [ eq : n_i ] n(t , , _",
    "s ) & = & _ i p(t,_i,_s ) .",
    "the conservations laws should be fulfilled through the chemical potentials and temperature and over the whole phase space .",
    "so , @xmath28 and @xmath29 can be calculated at a certain @xmath25 and @xmath6 .    during the expansion of the hadronic matter",
    ", we assume that inelastic interactions between resonances and annihilation processes  @xcite have negligible contributions in the final state .",
    "the main process at this stage is unstable resonance decay . with this regard",

    ". one of possible scenarios is based on some of these two mechanisms .",
    "nevertheless , the anomaly still there unsolved , in a solid way .",

    "we would like to stress that the details about hadron resonances mentioned above as well as the experimental ratio sets ( given in section [ sec : phys ] ) are the same as the ones used in our previous analysis  @xcite .",

    "[ tab:1 ] .",

    "slight improvements can not be seriously taken as a proof that the partially equilibrium is more suitable . *",
    "the freeze - out parameters deduced from the lattice qcd calculations show that the temperature is nearly constant at high energies , i.e. small chemical potentials  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", we found that the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 at fully chemical equilibrium@xcite are more consistent with the lattice qcd than the others extracted from partially chemical equilibrium ( @xmath66 ) , fig .",
    "[ fig : tmub_comp ] . here , the freeze - out parameters at partially chemical equilibrium ( @xmath66 ) are slightly larger than the ones at fully chemical equilibrium , especially temperature .",
    "this effect can be also seen  @xcite at higher sps energies .",
    "* the energy - dependence of @xmath7 seems to be non - monotonic , tab .",
    "[ tab:1 ] . at @xmath13gev",
    ", @xmath7 gets a value larger than unity , @xmath77 .",
    "these results is contract with that was predicted  @xcite that @xmath7 remains smaller than unity and increases to unity as energy increases .",
    "the problem of estimating @xmath7 at low energy is very obvious .",
    "fortunately , the present work is devoted to _  high hnergy  _ , analysis of the critical temperature , rhic top energies . *",
    "finally , we notice that the parameters at partially chemical equilibrium are accompanied by some modifications in the particle ratios , especially in @xmath78 .",
    "this might be originated in the advantages of taking into consideration the new parameter , @xmath7 , which apparently has a strong effect on the strange particles .      in framework of hrg ,",
    "the pion number density and other thermodynamic quantities at @xmath80 gev was conjectured to be constant  @xcite .",
    "thus , the change in the particle ratios @xmath79 and @xmath1 is characterized by the changed number density of @xmath45 and @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "starting with @xmath1 , the thermal number density of @xmath81 can be written as ( in boltzmann limit ) [ n ] n_= _ s^2 m_^2 k_2 ( ) , [ denphi ] where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are degeneracy and mass of @xmath81 meson , respectively . @xmath1",
    "ratio is not included in extracting the freeze - out parameters in both cases . from the above equation ,",
    "@xmath81 meson is sensitive to both temperature and @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath1 was used to check whether the strangeness suppression in pp interactions according to the canonical suppression or according to @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath81-meson is not canonically suppressed , because it carries zero strangeness quantum number ( strange and anti - strange quark ) .",
    "therefore , this ratio can be used to determine _ the degree of chemical non - equilibrium _ in high - energy collisions . in fig .",
    "[ fig : phipi ] , we confront the hrg calculations in fully and partially chemical equilibrium with the experimental data  @xcite of au - au collision at energies @xmath12 , @xmath58 and @xmath49 gev at centrality @xmath44 , @xmath84 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "although , this is apparently based on the observation that the hrg calculations at fully and partially chemical equilibrium are almost indistinguishable , the fitting with partially chemical equilibrium has a slightly ( or even no ) improvement in @xmath70 .",
    "furthermore , this fitting results in non - monotonic energy - dependence of @xmath7 as well as @xmath5 , fig .",
    "[ fig : tmub_comp ] .",
    "when @xmath81-meson is not depend on @xmath6 and one use the approximately constant temperature at energies @xmath85gev @xcite , a small variation in @xmath7 will be clear in experimental data . to guide the eyes , we draw two curves representing the hrg calculations at fixed @xmath86mev , as limiting temperature @xmath86mev estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite , assuming @xmath87 ( solid curve ) and @xmath88 ( dashed curve ) .",
    "the experimental data the @xmath1 seems to be approximately constant which lead that @xmath7 should be constant or vary very slowly .",
    "it is worthwhile to highlight here that the two curves almost equally agree with the experimental data .",
    "nevertheless , the curve at fully chemical equilibrium assures all physical aspects discussed in previous paragraphs .    in boltzmann limit , the number density of @xmath45 baryon can be determined as [ n ] n_= _ s^3tg _ m_^2 k_2(m_t ) ( ) , [ denomega ] where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are degeneracy and mass of @xmath45 baryon , respectively .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath79 ratio is very sensitive to @xmath7 as well as to the temperature .",
    "the temperature - dependence of this ratio was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . fig .",
    "[ fig : omegapi ] shows that the experimental ratios  @xcite compared to calculations from the hrg model at fully and partially chemical equilibrium . as done in fig .",
    "[ fig : phipi ] , two curves representing hrg calculations at fixed @xmath91mev @xcite and @xmath87 ( solid curve ) and @xmath88 ( dashed curve ) .",
    "the fit with at fully chemical equilibrium seems to indicate expandability of extra - parameters like @xmath0 .    here , the experimental data of @xmath79 seems to be constant .",
    "if one would assume that the temperature varies very slowly at relatively low chemical potential as predicted by lqcd  @xcite and hrg calculations  @xcite , one would be able to deduce from eq .",
    "( [ denomega ] ) that @xmath7 should remain fixed in this range of energy or allows it to vary but very slowly .",
    "more accurate measurements for @xmath79 and @xmath1 in relative high energy ( with the help of approximately constant temperature ) , can help to make a non - doubtful conclusion about the degree of chemical equilibrium at high energy .",
    "we have introduced a systematic analysis to perform an accurate discrimination of the quality of the fits with and without @xmath7 , using particle ratios instead of yields .",
    "several authors pointed out that this method introduces potentially severe biases in the parameters and the @xmath67 and in fact results in an inaccurate assessment of the fit quality @xcite thus , we want to present argumentation in favor of the implementation of particle ratios in order to deduce the freezeout parameters .    * in general",
    ", the particle - antiparticle ratios have low errorbars relative to all other particle ratios and of course yields .",
    "this is because the effect of rapidity cut will be cancelled out , the same as for flow .",
    "furthermore , the corrected baryon - antibaryon ratios are resonance independent . * form statistical point - of - view",
    ", the present analysis finds on two variables , @xmath25 and @xmath92 , by fixing @xmath93 different ratios .",
    "obviously , this would more accurate than finding three variables by fixing even @xmath94 particle ratios . * the previously mentioned extra variable , @xmath95 in mid - rapidity , which was needed to deal with the yields instead of the particle ratio seems no to have an exact definition .    beside these argumentations",
    ", we may also highlight that the ratios likely reduce the volume fluctuations , while the quantity @xmath95 surely come up with additional contribution to uncertainty . despite all these argumentations",
    ", we should not oversee any possible introduction of potential severe biases to the freezeout parameters and the @xmath67 .",
    "we have investigated the differences between hrg calculations for the chemical freeze - out parameters at fully and partially chemical equilibria . to this end ,",
    "the hrg results are compared with the particle ratios measured in central au - au collisions at a wide range of energies , as offered by the star bes - i .",
    "we conclude that the matter produced at these energies is likely in fully chemical equilibrium .",
    "this is also consistent with recent lattice qcd results . the possibility to improve the results by partially chemical equilibrium ( @xmath0 ) are very limited",
    ". actually , there is no strong justification for the time - consuming calculations for @xmath7 as an additional freeze - out parameter at least in the central collisions analysed in the present work .",
    "although , this is apparently based on the observation that the hrg calculations at fully and partially chemical equilibrium are almost indistinguishable in the figures , the fitting with partially chemical equilibrium have slightly ( or even no ) improvement in @xmath70 . furthermore , it leads to non - monotonic energy - dependence in @xmath7 and temperatures    a large variation in @xmath79 and @xmath1 would be seen in experimental data , if @xmath7 is allowed to vary with the energy , especially at approximately fixed temperature . as seen from figs .",
    "[ fig : omegapi ] and [ fig : phipi ] , when there is a slightly ( or even no ) improvement through the fitting according to the additional parameter @xmath7 , the fully chemical equilibrium becomes more acceptable .",
    "the results in the present work also consistent in general with with previous study in  @xcite at @xmath12 and @xmath48gev at most central au - au collision . in these studies",
    "the @xmath7 reached unity or very close to it at the central au - au collisions .",
    "accordingly , the outcome that the matter produced reaches full chemical equilibrium in central au - au at rhic energies is found .",
    "again , the evc account for the volume occupied by individual hadrons with radii @xmath33 for mesons and @xmath34 for baryons .",
    "the resulting freeze - out parameters @xmath5 , @xmath6 and even @xmath7 refer to irrelevance of evc , especially for single - core radii @xmath96fm .",

    "<S> we investigate the difference between hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) calculations for chemical freeze - out parameters at fully and partly chemical equilibria . to this end , </S>",
    "<S> the results are compared with the particle ratios measured in central au - au collisions at a wide range of nucleon - nucleon center - of - mass energies , as offered by the star experiment . </S>",
    "<S> we restrict the discussion to star , because of large statistics and overall homogeneity of star measurements ( one detector ) against previous experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the matter produced at these energies is likely in fully chemical equilibrium , which is consistent with recent lattice qcd results . </S>",
    "<S> the possible improvements by partial chemical equilibrium ( @xmath0 ) are very limited . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss these results with the ones deduced from @xmath1 and @xmath2 ratios . </S>",
    "<S> these hadron ratios are sensitive to the degree of chemical equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the conclusion that the matter produced reaches fully chemical equilibrium in central au - au at rhic energies is confirmed . </S>"
