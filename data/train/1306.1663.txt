    "the conventional superconducting ( sc ) phase is characterized by a spatially uniform sc order parameter as a reflection of the bose - einstein condensation . in several situations ,",
    "however , a sc ground state can have a spatial modulation in the sc order parameter even if quantized vortices are absent .",
    "such a modulated sc state is regarded as one of the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) states @xcite and is usually stabilized by a population imbalance of up - spin and down - spin electrons in the momentum space , i.e. , by a _ uniform _",
    "splitting between the two species of fermi surfaces provided by strong pauli paramagnetic pair - breaking .",
    "it is believed at present through extensive studies that the high field sc phase in the heavy fermion material cecoin@xmath1 is the above - mentioned fflo vortex state with a one - dimensional modulation parallel to the applied magnetic field @xcite .",
    "it has been clarified recently in different contexts that a similar but different type of spatially modulated sc state becomes possible in nodal @xmath0-wave superconductors if the quasiparticle dispersion @xmath2 includes an additional term linear in @xmath3 of the type @xmath4 where @xmath3 is the wavevector , @xmath5 is @xmath3-independent , and @xmath6 is an even function of @xmath3 .",
    "such contexts include ( 1 ) zero field cases in an external current @xcite , ( 2 ) thin films in zero field @xcite , and ( 3 ) rashba noncentrosymmetric superconductors in a magnetic field parallel to a gap node direction @xcite . the vector @xmath5 in eq.(1 )",
    "is proportional to the strength of the external current in the case ( 1 ) , the inverse of the film thickness in the case ( 2 ) , and the zeeman energy and the spin - orbit coupling in the case ( 3 ) . in all of these cases ,",
    "an interplay between the @xmath3-dependence in the last term of eq.(1 ) and the corresponding one of the sc gap function favors a spatial modulation parallel to a gap - node direction in the sc state .",
    "we note that it is a fflo - like state accompanied only by a pure _ phase _ modulation which may be realized in all the cases if the vortices are absent .    in the present work ,",
    "we focus on the above - mentioned case ( 2 ) , i.e. , a sc film sample with an anisotropic nodal pairing . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "a tendency of formation of the modulated sc state in a sc film with @xmath7-wave pairing has been pointed out in zero field case @xcite . there , a @xmath7-wave paired sc film sample is assumed to have a gap node parallel to the film plane and to be obtained by cutting the bulk sample along the plane formed by a nodal ( e.g. , ( @xmath8 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) ) and @xmath10 directions , and , in addition , the specular condition on the boundary surfaces is assumed . the main point in ref.@xcite",
    "is that a combination of this boundary condition and the @xmath0-wave pairing symmetry leads to a spatial modulation of the sc order parameter parallel to the film plane _ and _ a gap node direction .",
    "in contrast , if the boundary surface is not parallel to any gap node direction but is parallel to an anti - node ( e.g. , ( @xmath8,@xmath9,@xmath9 ) ) direction in the @xmath7-pairing case , no stable modulated sc state appears , and just the ordinary spatially uniform sc state is realized in zero field .",
    "then , it is natural to imagine whether this nontrivial mechanism leading to a modulated sc state is affected by applying a uniform magnetic field .",
    "since , at least , the zeeman effect on the conduction electrons breaks a spin - singlet pair , the modulated state in zero field would be suppressed with increasing field .",
    "however , it is unclear whether , by increasing the field , this state gives way to the normal state or other sc states .",
    "in fact , the _ conventional _ fflo state due to the momentum - independent population imbalance should be realized in high fields and at low temperatures .",
    "the resulting field - induced competition between the two different modulated states may lead to unusual field dependences of the phase diagram in intermediate fields .",
    "hereafter , we investigate possible field v.s .",
    "temperature phase diagrams of films of unconventional superconductors in a magnetic field parallel to the film plane by assuming that the material is close to the pauli limit so that the presence of vortices is negligible . even in film samples with thickness of several times of the zero temperature coherence length @xmath11",
    ", field - induced vortices might not be negligible in general .",
    "nevertheless , if the applied magnetic field , i.e. , the straight vortex axis , is parallel to the modulation direction of the phase - modulated state occurring even in zero field , the vortex lattice pattern in the plane perpendicular to the field is unaffected by this phase - modulation , implying that conclusions on the ( mean field ) transitions to the normal phase and to the modulated sc states obtained in the pauli limit , i.e. , without the orbital pair - breaking , are applicable to describing real superconductors with large paramagnetic pair - breaking effect .",
    "this argument is based on previous studies on the corresponding bulk system @xcite . of course",
    ", the spatially uniform sc phase appearing in our calculation in the pauli limit should correspond to an ordinary vortex lattice in a thin film , which consists of the vortices running straight along the field parallel to the film plane .",
    "geometry of the present system is illustrated in fig.1 .",
    "although our focus is primarily on the nodal @xmath0-wave superconductors , we also discuss a simpler nodal @xmath12-wave pairing case in order to clarify that one of origins of the present phase - modulated state in zero field is a gap node parallel to the film plane .",
    "it is found that , for a film thickness of several times of @xmath11 , applying a weak parallel magnetic field in the @xmath0-wave nodal sc case changes the modulated sc state in _ low _ fields to the normal state , while the uniform sc and the _ conventional _ fflo states survive in higher fields further .",
    "consequently , reentrant sc phases are expected to occur with increasing the field for a film thickness of several times of @xmath11 .",
    "it is pointed out that such a strange field dependence of the sc phases , in part , stems from the nonmonotonous thickness dependence of the sc transition temperature in zero field @xcite .     and the @xmath7-pairing in which the gap nodes are parallel to the film plane ( the @xmath7 symmetry in this setup is called hereafter as @xmath13 ) .",
    "the @xmath14-pairing case is also indicated here for comparison .",
    "the flat film surfaces are in @xmath10-@xmath15 plane . due to the specular boundary condition on the quasiparticles under the gap nodes parallel to the film plane ,",
    "the amplitude of the sc gap function @xmath16 is suppressed to zero on the sample surfaces .",
    "effects of a finite magnetic field applied in the gap - node direction within the 2d plane ( the @xmath15-direction ) will be considered in sec.iii . ]",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii , theoretical formulation",
    "is explained , and thickness v.s .",
    "temperature phase diagrams of a @xmath0-wave film taken at low enough fields are discussed together with a @xmath12-wave case in zero field in sec.iii . in sec.iv , field v.s .",
    "temperature phase diagrams in the @xmath0-wave case which are our main focus in the present work are discussed . in sec.v , the present work is summarized .",
    "in the present work , the boundary condition for the sc order parameter @xmath17 on the film surface plays an important role in obtaining a spatial modulation of the sc order parameter . to explain how the boundary condition results in a modulated sc phase , let us start from describing the quasiclassical approach used in the present work .",
    "since we study not only the spin - singlet @xmath0-wave pairing in magnetic fields but also a @xmath12-wave pairing case in zero field , eilenberger equations for the quasiclassical green s functions @xcite represented in the nambu space will be considered .",
    "following ref.@xcite , they are expressed by @xmath18 + i { \\bf v}_{\\rm f}\\cdot\\nabla { \\hat g}=0,\\ ] ] where the bracket denotes the commutator , @xmath19 is a fermion matsubara frequency , and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 ) are the particle - hole pauli matrices .",
    "we largely follow ref.@xcite regarding the notation of the gap function and the green s functions @xmath24 satisfying @xmath25 .",
    "they will be parameterized in the form    @xmath26    the matrix @xmath27 expresses the zeeman energy term . in the parallel field configuration ( @xmath28 ) of our interest in the following sections , @xmath27 is diagonal , and its element gives the zeeman energy @xmath29 in the nambu space .",
    "further , @xmath30 is the center - of - mass coordinate of a cooper pair . as mentioned in sec.i @xcite , the orbital pair - breaking effect inducing the vortices",
    "can be safely neglected in the present geometry ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "thus , the strength of the magnetic field can be identified hereafter with the dimensionless zeeman energy @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the euler constant .",
    "the numerical factor @xmath33 in the above expression results from the conventional definition of the maki parameter @xmath34 for the @xmath35-wave bulk superconductor @xcite .",
    "as is well known , minimization of the free energy with respect to the gap function @xmath17 results in the so - called gap equation , which , in the spin - singlet - pairing case , connects @xmath36 with the scalar anomalous green s functions @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the manner @xmath39 here , @xmath40 is the sc transition temperature in zero field , and @xmath41 is the angle average over the fermi surface .",
    "further , @xmath42 denotes the normalized pairing function satisfying @xmath43 .",
    "it appears through the factorization @xmath44 and , in the case with gap nodes parallel to the @xmath45-direction , is proportional to @xmath46 .",
    "the system geometry is reflected in the boundary condition on @xmath47 on the outer surface . as in ref.@xcite , the specular condition on a flat boundary surface in @xmath10-@xmath15 plane will be used by assuming a surface roughness to be negligible ( see the geometry in fig.1 ) .",
    "then , we have @xmath48 _ on the surface _ , where @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is the unit vector normal to the surface , which is in the @xmath51-direction in fig.1 .",
    "it means that , if @xmath52 the sc order parameter @xmath53 and @xmath54 vanish on the surface . among pairing states satisfying eq.([bc ] ) , we will focus below on the following ones @xmath55 both of which , in @xmath15-@xmath51 plane , have a gap node in the parallel direction to the boundary surface .",
    "the former case corresponds to a film sample prepared by cutting a @xmath7-paired superconductor along , for instance , the ( @xmath8,@xmath8,@xmath9 ) direction .",
    "hereafter , this situation with the @xmath7-pairing symmetry will be called as @xmath13-pairing case .",
    "in addition , as a typical @xmath56-dependence of @xmath53 vanishing on @xmath57 ( see fig.1 ) , we choose the form @xmath58 for simplicity , the cylindrical fermi surface with the symmetry axis parallel to @xmath59 will be used throughout this paper .",
    "as will be stressed in sec.iii , a continuous normal to superconducting ( sc ) transition point can be found directly from the o(@xmath60 ) term of the free energy , or equivalently , from eq.([gap ] ) linearized with respect to @xmath17 . to obtain a transition occurring deep in the sc phase such as an onset of a fflo modulation , the following quasiclassical representation @xcite of the sc contribution @xmath61 to the luttinger - ward free energy functional @xmath62 is more useful rather than the gap equation ( [ gap ] ) , where @xmath63 is the density of states ( per spin ) at the fermi level in the normal state , and the auxiliary green s function @xmath64 is the solution of the eilenberger equation with @xmath36 replaced by @xmath65 .",

    "in this section , we will discuss the zero field case . by comparing thickness - temperature phase diagrams for the spin - triplet @xmath14-pairing and the spin - singlet @xmath13-pairing @xcite cases to each other ,",
    "we stress that the presence of a gap node parallel to the film plane induces the phase - modulated state at lower temperatures and that a strange thickness dependence of the sc transition temperature is commonly seen in those sc films .    to discuss the character of the normal to sc phase transition in the mean field ( mf ) approximation which is signaled by vanishing of the sc energy gap , the form of the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) free energy which can be obtained from the gap equation ( [ gap ] ) will be explained . by introducing the fourier - transformation @xmath69 to incorporate possibilities of a spatially varying mean field solution of @xmath70 , the quadratic ( o(@xmath60)- ) term of the gl free energy",

    "by first assuming the transition to be continuous , let us consider the situation under which the coefficient of @xmath75 in eq.([gl2 ] ) vanishes . in the cases of our interest , @xmath76 ,",
    "i.e. , when we have gap nodes in the @xmath45-direction , the sign factor @xmath77 in eq.([gl2 ] ) may contribute to the negative sign for a broad range of the @xmath78-value .",
    "then , inevitably , a state with a finite @xmath68 , i.e. , a state with a modulation parallel to a gap node is favored in order for @xmath79 to be also accompanied by the negative sign so that the negative sign of the coefficient of the @xmath75 term , i.e. , the sc ordering , may become possible .",
    "like the mechanism leading to the conventional fflo state induced by the zeeman field , the dimensionless film thickness normalized by the zero temperature coherence length @xmath80 , i.e. , @xmath81 plays the roles of the zeeman energy in the familiar field - induced fflo case in the present case .",

    "the resulting stability region of a modulated ff sc state has been determined by use of eq.([free energy ] ) .",
    "we note that , as pointed out in ref.@xcite , the present phase - modulated ff state is always more stable than the lo state .",

    "in fact , although a nonmonotonic behavior of the second order transition curve @xmath84 is present even in the @xmath13-pairing case ( see fig.4 ( b ) ) , it is less remarkable compared with that in the @xmath14-pairing case ( fig.3 ) .",
    "nevertheless , as the inset of fig.4 ( a ) shows , this low temperature behavior of the @xmath84 curve is robust against a weak magnetic field . in sec.iii",
    ", it will be shown that this nearly flat but nonmonotonic feature close to @xmath103 of @xmath84-curve results in a reentry of the ff and normal phases in films with thickness of about @xmath105 .",
    "in contrast , in sufficiently thick films with large @xmath0 , the ff phase is destabilized by such a weak magnetic field ( see the inset of fig.4 ) .    for comparison",
    ", we will comment on the @xmath7-pairing case in which an anti - nodal direction is parallel to the film plane . in this case",
    ", the boundary condition ( [ bc ] ) is not satisfied , and the uniform superconductivity rather than the ff state is always favored .",
    "thus , within the approximation used here , disappearance of superconductivity due to the size effect does not occur in this case .",
    "next , let us examine how the phase diagram of the @xmath13-pairing case is changed by applying a uniform magnetic field . for this purpose , the orbital pair - breaking effect of the magnetic field will be neglected .",
    "this assumption is reasonable for describing thin films with thickness of several times of @xmath11 .",
    "further , as argued in sec.i , it is at least qualitatively valid even with vortices as far as @xmath106 @xcite",
    ". then , a nonvanishing magnetic field appears only through the zeeman energy @xmath29 , and its effect can be incorporated simply by replacing @xmath77 with @xmath107 in eq.([gl2 ] ) ( see @xcite and appendix for details ) .",
    "then , the two cosine - factors compete in their signs in the @xmath78-integral in eq.([gl2 ] ) .",
    "physically , this implies that the applied magnetic field frustrates and thus , weakens the size effect enhanced by the gap nodes . since",
    ", on the other hand , superconductivity in the present systems is suppressed with decreasing the film thickness , the applied magnetic field competing with the size effect may enhance superconductivity .",
    "below , it will be explained that , in thin sc films with gap nodes parallel to the film plane and with thickness of the order of several times of @xmath11 , rich behaviors reflecting the competition between the magnetic field and the gap node - induced size effect can occur in the field v.s .",

    "thickness dependence of the @xmath109 v.s .",
    "@xmath108 phase diagrams we have obtained is presented in fig.5 .",
    "although the obtained transition curves in the figures have been determined from the quasi - classical formulation in sec.ii with eq.([free energy ] ) , all the sc transitions appearing in the present phase diagram can be alternatively obtained from the gl free energy shown in appendix because they are of second order in character .",
    "as seen in fig.3 of ref.@xcite ( see also fig.4 in the present work ) , as far as the same boundary condition is used , the ff phase of sc films with a gap node parallel to the film plane under zero field inevitably appears even in sufficiently thick films with @xmath110 at low enough temperatures @xcite .",
    "reflecting this fact , fig.5(a ) includes this ff phase at low enough temperatures if the applied field is sufficiently low . with decreasing the film thickness , however , the temperature regions of the uniform and lo sc phases are narrower , while the ff phase grows and begins to occupy a broader field and temperature region ( see fig.5(b ) ) . in particular , it is notable in fig.5(b ) that , as the ff phase grows , the field - induced lo phase shrinks and , together with the normal to sc transition curve , is pushed up to higher fields .",
    "this competition between these two modulated sc phases seems to result in extension of the intermediate _ spatially - uniform _ sc phase .",
    "for instance , the point ( @xmath111 , @xmath112 ) in fig.5(b ) is included in the uniform sc phase , although the same point in fig.5(a ) is in the normal phase , suggestive of an _ extension _ of the uniform sc phase in thinner films .",
    "more interestingly , for further thinner films with the thickness @xmath113 , the normal phase begins to intervene between the ff and the uniform sc phases at low temperatures to push the ff phase down to lower fields with decreasing the thickness ( see fig.5(c ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "it is a remarkable feature that the normal phase begins to enter along the boundary between the ff and uniform phases with decreasing the film thickness so that the uniform sc phase at _ higher _ fields can remain stable against the normal state ( see fig.5(e ) and ( f ) ) .",
    "the above - mentioned _ competition _ between the size effect and the finite magnetic field and the resulting reentrant survival of the _ spatially - uniform _ sc phase are nontrivial and main results in the present work .",
    "as already mentioned , all the transitions appearing in these phase diagrams are of second order . in fig.6 ,",
    "field dependences of the amplitude of the sc order parameter @xmath17 and the fflo order parameter @xmath68 taken on the dotted vertical lines in fig.5(d ) and ( e ) are shown .",
    "for instance , in fig.6 ( a ) , the linear vanishing of @xmath60 at three @xmath109-values and that of @xmath89 in the vicinity of @xmath114 imply the second order character of these transitions .",
    "the @xmath89 curve has its physical meaning when @xmath16 is nonvanishing .",
    "for this reason , @xmath68 data are not shown in fig.6 in the field regions of the normal state .",
    "( solid curves ) and @xmath89 ( dashed ones ) taken on the dotted vertical lines in figs.5 ( d ) and ( e ) are presented in the figures ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "the linear vanishings of @xmath60 and of @xmath89 under a finite @xmath16-value ensure that these transitions are of second order in character . ]    in contrast to the @xmath13-pairing case , the ff phase does not occur if the film plane is parallel to an anti - nodal direction of the @xmath7-pairing function .",
    "then , the resulting field v.s .",
    "temperature sc phase diagram consists only of the uniform and lo sc phases with no reentry of a low field normal phase .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the phase structure of a sc film with an unconventional nodal pairing and , in particular , have focused on its change due to an applied magnetic field parallel to the film plane .",
    "it has been found that , when the pairing state has a gap node parallel to the film plane , and consequently , the sc energy gap or the sc order parameter is deformed along the film s surface normal , a kind of fulde - ferrell ( ff ) sc phase with a spatial modulation parallel to the film plane of the _ phase _ of the sc order parameter is inevitably induced upon cooling in zero field . when a magnetic field parallel to the gap - node direction is applied , and the system is close to the pauli limit , this unconventional ff state and the conventional larkin - ovchinnikov ( lo ) state in high fields coexist in the same field v.s .",

    ", vortices can be neglected in discussing thermodynamics and the static phase diagram of superconductors close to the pauli limit . since , as seen in fig.5 , the main point in the present work is the reentry of the normal phase in _ lower _ fields in thinner films , inclusion of the field - induced vortices in the present theory is expected not to lead to essential changes of our main results .",
    "an intriguing point is an apparent competition between the fulde - ferrell ( ff ) state in lower fields and the conventional larkin - ovchinnikov ( lo ) state at the high field end of the sc phase .",
    "in fact , the ff phase arises from the anisotropic response to an external field in the momentum space ( see eq.([rashba ] ) ) and thus , is incompatible with the lo state to be realized even in the isotropic system .",
    "therefore , it may be expected that the field - induced reentry of the uniform sc phase will also occur in other systems with a zero field fflo phase , e.g. , a case with a fflo state induced by a multi - band effect or with a fflo state induced by an electric current @xcite .",
