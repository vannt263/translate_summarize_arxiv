    "the known universe is much larger now than in archimedes time and `` the grains of sand '' much finer .",

    "sorkin s proposal : _ in 1990 , sorkin proposed using the causet approach to quantum gravity that the smallness of @xmath13 could be understood as a quantum fluctuation .",
    "sorkin s causet approach to quantum gravity replaces spacetime by a discrete structure , a collection of points carrying causal relations .",
    "the number @xmath8 of points is the four volume @xmath18 of spacetime ( more precisely the four volume of the causal past of a cosmic observer in planck units ) .",

    "these @xmath24 fluctuations are the mechanism for a small and nonzero cosmological constant . based on this argument from quantum gravity , sorkin predicts@xcite the following order of magnitude for the fluctuations in @xmath13 : @xmath25 this gives a logical basis for relating @xmath11 with the archimedes number @xmath8 in accordance with dirac s large number hypothesis .",

    "other researchers@xcite have also followed on sorkin s idea with slight variations .",
    "_ analogy : _ in @xcite we developed an analogy between the universe and a fluid membrane .",

    "the quantum fluctuations of spacetime map to the thermal fluctuations of a membrane .",
    "the breakdown of the smooth geometric picture at the molecular scale @xmath26 corresponds to the planck scale discreteness of spacetime expected from quantum gravity .",

    "it is worth emphasizing that the analogy is of a formal and mathematical nature ( rather than a physical one ) . as a result",
    "we have mappings between physically disparate elements .",
    "for example the analogue of the cosmological constant of the universe is the surface tension of a membrane .",
    "the _ statics _ of membranes is mapped to the _ dynamics _ of spacetime .",
    "what is striking about our analogy is that it maps the exotic and ill understood physics of quantum gravity into relatively well understood physics , which is testable by laboratory and numerical experiments .    to illustrate the analogy ,",
    "we show how renormalisation effects generate a surface tension which is of order @xmath39 . here",
    "@xmath35 is the temperature and @xmath26 a molecular length scale , which is around nanometres .",
    "we will sometimes use `` natural units '' and set @xmath35 and @xmath26 to unity . as an instructive example , we start with a microscopic energy in which the surface tension is set to zero _ by hand_. consider such a membrane whose equilibrium configuration is a plane rectangle with sides @xmath40 and area @xmath41 .",
    "due to thermal fluctuations , the membrane will vibrate about its equilibrium configuration . assuming small vibrations",
    ", we can model them as harmonic oscillators and expect by equipartition that the expectation value of energy @xmath42 in each mode is @xmath35 . performing a sum over modes to evaluate the contribution from all the modes we find a divergent answer which has to be regulated by the molecular scale cutoff .",
    "@xmath43 where @xmath44 is a wave vector and @xmath45 is the cutoff set by the molecular scale .",
    "performing the @xmath46 integral we find that this contributes a term @xmath47 to the energy , giving rise to a surface tension @xmath48 of order 1 in dimensionless units .",
    "even if one assumes that the microscopic energy has zero surface tension , such a term is generated by `` radiative corrections '' in a manner analogous to the generation of vacuum energy from the casimir effect .",
    "so we would expect that most membranes have a value of order @xmath49 for the surface tension .",
    "this expectation is borne out for most interfaces .",
    "however , there is a notable exception -fluid membranes- which we now turn to .    _",
    "fluid membranes : _ fluid membranes@xcite are composed of amphiphilic molecules , which consist of hydrophilic ( water loving ) polar head groups and hydrophobic ( water hating ) hydrocarbon tails . common examples of amphiphilic molecules are soaps and detergents , phospholipids , cholesterol and glycolipids .",
    "if one adds amphiphiles to water , they cluster together to hide their tails and so form supramolecular structures like micelles , vesicles and symmetric bilayers .",
    "bilayers of phospholipids are studied by physicists as simple models for the biological cell membrane .",
    "these bilayers are sometimes called fluid membranes as the amphiphilic molecules flow freely on the two dimensional surface of the membrane .",

    "fluid membranes are an exception in having vanishing surface tension .",
    "a tensionless fluid membrane solves part a ) of the analogue cosmological constant problem .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the fluid membrane also solves part b ) by virtue of its small surface tension fluctuations .",
    "this is a direct analog of sorkin s suggestion @xcite that there are small fluctuations in the cosmological constant due to spacetime discreteness on quantum gravity scales within the causet framework@xcite .    _",
    "the analogue cosmological constant problem : _ from fairly simple theory @xcite one can understand the tensionless state of fluid membranes .",
    "as one increases the areal density of molecules in the fluid membrane , the area per molecule @xmath52 decreases . there is a limit to this packing density however , and at a critical value of @xmath53 , there is a minimum in the free energy per molecule @xmath54 . a fluid membrane which can adjust its areal density does so to attain this critical value of @xmath52 and is said to be saturated .",

    "@xcite for some references ) .",
    "it has long been realised that fluid membranes can exist in a tensionless state .",
    "the effects of the vanishing surface tension can be seen in the variety of shapes assumed by red blood cells , which is well explained theoretically on the basis of a vanishing surface tension . the flickering of red blood cells due to thermal fluctuations has also been noted . however , quantitative experiments do not usually yield a value for this small tension but only place upper bounds . for instance ,",
    "kwok and evans@xcite probe the surface tension of a fluid membrane using pipette aspiration techniques .",
    "the upper bound they give is three orders of magnitude smaller than dimensionally expected @xmath65 .",
    "the fluctuating surface tension of part b ) was first predicted in @xcite and an experiment was proposed to measure it .",

    "one of the rings is attached to a piezoelectric translation stage which can be moved in nanometer steps .",
    "the other ring is attached to a micron sized bead which is confined in an optical trap . fixing the separation @xmath67 by using a feedback loop , one can measure the force @xmath68 on the bead .",
    "this force @xmath68 is related to the surface tension by @xmath69 .",
    "we expect to see fluctuations@xcite in the surface tension due to finiteness of @xmath60 over and above any instrumental noise which may be present .",
    "such an experiment can be viewed as an analog quantum gravity experiment probing a small nonzero fluctuating cosmological constant .",
    "there are practical , though not insurmountable , difficulties of working with real laboratory fluid membranes which are small enough to show an appreciable fluctuation .",
    "in contrast , a computer simulation is cleaner and the relevant tunable parameters are more in control .",
    "this motivated us to use a computer simulation or a `` numerical experiment '' to test our theoretical predictions .",
    "in molecular dynamics simulations ( mds ) @xcite one integrates the microscopic equations ( newton s equations ) that govern the motion of each atom .",
    "such simulations are computationally expensive and therefore not very efficient when one has to study the behaviour of a system containing a large number of particles for a long time . a more efficient scheme called dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd ) has been developed@xcite , which groups atoms into beads and uses a coarse grained description .",
    "the beads interact by conservative forces as well as dissipative and random forces . these last two are chosen , consistent with the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , to ensure that the system equilibriates to a boltzmann distribution .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that dpd is orders of magnitude more efficient than mds and gives the same results .",
    "the increased efficiency of dpd permits us to study the surface tension fluctuations of fluid membranes for a range of membrane sizes .",

    "the equilibrium position of our membrane is a flat surface in the @xmath73 plane with an area determined by the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "however , due to thermal fluctuations the membrane explores curved configurations , leading to area as well as surface tension fluctuations . while the fluctuation effects seen and their @xmath60 dependence is to be expected , they have not so far been experimentally studied .",
    "neither has their theoretical significance for quantum gravity been appreciated .",
    "this is what we turn to next .",
    "sorkin s suggestion of a fluctuating @xmath13 neatly solves the brobdingnag problem of explaining a small but non zero cosmological constant : @xmath13 is as small as it can be , given the uncertainties inherent in quantum gravity . as a bonus",
    ", it also automatically solves the `` coincidence problem '' .",
    "the measured value for @xmath13 today is comparable to @xmath118 , the matter density in the universe . according to the standard picture of a cosmological @xmath119 , @xmath13 must have been subdominant in the past and is only _ now _ starting to dominate the dynamics of the universe .",
    "but `` why _ now _ ? '' , a puzzle known as the coincidence problem .",
    "it appears to be a coincidence that we live in the epoch where @xmath13 and @xmath118 are of comparable magnitude . in sorkin s",
    "proposal , there is nothing special about our present epoch .",
    "@xmath120 at all epochs , in four spacetime dimensions .",
    "this conclusion of an `` everpresent @xmath13 '' is unaffected by extra dimensions @xcite provided only that these are not _ large _ extra dimensions , much bigger than the planck scale .",
    "sorkin s argument implies that the order of magnitude of the fluctuations in @xmath13 was larger in the past than it is today .",
    "a common reaction from astronomers is that such a theory can be observationally ruled out .",
    "this reaction is usually based on the standard notion of cosmological _ constant _ which is not a fluctuating quantity .",
    "if indeed , sorkin s idea can be disproved observationally , it would be wonderful , for then , we would have a real confrontation between theory and experiment in quantum gravity .",
    "the logic behind sorkin s suggestion is simple enough to be convincing .",
    "if a simple chain of logic leads to a conflict with observation ( remember olber s paradox ) there is much to be learned since one of the links in the chain must give .",
    "however , the idea of a fluctuating cosmological constant is still in its infancy and needs development and precision to make further testable predictions .",
    "a number of points remain unclear : what does one mean by a fluctuating cosmological constant ?",
    "is it a fixed fluctuation for the whole universe ? does @xmath13 depend on cosmic epoch ? or cosmic location ?",
    "does this not conflict with einstein s equations which imply a constant @xmath13 via the bianchi identity ?",
    "what is the role of einstein s equations ?",
    "how general is sorkin s idea ?",
    "is it inherently tied to the causet approach to quantum gravity , or do other approaches also predict a fluctuating @xmath13 ?",
    "let us now learn from the soft matter analogy and address these questions .",
    "the first lesson we learn concerns our attitude towards spacetime , gravity and the cosmological constant .",
    "the orthodox view of spacetime is that of a smooth manifold . this is a picture that works well over a range of scales .",
    "gravity is normally viewed by relativists as a fundamental theory of _ pure _ geometry , and if a cosmological constant is present , @xmath13 is viewed as a fixed number whose numerical value is to be determined from experiment . however , borrowing a leaf from condensed matter physics , we see that the geometric description of a membrane as a smooth surface embedded in space is only an emergent picture valid at long ( say micron ) length scales . at a molecular scale ( nanoscale )",
    "a membrane is roughened @xcite by relative displacements and protrusions of individual molecules jostling for space .",
    "the surface tension emerges at low energies as a `` chemical potential '' describing the energy cost of creating a unit area of membrane . like any chemical potential ,",
    "the surface tension can fluctuate for finite systems as we have seen it does . in gravity",
    ", we should by analogy , view gr as an emergent effective description valid at long length scales",
    ". there may be a true microscopic theory ( similar to the molecular description of membranes ) underlying gr , but we do not know what it is and are not here attempting to guess what it is .",
    "whatever the microscopic description is ( string theory , loop quantum gravity , causets , non - commutative geometry or any other candidate ) , we restrict ourselves to long wavelength phenomena and try to find low energy imprints of planck scale effects , just as brownian motion was manifested at micron scales . in this spirit",
    "the cosmological constant should be viewed as a `` chemical potential '' for the creation of spacetime .",
    "it is the action cost for creating a unit four volume of spacetime , just as the surface tension is the energy cost for creating a unit area of membrane . like any chemical potential ,",
    "the cosmological constant too is subject to fluctuations .    what does one mean by a fluctuating cosmological constant ? from the membrane analogy , we know that for a flat membrane in its equilibrium configuration , the surface tension is a constant .",
    "this follows from the condition for mechanical equilibrium @xmath121 however this equation only holds in the thermally averaged sense . as we saw earlier",
    ", a finite lipid membrane has fluctuations about its equilibrium configuration .",
    "we would thus expect that the surface tension has local fluctuations which depend on position and have vanishing mean : @xmath122 we would similarly expect in the cosmological context that @xmath13 has spacetime dependent fluctuations .",
    "@xmath123 we see already from sorkin s argument ( since it can be applied at any epoch ) that the fluctuating @xmath13 is not a fixed constant for the whole universe : it does depend on cosmic time . however",
    ", then it would be natural to permit it to have spatial fluctuations as well as temporal ones .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath13 fluctuations do depend on cosmic epoch and location .    _",
    "einstein s equations : _",
    "einstein s equations imply via the bianchi identity that @xmath13 must be a constant .",
    "yet we have seen that @xmath13 has local fluctuations .",
    "how does one reconcile the two ?",
    "the membrane analogy suggests an answer .",
    "the condition for mechanical equilibrium ( [ equilibrium ] ) is only true on thermal averaging .",
    "it is not true as an operator equation .",
    "similarly , in cosmology , we are considering quantum fluctuations about a classical solution ( the homogeneous , isotropic robertson - walker metric ) .",
    "quantum fluctuations do not obey the classical einstein equations .",
    "we would still expect einstein s equations to hold in some average @xmath124 sense , but there is no reason to expect then to hold as operator equations .",
    "similarly the conservation of matter implied by einstein s equations classically , @xmath125 only holds on an average and not as an operator identity .",
    "it follows that a fluctuating @xmath13 does not have to be a constant in space and time as naively implied by einstein s equations .",
    "sorkin s proposal for a fluctuating @xmath13 was made within the context of causal sets and unimodular gravity .",
    "how essential are these inputs ?",
    "let us consider them in turn .",
    "+ _ causal sets _ in causal set theory , spacetime is approximated by a _ sprinkling _ of discrete points which are poisson distributed as a result of local lorentz invariance .",
    "the @xmath126 fluctuations have their origin in the poisson fluctuations of @xmath60 .",
    "a poisson distribution has the property that its variance @xmath127is equal to its mean @xmath128 for all @xmath60 .",
    "note however , that the lipid membrane system has a distribution of lipids which is certainly not poisson .",
    "there is repulsion between the molecules and their positions are anticorrelated",
    ". however , the system still shows @xmath126 fluctuations to a good approximation .",
    "the @xmath126 fluctuations seen in the bilayer are a result of the central limit theorem and the law of large numbers : for large enough @xmath60 , any distribution tends to a gaussian distribution whose width increases as @xmath126 .",
    "it appears then that poisson distribution is not essential for @xmath129 fluctuations , if @xmath60 is large enough . in the cosmological context , @xmath8 is comfortably large and we can safely suppose that there will be @xmath24 fluctuations of the cosmological constant .",
    "it appears then that the essential ingredient of sorkin s argument is _ discreteness _ of spacetime , rather than any other aspect of causet theory ( like local lorentz invariance ) .",
    "_ unimodular gravity : _ what is the role played by unimodular gravity ? to understand this",
    "we go back to the membrane system .",
    "the surface tension is a thermodynamic potential conjugate to the area of the membrane just as pressure is conjugate to volume .",
    "let us define the gibbs ensemble partition function @xmath130 @xmath131 in which the surface tension is regarded as the control parameter and the area fluctuates .",
    "it is also possible to define the `` helmholtz '' ensemble partition function @xmath132 which describes a system in which the area is held constant and the surface tension fluctuates .",
    "the helmholtz partition function relates to the gibbs partition function by a laplace transform : @xmath133 for systems at the thermodynamic limit the fluctuations are negligible and the two ensembles are equivalent , but for the finite size systems that we are interested in , there are differences@xcite .",
    "which ensemble is appropriate depends on the experimental conditions .",
    "if the control parameter is the surface tension then the gibbs ensemble should be used .",
    "one can also envisage more general ensembles in which neither the area nor the surface tension is held constant and both fluctuate .",
    "the fluctuations are related by something like an `` uncertainty '' relation @xmath134 .",
    "indeed this is the situation in the simulations we described in the last section .",
    "all we are holding constant in the simulation is the cyclic boundary conditions on the molecules .",
    "the area of the membrane _ and _ the surface tension show fluctuations of order @xmath126 and @xmath110 respectively in accord with the `` uncertainty '' relation .",
    "using the analogy above we can transcribe the description of a fluid membrane to the gravity context .",
    "we can write analogue `` partition functions '' .",
    "in both cases ( membranes as well as gravity ) we are assuming that the microscopic physics provides an ultraviolet cutoff so that the sums in ( [ gibbs],[helm],[gibbsgrav],[helmgrav ] ) are convergent .",
    "the `` gibbs partition function '' , which we write formally as @xmath135:=\\sum_{\\cal h } \\exp{i(\\lambda * { \\cal v}+i_2 ) } \\label{gibbsgrav}\\ ] ] can be viewed as simply one statistical ensemble in which @xmath13 is held fixed and its conjugate variable @xmath18 fluctuates .",
    "one could equally well consider the conjugate helmholtz ensemble @xmath136:=\\sum_{\\cal h } \\exp{(i i_2 ) } \\delta({\\cal v}({\\cal   h})-{\\cal v } ) \\label{helmgrav}\\ ] ] @xmath137 here is the einstein - hilbert action ( table 1 ) .",
    "if one takes the classical limit and evaluates this path integral by stationary phase one ends up with a theory in which the variations of the metric in the einstein - hilbert action are subject to the constraint that the four volume is unchanged .",
    "this theory is equivalent to unimodular gravity ! thus unimodular gravity @xcite should not be viewed as an exotic theory , but a close cousin of einstein s general relativity belonging to a different statistical ensemble and related to it by a legendre transform .",
    "classically the two theories are equivalent .",
    "in fact one can conceive of more general ensembles where _ both _ @xmath13 and @xmath138 are allowed to fluctuate .",
    "this is no different from having states in quantum mechanics which are neither position nor momentum eigenstates .",
    "there are fluctuations in both quantities and these fluctuations satisfy the uncertainty principle .",
    "it would then seem that the two essential components to sorkin s idea of a fluctuating cosmological constant are graininess of spacetime and a possibility of fluctuations in @xmath13 .",
    "the first ingredient is present in most approaches to quantum gravity .",
    "the second ingredient is easily incorporated by considering a conjugate ensemble .",
    "we conclude then that the idea of a fluctuating cosmological constant is not closely tied up with causets and unimodular gravity , but is more general .",
    "this conclusion is disappointing for causets , because the cosmological constant then does not favour causets over competing theories of quantum gravity . on the other hand ,",
    "the conclusion is a generic prediction of quantum gravity models and so sorkin s idea gives us a natural resolution of the cosmological constant problem from quantum gravity .",
    "as we remarked earlier , the analogy between the universe and fluid membranes is a mathematical one and maps physically disparate elements into each other .",
    "this sometimes has unexpected benefits .",
    "the cosmological constant problem is widely regarded as a difficult one .",
    "however , it appears that the analogue problem is almost trivially solved .",
    "free standing fluid membranes have a vanishing surface tension ( part a ) and have small surface tension fluctuations ( part b ) .",
    "while the vanishing surface tension of fluid membranes is regarded as commonplace in the soft matter community , its analogue in cosmology is far from trivial .",
    "it is worth spending a few words on why freestanding fluid membranes have vanishing surface tension .",
    "the hydrophobic interactions which govern the behaviour of lipid membranes are of high energy ( @xmath139 ) .",
    "such strong interactions give rise to strong forces that regroup particles ( in the form of a bilayer ) so that these strong forces are no longer effective .",
    "all we see at low energies is the residual effects that remain after these strong forces cancel out .",
    "these residual effects are a consequence of imperfect cancellations between the strong forces",
    ". similar physics happens in other systems .",
    "strong electromagnetic forces between protons and electrons are screened out when they form atoms and then interact by weak van der waal forces .",
    "this idea was expressed early and very well by newton ( opticks ) : `` now the smallest particles of matter may cohere by the strongest attractions , and compose bigger particles of weaker virtue ; and many of these may cohere and compose bigger particles whose virtue is still weaker , and so on for divers successions , until the progression end in the biggest particles on which the operations in chymistry , and the colours of natural bodies depend , and which by cohering compose bodies of a sensible magnitude . ''",
    "replacing the archaic `` virtue '' by its modern equivalents `` charge '' or `` coupling constants '' we see that newton has in mind `` emergent behaviour '' . the idea that physics depends on scale is a prevalent one in condensed matter physics and formalised in the renormalisation group .",
    "our attitude of viewing the supposedly fundamental theory of general relativity as an emergent description valid at low energies is borrowed from condensed matter physics and is fairly widespread today @xcite . in landau theory ,",
    "one expands the free energy in powers of decreasing length dimension and discards higher order terms .",
    "landau theory is essentially a low energy theory and has the advantage that we do not need to know the microscopic basis for the theory .",
    "the low energy description depends only on general symmetry properties and not on details of the microscopic theory .",
    "our ignorance of microscopics is absorbed into a set of phenomenological constants .",
    "for instance altering the values of @xmath86 which describe the forces between atoms will not change the @xmath60 dependence of @xmath64 , but could affect the value of @xmath49 .",
    "for quantum gravity , the microscopic theory is presently a matter of speculation and therefore it is of advantage not to have to commit ourselves to any particular model .",
    "doing effective field theory with gravitation is no harder than doing continuum elasticity , even though matter is fundamentally atomistic .",
    "our ignorance of fundamental physics can be lumped into a few `` elastic constants '' of which the cosmological constant is one .",
    "we must distinguish here between _",
    "generic _ predictions which do not depend on the microscopic theory and _ specific _ predictions which do .",
    "both have their value : generic predictions give us general quantum gravity insights into cosmology but do not discriminate between different microscopic theories , while specific predictions can hopefully be used to rule out some theories and favour others .",
    "for instance , we have seen that the @xmath12 dependence of the @xmath13 fluctuations is generic .",
    "but the coefficient which is of order unity may depend on the specific microscopic theory .",
    "* 2l & * universe * + dimension two & dimension four + euclidean geometries & lorentzian geometries + positive @xmath36 minimises area & positive @xmath140 causes accelerated expansion + no causal structure & causal structure + boundary value problem & initial value problem + ambient space and extrinsic geometry & purely intrinsic geometry + exponentially damped sum over configurations & oscillatory phase sum over histories + non - poissonian distribution of molecules&poissonian distribution of causet elements +    obvious differences are those of dimension ( four versus two ) and signature ( lorentzian versus euclidean ) . as a result of these differences , a positive @xmath13 tends to accelerate the expansion of the universe , whereas a positive @xmath36 tends to contract a membrane !",
    "the action of spacetime depends on purely intrinsic geometry , while the membrane energy depends on both intrinsic and extrinsic geometry .",
    "there is no analogue in membranes of the causal structure of spacetime which was a prime motivating force in sorkin s approach .",
    "the membrane problem is euclidean and best formulated as a boundary value problem , while in gr because of the lorentzian signature , an initial value problem is more natural . despite these differences ,",
    "the fluctuations expected in sorkin s approach appear in membranes and lead us to believe that sorkin s idea is truly more general than its original context . with all its limitations ,",
    "the analogy is a useful one and suggests future work in several directions .",
    "sorkin s idea of a fluctuating lambda is still incompletely explored .",
    "we feel it is a compelling idea which should be pursued to its logical conclusion and confronted with observational evidence .",
    "barrow @xcite has argued that observational cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) evidence rules out the idea of `` everpresent @xmath13 '' in the form it was developed by ahmed et al @xcite .",
    "but this avatar of sorkin s idea@xcite holds fast to some components of einstein s equations , while giving up others .",
    "barrow s criticism too has recourse to einstein s equations",
    ". it would be nice to develop sorkin s idea in its full generality using stochastic differential equations to replace einstein s equations and _ then _ try to rule it out convincingly by using cmbr obervations and improved supernova data which may become available in the future @xcite    one observable quantity which could be used to confront theory with experiment is the _ spectrum _ of fluctuation .",
    "the power spectrum of surface tension fluctuations is easily explored using computer techniques as well as analytical calculations@xcite .",
    "this information is contained in the fourier transform of the two point correlation functions @xmath141 .",
    "since @xmath13 has spacetime dependent fluctuations , one could expect that its spectrum of fluctuations @xcite can also be calculated from @xmath142 . since the spectrum of metric fluctuations is well constrained by cmbr observations",
    ", this could provide a confrontation between theory and experiment",
    ". there may be aspects of the spectrum that are specific and depend on the microscopic theory , in which case the observations may be used to rule out candidate quantum theories of gravitation . on the other hand",
    "if the predictions are generic and independent of the microscopic theory , a conflict with observations would cast a shadow of doubt on the whole venture of quantum gravity .",
    "the @xmath13 fluctuations may be accessible by numerical quantum gravity , a developing area in which there is considerable current interest .",
    "there is much work @xcite that explores quantum gravity on a computer using dynamical triangulations and spin networks . just as we are able to see fluctuating @xmath36 in fluid membranes by numerical experiments , it should be possible to see fluctuating @xmath13 in numerical quantum gravity .",
    "apart from the magnitude of the effect , it should also be possible to work out the _ spectrum _ of fluctuations , which is an imporant observable quantity .",
    "our work suggests that by using computer methods like dynamical triangulations it should be possible to see effects of fluctuating @xmath13 in every approach to quantum gravity .",
    "it is also perhaps true that the simulation methods are more highly developed in condensed matter physics than in numerical quantum gravity .",
    "techniques analogous to dpd which improve the efficiency of computer runs may be a useful import into numerical quantum gravity .",
    "the smooth picture we have of spacetime in gr may yield in quantum gravity to some discrete microscopic structure .",
    "such views about geometry and spacetime were expressed very early by riemann and einstein ( see @xcite ) .",
    "riemann in his inaugural lecture on geometry discusses continuous manifolds as well as discrete ones , evidently regarding the latter as more natural .",
    "`` .. their quantitative comparison happens for discrete manifolds through counting , for continuous one through measurement . ''",
    "einstein , in a letter to to dllenbach , ( 1916 ) says `` ... but you have correctly grasped the drawback that the continuum brings . if the molecular view of matter is the appropriate one , i.e. , if a part of the universe is to be represented by a finite number of moving points , then the continuum of the present theory contains too great a manifold of possibilities .",
    "i also believe that this too great is responsible for the fact that our present means of description miscarry with the quantum theory .",
    "the problem seems to me how one can formulate statements about a discontinuum without calling upon a continuum ... ''    it may be as riemann and einstein anticipated that the spacetime continuum emerges only in the low energy approximation that is accessible to us through our feeble probes .",
    "our best particle accelerators today are but coarse instruments by planck scale standards , reminiscent of optical microscopes in nanophysics .",
    "the underlying discreteness of spacetime resists our best efforts , just as atoms escaped detection for two millenia from the time of democritus .",
    "if they are numerous enough , discrete points ( atoms of matter or of spacetime ) can appear continuous as the stars on the milky way .",
    "to get at the underlying discreteness , our best chance may be to look at emergent _ fluctuation _ effects .",
    "this is the main lesson we have learned from einstein s work on brownian motion and the main point of this paper .",
