    "inflation , which consists of a period of accelerated expansion prior to the conventional radiation and matter dominated epochs , provides the most compelling framework to address the homogeneity , flatness , and monopole problems of the standard big bang cosmology ( see e.g. @xcite for pioneering work , and @xcite for important earlier work ) .",
    "over the past decade cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observations have confirmed basic predictions of inflation and in addition have provided stringent tests of individual inflationary models .",
    "first , generic predictions of inflation match the observations : the universe has a critical density ( @xmath16 ) , the density perturbation spectrum is nearly scale invariant , and superhorizon fluctuations are evident .",
    "second , current data differentiate between inflationary models and rule some of them out @xcite .",
    "inflation models predict two types of perturbations , scalar and tensor , which result in density and gravitational wave fluctuations , respectively .",
    "each of them is typically characterized by a fluctuation amplitude ( @xmath17 for scalar and @xmath18 for tensor , with the latter usually given in terms of the ratio @xmath19 ) and a spectral index ( @xmath20 for scalar and @xmath21 for tensor ) describing the mild scale dependence of the fluctuation amplitudes .",
    "the amplitude @xmath17 is normalized by the height of the inflationary potential . for single - field slow - roll models ,",
    "the inflationary consistency condition @xmath22 further reduces the number of free parameters to two , leaving experimental limits on @xmath20 and @xmath2 as the primary means of distinguishing among inflationary models .",
    "hence , predictions of models are presented as plots in the @xmath7 plane .",
    "previous works have investigated the shifts induced in the @xmath20 and/or @xmath2 inflationary parameters caused by our poor understanding of the early - universe physics ( _ i.e. _ the reheating process  @xcite ) or the late - time universe evolution ( as , for instance , the precise reionization details  @xcite ) . in this context , neutrino properties , which play a role in both early and late stages of our universe , show important correlations with the inflationary parameters @xcite .",
    "indeed assumptions about the neutrino properties may bias the extraction of inflationary parameters and hence lead to incorrect conclusions about which inflationary potentials match the data @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study the effects of three neutrino properties that are particularly important in this regard : the neutrino hierarchy , the total neutrino mass , and the contribution of neutrinos to the total radiation content through the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom at recombination @xmath5 .",
    "_ neutrino hierarchy : _ while from neutrino oscillation experiments we know that at least two out of the three standard model active neutrino species are massive , we do not know their precise hierarchical structure nor the total absolute value of the neutrino masses , as oscillation measurements only provide information on the splittings between the three neutrino mass eigenstates , see e.g. refs .",

    "the sign of the largest mass splitting , the atmospheric mass gap @xmath23 , remains unknown .",
    "the two possibilities , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , have been dubbed as normal ( nh ) and inverted ( ih ) hierarchies , respectively .",
    "we will consider both possibilities .",
    "we shall compare this novel approach to previous approximations , described in what follows .",
    "previous work in the literature made the simplifying assumptions of ( a ) two massless neutrinos ( a proxy for the normal hierarchy case when the total neutrino mass is fixed to the minimal value allowed by oscillation experiments ) or ( b ) three degenerate neutrinos ( which is a good approximation as long as the total neutrino mass is much higher than the minimal mass , see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "clearly these assumptions do not match the real world , since we know from oscillation experiments that at least two of the active species are massive .",
    "hence it is the goal of this paper to reexamine constraints on inflation , with the measured mass splittings , studying precisely the nh and ih scenarios .",

    "the quoted bound can be further tightened down to @xmath28 0.12 - 0.15 ev by adding power spectrum ( matter or ly-@xmath29 ) data and/or by considering a prior on the hubble parameter , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "] however , these bounds have made a few assumptions , which we relax in this paper .",
    "in particular , they have been obtained by assuming three degenerate neutrinos of equal mass .",

    "number of relativistic species at recombination : _ third , neutrino abundances , settled around the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) period , may differ from their canonical expectation .",
    "if any of the neutrino species contributes a different amount to the radiation content of the universe , then the epoch of matter / radiation equality may shift , leading to shifts in the predictions for @xmath1 that would cause misinterpretation of cmb data in terms of underlying inflationary models . the number of relativistic degrees of freedom @xmath5 at the time of recombination ( _ i.e. _ the quantity which the cmb is sensitive to ) may serve as a proxy for this effect .",

    "in this section , we provide a detailed description of the statistical tools and datasets employed for drawing our results .",
    "we also define the various cases we are treating with regards to a variety of possibilities for the spectrum of neutrino masses , the total neutrino mass , and @xmath5 .",

    "in addition to this standard set of parameters , we also consider ( not necessarily at the same time ) the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath2 ( measured at the same pivot scale as the scalar perturbations ) , the total neutrino mass @xmath46 ( where the index @xmath4 runs over the three neutrino mass eigenstates ) , the neutrino hierarchy , and the number of relativistic degrees of freedom @xmath5 . in the * baseline model * , these additional parameters are taken to be @xmath30 , @xmath47   in different cosmological analyses ( for example , those carried out by the planck collaboration ) . ] and @xmath32 .",
    "the inclusion of massive neutrinos is performed by considering different hierarchical scenarios and also different priors on the total neutrino mass , in order to test their possible impact on the inflationary observables .",
    "we will compare the regions in the @xmath0 plane obtained by using the standard approximate assumptions used throughout the literature in contrast with the regions obtained by using correct information about neutrino masses from oscillations data .",
    "we first consider the two standard approximate assumptions of :    \\i ) * `` 1 + 2 '' case * : a single massive eigenstate with mass @xmath48 , plus two massless eigenstates , when the total mass is fixed ii ) * `` 3deg '' case * : fully degenerate scenario of three massive eigenstates with mass @xmath49 each , when the total mass is allowed to vary freely , provided @xmath50 .",
    "these two approximations mimic what is done in the planck papers ( and usually in the literature ) when models with fixed or varying neutrino mass are analyzed ( apart from the slightly different value of @xmath13 in the fixed mass case , see footnote 3 ) .",
    "these two cases are `` unphysical '' in that they do not match the correct values of neutrino mass as determined by oscillations data , yet up to now they have served as reasonable approximations",
    ". the question is at which point the data will become so good that these approximations are no longer adequate .",
    "then we compare the results arising from these approximate parameterizations with those obtained by implementing the exact neutrino mass hierarchy , either in the normal ( labeled as `` * nh * '' ) or inverted ( `` * ih * '' ) hierarchy scenarios . from neutrino oscillation data , @xmath51 and @xmath52",
    "are the eigenstates which are closer in mass , while the sign of @xmath53 determines the neutrino mass ordering ( nh vs ih case ) .",
    "thus , when using this `` exact '' parameterization , we sample over the lightest eigenstate ( @xmath51 for nh or @xmath54 for ih ) , instead of sampling over @xmath13 , and compute the mass carried by the remaining eigenstates by means of the mass squared differences @xmath55 measured by oscillation experiments . in particular , we use the results of the global fit reported in ref .  @xcite .",
    "notice that , with this exact parameterization for the neutrino mass eigenstates , at least two out of the three of them are massive . as a result , when marginalizing over the total mass , the prior naturally imposed by oscillation measurements is @xmath56 , where @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) in the nh ( ih ) case .",
    "this is different from the prior imposed in the approximate case and this difference should be kept in mind when comparing results from the two parameterizations in the following sections , because of possible volume effects , on which we shall comment on later .    for what concerns the effective number of relativistic species , when sampling over @xmath5 , we firstly impose a broad flat prior in the range @xmath59 .",
    "in addition , we also report results when considering the case of a hard prior @xmath60 , as expected for example in low - reheating scenarios  @xcite , where the reheating temperature @xmath34 can be as low as @xmath61(mev ) . in both cases of the broad and hard prior on @xmath5",
    ", we treat the difference @xmath62 between the value of @xmath5 into consideration and the standard expected value of @xmath63 in the following way : @xmath64 is considered as a massless neutrino contribution , _",
    "i.e. _ as an `` extra - radiation '' component ; when @xmath65 , we instead rescale the ( three ) active neutrino temperature accordingly to @xmath5 , _",
    "i.e. _ the neutrino number density is rescaled by a factor @xmath66 .",
    "the neutrino density @xmath67 for a given total mass is then rescaled by the same factor .      as our baseline dataset , we employ the full planck 2015 measurements of the cmb anisotropies in temperature complemented with large - scale polarization  @xcite ( we refer to this combination as `` planck tt+lowp '' ) .",
    "we conservatively avoid use of small - scale polarization , since it could be still affected by a small amount of residual systematics  @xcite .",
    "we also combine planck data with the most recent degree - scale measurements of the bb power spectrum from the bicep / keck collaboration  @xcite ( bk14 ) and with geometrical bao information from the galaxy surveys boss - dr11  @xcite , the 6df  @xcite and the mgs  @xcite .",
    "in addition to deriving parameter estimates from current cosmological data , we also perform forecasts for future cmb experiments .",

    "in this section , we discuss the impact of massive neutrino properties , namely the total neutrino mass , its hierarchical distribution among massive neutrino eigenstates and the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom at recombination , on the recovered value of the scalar spectral index @xmath20 , in light of current cosmological data .",
    "we firstly focus on the comparison between the results arising from the baseline model ( @xmath27 ) and its one - parameter extension @xmath69 , provided @xmath30 .",
    "we then perform an analogous comparison allowing also for a non - vanishing tensor component , parameterized via the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath2 , to vary freely . notice that in these cases we fix @xmath5 to the standard value of 3.046 .",
    "we shall discuss separately the effect of relaxing our assumptions about @xmath5 .",
    "in analogy to the cases depicted above , we shall thus compare the results from @xmath70 and @xmath71 fixing @xmath30 .",
    "we then move to investigate the impact of varying the tensor - to - scalar ratio .",
    "as anticipated above , in this section we will fix the tensor - to - scalar ratio to zero and compare results coming from the baseline model and its one - parameter extension @xmath69 .",

    "we notice an overall agreement of the constraints on @xmath20 when different models and/or datasets are taken into account . however , small departures and @xmath73 error @xmath74 ( with @xmath75 ) in units of @xmath12 , we quote the following quantity : @xmath76 . in the case",
    "when the 68% cl is not symmetric around the mean , we take the half width of the same range as an estimate for @xmath74 . ]",
    " at the level of a few fractions of @xmath12 from the mean value obtained for the @xmath27 model are observed , which can be explained in terms of physical effects of the neutrino background on cosmological observables , on which we shall comment thouroughly in this section .",
    "the aim of this section is threefold : namely , we want i ) to study the effect of the neutrino mass splittings as well as ii ) to assess the impact of the marginalization over the total neutrino mass ( as opposed to fixing the mass to a given value ) , focusing mostly on the estimates of the scalar spectral index @xmath1 , and iii ) provide a thorough physical explanation underlying the observed shifts in the scalar spectral index . in this section",
    "we will then focus on the standard @xmath31cdm scenario ( with a total neutrino mass fixed to @xmath77 ) and on its one - parameter extension , in which @xmath13 is allowed to vary freely and marginalized over , dubbed as @xmath31cdm+@xmath13 . in the context of bayesian analysis , the marginalization over one parameter allows to take into account any possible effect whose imprecise knowledge could have on the determination of the remaining parameters of the model .",
    "these effects , such as bias in the recovered mean values and/or broadening of the confidence levels , may be otherwise hidden by fixing the unknown parameter to a specific value .",
    "we shall consider different parameterizations for the splittings of the total neutrino mass among the mass eigenstates .",
    "in particular , we compare results considering the exact mass distribution according to the nh scenario on one side , with those arising from the usual approximations .",
    "these approximations consist in : either a single massive eigenstate carrying the total mass , fixed to the minimum value allowed by neutrino oscillation measurements , and two massless eigenstates ( `` 1 + 2 '' scenario , for @xmath27 and generically all those models where the total neutrino mass is fixed to the minimum value allowed by oscillations ) , or three fully degenerate massive neutrinos ( `` 3deg '' , for @xmath69 and generically all those models where the total neutrino mass is allowed to vary freely and not fixed to any specific value ) , on the other side .    for the sake of comparison , we also report results derived from assuming an exact distribution according to the inverted hierarchy ( ih ) scenario for some specific models analyzed in this work .",
    "however , we choose to mainly focus on the nh case , which seems to be slightly preferred by current cosmological limits on @xmath13 ( a combination of cosmological measurements is close to disfavour @xmath78 , where @xmath58 is the minimal mass allowed by oscillation measurements in the inverted hierarchy scenario , at @xmath79 @xcite ) and very mildly preferred by the latest neutrino oscillation data  @xcite .    in comparing the results arising from the different assumptions listed above",
    ", we would like to highlight possible deviations in the recovered mean value of @xmath20 due to a different neutrino scenario , possibly hinting at some sensitivity from current cosmological data to the neutrino mass splittings .    in tab .",
    "[ tab : ns_lcdm ] , we compare constraints on @xmath20 obtained in the context of the @xmath27 model , with the total neutrino mass fixed to the minimum value allowed by oscillations , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath48 , with those obtained for the @xmath69 model , after marginalization over @xmath13 .",
    "we test any model against the planck tt+lowp data alone and in combination with bao .",
    "table  [ tab : ns_lcdm ] also contains information about the comparison between different mass splittings , labeled as nh for normal hierarchy and `` approx '' for either `` 1 + 2 '' or `` 3deg '' .",
    "we shall focus on this comparison firstly .",
    "notice that , for each model and dataset combination , the two mass parameterizations do not provide precisely the same constraints .",
    "focusing on the @xmath27 scenario , the shift in the mean value of @xmath1 is negligible and we can not exclude a statistical fluctuation of the mcmc analysis as a valid explanation .",
    "however , we notice that for the two combinations of data sets considered , the shift is going in the same direction , _ i.e. _ lowering the value of @xmath20 when the nh parameterization is used . in the @xmath69 scenario , the shift in @xmath20 between the two parameterizations is more pronounced , albeit it is still small , at the level of @xmath80 .",
    "interestingly , the direction of the shift is opposite for this model if one tests it against different combination of datasets . in particular , considering planck tt+lowp alone , @xmath20 increases going from nh to `` 3deg '' ( compare first and second rows in the @xmath69 column of tab.[tab : ns_lcdm ] ) .",
    "in contrast , @xmath20 decreases going from nh to `` 3deg '' , when the combination of planck tt+lowp+bao is employed ( compare third and fourth rows in the @xmath69 column of tab.[tab : ns_lcdm ] ) . in both cases ,",
    "the nature of the shift is found in the correlation arising between @xmath20 and @xmath13 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dnsmnu ] for the `` 3deg '' parameterization ( nh provides similar contours ) and discussed below .",
    "concerning cmb measurements alone , the increase in @xmath20 when moving from nh to `` 3deg '' arises from the fact that the power in the damping tail can be kept approximately constant by increasing @xmath13 ( enhancing power in the tail by suppressing structures and hence the lensing potential ) and decreasing @xmath1 ( thus tilting the spectrum to give less power to the small scales ) . since the posterior distribution for @xmath13 starts from zero in the `` 3deg '' case , while for the nh scenario values below @xmath81 are not allowed for @xmath13 , the center of mass of the posterior distribution for @xmath13 is shifted to larger values in the latter case with respect to the former .",
    "given the correlation between @xmath13 and @xmath20 discussed just above , this yields a smaller value for @xmath20 in the nh case .",
    "in fact , we have checked that we are able to reduce significantly the shift if we impose a hard prior of @xmath82 also in the `` 3deg '' case , making clear that this is mainly a volume effect .",
    "notice that @xmath20 and @xmath13 are anti - correlated ( _ i.e. _ higher values of @xmath13 correspond to lower values of @xmath20 ) when planck tt+lowp data are used . in contrast ,",
    "the two parameters are positively correlated when bao information are added to cmb data , as clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dnsmnu ] . as an example , the correlation coefficient defined as @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the covariance matrix of cosmological parameters and @xmath85 , changes from @xmath86 ( implying negative correlation ) for planck tt+lowp to @xmath87 ( implying positive correlation ) when bao measurements are added .",
    "an explanation for the aforementioned degeneracies when bao data are added can be found by studying the physical effect of neutrino masses on the quantities constrained by baos .",
    "recall bao data constrain the ratio @xmath88 , where @xmath89 denotes the sound horizon at the drag epoch ( _ i.e. _ the epoch at which baryons decouple from photons , slightly after recombination , when photon pressure is no longer available to prevent gravitational instability ) , and @xmath90 is a distance combination . in particular , @xmath90 is a combination of the line - of - sight comoving distance related to the hubble parameter @xmath91 , and the transverse comoving distance @xmath92 : is related to the angular diameter distance @xmath93 via the relation @xmath94 . ]",

    "as @xmath99 decreases , @xmath100 increases and correspondingly both @xmath101 and @xmath102 decrease .",
    "this behaviour explains why bao data , by excluding lower ( higher ) values of @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) , exclude the region associated to higher @xmath96 and correspondingly , prefer higher values of @xmath1 . in this way",
    ", the anti - correlation between @xmath96 and @xmath1 present when cmb data alone is employed , is reverted .",
    "further discussions on these effects can be found in  @xcite .",
    "we will now focus on the comparison between the recovered values of @xmath20 for a given hierarchy , _",
    "i.e. _ we discuss possible deviations due to a different choice of the cosmological model ( either @xmath27 or the one - parameter extension @xmath69 ) and/or dataset combination .",
    "marginalizing over the total neutrino mass introduces shifts in @xmath20 with respect to the @xmath27 model , meaning that the unknown value of the total neutrino mass may play a non - negligible role in recovering the exact constraints on the scalar spectral index .",
    "the shift in @xmath20 due to the marginalization over @xmath13 goes in the direction of lowering @xmath20 if the models are tested against cmb only ( @xmath11 in the nh case and @xmath104 in the `` 3deg '' case , with respect to the @xmath27 model ) , while it goes in the opposite direction when bao data are also considered ( @xmath104 in the nh case and @xmath105 in the `` 3deg '' case , with respect to the @xmath27 model ) .",
    "we have already seen that the addition of bao data is , in general , responsible for an increase in @xmath20 , quantified in @xmath104 in the @xmath27 scenario and @xmath106 in the @xmath69 scenario , with respect to the equivalent values obtained with the planck tt+lowp datasets only , almost independently on the choice of the mass splitting .",
    "the reason for these shifts , extensively discussed above , is related to degeneracies arising between @xmath20 , the hubble constant @xmath102 and the matter density @xmath103 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tri ] for the @xmath69 model ( a similar figure is obtained for the @xmath27 model ) .",

    "the two columns refer to the following two cases : ( i ) the first column , dubbed as standard @xmath27 scenario has a total neutrino mass fixed to @xmath48 and ( ii ) the second column , dubbed as @xmath69 is for a one - parameter extension in which @xmath13 is free to vary ( @xmath50 for  approx \" i.e.  3deg \" case and @xmath119 ev for the nh case ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have investigated here the robustness of the constraints on the scalar spectral index @xmath20 under various assumptions about neutrino properties , by employing a combination of cmb and bao data in the context of a @xmath27 model and other possible extensions .",
    "in particular , we have considered the impact of marginalizing over the total neutrino mass @xmath13 , under different choices for the neutrino mass splittings .",
    "we have compared the results arising from assuming either an approximate neutrino mass - splitting ( one massive eigenstate carrying the total mass plus two massless species when the total mass is fixed to the minimal - mass case , @xmath48 , and three degenerate massive neutrinos otherwise ) as usually done in literature , or the exact mass - splitting ( normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchies ) .",
    "we have found that the assumptions about the mass splittings play a negligible role in the context of current cosmological measurements .",
    "however , when values of the neutrino mass different from the minimal mass of @xmath120 are taken into account , the spectral index is slightly shifted .",
    "adopted in the two cases ( @xmath78 , with @xmath121 in the exact parameterization but @xmath122 for the approximate parametrization ) .",
    "] this is due to a mild inverse degeneracy between the two parameters , induced by the strong degeneracy between @xmath13 , the hubble constant @xmath102 and the matter density @xmath103 .",
    "these degeneracies can be strongly alleviated by the addition of bao measurements .",
    "we have also tested the effect of considering a free number of relativistic degrees of freedom @xmath5 and found that the scalar spectral index is considerably lowered when @xmath37 , as expected in the context of low - reheating temperature scenarios ( @xmath123 , subjected to @xmath124 in order to satisfy bbn bounds  @xcite ) . this shift in @xmath20",
    "is mostly driven by the strong degeneracy between @xmath5 , @xmath20 and @xmath102 .",
    "this preference is mildly alleviated by the inclusion of bao data , which are able to exclude low values of @xmath102 .",
    "on purpose , given the highly discussed tension with the cmb determination of the same quantity ( see @xcite and references therein ) . however , we can qualitatively comment on the possible effect of including priors from the local measurements of the hubble constant : the aforementioned priors , preferring preferring values of the hubble constant @xmath102 higher than those predicted by cmb and bao data , would go in the direction of favoring , on average , higher values of @xmath20 , given the direct degeneracy between the two parameters .",
    "in addition , it would also lower the upper bound on @xmath13 and increase the value of @xmath5 , favouring again higher values of @xmath20 . ]",
    "we have also allowed for a non - vanishing tensor component in the analyses ( namely , we have investigated @xmath125 models and discussed extensions ) , finding that the inclusion of non - vanishing tensor modes is responsible for slightly increasing @xmath20 with respect to the corresponding bounds with @xmath30 .",
    "the dependence of the constraints of @xmath20 on neutrino properties , especially in extended @xmath125 scenarios , is crucial for assessing the significance at which inflationary models can be excluded with cosmological data . as an example , @xmath126 agreement between the predictions from the cosine natural inflation paradigm with planck tt+lowp+bk14+bao data can be recovered in exotic reheating scenarios with @xmath127 .",
    "in addition , it will not be possible to exclude the model with future cmb data alone , if one performs forecasts of future cmb missions such as core and stage - iv by assuming a fiducial model with @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "similar considerations hold for the km variant of natural inflation , as well as for higgs - like models of inflation .",
    "a precise determination of both the mean value and the error budget associated to a determination of @xmath20 by including all the possible sources of uncertainties is therefore a mandatory analysis .",
    "the very same forecasts of future cmb missions discussed above show that constraints on @xmath20 can be altered by more than @xmath14 if uncertainties related to our incomplete knowledge of the neutrino properties ( _ i.e. _ the precise value of the total mass and exact number of relativistic degrees of freedom ) are not taken into account properly .",
    "this is crucial for upcoming experiments aiming at the discovery of the inflationary paradigm , given the claimed precision at which they would be able to constrain the inflationary sector .",

    "<S> we study the impact of assumptions about neutrino properties on the estimation of inflationary parameters from cosmological data , with a specific focus on the allowed contours in the @xmath0 plane , where @xmath1 is the scalar spectral index and @xmath2 is the tensor to scalar ratio . </S>",
    "<S> we study the following neutrino properties : ( i ) the total neutrino mass @xmath3 ( where the index @xmath4 runs over the three neutrino mass eigenstates ) ; ( ii ) the number of relativistic degrees of freedom @xmath5 at the time of recombination ; and ( iii ) the neutrino hierarchy : whereas previous literature assumed 3 degenerate neutrino masses or two massless neutrino species ( approximations that clearly do not match neutrino oscillation data ) , we study the cases of normal and inverted hierarchy . </S>",
    "<S> our basic result is that these three neutrino properties induce @xmath6 shift of the probability contours in the @xmath7 plane with both current or upcoming data . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the choice of neutrino hierarchy ( normal , inverted , or degenerate ) has a negligible impact . </S>",
    "<S> however , the minimal cutoff on the total neutrino mass @xmath8 that accompanies previous works using the degenerate hierarchy does introduce biases in the @xmath7 plane and should be replaced by @xmath9 as required by oscillation data . </S>",
    "<S> using current cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data from planck and bicep / keck ( bk14 ) , marginalizing over the total neutrino mass @xmath10 and over @xmath2 can lead to a shift in the mean value of @xmath1 of @xmath11 towards lower values . </S>",
    "<S> however , once baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) measurements are included , the standard contours in the @xmath0 plane are basically reproduced . </S>",
    "<S> larger shifts of the contours in the @xmath0 plane ( up to 0.8@xmath12 ) arise for nonstandard values of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide forecasts for the future cmb experiments core ( satellite ) and stage - iv ( ground - based ) and show that the incomplete knowledge of neutrino properties , taken into account by a marginalization over @xmath13 , could induce a shift of @xmath14 towards lower values in the determination of @xmath1 ( or a @xmath15 shift if one marginalizes over @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> comparison to specific inflationary models is shown . </S>",
    "<S> imperfect knowledge of neutrino properties must be taken into account properly , given the desired precision in determining whether or not inflationary models match the future data . </S>"
