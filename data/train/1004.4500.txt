    "this emerging field of molecular thermoelectrics  @xcite is also interesting for applications .",
    "molecules have been predicted to be particularly efficient for conversion of heat into electric energy  @xcite ( or analogously for cooling , using electric energy to pump heat ) , the reason being their very sharp electronic resonances when weakly coupled to electrodes  @xcite .",
    "this is similar to the large thermoelectric efficiency of e.g. , semi - conducting nanowires with highly peaked densities of states  @xcite .",
    "most theoretical works on meso- and nano - scale thermoelectrics have focused on the _ linear , equilibrium _ regime , where one operates close to the small voltage @xmath0 which exactly cancels the current induced by the small thermal bias @xmath1 . here the thermopower ( or seebeck coefficient ) @xmath2 is the decisive quantity , where ( @xmath3 ) @xmath4 is the ( thermal ) conductance . a large efficiency @xmath5 of the device operated as a heat to electric energy converter is then related to a large dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the operating temperature and @xmath8 the thermal conductance . in bulk systems",
    ", @xmath9 is normally limited by the wiedemann - franz law , stating that @xmath10 is a system independent constant . however , the wiedemann - franz law is a result of fermi - liquid theory and breaks down in mesoscopic and nanoscopic systems , e.g. , due to large coulomb interaction , as has been demonstrated for quantum dots  @xcite and metallic islands  @xcite , allowing much larger values of @xmath9 to be reached .",
    "as @xmath11 , the efficiency approaches the ideal carnot value @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "however , in the linear regime , @xmath13 , the efficiency stays low even if @xmath9 can be made very large : @xmath14 .",
    "the _ non - linear _ thermoelectric properties of molecular junctions are therefore of great interest .",
    "recent experiments  @xcite probing the thermopower of thiol end - capped organic molecules showed non - linearities in the measured @xmath15 already at @xmath16 .",
    "earlier measurements of thermopower in metallic island single - electron transistors even displayed a change of the sign of the thermopower for very large @xmath1  @xcite .    in the interesting regime of sharp electronic resonances ,",
    "the electron tunnel coupling @xmath17 is small and the main factor limiting the efficiency of molecular energy converters is expected to be the heat current from phonon exchange with rate @xmath18  @xcite . nonetheless , to our knowledge",
    ", its effect has this far not been systematically investigated . only by making the tunnel coupling larger , @xmath19",
    ", the phonon contribution to the heat current becomes negligible . in this case , however , the efficiency becomes instead limited by the large electronic life - time broadening of the molecular resonances .",
    "the thermoelectric efficiency in this limit of coherent transport was studied very recently in the non - linear regime  @xcite using both a many - body transport approach and a ( non - interacting ) approach based on hckel theory . except for the latter work and a few others  @xcite , most theoretical studies of molecular thermoelectrics have focused on non - interacting models , using a landauer type approach . however , in the regime of weak tunnel coupling between molecule and electrodes , intra - molecular interactions typically constitute the largest energy scales of the problem .    in this paper , we calculate the thermoelectric efficiency and converted electric power of a molecular device , including a single dominant molecular orbital , strong coulomb interaction and coupling to a discrete vibrational mode , as well as coupling to lead phonons and lead electrons .",
    "importantly , we include on equal footing the phonon and electron contributions to the heat current , both of which contribute in establishing the stationary occupation of the molecular vibrational mode .",
    "the coulomb repulsion and electron - vibration coupling on the molecule are treated non - perturbatively in the limit of weak electron and phonon exchange in which thermoelectric efficiency is high .",
    "a central finding is that optimal thermoelectric operation typically is achieved in the _ non - linear , non - equilibrium _ regime .",
    "here concepts of figure of merit and thermopower are no longer meaningful and the molecular occupancies , efficiency and output power must be explicitly calculated .",

    "despite polarization and screening effects in molecular junctions  @xcite , the electronic level - spacing in molecular devices is typically large compared to applied voltage- and temperature - bias .",

    "almost all decrease in efficiency in this case comes from the coupling to substrate phonon modes .",
    "in contrast , a vibrational mode with a frequency much larger than the involved temperature- and voltage - bias , does not contribute at all to electron or heat transport ( other than through the trivial shift of the electronic parameters @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath187 through the electron - vibration coupling ) .",
    "finally , we mention that in the simple model analyzed here , the strength of the coulomb interaction does not play a crucial role . in the presence of a coupling to substrate phonons , reducing",
    "@xmath188 leads to a somewhat larger efficiency ( and output power ) as the electric current is increased by the presence of another `` transport channel '' .",
    "we have analyzed the efficiency and output power of a non - linear molecular thermoelectric device operated as a power converter .",
    "accounting for the molecular vibration and its coupling to substrate phonons turned out to be crucial in comparison with results for quantum dot models without these , as it qualitatively changes the operating conditions for optimal efficiency away from the equilibrium regime . by investigating a generic model system we can now identify some basic criteria for efficient molecular energy converters :    _ ( i ) _",
    "the coupling between substrate phonon modes and molecular vibrations should be asymmetric and minimal .",
    "coupling more strongly to the colder lead reduces the molecular temperature and allows operation at higher temperature - bias , improving efficiency and output power .    _",
    "( ii ) _ the electron tunnel couplings should be symmetric , @xmath189 .",
    "furthermore , they should be small as to minimize the life - time broadening , but still larger than the phonon coupling , @xmath190 .    _",
    "( iii ) _ the local electron - vibration coupling energy should be small compared to the zero - point energy of the vibrational mode ( @xmath191 ) .",
    "this is most crucial for vibrational modes with frequencies around the operating temperatures and voltages .",
    "modes with much higher frequencies do not contribute at all , and those with much lower frequencies only contribute to the heat loss through the coupling to substrate phonons .    _",
    "( iv ) _ ideal operating conditions for high efficiency and power is achieved when the conducting orbital energy is at a few @xmath192 from the fermi edges of the electrodes ( @xmath193  mev at room temperature ) .",
    "control of the thermopower by adding electron donating or withdrawing groups to benzenedithiol molecules , thereby shifting the position of the homo and lumo , was recently demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "the temperature - bias should be chosen as high as is allowed by molecular stability and the heat source .",
    "the ideal voltage - bias depends on the other parameters , but is nearly the same when optimizing output power as when optimizing efficiency .",
    "additionally , the efficiency at maximum power is very close to the maximum efficiency .",
    "the general insights obtained in this exhaustive study of the most basic molecular thermoelectric model can serve as a guide for more complex molecular modeling , incorporating multiple vibrational modes , multiple electronic states , breakdown of the born - oppenheimer picture ( pseudo jahn - teller mixing  @xcite ) , etc .",
    "in general , one expects deviations from a single - orbital model to give a less efficient energy - converter , as additional heat is lost by population of excited states .",
    "it might however be possible to find special circumstances under which excited states can instead be desirable , e.g. , by effectively cooling the vibrational mode .",
    "atomistic studies of specific configurations of molecules , anchoring groups and electrodes may identify suitable systems which satisfy the above criteria and thereby further assist in advancing the chemical engineering of molecular thermoelectric junctions . for device applications , engineering of molecular monolayer devices , rather than ones based on a single molecule ,",
    "presents a challenge to supramolecular chemistry , nanodevice fabrication and surface science .",
    "we acknowledge financial support from the dfg under contract no . spp-1243 ( m.  l. , m.  w ) and the european union under the fp7 strep program single ( m.  l. , k.  f. ) .",
