    "recently , there have been considerable developments as regards large field inflation with plateau - like inflaton potentials , driven by the models compatibility with observational data  @xcite and their ties to supergravity and string theory  @xcite@xcite . on the theoretical side it has , for example ,",
    "been shown that such models naturally arise from phenomenological supergravity .",
    "the underlying hyperbolic geometry of the moduli space and the flatness of the khler potential in the inflation direction is conveniently described in terms of a field variable @xmath4 , which gives rise to a kinetic term in the lagrangian with a pole at the boundary of the moduli space . by making a transformation to a canonical variable @xmath5 ,",
    "the moduli space near its boundary becomes stretched , leading to an inflationary potential @xmath6 with an asymptotic plateau - like form for @xmath6 .",
    "this stretching results in predictions that are quite insensitive to the original form of the potential @xmath7 . in particular this leads to universal properties in @xmath8 diagrams , which motivates calling these models @xmath0-attractors , where @xmath0 is a constant parameter describing the exponential asymptotic flattening of the potential @xmath6 in the einstein frame .",
    "it should be noted that this theoretical perspective unifies and contextualizes results for several previous models such as the starobinski and the higgs inflation models . for additional intriguing aspects such as couplings to other fields with couplings which become exponentially small for large fields @xmath5 , as well as further background discussions ,",
    "see  @xcite@xcite .",
    "we take the einstein frame formulation as our starting point and restrict the discussion to the flat , spatially homogeneous , isotropic friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) spacetimes .",
    "we thereby consider the following field equations for a canonically normalized inflaton field @xmath5 with a potential @xmath6 : . ]",
    "[ fieldeq ] @xmath9    where @xmath10 ; an overdot signifies the derivative with respect to synchronous proper time , @xmath11 ; @xmath12 is the hubble variable , where @xmath13 is the cosmological scale factor , with evolution equation @xmath14 , which decouples from the above equations .",
    "furthermore , our focus will be on @xmath1- and @xmath2-models defined by the potentials    [ pot ] @xmath15    with @xmath16 , respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pot ] ) .",
    "the modest aim in this paper is to present a dynamical systems formulation that allows us to give a complete global classical description of the solution spaces of the above models , including asymptotic properties , illustrated with pictures describing compactified two - dimensional state spaces .",
    "our motivation for this is threefold :    * as will be discussed , the above equations and potentials allow one to rather directly get a feeling for the solution space and its properties , but all aspects are not obvious .",
    "it is therefore of value to show how a complete understanding can be obtained in a rigorous manner , especially since this exemplifies how one can address other reminiscent problems .",
    "* by reformulating the problem as a regularized dynamical system on a reduced compactified state space , we provide an example that helps give the dynamical systems community access to inflationary cosmology .",
    "this also makes powerful mathematical tools available to an area where such methods have not , in our opinion , been used to full effect .",
    "for example , as will be shown , the universal inflationary properties of the models are intimately connected with certain aspects concerning center manifolds , which also result in approximation methods complementing heuristic methods such as the slow - roll approximation . *",
    "the present dynamical systems formulation can be adapted so that it can be used in more general contexts such as anisotropic spatially homogeneous cosmology and even for models without any symmetries at all , as shown for perfect fluids in e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "such an extension of the present paper would make it possible to address the issue of initial conditions for inflation in a generic context .",
    "let us now turn to the system  . by treating @xmath17 as an independent variable ,",
    "we obtain a reduced state space ( because the equation for the scale factor @xmath13 decouples ) described by the state vector @xmath18 obeying the constraint  ; i.e. , the problem can be regarded as a two - dimensional dynamical system .",
    "the @xmath1- and @xmath2-models are examples of models with a non - negative potential @xmath6 with a single extremum point , a minimum , conveniently located at @xmath19 , for which @xmath20 . as a consequence",
    "these models admit a minkowski ( fixed point / critical point / equilibrium point ) solution at @xmath21 .",
    "due to  , all other solutions either have a positive or negative @xmath22 .",
    "since we are interested in cosmology we consider @xmath23 .",
    "it follows that @xmath22 is monotonically decreasing since eq .",
    "yields @xmath24 , where @xmath25 requires @xmath26 ; moreover , @xmath17 can not remain zero since @xmath26 implies that @xmath27 , where @xmath28 since we exclude the only extremum point at @xmath29 by assuming that @xmath23 .",
    "thus , the graph of @xmath22 just passes through an inflection point when @xmath26 .",
    "the system   can be discussed in terms of the following heuristic picture : equation   can be interpreted as an equation for a particle of unit mass with a one - dimensional coordinate @xmath5 , moving in a potential @xmath6 with a friction force @xmath30 , while @xmath31 can be viewed as a monotonically decreasing energy in the constraint  .",
    "running backwards in time leads to a particle with ever - increasing energy moving in the potential @xmath6 , where @xmath32 . in combination with the shape of a given potential , this yields an intuitive picture of the dynamics",
    "let us now turn to the specific potentials  .",
    "in the case of the @xmath1- and @xmath2-models both potentials behave as @xmath33 for small @xmath5 .",
    "the potential for the @xmath1-models ( @xmath2-models ) has a plateau given by @xmath34 when @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) , while @xmath37 behaves as @xmath38 when @xmath39 .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath1-models , the potential , and thereby the field equations , of the @xmath2-models exhibits a discrete symmetry under the transformation @xmath40 .",
    "let us begin our heuristic discussion of the dynamics of the @xmath1- and @xmath2-models with dynamics toward the future .",
    "in both cases , if a solution has obtained an `` energy '' @xmath41 it follows straightforwardly that the solution will end up at the minkowski fixed point .",
    "but does it do so by just `` gliding '' down the potential , or does it do so by damped oscillations , i.e. , is the motion of @xmath5 overdamped or underdamped ?",
    "this does not follow from the heuristic particle discussion , but requires further analysis .",
    "attempting to do so by solving the constraint   for @xmath22 , i.e. , by setting @xmath42 in  , leads to an unconstrained two - dimensional dynamical system for @xmath43 .",
    "this system , however , has an unbounded state space and differentiability problems at @xmath44 for potentials that behave as @xmath45 for small @xmath5 .",
    "these problems are of course not insurmountable , but they prevent global pictures of the solution spaces that accurately reflect the asymptotic features of the solutions . nevertheless , it is not difficult to show that the motion is underdamped and that solutions with @xmath41 undergo damped oscillations .",
    "but do all solutions end at the minkowski state , or are there solutions that asymptotically end with an energy @xmath34 at infinitely large @xmath5 ?",
    "in other words , is the minkowski state a global future attractor ? ( as we will see , the answer is `` yes '' for the present potentials . ) one would also perhaps guess that there is a single solution that begins at an infinite value of the scalar field with an initial energy @xmath46 , corresponding to an asymptotic de sitter state , with the solution initially slowly rolling down the potential , which , as we will show , is indeed the case .",
    "what about the past dynamics ? from an inflationary point of view one would perhaps argue that solutions are only physically acceptable with initial data for which @xmath47 .",
    "however , all solutions , except for the single one coming from the de sitter plateau with an initially infinite scalar field , originate from @xmath32 . one",
    "might then take the viewpoint that the previous evolution of solutions before @xmath47 is physically irrelevant .",
    "however , all this assumes that the inflationary scenario is correct and prevents investigations that either justify this or cast doubt on it .",
    "moreover , even if this is assumed to be correct , one still wants approximations for the solutions before the quasi - de sitter stage , as done in , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , where a massless state is used for this purpose .",
    "but this is intimately connected with the limit @xmath32 , so let us therefore consider this limit from the present heuristic perspective .    because the potential   is symmetric and bounded , the heuristic description of the dynamics of the @xmath2-models is simpler than that for the @xmath1-models .",
    "we therefore begin with the @xmath2-models .",
    "since the potential in this case is bounded , @xmath48 , it follows from   that the limit @xmath32 implies that @xmath49 and hence that the influence of the potential on the dynamics becomes asymptotically negligible ; i.e. , the asymptotic state is expected to be that of a massless scalar field .",
    "furthermore , we expect two physically equivalent representations associated with @xmath50 toward the past .    for the @xmath1-models",
    "the potential is no longer bounded and this results in a somewhat more complicated situation . nevertheless , toward the past , irrespective of the value of @xmath0",
    ", we would expect an open set of models to approach a massless state toward @xmath35 for similar reasons as for the @xmath1-models .",
    "furthermore , we expect that whether or not all solutions end up there depends on the steepness of the potential in the limit @xmath39 . in this limit",
    "the potential behaves as an exponential , and problems with an exponential can be viewed as scattering a particle against a potential wall if the potential is steep enough ; in such a situation we expect that the massless state with @xmath35 describes the past asymptotic behavior of all solutions . if the potential is not steep enough to accomplish this the situation becomes more complicated .",
    "nevertheless , based on the knowledge of the dynamics of a single exponential one might guess that there is an open set of solutions that approaches a massless state at @xmath51 and that there exists a single solution that approaches this limit in a power - law fashion .",
    "moreover , if the steepness of the exponential limit is sufficiently moderate , we expect this solution to describe an early inflationary power - law state .",
    "although quite helpful , the above heuristic considerations lead to a rather scattered impression of the global dynamics and leave some remaining unanswered questions .",
    "in addition , we have not obtained any quantitative results , and , what is even worse , the heuristic picture runs into increasing problems when trying to use it in more general contexts involving additional degrees of freedom .",
    "in contrast , the dynamical systems formalism presented below is applicable to more general situations than the present one , which rather acts as a pedagogical example . with this in mind",
    "we will now develop a formalism that addresses the above issues and at a glance describes the global situation rigorously , and also makes techniques available for describing quantitatively correct approximations for solutions in the past and future regimes ( indeed , they can be combined to even give global approximations for the solutions to arbitrary accuracy if one is so inclined , see  @xcite ) .    to avoid differentiability problems and to obtain asymptotic approximations and a global picture of the solution space , we change variables .",
    "we do so by following the treatment of monomial potentials @xmath52 in  @xcite and  @xcite , but adapting the formulation to the particular features of the potentials   and  .",
    "we derive three complementary dynamical systems since the global one is not optimal for quantitative descriptions in all parts of the state space ; instead the global picture should be seen as a collecting ground which gives the overall picture .",
    "since the dependent variables are defined in a similar manner for @xmath1- and @xmath2-models , while the independent variables differ , we define the three complementary sets of dependent variables in this section , while the independent variables and the dynamical systems and their analysis will be presented in the subsequent two sections .",
    "we begin by defining the hubble - normalized or , equivalently in the present flat flrw cases , energy density - normalized dimensionless variables ( thereby capturing the physical essence of the problem ) , by making the following variable transformation , @xmath53   is used because @xmath54 , in a multidimensional kaluza - klein perspective , is analogous to hubble - normalized shear in anisotropic cosmology , where @xmath55 is standard notation ; see e.g. ref .",

    "the quantity @xmath59 in   represents the number of @xmath3-folds with respect to some reference time @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "below , for simplicity , we assume that @xmath62 is a positive integer . since @xmath22 is monotonically decreasing it follows that @xmath63 is monotonically increasing .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 . with the above definitions , the gauss constraint   takes the form @xmath67 the state space thereby has a cylinderlike structure ( cylinder structure when @xmath68 ) . the constraint can be solved globally by introducing an angular variable @xmath69 according to    [ thetadef ] @xmath70    which leads to an unconstrained dynamical system for the state vector @xmath71 . for future purposes we note that @xmath72 ( with @xmath73 when @xmath68 ) , and @xmath74 to obtain a bounded ( relatively compact ) state space with state vector @xmath75 , we make the transformation @xmath76 thus",
    ", @xmath77 is monotonically increasing where @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "the deceleration parameter , @xmath81 , is defined and given by @xmath82 to proceed with the choice of independent variables , we treat the @xmath1- and @xmath2-models separately in the following two sections , where we also perform a complete local and global dynamical systems analysis of these models .",
    "we end the paper with some concluding remarks in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] , e.g. about the relationship between the center manifold analysis performed in the two @xmath1- and @xmath2-model sections and the slow - roll approximation .",

    "their intersection , @xmath96 , corresponds to two fixed points @xmath97 .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath94 subset is divided into two disconnected parts by a fixed point @xmath98 located at @xmath99 . due to the regularity of the above equations we can include the invariant boundary , ( @xmath92 for @xmath93 ) @xmath100 ( @xmath94 for @xmath95 ) , which we refer to as the past boundary . indeed",
    ", it is necessary to include this boundary in order to describe past asymptotics since , as will be shown , all solutions originate from the fixed points on this boundary .",
    "note further that the equations on the @xmath92 subset are identical to those for an exponential potential @xmath101 since in this case @xmath102 moreover , the equations on the @xmath103 subset are identical to those that correspond to a constant potential , which can be seen by setting @xmath104 in the above equation .    by globally solving the constraint by using eq .",

    "the structure on the past boundary is easily found since it consists of two parts , one corresponding to an exponential potential and one to a constant potential .",
    "it consists of fixed points and heteroclinic orbits ( orbits that originate and end at distinct fixed points ) that join them .",
    "since there are no heteroclinic cycles on the past boundary , it follows that all interior physical orbits originate from the fixed points , which are given by    [ fixedpoints ] @xmath128    where @xmath129 only exists on the extended physical state space if @xmath130 .",
    "this fixed point corresponds to the self - similar solution for an exponential potential , which yields a power - law solution , explaining the nomenclature . if @xmath131 this solution is accelerating since @xmath132 for @xmath129 .",

    "finally , @xmath98 stands for de sitter since @xmath119 for this fixed point , although note that this de sitter state corresponds to @xmath135 ; i.e. , it is an asymptotic state and not a physical de sitter solution with finite constant @xmath5 .",
    "a local analysis of the fixed points shows that if @xmath136 then both @xmath137 and @xmath138 are sources while @xmath129 is a saddle with a single solution entering the physical state space . if @xmath139 then @xmath138 is a source , while @xmath137 is a saddle from which no solutions enter the physical state space .",
    "arguably , the most interesting fixed point is @xmath98 , which is a center saddle , with a one - dimensional center manifold corresponding to the `` attractor solution '' or the `` inflationary trajectory '' . to describe this interior state space solution , which originates from @xmath98",

    "it is obvious that there exists an open set with initial data with such initial energies that do not have a quasi - de sitter phase in their evolution .",

    "the inflationary `` attractor '' solution , being a one - dimensional center manifold , attracts nearby solutions exponentially rapidly , which then move along the center manifold in a relatively slow power - law manner in the vicinity of the de sitter fixed point .",

    "nevertheless , although this holds for an open set of solutions that shadow the past boundary from fixed points that are sources to a de sitter state on this boundary , it should also be pointed out that there exists an open set of solutions that behave differently , as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : esolspace ] and  [ fig : tsolspace ] . ruling out these other solutions as physically irrelevant and explaining the special role of the `` inflationary attractor solution '' beyond its center manifold structure , thereby relies on paradigmatic assumptions relating the problem to broader contexts .",
    "examples of such contexts involve various proposed theoretical frameworks as well as , e.g. , scale considerations , illustrated in the discussion of e.g. ref .",
