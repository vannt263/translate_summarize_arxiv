    "two types of superconducting , incoherent detectors of millimeter and sub - millimeter radiation have undergone rapid development in the past decade : transition edge sensors and kinetic inductance detectors .",
    "tes arrays of 1000s of pixels with micromachined thermal isolation structures have been developed which approach background - limited sensitivity for both ground - based and space - based observations of faint sources such as the cmb .",
    "kid arrays with similar pixel counts have been deployed in instruments such as music , but they have not yet reached these same sensitivity levels .",
    "however , the simplicity of fabricating and multiplexing kids has sparked considerable interest and naturally invites comparison with tes arrays in terms of their ultimate sensitivity .",
    "for an optimized tes , the fundamental noise limits arise from two sources : photon noise from the astrophysical sources or backgrounds under observation , and thermal noise caused by fluctuations in thermal carriers ( typically phonons ) passing through the weak thermal isolation link from the bolometer s absorbing structure to the thermal bath . for kids , photon noise is also present , as is generation - recombination ( g - r ) noise , caused by fluctuations in the number density of quasiparticles in the device from optical or thermal excitations .",
    "it is similar to g - r noise in a photoconductor , caused by fluctuations in the number of charge carriers in a semiconductor .",
    "currently , kids are limited by other noise sources , such as two - level system noise in the dielectric substrates , but rapid progress is being made in understanding and reducing these noise contributions @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we compare the ` fundamental noise ' limits of kid and tes detectors , particularly as applied to observations of the cmb .",
    "we study their performance in both ground - based and space - based optical loading conditions and with bath temperatures below 250 mk , typical of the cryogenic systems used for cmb applications .",
    "we begin by describing the details of the dominant detector noise contributions for kids and tess , as well as our optimization scheme and our assumptions for each detector type",
    ". finally , we present our comparison results .",
    "the nep from recombination noise in a superconducting system is @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the superconducting energy gap .",
    "@xmath2 is the efficiency of converting energy into quasiparticles .",
    "@xmath3 is the number of quasiparticles , and @xmath4 is the time constant for quasiparticle decay into cooper pairs .",
    "the general behavior of @xmath2 is known from monte carlo simulations @xcite : the efficiency approaches 1 when the photon energy is matched to @xmath5 , and approaches 0.57 when the photon energy is much larger than @xmath5 . for our calculations ,",
    "we have used a simple model : @xmath6 when @xmath7 and @xmath8 when @xmath9 .",

    "the first term on the right side of the equation describes optical quasiparticle generation .",
    "the amount of energy per time that contributes to breaking cooper pairs is @xmath13 , and the amount of energy required to excite each quasiparticle is @xmath1 .",
    "the second term on the right side of the equation describes quasiparticle decay .",
    "the rate of quasiparticle decay is @xmath14 , and the number of quasiparticles decaying per time scales with the number of quasiparticles present , @xmath11 . in the steady - state , @xmath15 ,",
    "so @xmath16 simplifying , @xmath17 using this result in equation 1 gives the following for the optical recombination noise , independent of @xmath4 : @xmath18 which is consistent with the result obtained by zmuidzinas @xcite and others .",

    "@xmath4 can be calculated from @xmath23 , the material dependent characteristic quasiparticle recombination time , as follows @xcite : @xmath24",
    "[ [ optical - recombination - noise ] ] optical recombination noise : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    to calculate the optical recombination noise we begin with eqn . 3 from above with the approximation that for @xmath25 ,",
    "@xmath26 the energy gap also determines the pair - breaking efficiency , @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "[ [ thermal - recombination - noise ] ] thermal recombination noise : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    equations 5 and 6 can be used to calculate the thermal noise .",
    "we have calculated the thermal recombination noise for a lumped element titanium nitride ( tin ) kid designed to absorb millimeter radiation , with an absorber volume of @xmath27 ( for an inductive meander of length @xmath28 3.7 cm , width @xmath29 , and thickness 25 nm , covering an area of @xmath28 14 mm@xmath30 ) .",
    "nep dependance on volume is complicated but weak .",
    "results are qualitatively similar for an order of magnitude range of volumes ; for example , an order of magnitude decrease in volume shifts the local minimum and maximum in fig . 1 down in frequency by @xmath2810% .",
    "tin offers several advantages over other common superconducting films such as aluminum , including high internal quality factor , long characteristic quasiparticle recombination time , and tunable critical temperature . for tin ,",
    "we have used @xmath31 @xmath32 and @xmath33ns at 1 k @xcite and scales as @xmath34 , which are reasonable current estimates for these values @xcite .    in these calculations of optical and thermal noise , we restrict @xmath35 so that @xmath36  k and select the value of @xmath35 which gives the lowest total noise .",
    "we call this the  optimal @xmath35 .",
    "\" parameters dependent on @xmath35 , such as @xmath1 , @xmath4 , and @xmath2 , are adjusted accordingly as part of determining the optimal @xmath35 .",
    "the factor of 5 was chosen in order to be consistent with the approximation that @xmath37 , which is valid only when @xmath35 is well above the bath temperature .",
    "neglecting readout and johnson noise contributions , tes bolometer noise is fundamentally limited by the thermal fluctuation noise occurring across the bolometer thermal weak link . this noise scales with the temperature of the detector and the temperature - dependent thermal conductance of the weak link , @xmath38 , between the hot absorbing region of the bolometer ( @xmath39 ) and the cold bath ( @xmath40 ) . for @xmath41 , @xmath42 . however , for cmb optical loading , the tes bolometer experiences a relatively large heating due to the optical and bias loading power , and @xmath43 . in this case ,",
    "bolometer thermal noise includes an additional term accounting for the thermal gradient across the link as follows @xcite : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the index of thermal conductivity of the bolometer .",
    "here we have considered the case of diffuse conduction in the thermal link for the typical case of phonon - phonon scattering across a geometrically long weak link .",
    "finally , bolometer thermal conductance is defined as : @xmath46 @xmath47 is the total power , including optical power and bias power which flows across the bolometer thermal weak link , and @xmath48 is the temperature - independent thermal conductance coefficient .",
    "we begin by assuming an optical loading and a bias power , which determines @xmath49 as follows : @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the bias factor . for a chosen @xmath40 , the design requirement @xmath39 ( approximate @xmath35 )",
    "is then constrained by the choice of @xmath48 via equation 9 . for each of the loading and @xmath40 scenarios which follow ,",
    "we choose @xmath48 to optimize nep .",
    "we have chosen to use a thermal conductivity index of @xmath52 , characteristic of a thermal weak link controlled by phonon - phonon scattering , which is the most common tes bolometer design .",
    "we use a bias factor greater than 1 , which is typical to ensure the tes will not be saturated if the optical loading is higher than expected @xcite .",
    "we begin with the usual expression for photon noise , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the center frequency , @xmath55 is the photon occupation number per mode , and @xmath56 is the efficiency from emission to detection of one mode .",
    "our results assume optical loading with 30% bandwidth and optical efficiency of 40% .",
    "the optical power is @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the optical efficiency , and @xmath59 is the fractional bandwidth . in the space - based scenario , a 2.7 k sky temperature with emissivity of 100% is used . in the ground - based scenario , a 250 k sky temperature with 4% emissivity ( 10 k rayleigh - jeans equivalent ) is used .",
    "the total noise is simply each noise source , added in quadrature : for kids , @xmath60 . for tess , @xmath61",
    "first we consider how the nep varies with optical frequency for tess and kids .",
    "figure 1 shows the ratio of the total nep to the photon nep as a function of optical frequency with a bath temperature of 100 mk for ground- and space- based scenarios . under these conditions , across the range of frequencies considered , the kid has slightly higher noise than the tes with a bias factor of 2 . at 100 ghz ,",
    "the kid pays a 10% penalty in noise compared to the bias factor 2 tes in the ground - based case and a 11% penalty in the space - based case .",
    "second , we consider how the nep varies with bath temperature .",
    "figure 2 shows the total nep versus bath temperature with an optical frequency of 100 ghz .",
    "again , the kid has slightly higher noise under these conditions for the range of bath temperatures considered here .    while kids have slightly higher noise in all of these cases , it is important to consider that kids can enjoy significant advantages over tess in fabrication simplicity , multiplexing , focal plane coverage , and tolerance of @xmath35 variation , depending on design .",
    "ultimately , we believe that kids are a competitive technology , especially for high pixel - count arrays ."
