    "understanding the interaction of coupled individual systems continues to receive interest in the engineering research community @xcite . recently , more attention has been paid to cluster synchronization problems which have much wide applications , such as segregation into small subgroups for a robotic team @xcite or physical particles @xcite , predicting opinion dynamics in social networks @xcite , and cluster phase synchronization of coupled oscillators @xcite .    in the models reported in most of the literature ,",
    "the clustering pattern is predefined and fixed ; research focuses are on deriving conditions that can enforce cluster synchronization for various system models .",
    "preliminary studies in @xcite reported algebraic conditions on the interaction graph for coupled agents with simple integrator dynamics . subsequently , a cluster - spanning tree condition is used to achieve intra - cluster synchronization for first - order integrators ( discrete time or continuous time ) , while inter - cluster separations are realized by using nonidentical feed - forward input terms . for more complicated system models , e.g. , nonlinear systems ( ) and generic linear systems ( ) , both control designs and inter - agent coupling conditions",
    "are responsible for the occurrence of cluster synchronization . for coupled nonlinear systems , e.g. , chaotic oscillators ,",
    "algebraic and graph topological clustering conditions are derived for either identical models ( ) or nonidentical models ( ) under the key assumption that the input matrix of all systems is identical and it can stabilize the system dynamics of all individual agents via linear state feedback ( i.e. , the so - called quad condition ) . for identical generic linear systems which are partial - state coupled , a stabilizing control gain matrix solved from a ricatti inequality is utilized by all agents , and agents are pinned with some additional agents so that the interaction subgraph of each cluster contains a directed spanning tree .",
    "the system models introduced above can describe a rich class of applications for multi - agent systems .",
    "a common characteristic is that the uncoupled system dynamics of all the agents can be stabilized by linear state feedback attenuated by a unique matrix ( i.e. , static state feedback ) .",
    "this simplification allows the derivation of coupling conditions to be independent of the control design of any agent , and thus offers scalability to a static coupling strategy .",
    "this kind of benefit still exists for nonidentical nonlinear systems which are full - state coupled , as all the system dynamics can be constrained by a common lipchitz constant ( lipchitz can imply the quad condition @xcite ) .",
    "however , for the class of partial - state coupled nonidentical linear systems , the stabilizing matrices for distinct linear system models are usually different .",
    "then the coupling conditions under static couplings will be correlated with the control designs of all individual systems .",
    "this correlation not only harms the scalability of a coupling strategy but also increases the difficulty in specifying a graph topological condition on the interaction graph .",
    "the goal of this paper is to achieve state cluster synchronization for partial - state coupled nonidentical linear systems , where agents with the same uncoupled dynamics are supposed to synchronize together .",
    "this is a problem of practical interest , for instance , maintaining different formation clusters for different types of interconnected vehicles , providing different synchronization frequencies for different groups of clocks using coupled nonidentical harmonic oscillators , reaching different consensus values for people with different opinion dynamics , and so on . in order to relieve the difficulties in using the conventional",
    "couplings , couplings with a _ dynamic _ structure is proposed by introducing a vanishing auxiliary variable which facilitates interactions among agents . with the proposed dynamic couplings , an algebraic necessary and sufficient condition , which is independent of the control design ,",
    "is derived .",
    "this newly derived algebraic condition subsumes those published for integrator systems in @xcite as special cases . due to the entanglement between nonidentical system matrices and the parameters from the interaction graph , the algebraic condition is not straightforward to check .",
    "thus , a graph topological interpretation of the algebraic condition is provided under the assumption that the interaction subgraph associated with each cluster contain a directed spanning tree .",
    "we also derive lower bounds for the local coupling strengths in different clusters , which are independent of the control design due to the dynamic coupling structure .",
    "this spanning tree condition is further shown to be a necessary condition when the clusters and the inter - cluster links form an acyclic structure .",
    "this conclusion reveals the indispensability of direct links among agents belonging to the same cluster , and further strengthens the sufficiency statement presented initially in .",
    "another contribution of the proposed dynamic couplings in comparison to those static couplings in is that the lower bound of a global factor which weights the whole interaction graph is also independent of the control design . for this reason ,",
    "the least exponential convergence rate of cluster synchronization is characterized more explicitly than that in .",
    "the derived results in this paper are illustrated by simulation examples for two applications : cluster heading alignment of nonidentical ships and cluster phase synchronization of nonidentical harmonic oscillators .",
