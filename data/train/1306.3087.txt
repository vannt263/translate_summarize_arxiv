    "partially commutative groups are a class of groups widely studied on account of their simple definition , their intrinsically rich structure and their natural appearance in several branches of computer science and mathematics .",
    "crucial examples , which shape the theory of presentations of groups , arise from study of their subgroups : notably bestvina and brady s example of a group which is homologically finite ( of type @xmath2 ) but not geometrically finite ( in fact not of type @xmath3 ) ; and mihailova s example of a group with unsolvable subgroup membership problem .",
    "more recently results of wise and others have lead to agol s proof of the virtual haken conjecture : that every hyperbolic haken @xmath4-manifold is virtually fibred .",
    "an essential step in the argument uses the result that the fundamental groups of so - called `` special '' cube complexes embed into partially commutative groups .",
    "( it turns out that the manifolds in question have finite covers which are special . ) in the light of such results it is natural to ask which groups arise as subgroups of partially commutative groups , and , in particular , when one partially commutative group embeds in another .    let @xmath5 be a finite ( undirected ) simple graph , with vertex set @xmath6 and edge set @xmath7 , and let @xmath8 be the free group on @xmath6",

    "the partially commutative group @xmath15 is said to have _ non - commutation graph _ @xmath17 .",
    "note that the graph @xmath5 uniquely determines the partially commutative group up to isomorphism ; that is two pc groups @xmath15 and @xmath20 are isomorphic if and only if @xmath5 is isomorphic to @xmath21 , see @xcite .",
    "since isomorphism of pc groups can be characterised in terms of their defining graphs is natural to ask for an analogous characterisation of embedding between pc groups .",

    "in fact droms proved @xcite that every subgroup of a partially commutative group @xmath15 is partially commutative if and only if @xmath5 is both @xmath0 and @xmath1 free , where @xmath27 is the cycle graph on @xmath28 vertices and @xmath29 is the path graph with @xmath28 edges .",

    "more precisely , we generalise one direction of droms theorem to prove that if @xmath23 is both @xmath0 and @xmath1 free , then the extension graph conjecture holds for @xmath26 .",
    "however , in section [ sec : egc ] below we give a counterexample to the extension graph conjecture .",
    "we note that droms also showed that a pc group is coherent if and only if it is chordal @xcite , i.e. @xmath27-free , for all @xmath40 .",
    "our example in section [ sec : egc ] , shows that there are chordal graphs , and so coherent pc groups , for which the extension graph conjecture fails .    as mentioned above",
    ", one reason that so much attention has been given to pc groups is that several classes of important groups embed into them .",
    "for example , motivated by 3-manifold theory , there has been a body of research investigating which partially commutative groups contain closed hyperbolic surfaces as subgroups ( that is , fundamental groups of closed surfaces of euler characteristic less than @xmath41 ; see @xcite and the references there ) . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that many orientable surface groups embed into pc groups and subsequently crisp and wiest @xcite showed that the fundamental group of every compact surface embeds into some pc group , except in the cases of the compact , closed , non - orientable , surfaces of euler characteristic @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which do not embed in any pc group . as observed in @xcite , every orientable surface group in fact embeds in @xmath44 . in section [ sec : wcc ] we establish similar results for the complement @xmath45 of @xmath46 , in place of @xmath47 .",
    "although being an induced subgraph is not a necessary condition for embeddability , for some particular induced subgraphs it is a useful criterion .",
    "for instance , a pc group @xmath15 contains @xmath48 ( resp .",
    "@xmath0 ) , if and only if @xmath1 ( resp .",
    "@xmath0 ) is an induced subgraph of @xmath5 , see @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors ask if the presence of an induced @xmath28-cycle , @xmath49 , in the defining graph @xmath5 is a necessary condition for the group @xmath15 to contain a hyperbolic surface group .",
    "however , counterexamples were given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for example , the fundamental group of the closed , compact , orientable surface of genus @xmath50 embeds in the pc group @xmath51 , although @xmath52 has no induced @xmath28-cycle , for @xmath49 .",
    "note however that in the case when the graph @xmath5 is triangle - free , @xmath53 for some @xmath54 if and only if @xmath55 for some @xmath56 , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 48 ) .    in spite of these examples ,",
    "the question raised by gordon , long and reid survives in the following form .",
    "[ quest : surface ] is there a partially commutative group @xmath15 that contains the fundamental group of a closed hyperbolic surface but contains no subgroup isomorphic to @xmath57 , for @xmath49 ?    in this weaker form , the question is still open and emphasises the importance of resolving question [ quest1 ] in the particular case when @xmath21 is a @xmath28-cycle , @xmath49 .",
    "one approach to question 2 is to prove that certain classes of graphs give rise to pc groups containing no subgroups @xmath57 , @xmath49 .",
    "a possible candidate is the class of weakly chordal graphs : a graph @xmath5 is called _ weakly chordal _ if @xmath5 does not contain an induced @xmath27 or @xmath58 for @xmath59 , where @xmath58 denotes the complement of @xmath27 .",
