    "de sitter or quasi - de sitter spacetimes describe the inflationary epoch of the universe at its early stages , and also the present universe which has entered the period of accelerated expansion .",
    "one of the most intriguing issues today is to realize such de sitter vacua in fundamental high - energy physics .",
    "particularly , higher - dimensional spacetimes are required by string theory , which is a promising candidate for the fundamental theory . in order to obtain the effective four - dimensional theory in higher - dimensional spacetime we should usually compactify the extra dimensions and stabilize the compactified internal space .",
    "thus we need to embed a four - dimensional de sitter spacetime into higher - dimensional spacetimes together with stabilization of the extra dimensions .    the freund ",
    "rubin compactification  @xcite is a simple model with a stabilization mechanism that the extra dimensions are dynamically compactified and stabilized by a flux of anti - symmetric tensor field or form field . in this model with @xmath0-dimensional spacetime , a @xmath1-form flux field is introduced to stabilize the @xmath1-dimensional compact space .",
    "moreover , turning on a positive bulk cosmological constant allows an external de sitter space and an internal manifold with positive curvature  @xcite ( also , adding a dilaton field  @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , we obtain a @xmath0-dimensional product spacetime which consists of a @xmath2-dimensional de sitter space @xmath3 and a @xmath1-dimensional sphere @xmath4 , that is the freund ",
    "rubin ( fr ) solution .",
    "it has been known that the freund ",
    "rubin solution has two classes of dynamical instabilities  @xcite ; one is attributed to homogeneous excitation ( @xmath5 mode ) of the internal space , corresponding to change of the radius of the extra dimensions ; and the other is inhomogeneous excitation with quadrupole moment ( @xmath6 mode ) and higher multi - pole moments ( @xmath7 modes ) , representing deformation of the extra dimensions .",
    "the @xmath5 mode is the so - called volume modulus or radion , and becomes tachyonic when the hubble expansion rate of the external de sitter space is too large ( in other words , when the flux density on the internal space is small ) .",
    "this fact implies that if the energy scale of the inflationary external spacetime is sufficiently larger than the compactification scale of the internal space , the volume modulus will be destabilized . in order to avoid the emergence of this instability , configurations with small hubble expansion rate",
    "is preferable .    while instability of the volume modulus exists already in @xmath8 ,",
    "instabilities arising from deformation of extra dimensions emerge only if the number of extra dimensions is larger than or equal to four . in the unstable region ,",
    "in which at least one of the @xmath9 modes are tachyonic , the external spacetime has small hubble expansion rate including the minkowski spacetime .",
    "it means that the flux densities are very large in the unstable region of this type .",
    "it should be noted that for more than four extra dimensions , the two unstable regions overlap so that stable configurations for the fr solution no longer exist .",
    "little has been known about the non - perturbative properties of the instability from higher multi - pole modes ; mode was studied in  @xcite . ]",
    "how it turns out after the onset of this instability and whether any stable configuration exists as a possible end - state in this model , and so on . in the previous work  @xcite",
    ", one of us has shown that in the freund ",
    "rubin compactification there is a new branch of solutions other than the fr solutions .",
    "those solutions are described as the warped product of an external de sitter space and an internal deformed sphere .",
    "it has been found that the branch of the fr solutions and that of the warped solutions intersect at the point where the fr solution becomes marginally stable for the @xmath6 mode .",
    "although we have seen existence of non - trivial solutions other than the fr solutions , their stability remains unanswered .    in this paper",
    "we are particularly concerned with the close connection between dynamical stability and thermodynamic stability .",
    "the interesting relationship between dynamical and thermodynamic stability , which is well known as the correlated stability conjecture ( or the gubser ",
    "mitra conjecture  @xcite ) , has been suggested and confirmed for some black objects ( strings , branes and so on ) by many authors  @xcite .",
    "( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein . )",
    "it is important to examine whether such connections really exist and whether they can be extended to systems other than black objects such as spacetimes with de sitter horizons .",
    "in fact , for the fr solutions we can simply reinterpret the instability from the @xmath5 mode based on thermodynamic arguments  @xcite as follows ( and also see @xcite ) . for a fixed total flux on the internal space , the branch of fr solutions are divided into two sub - branches in terms of entropy defined by the total area of the de sitter horizon : a sub - branch of solutions with higher entropy and the other with lower entropy .",
    "both sub - branches terminate at one critical point , where the @xmath5 mode becomes massless and the fr solution is marginally stable .",
    "moreover , the solutions on the lower - entropy sub - branch , which are thermodynamically unfavorable , are dynamically unstable since the @xmath5 mode is tachyonic .",
    "thus thermodynamic instability exactly coincides with dynamical instability for the @xmath5 mode of two sub - branches within the fr branch .",
    "the aim of this paper is to examine the stability of the new branch of warped solutions from both dynamical and thermodynamic perspectives .",
    "this opens up new possibilities of the applicability of close connection between dynamical and thermodynamic stabilities .",
    "we examine the dynamical stability by analyzing perturbative stability of the system in a straightforward way . for simplicity ,",
    "we restrict our considerations to the sector which behaves as scalar with respect to the external de sitter space since unstable perturbations of the fr solutions are in this sector .    in the case of four - dimensional external spacetime and four - dimensional internal space",
    ", we numerically obtain the kaluza ",
    "klein ( kk ) mass spectrum and show that the warped solutions are stable in the low hubble regime , while the fr solutions are unstable due to the @xmath6 mode in the same regime within numerical accuracy .    in order to reveal the thermodynamic property we derive the first law of de sitter thermodynamics for freund  rubin compactifications .",
    "each branch of the fr solutions and the warped solutions obeys the first law in terms of entropy @xmath10 and total flux @xmath11 : @xmath12 where two parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 characterize the flux density on the internal space and the hubble expansion rate of the external de sitter space , respectively .",
    "this fact means that for a fixed total flux , the branch with higher entropy should be thermodynamically favored .",
    "comparison between the entropy of the fr branch and that of the warped branch for a given total flux tells us which branch is thermodynamically favored .",
    "the result is that the warped branch is entropically favored in the low hubble regime while the fr branch is favored in the high hubble regime .    the above results are briefly summarized as follows :    * for small hubble expansion rate , the warped branch is thermodynamically favored and dynamically stable . * for large hubble expansion rate , the fr branch",
    "is thermodynamically favored and dynamically stable .",
    "thus , as we have expected , we see complete agreement of thermodynamic and dynamical stabilities for two branches of fr compactifications .",
    "this provides yet another example showing close connections between thermodynamic an dynamical properties of systems with horizons .",

    "hence the entropy @xmath10 is a thermodynamic potential with respect to the total flux @xmath11 as a natural thermodynamic variable .",
    "we shall call a sequence of solutions which satisfies the first law a `` branch '' of solutions .",

    "therefore , the second law of thermodynamics states that , for a fixed value of the total flux , a configuration with larger entropy is thermodynamically favored .    to begin with ,",

    "nonetheless , the fr solutions can be described as an one - parameter family of solutions , for example , in terms of the hubble expansion rate @xmath14 of the external de sitter space . actually , the entropy is a single - valued function of @xmath14 .",
    "these facts mean that a map from @xmath11 to @xmath14 becomes singular at the critical value .",

    "we have seen that the unwarped branch is dynamically stable for @xmath14 larger than a critical value @xmath160 but unstable for smaller values . on the other hand ,",
    "the warped branch is dynamically unstable for @xmath161 and stable for @xmath162 . to investigate thermodynamic perspective",
    ", we have defined the total de sitter entropy @xmath10 as the @xmath159-dimensional de sitter entropy integrated over extra dimensions .",
    "we have shown that the dynamically stable branch , i.e. the unwarped ( or warped ) branch for @xmath161 ( or @xmath162 , respectively ) , always has larger total de sitter entropy than the dynamically unstable branch .",
    "therefore , thermodynamic stability agrees with dynamical stability .    in this section",
    "we consider cosmological implications of these results . for this purpose",
    "we shall first define the @xmath159-dimensional einstein frame .",

    "it is convenient to define the @xmath159-dimensional einstein frame @xmath170 by @xmath171 in terms of which @xmath172 now includes the @xmath159-dimensional einstein - hilbert term : @xmath173    + \\cdots.\\ ] ]    suppose that the @xmath159-dimensional metric @xmath43 represents a de sitter spacetime with the hubble expansion rate @xmath14 .",
    "the corresponding einstein frame metric @xmath170 has the hubble expansion rate @xmath174 and the de sitter entropy @xmath175 actually , this agrees with the total de sitter entropy ( [ eq : entropy ] ) : @xmath176    for cosmological considerations energy density is more convenient than de sitter entropy since the former can easily be extended to a general frw universe .",
    "the effective energy density in the einstein frame is @xmath177 this is related to the total de sitter entropy as @xmath178    therefore , the results of previous sections are restated in terms of the effective energy density @xmath179 in the einstein frame as follows : dynamically stable branch , i.e. the unwarped ( warped ) branch for @xmath161 ( @xmath162 ) , always has lower @xmath179 than the dynamically unstable branch .",
    "this strongly suggests that a solution in the dynamically unstable branch should evolve to a solution in the dynamically stable branch .",
    "the latter solution is uniquely specified by the former since the flux @xmath11 conserves . by this evolution",
    ", @xmath179 decreases .    moreover , the results of the previous sections suggest a new type of phase transition .",
    "suppose that @xmath17 is not the genuine constant but has a contribution from dynamical fields such as a scalar field . in this case",
    "@xmath17 is expected to decrease while the flux @xmath11 stays constant .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : drho_lambda ] . )",
    "if we start with @xmath161 then the unwarped branch has lower energy density and is stable .",
    "thus a solution in the unwarped branch should be realized initially .",
    "however , as @xmath17 decreases , @xmath14 also decreases and can reach the critical value @xmath160 . at that point ,",
    "the stable and unstable branches merge .",
    "after that , for @xmath162 , solutions in the warped branch should be realized since this branch has lower energy density and is stable .",
    "this phase transition should be second - order since only one of the two branches is stable at a given time .",
    "second - order phase transitions play important roles in cosmology .",
    "for example , the end of hybrid inflation is due to second - order phase transition .",
    "thus , this kind of phase transition may provide a new way of realizing hybrid inflation in higher - dimensional theories .",
    "this possibility will be investigated in future publications .",
    "in this paper we have investigated stability of two branches of freund  rubin compactification from two perspectives ; one is thermodynamic stability based on de sitter entropy , and the other is dynamical stability of linear perturbations around the background solutions .",
    "we have analyzed linear perturbations around the warped solutions in order to examine dynamical stability of the solutions .",
    "the warped solutions are stable if the hubble expansion rate of the external de sitter spacetime is low enough . in the same regime of the hubble expansion rate , the freund ",
    "rubin solutions have instability arising from the @xmath6 mode .",
    "it follows from what has been said thus far that deformation of the internal space and warping will stabilize unstable configurations .",
    "this may be considered as spontaneous breaking of the symmetry of internal space in the sense that less symmetric configurations are dynamically chosen .",
    "actually , for the reason explained below , this phenomenon is natural from gravitational viewpoints .",
    "in cosmology it is well known that configurations with high matter density suffer from gravitational instability due to long - wavelength modes , namely jeans instability .",
    "jeans instability develops inhomogeneities in the universe and results in structure formation . in the case of fr compactification",
    ", einstein equation tells that the external space with small hubble expansion rate corresponds to the internal space with large flux density .",
    "therefore , it is natural to expect that when the hubble expansion rate is low enough , the flux distribution may become inhomogeneous due to analogue of the jeans instability .    in order to analyze thermodynamic properties ,",
    "we have first derived the first law of de sitter thermodynamics in terms of entropy and total flux .",
    "sequence of solutions belonging to a branch obey this first law when those parameters characterizing the solutions change .",
    "since the entropy is a natural thermodynamic potential for the total flux , for a given total flux , configuration with higher entropy should be favored thermodynamically . for @xmath37 and @xmath38",
    "we have compared the entropy of the fr branch with that of the warped branch .",
    "there is a critical value of the hubble expansion rate at which two branches merge and it is thus obvious that the entropies of the two branches agree at the critical value . for smaller hubble expansion rate ,",
    "the entropy of the warped branch is larger than that of the fr branch and thus the warped branch is thermodynamically favored . on the other hand , for larger hubble expansion rate",
    ", the fr branch is thermodynamically favored .",
    "we found complete agreement of thermodynamic stability and dynamical stability .",
    "it is intriguing to see that correlation between thermodynamic stability and dynamical stability exists for freund  rubin flux compactification . for a certain class of black objects",
    "the existence of such correlation has been known , that is the so - called gubser ",
    "mitra conjecture .",
    "this conjecture has been explicitly checked to hold for various black strings and branes . from what has been discussed above , it is probably natural to expect that the concept of correlated stability can be extended to a wider class of gravitating systems",
