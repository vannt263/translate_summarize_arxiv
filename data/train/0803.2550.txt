    "chiral symmetry is one of the guiding principles for studying hadron physics based on the underlying theory of qcd .",
    "the chiral perturbation theory  @xcite enables us to study low - energy hadron dynamics systematically . by construction , however , perturbative calculations can not be applied to the system with bound states and/or resonances .",
    "for instance , the leading order term of the chiral perturbation theory describes well the @xmath2 scattering lengths  @xcite , while it can not reproduce either the @xmath2 scattering amplitude around the @xmath3 resonance energy or the @xmath4 scattering length due to the presence of the @xmath0 resonance below the threshold . to describe the latter system in the chiral effective theory ,",
    "the resonances can be either introduced as elementary fields in the lagrangian or generated dynamically in hadron scattering . in general , they can also mix .",
    "the clarification of these dynamics is one of issues that we discuss in this paper .",
    "recent developments in the study of resonance scattering based on chiral dynamics have been made ; the implementation of the unitarity condition on the scattering amplitude leads to the nonperturbative resummation of the @xmath5-channel diagrams , generating the resonance pole in the amplitude dynamically .",
    "this chiral unitary approach was successfully applied to the scattering of the pseudoscalar meson with octet baryons  @xcite , with pseudoscalar mesons  @xcite , with decuplet baryons  @xcite , with vector mesons  @xcite , and with heavy flavored hadrons  @xcite , thanks to the dominant contribution from the model - independent low - energy interaction  @xcite .",
    "these studies reproduce many scattering observables as well as the properties of the observed resonances .    despite the remarkable success of the chiral unitary approach ,",
    "the origin of the resonances is not well understood , especially for the baryonic sector .",
    "one simply expects that the resonances found in this approach are quasibound states of a meson and a baryon generated by their two - body interaction .",
    "hereafter we call this by the meson - baryon picture of the resonance",
    ". this picture may be in contrast to the description of resonances as genuine quark states .",
    "such a state is generally called the castillejo - dalitz - dyson ( cdd ) pole  @xcite , which is not generated in the dynamics of the meson - baryon scattering , but has some different origins .",
    "the importance of the cdd pole in the chiral unitary approach was first pointed out and discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in most cases ,",
    "the cdd pole is introduced explicitly as an elementary field in the chiral perturbation theory  @xcite or in the unitarized framework  @xcite .",
    "there are , however , some cases in which the cdd pole contribution is hidden in the model parameters .",
    "for instance , in @xmath6 scattering , it has been argued that the pole for the @xmath7 meson is attributed to contact terms in the higher order lagrangian  @xcite , which is known to behave as a contracted resonance propagator in the chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "hence , the nature of the @xmath7 meson is considered to be of the cdd pole , presumably originated from the quark dynamics .",
    "this observation is in accordance with the study of the large @xmath8 limit and the @xmath8 scaling , where the pole of the @xmath7 meson behaves as a @xmath9 resonance rather than a two - meson quasibound state  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is also possible to have both cdd pole and dynamical state in one system  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the two components will be mixed in physical states .",
    "an example of the mixed situation has been studied in ref .",
    "there they studied the coupling property of the introduced field , which turned out to be similar to the corresponding physical resonance in full amplitude .",
    "in general , such a comparison of the couplings is useful in studying the origin of the resonance .    in this paper , we study the origin of the resonances in chiral dynamics , paying attention to the renormalization procedure . in the chiral unitary approach , we need to introduce renormalization parameters ( subtraction constants ) in order to tame the divergence in loop integrals , which have been used to fit experimental data  @xcite . here",
    "we propose a different strategy : determining the subtraction constant first to study the structure of the resonances .",
    "namely , we investigate whether the baryonic resonances obtained in the chiral unitary approach are purely dynamically generated resonances by meson - baryon scatterings or they have some components other than the dynamical one . for this purpose , we develop a renormalization scheme based on purely a theoretical argument to exclude the cdd pole contribution in the loop function .",
    "we introduce the following two requirements : ( 1 ) the scattering equation shares a common feature with ordinary quantum mechanical problems based on the schrdinger equation , and ( 2 ) the obtained scattering amplitude is consistent with the low - energy interaction at a certain kinematic point . with these conditions ,",
    "we determine the value of the subtraction constant uniquely for the single - channel scattering system without cdd poles .",
    "we call this scheme `` natural renormalization , '' which specifies a standard value of the subtraction constant . having this scheme",
    ", we will discuss the meaning of the subtraction constant , which is different from the standard value , in what follows .",
    "next we consider the scattering amplitude in comparison with experimental data , and propose a method to extract the low - energy structure of the amplitude in the natural renormalization scheme . from the viewpoint of renormalization",
    ", we first note that the change of the subtraction constant can be absorbed into the change of the interaction kernel , once the experimental input is given .",
    "if the resonance is dominated by the meson - baryon component , experimental data are well reproduced in the natural renormalization scheme with the interaction kernel without the cdd pole contribution .",
    "if the experimental amplitude requires a large contribution from the cdd pole , one has to introduce its effect either in the subtraction constant or in the kernel interaction . in one way",
    ", we can reproduce experimental data by suitably choosing the subtraction constant , but keeping the interaction kernel unchanged .",
    "we find that this phenomenological amplitude can be equivalently expressed by the natural value of the subtraction constant and the interaction with explicit contribution of the cdd pole . in this way",
    ", the origin of the resonances can be studied , making use of the natural renormalization scheme and the experimental input .",

    ", it was shown that the off - shell effects can be absorbed into the renormalization of the kernel interaction  @xcite , leading to the algebraic solution given in eq .  , which includes the resummation of the @xmath5-channel bubble diagrams .",

    "with respect to @xmath42 : @xmath43 which is negative for @xmath44 .",
    "the physical @xmath5-channel scattering takes place above the threshold @xmath45 , which is on the unitarity ( right hand ) cut .",
    "the energy region below the threshold @xmath41 corresponds to the bound state region of the @xmath5-channel scattering . in the present formulation of the @xmath10 method , we fully take into account the unitarity cut , while the contribution from the unphysical ( left hand ) cut",
    "is included through order - by - order matching .",

    "the dimensional regularization is compatible with the analyticity of the amplitude , which is suitable for the @xmath10 method based on dispersion theory .",
    "we will make use of both renormalization schemes for the loop function in the following sections .",
    "in this section , we propose the `` natural renormalization scheme , '' which provides a suitable description for meson - baryon scattering without the cdd pole contribution . our strategy is to determine theoretically the subtraction constant of the loop function in order to study the structure of the resonances .",
    "this is in contrast to the previous studies in which the subtraction constant is fitted to data . to determine the value of the subtraction constant theoretically , throughout this section",
    ", we assume that there is no contribution to the intermediate states in the loop function from the cdd pole and the amplitude follows the low - energy structure required by chiral symmetry . for illustration ,",
    "the interaction kernel @xmath20 is chosen to be the wt term @xmath48 given in eq .  , which does not contain the cdd pole contribution .",
    "we may also consider higher order terms , such as quark mass terms . in this case , however , some of the higher order terms are known to contain resonance contributions . for the loop integral ,",
    "we first show that the subtraction constant has an upper limit for the consistency with the physical interpretation of the loop function , which is inferred by familiar quantum mechanical problems .",
    "next we consider the matching of the unitarized amplitude with the low - energy interaction , and we derive the allowed region of the subtraction constant . combining these two conditions ,",
    "we determine the natural subtraction constant for the dynamical generation of resonances in a way consistent with low - energy chiral dynamics .",
    "note that this natural renormalization scheme is not aimed to describe an arbitrary meson - baryon scattering , but it assumes the absence of the cdd pole contribution in the loop function , as we discuss in detail below .",
    "let us first consider the sign of the loop function   below the threshold @xmath41 where the imaginary part vanishes . in the meson - baryon picture",
    ", we can assume that there are no states below the threshold contributing to the loop function as intermediate states .",
    "this sets up the model space of solving the scattering equation . in this case",
    ", the loop function should be negative below the threshold .",
    "this is essentially the same as what happens in the perturbative calculations of the energy of the lowest state which couples to higher states in a quantum mechanical system , where the energy correction becomes always negative .",
    "this condition is automatically satisfied in the cutoff regularization ; if we introduce a three - momentum cutoff @xmath49 , the loop function can be written as @xmath50 with @xmath51 this is always negative for @xmath52 , irrespective of the cutoff momentum @xmath53 .    in the dimensional regularization ,",
    "however , the real part can become positive if one takes a large positive value for the subtraction constant @xmath34 in eq .  .",
    "this can be avoided by introducing an upper limit for the subtraction constant . as we discussed in the previous section",
    ", our amplitude can be in principle extrapolated down to @xmath54 . since the loop function below the threshold is a decreasing function as seen in eq .",
    ", to make the loop function negative for the relevant energy region @xmath55 , it is sufficient for @xmath27 to have the negative value at @xmath54 , that is , @xmath56 which is equivalent to @xmath57\\bigr\\ } .",
    "\\label{eq : max1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if the subtraction constant satisfies this condition , the loop function with dimensional regularization is consistent with the physical requirement in the region of the @xmath5-channel scattering ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "next we require the amplitude @xmath15 to follow the chiral low - energy theorem  @xcite . as a result of the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking",
    ", the scattering amplitude @xmath36 can be expanded in powers of momenta of the pseudoscalar meson at low energy .",
    "since we choose @xmath48 for the interaction kernel as the leading order term of the chiral perturbation theory , the consistency of the low - energy theorem can be achieved by matching the full scattering amplitude @xmath15 with the kernel interaction @xmath48 at a certain scale @xmath59 : @xmath60 which is realized when @xmath61 as easily seen in eq .  .",
    "since the subtraction constant is a real number , eq .   should be satisfied below the threshold @xmath62 , otherwise the loop function has an imaginary part . on the other hand",
    ", the matching scale should not be far below the threshold , since the @xmath46-channel cut lies in the region @xmath63 , and the effect of the crossing dynamics becomes important at lower energies .",
    "therefore , here we set the lower limit of the matching scale at @xmath64 , to satisfy eq .   within the @xmath5-channel scattering region .",
    "in summary , we impose the matching scale to lie in the region @xmath65 which corresponds to choosing the subtraction constant as @xmath66 with @xmath67 the matching condition of eq .   was discussed for @xmath2 scattering in ref .",
    "it is reasonable to set the matching scale @xmath68 in this region when respecting the low - energy expansion .",
    "we note that for on - shell kinematics , the three - momentum is zero ( @xmath69 ) at @xmath70 , while it takes an imaginary value for the vanishing energy of the nambu - goldstone boson ( @xmath71 ) where @xmath72 .",
    "since the chiral perturbation theory is valid for small four - momentum @xmath73 , the matching scale @xmath68 should lie around the region  . in the chiral limit @xmath74",
    ", the range   reduces into one value @xmath64 , where @xmath75 .",
    "one may consider the correction to eq .   from the higher order",
    "interaction terms , such as the explicit symmetry breaking ( quark masses ) terms .",
    "once again , our aim is to determine the property of the loop function by excluding the cdd pole from it .",
    "therefore , in this case we can match the amplitude to the interaction @xmath76 including the higher order corrections by the same condition @xmath77 .",
    "the inclusion of the higher order terms in the interaction does not change the values of the subtraction constant in eq .  .",
    "in this case , however , we should note the possibility of having the cdd pole contribution in the interaction kernel @xmath76 from the higher order chiral lagrangian .",
    "based on the physical meaning of the loop function and matching with the chiral amplitude at low energy , we have derived two conditions for the subtraction constant , eqs .   and , which read @xmath78 with @xmath79 .",
    "this means that the subtraction constant @xmath80 which satisfies both conditions is uniquely fixed by @xmath81 in terms of the zero of the loop function , this condition is equivalent to requiring @xmath82 this subtraction constant is compatible with the absence of the cdd pole in the loop function , as we will discuss below",
    ". it also guarantees the matching of the scattering amplitude with the chiral low - energy interaction .",
    "we note once again that the subtraction constant so obtained does not necessarily explain experimental data .",
    "we have just specified a standard value of the subtraction constant .",
    "the relation to the phenomenologically determined value will be discussed in the next section .    in this renormalization condition",
    ", we exclude any states below the threshold as a model space of the unitarization , so that the unitarized amplitude in eq .",
    "naturally implements the meson - baryon picture in the model - building . therefore , with the value of @xmath80 , the loop function does not include the cdd pole contribution .",
    "the condition   was already proposed in a different context in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the matching with the @xmath46-channel scattering amplitude was emphasized . a similar argument with the present context based on chiral symmetry",
    "was given in refs .",
    "our point is to regard this condition as the exclusion of the cdd pole in the loop function , based on the consistency with the negativeness of the loop function . for illustration ,",

    "the @xmath5-channel scattering region is defined as @xmath87.,width=302 ]    let us make some remarks on related works .",
    "first , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a `` natural '' value for the subtraction constant was estimated to be @xmath88 , by comparing the loop function of dimensional regularization with that of three - momentum cutoff of @xmath89630 mev .",
    "this is different from our value of @xmath80 , practically and conceptually . in the present context",
    ", the value   is derived for the loop function as unaffected by cdd poles .",
    "we used the expression of the three - momentum cutoff to illustrate that the real part of the loop function is negative below threshold .",
    "it is not needed to introduce the explicit scale ( such as @xmath89630 mev ) of the cutoff in our case .",
    "the `` natural '' value in ref .",
    "@xcite can , in principle , be applied to any system , as long as the typical cutoff scale of the physics is around @xmath89630 mev . on the other hand ,",
    "our natural renormalization scheme is introduced just for excluding the cdd poles ; it does not describe the scattering with cdd poles .",
    "this possibility is considered in the next section .",
    "second , we introduce the condition of matching   to determine the value of the subtraction constant explicitly , along the same line with ref .",
    "this is different from the order - by - order matching introduced in ref .",
    "the latter is a conceptual matching used to derive the form of the interaction kernel @xmath76 .",
    "our condition   explicitly require the vanishing of the loop function at a certain low - energy point .",
    "then the value of the subtraction constant is determined , once again , for the loop function without cdd poles .",
    "in this section , we discuss the origin of the dynamically generated resonances by reanalyzing the simplest phenomenological model to determine the subtraction constant in the chiral unitary approach , in comparison with the natural renormalization scheme .",
    "let us assume that we have enough experimental data for the system of interest from the low - energy to the resonance - energy region . from the viewpoint of the renormalization , once the scattering amplitude @xmath90 ( observable ) is fixed , the change of the renormalization parameter in the loop function @xmath91 can be absorbed into the change of the interaction @xmath76 .",
    "in other words , we can not determine _ a priori _ the interaction kernel and the loop function separately .",
    "thus , for a given amplitude @xmath90 , we can construct different sets of interaction @xmath76 and loop function @xmath91 , @xmath92 where @xmath34 labels the renormalization scheme .",
    "once we specify either the loop function @xmath91 or the interaction kernel @xmath76 , we also determine the other one by eq .   to reproduce the same amplitude @xmath90 .    in the conventional phenomenological approaches ,",
    "the interaction kernel @xmath76 is determined in the beginning by chiral perturbation theory .",
    "for instance , in the simplest models , the interaction kernel @xmath76 is chosen to be the leading order wt term , @xmath93 with the subtraction constant @xmath94 in the loop function @xmath91 being a free parameter to reproduce experimental data .",
    "we call this procedure the phenomenological renormalization scheme .",
    "this scheme can describe various phenomena well , but the subtraction constant does not always satisfy the natural renormalization condition in eq .  .",
    "such a subtraction constant takes care of the contributions that are not included in the interaction kernel @xmath95 .",
    "the renormalization condition proposed in the previous section is to fix the subtraction constant such that in the resulting loop function there is no contribution from states below the threshold . to achieve the equivalent scattering amplitude , we need to adopt a different interaction kernel @xmath96 as @xmath97 with the subtraction constant @xmath98 given in eq .  .",
    "the interaction kernel @xmath96 should be modified from @xmath95 in order to reproduce experimental observables .",
    "the physical observable @xmath90 should equivalently be reproduced by both renormalization schemes .",
    "thus , equating the denominators of eqs .   and",
    "@xmath99 we obtain the interaction kernel @xmath96 in the natural renormalization scheme as @xmath100 with @xmath101 .",
    "here we have exploited the fact that the dependence of @xmath34 in the loop function @xmath91 reads constant shift , as seen in eq .  .",
    "using the explicit form of the wt term , we finally obtain the interaction kernel in the natural renormalization condition as @xmath102 with an effective mass @xmath103 hereafter , we call @xmath104 the effective interaction in the natural renormalization scheme . the expression in eq .",
    "tells us that the interaction kernel @xmath105 can have a pole , which lies in the @xmath5-channel scattering region with an attractive interaction @xmath106 and a negative value for @xmath107 . extracting the wt term from the effective interaction  , we find @xmath108 the second term can be interpreted as the pole whose energy dependence is consistent with the chiral expansion , since the pole term is quadratic in powers of the meson energy @xmath109 , while the leading wt term is linear in it .",
    "this is consistent with the schematic discussion made in refs .",
    "@xcite that the change of the subtraction constant may introduce the effect of the higher order terms in the kernel interaction .",
    "mathematically , it is also possible to have a pole for a repulsive interaction @xmath110 with @xmath111 .",
    "if the experiments require such a value for the phenomenological subtraction constant , the effective interaction would be the repulsive contact interaction plus an explicit resonance term .",
    "the @xmath6 scattering amplitude in the linear @xmath112 model is an example of this case  @xcite .    the relevance of the second term of eq .",
    "depends on the scale of the effective mass @xmath113 , which is obtained by the difference of the phenomenological and natural subtraction constants @xmath107 .",
    "if @xmath107 is small , the effective pole mass @xmath114 becomes large . in this case , the second term of eq .   can be neglected or gives smooth energy dependence in the resonance energy region @xmath115 .",
    "if the difference @xmath107 is large , the effective mass @xmath113 gets closer to the threshold . in this case ,",
    "the pole contribution is no longer negligible .",
    "this means that the use of a negative @xmath107 with large absolute value is equivalent to the introduction of a pole in the chiral lagrangian .",
    "we therefore consider that the pole in the effective interaction is a source of the physical resonances in this case .",
    "it was known that the higher order term could be a source of a resonance in the full amplitude , because these terms behave as the contracted resonance propagator in the @xmath5 channel . here",
    "we point out a possible source of the resonance in the conventional chiral unitary model , even if we use the leading order chiral interaction .    at this stage ,",
    "two renormalization schemes   and are interpreted as follows . in the phenomenological scheme",
    ", the interaction kernel @xmath95 does not include the cdd pole contribution , while in the natural scheme   the loop function @xmath91 does not contain the cdd pole , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "therefore , when the physical amplitude contains the cdd pole contribution , the effect is attributed to @xmath116 in the phenomenological scheme , while to @xmath117 in the natural scheme .",
    "indeed , we have demonstrated that @xmath105 contains a resonance propagator . in the limit",
    "@xmath118 , the two schemes agree with each other , which corresponds to the amplitude compatible with the meson - baryon picture of resonances , as explained in sec .  [",
    "sec : natural ] .",
    "note also that in the @xmath10 method , the cdd pole contributions except for those at infinity should be included in the interaction kernel @xmath76 , since the loop function @xmath91 expresses the only contribution from the unitarity cut . in this respect ,",
    "the phenomenological scheme has accommodated the cdd pole contribution in the loop function .",
    "in contrast , the natural scheme has more similarity to the formulation of the @xmath10 method , as the cdd pole contribution is explicitly seen in the interaction kernel .",
    "it is worth noting that the energy dependence of the interaction @xmath48 leads to the pole in the effective interaction , since the effective pole mass @xmath114 is obtained by solving the equation @xmath119 thus , for an energy - independent interaction @xmath76 , no pole can appear .",
    "taking into account that the coupling should be a derivative type in the nonlinear realization of chiral symmetry , the mechanism can be applied to any unitarized model with chiral interaction , such as @xmath112 and @xmath7 mesons in the meson - meson scattering .",
    "the interaction kernel in the natural renormalization scheme @xmath117 can also be expressed by renormalizing @xmath107 to an effective coupling strength @xmath120 : @xmath121 where the change of the coupling strength is then given by @xmath122 in the region of @xmath5-channel scattering @xmath87 for attractive interaction @xmath106 , we find that positive @xmath107 increases @xmath123 ( and the interaction becomes less attractive ) , and negative @xmath107 decreases @xmath123 ( more attractive ) . in this way",
    ", we can translate the change of the subtraction constant into the change of the strength of the interaction kernel .",

    "are well reproduced by the natural renormalization with the wt term , indicating that the @xmath0 resonance is a ( mostly ) pure dynamical resonance .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath12 scattering and the @xmath1 resonance is not reproduced by the wt term only , and the translation of the phenomenological subtraction constants into the low - energy effective interaction requires a pole term of which the mass is around 1700 mev in addition to the wt interaction . at the same time , the dynamical component is also important for the structure of @xmath1 , since the attractive interaction of the wt term is strong enough to generate a resonance in the natural renormalization , and the coupling property of @xmath1 is closer to the dynamical resonance . therefore , we interpret @xmath1 as mixture of a pole singularity of genuine state with the dynamical component .",
    "the results of the present analysis can be argued in various theoretical perspectives .",
    "there are several discussions about the structure of the baryon resonances : three - quark versus five - quark , or hadronic molecule versus quark originated structure . in principle",
    ", all these structures eventually stem from qcd dynamics and mix with each other .",
    "nevertheless , it helps our physical understanding to extract several components out of a resonance state and inspect the dominant contribution to the resonance .",
    "for instance , the @xmath0 resonance can be schematically decomposed as  @xcite @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the dynamical meson - baryon component in the scattering theory of hadrons  @xcite ; and the rest , which corresponds to the cdd pole and is not represented by the meson - baryon state , is expanded by the number of quarks .",
    "according to the decomposition  , the present analysis for @xmath0 unveils a large weight of the @xmath176 .",
    "probably , the best way to disentangle the dynamical component from the cdd pole contribution is the model - independent determination proposed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the applicability of this method is limited , and it seems to be difficult to deal with the resonances considered in this paper  @xcite .",
    "therefore , our analysis , though studied in a specific model , can be regarded as an alternative approach to this subject with larger applicability .    another powerful method for clarifying the internal structure of the resonances",
    "is the use of the number of colors @xmath177 .",
    "it is well known that the only @xmath9 meson survives in the large @xmath8 limit .",
    "the property of the meson resonances in the large @xmath8 limit was studied in a dynamical approach  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the @xmath7 meson survives in the large @xmath8 limit while the @xmath112 disappears , indicating the @xmath9 nature of the former resonance .",
    "a systematic study of the @xmath8 scaling of the resonance parameters around @xmath178 was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , leading to the same conclusion for the properties of the mesonic resonances . in the context of the baryon resonance , the scaling behavior of the @xmath179 baryon with @xmath8",
    "is known from the general argument , so it is possible to investigate whether the @xmath180 component dominates .",
    "the method of @xmath8 scaling has been applied to @xmath0 in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the @xmath8 behavior of both poles for @xmath0 given in eq .   indicates their non-@xmath179 structure . concerning @xmath0 , the present result ( @xmath176 dominates ) and the result in ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath181 ) consistently imply that the @xmath0 resonance is dominated by the meson - baryon molecular component .    as for @xmath1",
    ", we have found substantial contribution other than those from @xmath176 .",
    "there is an interesting possibility of the origin of this cdd pole contribution : a chiral partner of the ground state nucleon .",
    "the chiral partner is a parity pair of the particles which transform each other under the linear realization of the chiral transformation and become degenerate when chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "familiar candidates are @xmath182 and @xmath183 in the meson sector . since @xmath1 is the lowest negative - parity state having the same quantum number as the ground state nucleon , it is a candidate for the chiral partner of the nucleon  @xcite . in the linear realization of chiral symmetry ,",
    "the chiral partner is introduced as an explicit field in the chiral symmetric lagrangian .",
    "such an explicit field is expressed as a cdd pole in the chiral unitary approach .",
    "therefore , the cdd pole found here could be interpreted as the chiral partner of the nucleon .    on the other hand , as indicated by the coupling - strength analysis , the strong meson - baryon interaction in the @xmath12 channel also provides a sizable meson - baryon component on top of the quark - originated @xmath1 . in ref",
    "@xcite , electrotransition form factors of @xmath1 , namely , the helicity amplitudes @xmath184 and @xmath185 , have been discussed in the meson - baryon picture .",
    "there @xmath1 is expressed by the chiral unitary approach with the phenomenological renormalization scheme and the transition @xmath186 was computed by considering the photon coupling only to the constituent meson and baryon in @xmath1",
    ". then helicity amplitudes were fairly reproduced , and the ratio @xmath187 agreed well with experimental data .",
    "the success of this calculation without the photon coupling to the possibly quark - originated pole term in the effective interaction implies that the meson - baryon components of @xmath1 are essential for the structure of @xmath1 proved by low - energy virtual photon .",
    "it is instructive to recall the study of exotic hadrons in the chiral unitary approach  @xcite where the natural renormalization scheme was adopted .",
    "it turned out that the attractive interaction of the wt term in exotic channels is not strong enough to generate a bound state in the su(3 ) limit .",
    "as emphasized in the present paper , the natural renormalization scheme , together with the wt term as the interaction kernel , excludes the cdd pole contribution in the scattering amplitude .",
    "thus , the conclusion of refs .",
    "@xcite is the absence of the @xmath5-wave exotic hadrons which are dynamically generated by a meson and baryon without the cdd pole contribution .",
    "we have performed a detailed study of the formulation of the chiral unitary approach in order to understand the origin of baryon resonances .",
    "we point out that a certain choice for the subtraction constants in the dimensional regularization leads to the positive value of the loop function below threshold . avoiding this and matching the amplitude with the low - energy interaction , we construct the `` natural renormalization '' scheme for the loop function in which the cdd pole contribution is excluded .",
    "we emphasize again that this scheme is not always applied to the physical scattering system .",
    "but rather our aim is to study the structure of the interaction kernel , using the natural renormalization scheme as a starting point .",
    "we then consider the physical meson - baryon scattering with experimental data .",
    "we compare the natural renormalization scheme with the phenomenological scheme in which the subtraction constants are fitted to the experimental data keeping the interaction kernel unchanged . from the viewpoint of the renormalization , we show that the same amplitude can be expressed by the natural renormalization scheme with an effective interaction kernel which exhibits a propagator of an elementary particle .",
    "this means the necessity of a seed of the resonance in the kernel interaction when the subtraction constant differs from the natural value .",
    "this is another mechanism of the cdd pole contribution even if the kernel interaction does not include the contracted resonance propagator in the low - energy constant .",
    "although both renormalization schemes achieve the same scattering amplitude , the natural scheme is suitable for decomposing the singularity of the amplitude along the same line as the @xmath10 method .",
    "we analyze the @xmath11 and @xmath12 meson - baryon scatterings in which the @xmath0 and @xmath1 resonances are dynamically generated . utilizing the phenomenological fitting ,",
    "we show that @xmath0 can be generated in the natural renormalization scheme with the weinberg - tomozawa term , while @xmath1 requires substantial correction in addition to the leading order chiral interaction , especially a pole singularity at around 1700 mev .",
    "these facts indicate that @xmath0 can be regarded almost purely as a dynamical state of the meson - baryon scattering , while @xmath1 may have an appreciable component originated from quark dynamics , together with the dynamical component as indicated by the coupling properties .",
    "our analysis can be applied to any system described by the chiral unitary approach .",
    "we have also emphasized the importance of the phenomenological fitting to the data , otherwise we can not extract the correct low - energy structure which is necessary to interpret the origin of the resonance .",
    "hence , precise determination of the meson - hadron scattering data will enable us to further study the properties of hadron resonances .",

    "<S> we study the origin of the resonances associated with pole singularities of the scattering amplitude in the chiral unitary approach . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a `` natural renormalization '' scheme using the low - energy interaction and the general principle of the scattering theory . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a method to distinguish dynamically generated resonances from genuine quark states [ castillejo - dalitz - dyson ( cdd ) poles ] using the natural renormalization scheme and phenomenological fitting . analyzing physical meson - baryon scatterings , we find that the @xmath0 resonance is largely dominated by the meson - baryon molecule component . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the @xmath1 resonance requires a sizable cdd pole contribution , while the effect of the meson - baryon dynamics is also important . </S>"
