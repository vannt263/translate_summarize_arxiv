    "the interactions between colloidal particles can be complex and varied . in order to understand and determine the interactions one must not only consider the direct or ` bare ' interactions between the colloids themselves , but also the influence of the medium in which they are dispersed ( the solvent ) .",
    "for example , if the colloids carry a net charge @xmath0 , they will tend to repel each other .",
    "however , the strength of this repulsive interaction is determined not only by the magnitude of the charge @xmath0 , but also by the concentration and types of counterions in the solvent .",
    "the counterions may condense on the surface of the colloids , forming an oppositely charged double - layer around the colloids , which screens the coulomb interaction .",
    "thus the range and strength of this repulsive interaction may be determined by controlling the concentration and type of coions and counterions in the solvent @xcite .",
    "the interaction between the colloids may also be influenced by the presence of other species in the solvent , such as polymeric macromolecules . if these polymers adhere to the surface of the colloids they form a soft layer surrounding the particles thus effectively increasing their size .",
    "such adsorbing polymers may be used to stabilise the colloids in suspension . on the other hand , non - adsorbing polymers",
    "have the effect of generating an effective attraction between the colloids .",
    "this depletion interaction arises due to the fact that when the separation between two colloids becomes less than @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the polymer radius of gyration , then the polymer chains are unlikely to be found between the two colloids since such confinement entails an entropic cost .",
    "this depletion results in an unbalanced osmotic pressure on the colloids by the polymers , generating an effective attraction between the pair of colloids @xcite .    in the last few years",
    "there have been a number of studies of systems of charged colloidal particles dispersed in a solvent containing nonadsorbing polymers @xcite .",
    "due to that fact that in these systems the charge is only weakly screened , there is a competition between a short ranged ( depletion ) attraction due to the presence of the polymers in the solution and a longer ranged ( screened coulomb ) repulsive interaction .",
    "the competing interactions give rise to microphase separated fluid phases ",
    "i.e.  to fluid states exhibiting equilibrium modulated structures such as clusters or stripes . other mechanisms leading to this kind of competition are also possible . for instance",
    ", the attraction may be due to dispersion forces instead of osmotic depletion . even with neutral particles interacting solely via depletion forces , competition may arise as a consequence of mutual interactions between the depletants , which modify the interaction potential with respect to the simplest asakura - oosawa picture @xcite . structuring and",
    "pattern formation has also been seen in two dimensional systems @xcite , where the repulsion is likely to be due to dipole - dipole interactions between the particles at the surface . together with these experimental studies",
    ", there has been significant theoretical interest in model colloidal systems exhibiting such competing interactions @xcite .",
    "an overview of the results and conclusions drawn from this body of work is given in ref .",
    "@xcite , and will not be repeated here .",
    "a simple model for these colloidal systems was considered by some of us previously @xcite .",
    "we model the ` bare ' interaction between the colloids as a hard - sphere interaction , the long ranged screened coulomb repulsion with a yukawa potential and we model the depletion attraction using an additional yukawa potential .",
    "thus the pair potential in our model is as follows : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the hard - sphere pair potential : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the hard sphere - diameter and @xmath7 the first term in @xmath8 is the ( attractive ) depletion interaction and the second term is the ( repulsive ) screened coulomb interaction .",
    "the magnitudes of the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 are determined by the concentration of non - adsorbing polymers in the solution and the charge carried by the colloids , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 is roughly the size ratio between the colloids and the polymers and the parameter @xmath12 is determined by the concentration and type of screening ions in the solvent . in the present work we consider the case when @xmath13 , so that the pair potential @xmath14 is repulsive for large @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "however , at intermediate distances @xmath16 between the particles , @xmath14 may be attractive ",
    "i.e.  @xmath17 .",
    "this occurs when the parameter @xmath18 . in this case",
    "there is a competition between the long range repulsion and the shorter ranged attraction .",
    "depending on the values of the set of pair potential parameters @xmath19 , the fluid temperature @xmath20 and number density @xmath21 , this model may exhibit various modulated phases @xcite .",
    "the precise nature of the phase transition from the uniform fluid phase to the modulated fluid phases is not well understood . in ref .",
    "@xcite some of us developed a density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite for the present model .",
    "it was found that the dft provided a good account of the structure and thermodynamics of the uniform liquid .",
    "the theory also predicts that for certain choices of the parameters @xmath19 and the temperature @xmath20 , there exists an interval of the fluid density @xmath21 where the uniform fluid becomes unstable against periodic density fluctuations of a certain wavelength , indicating that there must be a phase transition to an inhomogeneous ( modulated ) phase .",
    "the locus of this line in the phase diagram is called the @xmath22-line @xcite .    following the study in ref .",
    "@xcite , a further study was made using monte - carlo ( mc ) computer simulations and integral equation theories @xcite , in order to determine the nature of phase transition occurring at the @xmath22-line .",
    "the results from the integral equation theories were mostly inconclusive  all the closure relations that were implemented either failed to describe the phase transition or had no solution in the region of the phase diagram where the inhomogeneous phases are expected , with the exception of the percus - yevick ( py ) closure , which is able to describe to some extent the nature of the transition from the low density homogeneous phase to the modulated ( cluster ) phase .",
    "however , this theory also failed to have a solution at higher densities .",
    "the picture that emerged from the mc simulations was that for certain values of @xmath10 and @xmath23 there is a first order phase transition from a low density homogeneous phase to a modulated ( cluster ) phase and also at higher densities a first order phase transition from a modulated ( bubble ) phase to the uniform liquid @xcite .",
    "it was found that there is a difference in the densities @xmath24 between these coexisting phases .",
    "however , @xmath24 was found to be a fairly small quantity , which means that the density @xmath21 is not a good order parameter for this phase transition .",
    "we show below that the amplitude of the density modulations @xmath25 proves to be a better order parameter for this phase transition . on following either of these two first order transitions to larger values of @xmath23",
    ", one finds that @xmath26 .",
    "the two critical points , at which these two transitions cease to be first order ( i.e.  when @xmath27 ) are difficult to locate using mc simulations @xcite .",
    "one reason for this was due to a lack of knowledge of the relevant order parameter for the phase transition . based on a comparison with the phase behaviour of lattice models with competing interactions @xcite ,",
    "it was concluded that the two critical points were most likely to be tricritical points @xcite , connected to one - another by a line of second order ( continuous ) transitions .",
    "however , it was not possible to see any signature of the second order transition line in the mc simulation results , leaving the conclusions somewhat tentative .    in the present work we use dft to examine the phase behaviour in the vicinity of the @xmath22-line and we find that the theory confirms the scenario proposed in ref .  @xcite ",
    "i.e.  that the critical points are indeed tricritical points and that connecting these is the @xmath22-line itself  a line of second order transitions",
    ". we also use the dft theory to develop an order parameter ( landau ) theory for the phase transition , by making a sinusoidal approximation for the density modulations and then expanding the free energy in powers of the order parameter @xmath25 , allowing us to investigate the transition in detail .",
