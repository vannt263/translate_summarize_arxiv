    "the last decade has been witness to incredible progress in the fabrication of high quality factor mechanical resonators ( mr ) in the nano - scale characterized by fundamental frequencies in the 100 mhz to 1 ghz range .",
    "control of such systems in the quantum limit has emerged as a very active field of research with implications for ultra - sensitive sensing technologies , quantum information processing as well as fundamental tests of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "a key required feature for applications in the quantum limit is the ability to engineer well - defined quantum states of the mr .",
    "the properties of a thermal mr can be manipulated through controlled quantum mechanical coupling with electromagnetic radiation .",
    "indeed , this forms a powerful avenue to cool the mechanical systems , coherently control their evolution and measure them .",
    "recently , various techniques have been proposed to cool the mrs to their motional ground states , such as bang - bang cooling  @xcite , single - shot state - swapping cooling via a superconductor  @xcite , side - band laser cooling  @xcite-@xcite , electromagnetically - induced - transparency cooling @xcite , dynamic dissipative cooling @xcite , and through repeated projective measurements on an auxiliary flux qubit  @xcite . in this paper , we consider protocols for preparation of pure coherent states , instead of ground states , of mrs from initial general states ( e.g. , thermal states ) .",
    "such coherent states can be used as inputs _",
    "e.g. _ for schemes to generate superpositions of spatially separated quantum states ( so - called schrdinger cat states ) that can be used to study quantum behaviour , as well as the transition from quantum to classical behaviour , in macroscopically populated ( phonon ) states of mrs @xcite .",
    "we note here that a scheme for generating schrdinger cats in a mechanical system was discussed in @xcite in the case of a mr capacitively coupled to a cooper - pair box , which assumes the availability of an initial coherent state without providing for an explicit method of engineering it .",
    "in contrast with the conventional resolved sideband cooling scheme where the mr reaches the steady state , our previous work shows that the mr cooling can be realized by repeated projective measurements on the auxiliary flux qubit @xcite . here , instead of ground state cooling of mr ,",
    "we propose a cooling scheme to drive the mr directly into a coherent state by repeated random measurements .",
    "we consider here a doubly clamped mr coupled to a gradiometer - type superconducting flux qubit  @xcite ( the schemes presented here formally work for coupling to any two level system ) .",
    "the simplest such system can be described by the effective hamiltonian  @xcite : @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the free hamiltonian of the flux qubit , the second term represents the free hamiltonian @xmath2 of the mr with fundamental frequency @xmath3 , while the third term describes the interaction between these two systems @xmath4 . in the pauli spin-1/2 representation ,",
    "the flux qubit hamiltonian in the basis of equal superpositions of persistent currents @xmath5 is described by a bias energy term @xmath6 , that is set to zero by trapping a half - flux quantum in the superconducting loop  @xcite , and a tunnelling term between the persistent current states , _ i.e. _ @xmath7 .",
    "we shall consider the weak coupling limit , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath8 . in this regime , the rotating wave approximation applies and the system is described by the jaynes - cummings model : @xmath9 where @xmath10 . in a previous paper by some of us @xcite , based on the system described by the above jc hamiltonian ( [ jcham ] ) , a feasible scheme for the ground - state cooling of a mr was achieved via projective measurements on an auxiliary flux qubit which interacts with it . for the protocols to generate coherent states , we shall require the mr to be displaced in space by @xmath11 .",
    "to this end , let us assume a flux qubit - mr model whose orginal hamiltonian is given through a displacement transformation @xmath12 to the jc hamiltonian ( [ jcham ] ) ( up to a constant term ) @xmath13 initially , we assume that the flux qubit+mr system is prepared in the product state @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the ground state of the free flux - qubit hamiltonian , while the mr is in some general state with non - zero overlap with the coherent state we want to prepare .",
    "the basic constituent of the protocols , we present , for driving the mr to a coherent state is a quantum - zeno type effect : the flux - qubit+mr is allowed to undergo dynamic evolution under the hamiltonian ( [ effham ] ) which is interrupted by a series of randomly timed projected measurements on to the ground state of the flux qubit @xmath16 .",
    "we show below that after @xmath17 consecutive measurements on the qubit yielding outcomes @xmath18 , the state of the mr will approach the coherent state @xmath19 with fidelity increasing to 1 as @xmath17 increases .",
    "notice that the effective evolution operator pertaining to the mr encompassing a single measurement at time @xmath20 can be disentangled to the form @xmath21 where from ( [ effham ] ) @xmath22 and furthermore @xmath23 is the displacement operator@xcite .",
    "after one measurement @xmath24    thus after n consecutive measurements of the flux qubit ground state performed at times @xmath25 , the density matrix of the mr is @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the success probability of this process is @xmath29    we first analyze the properties of the above success probability .",
    "the jaynes - cummings evolution @xmath30 , due to the symmetry associated with conservation of total number of excitations @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the excited state of the flux qubit , is easily decomposed into 2 dimensional sectors , apart from the the space of 0 excitations which is 1-dimensional @xcite .",
    "the conditional evolution operator @xmath33 therefore is diagonal in the phonon basis @xmath34 of the mr ( corresponding to @xmath2 ) : @xmath35 with complex eigenvalues @xmath36 and for @xmath37 , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the rabi frequency .",
    "the parameter @xmath40 measures the ratio of the effective interaction energy scale to the deviation from resonance , according to the equation : @xmath41 .",
    "note that @xmath42 is conserved due to effective decoupling of the zero phonon state during the conditional evolution , while for random times @xmath20 the coefficients @xmath43 for higher phonon states @xmath37 .",
    "hence after @xmath17 consecutive measurements of the flux qubit ground state , the mr is driven into the state ( [ densitymr ] ) given explicitly as @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "the success probability of realizing the conditional evolution ( [ survival ] ) is thus : @xmath46 where the second line comes about from the cyclic property of the trace and unitarity of the displacement operator @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the diagonal matrix element of the effective input density matrix .    on the other hand , the fidelity of the state of the mr ( [ eq:4 ] ) with the coherent state @xmath49",
    "is given by : @xmath50 where in the last line we have used the fact that @xmath51 .",
    "this result shows that in order to obtain a non - zero fidelity with a coherent state @xmath11 , the effective input density matrix must have a non - zero overlap with the phonon vacuum .",
    "we now turn to the asymptotic characteristics of our method . due to the properties of the eigenvalues @xmath52 mentioned earlier , the products over different times @xmath53 as the number of measurements @xmath54 for all @xmath55 and only @xmath56 .",
    "thus asymptotically , @xmath57 using this , we see from ( [ fidelity ] ) that the fidelity asymptotically tends to 1 , which shows that one effectively obtains the coherent state of the mr .",
    "importantly , the results ( [ fidelity],[asym1 ] ) also imply , that by measuring the ground state of the ancillary system , in this case the flux qubit , many times , one basically remotely implements the coherent state projective measurement on the initial state of the mr which is hard to implement directly .",
    "indeed , ( [ asym1 ] ) shows that the asymptotic success probability of the protocol is given by the probability of projecting the initial state on the target , coherent state @xmath19 .",
    "the characteristics of the described process depend on the initial state @xmath58 of the mr . in",
    "what follows , we consider two , rather natural , possible , initializations of the mr and compare the performance of the above described protocol .",
    "consider the initial state of the mr to be the thermal state @xmath59 $ ] @xmath60 , where the probability @xmath61 with average phonon excitation at inverse temperature @xmath62 given by the planck formula @xmath63 $ ] and @xmath34 is the phonon state basis of the undisplaced mr .",
    "this can be obained by allowing the mr to thermalize , while the interaction with the flux qubit ( @xmath4 ) as well as the `` displacement '' term for the mr , i.e. , the second term in ( [ effham ] ) , is switched off .",
    "then the interaction as well as the displacement term are switched on at time @xmath64 followed subsequently by measurements of the qubit ground state .",
    "the success probability of n consecutive measurements ( [ survival1 ] ) in this case becomes @xmath65 where the matrix elements of the displacement operator @xmath66 reads    @xmath67    [ displacement ]    in the last equality we have used the relation @xmath68 for @xmath69 .",
    "we also applied this property for coherent states @xmath70    after rearranging terms , this probability is written as @xmath71    on the other hand , the fidelity ( [ fidelity ] ) reads @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the phonon number probability distribution in a coherent state @xmath11 .",
    "we show below , that for this class of states , the mr can be driven into a coherent state only for coherent parameters below some critical value @xmath74 which depends on the temperature or equivalently the average phonon number of the thermal mr .",
    "indeed , this stems from the decreasing overlap at a given temperature of the phonon number probability distribution @xmath75 of the thermal state , which is geometric with maximum value for the vacuum , and the phonon number distribution of the coherent state @xmath76 which is poissonian and centred at the average phonon excitation value @xmath77 .",
    "thus to drive the mr into coherent states with higher average phonon numbers will require higher temperatures .",
    "for a given temperature , the restriction on the coherent state parameter can be avoided , using a scheme based on a different input state . indeed , consider instead the thermal state corresponding to the displaced mr .",
    "unlike in the previous scenario , we therefore consider a setup where the mr is first displaced , followed by a period of thermalization , after which the interaction is abruptly switched on followed by implementation of the driving protocol . in this scenario ,",
    "the input state is the thermal state of the displaced mr , @xmath78 @xmath79/z = d(\\alpha)\\,\\rho_{m}\\ , d^{\\dagger}(\\alpha)$ ] , where @xmath80\\right\\ } $ ] and @xmath81 is the thermal state of the undisplaced mr , as given in the previous section .    under this assumption , the new density operator matrix after n consecutive successful measurements , is @xmath82 which is simply the displacement of the thermal state of the ( undisplaced ) mr .",
    "the success probability is simply @xmath83 which is independent of the coherent state parameter @xmath11 and asymptotically ( [ asym1 ] ) is @xmath84 , _",
    "i.e. _ the occupation probability of the vacuum state of the bare mr at the given temperature .",
    "we now study quantitative characteristics of the two presented driving protocols numerically .",
    "we consider a realistic @xmath85 mhz nano - mechanical resonator with quality factor @xmath86 , coupled near - resonantly to a flux qubit non - resonantly with a tunnelling splitting @xmath87 .",
    "we first consider the scheme described in sec .",
    "the mr is taken to be in equilibrium at the ambient temperature @xmath88 mk , which corresponds to a mean phonon number of 3.69 .",
    "the coupling constant is assumed @xmath89 and the measurement times @xmath90 are randomly selected .",
    "figure  [ plot ] shows the evolution of the fidelity ( [ fidelity ] ) with increasing number of projective measurements for different values of @xmath11 up to @xmath91 above which the asymptotic success probability @xmath92 .     for different values of @xmath11",
    "after @xmath17 projective measurements using @xmath93 and the time interval within which a single projective measurement is performed is @xmath94 . ]",
    "the fidelity approaches the asymptotic value of @xmath95 for all @xmath11 s within 30 measurement steps . in these cases ,",
    "the mr is driven close to the coherent state @xmath96 as can be seen also by considering the average phonon number @xmath97 which is the sum of thermal - like and coherent - like contributions .",
    "the thermal - like contribution @xmath98 can be calculated by subtracting the coherent like contribution @xmath99 from the average phonon number @xmath100 in the calculated final state ( [ eq:4 ] ) .",
    "the thermal - like contribution after 30 measurements is @xmath101 . in figure [ plot2 ]",
    ", we consider the variation of the success probability of obtaining @xmath17 consecutive ground state measurements of the flux qubit . for @xmath102 ( red curve ) , this probability changes very slowly after @xmath103 measurements showing that the coherent state has practically been achieved . on the other hand ,",
    "as we approach the value @xmath104 the survival probability becomes very small , _",
    "i.e. _ we practically no longer can obtain the flux qubit in its ground state .",
    "indeed for @xmath105 ( green curve ) the survival probability saturates to a very small value within ten measurements .     for different values of @xmath11 .",
    "red triangles denote the case @xmath102 .",
    "green triangles denote the case @xmath105 .",
    "the controllable parameters are the same as in figure  [ plot ] . ]    from the results above , the asymptotic probability of success ( with number of measurements @xmath54 ) is seen to be a measure of obtaining a coherent state with fidelity @xmath95 .",
    "it decreases to zero with increase of the coherent displacement parameter @xmath11 as shown in figure [ plotasym ] .     that is sought to be obtained . ]",
    "we now consider the scheme described in sec .",
    "4 . figure [ plotpropose ] presents the same physical quantities as figure  [ plot ] and figure  [ plot2 ] for a thermal state of the physically displaced mr .",
    "we consider a higher bath temperature @xmath106 mk with mean phonon number 7.84 .",
    "after 30 measurements , the thermal - like contribution is @xmath107 , thus , the average phonon number is @xmath108 .",
    "it is noticeable that in this framework the coherent state is always reached after 30 measurements . as mentioned in the previous section ,",
    "the characteristics of the protocol including the fidelity with the coherent state ( see ( [ proposal ] ) ) is independent of the displacement parameter .",
    "( b ) fidelity .",
    "the parameters are @xmath106 mk and @xmath109 . ]",
    "we would like to remark that though the results for the protocols of sec . 3 and sec .",
    "4 are obtained for the case of randomly - timed measurements , they are equally valid if one performs equal or fixed time measurements . exact timing of measurements is however difficult to implement experimentally and indeed unfavourable . as shown in @xcite , randomly timed measurements result in faster dynamics towards asymptotic states of the mr .    in conclusion , we have demonstrated that quantum zeno effect - type schemes consisting of repeated measurements on an auxiliary two level system can drive a nano mechanical resonator in to a coherent state .",
    "we propose two different ways to realize coherent state : the first one is efficient for small values of @xmath11 , while the second one , with a displaced initial state of the mr , is robust for any value of the coherent parameter .",
    "the schemes work when the flux qubit and mr are coupled both resonantly or off - resonantly .",
    "we showed that the driving process is akin to performing a projective measurement on the mr without directly acting on it .",
