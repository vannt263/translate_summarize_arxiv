    "ace measurements by wiedenbeck et al . (",
    "53 ) of the cosmic ray @xmath0ni/@xmath0co abundance ratio and optical measurements of the be / fe abundance ratios in old stars , e.g. molaro et al .",
    "( 34 ) and boesgaard et al .",
    "( 4 ) , have shown us that the making of cosmic rays is like the making of fine wine . both have to be aged and blended .",
    "cosmic rays can not be too young and fresh , because their low ratio of k - capture @xmath0ni to its daughter @xmath0co requires an age of @xmath2 years before acceleration , and they can not be too old and diluted , because the roughly constant ratio of cosmic ray produced be to supernova produced fe requires the metallicity in the matter from which the cosmic rays are accelerated to be roughly constant within a factor of @xmath32 .",
    "this can be achieved if the metallicity is dominated by supernova ejecta .",
    "the cellar where all of this aging and blending happens quite naturally is the vast metal - enriched superbubble / hot phase of the interstellar medium ( sb / hism ) , where most supernovae occur .",
    "this can be seen from the extensive studies of galactic and extragalactic supernovae , their progenitors and their cosmic ray accelerating remnants , and of the chemical enrichment and evolution of the interstellar medium , that we will review here with special emphasis on the metallicity and filling factor of the sb / hism .",
    "we also discuss how ace and other measurements of the cosmic ray composition can define these two properties in the region of cosmic ray acceleration .",
    "the source of energy for cosmic ray acceleration is thought to be shock waves driven by the expansion energy of supernova ejecta , e.g. blandford & ostriker ( 3 ) and axford ( 1 ) .",
    "the power required to maintain the galactic cosmic rays is about 10@xmath4 ergs@xmath5 , e.g. lingenfelter ( 23 ) .",
    "the galactic supernova rate is about 3 supernovae per century , e.g. van den bergh & mcclure ( 49 ) , most of which ( 80 to 90% ) are core - collapse ( type ii and ib / c ) supernovae of relatively young ( @xmath6 few 10@xmath7 yrs ) massive o and b stars ; the remainder are type ia thermonuclear explosions of much older accreting white dwarfs .",
    "thus , the average cosmic ray energy needed per supernova is about 10@xmath8 ergs , which requires an acceleration efficiency of about 10% from the blast wave shocks of the supernovae , since supernovae all seem to have similar ejecta kinetic energies of about 10@xmath9 ergs , e.g. woosley & weaver ( 56 ) and nomoto et al .",
    "( 36 ) .",
    "the source of the particles that are accelerated as cosmic rays and the site of their acceleration , however , are still debated .",
    "but if the energy comes from supernova shocks , the site and source of the particles clearly must be in the material through which the shocks pass .",
    "new clues to origin of the particles come from recent measurements , e.g. molaro et al .",
    "( 34 ) and boesgaard et al .",
    "( 4 ) , of be / fe abundances in old halo stars that show that the ratio of cosmic ray spallation produced be relative to core - collapse supernova - produced fe has remained roughly constant throughout the evolution of the galaxy .",
    "this constancy requires ( ramaty , kozlovsky & lingenfelter ( 38 ) ; ramaty , lingenfelter & kozlovsky ( 40 ) ) that the cosmic rays be accelerated out of matter that is only partially diluted by mixing with the interstellar medium ( ism ) so that it is still sufficiently enriched in supernova - synthesized metals that its metallicity did not changed by more than @xmath32 over galactic evolution .",
    "detailed calculations by ramaty et al .",
    "( 42 ) and ramaty , lingenfelter & kozlovsky ( 41 ) of the production and evolution of the galactic be / fe ratio clearly show that the bulk of the cosmic rays can not be accelerated from the well - mixed ism , as has been recently assumed , e.g. meyer et al .",
    "( 33 ) and ellison et al . (",
    "just such a metal - enriched environment is where most supernovae do in fact occur and through which most of the cosmic ray accelerating , supernova shocks propagate .",
    "as we have discussed in higdon , lingenfelter & ramaty ( 17,18 ) , extensive observations show that the bulk of the core - collapse supernova progenitors are formed in ob associations in giant molecular clouds and that the combined winds and supernova ejecta of these stars form hot , low density superbubbles , that reach dimensions of several hundred pc and last for tens of myr . during this time",
    "the bulk of the supernova ejecta , the supernova shocks , and their cosmic ray acceleration are all confined within the superbubble / hot phase of the ism .",
    "core - collapse ( type ii and ib / c ) supernovae are highly correlated in space and time , e.g. mccray & snow ( 28 ) .",
    "such supernovae thus create giant cavities , or superbubbles , in the interstellar medium rather than many smaller , isolated bubbles , e.g. mac low & mccray ( 26 ) and tomisaka ( 48 ) .",
    "this is expected because 1 ) the massive o and b star supernova progenitors ( @xmath18 m@xmath10 ; e.g. woosley & weaver ( 56 ) ; nomoto et al .",
    "( 36 ) ) are not distributed uniformly in interstellar space , but tend to form clusters , since the majority of these massive stars are born in the most massive ( @xmath1 10@xmath11 m@xmath10 ) molecular clouds in gravitationally unbound ob associations , while less massive clouds are destroyed by the intense uv irradiation with the birth of their first o star ( mckee & williams ( 30 ) ) ; and 2 ) these stars are short - lived and slow moving ; the progenitors of core - collapse supernovae have main sequence lifetimes of @xmath3 3 to 35 myr and ob stars in associations have dispersion velocities of only @xmath34 km s@xmath5 ( blaauw ( 2 ) ) , so they do not travel too far ( @xmath3120 pc in 30 myr ) from their birthplaces before they die in supernova explosions .",
    "consequently , the combined effect of these clustered supernova explosions is to create superbubbles , which expand and merge to form the hot ( @xmath110@xmath12 k ) , tenuous ( @xmath610@xmath13 cm@xmath13 ) phase of the ism with an average filling factor of @xmath3 50% , or more ( e.g. yorke ( 57 ) ; spitzer ( 45 ) ; mckee ( 29 ) ; rosen & bregman ( 43 ) ; korpi et al . ( 20 ) ) of the galactic disk ( with a scale height @xmath3100 pc ) and essentially all of the corona / halo ( with scale height of @xmath33 kpc ) .",
    "we discuss the spatial distribution of the sb / hism filling factor in more detail below .",
    "an analysis of the surface brightness distribution of the remnants of historical supernovae in our galaxy by ( higdon & lingenfelter ( 16 ) has shown that 85@xmath1510% , of the observed galactic supernovae occured in the superbubble hot phase of the ism .",
    "this is quite consistent with more extensive observations of supernovae in other late type galaxies .",
    "as discussed in detail in higdon et al .",
    "( 17 ) , the combined observations of van dyk et al .",
    "( 51 ) and kennicutt , edgar , & hodge ( 19 ) show that the great majority , @xmath3 90@xmath1510% , of the core - collapse supernovae in late type galaxies also occur within superbubbles , and because of the large filling factor of the superbubble , hot - phase of the ism , half , or more , of the type ia should also occur within the superbubbles just by chance .",
    "thus , since core - collapse supernovae account for 80 to 90% of all supernovae in our galaxy and type ia make up the remainder , roughly 80% of all supernovae occur in the superbubble hot phase of the ism , and the bulk of the cosmic rays accelerated by their shocks are also produced there .",
    "the observed concentration of supernovae in the sb / hism and the subsequent cosmic ray acceleration in this hot ( @xmath16 k ) phase also argues strongly against a first - ionization - potential ( fip ) injection bias for cosmic ray enrichment which requires warm partially ionized gas , and does not work in the nearly fully ionized gas of the sb / hism .",
    "however , the sb / hism environment is quite consistent with cosmic ray source particle injection from the sputtering of the high velocity refractory grains formed in supernovae , see lingenfelter , ramaty & kozlovsky ( 25 ) and lingenfelter & ramaty ( 24 ) .",
    "such a volatility bias for cosmic ray refractory metal injection from sputtering of supernova grains was first suggested by cesarsky & bibring ( 7 ) and it was also recently proposed by meyer et al .",
    "( 33 ) for shock - accelerated , ice - stripped , refractory cores of grains in the warm ism .",
    "the occurrence of most supernovae in the sb / hism and cosmic ray acceleration in that hot phase also argues strongly against the mass / charge ( a / q)-dependent acceleration model of ellison et al . (",
    "11 ) for the volatile elements , because this too requires warm partially ionized gas , and ellison & meyer ( 12 ) argue it does not work in the highly ionized gas of the sb / hism .",
    "as we have shown in lingenfelter & ramaty ( 24 ) and discuss below , however , a mass dependent injection of volatiles appears to result quite naturally from the scattering of the ambient gas atoms in direct collisions with fast grain atoms that must accompany the sputtering of the grains .",
    "the bulk of the metals ( elements with z@xmath15 ) in the galaxy have been produced by supernovae and ejected into the ism .",
    "the relative abundances of most elements have remained relatively constant ( e.g. timmes , woosley & weaver ( 47 ) ) , because they simply reflect the imf - averaged supernova yields which do not depend strongly on the interstellar metallicity , e.g. woosley & weaver ( 56 ) .",
    "the averaged relative abundances of the present ism , e.g. savage & sembach ( 44 ) , the older ( 4.5 gyr ) solar system material , e.g. grevesse , noels & sauval ( 15 ) , and the imf - averaged fresh supernova ejecta , e.g. lingenfelter et al .",
    "( 25 ) , are all within about @xmath3 10% of one another .",
    "but their overall abundance in the ism ( i.e. the interstellar metallicity ) has grown steadily over time with the accumulation of fresh supernova ejecta continuously injected and mixed into the ism . the time scale for thorough mixing",
    "is generally thought ( e.g. mcwilliam ( 31 ) ; thomas , greggio & bender ( 46 ) ) to be on the order of 30 to 100 myr .",
    "this is comparable to the typical mean life of the sb / hism reservoir into which the bulk of the supernova ejecta with a metallicity 10 times solar ( e.g. woosley & weaver ( 56 ) ) is injected and in which the bulk of the mixing is expected to occur .",
    "thus , we would expect significant variations in the metallicity , but not in the abundances of most elements relative to one another , within the sb / hism as a function of the age of individual superbubbles and their generating ob associations .",
    "the average , or equillibrium , metallicity of the sb / hism is not known , but the supernova ejecta appear to be able to provide sufficient metals to produce a metallicity @xmath12 times solar , as is required ( ramaty et al .",
    "2000b ) for the cosmic ray source from the constancy of the be / fe abindances in old stars .",
    "this can be seen from a simple comparison of the total mass of the sb / hism and the mass of supernova ejecta produced during the mean life of the sb / hism .",
    "the total mass of the sb / hism is @xmath17 m@xmath10 , assuming an average , e.g. yorke ( 57 ) and spitzer ( 45 ) , sb / hism density of @xmath18 h/@xmath19 , a sb / hism scale height of @xmath3 3 kpc and an effective galactic radius of @xmath3 15 kpc . taking a nominal sb /",
    "hism mean life , or mixing time , @xmath20 100 myr , the required sb / hism input is @xmath21 m@xmath10/yr(@xmath22/100myr )",
    ". the present galactic snii / ibc rate of about 1 sn every 40 yr , producing an imf - averaged ejecta mass of 18 m@xmath10 , gives a galactic snii / ibc ejecta input of @xmath3 0.45 m@xmath10/yr with a metallicity , @xmath23 of 10 times solar .",
    "if all of the remaining sb / hism mass comes from evaporated clouds and swept up gas in the well - mixed ism with solar metallicity @xmath24 of 1 , then the averaged sb / hism metallicity , @xmath25/m_{hism}$ ] , or @xmath26 1 + 4(@xmath22/100myr ) .",
    "thus the sb / hism metallicity @xmath27 2 times solar for any sb / hism mean life , or mixing time , @xmath28 25 myr , consistent with the estimated values , e.g. mcwilliam ( 31 ) and thomas , greggio & bender ( 46 ) .    such a mixing time , or mean age , of metals from supernova ejecta in these superbubbles is more than a couple orders of magnitude longer than the minimum age ( @xmath6100 kyr ) of cosmic ray source metals required by the ace observations of wiedenbeck et al .",
    "( 53 ) , showing that the bulk of the @xmath0ni had decayed ( with a 110 kyr mean life ) in the cosmic ray source material prior to acceleration .    observational evidence of such supernova ejecta enriched superbubble metallicity may be found in the x - ray emission from the interiors of giant hii regions in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , thought to be superbubbles powered by supernovae .",
    "the observed x - ray luminosities of these bubbles , which should scale directly with metallicity , are an order of magnitude higher than would be expected ( chu & mac low ( 8) ) if they had a typical lmc metallicity of only 1/3 solar .",
    "thus , we suggest that the x - ray observations do in fact imply an average metallicity of roughly 3 times solar in these superbubbles .",
    "such metallicities are larger than that calculated from the simple analytic superbubble model of mac low & mccray ( 26 ) , which assumes conductive heating and evaporation of swept - up ism as the primary source of superbubble gas and predicts an averaged metallicity of only @xmath3 1.1 for a @xmath3 50 myr old superbubble of @xmath3 700 pc radius . but this model was based on several assumptions that greatly reduce the superbubble metallicity .",
    "first , the model neglected the interstellar magnetic fields that would greatly supress the conductive heating normal to the field lines , overestimating the ism input , and also provide additional external confining pressure , underestimating the supernova input required to generate the bubble , e.g. tomisaka ( 48 ) . in addition , the model assumed the unit density ism extended to heights much larger than the 700 pc bubble radius , instead of the measured scale height of @xmath6 200 pc , which would greatly reduce the assumed ism input , and moreover would allow the blow - out of the superbubble into the galactic halo , also greatly underestimating the supernova input required to generate the bubble . as a result of these underestimates of the required supernova power ,",
    "the model was able to generate a @xmath3 50 myr old superbubble of @xmath3 700 pc radius , with a very low effective rate of snii / ibc supernovae of only @xmath3 2 sn / myr kpc@xmath29 in the galactic plane .",
    "this assumed rate is only 3% of the estimated local snii / ibc rate @xmath3 70 sn / myr kpc@xmath29 ( as we show below ) , and thus the model underestimates the supernova ejecta input by a factor of 35 ! when an appropriate supernova rate is used and even minimal effects of the magnetic fields and gas scale height are considered , superbubble metallicities of more that 2 times solar would be expected .",
    "a large fraction of the c , o and refractory metals in this ejecta may be in graphite and oxide grains , since in the core - collapse supernova 1987a roughly 0.2 m@xmath10 of this material condensed out of the cooling , expanding ejecta as high velocity ( @xmath3 2500 km / s ) grains within 2 years after the explosion , see kozasa , hasegawa & nomoto ( 21 ) , and as much as 1 m@xmath10 could be expected , see dwek ( 9 ) , to condense before the ejecta is reheated and slowed by the reverse shock and the grains with a much smaller charge to mass ratio begin to move separately from the ejecta plasma .",
    "in fact , dwek ( 9,10 ) suggests that supernova ejecta are the major source of refractory grains in the galaxy and interactions with supernova shocks are the major cause of their destruction .",
    "thus , supernova ejecta and winds can be expected to dominate the metallicity and grains within the sb / hism , where the bulk of supernova shock waves are dissipated and the bulk of cosmic rays should be accelerated .",
    "these supernova grains should therefore be the major injection source required for the cosmic ray metals , because of their high initial velocity ( lingenfelter et al .",
    "( 25 ) ) and possible subsequent acceleration ( ellison et al . ( 11 ) ) .",
    "moreover , because the metallicity of the supernova ejecta is essentially independent of progenitor metallicity ( woosley & weaver ( 56 ) ) , the sb / hism can provide the essentially constant source of cosmic ray metals required by be / fe observations .",
    "therefore , we would expect that throughout the age of the galaxy , the bulk of the core - collapse supernovae occur in the metal enriched sb / hism , and the blast wave shocks of their remnants accelerate the bulk of the galactic cosmic rays out of the enriched gas and dust in the sb / hism .",
    "the hot ( @xmath30 k ) , tenuous ( @xmath18 h/@xmath19 ) phase of the interstellar medium is powered primarily by galactic supernovae and formed through the merger of superbubbles , generated by the clustered supernovae in ob associations .",
    "this can be seen energeticly from a comparison of the power required to maintain the pressure in the sb / hism and that provided by galactic supernovae , which suggests that the filling factor , i.e. the fractional volume , of the sb / hism should be large .",
    "the total energy in sb / hism is @xmath31 ergs , assuming a sb / hism filling factor , @xmath32 , a sb / hism pressure of @xmath33 erg/@xmath19 , a galactic radius of 15 kpc and a scale height of 3 kpc . for a sb / hism mean",
    "life @xmath22 of 100 myr , the power required to maintain the sb / hism is @xmath34 ergs / yr(@xmath22/100myr ) .",
    "the galactic snii / ibc rate of @xmath3 1 sn/40 yr with an average ejecta energy @xmath35 ergs / sn , gives a galactic snii / ibc power of @xmath36 ergs / yr . thus even with significant ( @xmath150% ) energy losses snii / ibc could completely fill ( @xmath32 = 1 ) the galaxy with the sb / hism in @xmath28 25 myr .",
    "the overall galactic average value of the filling factor of sb / hism is , in fact , generally taken to be @xmath3 50% , or more , depending on the assumed galactic scale height , e.g. yorke ( 57 ) , spitzer ( 45 ) , mckee ( 29 ) . because of the strong dependence of the sb / hism filling factor on local supernova rates , it is thought to be high @xmath3 90% in the inner galaxy ( i.e. within the solar radius of 8.5 kpc ) where most galactic supernovae occur , as well as in the galactic halo where the superbubbles blow - out , and low @xmath6 50% in the outer galaxy beyond the solar radius where few supernovae occur .    a more quatitative estimate of the dependence of the sb / hism filling factor on galactic radius ( see table  [ tab : a ] ) can be made from the radial dependence of the galactic supernova rate and the calculated filling factor versus the supernova rate .",
    ".radial dependence of galactic supernova rate & expected sb / hism filling factor [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the similarity of the cosmic ray source and solar abundance ratios of refractory elements , mainly mg , al , si , ca relative to fe , simply reflects the fact that supernovae are the primary source of these elements , e.g. timmes et al .",
    "( 47 ) , and that the sb / hism filling factor is large where cosmic rays are accelerated , so that the bulk of the fe grains from the snia also contribute to the high velocity grain population in the sb / hism . in particular , since the si , mg , al , and other refractory elements are primarily produced in core - collapse snii / ibc , while only about half of the fe is made in them and the other half is made in thermonuclear snia , a sb / hism filling factor of @xmath3 90% leads to differences of only @xmath3 5% between the si / fe ratio in sb / hism and the average galactic production ratio , which determines that in the well - mixed ism .",
    "this is well within the present uncertainties in the inferred cosmic ray source ratios shown in table 2 , where we see from a much more detailed estimate in lingenfelter & ramaty ( 24 ) that the injection abundances expected for cosmic ray acceleration predominantly in the sb / hism is consistent with the present cosmic ray source ratios of engelmann et al .",
    "( 13 ) even for an assumed sb / hism filling factor of only 50% .",
    "similar small differences @xmath6 10% in relative abundances from a sb / hism filling factor of @xmath3 90% would be expected for those s - process elements which appear to come primarily from the winds of less massive stars .",
    "the estimated mean refractory abundances in supernova grains ( table 2 ) are based on the calculations by woosley & weaver ( 56 ) , woosley , langer & weaver ( 55 ) and nomoto et al . ( 36 ) of supernova ejecta abundances for types ii , ib and ia , averaged over the initial mass function and supernova rates of van den berg & tammann ( 50 ) and van den bergh & mcclure ( 49 ) , except that we assume the grain o abundance is limited to that bound in al@xmath37o@xmath38 , mgsio@xmath38 , fe@xmath38o@xmath39 , cao and nio .",
    "we also show for comparison , the refractory abundances in the typical , older icy interstellar grains ( ismgrains ) and their refractory cores ( ismcores ) recently determined by hst observations , see savage & sembach ( 44 ) . here",
    "we see that the si / fe of 65% in refractory cores of ism grains , which meyer et al .",
    "( 33 ) proposed as the cosmic ray source , is not consistent with the required cosmic ray source value of 99@xmath152% .",
    "in addition to the sputtering of refractory ions , the interactions of the high velocity , supernova grains can also provide a simultaneous , self consistent cosmic ray injection source of h , he and other volatiles .",
    "cesarsky & bibring ( 7 ) suggested that high velocity grains may temporarily pick up by implantation volatile atoms from the gas through which they pass , and their subsequent sputtering could provide a source of less enriched suprathermal volatiles .",
    "we suggest a much more direct injection process for the volatiles .",
    "since direct collisions of fast grains with ambient gas atoms and ions are thought to be the primary means of grain momentum loss , e.g. ellison et al . ( 11 ) ",
    "2.3 , we would expect that the supernova grains should simply scatter ambient h , he and other volatile atoms to the same suprathermal injection velocities as the grains and their sputtered refractory products .",
    "such a process would , in fact , directly account for the measured cosmic ray abundance ratio by number of the refractory ( including c and  bound \" o ) to volatile elements , i.e. ( c , o , mg , al , si , fe , etc)/(h , he , etc ) = 0.010 of engelmann et al .",
    "( 13 ) , since ellison et al .",
    "( 11  2.4 ) assume that roughly 0.5%-1% of grain collisions with ambient gas atoms , predominantly scattering volatile atoms , result in the sputtering of a refractory atom from the grain surface , all of which come off with essentially the same injection velocity . moreover , because the geometric scattering cross section increases with mass to the 2/3 power , such scattering should also lead to a mass - dependent enrichment of heavier volatiles with respect to h , as is observed in the cosmic rays , e.g. meyer et al .",
    "( 33 ) , and which ellison & meyer ( 12 ) argue can not be accounted for by an a / z dependent acceleration bias in the hot ism .",
    "the composition of the grain - scattered suprathermal volatiles can be further enriched by the fact that most of the supernova shocks will be interacting with grains and gas in the supernova - ejecta and progenitor - wind enriched superbubbles . since the @xmath40ne/@xmath41ne ratio in the wolf rayet winds of massive , supernova progenitors may exceed the solar system value by more than two orders of magnitude , e.g. maeder & meynet ( 27 ) , grain - scattering of such wind enriched could account for the high @xmath40ne/@xmath41ne observed in the cosmic rays , e.g. leske et al .",
    "the existence of such a wolf rayet signature in the cosmic rays also provides further evidence for the acceleration of cosmic rays in the superbubble hot phase where the bulk of the massive wolf rayet , supernova progenitors are also confined ."
