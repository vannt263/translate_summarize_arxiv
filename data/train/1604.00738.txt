    "elliptic 3 surfaces have been the focus of much work in algebraic geometry and number theory over the last few decades .",
    "for such a surface over a field of characteristic  @xmath2 with at least one singular fiber , the rank of the mordell - weil group can be as large as  @xmath3 .",
    "cox @xcite proved in 1989 , using the surjectivity of the period map for 3 surfaces , that any integer between  @xmath2 and  @xmath3 actually occurs as the rank of the mordell - weil group of an elliptic 3 surface over @xmath4 .",
    "however , the proof uses transcendental methods , and does not lead to an algebraic construction of examples of elliptic 3 surfaces of a given rank .    in 2001",
    "kuwata constructed explicit examples of elliptic 3 surfaces over @xmath5 whose mordell - weil group over @xmath6 has rank  @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the proof uses inose s theorem ( see proposition  [ prop : inose ] ) , which relies on a transcendental argument . for this reason ,",
    "it was not clear how to find explicit generators of the mordell - weil group of such elliptic surfaces until our recent work @xcite , where we found a systematic method to describe a set of generators ( see also @xcite for earlier progress on this question ) . meanwhile , there have been constructions of elliptic 3 surfaces with mordell - weil rank  @xmath1 ( @xcite@xcite ) in order to fill the gap of  @xcite . however , these constructions are based on somewhat different ideas from that of @xcite , to which the method of @xcite does not seem to apply to find generators of the mordell - weil group .",
    "the goal of this article is to describe some new constructions of elliptic 3 surfaces with high mordell - weil rank using ideas closely related to the idea of @xcite .",
    "the construction of @xcite is based on the kummer surfaces @xmath10 associated with the product of two elliptic curves .",
    "for such a kummer surface shioda and inose @xcite constructed a double cover with certain properties ( now called a shioda - inose structure ) .",
    "we say that a 3 surface @xmath11 has a shioda - inose structure if @xmath11 admits an involution fixing the global @xmath0-form on @xmath11 , such that the quotient is a kummer surface @xmath12 , and provided that the rational quotient map @xmath13 induces a hodge isometry @xmath14 of ( scaled ) transcendental lattices .",
    "when @xmath15 is the product of two elliptic curves , @xmath11 was constructed in @xcite as an elliptic surface having two @xmath16 fibers .",
    "shioda and inose used this construction to prove a beautiful theorem establishing a one - to - one correspondence between singular 3 surfaces and even positive definite binary quadratic forms .",
    "later , inose @xcite constructed @xmath11 explicitly as a quartic surface in @xmath17 and as the quotient of a kummer surface by an involution .",
    "thus , we have a chain of rational maps @xmath18 , which we now call a `` kummer sandwich '' ( @xcite ) .",
    "the construction of @xmath19 in @xcite can be viewed as a base change of elliptic surfaces , and it is this fact that @xcite generalized to construct elliptic 3 surfaces of high rank .",
    "elliptic 3 surfaces of various mordell - weil ranks are constructed as a base change from @xmath11 , which we call the inose surface .",
    "our main idea in this article is to replace @xmath15 by the jacobian @xmath20 of a curve @xmath21 of genus  @xmath0 .",
    "we propose two different generalizations of inose s fibration on @xmath10 .",
    "a detailed study of shioda - inose structures on 3 surfaces was carried out by morrison @xcite . for kummer surfaces of principally polarized abelian surfaces ,",
    "double covers with shioda - inose structure were studied by naruki @xcite and dolgachev @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "kumar explicitly described these surfaces as a family of elliptic 3 surfaces with @xmath16 and @xmath22 fibers , whose weierstrass coefficients are related to invariants of the genus @xmath0 curve @xmath21 . in this construction ,",
    "the rational map @xmath23 in @xcite is a 2-isogeny between elliptic surfaces .",
    "the dual isogeny sets up the sandwich @xmath18 .",
    "our first construction is based on the observation that @xmath24 can also be described as an inose - style base change .",
    "more precisely , there is an elliptic fibration on the kummer surface ( fibration  13 in @xcite ) which can be obtained from the shioda - inose surface in @xcite as a base change by a simple change of variables . in  3 we give the details of this construction of elliptic 3 surfaces of various mordell - weil ranks .",
    "in particular , we give two numerical examples that have mordell - weil rank  @xmath1 .",
    "note that fibration  13 in @xcite has one @xmath25 fiber and one @xmath26 fiber , while inose s fibration on @xmath10 has two @xmath25 fibers .",
    "there does exist an elliptic fibration on @xmath27 with two @xmath25 fibers , and it can be constructed from known fibrations in @xcite using the `` 2-neighbor method '' of elkies .",
    "however , this fibration does not generically have a section .",
    "nevertheless , taking its jacobian fibration produces an elliptic fibration with section and the same fiber type .",
    "taking a base change , we can construct elliptic 3 surfaces with mordell - weil rank up to @xmath3 . in ",
    "4 we give details of this construction , and give a numerical example with mordell - weil rank  @xmath1 .    in future work",
    ", we hope to find explicit generators for the mordell - weil groups of the elliptic 3 surfaces constructed here , along the lines of @xcite .",
    "we thank matthias schtt and the referees for helpful comments on an earlier version of the paper .",
    "kumar was supported in part by nsf career grant dms-0952486 , and by a grant from the mit solomon buchsbaum research fund .",
    "kuwata was partially supported by jsps grant - in - aid for scientific research ( c ) no .  26400023 , and by the chuo university grant for special research .",
    "the computer algebra systems ` magma ` , ` sage ` , ` gp / pari ` , ` maxima ` and ` maple ` were used in the calculations for this paper .",
    "by an elliptic surface we mean a smooth projective surface  @xmath11 together with a relatively minimal elliptic fibration @xmath28 over a smooth projective curve @xmath21 , all defined over a field  @xmath29 , which we assume to be a number field throughout .",
    "we are interested in the case where @xmath11 is a 3 surface , @xmath21 is isomorphic to @xmath30 over @xmath29 , and @xmath31 admits a section @xmath32 also defined over @xmath29 . under these assumptions",
    "the generic fiber @xmath33 of @xmath31 is an elliptic curve defined over the rational function field @xmath34 .",
    "we also assume there is at least one singular fiber ( to ensure that the mordell - weil group is finitely generated ) .",
    "denote by @xmath35 the mordell - weil lattice @xmath36 .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for the theory of mordell - weil lattices and @xcite for a broader overview of elliptic surfaces .",
    "a theorem of shioda and tate connects the mordell - weil @xmath37 group with the picard group or the nron - severi group @xmath38 of @xmath33 ( note that linear equivalence and algebraic equivalence coincide ) .",
    "in particular , we have the shioda - tate formula ( cf .",
    "shioda@xcite ) @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the number of ( geometrically ) irreducible components of the fiber @xmath41 .",
    "we call  @xmath42 the ( geometric ) picard number .    in the absence of a section",
    "we would say that @xmath31 is a genus one fibration . sometimes in the literature",
    "these are called elliptic fibrations and those with section are labeled jacobian elliptic fibrations .    the following theorem of inose is essential to our construction .",
    "[ prop : inose ] let @xmath43 and @xmath44 be 3 surfaces defined over a number field @xmath29 and @xmath45 a rational map of finite degree .",
    "then @xmath43 and @xmath44 have the same picard number .",
    "inose proves this lemma for 3 surfaces over @xmath4 using a transcendental argument . since we know that @xmath46 , the conclusion is still valid for our case .    due to the transcendental nature of inose s proof",
    "we do not have a very good understanding of how the nron - severi lattices of @xmath43 and @xmath44 are related .",
    "thus , knowledge of an explicit set of divisors generating the picard group of @xmath47 , or of the mordell - weil group if @xmath47 is elliptically fibered , does not easily translate to the same for @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath11 be a kummer surface associated with an abelian surface  @xmath49 .",
    "then , @xmath50    let @xmath49 be a simple abelian surface . then , the picard number @xmath51 is given as follows .",
    "@xmath52    let @xmath49 be an abelian surface isogenous to the product of two elliptic curves @xmath53 . then ,",
    "the picard number @xmath54 is given as follows .",
    "let @xmath21 be a curve of genus  @xmath0 given by the equation @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a squarefree polynomial .",
    "in particular , we allow @xmath58 to be @xmath2 ( but in that case @xmath59 ) . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that a generic elliptic 3 surface with @xmath16 and @xmath22 fibers has a shioda - inose structure such that the quotient is the kummer surface of the jacobian of a genus @xmath0 curve .",
    "in fact , this correspondence sets up a birational map between the moduli space of such elliptic 3 surfaces and @xmath60 , the moduli space of genus @xmath0 curves .",
    "it can also be viewed as an isomorphism between the moduli space of 3 surfaces lattice polarized by @xmath61 and @xmath62 , the moduli space of principally polarized abelian surfaces . for a genus @xmath0 curve @xmath21",
    ", we can describe the unique associated elliptic 3 surface with @xmath16 and @xmath22 fibers as follows .",
    "let @xmath63 be the igusa - clebsch invariants ( see for example @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "then the corresponding 3 surface is given by the weierstrass equation @xmath64 it has a type @xmath16 fiber at @xmath65 and a type @xmath22 at @xmath66 .",
    "we say that @xmath21 is `` general '' if the other singular fibers are all @xmath67 .",
    "the surface defined by is isomorphic to @xmath68 which we call @xmath69 , and define the base change @xmath70 compare with the definition of @xmath71 in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "straightforward calculations show that the kodaira - nron model of @xmath72 is a 3 surface for @xmath73 .    in @xcite the map @xmath74",
    "is given as a @xmath0-isogeny between two elliptic surfaces .",
    "all jacobian elliptic fibrations ( elliptic fibrations with section ) on @xmath27 are classified in @xcite .",
    "fibration 13 in @xcite is @xmath75 which is isomorphic to @xmath76 by @xmath77 .",
    "thus , @xmath76 is isomorphic to @xmath27 , and we have a kummer sandwich diagram : @xmath78 .    the surface @xmath69 can be realized as a quartic surface just as inose s suface in @xcite : @xmath79 therefore we can regard @xmath69 as a generalization of inose s surface to the case of jacobian of the genus  @xmath0 curve  @xmath21 .",
    "this point of view was also studied in @xcite .",
    "[ thm : g^(n ) ] suppose @xmath21 is general .",
    "then the rank of the mordell - weil group @xmath80 is given by the table below .",
    "here , @xmath81 is the picard number of @xmath20 . @xmath82",
    "determination of the types of singular fibers is a straightforward application of tate s algorithm . by proposition  [ prop : inose ] , the picard number of each of the 3 surfaces @xmath83 is equal to that of @xmath27 , namely , @xmath84 .",
    "now , calculation of the rank is a straightforward application of the shioda - tate formula .    in order to obtain elliptic 3 surfaces",
    "whose mordell - weil rank  @xmath1 , it now suffices to find curves @xmath21 such that the picard number of its jacobian @xmath20 is  @xmath85 .",
    "we give two different examples below .",
    "as shown in @xcite , a set of five sections forms a basis of @xmath86 if @xmath87 .",
    "these sections are defined over the field @xmath88)$ ] .    in the case where the jacobian @xmath20 is simple , @xmath89 if and only if it has quaternionic multiplication .",
    "writing down an explicit equation of such a curve @xmath21 is a delicate number theoretical problem . here",
    ", we use an example of @xcite which depends on a result of hashimoto and tsunogai @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "take the curve in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma  4.5 ) and let @xmath90",
    ". then we obtain @xmath91 it has quaternionic multiplication by a maximal order in the quaternion algebra of discriminant @xmath92 , which is the smallest possible discriminant for a non - split quaternion algebra .",
    "calculating igusa - clebsh invariants , and simplifying the coefficients by a change of variables , we obtain the elliptic surface @xmath93 simple calculations show that the singular fibers are irreducible except at @xmath65 where it has a fiber of type @xmath94 .",
    "this shows that the rank of @xmath95 equals  @xmath1 .",
    "if we take the quadratic twist of @xmath96 by @xmath97 , the elliptic surface becomes simpler : @xmath98 however , it is possible that the field of definition of the mordell - weil group of the original surface may be easier to describe .",
    "as a second example , we consider the case where @xmath20 is isogenous to the product of two elliptic curves . since we want @xmath99 to be equal to  @xmath85 , we need to consider the case where @xmath100 with @xmath101 without complex multiplication .",
    "take two elliptic curves @xmath102 these both have rational @xmath92-torsion points , and are @xmath0-isogenous to each other .",
    "moreover , we have @xmath103\\simeq e_{2}[3]\\simeq{\\mathbb{z}}/3{\\mathbb{z}}\\times\\mu_{3}$ ] as galois modules .",
    "take the quadratic twist @xmath104 of @xmath105 by @xmath106 .",
    "then , the galois isomorphism @xmath103\\to e_{2}[3]$ ] isometric with respect to the weil pairing induces an anti - isometry @xmath103\\to e_{2}^{(-3)}[3]$ ] .",
    "therefore , by frey - kani @xcite , there exists a curve @xmath21 of genus  @xmath0 admitting morphisms @xmath107 and @xmath108 of degree  @xmath85 . to find an explicit equation , we use shaska s result @xcite . using the fact that @xmath109 and @xmath110 , we find that the curve @xmath21 corresponds to the values @xmath111 , @xmath112 in equation ( 8) in @xcite . after making some changes of variables ,",
    "we obtain the following weierstrass equation for @xmath21 : @xmath113 the maps @xmath114 and @xmath115 are given by @xmath116 where we have used the following weierstrass forms for @xmath117 and @xmath104 : @xmath118 the elliptic 3 surface @xmath72 corresponding to this @xmath21 is given by @xmath119 ( here , we have scaled @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 differently from the definition of @xmath72 to clear denominators . )",
    "it is readily verified that the singular fibers other than the @xmath94 fiber at @xmath65 are all irreducible .",
    "since @xmath117 and @xmath104 are isogenous over @xmath123 and do not have complex multiplication , the rank of @xmath95 is exactly  @xmath1 .",
    "the reader may wonder why we did not use a curve @xmath21 such that @xmath20 is @xmath124-isogenous to the product @xmath53 .",
    "the reason is that the resulting elliptic surface @xmath69 has at least one @xmath125 fiber other than @xmath126 and @xmath127 fibers .",
    "thus , the rank of @xmath95 can not be  @xmath1 .",
    "similarly , example  1 in @xcite yields @xmath69 with two @xmath125 fibers , and example  2 yields one with a @xmath128 fiber .",
    "a kummer surface @xmath27 can be realized as a complete intersection of three quadrics in @xmath130 .",
    "it contains two sets of sixteen lines intersecting each other as shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , figure  21 ) .",
    "classically , these sets are labeled _ nodes _ and _ tropes _ ; in the model of the kummer surface as a quartic surface in @xmath131 with sixteen singular points , the ( blown - down ) nodes are the singular points , while the tropes correspond to the sixteen planes tangent to the kummer surface along plane conics ( which are the transforms of the tropes ) .    as indicated in figure  1",
    ", we find a configuration of a pair of divisors of type @xmath129 .",
    "we thus have an elliptic fibration on @xmath27 having these two @xmath129 fibers .",
    "it turns out , however , that such an elliptic fibration does not have a section .",
    "thus , it is not in the list of elliptic fibrations studied in @xcite .        to obtain an explicit equation of this fibration",
    ", we start with fibration  1 in @xcite , two @xmath26 fibers and six @xmath135 fibers , with mordell - weil group @xmath136 . the zero section in @xcite",
    "is taken to be @xmath137 .",
    "however , we will take @xmath138 to be the zero section ; this does not affect the weierstrass equation , however changes the identity components of the reducible fibers , for instance .",
    "we can now take a @xmath0-neighbor step to the elliptic fibration corresponding to the fiber @xmath139 ( this fiber class is in the orbit of fibration @xmath140 of @xcite ) .",
    "we omit the details of the neighbor - step , apart from giving the elliptic parameter @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the equation of the section @xmath143 .",
    "the new elliptic fibration has weierstrass equation . @xmath144",
    "the fiber @xmath145 is at @xmath146 , while there is another fiber of type @xmath147 at @xmath148 , given by @xmath149 .",
    "there are also @xmath135 fibers at @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "the first is @xmath152 ( in the notation of fibration  @xmath153 of @xcite ) and the second has @xmath154 as a component .",
    "we can now move by another @xmath0-neighbor step to the elliptic fibration with @xmath155 as a fiber .",
    "the elliptic parameter is @xmath156 we omit the remaining details .",
    "the jacobian of this new fibration is given by @xmath157 where @xmath158 and @xmath159 it has @xmath25 fibers at @xmath160 and @xmath146 .        since @xmath166 is the jacobian of an elliptic fibration on @xmath27 ,",
    "there is a rational map @xmath167 of finite degree .",
    "thus , by proposition  [ prop : inose ] , the picard number of @xmath166 is equal to @xmath84 .",
    "the rest of the proof is similar to that of theorem  [ thm : g^(n ) ] .",
    "thus , @xmath168 for any simple abelian surface without extra endomorphisms gives an elliptic 3 surface of rank  @xmath1 .",
    "however , although a very general abelian surface ( in the moduli space of principally polarized abelian surfaces ) has this property , and we expect a `` random '' numerical example to have @xmath169 , we must verify it for any putative example explicitly . to do so , we first use leprvost s criterion ( * ? ? ?",
