    "infrared dark clouds ( hereafter , irdcs ) are discovered by the observations with iso ( infrared space observatory ) and msx ( midcourse space experiment ) @xcite , and observed as dark silhouettes against the background radiation of our galaxy in the mid infrared wavelength @xcite .",
    "they are massive ( @xmath7@xmath8 ) , dense ( @xmath9 ) , high column density ( @xmath10@xmath11 ) , and low temperature ( @xmath12  k ) @xcite .",
    "recently , irdcs have been known as the sites where massive star formation is active @xcite .",
    "various parameters , such as masses and luminosities , have been obtained from many observational studies from the mid - infrared to millimeter wavelengths ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these parameters depend on distance , and in most cases , kinematic distances have been used to derive the parameters assuming the rotational model of our galaxy",
    ". however , recent annual parallax measurements with vlbi show that kinematic distances tend to be overestimated and sometimes more than the double of those from parallaxes ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it is important to measure distances toward the sources accurately to know the physical condition of the sources .",
    "annual parallaxes of galactic sources located at a few kpc from the sun can be measured from the phase - referencing vlbi observations .",
    "phase - referencing vlbi is technique to observe two adjacent ( less than several degrees in the case of 22  ghz - band observations ) sources on the sky simultaneously or in the short time interval ( @xmath13  s at 22 ghz band ) @xcite . by subtracting the difference of optical path lengths between the the target and reference source , it becomes possible to eliminate the short - term fluctuations of the earth s atmosphere .",
    "in addition , the reference position is given by selecting an extragalactic source as the reference source .",
    "these benefits enable the astrometry referred to the reference source and , with the long - time integration , the detections of faint sources which is not able to detect with the normal vlbi observations .",
    "phase - referencing vlbi observations with vera ( vlbi exploration of radio astrometry ) and the vlba ( very large baseline array ) derive annual parallaxes of the kilo - parsec scale for the galactic maser sources ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) after the first successful measurements of annual parallaxes with @xmath0 masers by @xcite .",
    "it is possible to measure the annual parallaxes when both the maser sources and the adjacent extragalactic reference sources are bright and compact sufficient to observe with vlbi .    some irdcs emit masers such as the @xmath0 masers and @xmath14 masers @xcite , so we can measure the annual parallaxes from the phase - referencing vlbi observations of these masers .",
    "we used @xmath0 masers this time because most parallaxes measured with vera are based on the @xmath0 maser observations .",
    "@xcite surveyed @xmath0 masers for irdcs and found that msxdc g034.43@xmath100.24 has bright @xmath0 masers",
    ". there is also an extragalactic source as a reference source for phase - referencing within @xmath15 from msxdc g034.43@xmath100.24 @xcite .",

    "mm1 , mm3 and mm4 have 4.5  excesses , which suggest the existence of the ionized or shocked gas .",
    "point sources seen at 24  and associated with all four millimeter cores suggest the existence of the warm dust @xcite .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite calculated the mass of each millimeter core .",

    "the measurements of the annual parallax of msxdc g034.43@xmath100.24 require a special care because this source has a low - declination of @xmath50 .",

    "but they draw almost straight lines in the right - ascension direction for low - declination sources .",
    "thus the positional accuracy in the declination direction decreases especially in the case of the small number of stations , that is , small numbers of baselines and observing points in the declination direction . in our parallax measurement , we used only the right - ascension components in order to avoid this effect .",
