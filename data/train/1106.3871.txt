    "two types of experimental methods can be used to detect neutrino oscillations : observing the appearance of a neutrino flavour initially absent in the beam or measuring the disappearance rate of the initial flavour . in the latter case , one must know the flux of the beam precisely . in this type of experiment one",
    "explores whether less than the expected number of neutrinos of a produced flavour arrives at a detector or whether the spectral shape changes if observed at various distances from a source .",
    "since the final state is not observed , disappearance experiments can not tell into which flavor a neutrino has oscillated .",
    "an appearance experiment searches for possible new flavours of neutrino , which does not exist in the original beam , or for an enhancement of an existing neutrino flavour .",
    "the identification of the flavour relies on the detection of the corresponding lepton produced in its charged current ( cc ) interactions : @xmath5 with @xmath6 and where x denotes the hadronic final state .    in the past two decades ,",
    "several experiments carried out with atmospheric and accelerator neutrinos , as well as with solar and reactor neutrinos , have established the picture of a three - neutrino oscillation scenario with two large mixing angles .",
    "atmospheric sector flavor conversion was first established by the super - kamiokande  @xcite and macro  @xcite experiments and then confirmed by the k2k  @xcite and minos  @xcite longbaseline experiments .",
    "the chooz  @xcite and palo verde  @xcite reactor experiments excluded indirectly the @xmath7 channel as the dominant process in the atmospheric sector .",
    "however , the direct observation of flavour transition through the detection of the corresponding lepton has never been observed .",
    "appearance of @xmath4 will prove unambiguously that @xmath8 oscillation is the dominant transition channel at the atmospheric scale .",
    "the opera experiment  @xcite has been designed to directly observe the appearance of @xmath4 in a pure @xmath3 beam on an event by event basis .",
    "the @xmath4 signature is given by the decay topology and kinematics of the short lived @xmath9 leptons produced in the interaction of @xmath10 and decaying to one prong ( @xmath11 or @xmath12 ) or three prongs , which are  @xcite : @xmath13",
    "the cngs @xmath3 beam produced by the cern - sps is directed towards the opera detector , located in the gran sasso underground laboratory ( lngs )  @xcite in italy , 730 km away from the neutrino source at cern . in order to study @xmath14 oscillations in appearance mode",
    "as indicated in the atmospheric neutrino sector , the cern neutrinos to gransasso ( cngs ) neutrino beam  @xcite was designed and optimized by maximizing the number of @xmath4cc interactions at the lngs .",
    "the average @xmath3 beam energy is 17 @xmath15 , well above tau production energy treshold .",
    "the @xmath16 contamination is @xmath17 in flux , @xmath18 in terms of interactions .",
    "the @xmath19 and @xmath20 contaminations are lower than @xmath21 , while the number of prompt @xmath4 from @xmath22 decay is negligible .",
    "the average @xmath23 ratio is 43 @xmath24 , suitable for oscillation studies at atmospheric @xmath25 . due to the earth s curvature neutrinos from cern",
    "enter the lngs halls with an angle of about @xmath26 with respect to the horizontal plane .    with a nominal cngs beam intensity of @xmath27 protons on target ( @xmath2 ) per year , and assuming @xmath28 and full mixing , about 10 @xmath4 events are expected to be observed in opera in 5 years of data taking , with selection criteria reducing the background to 0.75 events .",
    "the goal is to accumulate a statistics of neutrino interactions correspomding to @xmath29 @xmath2 in 5 years .",
    "the 2008 , 2009 and 2010 runs achieved a total intensity of @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xmath2 respectively . within these three years , neutrinos produced 9637 beam events .",
    "the processing of these events , particularly the scanning of emulsion films , is continuously going on .",
    "the 2011 run started on may 2011 and is still in progress .",
    "at the cngs energies the average @xmath9 decay length is submillimetric , so opera uses nuclear emulsion films as high precision tracking device in order to be able to detect such short decays .",
    "emulsion films are interspaced with @xmath33 thick lead plates , which act as neutrino target and form the largest part of the detector mass",
    ". this technique is called emulsion cloud chamber ( ecc ) .",
    "it was successfully used to establish the first evidence for charm in cosmic rays interactions  @xcite and in the donut experiment  @xcite for the first direct observation of the @xmath4 .",
    "to date , nine @xmath4 cc interactions have been observed by donut produced by a fixed target 800 @xmath15 proton beam configuration .",
    "opera is a hybrid detector made of two identical super modules ( sm1 and sm2 ) , each one formed by a target section and a muon spectrometer as shown in figure  [ fig : detector ] .",
    "each target section is organized in 31 vertical `` @xmath34 '' , transverse to the beam direction .",
    "walls are filled with `` @xmath35 @xmath36 '' with an overall mass of 1.25 @xmath37 .",
    "they are followed by double layers of scintillator planes acting as target trackers ( tt ) that are used to locate neutrino interactions occurred within the target .",
    "a target brick consists of 56 lead plates of 1 mm thickness interleaved with 57 emulsion films .",
    "the lead plates serve as neutrino interaction target and the emulsion films as 3-dimensional tracking detectors providing track coordinates with a sub - micron accuracy and track angles with a few mrad accuracy .",
    "the material of a brick along the beam direction corresponds to about 10 radiation length and 0.33 interaction length .",
    "the brick size is @xmath38 and its weight is about @xmath39 .        in order to reduce the emulsion scanning load , changeable sheets ( cs )",
    "@xcite film interfaces have been used .",
    "they consist in tightly packed doublets of emulsion films glued to the downstream face of each brick .",
    "charged particles from a neutrino interaction in a brick cross the cs and produce signals in the tt that allow the corresponding brick to be identified and extracted by an automated brick manipulator system ( bms ) .",
    "the spectrometers consist of a dipolar magnet instrumented with active detectors , planes of rpcs ( internal tracker , it ) and drift tubes ( precision tracker , pt ) .",
    "tasks of the spectrometers are muon identification and charge measurement in order to minimize the background . for muon momenta between 2.5 @xmath40 and 45 @xmath40 ,",
    "the fraction of events with wrong charge determination is @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath42 to @xmath43 events ratio , within the selected momentum range , obtained from data can be directly compared with predictions based on monte carlo simulations : @xmath44 for data , @xmath45 for mc .",

    "the agreement between data and mc simulation is reasonable .",
    "the sum of the qe and res processes can be clearly seen as a peak at low y values .",
    "the nc contribution shows up at values of bjorken - y close to one .",
    "the nc contribution becomes negligible when a track with its momentum measured by the spectrometer is required .",
    "a detailed description of the complete detector can be found in  @xcite .",
    "event reconstruction procedures and a performances of the opera electronic detectors can be found in more detail in  @xcite .",
    "neutrino event analysis starts with the pattern recognition in the electronic detectors . charged particle tracks produced in a neutrino interaction",
    "generate signals in the tt and in the muon spectrometer .",
    "a brick finding algorithm is applied in order to select the brick which has the maximum probability to contain the neutrino interaction .",
    "the brick with the highest probability is extracted from the detector for analysis .",
    "the efficiency of this procedure reaches @xmath46 in a subsample where up to 4 bricks per event were processed .",
    "after extraction of the brick predicted by the electronic detectors , its validation comes from the analysis of the cs films .",
    "the measurement of emulsion films is performed through high - speed automated microscopes  @xcite with a sub - micrometric position resolution and angular resolution of the order of one milliradian . if no expected charged track related to the event is found in the cs , the brick is returned back to the detector with another cs doublet attached . if any track originating from the interaction is detected in the cs , the brick is exposed to cosmic rays ( for alignment purposes ) and then depacked .",
    "the emulsion films are developed and sent to the scanning laboratories of the collaboration for event location studies and decay search analysis .",
    "all the track information of the cs is then used for a precise prediction of the tracks in the most downstream films of the brick ( with an accuracy of about @xmath47 ) . when found in this films ,",
    "tracks are followed upstream from film to film .",
    "the scan - back procedure is stopped when no track candidate is found in three consecutive films and the lead plate just upstream the last detected track segment is defined as the vertex plate . in order to study the located vertices and reconstruct the events , a general scanning volume is defined with a transverse area of @xmath48 for 5 films upstream and 10 films downstream of the stopping point . all track segments in this volume are collected and analysed .",
    "after rejection of the passing through tracks related to cosmic rays and of the tracks due to low energy particles , the tracks produced by the neutrino interaction can be selected and reconstructed .",
    "the present overall location efficiency averaged over nc and cc events , from the electronic detector predictions down to the vertex confirmation , is about @xmath49 .",
    "once the neutrino interaction is located , a decay search procedure is applied to detect possible decay or interaction topologies on tracks attached to the primary vertex .",
    "the main signature of a secondary vertex ( decay or nuclear inetaraction ) is the observation of a track with a significant impact parameter ( ip ) relative to the neutrino interaction vertex .",
    "the ip of primary tracks is smaller than 10@xmath50 after excluding tracks produced by low momentum particles .",
    "when secondary vertices are found in the event , a kinematical analysis is performed , using particle angles and momenta measured in the emulsion films . for charged particles up to about 6 @xmath40 , momenta can be determined using the angular deviations produced by multiple coulomb scattering ( mcs ) of tracks in the lead plates  @xcite with a resolution better than @xmath51 . for higher momentum particles ,",
    "the measurement is based on the position deviations .",
    "the resolution is better than @xmath52 on 1/p up to 12 @xmath40 for particles passing through an entire brick .",
    "a @xmath53-ray search is performed in the whole scanned volume by checking all tracks having an ip with respect to the primary or secondary vertices lower than 800@xmath50 .",
    "the angular acceptance is @xmath54 @xmath55 .",
    "the @xmath53-ray energy is estimated by a neural network algorithm that uses the number of segments , the shape of the electromagnetic shower and also the mcs of the leading tracks .",
    "in the following , the analysis results  @xcite of about @xmath56 of the 2008 and 2009 data sample , corresponding to the @xmath57 @xmath58 are presented . the decay search procedure was applied to a sample of 1088 events of which 901 were classified as cc interactions . in the sample of cc interactions ,",
    "20 charm decay candidates were observed , in good agreement with the expectations from the monte carlo simulation , @xmath59 . out of them 3 have a 1-prong topology where @xmath60 was expected .",
    "the background for the total charm sample is about 2 events .",
    "several @xmath19-induced events have also been observed .",
    "moreover , a first cc @xmath4 candidate has been detected .",
    "the expected number of @xmath4 events detected in the analysed sample is about @xmath61 at @xmath62 @xmath63 and full mixing .",
    "in this section , the first tau neutrino candidate  @xcite will be described .",
    "the location and decay search procedure yielded a neutrino interaction vertex with 7 tracks .",
    "one track exhibits a visible kink with an angular change of @xmath64 after a path length of @xmath65 .",
    "the kink daughter momentum is estimated to be @xmath66 @xmath40 by mcs measurement and its transverse momentum to the parent direction is @xmath67 @xmath68 .",

    "candidate event.,title=\"fig : \" ]   candidate event.,title=\"fig : \" ]     candidate event . ]",
    "all the tracks from the neutrino interaction vertex were followed until they stop or interact .",
    "the probability that one of them is left by a muon is estimated to be less than @xmath69 .",
    "the residual probability for being a @xmath3cc event , with a possibly undetected large angle @xmath70 track , is about @xmath21 ; a nominal value of @xmath71 is assumed .",
    "none of the tracks is compatible with being an electron .",
    "two electromagnetic showers caused by @xmath53-rays , associated with the event , have been located and studied . the energy of @xmath72 is @xmath73 @xmath15 and it is clearly pointing to the decay vertex .",
    "the @xmath74 has an energy of @xmath75 @xmath15 and it is compatible with pointing to either vertex , with a significantly larger probability to the decay vertex .",
    "all the selection cuts used in the analysis were those described in detail in the experiment proposal  @xcite and its addendum  @xcite .",
    "all the kinematical variables of the event and the cut applied are given in table  [ tab : kinematic ] .",

    "the two main sources of background to the @xmath83 channel where a similar final state may be produced are :    * the decays of charmed particles produced in @xmath3 cc interactions where the primary muon is not identified as well as the @xmath84 pair production in @xmath3 nc interactions where one charm particle is not identified and the other decays to a 1-prong hadron channel ; * the 1-prong inelastic interactions of primary hadrons produced in @xmath3cc interactions where the primary muon is not identified or in @xmath3 nc interactions and in which no nuclear fragment can be associated with the secondary interaction .",
