    "their usefulness for characterization of the burst and spike synchronization transitions in the frequency domain has been shown in explicit examples of bursting hr neurons by varying the noise intensity @xmath38 .",
    "population synchronization may be well visualized in the raster plot of neural spikes which may be obtained in experiments .",
    "the ipfr kernel estimate @xmath0 , which is obtained from the raster plot of spikes , is a realistic collective quantity describing the whole combined population behaviors with the slow bursting and the fast spiking timescales . through frequency filtering",
    ", we have decomposed the ipfr kernel estimate @xmath0 into the ipbr @xmath1 and the ipsr @xmath2 .",
    "we note that both @xmath1 and @xmath2 may be used to effectively characterize the burst and spike synchronizations , respectively . for synchronous cases ,",
    "oscillations of @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the time domain are characterized by the bursting and spiking peaks in their power spectral densities .",

    "these frequency - domain order parameters @xmath130 and @xmath131 yield the same bursting noise threshold @xmath96 which is obtained via calculation of @xmath109 , and they are more direct ones than @xmath109 because they may be directly obtained without frequency filtering . we also note that all these bursting and spiking noise thresholds are the same as those obtained through calculations of the time - domain bursting and spiking order parameters @xcite . consequently , the frequency - domain bursting and spiking order parameters may be usefully used for characterizing the burst and spike synchronization transitions of the bursting neurons , as in the case of the time - domain bursting and spiking order parameters .",
