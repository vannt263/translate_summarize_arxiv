    "the natural time scales near neutron stars ( nss ) and stellar mass black holes ( bhs ) are in the millisecond range .",
    "these time scales characterize the fundamental physical properties of compact objects : mass , radius , and angular momentum . for example , the maximum spin rate of a ns is set by the equation of state of the ultradense matter in its interior , a fundamental property of matter that still eludes us .",
    "similarly , orbital periods at a given radius near a bh are set by the bh s mass , angular momentum , and the laws of relativistic gravity .",
    "although it was recognized for decades that the measurement of such time scales would provide unique insight into these compact stars and their extreme physics , it was not until the 1995 launch of the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ; @xcite ) that oscillations on these time scales were actually detected from accreting nss and stellar - mass bhs .",
    "this conference celebrates rxte s discovery of millisecond oscillations that trace the spin rate of accreting nss .",
    "rxte has also discovered millisecond oscillations from accreting bhs with frequencies that scale inversely with bh mass and are consistent with the orbital time scale of matter moving in the strongly curved spacetime near the bh event horizon .",
    "while rxte revealed the existence of these phenomena , it lacks the sensitivity to fully exploit them in determining the fundamental properties of nss and bhs . here , we describe the advanced x - ray timing array ( axtar ) , a new mission concept boasting an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity over rxte .",
    "axtar was initially proposed as a medium - class probe concept for nasa s 2007 astrophysics strategic mission concept studies .",
    "a modified version of axtar is also being studied as a nasa midex - class mission concept .",
    ".selected axtar science topics [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "axtar will study a broad range of topics in the astrophysics of nss and bhs as well as the physics of ultradense matter , strongly curved spacetime , and intense magnetic fields ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the mission design was driven by the requirements for three key efforts :    * neutron star radii and the equation of state of ultradense matter . * axtar will make the first precise measurements of ns radii , using pulse profile fitting of millisecond brightness oscillations near the onset of thermonuclear x - ray bursts .",
    "gravitational self - lensing by the ns suppresses the amplitude of observed oscillations by allowing an observer to `` see '' more than just the facing hemisphere , an effect set by the ratio of mass to radius , @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "additionally , the pulse shape of the oscillations is influenced by the ns rotational velocity , @xmath3 , where the ns spin frequency @xmath4 is known from the oscillations @xcite .",
    "the pulsed surface emission encodes information about the ns structure , and modeling of high signal - to - noise profiles can be used to constrain @xmath5 and @xmath6 separately @xcite .",
    "precise measurement of ns radii at the 5% level is the key to determining the equation of state of ultradense matter @xcite , one of the most fundamental questions arising at the interface of physics and astrophysics .",
    "* black hole oscillations and the physics of extreme gravity . * axtar will determine if high - frequency oscillations from bhs are a direct tracer of mass and spin .",
    "in several systems , rxte has detected high - frequency qpo pairs whose properties suggest such a relationship @xcite . by extending the detection threshold down a 20@xmath1 to @xmath70.05% amplitude , axtar will test this prospect in two ways : ( 1 ) by detecting additional examples of rapid qpo pairs in other bhs to test the @xmath8 scaling of the observed frequencies with a larger source sample ; and ( 2 ) by detecting additional weaker qpo modes in the existing systems , as predicted by models for the bh oscillations [ see , e.g. , 13 - 17 ] .",
    "* continuous long - term monitoring of the variable x - ray sky . *",
    "the axtar sky monitor will _ continuously _ monitor hundreds of x - ray sources in addition to serving as a trigger for target - of - opportunity observations of active x - ray transients .",
    "a sensitive sky monitor with nearly continuous all - sky coverage can serve as a _ primary _ science instrument for a wide variety of investigations using an all - sky sample , including : daily flux and spin monitoring of accretion - powered pulsars , phase - coherent tracking of the spin - down of magnetars and detection of glitches , long - term monitoring of bright agns , superbursts , x - ray flashes , etc .",
    "the axtar mission concept assumes a 3-axis stabilized spacecraft in low - earth orbit .",
    "a notional illustration of the spacecraft layout is shown in figure  1a , and the mission parameters are summarized in table  2 . like rxte",
    ", axtar is optimized for study of x - ray transients anywhere in the sky by combining a small solar avoidance angle with the ability to repoint promptly ( @xmath91  d ) to targets of opportunity ( toos ) .",

    "pixelated solid - state detectors constructed out of large si wafers promise better performance , higher reliability , and lower cost than gas proportional counters ; they also leverage massive industrial investment in integrated circuit technology .",
    "lata consists of 1000 of the largest detectors that can be made from a single 150  mm diameter si wafer , coupled with electronics optimized for extremely low noise and low power . the effective area curve for axtar - lata",
    "is compared to several other missions in figure  1b .",
    "an improvement of over an order of magnitude over rxte is achieved .",
    "the axtar sky monitor ( sm ) comprises a set of 32 modest - size coded aperture cameras , each consisting of a 2d - pixelated si detector ( essentially identical to those used in the lata ) with 300  cm@xmath0 area and 225  kev coverage .",
    "each detector will view the sky through a 2-d coded mask and will have a @xmath15 ( fwhm ) field of view .",
    "the cameras will be mounted with pointing directions chosen to cover 4@xmath11 sr .",
    "the axtar - sm will be able to monitor most celestial locations with a 60100% duty cycle ( depending on final orbit choice ) , as compared to the @xmath73% duty cycle of rxte / asm .",
    "it will also have timing capability as well as a 1-day sensitivity of a few mcrab ( 20@xmath1 better than rxte / asm ) .",
    "this will allow early detection ( and too triggering ) of much fainter transients as well as enabling the continuous monitoring and timing programs mentioned above ."
