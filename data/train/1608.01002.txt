    "in quantum field theory , the interaction between a scalar field and an observer is often studied by modelling the observer by a spatially pointlike system with discrete energy levels , an unruh - dewitt detector  @xcite . despite its mathematical simplicity",
    ", this modelling captures the core features of the dipole interaction by which atomic orbitals couple to the electromagnetic field  @xcite . in the special case of a uniformly linearly accelerated observer coupled to a field in its minkowski vacuum , detector analyses have provided significant evidence that the unruh effect  @xcite , the thermal response of the observer , occurs whenever the interaction time is long , the interaction switch - on and switch - off are sufficiently slow and the back - reaction of the observer on the quantum field remains small @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider an unruh - dewitt detector coupled to a dirac field , taking the interaction hamiltonian to be linear in the dirac field s scalar density , @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the product of @xmath5 and @xmath6 at the same spacetime point makes this interaction more singular than the conventional linear coupling to a scalar field  @xcite . working in linear perturbation theory for a massive dirac field",
    ", the detector s response has a divergent additive term , and although in stationary situations this term been viewed as a formally divergent constant that should be dropped in the dual limit of long interaction and small coupling  @xcite , in nonstationary situations the response would need an additional regularisation , perhaps by a spatial profile or by an appropriate normal ordering  @xcite . in the special case of minkowski vacuum ,",
    "the divergent term is however proportional to the mass of the field , and for a massless field a consistent regularisation is accomplished by simply dropping the additive term  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we therefore focus on the massless field .",
    "our first objective is to evaluate the detector s response on an arbitrary trajectory in minkowski spacetime of dimension @xmath0 when the field is initially prepared in minkowski vacuum , working in linear perturbation theory and allowing the detector to be switched on and off in an arbitrary smooth way .",
    "we show that the response is identical to that of a detector coupled linearly to a massless scalar field in @xmath2 spacetime dimensions . in the special case of uniform linear acceleration , the long time limit of the detector s response",
    "hence exhibits the unruh effect with a planckian factor for all  @xmath1 .",
    "by contrast , the rindler power spectrum of the dirac field is known to have a planckian factor for odd @xmath1 but a fermi - dirac factor for even  @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "these observations are compatible since the detector s response is not equal to the rindler power spectrum but is given by the convolution of the rindler power spectrum with itself  @xcite .",
    "our second objective is to consider a detector on an arbitrary worldline on a @xmath7-dimensional flat static cylinder .",
    "the main issue here is that the field has two spin structures , often referred to as the periodic field and the antiperiodic field , and while the antiperiodic field has a minkowski - like fock vacuum , the zero mode of the periodic field does not have a fock vacuum .",
    "we evaluate the detector s response , showing that the response distinguishes the periodic and antiperiodic spin structures , and the zero mode of the periodic spinor contributes to the response by a state - dependent but well defined way .",
    "we also give a selection of analytic and numerical results for inertial and uniformly accelerated trajectories , recovering the @xmath3 minkowski results in the limit of large circumference .    in two dimensions ,",
    "our results show that the detector s response has no infrared ambiguity , neither in minkowski nor on the cylinder . in this respect",
    "the massless dirac field differs from the massless scalar field , whose response in two - dimensional minkowski vacuum is ambiguous due to the additive ambiguity in the wightman function  @xcite .",
    "we begin by recalling in section [ sec : udw - detector ] the definition of the field - detector model with an interaction hamiltonian that is linear in the dirac field s scalar density .",
    "the response in minkowski vacuum in @xmath0 dimensions is evaluated in section [ sec : mink - vac ] and the response on the @xmath7-dimensional flat static cylinder in section  [ sec : cylinder ] .",

    "the detector is a two - level system , with the hilbert space  @xmath13 , spanned by the orthonormal basis @xmath14 of eigenstates of the hamiltonian  @xmath15 : @xmath16 , where the eigenenergies @xmath17 and @xmath18 are real - valued constants .",

    "we assume @xmath23 either to have compact support or to have so rapid falloff that the system can be treated as uncoupled in the asymptotic past and future .",
    "before the interaction begins , the detector occupies the eigenstate @xmath24 and the field occupies some hadamard state  @xmath25 . working to linear order in  @xmath22 ,",
    "the probability for the detector to be found in the state @xmath26 after the interaction has ceased , regardless the final state of the field , is @xmath27 where @xmath28 , the detector s response function @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 and @xmath31 the factor @xmath32 depends only on the inner working of the detector , and we drop it from now on , referring to the response function as the probability .",

    "this is fully compatible with our observation that the detector s response involves a planck factor in all spacetime dimensions : the response function is not directly the rindler noise but rather the self - convolution of the rindler noise , as shown in ( 8.5.13 ) in  @xcite , and a fermi - dirac factor in the rindler noise does not imply a fermi - dirac factor in the response function .",
