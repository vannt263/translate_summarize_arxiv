    "the same procedure can be applied by analogy to a new lf as given by the mass - luminosity relationship , see equations  ( [ hzero3 ] ) and ( [ hzero4 ] )",

    "the developed framework also enables the deduction of the reference magnitude of the sun , see formula  ( [ msun ] ) and the application to the 2dfgrs gives @xmath61    assuming that the exact value is @xmath62 = 5.33 , the efficiency in deriving the reference magnitude of the sun is @xmath63 when @xmath57 .",
    "we briefly review the basic cosmological assumptions adopted here to derive the hubble constant :    * the mechanism that produces the redshift , here extracted from the catalog of galaxies , is not specified but we remember that the plasma redshift and det ( dispersive estinction theory ) do not produce a geocentric model for the universe as given by the doppler shift , see @xcite . * the number of galaxies as a function of redshift as well as the averaged redshift are evaluated in a euclidean space or , in other words , the effects of space - curvature are ignored . * the spatial inhomogeneities present in the catalog of galaxies",
    "are partially neutralized by the operation of adding together the data of the south and north galactic pole of the 2dfgrs .",
    "the transition from a nonhomogeneous to a quasi - homogeneous universe is clear when figure  [ isto1 ] and figure  [ isto2 ] are carefully analyzed . *",
    "the initial assumptions of : ( i ) natural flux decreasing as given by equation  ( [ flr2 ] ) ; ( ii ) linear relationship between redshift and distance which are present in the joint distribution in _ z _ and _ f _ for the number of galaxies are justified by the acceptable results obtained for the theoretical maximum in the number of galaxies , see figure  [ zeta_max_flux ] .",
    "this fact allow us to speak of a euclidean universe up to @xmath64 . *",
    "the presence of the malmquist bias does not allow to extrapolate the concept of a euclidean , static universe for distances greater than @xmath65 when the 2dfgrs catalog is considered .",
    "i would like to thank the smithsonian astrophysical observatory and john huchra for the public file http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/  huchra / hubble.plot.dat which contains the published values of the hubble constant ."
