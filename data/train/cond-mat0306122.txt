    "within the semiclassical model , charge carrier transport in semiconductor structures is commonly described in two limiting situations . in the ballistic limit ( carrier mean free path much larger than the characteristic dimensions of the sample ) , the carriers move unscattered all through the sample . the conduction is treated as transmission across the band edge profile of carriers emitted and absorbed at external contacts which are represented by large reservoirs in thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "this is the picture of ballistic motion thermally activated at the contacts in terms of which one derives a current - voltage characteristic for the current flowing in the sample . in the other , the diffusive , limit ( mean free path much smaller than the characteristic dimensions of the sample ) , one has the drude model of carriers moving from one equilibrium state to another , infinitesimally close - lying one , each characterized by the local quasi - fermi level and by the electric field provided by the band edge potential @xcite .",
    "this yields the local drift - diffusion equations for the current density in the sample .    in the present work",
    ", we consider the general case where the ratio between mean free path and the characteristic dimensions of the sample may assume any given value . for definiteness",
    ", we treat electron transport ; the case of holes is analogous .",
    "we develop a unified description of ballistic and diffusive electron transport in parallel - plane semiconductor structures , in which the ballistic motion is thermally activated neither only at the distant external contacts nor only at infinitesimally close - lying points , but at separations anywhere between these two limits .",
    "no restrictions are imposed on the shape of the conduction band edge profile .",
    "the unified description relies on the introduction of a `` thermo - ballistic current '' , where the electrons move ballistically in the band edge potential over the length of certain randomly distributed `` ballistic intervals '' , at the ends of which they are thermalized .",
    "the probability for ballistic ( unscattered ) motion between any two end points ( `` points of equilibration '' ) is governed by the mean free path .",
    "the thermalization is effected by the coupling of the electron motion to the background of impurity atoms and electrons in equilibrium .",
    "the equilibration at the end points of the ballistic intervals , i.e. , at the points separating adjacent intervals , is viewed as absorption of the electrons impinging from either side , and re - emission with a momentum distribution determined by the local quasi - fermi level of the background .",
    "the absorbed and re - emitted currents do not , in general , counter - balance , and produce a background current whose local increment is equal to the negative of the increment of the thermo - ballistic current .",
    "therefore , the sum of the thermo - ballistic and background currents is conserved , and is to be identified with the physical current . from the condition that the integral of the background current over the length of the sample vanishes , an integral equation is derived for the quasi - fermi level inside the sample in terms of a `` resistance function ''",
    "@xmath0 , which yields the thermo - ballistic current and whose value @xmath1 at one end of the sample determines the current - voltage characteristic .",
    "this quantity depends on the mean free path @xmath2 and on the shape of the conduction band edge profile @xmath3 , @xmath4)$ ] , and is called the `` reduced resistance '' .",
    "it is the central quantity of the unified description of ballistic and diffusive electron transport .",
    "the derivation is carried out for the nondegenerate case ; it turns out that essentially the same reduced resistance determines the zero - bias conductance in the degenerate case .    in earlier papers @xcite",
    ", attempts have been made to treat the synthesis of ballistic and diffusive transport for particular band edge profiles . a heuristic unified model yielding a closed expression for the reduced resistance in terms of the shape of an _ arbitrary _ band edge profile has been presented in ref .  @xcite . the present work is directed towards a comprehensive description of electron transport , with emphasis on a consistent theoretical formulation .",
    "no attempt is made here to apply our approach in the analysis of experimental data .    in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the two basic elements of our description , the points of local equilibration and the ballistic intervals , and derive the probabilities of occurrence of the latter . in sec .",

    "iv , the integral equation for the function @xmath0 is derived and the current - voltage characteristic is expressed in terms of the reduced resistance @xmath1 .",
    "the ballistic and diffusive limits are obtained as special cases .",

    "simple examples illustrating our formalism are considered in sec .",
    "v. we examine various types of conduction band edge profile :  flat profile ( constant electrostatic potential ) , profiles rising ( or falling ) monotonically , and profiles containing a single maximum .",
    "we present calculations of the reduced resistance @xmath1 , of the quasi - fermi level , and of the thermo - ballistic current for one - dimensional and three - dimensional transport . in sec .",

    "we have developed a unified semiclassical description of ballistic and diffusive carrier transport in parallel - plane semiconductor structures . a novel theoretical formulation has been achieved by introducing the concept of a thermo - ballistic current , which combines in a consistent manner the ballistic motion of carriers in the band edge potential and their thermalization at randomly distributed equilibration points .",
    "global conservation of the thermo - ballistic current has been established by identifying its average over the sample length with the physical current , for which the current - voltage characteristic has been derived in terms of a reduced resistance .",
    "the formalism is applicable to the treatment of transport across arbitrarily shaped band edge profiles .",
    "calculations of the reduced resistance have been carried out for simple band edge profiles .",
    "it has been found that generally the transport mechanism changes smoothly from ballistic to diffusive as the value of the ratio of mean free path and sample length changes from large to small .",
    "the introduction of a pronounced profile structure appears to weaken the dependence on this ratio .",
    "the dimensionality of the electron motion turns out to have fairly small effect , giving rise to a value of no more than 3/2 for the ratio of the reduced resistances for three - dimensional and one - dimensional transport . by using , in one - dimensional calculations ,",
    "the effective mean free path of the three - dimensional case , one may closely approximate the results of three - dimensional calculations . analyses of the local quasi - fermi level and of the thermo - ballistic current have provided detailed insight into the interplay of the ballistic and diffusive transport mechanisms .",
    "the description may be extended in several ways .",
    "so far , we have regarded the band edge profile as given , so that the integral equation for the resistance function is linear ; this is justified for weak bias . in the general case ,",
    "the equation is nonlinear and must be solved self - consistently together with the poisson equation for the band edge profile .",
    "tunneling effects can be incorporated in the formulation by changing the classical expression for the transmission probabilities to the corresponding wkb expressions .",
    "inhomogeneously doped samples like , e.g. , p - n junctions , can be treated by introducing a position - dependent mean free path .",
    "this involves a simple generalization of the expressions for the probabilities of occurrence of the ballistic intervals .",
    "another possible extension is to include the effect of illumination . to this end , the formalism is immediately adapted to the transport of holes .",
    "a mechanism for the absorption of light must be introduced , which would eventually lead to the determination of the photoconductance .",
    "implementing extensions of this kind in the unified description of carrier transport should enable one to apply it in the analysis of experiment data , e.g. , for polycrystalline semiconducting materials where carrier transport is governed by sequences of potential barriers arising from carrier trapping at grain boundaries .",
    "an extension of the present approach of great topical interest would be to include the electron spin as an additional degree of freedom .",
    "this would allow us to treat spin - polarized transport and , thereby , to make contact with the newly developing field of semiconductor spintronics @xcite .",
    "there , the drift - diffusion approach has commonly been used @xcite to describe the transport of spin - polarized electrons . only very recently ,",
    "a synthesis of diffusive and ballistic spin transport has been attempted @xcite .    in conclusion , we point out that the applicability of our approach is limited mainly by two features .",
    "first , the assumption of a one - dimensional geometry leaves as principal fields of application the transport in parallel - plane heterostructures ( including two - dimensional wires ) as well as in polycrystalline semiconducting materials with a virtually one - dimensional grain - boundary structure .",
    "second , quantum coherence effects are beyond the scope of the present semiclassical approach .",
    "therefore , limits are set to the treatment of transport in nanostructures at low temperatures , where the phase coherence lengths play a dominant role .",
    "we are grateful to a.  ecker and b.  bohne for their assistance in the numerical calculations and in the preparation of the figures .",
