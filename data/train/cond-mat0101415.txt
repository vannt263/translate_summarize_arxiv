    "it is a great pleasure to contribute to the volume dedicated to professor e. n. economou with work that attempts to bridge the gap between localization and propagation in complex discrete systems . in the long - standing contributions of prof .",
    "economou , localization is induced via quenched disorder while propagation is a result of either higher dimensions or nonlinearity . in our present work , coherent energy transfer occurs as a result of judicious interlocking of disorder with nonlinearity and an appropriate exploitation of the concept of nonlinear resonance .",
    "resonance is the basic principle for energy propagation in spatially periodic linear systems .",
    "the simplest example in textbooks is obtained for two coupled identical harmonic oscillators . in this case",
    ", it is well known that any amount of energy deposited on one of the two oscillators tunnels back and forth between these two oscillators with a frequency proportional to the coupling . on the other side , in order to keep the energy localized in a given harmonic oscillator , the resonance between this oscillator and the other harmonic oscillators must be broken .",
    "this situation can be reached in a harmonic infinite system for an impurity mode or , more generally , by breaking translational invariance , for instance through strong enough disorder or by quasiperiodic modulations . roughly speaking , finding a harmonic oscillator that is well resonant within the frequency interval @xmath0 with another oscillator",
    "generally requires to go far from the initial one , typically at a distance @xmath1 in a model at dimension @xmath2 .",
    "but since the effective coupling between these two almost resonant oscillators drops exponentially as a function of their distance , the resonance is generally not sufficient for allowing a substantial energy transfer",
    ". this effect blocks energy propagation and causes the anderson localization of the eigenmodes @xcite .",
    "when the system becomes nonlinear , this picture is drastically changed because the frequency of an anharmonic oscillator depends on its amplitude . concerning the time - periodic solutions",
    ", we have shown that nonlinearity plays a  double game \" @xcite .",
    "first , by adjusting appropriately the amplitude of the nonlinear oscillators , nonlinearity could restore resonances between anharmonic oscillators which were lost in the linearized system .",
    "indeed , small nonlinearity is sufficient to generate exact extended solutions in random systems while the whole linear spectrum is localized .",
    "although these solutions appear spatially intermittent , they can propagate some nonvanishing amount of energy ( much smaller though than standard uniform plane waves ) .",
    "their existence demonstrates that random systems with a small nonlinearity can propagate energy while the same systems without nonlinearity can not .",
    "second , with different amplitudes for the nonlinear oscillators , nonlinearity can also maintain ( or magnify ) the lack of resonance of a localized vibration with the other modes .",
    "thus , the same system can also sustain exact localized nonlinear modes .",
    "moreover , the existence of these modes may not require randomness .",
    "mode localization can also be achieved in a nonlinear spatially periodic system provided the frequency and its harmonics are nonresonant with the extended linear modes ( i.e. , they do not belong to the linear phonon band ) .",
    "these modes are called discrete breathers @xcite .",
    "discrete breathers ( dbs ) , also called intrinsic localized modes , are spatially localized time - periodic solutions of discrete classical nonlinear dynamical systems which could be finite or infinite in arbitrary dimension , spatially periodic or random , etc .",
    "many early works predated their discovery .",
    "for example , polarons are nonlinear objects belonging to the family of dbs introduced long ago by landau @xcite .",
    "the concept of _ local modes _ was independently introduced in chemistry also long ago @xcite for small molecules . in that case ,",
    "discreteness was implicitly necessary .",
    "incidentally , these solutions are recognized to be important for understanding the quantization of molecular vibrations @xcite .    renewed interest on these nonlinear concepts but within the framework of integrable models which have exceptional ( but sometimes physically misleading ) properties started during the 1970 s .",
    "the self - trapping equation introduced later in the mid-1980 s already revealed some features characteristic of dbs but only in special cases ( see a recent interesting review by a. scott @xcite ) .",
    "many interesting physical ideas of applications in physics were proposed , but were limited by flaws of the underlying theories .",
    "they could be reconsidered and amended using the more universal concept of db .",
    "it was only in 1988 that sievers and takeno @xcite claimed the existence of dbs as long lifetime solutions in general models , finite or _ infinite _",
    ", on the basis of approximate analytical and numerical calculations ( see review @xcite ) . actually , their claims were definitely confirmed later by a rigorous proof of their existence as exact solutions in klein - gordon systems under rather general conditions of non resonance @xcite .",
    "moreover , dbs were proven to be linearly stable and robust to model perturbations ( i.e. , not restricted to specific models ) .",
    "subsequently , the scope of validity of this proof has been extended to more general models with optical or acoustic phonons and with arbitrary complexity in any dimension @xcite .",
    "this general theory also brought new methods for systematic and accurate numerical investigations @xcite .",
    "the existence of dbs essentially requires _ discreteness and nonlinearity _ ( randomness is not necessary despite the fact that dbs could persist in its presence ) .",
    "thus , these conditions fully take into account two essential characteristics of real matter .",
    "it is discrete , because it is made of atoms , and nonlinear , because the interatomic potentials are nonlinear .",
    "dbs may exist generically as exact solutions when the frequency of a local mode and _ all of its harmonic _ frequencies either belong to phonon gaps or are above the whole phonon spectrum .",
    "otherwise , these local modes would radiate away their energy by the fundamental frequency or some harmonics and thus survive only over a finite time .",
    "however , if the radiation occurs by high order harmonics , the lifetime of this local mode at 0 k may be long but nevertheless finite .",
    "thus , it is clear that db existence as _ exact solution _ crucially depends on the gap structure of the phonon spectrum .",
    "an exact db solution at a given frequency ( or action ) may exist in one model but may disappear in another very similar model just because some high order harmonic becomes resonant with phonons .",
    "another essential property is that dbs come as one parameter family which can be parametrized by their frequency ( or , better , their action which can be used for semiclassical quantization ) .",
    "dbs may have a lot of other amazing properties not fully explored yet but which depend on the considered models .",
    "they scatter elastically linear phonons ( without energy exchange ) like static impurities .",
    "they may filter phonon noise coloring the spectrum @xcite .",
    "inelastic interactions with small amplitude phonons ( generally ) occur at higher order",
    ". then , dbs may slowly decay while in other situations unexpectedly they may grow @xcite by pumping energy from the background .",
    "they are generally pinned to the lattice but may become highly mobile in some special situations @xcite and then they contribute to energy propagation instead of trapping it .",
    "they can also react by fission or fusion @xcite .    because they are _ exact solutions _ at 0 k , and the interaction between dbs drops very fast as a function of their distance , at low temperature the only physical way for a quasi - isolated db to decay is by the small interaction with its _ own phonon background_. actually , the real spectrum of this phonon background is essential for determining the true db lifetime .",
    "phenomenological interactions modeled for example by a _",
    "white _ langevin noise and damping ( or , equivalently , a coupling with a large collection of harmonic oscillators with a uniform structureless spectrum ) , systematically destroy the db as an exact solution simply because the phonon spectrum extends to infinity without gaps .",
    "thus , the lifetime obtained by such approaches widely used in physics , is nothing but the result of the assumptions that are made and might be physically misleading .",
    "consequently , when the temperature is sufficiently low ( compared to the db energy ) and the dbs sufficiently far apart , energy trapping by dbs may be substantial and persist over extremely long time in apparent violation of the standard fourier law .",
    "therefore , the most important feature characterizing ( pinned ) dbs ( and distinguishing them from ordinary phonons and local modes ) , is that in appropriate conditions where they can be created ( by external excitations or by other processes breaking initially the thermal equilibrium ) , they may spontaneously appear and _ persist _ as spatially localized dynamical structures with unusually _",
    "long lifetime_.    numerical simulations clearly demonstrate that in systems where linearly stable dbs exist , they show up spontaneously under thermal shocks @xcite or when starting from initial states far from thermodynamic equilibrium @xcite .",
    "they trap energy over very long time and generate unusual energy relaxation ( stretched exponentials ) .",
    "this long lifetime of dbs should be relevant for understanding many anomalous energy relaxations especially in disordered matter ( glasses , polymers , biopolymers ) which up to day do not have yet truly satisfactory interpretations .",
    "up to now , experimentalists did not pay much attention to this new paradigm in physics .",
    "one of the reasons might have been that dbs could be easily confused with early concepts inherited from the theory of integrable systems such as ( nondiscrete ) breathers and solitons(perhaps because of the terminology ) .",
    "otherwise , the localization or the anomalous relaxation of energy observed in real experiments , are usually interpreted by randomness , metastable states etc .    in spite of the general belief ,",
    "some experimentalists recently observed dbs with different techniques and in different systems , for example in coupled nonlinear optical wave guides @xcite , in coupled arrays of josephson junctions @xcite , in some nonlinear materials @xcite , in magnetic systems @xcite and even possibly in myoglobin @xcite .",
    "after this brief review we now come to the main aim of this paper which is to present a novel property termed targeted db energy transfer that enables possible perfect transfer of energy between two dbs .",
    "this idea was already briefly suggested in @xcite and considered in term of phase dynamics in @xcite .",
    "we give here a precise analytic treatment of this effect through a generalized dimer model .",
    "we should point out that our results do not agree with the scenario imagined in @xcite .",
    "although , this phenomenon can only exist in appropriate models and for appropriate dbs , it could become the key for understanding puzzling phenomena of well - focused energy transfer in physics and especially in biomolecules .",
    "the energy tunneling between two resonant harmonic oscillators is described through the linear superposition of the symmetric and antisymmetric modes .",
    "this is of course not possible when the oscillators are ( strongly ) anharmonic .",
    "we show in this section that we can model the energy transfer in this case by an integrable generalized dimer model .",
    "we shall study more generally the energy transfer between two dbs so that the energy transfer between two oscillators becomes a particular case .",
    "we consider an arbitrary anharmonic system ( d ) ( finite or infinite ) called _ donor molecule _ described by some set of variables and conjugate variables @xmath3 and a hamiltonian @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that this molecule can sustain dbs and select one of them called donor db .    as we know",
    ", dbs come as continuous family parametrized for example through their action ( which is @xmath5 integrated on the loop representing the db in the phase space ) .",
    "then , db s energy @xmath6 becomes a function of action and its frequency is @xmath7 .",
    "we also assume that this db family is gapless , i.e. , @xmath8 for @xmath9 when the db is vanishing at zero energy .",
    "we consider a second arbitrary anharmonic system ( a ) ( finite or infinite ) called _ acceptor molecule _ with properties similar to the donor molecule .",
    "we select on the acceptor molecule a family of acceptor db with action @xmath10 and energy @xmath11 . as with the donor system",
    ", we assume that acceptor db is also gapless .",
    "subsequently , we introduce a weak coupling between the donor molecule and the acceptor molecule .",
    "these two systems could physically represent two independent molecules or two linked parts of the same macromolecule relatively far from one another .",
    "the weak coupling interaction could either come from contact ( hydrogen bonds , van der waals forces ) , from ( screened ) coulomb interactions , could be mediated by the solvent , or come directly from the intermediate link of the macromolecule if any , etc .",
    "we would like to find the conditions for complete transfer of the energy of a db from donor molecule with action @xmath12 , after some time , to a db on the acceptor molecule .",
    "since the coupling is weak , this transfer will be slow .",
    "then , at any intermediate time @xmath13 , the dynamics of the system will be well described over a time scale long compared to the period by two dbs with action @xmath14 on the donor and @xmath10 on the acceptor .",
    "this solution is well represented in terms of loop dynamics @xcite as an almost invariant closed loop in the phase space which projects like dbs on the isolated molecules in the complementary donor and the acceptor subspace .",
    "thus , the action of this loop is nothing but the sum of the actions of these two isolated dbs .",
    "because of the weak coupling between donor and acceptor systems , this loop evolves slowly in the phase space .",
    "liouville theorem states that the action of a loop evolving in the phase space is time - constant .",
    "thus , we have @xmath15 another necessary condition is the conservation of the total energy @xmath16 yielding @xmath17 which is a function independent of @xmath14 for @xmath18 . differentiating ( [ eq : consenerg ] ) with respect to @xmath14 readily yields that the frequencies @xmath19 of the donor db and @xmath20 remain identical during the energy transfer , i.e. , the two dbs remain resonant .",
    "actually , this condition ( [ eq : consenerg ] ) does not need to be perfectly fulfilled ( since the coupling energy should also be involved in the energy conservation ) but we shall assume that it is almost fulfilled .",
    "we wish to describe the coupled donor - acceptor system through an effective hamiltonian expressing the energy transfer only as a function of the variables @xmath14 and @xmath10 and their conjugate variables @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "however , the restriction to two pairs of variables will be valid only if condition ( [ eq : consenerg ] ) is not fulfilled precisely or even approximately by any other db of the acceptor molecule for the same total action @xmath12 and the same total energy @xmath23 .",
    "in other words , we assume that the acceptor db is unique . we shall assume also , but only for simplicity , that the donor db is unique .",
    "this condition is imposed for avoiding more complex situations with bifurcating transfer of energy to two or more acceptor db .",
    "it is in principle fulfilled for molecules without any special symmetry .    a priori , the small coupling energy , @xmath24 depends on @xmath25 and @xmath26 , on the angle difference",
    "@xmath27 ( conjugate to @xmath28 ) supposed to vary slowly because of the above assumptions ( weak coupling and almost resonance ) , and on the total angle @xmath29 ( conjugate to @xmath30 ) which on the opposite varies fast at the scale of the db periods .",
    "it is then justified to average the coupling over the fast variable @xmath31 ( which varies practically linearly over relatively long time ) and drop the @xmath31 dependence .",
    "next , it is convenient to split the coupling energy as a sum @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the average of @xmath34 over @xmath35 , while the average of @xmath36 over @xmath35 is zero .",
    "then , the effective hamiltonian regarding the two dbs of the coupled molecules can be written in the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 which has zero average with respect to @xmath35 . moreover , for @xmath40 , either the acceptor db or the donor db vanishes which removes any @xmath35 dependence .",
    "then , @xmath41 .    since this hamiltonian does not depend on @xmath31 , @xmath42 , which implies that the total action @xmath43 is conserved .",
    "because of the averaging over the fast variable @xmath31 , @xmath35 essentially represents the difference between the db phases on the donor and acceptor molecules .",
    "effective hamiltonian ( [ eq : hameff ] ) with @xmath30 a constant parameter is nothing but the hamiltonian for the db phase ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a formal theory of phase dynamics ) .    for donor and acceptor molecules with explicitly given hamiltonians and coupling ,",
    "it is possible to calculate numerically this effective hamiltonian and thus to predict the possibility of complete targeted transfer .",
    "this hamiltonian can be formally written as a generalized discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) dimer model when defining the complex variables @xmath44 at the donor site @xmath2 and @xmath45 at the acceptor site @xmath46 .",
    "then , the conservation of the total action @xmath30 is equivalent to the conservation of the total norm @xmath47 .",
    "this approach could be easily modified when the frequency of one of the two dbs is resonant with a harmonic of the other one .",
    "we could then analyze more accurately for dbs the problem of fermi resonance usually considered for quasilinear modes .",
    "this approach can be also extended when there are more than two weakly coupled nonlinear oscillators .",
    "we then obtain a generalized dnls model on a lattice .",
    "it is also extendable for quantum anharmonic oscillators .",
    "we then obtain a quantum generalized dnls model which is nothing but a boson model on a lattice . in this case , the assumption of conservation of the classical action becomes conservation of the number of bosons and nonlinearity becomes many - body interactions . on this basis",
    "we can generalize early calculations based on rotating wave approximations , which were initially restricted to specific models ( e.g. theory of the davydov soliton , see @xcite ) .",
    "expanding the obtained effective hamiltonians at the lowest significant order simply yields standard quartic dnls models .",
    "however , we also learn from our approach that these approximations are only valid in the weak coupling limit , i.e. , close to an anticontinuous limit , which was not clearly stated in the early approaches .",
    "it is thus inconsistent to describe later these dnls models from their continuous limit where they are integrable .",
    "these extended problems will be discussed later in further publications .",
    "we search for solutions of the dynamical system defined by hamiltonian ( [ eq : hameff ] ) , which correspond to a total energy transfer .",
    "these solutions are such that if at the initial time all the energy is on the donor molecule , i.e. , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , it will be completely transferred at a later time @xmath50 on the acceptor molecules , i.e. , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "then , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we say by definition that when this situation occurs , we have targeted energy transfer .    since for @xmath55 , as well as for @xmath56 , the angle @xmath35 is undetermined , the topology of the phase space defined by the conjugate variables @xmath57 is the one of a 2d sphere represented in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "any point @xmath58 of this sphere can be represented by the two coordinates which are the angular coordinate @xmath35 ( longitude ) of its projection in the @xmath59 plane and @xmath28 is its @xmath60 coordinate ( latitude ) .",
    "the poles of the sphere are the points where @xmath40 .",
    "there are two time invariants for this hamiltonian which are @xmath30 and the total energy @xmath61 . then , @xmath62 defines contour lines on the sphere @xmath57 which represent the orbits of the dynamical systems in the 2d phase space .",
    "since these contour lines are closed loops , @xmath63 is time - periodic . actually , the solution in the original system consisting of the coupled donor and acceptor molecules , is a two site db the period of which varies periodically with the same period as @xmath63 .",
    "thus , the global solution is quasiperiodic",
    ".    the dynamical solutions of the system can be classified in two types .",
    "type 1 corresponds to the orbits on the sphere which are homotopic to zero , i.e. , that can be continuously shrunk to zero without crossing a pole . for these trajectories , @xmath35 oscillates between two bounds .",
    "the limit case where @xmath35 does not oscillate , corresponds to exact dbs .",
    "they correspond to extrema of the energy ( [ eq : orbit ] ) on the sphere at fixed @xmath30 .",
    "type 2 corresponds to the orbits which turn around the axis connecting the two poles .",
    "then , @xmath35 rotates by @xmath64 around the sphere at each period of @xmath63 .",
    "a trajectory corresponding to a targeted energy transfer between the donor db and the acceptor db is such that along the orbit , @xmath63 varies between @xmath30 and @xmath65 .",
    "thus , it is an orbit connecting directly the two poles of the sphere @xmath57 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that a necessary and sufficient condition for having a targeted transfer solution at action @xmath30 , is that the system only accepts type 1 solutions at this total action .",
    "let us explicit more carefully , this condition .",
    "since the two poles must be at the same energy , we have @xmath66 at the uncoupled limit @xmath67 , this condition is fulfilled when ( [ eq : consenerg ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "if @xmath68 is not constant , the contour lines are just circles at constant @xmath28 and are of type 2 and thus , we do not have targeted energy transfer .",
    "when the coupling is turned on , targeted energy transfer requires that there exists an action @xmath12 associated with an energy @xmath23 such that eq.([eq : nlrescond1 ] ) is fulfilled for @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "then , for @xmath70 , this closed orbit on the sphere is defined by implicit equation @xmath71 function @xmath72 vanishes at the poles for @xmath73 and characterizes the detuning between the donor and acceptor dbs during the energy transfer .",
    "we term it _ detuning energy function_. in some sense , @xmath74 extends the concept of peierls - nabarro energy barrier , which concerns only static excitations , to dbs , which are dynamical nontopological excitations .",
    "however , note now that the barrier in energy might be positive or negative . with no restrictions on the choice of the coupling functions @xmath75",
    ", it is rather easy to find sophisticated dependence on @xmath35 ( but a bit unrealistic ) , such that there can not exist any contour line connecting the two poles .",
    "thus , it is convenient to require some properties for the @xmath35 dependence which also make the coupling physically reasonable especially if this coupling is small .",
    "we shall assume that it is sine - like and that is it has only one maximum and one minimum per period for @xmath76 .",
    "this coupling function @xmath75 has two ( and only two ) zeros per period with respect to @xmath35 since its average is zero .",
    "more generally , eq.([eq : orbit2 ] ) determines either two values modulo @xmath64 for @xmath35 or no values . a necessary and sufficient condition for having two solutions @xmath77 and @xmath78 which are continuous functions of @xmath28 on the sphere @xmath57",
    "is simply @xmath79    functions @xmath77 and @xmath78 determine the two segments of the closed contour line which connects the two poles of the sphere @xmath57 .",
    "the corresponding trajectory is a trajectory which realizes a targeted energy transfer .",
    "we note that during the time @xmath50 , the phase difference between the donor and acceptor dbs @xmath80 does not rotate over the trigonometric circle but varies in some interval .",
    "we have just demonstrated ( for a physically reasonable sine - like dependence of the coupling on the phase difference ) that targeted energy transfer solutions do persist when the detuning energy function is not strictly zero provided the detuning energy function is bounded by the max and the min of the coupling function .",
    "when the detuning function is small , this coupling may be also small .",
    "the targeted energy transfer solution at @xmath81 may be lost when varying the model parameters .",
    "it suffices that condition ( [ eq : detuning ] ) is no more fulfilled . at the threshold",
    ", there is a certain value @xmath82 of @xmath28 where @xmath83 .",
    "then , @xmath84 .",
    "consequently , point @xmath85 is an extremum of the energy ( [ eq : orbit ] ) on the sphere so that @xmath86 is time - independent , which in the initial system is time - periodic .",
    "they correspond to exact db solutions of the coupled system made of the donor and acceptor molecules .",
    "thus , the threshold where targeted transfer disappears , can be precisely associated with the appearance of a new db solution of the whole system .",
    "when approaching this threshold , the targeted transfer solution becomes cnoidal , i.e. , the time of transfer diverges because the energy transfer slows down in the vicinity of @xmath82 where the new db solution will appear .",
    "we now investigate explicitly the targeted energy transfer solutions in exactly solvable dimer models which describe quite well the general behavior in the weak coupling limit .",
    "dnls dimer models were studied in many early works @xcite but only in special cases with no special attention to the detuning function .",
    "energy transfer solutions were already found but for relatively large coupling in cases where the detuning function ( [ eq : orbit2 ] ) was not small .",
    "it is thus instructive to reconsider a more general quartic dnls dimer model as an illustration of our general theory .",
    "we consider a dimer with hamiltonian @xmath87 where @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 are parameters .",

    "it is never obtained when @xmath114 , i.e. , when the nonlinear coefficients on both sites are equal , except when @xmath115 .",
    "the case @xmath114 , @xmath115 , which was treated in ref.@xcite , is special because @xmath12 is undetermined .",

    "this theory of targeted transfer can be used in practice in complex systems to detect targeted transfer because the functions involved in the effective dimer hamiltonian ( [ eq : hameff ] ) can be explicitly calculated . for that purpose ,",
    "the initial system has to be separated into two coupled subsystems .",
    "the first one will sustain the donor db and the second one the acceptor db .",
    "the coupling between the two systems is not necessarily weak if the considered dbs are far from each other but the effective coupling has to be weak .    using the numerical techniques",
    "developed earlier for the calculations of dbs in arbitrarily complex systems @xcite , one chooses a db solution in the isolated donor system and calculate its dynamical configuration @xmath176 , its energy , and its action .",
    "then , varying the frequency , one obtains function @xmath177 .",
    "the same can be done for a db in the acceptor system . for a complete targeted transfer",
    ", we require that both dbs be gapless , i.e. , @xmath177 and @xmath178 can be continued to @xmath151 where @xmath179 .",
    "since the _ effective _ coupling between the two dbs is supposed to be small , @xmath12 can be determined approximately by the equality @xmath180 , which requires that the two curves intersect at @xmath181 . for having targeted transfer at reasonably small coupling",
    ", function @xmath182 should be small .",
    "once these conditions are fulfilled , we have to check that our dimer assumption is valid , i.e. , that there is no other db either on the donor system or the acceptor system with almost the energy functions @xmath177 or @xmath178 in the interval @xmath183 $ ] .",
    "next , the coupling energy between the two systems is considered .",
    "it is originally a function of the global system configuration @xmath3 and @xmath184 it yields the effective coupling in the dimer model by averaging this energy over the fast variable @xmath31 for the system configuration @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "it is thus only a function of @xmath30 , @xmath28 and @xmath35 which has to be small .    comparing the precise detuning function and the coupling functions as in eq.([eq : detuning ] )",
    ", we can predict rather accurately the possible existence of targeted transfer solutions between these donor and acceptor dbs . in the cases we tested up to now , where these conditions are correctly fulfilled ,",
    "molecular dynamics confirmed the existence of targeted transfer where almost 100% of the energy oscillates for a very long time between the donor and the acceptor db . as expected also",
    ", this energy transfer is blocked as soon as the initial amount of energy is not optimal or the coupling too weak @xcite .",
    "dbs are out of equilibrium excitations . in real systems , which are not strictly at 0 k",
    ", they interact with the phonon modes and other excitations which should make their lifetime finite .",
    "thermalization should be in principle a consequence of intrinsic nonlinearities of the system .",
    "however , standard approaches usually simulate thermalization and relaxation by a white langevin noise and an extra damping .",
    "this is known to be equivalent to a coupling of the initial system with a fictitious extra system consisting of an infinite set of harmonic oscillators with a uniform distribution of frequencies @xcite .",
    "this is clearly a bias which makes the dbs to systematically radiate energy in this bath and artificially washes out their existence as very long lifetime solutions . actually , the long lifetime of dbs is precisely due to the fact that they have no resonance with the linear phonon spectrum which implies that either their frequencies are above the phonon spectrum or there are gaps in this phonon spectrum .",
    "it is the nonuniform and specific phonon spectrum of the model itself which should be considered for studying db lifetime as we started to do in some recent works @xcite . in other words , real systems",
    "exhibit a selective damping depending on the frequencies of their modes which should be explicitly taken into account to be physically correct .",
    "thus , the thermal bath assumption with a uniform phonon spectrum is not physically founded and , worst , induces the denaturation of the model .",
    "we discussed above the ideal case for targeted energy transfer at 0 k. for obtaining an ideal transfer , besides the adiabaticity hypothesis , the donor and acceptor dbs must be gapless .",
    "this condition requires that there exist no linear modes in the donor ( or the acceptor ) system with frequency in the range of variation of the dbs frequency .",
    "indeed , it has been shown in @xcite that before the frequency of a db collides with a linear mode frequency , it systematically bifurcates with another one . in this case , the db is not strictly continuable to zero amplitude .",
    "there is a frequency discontinuity corresponding to the region where the resonance with the linear mode destroys the db . strictly speaking ,",
    "when there is a linear mode in the range of variation of frequency of a db on the donor ( or acceptor ) system , this db exhibits a nonvanishing energy gap which in principle invalidates our assumptions for describing the coupled system as a generalized dimer model ( [ eq : hameff ] ) . as a consequence , the frequency of the ideal targeted transfer solution precisely oscillates in between the edges of a gap of the linear phonon spectrum .",
    "we would like to briefly discuss here what can happen to targeted energy transfer if there is just a single resonant linear mode in the phonon gap , first in the case of strong coupling , i.e. , this linear mode is spatially located close to the donor ( or the acceptor ) dbs .",
    "as we just said , the db of the donor ( or the acceptor ) will exhibit an energy gap , so that the detuning function can not be defined for the whole interval of variation of @xmath28 .",
    "the energy transfer will become incomplete and irreversible . as the frequency of the targeted energy transfer solution approaches the linear resonance , a substantial fraction of the energy",
    "will be suddenly transferred to this linear mode instead of the acceptor db .",
    "consequently , the frequency of the donor db will change independently of the acceptor db .",
    "the loss of resonance between donor and acceptor db stops immediately the energy transfer .",
    "if one assumes that the energy captured by the linear resonant mode does not return significantly to the donor db , the part of the energy left on the donor system and of the linear mode , could be dissipated into phonons through chaotic processes and finally heat .",
    "then , only a well - defined fraction of the initial energy on the donor has been transferred and the excess of energy has been dissipated into heat .",
    "we obtained only an incomplete but irreversible targeted transfer .",
    "the effect should be much less sharp when the linear mode which is resonant with the donor db is weaker , i.e. , the resonant linear mode is physically located far away from the donor and acceptor dbs , say , in order to fix the ideas , on the donor system . then , there is only a small discontinuity gap in frequency to jump for the donor dbs where function @xmath6 is undefined . we think that despite a small energy loss when crossing the resonance , targeted energy transfer could be continued beyond this resonance and be almost completed .",
    "if there are many such weak resonances they could be described as a frequency dependent damping depending on the distribution and coupling with resonant linear modes .",
    "resonances with bands of extended phonons should have a similar effect .",
    "actually , in realistic systems there are likely some linear modes in the phonon gap causing some energy dissipation and making energy transfer irreversible . on the opposite , at finite temperature , thermal activation of the linear modes",
    "could also help targeted energy transfer by stochastic resonance effects .",
    "these problems will be investigated in the future .",
    "we have demonstrated here that the essential difference between linear and nonlinear resonance ( allowing the targeted energy transfer ) is that nonlinear resonance is _ selective _ in energy ( or action ) , unlike linear resonance , which is not .",
    "targeted energy transfer occurs because the frequencies of the donor oscillator or db and acceptor oscillator or db , although they both vary during the transfer , remain almost equal .",
    "this condition can be achieved at weak coupling , only for a certain initial energy @xmath23 and when a certain detuning function is small enough compared to the coupling energy . in the ideal case ,",
    "an amount of energy @xmath23 deposited on the donor db oscillates slowly and periodically back and forth between donor and acceptor .",
    "it is totally transferred between the donor and the acceptor db at periodic times .",
    "otherwise , although there is some energy oscillation , the energy transfer becomes negligible .",
    "we do not believe that the obtained targeted energy transfer solutions correspond to strictly exact solutions of the initial model because of the hypothesis of adiabaticity which can not be perfectly fulfilled .",
    "however , situations close to the ideal case could exist where the number of energy oscillations between donor and acceptor dbs is very large .",
    "the high sensitivity to the initial energy makes that this energy transfer can be easily stopped by intermediate linear resonance which can be viewed as a kind of transistor effect .",
    "this effect could be used in practical devices ( e.g. , with optical fibers ) .",
    "we may consider situations where , instead of one , there are several dbs on the donor system with almost identical functions @xmath177 and one acceptor db on the acceptor system .",
    "then , if we are in the condition of targeted energy transfer for a single donor db , any donor dbs excited at the energy @xmath23 will transfer their energy to the acceptor db .",
    "however , the transfer has good chances to be irreversible because when the transfer is completed , the acceptor energy could return simultaneously to all donor dbs but then the resonance between the donor dbs and the acceptor db will be broken and the transfer will be blocked .",
    "this situation is interesting for realizing energy funneling analogous to what is observed in chlorophyll @xcite .",
    "we may also consider situations such that for an energy @xmath187 , the acceptor db ( a ) is tuned to another acceptor db ( @xmath188 ) .",
    "then , before the transfer from the initial donor ( d ) to the acceptor ( a ) is completed , this acceptor ( a ) transfer its energy to the next acceptor ( @xmath188 ) with some energy loss ( note that the db @xmath188 acts initially like an intragap linear resonance ) but instead of dissipating energy , it may collect most of the @xmath46 acceptor energy . by this way",
    ", recurrent transfer could be built along a certain well determined sequence of acceptor dbs .",
    "we could then realize irreversible cascades of energy transfer ( with some energy losses however ) .",
    "it is also important to realize now that dbs in molecules may have piezoactive effects , i.e. , they might generate deformation of the molecules as emphasized in @xcite .",
    "this effect could be important for example for understanding the energy conversion of atp into mechanical energy ( molecular motors ) .",
    "the energy deposition from atp could occur first as a db located at a certain receptive site of the moving biomolecule ( e.g. , kinesin adsorbed on a microtubule ) .",
    "then , this db could cascade by targeted energy transfer through a series of dbs located at specific sites of the biomolecule generating a well determined sequence of deformations which lead to a well determined motion of the biomolecule ( step ) along the oriented microtubule after the time @xmath189 necessary for this cascade process . beyond this time , the db energy is finally relaxed into heat .",
    "thus , excitations by atp randomly repeated at time intervals longer than this characteristic time @xmath189 should produce systematically a directive walk of this biomolecule along the microtubule ( this motion should become randomly intermittent in time if the atp concentration is low ) . in the future",
    ", we plan to use and to develop our tools for calculating dbs in nonlinear systems for controlling precisely their targeted energy transfer , funneling , cascades , piezoactivity of dbs and thus for designing artificial models with desired properties mimicking those of biosystems .",
    "let us also note that instead of being atomic vibrations , these dbs could be electronic vibrations ( excitons ) , polarons , or atomic vibrations combined with an electronic charge ( polarobreathers ) @xcite .",
    "thus , there are many possible variations of the targeted transfer principle depending on the considered physical problem ( transfer of energy , charge , spin , etc ) and its scale of energy .",
    "this theory of targeted transfer could be useful , for example , for revisiting the standard theories of fluorescence ( @xcite ) , chemical reactions , catalysis , etc .",
