    "many theories beyond the standard model ( sm ) include a dark matter ( dm ) candidate as part of the mass spectrum .",
    "typically , the stability of the dm candidate is the result of an assumed global @xmath8 parity , under which the new ( sm ) particles are odd ( even ) . for example , in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) , this is the so  called r ",
    "parity @xmath9 , while in models with large extra dimensions , this could be a kaluza  klein ( kk ) parity .",
    "if such a dm candidate is produced at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , its presence could be revealed through the observation of large missing transverse energy .",
    "the @xmath8 parity implies that the dm candidate will be pair  produced at the lhc .",
    "this leads to complications in measuring its properties , in particular its mass , since only the vector sum of the transverse momenta of the two dm candidates in an event can be measured .",
    "strategies to circumvent this problem abound in the literature  @xcite .",
    "many of these assume the existence of certain long decay chains .",
    "an important example in the mssm is the pair production of squarks ( @xmath10 ) , followed by the decay chain @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the neutralinos ( @xmath13 is the dm candidate ) , and @xmath14 is a slepton .",
    "the existence of more constraints , mass  shell conditions and dilepton invariant mass edge measurements , than undetermined 4momenta ) unknowns : the four momenta of the two @xmath13 ( 8) , minus the measured missing transverse momenta ( 2 ) . ] would allow simultaneous determination of the mass of the new particles .",
    "these long decay chains imply various challenges for the relevant mass measurement techniques , correct identification of the decay topology and combinatoric problems in assigning the identified final state particles to appropriate stages of the decay chains , and so it is advantageous to consider alternative methods to complement existing strategies .",
    "the central exclusive production ( cep ) of a system @xmath15 can be written in the form @xmath16 where the ` @xmath17 ' signs represent the presence of large rapidity gaps . in this type of reaction ,",
    "only the system @xmath15 is produced in the central detector , with no additional hadronic activity in the absence of pile  up , see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ( and references therein ) for a review .",
    "the outgoing protons scatter at small angles and remain intact , so that additional kinematic information can be obtained by installing proton tagging detectors far from the interaction point  @xcite . in particular",
    ", in the presence of these detectors the momenta of the outgoing protons can be measured precisely , and therefore the longitudinal momentum and invariant mass of the central system x can be accurately determined .    in this paper",
    ", we present a mass measurement method utilising the additional longitudinal kinematic information in the exclusive two  photon production of a pair of charged particles ( @xmath18 ) , @xmath19 followed by the decay @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a visible particle ( or more generally , fully reconstructed system of particles ) , and @xmath22 is an invisible particle that is not seen in the detector . for concreteness , we will consider the specific case of the exclusive two  photon production of a pair of sleptons ( @xmath23 ) , followed by the decay into leptons ( @xmath24 ) and the lightest neutralinos ( @xmath25 ) ( note the different notations compared with ) , @xmath26 leading to a signature with two tagged protons , an opposite  sign same  flavour lepton pair and missing 4momentum with no additional jet activity .",
    "the irreducible sm background comes from the production of @xmath27 pairs , @xmath28    compared to the long decay chain discussed in , the two  photon production process benefits from a clean , purely leptonic signature , with no combinatoric ambiguity .",
    "furthermore , assuming the slepton only decays into the lightest neutralino , the process is essentially a two scale problem that depends on the ( true ) masses of the slepton and the lightest neutralino , @xmath29 , together with discrete parameters such as the particles charges and spins .",
    "the irreducible sm background is also under good experimental control .",
    "this is because in the case of the signal , two  photon production must create two same  flavour sleptons . in the absence of large lepton flavour violation",
    ", this will lead to two same  flavour leptons in the final state . for the sm background",
    "there is no such constraint on the flavour of the final  state leptons : a measurement of the opposite flavour final states @xmath30 would therefore allow a cross check of the background determination .",
    "however , the cross section for the exclusive two  photon production of slepton pairs is small when compared to the inclusive production cross section from hard inelastic scattering , which is roughly two orders of magnitude larger  @xcite : as a result , mass measurement in this central exclusive channel is only realistic at the 14 tev lhc for @xmath31 up to about 200 gev .",
    "however if the coloured sparticles , the squarks and the gluinos , are too heavy to be produced copiously at the lhc , the presence and properties of light colour singlet sparticles may be best measured via two  photon production . if ( as we hope ) the coloured sparticles are produced in abundance , and long decay chains are observed , the present method might still be used as an independent check or to provide external constraints on the long decay chains .",
    "the system in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cepsusy ] ) has four unknowns : only the vector sum of the 4momenta of @xmath32 and @xmath33 is measurable . given a consistent mass hypothesis @xmath34 , the four quadratic mass shell constraints allow the system of equations to be solved analytically , up to a two  fold degeneracy . as a result , a @xmath34 mass region consistent with the measured 4momenta can be obtained on an event  by  event basis .",
    "we believe this consistent mass regions contains all information that can be derived from the measured 4momenta .",
    "neglecting finite detector resolution effects , the ( different ) consistent mass region from each event must contain the true mass point @xmath35 .",
    "combining the consistent regions from a number of events will develop a peaking structure around this point , hence in principle allowing determination of the true masses .    in determining the true masses and in separating the signal from sm background ,",
    "we find the maximum values of @xmath31 ( @xmath36 ) and @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) within the consistent mass region particularly useful .",
    "this is because , by construction , @xmath36 and @xmath38 are bounded from below by @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively .",
    "they are also bounded from above by half the @xmath41 invariant mass @xmath42 and half the missing energy @xmath43 .",
    "an additional advantage is the relative ease in constructing likelihood functions from @xmath36 and @xmath38 , which could be particularly useful given a small data sample , as is likely the case in light of the small two  photon production cross section .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to study how well the slepton and neutralino masses may be determined using @xmath36 and @xmath38 computed in each event .",
    "these masses can also be estimated from @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xcite , which have threshold values at @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively .",
    "we shall compare the two methods and illustrate the improvements that can be made by making use of the mass  shell constraints .",
    "the potential for measuring properties of the sm higgs boson  @xcite , long  lived gluinos  @xcite , stops  @xcite , mssm higgs  @xcite , nmssm higgs  @xcite and other bsm higgs scenarios  @xcite in the central exclusive mode with tagged forward protons have also been discussed in the literature .",
    "note that the decay chain considered can be applied to new physics models with different particle spins , for example the pair production of charged spin1/2 fermions followed by the decay into neutral spin1 bosons , as might be expected from a kk model .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that , given the same masses and charges , the production cross section for spin0 bosons is the smallest when compared with spin1/2 fermions and spin1 bosons , see fig .  [",
    "fig : xsec ] . in this paper , we shall concentrate on the first case , which is the most conservative , and use the susy decay chain in as our working example .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "in section , we present the analytic solutions consistent with the 4momenta measurable in , and derive the quantities @xmath36 and @xmath38 .",
    "we then present the numerical results in section , and compare between the performance of @xmath48 and @xmath49 in determining @xmath35 , after including the cep dynamics simulated by a new event generator @xcite .",
    "this is followed by an estimate of @xmath35 using the likelihood method advertised above assuming an integrated luminosity of @xmath50 at the 14 tev lhc , which is the main result of our paper .",
    "we conclude in section .",
    "the 4momenta of the particles in the decay chain in are subjected to the constraints @xmath51 where ( @xmath52 ) and @xmath53 is the 4momentum vector sum of the two @xmath54 s . for simplicity",

    "@xmath34 is consistent with the measured 4momenta if it results in a positive @xmath68 , in which case a two  fold degenerate solution for ( @xmath81 ) corresponding to @xmath82 is obtained .",
    "the boundary of consistent solutions on the @xmath34 plane is given by by setting @xmath83 . to see this , note that since @xmath58 is space  like , @xmath84 .",
    "this means that for a given @xmath85 , @xmath86 decreases as @xmath68 increases .",
    "an upper boundary on the @xmath87 plane therefore has @xmath88 .",
    "the consistent region is bounded from above by this quadratic curve , and below by the @xmath21axis , @xmath89 , which can be transformed into a boundary in the @xmath34 plane . within the boundary , @xmath90 .",
    "by construction , the solutions are time  like .",
    "more observations on the properties of the consistent solutions can be made .",
    "first , the sign of the energy component of the two solutions ( for @xmath82 ) must be the same , since it is always possible to boost to a frame where the energy component of the space  like vector @xmath58 is zero , in which case the two solutions have the same energies .",
    "second , since the consistent solutions are continuous functions of @xmath37 and @xmath31 , it follows that the energies of all consistent solutions must have the same sign .",
    "the energies must then be positive , due to the fact that the true masses must be a consistent solution , and hence lies within the boundary .",
    "third , the solution is clearly symmetric when exchanging @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "this means that the boundary obtained for the mass  shell conditions for @xmath93 and @xmath94 must be the same , consistent with the fact that both constraints lead to .    as discussed in section [ sec : intro ] , the consistent mass region may be characterised by the maximum values of @xmath37 and @xmath31 , @xmath38 and @xmath36 .",
    "they correspond to the stationary values of @xmath86 and @xmath95 as functions of @xmath85 in .",
    "the results are @xmath96 by construction , @xmath38 and @xmath36 are bounded from below by the true @xmath37 and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "so far we have shown that analytic boundaries containing mass hypotheses consistent with the measured 4momenta can be obtained on an event  by  event basis . in the next section , we present examples showing the densities of consistent solutions given a large number of events , and show the extent to which the quantities @xmath36 and @xmath38 can be used to determine the true masses , crucially in a small event sample .",
    "our numerical study is performed using the new monte carlo ( mc ) event generator @xcite .",
    "it simulates the two  photon exclusive production of a @xmath97 pair and a charged scalar pair , @xmath98 , via the decay chains given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cepsusy ] ) and ( [ eq : cepsm ] ) , as well as the production of two charged fermions , @xmath99 , although we do not discuss this process in detail in this paper .",
    "the equivalent photon approximation  @xcite is used to calculate the photon luminosity @xmath100 due to photon emission from the incoming protons , and this is then combined with the known @xmath101 ( @xmath102 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 ) subprocess cross sections to give the full cep cross section @xmath103 where @xmath27 is the @xmath104 cms energy .",
    "the produced particles are then decayed according to the decay chains given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cepsusy ] ) and ( [ eq : cepsm ] ) , and in the case of @xmath97 production full spin correlations for the subsequent decay are included .",

    "however , given the lhc s ability to measure accurately the 4momenta of the forward protons ( in the presence of proton taggers ) and the charged leptons , the smearing effects should be relatively mild .",

    "we show two additional susy models , specified by @xmath117 gev and @xmath118 gev in addition to the ` reference ' susy model and the sm background .",
    "we see that , compared with the @xmath119 distributions , the @xmath120 distributions benefit from a better signal  to  background ratio ( s / b ) in the signal region , which improves as the mass scale increases . here , the signal region for a distribution is defined as the region above the lower threshold value determined by @xmath35 .",

    "importantly , the distribution of the _ signal _ @xmath45 distributions near the endpoint becomes increasingly smooth as the mass scale increases , leading to possibly large uncertainties in determining the endpoint value .",

    "@xcite , the possibility to measure central exclusive production in the high luminosity phase of the lhc is crucial to a wide range of processes studied in the literature .",

    "nevertheless , we find the level of accuracies obtainable with the small ( @xmath161 ) event sample encouraging .",

    ", the mt2 method  @xcite can be used to determine the true masses by observing a kink structure at the true mass value .",
    "this kink structure is formed by events where the two slepton system recoils against initial state radiation and has a non ",
    "zero transverse momentum .",
    "however the probability that the system has a significant transverse momentum is very low and the kink resides at the smooth tail of the distribution .",
    "once detector smearing effects are included , it is likely that observing such a kink structure will be difficult . in this context ,",
    "measuring the particle masses in this particular decay chain in cep with forward proton tagging might be the best , if not the only , way .    finally , we note that the mass measurement technique presented here could also be used in future linear colliders",

    "<S> we discuss how the mass of new physics particles involved in a pair of short decay chains leading to two invisible particles , for example slepton pair production , followed by the decay into two leptons and two neutralinos , may be measured in central exclusive production ( cep ) with forward proton tagging . </S>",
    "<S> we show how the existing mass measurement strategies in cep may be improved by making full use of the mass  shell constraints , and demonstrate that , with around 30 signal events , the masses of the slepton and neutralino can be measured with an accuracy of a few gev .    </S>",
