    "determining the minimal degree sequence to parameterize a knot may be useful in classifying knots . we choose to work with compact rational knots because they can be contained in a finite region and can be expressed using rational functions .    along the lines of @xcite ,",

    "they determine that the graph of the trefoil s double points must have four monotonic regions , which can only be represented by a degree @xmath12 function , in order to produce the correct over - under crossings .",
