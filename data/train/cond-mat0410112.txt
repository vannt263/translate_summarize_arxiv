    "the transport properties of polycrystalline high temperature superconductors ( htsc ) are recognized to be determined by the intergrain boundaries which are josephson weak links .",
    "the investigation of cvcs should illuminate the mechanisms of current dissipation in the networks of weak links , formed in polycrystalline htsc .",
    "fundamental and applied aspects of this topic remains actual in present@xcite .",
    "there are serious problems accompanying a measurements of a cvcs of htsc .",
    "the main is increasing of temperature due to the selfheating effect@xcite at current higher than its critical value ic and the heat emission on the contacts htsc - current leads .",
    "these effects prevent a precise measure of a cvc in a wide range of currents , including the range @xmath0 where the cvc becomes linear .",
    "influence of the selfheating effects can be avoided by using the break junction technique .",
    "the formation of a microcrack in a bulk sample leads to a significant reduction of the effective cross - section area for charge transport . in the non - tunneling case",
    "two massive polycrystalline banks are connected by weak links constituting narrow part of a bulk sample , so called `` bottleneck '' .",
    "the cvcs and @xmath1 of the whole sample are determined by the bottleneck cross - section area .",
    "for this reason one is possible to measure a cvcs of break junction at bias currents that are much smaller than @xmath1 of the bulk samples , and self - heating effects and vortex motion should significantly reduced .",
    "problem of preparation of the low - resistance contacts of htsc and current - leads is out of scope of this article .",
    "it is under treating now and will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "break junctions made on unconventional superconductors have been studied extensively ( see for example refs.@xcite ) .",
    "the observed characteristic features ( negative differential resistance , hysteretic peculiarity , subgarmonic gap structure , etc . ) are inherent to josephson junctions . in this article",
    "we report on investigation of the cvc of the break junction in polycrystalline htsc _ 1.8_0.3_1.9_2_3_x .",
    "_ 1.8_0.3_1.9_2_3_x was prepared using the solid state reaction technique .",
    "the preparation of the break junction is described in refs.@xcite . during measurement ,",
    "the sample was immersed in a liquid helium bath .",
    "the cvc measurements were carried out under isothermal conditions by slowly scanning a bias current .",
    "the measured cvc ( fig .  [ fig1 ] , dots ) has hysteretic peculiarity and other features , typical for polycrystalline htsc forming network of josephson weak links@xcite .",
    "it is logical to interpret the experimental data in the frame of theories developed for dissipative transport through s - n - s junctions ( where s is superconducting bank , n is normal region ) .",
    "previously we systematically investigated the temperature evolution of cvcs of break junctions in polycrystalline htscs _",
    "2_3_7 @xcite and _ 1.85_0.15_4 @xcite and successfully described their in the framework of the kmmel - gunsenheimer - nicolsky ( kgn ) theory@xcite .",
    "the similar approach is used in this work .",
    "the kgn theory@xcite considers current due to multiple andreev reflections in s - n - s junctions . according to kgn the expression for the cvc of s - n - s junction",
    "is given by : @xmath2 e^{(- n d / l)}\\ ] ] @xmath3 where @xmath4 - fermi distribution function ; @xmath5 , from eq .",
    "( 2.19 ) of ref.@xcite , is the probability of finding the quasiparticles in the n region of thickness @xmath6 and with inelastic mean free path @xmath7 ; @xmath8 - charge and @xmath9 - effective mass of electron ; @xmath10 - number of andreev reflections which a quasiparticle that starts its motion from an andreev level characterized by the quantum - number set @xmath11 undergoes before it moves out of the pair potential well ; @xmath12 , @xmath13 , from eqs .",
    "( a.32 ) , ( a.33 ) of ref.@xcite are the probability amplitudes of n andreev reflections of quasiparticles with directions of propagation parallel ( + ) or antiparallel ( - ) to the electric field ; @xmath14 is the sharvin current , see eq .",
    "( 3.22 ) of ref.@xcite .",
    "the simulated curve ( fig .",
    "1 , solid line ) is calculated with the following parameters of htsc : critical temperature @xmath15 = 112 k , energy gap @xmath16 = 25 mev , relation of n - region thickness to mean free path of electrons @xmath17 = 0.09 , e.g. @xmath6 = 10  , @xmath7 = 110  .",
    "these parameters are physically reasonable and in good agreement with other estimation@xcite .",
    "satisfactory agreement of the simulated curve and the experimental cvc is observed .",
    "it confirms that the hysteretic peculiarity reflects negative differential resistance range which is due to dependence of andreev reflections number on voltage value@xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "as the simulated curve demonstrates , the arch in the experimental cvc is possible the last arch of the subgarmonic gap structure produced multiple andreev reflections too@xcite .",
    "the alike behavior was observed in the experimental cvc of break junction in polycrystalline _",
    "1.85_0.15_4 @xcite .",
    "fig.1 demonstrates the different curvature of the arch in the experimental cvc than one in the calculated curve .",
    "we did not observe the such divergence in a cvcs of polycrystalline _ 1.85_0.15_4 and _ 2_3_7 .",
    "high anisotropy of the crystallites in polycrystalline _",
    "1.8_0.3_1.9_2_3_x may be responsible for it .",
    "however , instead previous considerations@xcite , the presented experimental cvc is described without account of a dispersion of the parameters of the weak links in bottleneck .",
    "more surprising result is the satisfactory agreement of the experiment on htscs ( this article and refs.@xcite ) and the theory@xcite developed for transport through weak links based on conventional superconductors .",
    "further theoretical investigations involving elastic scattering and time - dependent density functional theory for superconductors ( account of the strong electron correlations ) should be performed for more correcting comparison with experiments in htsc .",
