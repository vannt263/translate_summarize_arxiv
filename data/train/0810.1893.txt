    "in 2001 , a new classification method was developed which was based on the relative positions of the data points from various classes ; @xcite introduced the class cover catch digraphs ( cccds ) in @xmath4 and gave the exact distribution of the domination number of the cccds for two classes , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , with uniform distribution on a bounded interval in @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite proved a slln result for the one - dimensional class cover problem . @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite extended the cccds to higher dimensions and demonstrated that cccds are a competitive alternative to the existing methods in classification .",
    "the classification method based on cccds involves data reduction ( condensing ) by using approximate  rather than exact  minimum dominating sets as _ prototype sets _ , since finding the exact minimum dominating set for cccds is an np - hard problem in general .",
    "however for finding a dominating set of cccds on the real line , a simple linear time algorithm is available ( @xcite ) .",
    "but unfortunately , the exact and the asymptotic distributions of the domination number of the cccds are not analytically tractable in multiple dimensions .",
    "to address the latter issue of intractability of the distribution of the domination number in multiple dimensions , @xcite introduced the central similarity proximity maps and @xmath5-factor proportional - edge proximity maps and the associated random proximity catch digraphs .",
    "proximity catch digraphs are a generalization of the cccds .",
    "the asymptotic distribution of the domination number of the latter is calculated and then used in testing spatial patterns between two or more classes .",
    "see @xcite for more detail .    in this article",
    ", we generalize the original result of @xcite to the case of non - uniform @xmath2 points with support being the interval with end points from @xmath3 , and then to multiple @xmath3 points in a bounded interval @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "these generalizations will also serve as the bases for extension of the results for the uniform and non - uniform data in higher dimensions .",
    "let @xmath8 be a measurable space and @xmath9 and @xmath10 be two sets of @xmath11-valued random variables from classes @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , with joint probability distribution @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath13 be any distance function .",
    "the _ class cover problem _ for a target class , say @xmath2 , refers to finding a collection of neighborhoods , @xmath14 around @xmath15 such that ( i ) @xmath16 and ( ii ) @xmath17 .",
    "a collection of neighborhoods satisfying both conditions is called a _",
    "class cover_. a cover satisfying condition ( i ) is a _ proper cover _ of class @xmath2 while a cover satisfying condition ( ii ) is a _ pure cover _ relative to class @xmath3 .",

    "the @xmath25-region is the image of the map @xmath26 that associates the region @xmath27 with the set @xmath28 . for a point @xmath22 ,",

    "the _ data - random cccd _ has the vertex set @xmath31 and arc set @xmath32 defined by @xmath33 .",
    "in particular , we use @xmath34 , the open ball around @xmath15 with radius @xmath35 , as the proximity map as in @xcite .",
    "we call such a digraph a @xmath36-digraph .",
    "a @xmath36-digraph is a",
    "_ pseudo digraph _ according some authors if loops are allowed ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    a data - random cccd for @xmath37 and @xmath38 is referred to as @xmath39-graph in @xcite .",
    "we change the notation to emphasize the fact that @xmath36 is a digraph .",
    "furthermore , @xcite call the proximity map @xmath38 a _ spherical proximity map_.    the @xmath36-digraphs are closely related to the _ proximity graphs _ of @xcite and might be considered as a special case of _ covering sets _ of @xcite and _ intersection digraphs _ of @xcite .",
    "our data - random proximity digraph is a _ vertex - random proximity digraph _ and not a standard one ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the randomness of a @xmath36-digraph lies in the fact that the vertices are random with the joint distribution @xmath12 , but arcs @xmath40 are deterministic functions of the random variable @xmath41 and the random set @xmath14 .",
