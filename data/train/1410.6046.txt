    "the study of patterns in permutations is one of the most active trends of research in combinatorics .",
    "the richness of the notion of permutation patterns is especially evident from its plentiful appearances in several very different disciplines , such as algebra , geometry , analysis , theoretical computer science , and many others .",
    "even if it is arguably not possible to encompass all possible applications of this notion into a simple formal environment , it seems reasonable to assert that the single mathematical structure which best catches the concept of a pattern and allows us to express a great deal of results about it is the _ permutation pattern poset_.    given two permutations @xmath4 , we say that @xmath5 in the permutation pattern poset whenever there is an occurrence of @xmath2 in @xmath1 as a classical pattern .",
    "an extremely challenging open problem concerning the permutation pattern poset is the determination of its mbius function .",
    "the problem , originally posed by wilf @xcite , received quite recently much attention , and some partial results have been achieved @xcite .",
    "however , a complete description of the mbius function of the permutation pattern poset is not yet available .",
    "the same problem can be formulated for the _ consecutive pattern poset _ , where , by definition , @xmath6 whenever @xmath2 appears in @xmath1 as a _ consecutive _ pattern .",
    "this poset is much easier than the classical one and , in particular , its mbius function is now completely understood @xcite .",
    "we recall here that the mbius function @xmath7 of a poset is an important element of the incidence algebra of that poset , i.e. a function mapping an interval of the poset into a scalar .",
    "more specifically , it is possible to give a recursive definition of @xmath7 as follows : @xmath8    in particular , if @xmath9 , then @xmath10 . using a duality argument ,",
    "it is possible to show that the mbius function of an interval can be equally computed  from top to bottom \" , according to the following formula ( for @xmath11 ) : @xmath12    both formulas for computing @xmath7 will be frequently used throughout the paper .",
    "consecutive and classical patterns are special ( actually , extremal ) cases of the more general notion of _ vincular patterns_. an occurrence of a vincular pattern is an occurrence of that pattern in which entries are subject to certain adjacency conditions ( see next section for a precise definition ) .",
    "vincular patterns were introduced by babson and steingrmsson @xcite ( under the name of generalized patterns ) , and constitute a vast intermediate continent between the two lands of consecutive patterns and classical patterns . since the determination of the mbius function is still open in the classical case and totally solved in the consecutive one , it is conceivable that , if one is able to define a reasonable poset structure on permutations depending on the type of vincular patterns under consideration , then the resulting class of permutation posets ( which would somehow interpolate between the consecutive and the vincular posets ) may shed light on the differences and on the analogies between the two extremal cases .    in the present paper",
    "we propose a definition of _ vincular pattern poset of type @xmath13 _ ( whose elements are vincular patterns , or dashed permutations , as defined in section [ posets ] ) , where @xmath13 is a suitable infinite matrix whose @xmath14-th row encodes the type of the pattern of length @xmath14 belonging to the poset ( by specifying which entries of the pattern have to be adjacent in the corresponding dashed permutation ) .",
    "this is done in section [ posets ] , where we also address the problem of understanding in which cases ( that is , for which matrices",
    "@xmath13 ) the partial order thus defined perfectly catches the notion of an @xmath13-vincular pattern ; even if we are not able to give a complete characterization of such matrices , we find some partial results , and in particular we single out a special class of matrices for which everything works in the best possible way . in section [ quasi ]",
    "we consider a single case , probably the closest to the consecutive one , in which all the entries of a pattern are required to be adjacent , except at most the first and the second . in section [ mobius_quasi ] we address the problem of the computation of the mbius function in this poset , which we call the _ quasi - consecutive pattern poset _ , and we completely determine the value @xmath15 when @xmath2 occurs precisely once in @xmath1 . in spite of its closeness with the consecutive case",
    ", it seems that , in the general case , the computation @xmath15 in the quasi - consecutive pattern poset is considerably more complicated .",
    "this is underlined , for instance , by the fact ( hinted at in the last section ) that the absolute value attained by the mbius function seems to be unbounded , whereas in the consecutive pattern poset the only possible values are @xmath16 .",
    "denote with @xmath17 the set of all finite permutations .",
    "elements of @xmath17 are represented in one - line notation , so that @xmath18 is the permutation of length @xmath14 mapping @xmath19 to @xmath20 , for all @xmath21 .",
    "dashed permutation _ is a permutation in which some dashes are possibly inserted between any two consecutive elements .",
    "for instance , @xmath22 is a dashed permutation ( of length 5 ) .",
    "the _ type _ of a dashed permutation @xmath23 of length @xmath14 is the @xmath24-vector @xmath25 ( having @xmath26 components ) such that , for all @xmath27 , @xmath28 whenever there is no dash between @xmath20 and @xmath29 , and @xmath30 whenever there is a dash between @xmath20 and @xmath29 .",
    "for example , the above dashed permutation @xmath22 has type @xmath31 .",
    "we remark that , in different sources , this notion of type is expressed using a different formalism , namely by recording the lengths of each interval of adjacent elements in the dashed permutation .",
    "for instance , the above dashed permutation is said to have type @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath23 be a permutation of length @xmath14 and @xmath33 be a dashed permutation of length @xmath34 .",
    "we say that @xmath23 _ contains an occurrence of the vincular pattern _",
    "@xmath33 when there exists a subsequence @xmath35 of elements of @xmath23 which is order - isomorphic to @xmath33 and such that @xmath36 and @xmath37 appear consecutively inside @xmath23 if there is no dash between @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in this case",
    "we also say that @xmath33 is a vincular patter of @xmath23 .",
    "vincular patterns were introduced in @xcite ( where they are called _ generalized patterns _ ) .",
    "let @xmath13 be an infinite lower triangular @xmath24-matrix , and denote with @xmath40 the @xmath19-th row vector of @xmath13 .",
    "given @xmath41 , we say that @xmath42 is an _ occurrence of a vincular pattern of type @xmath13 _ ( or an _ occurrence of an @xmath13-vincular pattern _ ) in @xmath23 when , given that @xmath33 has length @xmath43 , @xmath23 contains an occurrence of @xmath33 as a vincular pattern of type ( given by the first @xmath44 entries of ) @xmath45 . in this case",
    ", we also write @xmath46 .",
    "if @xmath23 does not contain any occurrence of an @xmath13-vincular pattern @xmath33 , that is @xmath47 , we say that @xmath23 _ avoids _",
    "@xmath33 _ as an @xmath13-vincular pattern_. the most studied special cases are obtained when all the entries of @xmath13 below and on the main diagonal are equal to 1 and when @xmath13 is the null matrix . in the former case",
    "we recover the notion of classical pattern , whereas in the latter one we get the notion of consecutive pattern .    in some cases",
    ", the notion of an @xmath13-vincular pattern can be described by means of a suitable partial order .",
    "given @xmath48 , having lengths @xmath14 and @xmath26 respectively , we say that @xmath23 _ covers _",
    "@xmath33 whenever @xmath33 appears as an @xmath13-vincular pattern in @xmath23 . in this case",
    ", we write @xmath49 , or simply @xmath50 when @xmath13 is clear from the context .",
    "the transitive and reflexive closure of this covering relation is a partial order which will be called the _ a - vincular pattern containment order _ , and the resulting poset will be called the _ a - vincular pattern poset_. when @xmath2 is less than or equal to @xmath1 in the @xmath13-vincular pattern poset , we will write @xmath51 or simply @xmath52 , when no confusion is likely to arise .",
    "it is not difficult to realize that , in the two special cases mentioned above , the resulting posets are well known .",
    "when @xmath13 is the lower triangular matrix having all 1 s below and on the main diagonal we obtain the classical pattern poset , whereas when @xmath13 is the null matrix we get the consecutive pattern poset .",
    "we observe that , in these two cases , the partial order relation @xmath53 coincides with the binary relation @xmath54 , that is @xmath55 if and only if @xmath56 .",
    "however this is not always true , for the relation @xmath54 is not transitive in general . in this direction",
    ", it would be interesting to characterize all matrices @xmath13 for which the partial order relation ( rather than the covering one ) is directly defined in terms of occurrences of @xmath13-vincular patterns .",
    "more precisely , it would be nice to have a characterization of those matrices @xmath13 such that @xmath57 if and only if @xmath56 .",
    "such matrices @xmath13 are those for which the structure of the @xmath13-pattern poset perfectly describes the notion of an @xmath13-vincular pattern .",
    "unfortunately , we have not been able to find such a characterization yet , so we leave it as our first open problem .",
    "we have however some partial results , which we are going to illustrate below .",
    "the first thing we observe is that in general , in the above conjectured equivalence , @xmath56 does not imply @xmath55 , nor does @xmath55 imply @xmath58 , as shown by the following two examples .",
    "_ examples .",
    "let @xmath13 be the ( lower triangular ) matrix all of whose elements are 0 , except for row 3 , which is @xmath59 . if @xmath60 and @xmath61 , then @xmath56 ( there is precisely one occurrence , in the subsequence 3456 ) , however @xmath62 ( any @xmath13-vincular pattern of @xmath1 of length 5 has to be consecutive in @xmath1 ) . notice that this example can be easily generalized to a matrix @xmath13 whose @xmath14-th row has only one 1 and all successive rows are identically 0 .",
    "if @xmath13 is such that @xmath63 and @xmath64 , then it is immediate to verify that @xmath65 and @xmath66 ; thus we have @xmath67 , but @xmath68 , since the unique occurrence is of type @xmath69 .",
    "if we restrict to the class of infinite lower triangular matrices having constant columns , we can show that one of the previous implications holds . observe",
    "that , in this case , we can completely describe @xmath13 using the ( infinite ) vector @xmath70 whose @xmath19-th component @xmath71 is the unique nonzero value appearing in column @xmath19 of @xmath13 .",
    "in particular , we modify the notations accordingly , by writing @xmath72 and @xmath73 in place of @xmath58 and @xmath55 , respectively .    if @xmath72 , then @xmath73 .    _",
    "_ proof.__fix an occurrence of @xmath2 in @xmath1 as an @xmath70-vincular pattern .",
    "let @xmath23 be the smallest consecutive pattern of @xmath1 containing such an occurrence .",
    "then @xmath74 : this follows from the more general fact that , given any matrix @xmath13 , for any consecutive pattern @xmath75 of a permutation @xmath33 , we have @xmath76 ( starting from @xmath33 , repeatedly remove either the first or the last element until getting to @xmath75 ) . to conclude the proof we now need to find a ( descending ) chain of coverings from @xmath23 to @xmath2 in the @xmath70-vincular pattern poset .",
    "to this aim , partition the elements of the fixed occurrence of @xmath2 in @xmath23 into blocks of consecutive elements of @xmath23 of maximal length , and suppose that such lengths are @xmath77 .",
    "this implies that the vector @xmath70 certainly has a 1 in positions @xmath78 .",
    "therefore we can remove the leftmost element of @xmath23 not belonging to the selected occurrence of @xmath2 , which is the @xmath79-th element of @xmath23 , thus obtaining a permutation covered by @xmath23 in the @xmath70-vincular pattern poset .",
    "we can repeat this operation until the first two blocks of @xmath2 become adjacent , thus obtaining a chain of coverings in the @xmath70-vincular pattern poset from @xmath23 down to a permutation @xmath80 .",
    "now observe that , starting from @xmath80 , we can certainly remove its leftmost element not belonging to the selected occurrence of @xmath2 to obtain a covering , since it is the @xmath81-th element of @xmath23 ( and @xmath70 has a 1 in position @xmath82 ) .",
    "this argument can be repeated , by simply observing that , each time we remove the leftmost element of a permutation of the chain not belonging to the highlighted occurrence of @xmath2 , we create a new covering in the @xmath70-vincular pattern poset .",
    "we can thus complete the chain of coverings from @xmath1 to @xmath23 to a chain of covering from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , which is what we need to conclude that @xmath83.@xmath84    however , also in this special case , the reverse implication does not hold , as the following example clarifies .    _ _",
    "example.__let @xmath85 ( that is , the vector whose unique nonzero component is the second one ) . if @xmath86 and @xmath87 , then @xmath88 , and so @xmath73 ; on the other hand , @xmath89 , since in the unique occurrence of @xmath2 in @xmath1 the first two elements are not consecutive .",
    "the reason why the above counterexample holds is essentially that in @xmath70 there is a 1 preceded by a 0 . if this does not happen , we are able to prove the following proposition .",
    "suppose that the vector @xmath70 has the first @xmath43 components equal to 1 and all the remaining components equal to 0 .",
    "then @xmath90 if and only if @xmath73 .    _",
    "_ proof.__we only need to prove that @xmath73 implies that @xmath72 .",
    "observe that , if the length of @xmath2 is @xmath91 , then the thesis becomes trivial .",
    "so , from now on , we will tacitly assume that @xmath2 is sufficiently long .",
    "we proceed by induction on the difference between the length of @xmath1 and the length of @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath2 and @xmath1 have the same length , then clearly @xmath92 . moreover , if the length of @xmath1 is one more than the length of @xmath2 , then the definitions of @xmath93 and @xmath94 coincide .",
    "now suppose that the assertion holds for pairs of permutations whose lengths differ by less than @xmath14 , and let @xmath2 and @xmath1 be permutations whose lengths differ by exactly @xmath14 . since @xmath73 , there is a chain of coverings @xmath95 .",
    "by inductive hypothesis , @xmath96 .",
    "due to our assumptions on @xmath70 , this means that there is an occurrence of @xmath97 in @xmath1 all of whose elements must appear consecutively except at most the first @xmath98 . since @xmath99 , @xmath2 is obtained from @xmath97 by removing either one of the first @xmath98 elements or the last one . in all cases ,",
    "it is easy to check that the occurrence of @xmath2 in @xmath1 thus resulting from the selected occurrence of @xmath100 in @xmath1 is made of consecutive elements of @xmath1 , except at most the first @xmath98 .",
    "this is equivalent to say that @xmath72 , as desired.@xmath84",
    "in the rest of the paper we will deal with a special case , which turns out to be particularly manageable , due to its closeness to the consecutive case .",
    "let @xmath13 be the infinite lower triangular @xmath24-matrix for which an entry is equal to 1 if and only if it belongs to the first column .",
    "so the first lines of @xmath13 are as follows :    @xmath101    since @xmath13 has constant columns , according to the notations introduced in the previous section , it corresponds to the infinite vector @xmath102 having 1 only in the first position .",
    "therefore an @xmath70-vincular pattern @xmath2 is interpreted as a dashed permutation having only one dash , which is placed between the first two elements of @xmath2 . due to the last result of the previous section , in this special case",
    ", we have that @xmath103 if and only if @xmath72 .",
    "in other words , we can assert that @xmath73 when there is an occurrence of @xmath2 in @xmath1 whose first two elements are possibly not consecutive , whereas all the remaining elements has to appear consecutively in @xmath1 .",
    "for this reason , we will say that @xmath2 is a _ quasi - consecutive pattern _ of @xmath1 , and the resulting poset will be called the _ quasi - consecutive pattern poset_. as an example , the permutation @xmath104 contains the quasi - consecutive pattern @xmath105 , since the entries @xmath106 show an occurrence of the vincular pattern @xmath107 .",
    "when a permutation @xmath1 does not contain the quasi - consecutive pattern @xmath2 , we say that @xmath1 _ avoids _ the quasi - consecutive pattern @xmath2 .",
    "for instance , the preceding permutation @xmath104 avoids the quasi - consecutive pattern @xmath108 .",
    "observe that other instances of vincular patterns with ",
    "ground permutation \" @xmath108 appear in @xmath104 ( for example , there are occurrences of both @xmath109 and @xmath110 ) .",
    "to have an idea of how intervals look like in the quasi - consecutive pattern poset , we refer the reader to subsequent figures .",
    "the quasi - consecutive pattern poset has many similarities with the consecutive pattern poset studied in @xcite .",
    "clearly it has a slightly more complicated structure , which would be interesting to investigate in detail .",
    "a first structural property of such a poset is recorded in the next proposition .    for any @xmath111",
    ", @xmath1 covers at most three permutations , which are obtained by removing either the first , the second or the last entry of @xmath1 ( and suitably rearranging the remaining ones ) .    _ _",
    "proof.__if @xmath1 has length @xmath14 , a permutation @xmath33 of length @xmath26 covered by @xmath1 can appear as an occurrence either consecutive or not .",
    "in the former case , @xmath33 has to appear either as a prefix or a suffix of @xmath1 ; thus @xmath33 is obtained by removing either the first or the last entry of @xmath1 . in the latter case ,",
    "the only possibility is that the first two entries of @xmath33 are not consecutive in @xmath1 ; thus @xmath33 is obtained from @xmath1 by removing the second entry.@xmath84    the property proved in the above proposition gives an important feature of the quasi - consecutive poset , which will be very useful in the next section .",
    "in this section , which contains the main results of our paper , we address the problem of the computation of the mbius function of the quasi - consecutive pattern poset .",
    "specifically , given @xmath112 , with @xmath113 , we want to compute @xmath114 . we will completely solve the case of a single occurrence , which turns out to be not a trivial one , and leave the general case as an open problem .    throughout this section",
    ", we will frequently write permutations with a dash between the first entry and the second entry .",
    "this is done in order to emphasize the fact that they have to be interpreted as specific vincular patterns in the quasi - consecutive pattern poset . moreover , as we already started to do in the previous paragraph , the partial order relation of the quasi - consecutive pattern poset will be denoted simply by @xmath115 ( instead of @xmath94 ) , as no other partial orders will appear from now on .",
    "we start by giving some partial results , depending on whether @xmath1 covers precisely @xmath19 permutations , for @xmath116 .",
    "recall that a _ monotone permutation _ is a permutation which is either increasing or decreasing ( so that , for any @xmath14 , the monotone permutations are simply @xmath117 and @xmath118 ) .",
