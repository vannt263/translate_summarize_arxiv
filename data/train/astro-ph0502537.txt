    "for several years , ngc  1275 at the centre of the perseus cluster held the unique distinction of being the only galaxy in a cooling flow cluster for which co emission from molecular gas had been detected ( inoue et al .",
    "1996 ; bridges & irwin  1998 and references therein ) .",
    "the fact that it is also a well - known galaxy merger ( as well as having been classified a seyfert 1 , a bl lac and an fr i radio source ) served to obscure any causal connection between the co and the cooling flow , so the failure to detect molecular gas in other such systems led to a heated debate over the validity of the cooling flow model .",
    "the latter model proposed that hot gas at the centres of relaxed clusters of galaxies was cooling out from the hot phase at rates of hundreds or thousands of solar masses per year ( fabian  1994 ) .",
    "recent developments on two separate fronts have , however , helped to bridge the impasse .",
    "firstly , x - ray data from chandra and xmm - newton show that cooling rates were vastly overestimated in the past ( e.g. schmidt , allen & fabian  2001 ) , and x - ray grating spectra also reveal a deficit of line emission from gas cooling below temperatures @xmath4 ( peterson et al .",
    "explanations for these findings include rapid mixing of hot and cold phases , inhomogeneously distributed metals in the icm ( fabian et al .",
    "2001 ,  2002 ) , agn heating by jets ( brggen & kaiser  2002 ) and sound waves ( fabian et al .",
    "2003 ) , thermal conduction ( voigt et al .",
    "2002 ) , and a significant relativistic cosmic ray component frozen into the thermal gas ( cen  2005 ) .",
    "secondly , using more sensitive receivers , edge  ( 2001 ) has detected co emission in 16 cooling flow central galaxies , consistent with @xmath5  of 2  at 40  ( see also salom & combes  2003 ) .",
    "these are roughly the masses expected , given the revised cooling rates and likely ages .",
    "interferometry shows further that the co emission is localised within the central few arcsec of the cluster ( edge & frayer 2003 ; salom & combes  2004 ) .",
    "the frequent occurrence of a much hotter molecular gas component in these systems has also been established , via near - infrared surveys of the ro - vibrational 2  lines .",
    "building on some earlier work ( elston & maloney  1992 ; jaffe & bremer  1997 ; falcke et al .",
    "1998 ; jaffe , bremer & van der werf  2001 ) , edge et al .",
    "( 2002 ) performed an h+k band spectroscopic survey of 32 line - luminous central cluster galaxies and showed that the 2  emission correlates in strength with the co and h@xmath0 emission .",

    "thus exceeds @xmath11",
    "@xmath8  k , some 23 orders of magnitude higher than that in either the diffuse x - ray or optical emission line gas .",
    "there must be a close physical connection between the h@xmath6 and optical emission line clouds , since the h@xmath6/h@xmath0 ratio is observed to be constant over 2 orders of magnitude in h@xmath0 luminosity .",
    "narrow - band hst nicmos imaging of three central cluster galaxies by donahue et al .",
    "( 2000 ) had earlier shown that the hot h@xmath6 and hydrogen recombination emission lines have similar morphologies .    following on from our spectroscopic survey in edge et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , we have begun detailed studies of individual objects to analyse the relationship between the various ionized and molecular gas systems . here",
    "we present h and k - band area spectroscopy of the centre of ngc  1275 using the uist integral field unit on the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) . from narrow - band hst observations of this target ,",
    "donahue et al .  ( 2000 ) found that the bulk of the ro - vibrational emission originates in the nuclear source , with some diffuse emission lying up to a kiloparsec away . with the uist ifu we can map this emission ,",
    "infer its excitation state and explore its possible connection to the 1.2  radius ring of co - emission found by inoue et al .",
    "area spectroscopy of ngc  1275 was published earlier by krabbe et al .",
    "( 2000 ) but at significantly lower spatial and spectral resolution and non - simultaneously in the h and k - bands .",
    "the structure of the results section of this paper is as follows .",
    "firstly , we analyse the emission line morphology in the central region and demonstrate that whilst the agn continuum is ( as expected ) unresolved , the 2  emission appears to be concentrated around @xmath12  from the nucleus . thereafter",
    ", we show that consideration of the excitation and kinematic properties of the 2  are consistent with this interpretation , and suggest that the gas is in a disk - like structure spread over radii @xmath13 .",
    "we offer further support for the model by deriving a dynamical estimate of the mass of the central supermassive black hole , and find that it is consistent with the best non - dynamical estimates in the literature .",
    "we then discuss the possible connection between this 2  disk and the co emission on larger scales .    with @xmath14  , the spatial scale in ngc  1275 ( z=0.0176 )",
    "is 358  per arcsec .",
    "the observations were performed on the nights of 2003 september 24 and 26 using the uist ifu on ukirt .",
    "the ifu provides a @xmath15  field of view and works on the image slicing principle , with the focal plane being covered by 14 ` slits ' which are aligned parallel to the long - axis of the field of view and reformatted into a single long slit at the entrance to the dispersion unit .",
    "the slits are 0.24  wide and the pixel size along the slits is 0.12 .",
    "we performed observations with two separate grisms .",
    "the first observation was taken with the short - k grism spanning 2.052.25  with a spectral resolution of @xmath16 , and we observed the target with 500 second exposures for a total of 42 minutes on source ( with the usual object - sky - sky - object nodding pattern ) .",
    "a second observation was obtained with the hk grism ( resolution @xmath17 ) , spanning 1.452.5 , with 240 second exposures for a total of 52 minutes on source .",
    "the long - axis of the ifu was oriented in an east - west direction for both observations .",
    "the observations were taken under photometric conditions with atmospheric seeing in the range 0.30.4 , which is well - matched to the spatial sampling provided by uist . for convenience , the two datasets will hereafter be referred to as the ` short - k ' and ` hk ' data , respectively .",
    "data reduction was performed offline using the uist - specific recipes within the orac - dr software ( cavanagh et al .",
    "2003 ) and comprised the usual steps of flat - fielding , sky - subtraction , wavelength calibration , division by an atmospheric standard and flux calibration .",
    "the resulting data cubes contain @xmath18 spatial elements for each of the 1024 spectral channels .",
    "they were cleaned of cosmetic defects such as hot pixels and cosmic rays by use of a median filtering process , whereby a two - dimensional kernel was passed through the cube and at each point pixels deviant from the median value by more than a certain threshold were replaced by the median .",
    "the filter was applied five times , during the course of which the replacement threshold was gradually lowered from 5@xmath19 to 2@xmath19 .",
    "subsequent cube manipulation and spectral analysis were performed with a combination of idl , iraf and qdp / pgplot .",
    "we began by deriving from the hk data cube emission line maps of 2  v=1 - 0  s(1 ) , [ feii]@xmath201.644 and pa@xmath0 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : emlines ] .",
    "they were formed by taking slices through the data cube at the wavelengths of interest and subtracting the underlying continuum by using line - free regions either side of the line and interpolating the continuum linearly across the line .",
    "the detailed spectral decomposition of the continuum by krabbe et al .",
    "( 2000 ) shows that there are no stellar absorption features in the vicinity of these emission lines , and that our continuum subtraction procedure is therefore reliable .",
    "the maps show that the emission in all three lines is heavily dominated by the nucleus , and although there is noticeably more extended emission to the west of it than to the east , the ` filament ' of 2  is the only feature that can be readily isolated .",
    "its appearance in the narrow - band 2  image in donahue et al .",
    "( 2000 ) attests to its reality .",
    "the 2  v=1 - 0  s(1 ) luminosities of this filament and the @xmath21  nuclear region are @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively . a comparison of our measurement of the 2  v=1 - 0  s(1 ) flux in the @xmath21  nuclear region ( @xmath24 ) with that measured in the central 3  by krabbe et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ( @xmath25 ) , demonstrates that there has been no variation in the 8.7 years between the two observations .",
    "the fine pixel scale of the uist ifu , coupled with the excellent seeing during the observations , allows us to examine the intensity profiles of the emission within 1  of the nucleus and to constrain the spatial locations of the emitting regions .",
    "almost 80 and 90 per cent , respectively , of the line and continuum emission in this central region falls in slits 9 and 10 , the bulk of it in slit 9 , which we refer to hereafter as the ` peak slit ' . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxes ] we show intensity profiles along the peak slit for several emission lines , with the fluxes derived from single gaussian fits to the hk data .",
    "the pointspread function ( psf ) for this slit , as derived from a reconstructed white - light image of a standard star , is also indicated .",
    "it can be seen that pa@xmath0 is unresolved , whereas the 2  and [ feii ] emission are both extended with respect to the psf",
    ".    a closer look at the 2  profile is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxmodel ] , where the fluxes were derived from double gaussian fits to the profiles from the higher spectral resolution , short - k , data cube .",
    "they show that the 2  profile  has a @xmath26 , corresponding to a psf - deconvolved @xmath27 .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxmodel ] also demonstrates ( but does not of itself prove ) that the bulk of the 2  emission out to radii @xmath28  can be accounted for by a superposition of 2 point - sources of emission , each located at a radius of approximately 0.15  from the continuum peak ( i.e. the nucleus ) , which lies between the central two pixels . in contrast ,",
    "[ fig : fluxmodel ] also demonstrates than the continuum beneath the line  dominated by agn emission in this central region  is spatially unresolved .",
    "comparison of the continuum fluxes in slits 9 and 10 ( not shown ) implies that the seeing disk of the unresolved point source is offset by @xmath29  from the centre of slit 9 , towards slit 10 .",
    "this reflects the precision with which a source can be acquired within the ifu aperture and hence also limits our determination of the psf from a single standard star observation .",
    "to summarise our analysis of the emission line morphologies , we adopt as a working hypothesis a model in which the bulk of the 2  emission arises in an extended structure located @xmath30  ( 50 ) either side of the nucleus along an east - west axis . further support for this model comes from an analysis of both the excitation and kinematics of the 2  emission , which we pursue below .",
    "( crosses ) , [ feii]@xmath201.644 ( diamonds ) , 2  v=1 - 0  s(1 ) ( triangles ) and s(2 ) ( asterisks ) .",
    "the lines show scaled psfs for this slit , determined from a standard star observation .",
    "line fluxes were derived from gaussian fits to the profiles in the hk data cube.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]      in fig .  [",

    "[ fig : emlines ] . also shown is the spectrum of the extended emission within the @xmath21  nuclear box , formed by subtracting a scaled version of the spectrum of the central 9 pixels ( scaled using a psf observation of a standard star to take account of light from the point source scattered into other pixels ) .",
    "although it falls in a region of bad atmospheric cancellation , pa@xmath0 appears to be very weak in the circumnuclear spectrum , confirming the result of fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxes ] that it is spatially unresolved .    to examine the excitation mechanism for the 2 , we begin by comparing the observed 2  line ratios with the predictions for thermal ( collisional ) excitation , which dominates in molecular gas with density @xmath31  ( the critical density of these transitions ) , heated to a few thousand kelvin by uv or x - radiation , or in shocks . under these conditions",
    ", the occupation numbers of the excited ro - vibrational levels of the 2  molecule will be in thermal equilibrium at a temperature @xmath32 equal to the kinetic temperature of the gas .",
    "therefore , for a given object , the flux @xmath33 in the @xmath34th emission line will satisfy the relation @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the wavelength of the line , and @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the spontaneous emission coefficient , energy ( expressed as a temperature ) and statistical weight of the upper level of the transition ( the latter assumes an ortho : para 2  abundance ratio of 3:1 , appropriate where collisions dominate ) .",
    "such plots were constructed for the nucleus , the circumnuclear region and the filament , and are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lte ] . for the nucleus",
    ", we see that the low - lying transitions are completely thermalised , with an excitation temperature of @xmath40 , implying a gas density above @xmath41 .",
    "the excess flux in the higher - excitation transitions may have one of three possible origins : ( a ) it could be from a much hotter thermalised gas with @xmath42  ( as deduced from a fit to the high - excitation lines only ) , close to the 2  dissociation temperature of @xmath43  ( fitting instead a two - temperature model with the excitation temperature of the hotter component fixed at 3100  implies that the cooler component has a temperature of @xmath44 ) ( b ) it could be non - thermal fluorescent emission in low density gas ; ( c ) it could be non - thermal emission due to excitation of the molecule by secondary electrons deep in the cloud .",
    "we confirm the finding of krabbe et al .",
    "( 2000 ) that on the basis of model ( a ) the v=2 - 1  s(3 ) transition with @xmath45  is underluminous by a factor of @xmath46 , explained by the fact that the upper level of this transition is de - populated by an accidental resonance with photons around the wavelength of hi ly@xmath0 at 1216  ( black & van dishoeck  1987 ) .",
    "our excitation temperature for the low excitation lines is slightly lower than that found by krabbe et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who measured @xmath47 , but our determination is more precise due to our inclusion of several 1 - 0  q series lines above 2.4 . for the higher excitation lines , krabbe et al .",
    "determined temperatures between 2600 and 2900 . for the circumnuclear and filament and circumnuclear spectra",
    ", we deduce excitation temperatures of @xmath48 , as expected for x - ray or shock - heating .",
    "given an excitation temperature , the v=1 - 0  s(1 ) fluxes can be converted to masses of hot molecular hydrogen in the following manner . for optically thin emission ( which is a valid assumption for these transitions ) , the h@xmath6 column density , @xmath49 , is related to the observed intensity of the v=1 - 0  s(1 ) emission , @xmath50 , by the expression @xmath51 , where @xmath52ps .",
    ", @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is the fraction of h@xmath6 molecules in the @xmath55 state leading to v=1 - 0  s(1 ) emission .",
    "integration over the solid angle on the sky covered by the source implies that the mass of hot h@xmath6 is given by @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the v=1 - 0  s(1 ) luminosity and @xmath58 is the mass of the h@xmath6 molecule .",
    "computation of the ro - vibrational h@xmath6 partition function at various temperatures enables us to deduce the appropriate value of @xmath54 , which varies as follows : 0.00031 ( 800 ) , 0.0049 ( 1360 ) , 0.016 ( 2200 ) , 0.023 ( 3100 ) .",
    "hence for the nucleus we deduce the following h@xmath6 masses : ( i ) @xmath59 , if all the v=1 - 0  s(1 ) is thermal emission at 1360 ; ( ii ) @xmath60  at 800  and @xmath61  at 3100 , in the aforementioned two - temperature model . for the circumnuclear and filament spectra , the masses of hot h@xmath6  at 2200  are @xmath62  and @xmath63 , respectively .    with reference to the work of maloney , hollenbach & tielens  ( 1996 )",
    "we now assess the energetic requirements for x - ray heating of the molecular gas . as discussed therein , the dominant parameter controlling the physical conditions is @xmath64 , the ratio of the x - ray energy deposition rate per particle , @xmath65 , to the gas density , n. the former is the integral over energy of @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the local photon energy flux per unit energy interval and @xmath68 the photoelectric cross - section per hydrogen atom . for an x - ray source with a power - law spectrum of photon index @xmath69 and 1100  luminosity @xmath70 , located @xmath71  from the gas cloud :    @xmath72    where @xmath73  is the equivalent neutral hydrogen column density attenuating the x - ray flux ; a column of at least @xmath74  is required in order to exclude the normal uv photon - dominated region at the cloud surface .",
    "applied to ngc  1275 , we find that :    @xmath75 - log[r_{\\rm{50}}^{2 } n_{\\rm{5 } } n_{\\rm{22}}].\\ ] ]    here @xmath76 is the x - ray luminosity of the source as seen by the cloud and @xmath77  is the x - ray luminosity of the source extrapolated ( in energy ) from the measurement by the einstein satellite in 1979  ( branduardi - raymont et al .  1981 ) , which also suggests an obscuring column @xmath78 ; @xmath79 is the gas density in units of @xmath41 , which as mentioned above must be unity or higher for thermal excitation . the modelling of maloney et al .",
    "( 1996 ) demonstrates that the bulk of the thermally excited 2  emission is produced over a fairly narrow range around @xmath80 , with the @xmath81 emissivity dropping by at least a factor of 3 when @xmath82 is more than @xmath83  dex from the emissivity peak .",
    "equation ( 2 ) therefore demonstrates that x - ray heating is an energetically feasible excitation mechanism for the observed thermal 2  emission .",
    "it is , however , difficult to make a more precise statement because of the uncertainy over the appropriate value of @xmath76 , since the light travel time from the nucleus to the clouds is @xmath84 , but observations of the source over just the last 30 years show that @xmath76 has been far from constant . from the early-1970s to the mid-1990s",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the central source has dropped steadily by a factor of 20 ( see e.g. levinson et al .",
    "1995 for a summary of the observational evidence ) .",
    "it is , however , clear that unless the agn were much weaker in the past or the gas significantly denser than @xmath85 , the hot 2  could not exist much within the observed 50  radius .",
    "similarly , equation ( 2 ) also dictates that , all other parameters being equal , thermally excited 2  emission is produced in fairly narrow range of radii , within @xmath86  dex of the peak radius , @xmath13  in this case .    in concluding this subsection",
    ", we point out that the results of maloney et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for x - ray heating assume an equilibrium state , which is established on a time - scale of @xmath87  ( set by the ionization rate of hydrogen , which has the slowest chemistry to equilibriate ) . therefore ,",
    "if the central x - ray source is varying significantly on timescales of @xmath88 or less  and observations over the last 3 decades suggest that it is  consideration of non - equilibrium chemistry may be necessary .    , and the solid line their sum . the latter accounts for the bulk of the emission in the central 0.6 .",
    "line fluxes were derived from double gaussian fits to the profiles in the short - k data ( see section 3.3 ) .",
    "the asterisks connected with the dotted line show ( with arbitrary normalization ) the continuum level below the 2  v=1 - 0 s(1 ) line : it is clearly less extended than the line emission and spatially unresolved.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]                      we turn our attention now to the kinematics of the molecular gas in the vicinity of the nucleus , as derived from the short - k data .",
    "the most striking feature , visible in the raw data , is the strong velocity shear in the peak position of the 2  v=1 - 0  s(1 ) line moving across the nucleus . to demonstrate this , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : s1lines ] line profiles on a pixel - by - pixel basis along the peak slit of the ifu , passing through the nucleus .",
    "the kinematics were quantified by fitting double gaussian profiles to the lines , with the widths of the two components constrained to be the same .",
    "the fitting of such profiles does not imply that gas of both velocities is present at each physical location in the galaxy ; rather , the weaker of the two components is simply scattered light from gas on the other side of the nucleus , in line with the model of fig .  [ fig : fluxmodel ] in which the bulk of the 2  is concentrated in two approximately point - like components 0.15  either side of the nucleus .",
    "further support for the latter model is provided by fig .",
    "[ fig : vel ] , which shows the fluxes of the fitted red and blue components in the peak slit ( slit 9 ) and also in slit 10 .",
    "we also show rotation curves for the central four slits ( i.e. slits 811 ) ; for slits 9 and 10 , the velocity being that of the brighter of the two gaussians at each location . for slits 8 and 11 ,",
    "the lines are fainter , so only a single gaussian can be fitted to these lines .",
    "the appearance of these rotation curves , with the sharp decrease in velocity amplitude in the slits either side of the nucleus suggests that the molecular gas may be in a disk - like structure , rotating about an axis oriented approximately north - south , coincident with the radio - jets .    what is the nature of this rotating 2  structure ?",
    "it is unlikely to be part of an optically - thick torus of the type commonly postulated in the centres of seyfert galaxies ( e.g. antonucci et al .",
    "1993 ) , although there is evidence for such a parsec - scale torus in ngc 1275 .",
    "firstly , the presence of a hot dust continuum in the k - band implies that some dust is heated to its sublimation temperature and thus lies as close as 0.05  to the nucleus ( krabbe et al .",
    "secondly , gas in a parsec - scale torus perpendicular to the radio jet axis is a plausible candidate for producing the observed free - free absorption towards the milliarcsec - scale northern radio counter - jet in ngc 1275 ( levinson , laor & vermeulen  1995 ) ; with reference to the latter s models , constraints since obtained on the black hole mass in ngc 1275 ( see subsection 3.5 ) suggest that the torus is comprised of individual clumps of dense gas ( @xmath89 ) and is matter - bounded in the radial direction . at larger radii , ngc 1275 has a complex dust distribution extending out to 17  kpc , in contrast to the majority of fri radio sources in which the dust is settled in disks with radii @xmath90  ( de koff et al .",
    "2000 )    a more likely possibility is that the hot 2  is part of a disk , from which we only see emission from a ring covering a narrow range of radii around 50 , due to the nature of the x - ray heating by the central source ( see section 3.2 ) .",
    "would such a disk be stable ?",
    "we consider first a gas disk , in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium in the gravitational field of a central black hole of mass @xmath91 . to ensure that the disk is stable against self - gravity we require @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is its surface mass density and @xmath94 its exponential scale - height ( this is essentially the toomre  ( 1964 ) stability criterion ) .",
    "there are two approaches to evaluating this criterion , leading ultimately to the same conclusion : ( i ) integrating vertically over the disk density profile , @xmath95 , we find @xmath96 . hence the stability criterion becomes @xmath97 .",
    "the mid - plane density , @xmath98 must be at least @xmath41  for thermal 2  excitation , and taking @xmath99  as the black hole mass  ( see section 3.5 ) , this translates into @xmath100  i.e. less than the observed radius of the 2  distribution .",
    "( ii ) assuming that the mass of hot nuclear 2  deduced in section 3.2 ( @xmath59 ) is spread over an annulus from 3570  we deduce @xmath101  kg  m@xmath102 , so re - casting the stability criterion with @xmath103  we require @xmath104 . however , from above @xmath96 , so requiring @xmath105  we deduce that @xmath106 , once again inconsistent with the stability criterion .",
    "we therefore conclude that a smooth , stable , gaseous disk of the observed radius and mass density can not exist .",
    "the propensity for 100-scale nuclear gas disks to be subject to gravitational instabilities was highlighted recently by tan & blackman  ( 2004 ) in the context of accretion onto the nuclei of giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "the disk can , however , be stabilised if the gas is located in dense clouds , as opposed to being smoothly distributed . in this case , the toomre stability criterion can be cast as @xmath107 , where @xmath19 is the 1-d velocity dispersion of the clouds and @xmath108 the orbital angular velocity .",
    "assuming @xmath109  kg  m@xmath102 as before , we hence require @xmath110ps .  for stability , which is not at all restrictive .    from the short - k data we also investigated the kinematics of the 2  filament",
    "with respect to the assumed velocity zero - point in fig .",
    "[ fig : vel ] , the 2  velocity of this gas is @xmath111 , with a de - convolved linewidth of 190  fwhm .",
    "hence , this material is unlikely to be part of the putative disk .",
    "the wavelength range of the short - k data does not contain [ feii ] or pa@xmath0 so we are unable to study the kinematics of these lines in comparable detail .",
    "in this subsection we have demonstrated that the 2  is plausibly in a disk - like structure , composed of individual clumps of dense gas since a smooth gas disk of the observed dimensions would be gravitationally unstable . because the points in the rotation curves are not mutually independent  the pixel separation along each slit is 0.12  whilst the seeing is @xmath28   we have not attempted to fit a full two - dimensional disk model to the data , since this would require a much better knowledge of the psf than we have .",
    "adaptive optics observations are needed to conclusively test the disk model in two dimensions .",
    "nevertheless , in the next section we assume that the disk model is valid and make an estimate of the black hole mass .",
    "the computation of dynamical black hole mass estimates for galactic nuclei has reached a considerable level of complexity , requiring in general observations of the full two dimensional velocity and velocity dispersion fields , knowledge of the distributed stellar mass and dynamical modelling .",
    "the resulting model of the gas kinematics must then be projected on to the plane of the sky , convolved with the instrumental response and fitted to the observational data . here",
    "we circumvent all of this complexity and compute a simple estimate of the mass enclosed within the observed radius of the molecular gas .",
    "thereafter , we use an archival hst nicmos image of ngc 1275 to estimate the stellar mass contribution in this region . the resulting black hole mass is then found to compare favourably with other non - dynamical estimates .    from the rotation curve for the nuclear slit ( slit 9 ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vel ] , we see that the 2  v=1 - 0  s(1 ) velocity jumps by approximately @xmath112  across the nucleus . if the perpendicular to the disk is inclined at an angle @xmath34 to the plane of the sky the velocity difference increases to @xmath113_i _  .",
    "our best estimate of @xmath34 derives from vlbi radio observations of the parsec - scale jets , which suggest that the radio jets are inclined to the line of sight at an angle of 3055 degrees , with the southern jet approaching us ( walker , romney & benson  1994 ) . on the assumption that the molecular gas rotation axis coincides with the radio jet axis we take @xmath114  degrees . within the inferred molecular gas radius of @xmath103",
    ", the dynamical mass is given by :    @xmath115    with @xmath116  _ i _  .",

    "values of @xmath130 are expected for stellar populations with age @xmath131  gyr for a wide range of power - law and exponential stellar initial mass functions and metallicities ( salasnich et al .",
    "2000 ) ; also , for a given population , @xmath129 will vary in the approximate range 0.053 as the population evolves , and will in general increase with age .",

    "dynamical estimates of the black hole mass are available for two other nearby central cluster galaxies , cygnus a ( @xmath143 ; tadhunter et al .",
    "2003 ) and m87 ( @xmath144 ; marconi et al .  1997 ) .",
    "ngc  1275 and m87 are both fri radio sources with virtually the same modest radio power ( @xmath145 24.6 w  m@xmath102  sr@xmath126 ) , but the large difference in their black hole masses is consistent with the scatter at low power in the large sample of @xmath146 radio galaxies in mclure et al .",
    "cygnus a , in contrast , is a powerful frii radio source ( @xmath145 27.7 w  m@xmath102  sr@xmath126 ) with a high - excitation nuclear spectrum , and falls at the high end of the @xmath147radio power correlation for such objects in the mclure et al .  sample .",

    "( 1996 ) suggests that some @xmath148  of cool 2  exists within the central arcmin of ngc 1275 , in the form of a plume extending from the nucleus to 10  west of it . within the vicinity of the nucleus , @xmath149  of this material",
    "is confined within a ring - like structure which appears on the sky as two peaks : peak 1 , 1.2  west of the nucleus , and peak 2 the same distance to the south east .",
    "the gas appears to be rotating about the nucleus with line - of - sight velocities @xmath150 , in the same sense as the 2  we have discovered on much smaller scales , suggesting a possible dynamical connection between the two gas systems .",
    "inoue et al .  ( 1996 ) suggested that the co ring could be due to gas trapped at the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) of the galaxy potential ; from poorer spatial and spectral resolution near - infrared observations they suggested that the central peak of hot 2  could be due to shock emission in a turbulent distribution of molecular clumps funnelled inwards from the co ring .",
    "in contrast , we find that the small - scale hot 2  is in a rotationally supported structure and that the nuclear radiation field is the principle source of excitation .    to further investigate the connection between the co ring and the hot 2  disk , it would be of interest to search for 2  emission coincident with the former ( which falls outside out uist ifu field of view ) .",
    "there is no 2  emission at this position in the narrow - band hst nicmos 2  image of donahue et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , suggesting that any associated emission is fainter than the 2  ` filament ' ( which they do detect ; see our fig .",
    "[ fig : emlines ] ) .",
    "this filament may represent ( possibly shocked ) material being transported from the co ring to the 2  disk : it lies at the systematic velocity ( see section 3.3 ) and has a thermal 2  excitation characteristic of shock emission ( see section 3.2 ) .",
    "we also note that the absolute velocity of co `` peak 1 '' 1.2  west of the nucleus is virtually identical to that of the hot 2  at a radius of 50  on the same side of the nucleus : on the slit 9 rotation curve of fig .  [",
    "fig : vel ] , co `` peak 1 '' would lie at an offset of @xmath151  with velocity @xmath152 . in the most naive of dynamical models",
    "this would imply that @xmath153 is the same at radii of 50  and 1.2 . integrating equation ( 5 ) ,",
    "the enclosed stellar masses within these radii are @xmath154 and @xmath155 , respectively .",
    "equality in @xmath153 can be achieved by adding a central black hole of mass @xmath156 .",
    "this shows that the black hole mass deduced from consideration of the hot 2  dynamics alone is not inconsistent with the assumption that @xmath129 is close to unity .",
    "[ fig : s1lines ]                 , with the upturn in the data below this radius being caused by non - stellar emission associated with the agn.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "for the first time , we have spatially and kinematically resolved the hot 2  in the circumnuclear region of ngc  1275 and found that it could be concentrated in a rotationally - supported structure in a narrow range of radius around 50  from the nucleus",
    ". a smaller amount of extended 2  emission exists within a few hundred  of the nucleus .",
    "x - ray heating by the active nucleus has been demonstrated to be a viable heating mechanism for the bulk of the thermally excited 2  emission , and also explains why the emission is dominated by gas within a very narrow range of radii .",
    "thanks to the fine pixel scale of the uist ifu and excellent seeing , we were able to observe a sharp shift in the velocity of the 2  v=1 - 0  s(1 ) across the nucleus and to make a simple dynamical measurement of the black hole mass , of @xmath1 .",
    "the principal uncertainty in the mass arises from the uncertainty in the true inclination of the molecular gas disk to the plane of the sky .",
    "nevertheless , the measured value is within 20 per cent of that inferred by bettoni et al .",
    "( 2003 ) from the @xmath138 relation .",
    "the 2  structure is likely to be an extension to smaller spatial scales of the coaxial 1.2-radius ring of co emission found by inoue et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , which is itself the terminus of a 10-long plume of co. this suggests that we may be directly witnessing the delivery of fuel from the galactic scale to the agn itself . as noted in section 1 , increasing numbers of cooling flow clusters appear to have large masses of co localised in the central few tens of  and smaller masses of hot 2  on even more compact scales .",
    "regardless of the precise origin of the cold gas ( be it from the cooling flow itself , or an interacting galaxy ) , the co-2  connection found here for ngc 1275 may be universally important for fuelling agn in the central galaxies of cooling flows , and hence for the regulation of heating and cooling in such cluster cores .",
    "these results demonstrate the utility of the uist ifu for high spatial and spectral resolution work of this kind , including black hole mass measurements , and promise much for the advent of similar instruments on 8-metre telescopes with adaptive optics .",
    "when coupled with sensitive co interferometry ( e.g. from alma ) it should be possible to extend these detailed studies to more distant clusters .",
