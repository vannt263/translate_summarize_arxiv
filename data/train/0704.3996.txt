    "the proof that this limit is a lattice artifact is that it increase steadily as the lattice spacing is reduced , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : strong_diff_latt_spacing ] .",
    "in contrast , the curves in fig .  [",
    "fig : strong_diff_latt_spacing_noashort ] show the case @xmath40 .",
    "these curves are like the dashed line in the right - hand plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : results2dlarge ] , where we saw late - time linear energy growth .",
    "we see here that this behavior is robust as we decrease the lattice spacing , and that @xmath132 is an adequately small spacing for our simulations .",
    "[ fig : strong_diff_volume ] shows an example of dependence on physical two - dimensional volume @xmath133 for the case of continued exponential growth .",
    "( the apparent end to exponential growth shown in this figure is the same finite - spacing lattice artifact seen in fig.[fig : strong_diff_latt_spacing ] .",
    "we see that nothing changes qualitatively as the volume is increased : the exponential growth beyond the non - perturbative scale remains . in examining the quantitative variation between the curves",
    ", one should keep in mind that it is not possible to use the same initial conditions for simulations with different volume : in addition to systematic effects , there is statistical variation reflecting the random choice of initial conditions .",
