    "control of the quantum states of trapped ions has progressed significantly over the past few years .",
    "many of the necessary requirements for quantum information processing have been demonstrated in separate experiments , such as high - fidelity state preparation , read - out , single- and two - qubit gates , and long - lived single - qubit coherence ( see e.g. ref .",
    "one of the limitations thus far in scaling to larger numbers of ions has been the lack of a suitable trap architecture .",
    "a critical benchmark for a trap design is the heating rate of an ion s motional degrees of freedom due to electric field noise from the trap electrodes .",
    "as current quantum gates rely on the coupled motion of two or more ions , noise in the motion can degrade gate fidelities  @xcite . to facilitate the determination of these heating rates , we have developed two measurement methods that have reduced hardware complexity compared to that of more traditional methods  @xcite . here , we report details of these two methods .",
    "the ion trap used for this study is a monolithic design made of gold on fused quartz , where all trap electrodes reside in a single plane  @xcite",
    ". this  surface - electrode \" geometry has the potential to greatly simplify the trap fabrication process and electrode wiring topology , thereby enabling the creation of large multiplexed trap arrays .",
    "heating rates were previously measured in a nearly identical trap by recording time - resolved fluorescence during doppler recooling after allowing the ions to heat up  @xcite .",
    "the details of this technique are examined in a recent theoretical paper  @xcite .",
    "this method was relatively simple to implement and the measured rates were promisingly low .",
    "however , the accuracy of the technique was uncertain because it relies on changes in vibrational quanta of order 10@xmath3 , whereas quantum gate fidelities can depend on changes of a single quantum .",
    "it was an open question whether the heating rates could be reliably extrapolated down to the single quantum level .    to test the accuracy of the doppler recooling method , we have built a simplified raman sideband cooling apparatus and measured heating rates of one degree of freedom in the single quantum regime .",
    "we also measured heating rates using doppler recooling under similar experimental conditions , and find reasonable agreement between the values obtained with the two techniques .",
    "in addition , heating rates were measured at several trap frequencies and the electric field noise was found to have approximately 1/f character in this particular trap . finally , although the trap discussed here was fabricated by the same process as that of ref .",
    "@xcite , the heating rates are found to be somewhat lower , possibly due to cleaner electrode surfaces  @xcite .",
    "the doppler recooling method is based on the observation that the near - resonance fluorescence rate from an ion is influenced by its motional temperature due to the doppler effect . by monitoring the fluorescence as a function of time during doppler cooling of an initially hot ion",
    ", one can determine the initial temperature of the ion averaged over many experimental runs .",
    "in the experiments discussed here , an ion is first cooled close to the doppler limit . then it is allowed to heat up for a variable amount of time ( the delay time ) by turning off the doppler cooling laser beam .",
    "the laser is turned back on and the fluorescence is monitored as a function of time until the ion s fluorescence rate reaches its steady - state value . by fitting a theoretical model  @xcite to the data , the ion s temperature at the end of the delay time can be extracted . the model is a one - dimensional semi - classical description of doppler cooling in the  weak - binding \" limit , where the ion s motional frequency is much smaller than the linewidth of the doppler cooling transition ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) . an attractive feature of this technique is its relative simplicity .",
    "it requires only one low - power red - detuned laser beam and no magnetic fields  @xcite , in contrast to the raman sideband technique discussed in section  [ sec : raman ] .",

    "the fit was constrained to pass through the origin because the ion was initially cooled near the doppler limit of a few quanta .",

    "to obtain these data , magnesium ions were created in the trap through a two - photon photoionization process using 1 to 10  mw of 285  nm laser excitation  @xcite .",
    "this ionization method was found to significantly reduce the required mg oven temperature ( and the concomitant pressure rise ) compared to electron impact ionization .",

    "by contrast , only a single laser is needed if the @xmath22 @xmath16 @xmath29 transition is used for doppler cooling , state preparation and detection ( with possibly reduced state preparation fidelity ) and if we accept relatively low raman detuning . the double - passed aoms in fig .",

    "@xmath0 m . for comparison ,",
    "all the traps plotted have approximately room temperature electrodes ; it has recently been found that cooling the electrodes can significantly reduce the heating rates  @xcite . while the fundamental heating mechanism is not understood , the predominant explanation is that the electrodes are covered in patches of varying potential that fluctuate with an unknown frequency dependence .",
    "if we assume that these fluctuating patch potentials have a size @xmath55 , then @xmath56 should scale as @xmath57 ( indicated by the gray shaded bands ) @xcite .",

    "@xcite , where @xmath53 could be varied in the same trap ( fig .",
    "[ fig : noise ] , open circles ) .",
    "concerning the frequency spectrum of the noise , if @xmath58 , then @xmath59 would of course be independent of @xmath49 .",
    "[ fig : noise ] shows several cases where the values of @xmath59 for a given trap are bunched together , indicating that @xmath60 is a better assumption than @xmath56 being independent of @xmath49 . in most traps shown",
    ", however , @xmath56 actually depends more strongly on @xmath49 .",
    "it is unclear whether this is intrinsic to the traps or due to external noise sources .",
    "as can be seen , the values of @xmath56 and @xmath59 for the nist surface trap are over an order of magnitude lower than what might be expected from the trend .",
    "the significant scatter in the data points highlights the importance of other parameters that have yet to be fully quantified , such as the microscopic properties of the electrodes ( purity , roughness , crystallinity , etc . ) , which in turn may depend on processing procedures .",
    "for example , there is some evidence that electrode contamination ( due to the ion loading process ) influences the electric field noise  @xcite . in our apparatus ,",
    "the loading geometry is such that the electrode surfaces become coated with a small amount of mg during each loading attempt .",
    "while we have not measured a systematic change in the heating rate due to loading in this trap , we can not rule out the influence of surface contamination .",
    "according to the results presented here , the simple doppler recooling technique is a reasonably accurate tool for trap characterization .",
    "it has several advantages , including simplicity and relatively small resource requirements ( a single low - power laser , no magnetic fields , etc . ) , which results in lower cost and setup time .",
    "the primary disadvantage is that delay times can be inconveniently long for low heating rates .",
    "for example , delay times of approximately one minute and averaging durations of several hours were needed for a heating rate of 300  s@xmath2 with our experimental parameters .",
    "this would be particularly troublesome if the uncooled ion lifetime in the trap ( set by background gas collisions ) were comparable to the delay time .",
    "however , weighing these factors , the doppler recooling technique may still prove useful for rapid characterization of new ion traps . means to potentially reduce the measurement time for this method are outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite .    accepting somewhat increased complexity ,",
    "a simplified raman sideband detection apparatus is shown to be suitable for heating rate measurements in the single quantum regime .",
    "using relatively small raman beam detunings ( 900  mhz ) and the same ( @xmath22 @xmath16 @xmath29 ) transition for doppler cooling , state preparation , and detection , enables a single laser to supply all necessary beams . despite reduced sideband cooling efficiency and rabi coherence , cooling of a single mode to @xmath61",
    "is achieved with significantly fewer resources than more common raman sideband detection experiments  @xcite .",
