    "symmetries play a key role in our understanding of fundamental physics . while forces originate from continuous symmetries , discrete symmetries turn out to explain many important properties of matter .",
    "the perhaps most fundamental examples are the reflection and conjugation symmetries @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , yet there are other crucial @xmath4 symmetries .",
    "examples for such symmetries include matter or @xmath5 parity in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) @xcite .",
    "matter parity ( or family reflection symmetry  @xcite ) leads to a suppression of the proton decay rate and explains the stability of the mssm dark matter candidate , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) .",
    "it can arise as a discrete 2 subgroup of a baryon - minus - lepton - number symmetry @xmath6 .",
    "one can break @xmath6 to matter parity by giving vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) to fields with @xmath7 charge @xmath8 . in @xmath9 grand unified theories ( guts ) one may switch on appropriate components of a @xmath10-plet ( see e.g.@xcite ) ; in string theory an analogous breaking pattern can be achieved  @xcite .",
    "discrete symmetries might also be an important ingredient for solving the flavor puzzle .",
    "obtaining discrete symmetries as remnants of gauge symmetries is , at a fundamental level , motivated by anomaly considerations . while discrete symmetries often are imposed ad hoc as global symmetries , it has been argued that global symmetries are violated by quantum effects unless they originate from a gauge symmetry via spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "here we focus on abelian discrete symmetries i.e.  @xmath11 groups .",
    "( for a recent discussion of how to obtain non - abelian discrete symmetries by spontaneous breaking see @xcite . )",
    "it is well known how to obtain a single @xmath11-symmetry from a 1 ; this will be reviewed below .",
    "on the other hand , the most promising candidate for a consistent theory of quantum gravity , string theory , typically provides us with models which exhibit a large rank gauge symmetry .",
    "this symmetry has to be ( spontaneously ) broken to the standard model in realistic vacua , which will generically lead to a non - trivial set of remnant discrete symmetries .",
    "the purpose of this study is to work out how such symmetries can be identified and put into a simple , i.e.canonical , form .",
    "in this section we show how to determine the remnant symmetries if we break multiple 1 factors by a set of vevs . throughout this study",
    "we shall assume the 1 charges of all fields to be integers , which implicitly fixes our conventions for charge normalization .",
    "we start with the easiest example of one 1 and two fields .",
    "consider a theory with gauge group 1 and two complex scalar fields @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . under the 1 the fields",
    "transform according to    [ eq : easy_trafo_psi ] @xmath16    with @xmath17 , i.e.  @xmath14 has charge @xmath18 and @xmath15 has charge @xmath19 .",
    "the terms @xmath20 and powers as well as products thereof are gauge invariant .",
    "suppose now that @xmath14 acquires a vev .",
    "this leaves us with effective interaction terms of the form @xmath21 with @xmath22 , dictated by the symmetry @xmath23 an equivalent way to obtain this result is stating that the remaining symmetry is determined by the condition    [ eq : baby_breaking_condition ] @xmath24 hence , @xmath25    or , equivalently , @xmath26 .",
    "we have just rederived the well known result that , by giving a vev to a field with charge @xmath18 , the 1 gets broken to a @xmath27 discrete subgroup . in what follows",
    "we will generalize this to situations in which several 1s get broken to a number of @xmath28s .",
    "let us now consider the general case of a @xmath0 gauge theory with @xmath29 scalar fields @xmath30 @xmath31 , which will acquire vevs , and @xmath32 other ` matter ' fields @xmath33 ( @xmath34 .",
    "we will denote the charge of the fields w.r.t .",
    "the @xmath35 1 factor by @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively .",
    "accordingly , the @xmath30 fields transform as @xmath38 @xmath39 can be thought of as an @xmath40-dimensional charge vector and @xmath41 as an @xmath42 charge matrix .",
    "suppose now that @xmath43 .",
    "in this case , there are unbroken 1 factors",
    ". then we can rotate the 1 directions by an orthogonal transformation such that all @xmath30 will be uncharged under @xmath44 1 factors .",
    "these 1 factors will not be affected by the vevs of the @xmath30 fields and we do not have to consider them any further .",
    "therefore , without loss of generality , we will from now on consider the case @xmath45 .",
    "notice also that in supersymmetric theories the rank of the charge matrix can not be maximal as @xmath46-flatness requires a non - trivial solution of @xmath47 with @xmath48 .    to identify the remnant discrete symmetries after spontaneous symmetry breaking ,",
    "consider the generalization of equation in our simple example ,    @xmath49    this is equivalent to @xmath50 as in , the right - hand side represents the usual ` mod conditions ' for discrete breaking .",
    "equation   can be recast in matrix notation , @xmath51    recall that @xmath52 is an @xmath42 matrix with elements in @xmath53 .",
    "such a matrix can always be brought into diagonal form by two unimodular transformations , i.e.  invertible matrices over @xmath53 . concretely , there exist @xmath54 and @xmath55 such that @xmath56 here @xmath57 means that @xmath46 is an @xmath42 matrix whose only non - zero elements @xmath58 are at the @xmath59 positions .",
    "there are @xmath40 non - zero diagonal entries due to @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath46 is called smith normal form ( or just ` normal form ' as in @xcite ) of @xmath52 .",
    "note that unimodular matrices have two important properties :    1 .",
    "they have determinant @xmath61 .. ] [ sln1 ] 2 .",
    "the greatest common divisor of all matrix elements in a single row is 1 because otherwise the determinant would not be @xmath61 .",
    "the same applies to each column .",
    "[ sln2 ]    transformation allows us to rewrite , @xmath62 now multiply this equation by @xmath63 . due to the second property of unimodular matrices , the ` mod conditions ' in equation",
    "remain unchanged , since @xmath64 still takes all values in @xmath65 if @xmath66 does .",
    "defining @xmath67 we arrive at @xmath68 hence , we see that the remnant discrete symmetry is @xmath69",
    ". if there are some @xmath70 , the corresponding factors are trivial and can be omitted .",
    "the fields @xmath33 then transform according to @xmath71 with new charges @xmath72 , which are defined modulo @xmath73 .",
    "that is , we can choose @xmath74 .",
    "let us illustrate the above procedure by an example .",
    "consider a @xmath75 theory with three fields obtaining vevs and two other fields .",
    "that is , we have @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the charges are given in table [ tab : charges ] .",
    "in this example , we only consider scalar fields , such that we do not have to worry about anomalies .",
    "later , in the applications in section  [ sec : applications ] we will discuss supersymmetric , anomaly - free settings .",
    "the charge matrix is given by the charges of the vev fields ( cf.table  [ tab : charges ]  ( a ) ) , @xmath79 the diagonal matrix @xmath46 and the transformation matrix @xmath80 are @xmath81 hence , we can read off that we are left with a @xmath82 symmetry .",
    "the charges of the @xmath83 fields can be determined by multiplying their charge matrix by @xmath80 from the right , @xmath84 the new charges of the @xmath83 fields are given by the rows of this matrix .",
    "altogether we find that the setting discussed here leads to a @xmath82 symmetry , under which @xmath85 has charge ( 1,1 ) and @xmath86 has charge ( 1,3 ) .",
    "we will now provide a simple , geometrical way of envisaging the symmetry breaking patterns .",
    "first , notice that a direct product of groups @xmath87 can be represented by an @xmath40-dimensional lattice .",
    "each element of the group can be thought of as a point in the fundamental region or unit cell of the lattice .",
    "the volume of the unit cell is the number of elements and the order of the group .",
    "let us illustrate this by the above example .",
    "the vev fields @xmath30 with charges as listed in table  [ tab : charges ]  ( a ) span the lattice . since the first vev field is an integer linear combination of the latter two , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 span a basis of the charge lattice as illustrated by the arrows in figure  [ fig : chargelattice1a ] .",
    "the matter fields @xmath83 are represented by the bullets .",
    "a coupling @xmath91 is allowed by the discrete symmetries if and only if @xmath92 lies on a node in the charge lattice , which are represented by squares .",
    "our procedure described in section  [ sec : another_example ] amounts to finding an orthogonal basis for the lattice which is given by the rows of the diagonal matrix @xmath46 .",
    "the matrix @xmath63 performs a rotation of the @xmath30 charges which eliminates linear dependencies , while @xmath80 is the transformation between the bases . in the new basis ,",
    "the lattice is orthogonal , and the @xmath83 charges are given by the projections on the basis vectors .",
    "we see that there is a @xmath82 discrete symmetry where the 2 corresponds to the horizontal and the 6 to the vertical direction in figure  [ fig : chargelattice1b ] .",
    "the matter fields have charges @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively , which are of course nothing but the coordinates of the bullets in figure  [ fig : chargelattice1b ] .",
    "note , however , that the true symmetry is smaller than that ; we will describe in section  [ sec : simplification ] how to eliminate potential redundancies .",
    "often one is interested in ` inverting ' the above procedure .",
    "instead of determining a discrete symmetry that is left after certain fields attain vevs , one would like to understand which fields need to be switched on in order to obtain a desirable discrete symmetry .",
    "examples for such symmetries include matter parity and proton hexality  @xcite .",
    "we describe now a simple algorithm for accomplishing this task .",
    "we focus on the case of a remnant 2 symmetry ; the extension to the general case is straightforward .",
    "300    start with a set ` matter ' fields @xmath83 with charge vectors @xmath95 .",
    "the @xmath95 span a lattice @xmath96 such that @xmath97 , i.e. @xmath98 and there is no coarser lattice with the same property .",
    "compute the dual lattice @xmath99 with @xmath100 .",
    "the basis vectors @xmath101 have the obvious property that @xmath102 .",
    "now try to build linear combinations @xmath103 such that @xmath104 it is obvious that one just has to scan all possible combinations with @xmath105 since an even @xmath106 will always lead to an even number on the right - hand side of .",
    "@xmath107 is then unique up to 1 generators under which all @xmath83 are neutral .",
    "given a generator @xmath107 , one has to check whether the model contains fields @xmath30 with charges of the type ` even over odd ' . if this is the case , switching on the @xmath30 fields yields configurations with a 2 symmetry under which the @xmath83 fields are odd .",
    "only the last two steps have to be slightly modified in order to obtain an arbitrary @xmath11 symmetry .",
    "in section  [ sec : stringmodelbuilding ] we will apply these methods in order to identify phenomenologically attractive string vacua .",
    "in this section we will consider a finite abelian group @xmath108 with @xmath32 fields @xmath83 , @xmath109 , transforming under @xmath110 .",
    "this setup may or may not be a result of the diagonalization procedure described in section [ sec : obtain_zs ] . here",
    "] our aim is to eliminate redundancies , i.e.  make the discrete symmetry ` as simple as possible ' .",
    "first , consider a toy example which consists of a @xmath111-symmetry with one field @xmath15 with charge 4 .",
    "this is equivalent to a @xmath112-symmetry where @xmath15 has charge 2 . in the case of one @xmath11-symmetry with fields @xmath83 and charges @xmath95 , it is easy to see if there is some redundancy in our description of the symmetry .",
    "if the greatest common divisor ( gcd ) of the @xmath95 and @xmath40 is greater than one , we can divide @xmath95 and @xmath40 by their gcd .",
    "that is precisely what happened in our above toy example .",
    "this idea of reducing the group order carries over to the general case .",
    "in addition , the method we are going to develop will bring @xmath110 into a canonical form .",
    "every finite abelian group can be written as a direct product of the form @xmath113 the @xmath58 are uniquely determined by the group and are called invariant factors .",
    "the diagonalization process described in section [ sec : obtain_zs ] always leads to this form ( cf .  equation  ) .",
    "let us look at the charge matrix @xmath114 .",
    "this is a @xmath115 matrix with integer entries .",
    "again , the idea is to calculate the smith normal form of @xmath116 .",
    "however , to get a meaningful result , we need to bring @xmath110 into the form @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the least common multiple ( lcm ) of the @xmath58 .",
    "this is because a @xmath119 discrete symmetry allows us to perform discrete rotations of the generators . enlarging the symmetry implies a rescaling of the charge matrix , @xmath120 .",
    "the fields transform now according to @xmath121 @xmath122 can be brought into smith normal form @xmath123 by unimodular transformations @xmath124 and @xmath125 , @xmath126 if @xmath127 , some @xmath128 might vanish .",
    "the corresponding rows do not have to be considered further .",
    "this yields the transformation behavior @xmath129 just like in equation ( [ ellprime ] ) , we are allowed to define @xmath130 .",
    "hence , we get @xmath131 this tells us that we have rewritten our symmetry group @xmath110 as @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the numerator of the ( reduced ) fraction @xmath134 and @xmath135 divides @xmath133 . if a @xmath133 is equal to one , this factor can be omitted .",
    "the new charges of the fields , @xmath136 , are encoded in the matrix @xmath137 , @xmath138 these charges are equivalent to the the discrete charges @xmath139 ( with @xmath140 denoting the denominator of the reduced fraction @xmath141 ) , which one immediately reads off .",
    "an obvious consequence of our discussion is that after simplification there are at most as many @xmath142 factors as fields .",
    "note that the volumes of the fundamental region of @xmath110 s lattice ( @xmath143 ) and the lattice spanned by the @xmath83 charges ( @xmath144 ) provide a necessary but not sufficient criterion for redundancies : if both possess a gcd , the size of the symmetry may be reduced by this gcd .      before discussing an example ,",
    "let us present an alternative point of view .",
    "a coupling @xmath145 is allowed by the discrete symmetry @xmath108 only if there is a vector @xmath146 such that @xmath147 with some @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "equation   can be rewritten as @xmath150 where @xmath118 denotes the lcm of the @xmath58 , as before .",
    "now we diagonalize the matrix on the left hand side of the equation , @xmath151 with the @xmath152 matrix @xmath153 , the unimodular matrices @xmath154 and @xmath155 , and @xmath156 , as before .",
    "let @xmath157 denote the rank of @xmath158 , i.e.  @xmath159 .",
    "now can be recast as @xmath160 where @xmath161 , and again @xmath140 and @xmath162 denote the numerators and denominators of the reduced fractions @xmath163 , respectively .",
    "the rank of the matrix on the left - hand side of this equation is @xmath157 .",
    "we can therefore truncate the equation , @xmath164 where @xmath165 denotes the left @xmath157 columns of @xmath137 ( such that @xmath166 is the upper @xmath167 part of @xmath168 ) , and @xmath169 .",
    "this equation is equivalent to @xmath170 comparing this equation with reveals that the rows of @xmath171 contain the charges of the @xmath83 and the @xmath162 determine the canonical symmetry .",
    "let us continue the example of section [ sec : another_example ] .",
    "after breaking both 1s we are left with a @xmath82 and a charge assignment given in table [ tab : example ] .",
    "we have to extend our symmetry to @xmath172 . the charge matrix and the smith normal form",
    "are @xmath173 the @xmath133 can be inferred from the diagonal matrix @xmath123 : they are given by 6 times the inverses of the diagonal entries , i.e.  we have @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "the numerators are hence 6 and 1 , such that we are left with a @xmath176 symmetry .",
    "the charges are given by the rows of @xmath137 ( modulo 6 ) ; since one factor is trivial we obtain that @xmath85 has charge 1 and @xmath86 has charge 3 .",
    "the visualization works as before .",
    "we extend the lattice to @xmath172 ( figure  [ fig : lattice3 ]  ( a ) )",
    ".    our simplification process amounts to identifying a direction on which both nodes lie ( figure  [ fig : lattice3 ]  ( b ) ) .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath85 sits at 1/6 of the length of the one - dimensional @xmath177 lattice , corresponding to @xmath177 charge 1 , while @xmath86 sits at @xmath178 of the length , which leads to @xmath177 charge 3 .",
    "we provide a ` mathematica ` package which automatically identifies the remnant symmetries , as discussed in section  [ sec : obtain_zs ] , and brings them to the canonical form , as described in section  [ sec : simplification ] , on our web site  @xcite .",
    "this package has been used in our applications , which will be discussed in what follows .",
    "let us now apply the above methods to model building .",
    "we focus on a specific gut model , which has been discussed in @xcite . there , an anomaly - free @xmath111 symmetry was found that may allow us to suppress proton decay in @xmath9 guts .",
    "the field content is given in table [ tab : so10_field_content ] .",
    ".field content of an @xmath9 model .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     let us remark that the 5 subgroup of this @xmath179 is redundant in the following sense : whenever a coupling is gauge invariant under @xmath180 , the coupling is also invariant under 5 .",
    "this is because 5 has a non - trivial center 5 ( cf .  the analogous discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "note also that @xmath180 invariance is the same as 5 invariance since the cartan generators are equivalent .",
    "our results imply that , if we assume that all states except the ones listed in table  [ tab : z30_charges ] attain masses , we are left with an anomalous field content .",
    "specifically , the three generations of sm matter are anomaly free , but the 6 charges of the higgs fields exhibit an anomaly ( for a discussion of discrete anomaly constraints see  @xcite ) . using discrete anomaly matching @xcite",
    "we can hence infer that the above assumption is inconsistent : either further light states have to be present , or the 6 can not be exact , i.e.  we have to introduce further fields that attain vevs .",
    "of course approximate symmetry might be sufficient for suppressing the dangerous dimension five operators , and might well be correlated with flavor hierarchies ( cf .  the discussion in  @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "our findings show that the @xmath111 symmetry introduced in the @xmath9 gut in @xcite can not give rise to proton hexality  @xcite .      as mentioned in the introduction , an exact matter parity",
    "can also be obtained in string theory by breaking a @xmath6 symmetry by two units  @xcite .",
    "this has led to a couple of vacuum configurations with an exact matter parity .",
    "yet it turns out that , with this strategy , one is not always successful : within the so - called mini - landscape @xcite of heterotic orbifolds with exact mssm spectra , vacuum configurations with an exact matter parity could only be identified in a small fraction of the models ; that is , an appropriate @xmath6 symmetry could only be identified in 15 out of 218 possible models .",
    "the obstacles encountered in this @xmath6-based approach are perhaps best illustrated in a concrete example .",
    "the model discussed in @xcite ( which later became absorbed in the mini - landscape ) does have a @xmath6 symmetry  @xcite , yet in the 4d zero mode spectrum there is no field with an even @xmath7 charge ( nor with a fractional charge of the type ` even over odd ' , which is also sufficient to provide us with matter parity  @xcite ) .",
    "gets broken by fields that do not appear in the 4d zero - mode spectrum but by states that are massless in an intermediate 6d orbifold gut picture and get projected out by going to 4d .",
    "this requires a cancellation between a kaluza - klein mass and some non - trivial vacuum expectation values of certain standard model singlets . ]    on the other hand , it is also clear that one does not really need a @xmath6 symmetry with the standard charges for the mssm matter fields .",
    "any 1 symmetry under which the matter states have odd charges , and for which there exist sm singlets with even charges , could do the job . using the methods discussed in section  [ sec : inversion ]",
    ", we were able to identify a collection of @xmath180 invariant fields @xmath30 that break the 1 factors down to matter parity in the model presented in @xcite .",
    "it is given by @xmath181 in the notation of  @xcite .",
    "our algorithm gives us a @xmath182 symmetry , however , as discussed in section  [ sec : gutmodelbuilding ] , the 5 , which is just the non - trivial center of 5 , is redundant .",
    "a quick scan indicates that in many ( if not in all ) mini - landscape models vacua with matter parity can be obtained .",
    "a detailed analysis of these issues and of the phenomenological properties of such vacua will be carried out elsewhere .",
    "we have described a simple method to determine symmetry breaking patterns which arise when @xmath0 gauge theories get broken to discrete subgroups .",
    "this method has a very simple geometrical interpretation : the fields acquiring vevs define a charge lattice .",
    "couplings @xmath183 are only allowed by the remnant discrete symmetries if the sum of the charge vectors , @xmath184 , lies on a node of the charge lattice .",
    "we have applied our methods to model building . in the context of guts , we have identified an obstacle to completely forbidding dimension five proton decay operators in certain @xmath9 guts . in string model building our methods allow us to identify novel vacuum configurations with an exact @xmath5 parity .",
