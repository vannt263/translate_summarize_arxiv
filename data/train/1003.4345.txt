    "the name _ chimera _ , which literally refers to something that is composed of seemingly incompatible or incongruous parts , was coined for this phenomenon because a group of identical oscillators splits into two groups of completely different character . since its discovery @xcite",
    ", various theoretical and numerical developments have been reported on the stability of chimera states and their existence in systems with varied structures @xcite , including time delay @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the chimera state can not be attributed to partial synchronization .",
    "the occurrence of partial synchronization in a population of non - identical oscillators is not surprising . on the other hand ,",
    "if an identical group of oscillators splits into synchronized and desynchronized groups , it is called chimera .",
    "therefore , the discovery of chimera came as a surprise in the study of synchronization phenomenon in complex systems .    by and large , synchronization in coupled oscillator systems",
    "has been analytically and numerically investigated in a rigorous manner over the past years @xcite .",
    "possible routes to global synchronization and methods to control synchronization have also been proposed @xcite . however , complete understanding of the effects induced by coupling delay in synchronization of coupled oscillator systems is still an open problem .",
    "it is well known that time delay occurs in real physical systems .",
    "for example , in a network of neuronal populations , there is certainly a significant delay in propagation of signals .",
    "in addition there can also be synaptic and dendritic delays .",
    "other examples include finite reaction times of chemicals and finite transfer times associated with the basic mechanisms that regulate gene transcription and mrna translation .",
    "the nature of coupling in coupled oscillator systems has been conventionally considered as instantaneous during earlier studies .",
    "one of the main reasons for this assumption is that it substantially simplifies the analysis of the system .",
    "in addition , such an approximation is more often physically justified . however , the fact is that the consideration of time delay is vital for modeling real life systems .",
    "furthermore , as we will demonstrate in this paper , certain interesting dynamical phenomena in complex systems are characteristic of time delay and they will not occur in systems without time delay . since the introduction of time delay increases the effective dimension of the system , one can expect certain complex phenomena to be explained in a better way in models of real physical systems when delay is included .    ) .",

    "when @xmath21 takes a constant value , the corresponding state is a stable state , and when @xmath21 varies with time , the state is either a breather or an unstable state .",
    "however , synchronization between populations and global clustering can not be characterized using these mean field parameters , since they represent average phases of the oscillators within a population . @xmath23 and @xmath24 quantify coupling delay within and between populations , respectively .",
    "a typical example of such a system is the two groups of interacting neurons in the brain such as those in the cortex ( say population 1 ) and the thalamus ( say population 2 ) @xcite .",

    "[ motiv ] , and reported briefly in @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough we found that the coupling delay induces such phenomena where the system of identical delay  coupled populations splits into desynchronized and synchronized groups .",
    "this splitting can occur either within the populations or between the populations , depending upon the value of time delay for a given set of control parameters .",
    "the former represents the chimera and the latter is the gcc , as noted earlier .",
    "further , both the chimera and the gcc states need not be stable but they can either breathe or can be unstable as will be discussed later in sec . [ breat ] .",
    "for all the numerical simulations we use runge  kutta fourth order routine with a time step of 0.01 and we have also confirmed that the results are not affected by decreasing the time step below 0.01 .",
    "all the numerical figures depicted in this article are plotted after allowing a transient time of at least 2000 units , to reduce the likelihood of the presence of transients that may be mistaken for a dynamical behaviour .",
    "actually , we have eliminated the first 2000 time steps before seeing the results and then the numerical plots are shown for small windows ( 100 or 200 time steps ) towards the end of a simulation that lasted for 30000 time units .",
    "in addition , we fix @xmath36 for numerical illustrations , although we have verified that the results are independent of the size of the system ( for some details for @xmath37 , see sec .",
    "[ breat ] , fig .",
    "[ ncheck ] , and the corresponding discussion ) .",
    "we also fix @xmath1 , where @xmath38 .",
    "this condition pertains to the logic that the coupling delay within a population is always less than the coupling delay between the populations .",
    "since we also found that the chimera and gcc states need not be stable but can breathe depending upon the value of the coupling delay ( details are given in the following sections ) , we need to characterize such breathers .",
    "the mean field ( coherence parameter ) @xmath21 quantifies synchronization within a population and therefore it can be used to quantify a breathing or unstable chimera . on the other hand ,",
    "as mentioned earlier , global clustering / synchronization can not be quantified using this order parameter .",
    "hence , in order to quantify a breathing gcc numerically , after allowing the transients , we separate out the synchronzied group from the desynchronized one . note that , both the synchronized and desynchronized groups have oscillators from both the populations .",
    "we set a condition that @xmath39 , for all @xmath40 ( here @xmath41 denotes a particular time and @xmath42 denotes discrete time steps of the numerical integration ) .",
    "the numerical equivalence for the above condition is upto 6 decimals in our calculation .",
    "those oscillators which satisfy this condition are synchronized and remain synchronized for all times and are neglected so that we end up with the desynchronized group ( that comprises oscillators from both the populations ) .",
    "while calculating the modified order parameter , we have to specify the minimum size of the synchronized group , that is we can choose how reasonably big a synchronized group can be .",
    "for example , if there are only two oscillators that have equal phases for all times , they can not be considered as a group ( given the large @xmath17 ) and hence we have to specify a minimum number of oscillators that satisfy the condition in order to be called as a synchronized group ; the rest are considered as desynchronized oscillators . in our calculations for @xmath36 and @xmath37 , we have taken this minimal value as @xmath43 .",
    "let the size of the desynchronized group be @xmath44 .",
    "now we can calculate the order parameter of this group as @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "this order parameter @xmath47 can be used to quantify both the chimera and gcc states and is also valid for cases where there exists more than one synchronized cluster .",
    "such multi - cluster states also occur for model ( [ chim_del01 ] ) which is discussed in sec .",
    "[ multi ] .",
    "thus we define a cluster by imposing the condition mentioned in the previous paragraph , and identify the number of oscillators with the same phase , say @xmath48 , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the size of cluster @xmath51 .",
    "this process can be repeated for any number of clusters and each cluster can be characterized by the order parameter @xmath52 and the mean phase @xmath53 .",

    "[ btau1 ] .",
    "the regions bounded by dot - dashed and dotted curves correspond to in - phase ( @xmath131 ) and anti - phase ( @xmath132 ) synchronization states of ( [ chim_del05a ] ) , respectively .",
    "similarly , the regions bounded by @xmath133 and @xmath134 correspond to in - phase and anti - phase synchronization states of ( [ chim_del05 ] ) .",
    "the stability boundaries between regions of the synchronized ( both global and individual ) and desynchronized states can be obtained using equations ( [ chim_del02 ] ) , ( [ chim_del04 ] ) , ( [ chim_del05a ] ) and ( [ chim_del05 ] ) . from these equations",
    "it becomes evident that the stability of the synchronized and the desynchronized states switch periodically between stable and unstable states on increasing / decreasing @xmath61 , since @xmath16 and @xmath15 are @xmath14 periodic .",
    "this also depends on the signs of @xmath9 and @xmath10 . from fig .",
    "[ btau1 ] , it is obvious that on increasing @xmath61 , the regions of synchronization and desynchronization alternate each other . the chimera / gcc states can be expected near the stability boundaries of the synchronized and desynchronized states and hence the chimera / gcc states also repeat periodically on increasing @xmath61 .",
    "this is evident from fig .",
    "[ btau1 ] where the numerical occurrence of the different chimera / gcc states , given in table [ tab1 ] ( markings 1 8 in fig .",
    "[ btau1 ] ( left ) ) and fig .",
    "[ lc1 ] ( markings 1  4 in fig .",
    "[ btau1 ] ( right ) ) are near the analytical synchronization / desychronization boundaries .",
    "note the ( bistable ) coexistence of globally synchronized state and desynchronized state ( that is marking 8 in fig .",
    "[ btau1 ] ( left ) occurs inside region i ) due to the effect of time delay .",
    "thus the stability analysis , while clearly pointing out the boundaries between synchronized and desynchronized states , also indicates the occurrence of chimera and gcc states .",
    "it is well known that synchronization is not always desirable . for example , in the brain synchronization is desirable when it supports cognition via temporal coding of information @xcite while at the same time , it is undesirable when synchronization of a mass of neuronal oscillators occurs at a particular frequency band resulting in pathologies like trauma , parkinson s tremor and so on .",
    "other examples include lasers and josephson junction arrays @xcite , emission of microwave frequencies by coupled spin torque nano - oscillators @xcite where synchronization is desirable , while in the case of epileptic seizures @xcite , parkinson s tremor @xcite , event related desynchronization @xcite , or pedestrians on the millennium bridge @xcite , it is undesirable .    in the field of neuroscience ,",
    "event - related synchronization and desynchronization of brain waves play a vital role in controlling higher level information processing , large scale integration and motor control and can be explained by models of diffusively coupled oscillators @xcite . a thalamocortical model of three populations of neurons @xcite to simulate the state of emergence from deep to light ansthesia explains that successful coding of information and consciousness ( on emergence from deep ansthesia ) is achieved by the occurrence of global synchronization between the thalamus and the cortex . in the corresponding experiment @xcite , during deep ansthesia",
    "@xmath135 waves ( frequency in the range @xmath136hz ) occur with a high amplitude in the electroencephalogram ( eeg ) .    on emergence from deep to light ansthesia the @xmath135 wave amplitude is dramatically decreased and @xmath91 ( frequency in the range @xmath137hz ) waves begin to emerge in the eeg , however with a lower amplitude compared to that of the @xmath135 waves .",
    "the model demonstrates that , during deep ansthesia , there is strong synchronization in the cortex giving rise to high amplitude @xmath135 waves . at the same time the neuronal oscillators in the thalamus are very poorly synchronized ( which is similar to a chimera state ) giving rise to very low amplitude @xmath91 waves and hence are not predominantly visible in the eeg . on emergence from deep to light ansthesia some neuronal oscillators from the cortex desynchronize ( and hence the dramatic decrease in the amplitude of @xmath135 waves ) and combine with those in the thalamus to give rise to @xmath91 waves that are not as strongly synchronized as the @xmath135 waves during deep ansthesia .",
    "this state may be considered as a state similar to a gcc state where neuronal oscillators from both the thalamus and cortex combine to form a synchronized group .",
    "the chimera and the gcc like states play a crucial role in the emergence from deep to light ansthesia and also in blocking information transfer during deep ansthesia ( so that one does not feel pain ) and for successful coding of information during light ansthesia .",
    "thus throughout the processes that take place in the brain the transmission delay in the propagation of neuronal signals causes the chimera and gcc like states to occur , that in turn facilitates the successful accomplishment of various tasks .",
    "another example prevails in the field of nanotechnology where the problem of synchronizing one or more populations of spin torque nano - oscillators at different columns to generate coherent microwave power is still open @xcite . by successfully modeling such a system using delay coupled populations of oscillators and exactly knowing where in parameter space the chimera / gcc occurs",
    ", one would be able to tune the system parameters , having the time delay parameter as the control parameter so to avoid the occurrence of a chimera / gcc .",
    "it will then be possible to stabilize the system in a state of complete synchronization .",
    "to summarize , we have demonstrated that chimera and gcc states exist in delay coupled phase oscillator populations .",
    "a system of two identical , delay  coupled populations splits into two groups , one synchronized and the other desynchronized .",
    "the state is called chimera if one of the populations is synchronized while the other is desynchronized . on the other hand , the state",
    "is called a gcc if each group has a fraction of oscillators from both the populations .",
    "we have found that these states need not be stable always but can breathe periodically , aperiodically or become unstable , depending upon the value of coupling delay . in order to characterize the stable , unstable and breathing gcc states we have introduced a modified version of the order parameter that incorporates the mean of only the desynchronized group by neglecting the synchronized group of oscillators .",
    "we also found that multi - clustered states exist as link between the chimera and gcc states , as the value of the time delay parameter is increased .",
    "we have provided analytical explanations of the observed effects on the basis of linear stability theory .",
    "based on these results , we suggest that models that incorporate time delay serve as good candidates to explain many complicated natural phenomena as opposed to models without time delay .",
    "there are various methods to control synchronization ( even its rate and velocity )",
    ". one can choose regimes of synchronization or desynchronization depending upon coupling strengths , initial distribution of frequencies , the form of the coupling functions and so on .",
    "the message of the paper is that knowledge about the occurrence of chimera , gcc and multi ",
    "cluster states will help one to achieve a good control over synchronization and desynchronization in interacting populations of neurons , spin torque nano - oscillators and similar systems .",
