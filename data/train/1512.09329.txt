    "at quark matter 2015 , star has presented results from its recently installed specialized detectors : 1 ) the heavy flavor tracker ( hft ) , which facilitates the topological reconstruction of heavy flavor hadrons  @xcite and 2 ) the muon telescope detector ( mtd ) which enables the identification of muons and consequently the study of quarkonia via the di - muon channel .",
    "the hft has enabled , for the first time , the measurement of @xmath2 azimuthal anisotropy at rhic , a measurement that will help constrain the qgp transport coefficients .",
    "the first quarknonium measurements via the di - muon channel using the mtd have also been presented .",
    "the rhic beam energy scan phase - i has recently been completed with au+au data taken at @xmath3 gev which filled the previous 100 mev gap in baryon chemical potential ( bes - i covers @xmath4 mev ) .",
    "directed , elliptic and triangular flow together with spectra , nuclear modification factors and higher - moments measurements from the full datasets of bes - i have been shown at this conference .",
    "the large masses of heavy quarks ( charm and bottom ) endow them with unique properties that make them a calibrated probe of the qgp medium created in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "their masses are larger than all the relevant medium and qcd scales ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , t ) , furthermore , their masses are mostly external to qcd , thus are not modified by their presence in the medium in a scenario where the qcd condensate melts  @xcite .",
    "their large masses also make them amenable to brownian motion theoretical - treatment in the qgp medium  @xcite .",
    "@xmath5 @xmath8 and @xmath9 are especially sensitive to the medium dynamics and thus have the potential to experimentally constrain the qgp transport coefficients  @xcite .",

    "the enhancement in the low-@xmath12 region is understood as a manifestation of charm coalescence with a flowing medium while the suppression at high-@xmath12 is , according to model calculations , an interplay of elastic collisional and radiative charm quark energy loss in the medium .",

    "<S> the solenoidal tracker at rhic ( star ) experiment utilizes its excellent mid - rapidity tracking and particle identification capabilities to study the emergent properties of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . </S>",
    "<S> the star heavy - ion program at vanishingly small baryon density is aimed to address questions about the quantitative properties of the strongly - interacting quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) matter created in high energy collisions ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , chirality , transport parameters , heavy quark diffusion coefficients ... ) . at finite baryon density , </S>",
    "<S> the questions concern the phases of nuclear matter ( the qcd phase diagram ) and the nature of the phase transition , namely : what is the onset collision energy for the formation of qgp ? </S>",
    "<S> what is the nature of phase transition in heavy - ion collisions ? </S>",
    "<S> are there two phase transition regions ? </S>",
    "<S> if yes , where is the critical point situated ? at quark matter 2015 , the star collaboration has presented a wealth of new experimental results which address these questions . in these proceedings </S>",
    "<S> i highlight a few of those results .    </S>",
