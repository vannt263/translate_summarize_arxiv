    "the following calculation shows that the flux of ionizing photons from the agn required for the derived ionization parameter at about 3  from the agn is consistent with the intrinsic luminosity of the agn from section  [ sec : agnpower ] .",

    "whether such an interpretation as a transition object can be directly transferred to low - redshift agn like with scaled - down luminosities and dominated by secular evolution remains to be investigated .    for the classical transition objects @xcite find a time lag of about @xmath119  yrs between the peak of the starburst activity and the radio - quiet agn becoming visible",
    "this is a similar delay time as the @xmath119  yrs to @xmath120  yrs found by @xcite for the minimum age of the star formation in efficiently fueled agn in nearby seyfert galaxies .",
    "@xcite discuss the role of winds and outflows from different types of stars in hindering or supporting agn accretion .",

    "<S> extended narrow - line regions ( enlrs ) and extended emission - line regions ( eelrs ) have been the focus of integral field spectroscopy aiming at the inner kiloparsecs of nearby seyfert galaxies as well as the larger environment of high redshift qsos . based on observations with the wide field spectrograph wifes at the 2.3  m telescope of the australian national university , </S>",
    "<S> we present spatially resolved emission - line diagnostics of the bright seyfert 1.5 galaxy which is drawn from a sample of the brightest seyfert galaxies at @xmath0 with luminosities around the classical seyfert / qso demarcation . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the previously known spiral arms of , the emission - line maps reveal a large scale ring with a radius of about 6  kpc which is connected to the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) through a bar - like structure . </S>",
    "<S> the overall gas kinematics indicates a disk rotation pattern . </S>",
    "<S> the emission - line ratios show seyfert - type , region - type , and composite classifications , while there is no strong evidence of liner - type ratios . </S>",
    "<S> shock ionization is likely to be negligible throughout the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the composite line ratios are explained via a mixing line between agn and region photoionization . </S>",
    "<S> composite line ratios are predominantly found in between the regions in the circum - nuclear region , the bar - like structure to the east of the nucleus , and the eastern half of the ring , suggesting agn photoionization of the low - density interstellar medium in an enlr on galaxy scales . </S>",
    "<S> the line ratios in the nucleus indicate n - enrichment , which is discussed in terms of chemical enrichment by wolf - rayet and asymptotic giant branch stars during past and ongoing nuclear starburst activity . </S>"
