    "the experimental development is accompanied by an increasing theoretical interest in the transport properties of such systems.@xcite an intriguing challenge presents the possibility to control the tunneling current through the molecule .",
    "typical energy scales in molecules are in the optical and the infrared regime , where today s laser technology provides a wealth of coherent light sources .",
    "hence , lasers represent an inherent possibility to control atoms or molecules and to direct currents through them .",
    "a widely studied phenomenon in extended , strongly driven driven systems is the so - termed ratchet effect,@xcite originally discovered and investigated for overdamped classical brownian motion in periodic nonequilibrium systems in the absence of reflection symmetry .",
    "counterintuitively to the second law of thermodynamics , one then observes a directed transport although all acting forces possess no net bias . this effect has been established as well within the regime of dissipative , incoherent quantum brownian motion .",
    "@xcite a related effect is found in the overdamped limit of dissipative tunneling in tight - binding lattices . here the spatial symmetry is typically preserved and the nonvanishing transport is brought about by harmonic mixing of a driving field that includes higher harmonics.@xcite for overdamped brownian motion , both phenomena can be understood in terms of breaking a generalized reflection symmetry.@xcite    recent theoretical descriptions of molecular conductivity are based on a scattering approach.@xcite alternatively , one can assume that the underlying transport mechanism is an electron transfer reaction and that the conductivity can be derived from the corresponding reaction rate.@xcite this analogy leads to a connection between electron transfer rates in a donor - acceptor system and conduction in the same system when operating as a molecular wire between two metal leads.@xcite within the high - temperature limit , the electron transport on the wire can be described by inelastic hopping events.@xcite for a more quantitative _ ab initio _ analysis , the molecular orbitals may be taken from electronic structure calculations.@xcite    isolated atoms and molecules in strong oscillating fields have been widely studied within a floquet formalism @xcite and many corresponding theoretical techniques have been developped in that area .",
    "this suggests the procedure followed in ref .  : making use of these floquet tools , a formalism for the transport through time - dependent quantum systems has been derived that combines floquet theory for a driven molecule with the many - particle description of transport through a system that is coupled to ideal leads .",
    "this approach is devised much in the spirit of the floquet - markov theory @xcite for driven dissipative quantum systems .",
    "it assumes that the molecular orbitals that are relevant for the transport are weakly coupled to the contacts , so that the transport characteristics are dominated by the molecule itself .",
    "yet , this treatment goes beyond the usual rotating - wave approximation as frequently employed , such as e.g.  in refs .  .",
    "a time - dependent perturbative approach to the problem of driven molecular wires has recently been described by tikhonov _ _ et al.__@xcite however , their one - electron treatment of this essentially inelastic transmission process can not handle consistently the electronic populations on the leads .",

    "for example , in the case of a large driving amplitude , one can treat the static part of the hamiltonian as a perturbation.@xcite the floquet states of the oscillating part of the hamiltonian then form an adapted basis set for a subsequently more efficient numerical diagonalization .",

    "we note that from a computational viewpoint there is no need to employ a rwa since within the present approach the numerically costly part is the computation of the floquet states rather than the solution of the master equation .",

    "the consequence for the floquet states is the symmetry relation ( [ app : phitp ] ) which reads for a tight - binding system @xmath136 inserting this into the current formulae ( [ dc_current_l ] ) and ( [ dc_current_r ] ) would yield , if @xmath76 were real , again the balance condition ( [ balance ] ) and , thus , a vanishing average current . however , the @xmath76 are in general only real for @xmath137 , i.e.  for very weak coupling such that the condition ( [ rwa_condition ] ) for the applicability of the rotating - wave approximation holds .",

    "we have investigated the possibility to rectify with a molecular wire an oscillating external force brought about by laser radiation , thereby inducing a non - vanishing average current without any net bias . a general requirement for this effect",
    "is the absence of any reflection symmetry , even in a generalized sense . a most significant difference between `` true '' ratchets and molecular wires studied here is that the latter lack the strict spatial periodicity owing to their finite length .",
    "however , as demonstrated above , already relatively short wires that consist of approximately 5 to 10 units can mimic the behavior of an infinite ratchet .",
    "if the wire is even shorter , we find under certain conditions a current reversal as a function of the wire length , i.e.   even the sign of the current may change .",
    "this demonstrates that the physics of a coherent quantum ratchet is richer than the one of its units , i.e.  the combination of coherently coupled wire units , the driving , and the dissipation resulting from the coupling to leads bears new intriguing effects .",

    ", its eigenfunctions @xmath182 can be divided into two classes : even and odd ones , according to the sign in @xmath183 .    adding a periodically time - dependent dipole force @xmath184 to such a hamiltonian evidently breaks parity symmetry since @xmath185 changes the sign of the interaction with the radiation . in a floquet description , however , we deal with states that are functions of both position and time  we work in the extended space @xmath186 . instead of the stationary schrdinger equation , we address the eigenvalue problem @xmath187 with the so - called floquet hamiltonian given by @xmath188 where we assume a symmetric static part , @xmath189 .",
    "our aim is now to generalize the notion of parity to the extended space @xmath186 such that the overall transformation leaves the floquet equation ( [ floquet_app ] ) invariant .",
    "this can be achieved if the shape of the driving @xmath108 is such that an additional time transformation `` repairs '' the acquired minus sign .",
    "we consider two types of transformation : generalized parity and time - reversal parity . both occur for purely harmonic driving , @xmath190 . in the following two sections",
    "we derive their consequences for the fourier coefficients @xmath191 of a floquet states @xmath192 .",
    "it has been noted @xcite that a floquet hamiltonian of the form ( [ h+xf ] ) with @xmath190 may possess degenerate quasienergies due to its symmetry under the so - called generalized parity transformation @xmath193 which consists of spatial parity plus a time shift by half a driving period . this symmetry is present in the floquet hamiltonian ( [ h+xf ] ) , if the driving field obeys @xmath122 , since then @xmath194 leaves the floquet equation invariant .",
    "owing to @xmath195 , we find that the corresponding floquet states are either even or odd , @xmath196 .",
    "consequently , the fourier coefficients ( [ fourier ] ) obey the relation @xmath197      a further symmetry is found if @xmath198 is an odd function of time , @xmath123 .",
    "then , time inversion transforms the floquet hamiltonian ( [ h+xf ] ) into its complex conjugate so that the corresponding symmetry is given by the anti - linear transformation @xmath199 this transformation represents a further generalization of the parity @xmath200 ; we will refer to it as _ time - inversion parity _ since in the literature the term generalized parity is mostly used in the context of the transformation ( [ app : s_gp ] ) .",
    "let us now assume that that the floquet hamiltonian is invariant under the transformation ( [ app : s_tp ] ) , @xmath201 , and that @xmath192 is a floquet state , i.e. , a solution of the eigenvalue equation ( [ floquet_app ] ) with quasienergy @xmath47 .",
    "then , @xmath202 is also a floquet state with the same quasienergy . in the absence of any degeneracy",
    ", both floquet states must be identical and , thus , we find as a consequence of the time - inversion parity @xmath203 that @xmath204 .",
    "this is not nessecarily the case in the presence of degeneracies , but then we are able to choose linear combinations of the ( degenerate ) floquet states which fulfill the same symmetry relation .",
    "again we are interested in the fourier decomposition  ( [ fourier ] ) and obtain @xmath205    the time - inversion discussed here can be generalized by an additional time - shift to read @xmath206 . then , we find by the same line of argumentation that @xmath207 and @xmath208 differ at most by a phase factor .",
