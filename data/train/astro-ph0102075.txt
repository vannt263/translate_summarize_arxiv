    "their coverage consists mostly of single pointings a few nights apart , in order to follow the long - term lightcurve , which showed the source to fade from v=16.72 to around 18.5 , 1 and 3 weeks after the start of the x - ray decline .",
    "a later observation on june 27 failed to detect the source , corresponding to @xmath320.5 .",
    "they also obtained short @xmath4-band sequences on three nights , but only amounting to @xmath10.25 , @xmath11.0 and @xmath11.2 cycles of the 2 h period respectively . from these sparse data they concluded that there was evidence for a 0.06 mag semi - amplitude modulation at the 2 h x - ray period , with phasing such",
    "that the minimum occurs when the companion lies between the observer and pulsar .    in order to place further limits on the secondary",
    ", we obtained the first high time - resolution ccd photometry of the counterpart in quiescence , using the 1.9 m telescope at the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) , and it is these results that we present in this paper .",
    "observations of a small ( @xmath5 arcsecs ) region surrounding the optical counterpart to  were made using the uct - ccd fast photometer ( odonoghue 1995 ) , at the cassegrain focus of the 1.9 m telescope at saao , sutherland on 1999 august 10 and 2000 july 3 .",
    "the uct - ccd fast photometer is a wright camera 576@xmath6420 coated gec ccd which was used here half - masked so as to operate in frame transfer mode , allowing exposures of as short as 2s with no dead - time .",
    "however , given the faintness of the quiescent counterpart we employed much longer integration times . in 1999 , we concentrated on obtaining a high signal - to - noise lightcurve , and therefore we opted for a continuous time - series of 30s white light ( no filter ) exposures . in 2000",
    ", we were again favoured with good seeing and stable photometric conditions initially , so we attempted to obtain colour information on the binary modulation . in fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] we show a deep ( 52 min exposure ) @xmath7 band finding chart , constructed from the 13 shifted and co - added images from the interval of best seeing during these observations .",
    "this demonstrates the difficulties in obtaining good photometry of this faint target , as it is quite severely crowded ; only with good seeing , @xmath8 ( indeed truly excellent for this telescope ) is there any possibility of resolving the counterpart from its near neighbour .",
    "however , the seeing did deteriorate and become more variable towards the end of the run . in this instance , we cycled through @xmath9 filters , with typical exposure times of 240 , 180 , 150s in each respectively .",
    "for the 2 h period , this still yields approximately 0.1 phase resolution .",
    "we performed data reduction using iraf , including photometry with the implementation of daophot ii ( stetson 1987 ) .",
    "point spread function ( psf ) fitting was always employed , as it is essential for obtaining the best possible photometry , in such crowded conditions .",
    "the details of this procedure are given in homer , charles & odonoghue ( 1998 ) .",
    "lastly , in order to reduce systematic effects differential photometry was applied , wherein the magnitudes of a star are calculated relative to an ensemble of local standards ( bright , non - variable stars ) .",
    "for the 1999 august 10 white light observations no strict calibration is possible .",
    "however , if we assume that the unfiltered passband of the ccd corresponds roughly to @xmath4 , we may use observations of the e - region standard e752 @xcite to estimate that the counterpart had @xmath10 on that date , consistent with the limit of given the uncertainties .    for the sets of colour images from 2000 , we use the standard star e508 ( chosen for its similar colours , and comparable airmass when observed ) , and aperture photometry to derive the calibrated magnitudes of local standard stars within the small field of the ccd ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : image ] ) .",
    "finally , the magnitude of the target is calculated from its differential magnitude with respect to these local standards , these measurements necessarily making use of psf fitting .",
    "we find @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 all uncorrected for reddening .",
    "the magnitude errors quoted arise largely from counting statistics as the target is simply so faint , together with uncertainties in the transformation between aperture and psf magnitudes . compared to its colours during outburst @xcite of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath16 cf .",
    "@xmath17 ; apart from being 5 magnitudes fainter , they are consistent within the uncertainties , agreeing with the unchanging @xmath18 values found by during the decline itself .    furthermore , in order to facilitate other comparisons we may attempt to correct for interstellar extinction towards .",
    "we utilize the column density estimated from _ rxte _",
    "x - ray spectral fits by to set an upper limit , and the galactic value in the direction of  for the lower limit @xcite , to derive @xmath19 . applying the relations @xmath20 @xcite , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 ,",
    "we may estimate corrected colours of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",

    ".quiescent optical properties of v4580 sagittarius/[tab : optprop ] [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the detection of a plausibly phased two hour modulation confirms our identification of the correct counterpart , v4580 sagittarius , in both sets of observations .",
    "however , we have noted that its x - ray to optical luminosity ratio is very small , which implies that it is surprisingly optically bright , especially given the expected very faint emission from any secondary capable of fitting into the roche lobe of the 2 hr orbit ( see below ) .",
    "the possibility that the true quiescent amplitude is much larger than in outburst , allowing for another line - of - sight star , responsible for some of the flux we have measured , can nevertheless be ruled out by the morphology , which is not flat - bottomed but sinusoidal ( cf .",
    "the case of psr 1957 + 20 , ) . we shall now seek to apply some constraints as to the source of the quiescent optical emission , given the available information , although we are limited by the large uncertainties in the absolute magnitude and colours of v4580 sgr ( due to the poorly constrained column ) .",
    "firstly , are we simply seeing the companion star and nothing else ? argue that the most probable companion is an extremely low mass star ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "however , if this lies on the main sequence the expected @xmath27 implies a brightness that is 5 magnitudes fainter than our observed limit . on the other hand",
    ", we might postulate a more massive ( 0.50.8 ) companion , such as a k1 to m0 main sequence dwarf , which would have the correct magnitude .",
    "but this is also not tenable .",
    "the counterpart is much too blue for such a spectral type ( @xmath28 cf . a k1 star value of 0.86 )",
    ". the inferred inclination would be extremely low ( @xmath29 ) and therefore improbable , since the _ a priori _ probability of seeing a system with @xmath30 or less goes as @xmath31 .",
    "further compelling evidence is the lack of ellipsoidal variations . if any modulation is to be seen from the light of the companion star alone ( as is the case for a number of other soft x - ray transients in quiescence )",
    ", then its period should be half that of the binary .",
    "hence , we may conclude that no `` ordinary '' lower ms star provides all the optical emission .",
    "the other possible source of optical emission is a combination of : ( i ) a remnant accretion disc , ( ii ) a hotter irradiated accretion disc , ( iii ) the irradiated face of the companion star . in order to make an approximate quantitative comparison with our data we have undertaken some simplified modelling to obtain predicted broad band spectra . for the details of the modelling see ,  4.3 ( accretion disc ) , and the appendix ( heated face of companion star ) .",
    "the resulting spectra are presented in figure  [ fig : spec.05 ] .    assuming that an accretion disc is still present , how bright will it be solely due to internal viscous energy release ? here",
    "we make use of the results of the @xmath32 disc prescription , using a nominal but reasonable value of @xmath32=0.1 , and a canonical 1.4@xmath33 mass for the neutron star .",
    "the inner disc radius is set at the co - rotation radius assuming a keplerian disc and the outer at 9/10 of the primary s roche lobe .",
    "we may estimate the mass transfer rate assuming that the low mass secondary continues to fill its roche lobe ( requiring either / both an evolved or / and an x - ray irradiation - bloated state ) , and that the process is solely driven by angular momentum loss due to gravitational radiation ( gr ; ): @xmath34",
    "this is also consistent with the time - averaged value based on the energy released during outbursts ( e.g. 1998 april , total fluence@xmath35 ; ) along with their @xmath120 month recurrence cycle .",
    "the spectrum is plotted as the dotted line in the figure . with a measured value for @xmath36 from pulse timing",
    ", the value of @xmath37 we choose immediately constrains the inclination angle @xmath30 . for a 0.05@xmath33 secondary",
    ", we find a moderately high inclination @xmath38 ( 50% _ a priori _ probability of detection ) , and the model curve is consistent with the lower limits on the optical fluxes , and has the correct blue slope ( although @xmath39 could well be slightly higher than we used ) .",
    "for any higher inclination both the gr - driven mass transfer rate decreases ( as the square ) and the projected disc size ( as @xmath40 ) , making such a system too faint compared to our observations . on the other hand , for more massive secondaries the inclination must be lower and hence so will the _ a priori _ probability of seeing such an inclined system , ignoring any selection effects .    depending on the system inclination a variety of mechanisms can lead to a periodic modulation of the optical flux on the binary period . in the case of",
    ", the lack of an x - ray eclipse requires @xmath41 , whilst we have seen it is more likely to be lower still , @xmath42 . in this range low amplitude ( at most a few percent )",
    "_ sinusoidal _ modulations are seen in many lmxbs , which are presumed to arise due to the varying contribution from the x - ray heated face of the secondary as its aspect changes . within this framework",
    "the measured amplitude of modulation enables us to estimate the level of irradiating flux required to be @xmath43 .",
    "admittedly , this luminosity is a factor of ten higher than that of the two quiescent x - ray observations of but probably still consistent , given the degree of variability seen in other quiescent sources ( e.g. cen x-4 ; ) .",
    "we note that this too argues against lower inclinations , as the amplitude will decrease along with the relative contribution of the heated face , and a greater degree of irradiation is not possible .",
    "interestingly , the trend in amplitude fits that implied by the data , decreasing towards the blue , which is a consequence of the cooler variable companion star component .",
    "we have undertaken the first time - series ccd photometry of v4580 sagittarius , the optical counterpart to , in quiescence .",
    "we find that it has dropped to @xmath0 , five magnitudes from the peak of the 1998 outburst , although its colours are the same within the uncertainties .",
    "furthermore , as during outburst it exhibits a clear 2hr sinusoidal modulation with a @xmath16% semi - amplitude , and is at a minimum when the pulsar lies behind the companion .",
    "our @xmath9 photometry reveals a possible trend in amplitude , increasing with wavelength .",
    "lastly , a comparison of its x - ray to optical flux ratios in outburst and quiescence shows that if reprocessing of the observed x - ray flux is the dominant mechanism in outburst , this can not apply in quiescence , as it is relatively optically over - bright .",
    "an analysis of these results has led us to conclude that :    * unlike other soft x - ray transients in quiescence , the intrinsic emission of the companion star is not the dominant contribution to its optical flux ( as evidenced by the lack of ellipsoidal variations ) . *",
    "if we assume that a low level of mass transfer ( driven by gravitational radiation losses ) continues , then the disc emission due to internal viscous energy release is the main source of the observed optical flux .",
    "however , the observed x - ray luminosity requires that this mass is _ not _ being accreted onto the neutron star . *",
    "the observed sinusoidal binary modulation is most consistent with a geometrical ( i.e. , aspect change ) origin , wherein the face of the secondary is irradiated by the quiescent x - ray flux , and makes a variable contribution to the optical flux .",
    "clearly , with the existing data we have only been able to infer many of the physical details of the system and further observational effort on the quiescent counterpart is still needed .",
