    "the loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) @xcite , @xcite ( a recent review ) is mainly the application to homogeneous spacetimes of the quantization methods of loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) @xcite , a non - perturbative and background independent canonical quantization of general relativity .",
    "a central result of the theory is that the singular evolution encountered in the wheeler - de  witt theory no longer appears @xcite .",
    "this is commonly interpreted as the replacement of the big bang singularity by a bounce .",
    "that result is a strong motivation to obtain quantitative predictions from lqc as a cosmological scenario .",
    "since a complete quantum solution is not available at present , a constructive means to obtain some insights of the consequences of the phase close to the bounce is that of using effective equations @xcite . in such equations ,",
    "the effects induced by the quantum nature of the geometry are taken into account through corrective terms in classical equations . in isotropic flat models ( which are the only models considered here ) two main corrections",
    "are used  : the `` inverse volume correction '' which comes from the spectra of the quantum operator related to inverse triads , and the `` holonomy correction '' coming from the quantization scheme in which holonomy of the connection are basic variables .",
    "the relative importance of the two type of corrections is still under discussion , it is then usual to consider their effect separately . in the present work we focus on holonomy corrections and",
    "more specifically on the possible effects of the super - inflationary phase ( in which the hubble factor is growing ) @xcite on the tensor modes of the power spectrum of the cmb .",
    "a number of study have already been devoted to tensor mode in lqc @xcite .",
    "recently , effect of the big bounce on the b - modes of the cmb has been considered @xcite ( see also @xcite for a different approach ) , where the matter content of the universe was taken into account through a massive scalar field . in the present work we modelize the content of the universe during the phase of super - inflation using the simple equation of state @xmath0 , for which the modified friedmann equation admits solutions in closed form for some relevant values of the constant @xmath1 .",
    "we show that during the super - inflation that equation of state for a massless scalar field ( @xmath2 ) is a very good approximation to the massive scalar field in a fast roll regime ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "we compute in both cases ( massless scalar and fast rolling massive scalar ) the power spectrum after the phase of super - inflation including the holonomy corrections .",
    "we then estimate the b - modes and discuss the sensitivity of the spectrum to the model considered .    in sec .",
    "[ secdynamics ] we describe the dynamics the of a fluid governed by a simple equation of state @xmath0 .",
    "we study how this equation compares with that of a massive scalar during the super - inflationary phase .",
    "the primordial and b - mode power spectra for the case @xmath2 are determined and discussed and compared to the standard inflationary prediction in sec .",
    "[ secpowerspectra ] . except otherwise stated , the geometric units @xmath4 are used throughout the paper .",
    "we assume that the dynamics of the universe is described by the lqc modified friedmann equation @xcite :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the so - called critical density .",
    "the modified friedmann equation ( [ eqfriedmannmod ] ) captures the ultraviolet corrections arising from the discrete quantum geometric effects .",
    "in particular , we see that when @xmath8 the theory departs drastically from general relativity : the hubble parameter vanishes , and the universe experiences a turnaround in the scale factor .",
    "the big bang singularity is therefore avoided and replaced by a big bounce .",
    "the critical density can be expressed as a function of the so - called barbero - immirizi parameter @xmath9 @xcite :    @xmath10    combining ( [ eqfriedmannmod ] ) with the derivative of the continuity equation @xmath11 leads to @xmath12 which shows that for @xmath13 the hubble factor increases between the bounce ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath14 .",
    "this is the phase of super - inflation .    as for most non linear equations , it is often impossible to find an exact solution of the modified friedmann equation .",
    "however , with the generic equation of state @xmath0 , which , using the equation for the energy conservation , translates in @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are constants and @xmath18 is the scale factor , the modified friedmann equation becomes    @xmath19    this equation can be solved literally for certain values of x , in particular for @xmath20 ( inflation or cosmological constant ) , @xmath21 ( unknown fluid ) , @xmath22 ( ultra - relativistic matter ) and also ( not so easily ) for @xmath23 ( massless scalar field ) .",
    "the boundary condition for the modified friedmann equation is given at the bounce , where the density reaches the critical density .",
    "thus @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is ( chosen to be ) the first eigenvalue of the scale factor which , according to @xcite , is : @xmath26 note that , we can also determine thanks to ( [ eqdotafromfriedmanandstate ] ) the value of the scale factor at the end of super - inflation ( @xmath27 ) for @xmath28 : @xmath29 thus , the number of e - folds of super - inflation is simply given by : @xmath30 it is then clear that for @xmath31 super - inflation alone wo nt give a decent amount of efolds .    in order to compare with the the case of a single massive scalar field one can rewrite the equation of state for the scalar field under the form @xmath32 with @xmath1 and thus @xmath33 time dependant . since the evolution of the scalar field is as usual governed by the klein - gordon equation @xmath34    by restricting the study to the case where the backreaction is negligible @xcite , one can solve numerically this equation together with the modified friedmann eq .",
    "( [ eqfriedmannmod ] ) to obtain the field @xmath35 .",
    "then , from the expression of the pressure and the density of a scalar field , namely @xmath36 one obtains @xmath37 which is here a function of the time which depends on two physical parameters : @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "it is pictured in fig .",
    "[ x(t ) ] .",
    "the evolution of @xmath40 shows three main phases : a pre - inflationary phase ( @xmath41 ) during which @xmath42 , an intermediate phase ( @xmath43 ) during which @xmath40 decreases and finally a phase of slow - roll inflation .",
    "the length of the pre - inflationary phase is related to the value of @xmath44 : if the potential energy at the bounce is small , it will take longer to reach a slow rolling regime . during this pre - inflationary phase the dynamic of the massive scalar field",
    "can be approximated by the simple fluid @xmath45 with @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "such an equation of state corresponds to a massless scalar field .",
    "a more accurate description of this phase can be obtained with a fast rolling scalar field , i.e. such that @xmath3 , with equation of state @xmath48 . in what follows",
    "we will study these two approximations .",
    "note that the time @xmath49 at which the super - inflation ends is easily determined from @xmath50 ( fig .",
    "[ rho(t ) ] ) thanks to the relation @xmath51 .",
    "one observes that the super - inflation represents a very small fraction of the pre - inflationary phase .     for @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "]     for @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the horizontal dashed line represents the value at which super - inflation ends .",
    "here super - inflation lasts a bit more than 0.1 and thus @xmath54 times less than the phase with @xmath42 . ]",
    "let us now turn to the tensor modes . from the considerations of the previous paragraph",
    ", one can assume that the matter is described by a scalar and then consider the two approximations ( massless and fast roll ) for the pre - inflationary phase . in order to obtain the power spectra of the perturbations",
    ", we have to solve the equation of propagation of the tensor modes , which can be written as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the holonomy correction @xcite @xmath57 thanks to ( [ xdephi ] ) , @xmath58 can be written as function of x : @xmath59 and thus @xmath60 we now determine the two quantities @xmath56 and @xmath61 for each approximation : free massless and fast rolling scalar .      the modified friedmann equation can be written as :    @xmath62    its solution is then :    @xmath63    where @xmath64 is a constant determined by the initial conditions . at @xmath65 , one gets    @xmath66    which implies that @xmath67 . the conformal time is then given by    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is a hypergeometric function",
    ".    one can compute the terms of the propagation equation :    @xmath70    and    @xmath71      for a fast rolling scalar field ( @xmath72 ) , the friedman ( [ eqfriedmannmod ] ) and klein gordon ( [ kg ] ) equations reduce to :    @xmath73    @xmath74    thus @xmath75 whose solution is    @xmath76    where @xmath77 is a constant fixed by the initial conditions . at @xmath65 , @xmath78 and",
    "so one gets    @xmath79    which implies that @xmath80 . using the friedman equation",
    ", one can then derive the hubble parameter :    @xmath81    and since @xmath82 , the scale parameter is :    @xmath83    as in the previous case , the conformal time takes the form    @xmath84    we can compute the terms of the propagation equation :    @xmath85    and    @xmath86    which are , contrary to the conformal time , slighty different from those obtained for the massless scalar field .",
    "let us consider the power spectra of the super - inflation alone . for both our modelisations ,",
    "the equation of propagation of the tensor modes admits no exact solution and was thus solved numerically using a runge - kutta method .",
    "the power spectra could then be expressed as :      where @xmath88 corresponds to the end of the pre - inflationary phase ( @xmath89 , see fig .",
    "[ x(t ) ] ) .",
    "thus , we are not only computing the pertubations produced during super - inflation but also those emerging from the intermediate phase that takes place just before the slow - roll regime .    in both cases ( fig .",
    "[ x=6 ] and [ fastroll ] ) , the slope at large scales grows like @xmath90 and the spectra begin to oscillate very slightly around @xmath91 .",
    "the minor differences between the two spectra can be ignored ( see fig .",
    "[ x=6_fs ] ) as they would be undistinguishable at the scale of the cmb .",
    "we therefore conclude that a simple massless scalar field is suitable to describe the perturbations produced by super - inflation .            to obtain the power spectrum corresponding to the total primordial epoch we have to connect the perturbations that arise from the pre - inflationary phase to a phase of standard slow - roll inflation . to this end",
    "we assume that we neglect the perturbations produced during the transition between the two main phases .",
    "we also consider that the quantum corrections are negligible during inflation since @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "the perturbations produced during inflation thus take the usual form      where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are constants and @xmath96 and @xmath97 hankel functions of the first and second kind . at the end of the first phase",
    ", we impose the continuity of the perturbations and of their first derivative :      we can then produce the power spectrum of @xmath99 at the `` end '' of inflation ( so that the whole phase would yield 70 e - foldings ) . as in the case of pre - inflationary phase alone , the power spectra ( fig .",
    "[ big9 ] and [ big11 ] ) still behave like @xmath90 at large scales . for large k the spectra are nearly scale invariant as one would expect with inflation .",
    "some oscillations appear between those two regimes . lowering the value of the parameter",
    "@xmath44 increases the amplitude of these oscillations which thus appear as the consequence of the bounce . as seen in sec .",
    "[ secdynamics ] , decreasing @xmath44 increases the length of the pre - inflationary phase , thus giving more time to the holonomy correction to modify the spectrum of perturbations .          since we have computed the power spectrum of the tensor perturbations , we are now able to produce the primordial part of the b - mode angular power spectrum of polarization of the cmb",
    ". we do not know the modification of the spectrum of scalar perturbations produced by the holonomy correction , we will thus assume that scalar perturbations are given by the usual nearly scale invariant spectrum .",
    "this will allow us to produce the part of the spectrum that emerges from the conversion from e - modes to b - modes through lensing .",
    "moreover , the holonomy correction is an ultraviolet correction while the lensed part of the bb angular spectrum is supposed to dominate mostly at small angular scales .",
    "the b - mode power spectra are obtained using camb @xcite . for the cosmological parameters , we took those given for @xmath104 by wmap+bao+h0 @xcite .",
    "as input for the primordial power spectrum we used a simple parametrization of the previous spectrum inspired by @xcite @xmath105 the parameters @xmath106 and @xmath107 respectively determine the position and amplitude of the transition between two regimes ( fig . [ param ] ) : @xmath108 at large scale and the spectrum is scale invariant at lower scales .",
    "the transition between those two regimes presents a bump .",
    "we will not take into account the oscillations of the primordial spectrum in the rest of the computation and only focus on the envelope .",
    "the parameter @xmath107 is closely related to the parameter @xmath44 : high values of @xmath107 correspond to small values of the potential energy of the scalar field at the bounce .",
    "the link between the phenomenological parameter @xmath106 and the physical parameters is less simple since the position of the bump depends on both @xmath44 and the length of the slow - roll phase .",
    "the resulting b - mode power spectra are presented as a function of the parameter @xmath106 in fig .",
    "[ bb-1 ] and [ bb-2 ] with tensor - scalar ratios of @xmath109 and @xmath110 respectively . at large multipole ,",
    "the spectra are dominated by the contribution of the lensing as in the usual scenario and are thus independant of @xmath106 .",
    "however , the spectra also reach a maximum in two regions : at large angular scales ( @xmath111 ) for @xmath112 and at intermediate scales ( @xmath113 ) for values of @xmath106 around @xmath110 .",
    "the latter case is the most interesting from an observational point of view since it coincides with the beginning of the observationnal window of ground based experiments like bicep @xcite .",
    "an important question is whether future experiments would be able to discriminate between b - modes produced by inflation and b - modes arising from a bouncing cosmology in the framework of lqc .",
    "a global analysis on all multipoles of a similar model was performed in @xcite using a fisher analysis method to determine the detectability of the bump of the primordial spectrum of gravitational waves . here",
    "we will take a complementary point of view , we will determine the multipoles where the b - modes arising from lqc can be distinguished from those produced by a standard inflationary scenario . in fig .",
    "[ bb-1i ] and [ bb-2i ] are presented the b - mode power spectra divided by the standard inflationary prediction as a function of the parameter @xmath106 with tensor - scalar ratios of @xmath109 and @xmath110 respectively . due to the contribution of the lensing ,",
    "the lqc and inflationary spectra are identical at small angular scales . however , for multipoles smaller than @xmath115 the lqc spectra show significant departures from the standard inflationary prediction for identical tensor - scalar ratios in the two regions described previously . for @xmath114 , which corresponds to the primordial spectrum of fig .",
    "[ big9 ] with @xmath53 , those departures can reach two orders of magnitude for @xmath116 .",
    "the corresponding angular power spectra are presented in fig .",
    "[ bbn1 ] and [ bbn2 ] . in the following",
    "we will only focus on spectra obtained for @xmath117 since it corresponds to the region of the parameter space where the models can be most easily distinguished .",

    "the @xmath118 confidence upper limits on the detection of b - modes of polarization given by bicep @xcite are also pictured.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    for high values of @xmath107 the spectra are very different from the inflationary spectra as they possess a peak around @xmath120 which should allow to discriminate between the models .",
    "in fact in the case of a tensor - scalar ratio @xmath121 of @xmath109 , a large region of phase space is even already excluded by the bicep data @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ bbn1 ] ) . for smaller tensor - scalar ratios like @xmath122 only high values of @xmath107",
    "are excluded by the data . for smaller values of @xmath107 and",
    "thus for higher values of @xmath44 the spectra come closer to the inflationary prediction in the observable range ( @xmath123 ) , especially for low values of the tensor - scalar ratio .",
    "nevertheless , the importance of the backreaction @xcite grows as @xmath44 gets bigger and the effective model of lqc that we are using here is no more valid .",
    "therefore our conclusions only concern relatively large values of r.    the situation changes as the tensor - scalar ratio decreases and the inflationary and lqc spectra might be indistinguishable . in fig .",
    "[ bbn3 ] not only is the gap between the inflationary and lqc spectra for @xmath124 much smaller than in the @xmath125 or @xmath126 cases but the lqc spectrum for @xmath124 also yields the same b - modes as inflation with @xmath125 in the observable range ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "this arises from the fact that the lqc spectra no longer possess a peak at low tensor - scalar ratios but a plateau around @xmath120 which is similar to the one present in the inflationary spectrum .",
    "the b - modes of polarization produced in the frame work of lqc should thus be distinguishable in the observable range of multipoles from the inflationary prediction for low values of the potential energy at the bounce and for moderate tensor - scalar ratios .",
    "therefore , future satellite and ground - based experiments should either be able to discriminate between lqc and inflation or to strongly constrain the effective model of lqc used in this study .",
