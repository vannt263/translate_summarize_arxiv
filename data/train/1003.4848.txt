    "in magnetic systems with a two dimensional triangular lattice , magnetic frustration may occur depending on the nature of the magnetic interactions and the orbitals involved .",
    "the case of linio@xmath0 , where ni@xmath1 has half filled @xmath2 orbitals , has been studied for a long time both experimentally and theoretically @xcite .",
    "recent progress on the understanding of the orbital and magnetic properties of this compound has been achieved thanks to an appropriate control of the non stoichiometry or doping effects since no pure samples are available .",
    "indeed magnetic ni@xmath3 ions are substituted between the triangular planes on the li sites creating new magnetic exchange paths .",
    "it has been shown that li@xmath4ni@xmath5o@xmath0 with x=0.01 does not show long range magnetic order .",
    "rather , a fluctuating state develops which is slowed down when mg doping is introduced and no interplane ni@xmath3 are presents @xcite .",
    "when li is deintercalated , in li@xmath6nio@xmath0 , short range incommensurate antiferromagnetic order is observed for z=3/4 and 2/3 @xcite .",
    "as for the orbital part , several experimental works are in favor of the @xmath7 orbital occupancy for the @xmath2 electrons with finite range order @xcite or dynamical effects @xcite .",
    "such an occupancy is indeed observed unambiguously in the parent compound nanio@xmath0 , which seems to behave more classically .",
    "it orders ferro orbitally below @xmath8  k @xcite and antiferro magnetically below @xmath9  k @xcite .",
    "we present here the first single crystal study of its magnetic phase diagram up to @xmath9  t using torque measurements .",
    "we show that several spin reorientations occur as a function of temperature or magnetic field with unusual magnetic anisotropy .",
    "nanio@xmath0 crystallises in the r-3 m space group and , below the ferro orbital ordering temperature , becomes monoclinic ( c2/m ) with @xmath10=5.3087   , @xmath11=2.8413   , @xmath12=5.5670   , and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the two dimensional triangular network of ni@xmath1 becomes then distorted to accommodate the collective elongation of the oxygen octahedra surrounding the ni ions ( figure [ structure ] ) . at room temperature , the distorted triangles are described by two angles at 56.3@xmath14 and 61.8@xmath14 and two ni - ni distances at 2.84  and 3.01   . from one triangular plane to the other , the ni - ni distance is 5.47   .",
    "the antiferromagnetic ground state observed below @xmath15 is of the a type with a ferromagnetic alinement of the ni spins in the triangular plane and an antiferromagnetic alinement from one plane to the other .",

    "the curie weiss behavior of the magnetic susceptibility above 100k leads to ferromagnetic dominant interactions with a curie weiss temperature @xmath16=+36  k. below the ordering temperature ( @xmath15=20 k ) , application of a magnetic field reveals a spin flop transition at @xmath17=1.8  t @xcite fort=4  k and another transition at @xmath18=8  t @xcite .",
    "spin wave measurements agree with an easy plane a type antiferromagnet model although there are some discrepancies between the inelastic neutron measurements @xcite and the electron spin resonance measurements @xcite . in this model , @xmath19 describes the strength of the antiferromagnetic coupling between the ni planes .",

    "nanio@xmath0 single crystals have been grown by molten hydroxide flux method . the flux composition was naoh and koh , a ni crucible played the role of ni source . in a preliminary step ,",
    "61.6@xmath21 of a naoh - koh mixture ( molar ratio 1:2 ) was melted in a separate ni crucible at 400@xmath14c .",
    "the molten mixture was then poured in another 40@xmath22 ni crucible and placed in a preheated open vertical furnace .",
    "the experiment was carried out at 650@xmath14c .",
    "the evaporation of the naoh - koh mixture at the liquid surface induces a local saturation , then nucleation and crystal growth .",
    "runs were stopped once an abundant `` crust '' was observed covering the flux surface ( typically after 12 hours ) .",
    "the crystals were easily separated from the flux with water in an ultrasonic bath .",
    "they often take the shape of hexagonal small platelets ( figure [ crystal ] ) .",
    "the crystals were characterized using scanning electron microscopy equipped with edx analysis ( relative content : na : 0.49 , ni : 0.51 ) . a mixture of crystals were crushed and studied by powder x - ray diffraction : only stoichiometric nanio@xmath0 was identified .",
    "most of the crystals are twinned in the @xmath23 plane so that the crystal platelets contain three kinds of domains with an average @xmath24 direction perpendicular to the platelets plane which coincides with the ni planes .",

    "inserts : derivative of the torque.,width=321 ]    a sample with a magnetic moment @xmath25 placed in a magnetic field @xmath26 will experience a torque @xmath27 that can be measured using a cantilever ( see figure [ crystal ] ) .",
    "one of the larger crystals was selected ( typically 1 @xmath28 x 1 @xmath28 x 0.2 @xmath28 ) and glued on a copper - beryllium cantilever with general electric varnish .",
    "care was taken to avoid contact with air and moisture .",
    "the large face of the crystal containing the ni planes was parallel to the cantilever @xmath29 plane so that the @xmath30 axis coincides with the crystal @xmath24 axis ( see figure [ crystal ] ) .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath31 lies in the @xmath32 plane , making an angle @xmath16 with the @xmath30 axis .",
    "the cantilever could rotate as regards the magnetic field so that @xmath16 could be varied from 0@xmath14 to 90@xmath14 .",
    "the capacitive technique allows the measurement of the torque produced in the @xmath33 direction : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the sample magnetic moment .",
    "it is reduced to @xmath36 when the sample magnetic moment has a linear dependence on magnetic field .",
    "@xmath37 is the difference of the magnetic susceptibility parallel and perpendicular to the @xmath30 axis ; @xmath38 is the spin direction in absence of torque . when the magnetization is saturated , the torque should vanish except for @xmath39 factor anisotropy effects , which should be negligible compared to @xmath37 effects in the ordered magnetic phase .",
    "the expected torque for @xmath40 using the easy plane model with the small anisotropy described above is given in figure [ torque](a ) , assuming that the @xmath30 direction coincides with the spin direction . in the experiment ,",
    "there is a 10@xmath14 difference .",
    "because of the crystal twinning , the @xmath33 and @xmath41 direction are not crystallographically well defined .",
    "this means that the measurement gives the average of @xmath42 and @xmath43 . in these calculations ,",
    "the torque has a quadratic dependence on the magnetic field with a change of sign and magnitude at the spin flop field ( @xmath17=1.8  t ) and vanishes at either @xmath20 or @xmath19 .",
    "we expect then to observe three different regimes labelled ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) in figure [ torque](a ) .",
    "the measured data are reproduced in figure [ torque](b ) .",
    "four different regimes are observed and no saturation . regime ( 1 ) has the expected quadratic field dependence and can be identified as regime ( a ) .",
    "it disappears at @xmath20 to enter regime ( 2 ) with a change of slope , both in sign and magnitude as expected for regime ( b ) .",
    "this transition is widen , probably due to thermal effects . regime ( b ) is in fact divided in two parts , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , with similar magnetic field dependencies .",
    "note that the quadratic field dependence for these regimes does not extrapolate to zero as calculated in regime ( b ) but rather there is an internal torque which has different values for regime ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "this unexpected zero field torque can exists if the extrapolated zero field magnetization is not zero ( in a canted antiferromagnet for instance ) or there exist local fields that are not collinear with the sample magnetization ( dipolar fields due to twinning or other anisotropic fields due to crystal field effects for instance ) .",
    "the presence of two regimes instead of one suggests that there is a change in the anisotropy fields , i.e. a spin reorientation .",
    "the higher field regime observed , regime ( 4 ) , does not saturate at all contrary to what has been calculated for regime ( c ) .",
    "rather , it has the following field dependence : @xmath44 with @xmath45 = 20  t. the torque starts to decrease only above @xmath46 , which introduces another critical field in the magnetic phase diagram of nanio@xmath0 .",
    "there is an internal torque in this regime as in regime ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) with a different value .",
    "note that these internal torques do not exist at zero field since the corresponding magnetic phases exist only at higher field .",
    "a domain pattern would have developed to compensate it and have the crystal at rest .",
    "crystal at different field values , width=321 ]    we have investigated more deeply each regime looking at their dependence on the magnetic field orientation ( see figure [ torqueang ] ) .",
    "the low field regime , regime ( 1 ) , does not follow at all the expected @xmath47 law .",
    "rather , it behaves as @xmath48 with a periodicity of 110@xmath14 .",
    "the origin of such a weird periodicity remains unclear .",
    "the presence of an incommensurate magnetic phase is to ruled out since neutron diffraction data at zero field are unambiguously fitted within a commensurate magnetic structure .",
    "on the other hand , 110@xmath14 is exactly the monoclinic @xmath49 angle of the crystal structure .",
    "macroscopic effects linked to twinning are then probably responsible but difficult to evaluate due to the low symmetry of the system .",
    "note that the critical field at which this regime disappears has the following angular dependence : @xmath50 with @xmath17=1.7  t in agreement with previous measurements @xcite .",
    "the free spin direction is at @xmath51 in agreement with the neutron diffraction data @xcite .",
    "+ regime ( 3 ) has the correct angular dependence : @xmath52 with @xmath38 close to @xmath53 . regime ( 2 ) seems intermediate between regime ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) with a constant evolution of the angular periodicity .    the critical fields @xmath54 and @xmath55 at which regime ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) disappear follow the same angular dependence : @xmath56 with @xmath57=5.1  t , @xmath58=7.4  t , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "this confirms the spin reorientation process from regime ( 2 ) to ( 3 ) .",
    "@xmath55 is in agreement with the powder data ( @xcite ) while @xmath54 was not detected previously .",
    "+ finally , regime ( 4 ) follow the @xmath47 law with @xmath38 close to @xmath53 .",
    "we have checked that the field dependence remains the same for all angles , with a constant value for @xmath45 around 20  t.     as a function of temperature , the red line is an exponential fit.,width=321 ]",
    "these torque measurements on a twinned crystal reveal that the nanio@xmath0 system presents several spin reorientations , and very unusual magnetic anisotropies depending on magnetic field .",
    "the modelization is quite complex due to the low crystal symmetry of the compound ( monoclinic unit cell ) and the presence of 3 types of twins .",
    "nevertheless , we can establish a magnetic phase diagram using these torque measurements at different temperatures ( see figure [ torquet ] ) .",
    "as the ordering temperature is approached , regime ( 1 ) disappears together while regime ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) merge into another regime . note that the torque diminishes as the temperature increases but has still a non vanishing field dependence .",
    "we checked that it behaves as @xmath36 and noticed that @xmath37 decreases exponentially with an activation energy exactly equals to the curie weiss temperature + 36  k ( see insert of figure [ torquet ] ) .",
    "one concludes that there is a magnetic anisotropy induced by the exchange energy .",
    "it is responsible for the high field torque observed at low temperature which tends to vanish only above @xmath46 .",
    "we can now establish the magnetic phase diagram .",
    "we have plotted in figure [ diagram ] the critical fields obtained in this work as well as in previous studies mainly on powder samples @xcite except for the first magnetization measurements which were taken on a twinned crystal up to 3  t @xcite . at low temperature ,",
    "5 phases are present : phase ( 1 ) where the spin lies at 10@xmath14 from the ni plane , phases ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) with different spin orientations , and finally phases ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) which are close to full saturation .",
    "phases ( 1),(2 ) and ( 3 ) disappear at @xmath61 but a cross over line persists above .",
    "this phase diagram was obtained when the magnetic field was at 10@xmath14 from the @xmath30 axis .",
    "all the boundary lines correspond , to a good approximation , to the phase diagram when the magnetic field lies in the free spin direction",
    "i.e. -10@xmath14 for phase ( 1 ) , + 30@xmath14 for phase ( 3 ) , except for the transition between phase ( 4 ) and ( 0 ) where the border line shifts to lower temperatures when @xmath16 is changed , in agreement with the specific heat data on a powdered sample @xcite where a quasi vertical line is observed .",
    "while most of the phase diagram was already established , we have shown , using torque measurements on a crystal , that two additional phases are present at low temperature , phases ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) . the transition line to phase ( 5 ) , @xmath62 , is obtained from the fit of the torque field variations . since it is not a direct experimental measurement ,",
    "its uncertainty is wider than for @xmath20 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "note that @xmath63 corresponds to an energy for the s=1/2 ni@xmath1 spin of the order of 20  k , the same order of magnitude as the observed anisotropy activation energy and curie - weiss temperature of 36  k. as for the transition lines @xmath64 and @xmath65 , which are quite close , it is tempting to identify them with the two zero field modes at 6.5  @xmath66 and 9.0  @xmath66 observed in the electron spin resonance measurements on a powdered sample at 4  k@xcite .",
    "the associated magnetic fields can be matched to @xmath54 and @xmath55 assuming a gyromagnetic factor @xmath67=2.6 , in reasonable agreement with the observed @xmath39 value at 200  k : @xmath68=2.03 and @xmath69=2.28 .",
    "this suggests that both @xmath54 and @xmath70 are associated with the same crystallographic plane as @xmath69 ( perpendicular to the elongation axis of the oxygen octahedra ) .",
    "note also that the presence of these two modes at 6.5  @xmath66 and 9.0  @xmath66 can not be explained in an easy plane a type antiferromagnetic model with only two magnetization sublattices @xcite .",
    "the inadequacy of this model is confirmed by our torque measurements in regime ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) where an internal torque has to be added to the model .     from crystal torque measurements obtained at @xmath71 , heat capacity ( @xcite)and magnetization ( @xcite ) measurements.,width=321 ]",
    "the magnetic study of a millimeter size nanio@xmath0 crystal was achieved successfully using torque measurements .",
    "we have established the presence of 5 different ordered phases with different spin orientations and magnetic anisotropies .",
    "the corresponding critical magnetic fields are 1.8  t , 5.1  t , 7.4  t and @xmath7220  t at 4  k. these reflect the presence of several characteristic energies in the system at around 2.5  k,7.5  k , 11  k and 30  k. a more complex behavior is observed than a simple easy plane a type antiferromagnet with probably different possible magnetic ground states quite close in energy"
