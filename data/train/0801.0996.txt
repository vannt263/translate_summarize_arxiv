    "+ + + + + + + + +    this paper is concerned with efficient , structure - preserving time integrators for mechanical systems whose configuration space is a lie group based on the hamilton - pontryagin ( hp ) variational principle @xcite .",
    "this hp principle has many attractive theoretical properties ; for instance , how it handles degenerate lagrangian systems .",
    "the present paper paper shows that the hp viewpoint also provides a practical way to design discrete lagrangians , which are the cornerstone of variational integration theory .",
    "this overview explains the central idea of this paper in the context of vector spaces and shows how this idea extends to lie groups .",
    "the hp principle states that a mechanical system traverses a path that extremizes the following hp action integral : @xmath0 the integrand of the hp action integral consists of two terms : the lagrangian and a kinematic constraint paired with a lagrange multiplier ( the momentum ) .",
    "the kinematic constraint relates the mechanical system s velocity to a curve on the tangent bundle . in this principle ,",
    "the curves @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 are all varied independently .",
    "if @xmath4 is varied first , it collapses to the _ usual hamilton principle_. if , on the other hand , @xmath2 is varied first it defines the ( negative of the ) hamiltonian as the extrema of the terms involving @xmath5 and then the principle reduces to _ hamilton s phase space principle_. this hp form of the action integral makes it amenable to discretization .",
    "in particular , one can implement an @xmath6-stage runge - kutta ( rk ) discretization of the kinematic constraint and enforce this discretization as a constraint in a discrete action sum .",
    "the motivation is that the theory , order conditions , and implementation of such methods , are mature . for this purpose",
    "let @xmath7 $ ] and @xmath8 be given , and define the fixed step size @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath6 be the number of stages in the rk method . in analogy with the continuous system",
    ", the discrete hp action sum takes the following form : @xmath12 it consists of two parts : a weighted sum of the lagrangian using the weights from the butcher tableau of the rk scheme , and pairings between discrete internal and external stage lagrange multipliers and the discretized kinematic constraint .",
    "this strategy yields a lagrangian analog of a well - known class of symplectic partitioned runge - kutta methods including the lobatto iiia - iiib pair which generalize to higher - order accuracy @xcite .    in the lie group context",
    ", one can generalize this strategy using either constrained or generalized coordinates . to use constrained",
    "coordinates one treats the system as a holonomically constrained mechanical system . in this approach",
    "one assumes that @xmath13 can be written as the level set of some function @xmath14 , embeds @xmath13 in a larger linear space , and uses lagrange multipliers to enforce the constraint .",
    "this approach is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the corresponding constrained action takes the following form : @xmath15   \\text{.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the present paper a second approach based on generalized coordinates is presented .",
    "first the paper introduces the following left - trivialized action : @xmath16 then an equivalence is established between critical points of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "if the lagrangian is left - invariant , it is shown that this principle unifies the system s lie - poisson and euler - poincar descriptions @xcite .",
    "since the reconstruction equation is a differential equation on a lie group , one can not directly discretize it by an rk method .",
    "however , one can discretize it using an @xmath6-stage runge - kutta - munthe - kaas ( rkmk ) method @xcite .",
    "the integral of the left - trivialized lagrangian is approximated using a weighted sum given by the @xmath19-vector in the butcher tableau of the rkmk scheme .",
    "this approach is shown to yield a novel class of variational partitioned runge - kutta ( vprk ) methods on lie groups ; including generalizations of symplectic euler and strmer - verlet methods on flat spaces .",
    "in the next paragraphs we will give some background material for the reader s convenience as well as to put the paper into context .",
    "* variational integrators .",
    "* variational integration theory derives integrators for mechanical systems from discrete variational principles .",
    "the theory includes discrete analogs of the lagrangian , noether s theorem , the euler - lagrange equations , and the legendre transform .",
    "variational integrators can readily incorporate holonomic constraints ( via lagrange multipliers or the discrete null - space method ; @xcite ) and non - conservative effects ( via their virtual work ) @xcite , as well as discrete optimal control ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "altogether , this description of mechanics stands as a self - contained theory of mechanics akin to hamiltonian , lagrangian or newtonian mechanics .",
    "one of the distinguishing features of variational integrators is their ability to compute statistical properties of mechanical systems , such as in computing poincar sections , the instantaneous temperature of a system , etc .",
    "for example , as a consequence of their variational design , variational integrators are symplectic .",
    "a single - step integrator applied to a mechanical system is called _ symplectic _ if the discrete flow map it defines exactly preserves the canonical symplectic 2-form and is otherwise called standard . using backward error analysis",
    "one can show that symplectic integrators applied to hamiltonian systems nearly preserve the energy of the continuous mechanical system for exponentially long periods of time and that the modified equations are also hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "standard integrators often introduce spurious dynamics in long - time simulations , e.g. , artificially corrupt chaotic invariant sets is well  illustrated in a computation from @xcite , namely of a poincar section of an underwater vehicle in fig .",
    "[ fig : uv ] using a fourth - order accurate runge - kutta ( rk4 ) method and a variational euler ( ve ) method designed for rigid - body type systems .    .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    in addition to correctly computing chaotic invariant sets and long - time excellent energy behavior , evidence is mounting that variational integrators correctly compute other statistical quantities in long - time simulations .",
    "for example , in a simulation of a coupled spring - mass lattice , @xcite found that variational integrators correctly compute the time - averaged instantaneous temperature ( mean kinetic energy over all particles ) over long - time intervals , whereas standard methods ( even a higher - order accurate one ) exhibit a artificial drift in this statistical quantity .",
    "these structure - preserving properties of variational integrators motivated their extension to stochastic hamiltonian systems .",

    "there are several different strategies available to derive structure - preserving lie group integrators ; some of these are discussed here .",
    "one strategy involves the so - called lie - newmark method due to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these methods were motivated by the need to develop conserving algorithms that efficiently simulate the structural dynamics of rods and shells .",
    "for example , the configuration space of a discrete , three - dimensional finite - strain rod model , would involve @xmath8 copies of @xmath21 where @xmath8 is the number of points in the discretization of the line of centroids of the rod . for each point on the line of centroids ,",
    "the orientation of the rod at that point is specified by an element of @xmath22 . in such models",
    "the mathematical description of the rotational degrees of freedom at these points is equivalent to the ep description of a free rigid body with added nonconservative effects due to the elastic coupling between points .",
    "it was not apparent that the proposed lie - newmark methods had the necessary structure - preserving properties .",
    "in fact , simo & wong proposed another set of algorithms which preserve momentum by using the coadjoint action on @xmath22 to advance the flow .",
    "such integrators will be referred to as _ coadjoint - preserving methods_. later , @xcite showed that the midpoint rule member of the lie - newmark family with a cayley reconstruction procedure was , in fact , a coadjoint - preserving method for @xmath22 .",
    "they also numerically demonstrated the method s good performance crediting it to third - order accuracy in the discrete approximation to the lie - poisson structure .",
    "in related work , @xcite construct reduced , coadjoint - orbit preserving integrators by reducing @xmath13-equivariant integrators on @xmath23 obtained by embedding @xmath13 in a linear space using holonomic constraints .",
    "coadjoint and energy preserving methods of the simo & wong type that further preserve the symplectic structure were developed for @xmath22 by @xcite .",
    "this was done by defining a one - parameter family of coadjoint and energy - preserving algorithms of the simo & wong type in which the free parameter is a functional .",
    "the function was specified so that the resulting map defined a transformation which preserves the continuous symplectic form .",
    "endowing coadjoint methods with energy - preserving properties was also the subject of @xcite .",
    "specifically , they introduced integrators of the runge - kutta munthe - kaas type that preserved coadjoint orbits and energy using the coadjoint action on @xmath22 and a numerical estimate of the gradient of the hamiltonian .",
    "variational integration techniques have been used to derive structure - preserving integrators on lie groups ; see @xcite .",
    "moser and veselov derived a variational integrator for the free rigid body by embedding @xmath22 in the linear space of @xmath24 matrices , @xmath25 , and using lagrange multipliers to constrain the matrices to @xmath22 .",
    "this procedure was subsequently generalized to lagrangian systems on more general configuration manifolds by the introduction of a discrete hamilton s principle on the larger linear space with holonomic constraints to constrain to the configuration manifold in @xcite .",
    "they also considered the specific example of deriving a variational integrator for the free rigid body on the lie group @xmath26 by embedding @xmath26 into @xmath27 and using a holonomic constraint .",
    "the constraint ensured that the configuration update remained on the space of unit quaternions ( a lie group ) and was enforced using a lagrange multiplier .",
    "another approach is to use _ reduction _ to derive variational integrators on _ reduced spaces_. @xcite developed a discrete analog of ep reduction theory from which one could design _ reduced _ numerical algorithms .",
    "they did this by constructing a discrete lagrangian on @xmath28 that inherited the @xmath13-symmetry of the continuous lagrangian , and restricting it to the reduced space @xmath29 . using this discrete reduced lagrangian and a discrete ep ( dep ) principle , they derived dep algorithms on the discrete reduced space .",
    "[ acro : dep ] they also considered using generalized coordinates to parametrize this discrete reduced space , specifically the exponential map from the lie algebra to the lie group . these techniques were applied to bodies with attitude - dependent potentials , discrete optimal control of rigid bodies , and to higher - order accuracy in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite considered a more general case where the symmetry group is a subgroup of the lie group @xmath13 in the context of semidirect euler - poincar theory ( see @xcite ) .",
    "they did this by writing down the discrete euler lagrange equations for this system and left - trivializing them .",
    "for the case when the symmetry group is @xmath13 itself , one recovers the dep algorithm as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite used this theory to determine and analyze an elegant , integrable discretization of the lagrange top .",
    "the perspective in this paper on lie group variational integrators is different . recognizing that euler s equations for a rigid body are in fact decoupled from the dynamics on the lie group , and more generally , that the ep equation is decoupled from the dynamics on the lie group , the paper aims to develop discrete variational schemes that analogously consist of a reconstruction rule and discrete ep equations that can be solved independently of the reconstruction equation and on a lower dimensional linear space . as mentioned in the overview the central idea is to discretize the reduced hp principle .",
