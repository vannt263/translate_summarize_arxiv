    "one of the most significant development in the past decades is the discovery of a new particle with mass of approximately 125 gev , which was announced by the atlas and cms collaborations at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) in 2012 @xcite .",
    "the spin and cp properties as well as the couplings have been analyzed , and it has been shown that the nature of the discovered particle is consistent with the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson . therefore , the sm is established as a low energy effective theory that consistently explains phenomena below the tev scale .",
    "however , the sm have problems that should be resolved in a more fundamental theory . since the sm higgs boson is an elementary scalar , an unnatural cancellation between its bare mass squared and quadratically divergent contributions from radiative corrections is required . in order to keep the higgs boson mass to the weak scale .",
    "the reason for the fact that the electric charges of the sm particles are fractionally quantized is not explained .    it is intriguing that that the above - mentioned problems can be solved by introducing the concepts of supersymmetry ( susy ) and grand unification @xcite .",
    "in supersymmetric extensions of the sm , the loop contributions from sm particles are canceled with those from superpartners , and the problem of the quadratic divergence in the higgs boson mass squared is avoided . in grand",
    "unified theories ( guts ) , the sm gauge groups is embedded into a larger gauge group .",
    "simultaneously , the sm fermions are also embedded into larger representations . if the gut gauge group is ( semi-)simple , quantization of the electric charges of the sm particles is automatically realised .",
    "therefore , models of susy guts are excellent candidates for physics beyond the sm .",
    "however , there are have several unattractive points in susy guts .",
    "it should be noticed that the typical energy scale where the three sm gauge couplings are unified is around @xmath2 gev in ordinary susy guts . due to the decoupling theorem , the effects of the gut - scale particles are negligible at the tev scale @xcite .",
    "remnants of physics realized at the gut scale can be investigated only through relations among the masses and couplings of tev - scale particles .",
    "although the colored higgs triplets and the electroweak higgs doublets originate from the same multiplets , an unnaturally huge mass splitting between them are supposed for suppressing proton decay . to address this this doublet - triplet splitting problem",
    "many ideas have been proposed @xcite .    on the contrary , in the model where the doublet - triplet mass splitting is realized by supersymmetrizing the grand gauge - higgs unification ( ghu ) model , the existence of new light particles whose masses are of the order of the tev scale",
    "is predicted @xcite .",
    "the grand gauge - higgs unification is constructed on an extra dimension whose compactification scale is around the gut scale @xcite , and the gut gauge symmetry is broken due to the hosotani mechanism @xcite : the non - trivial vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the extra - dimensional component of one of the gauge fields accounts for the gut symmetry breaking .    in the supersymmetric grand gauge - higgs unification ( sgghu )",
    "model , there appear a color octet chiral superfield , an @xmath1 triplet chiral superfield with hypercharge zero and a neutral singlet chiral superfield at the tev scale as a by - product .",
    "as compared to the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the higgs sector is extended with the triplet and singlet chiral superfields .    in this presentation , we focus on the properties of the higgs sector of the sgghu model , and discuss its phenomenological signatures expected at collider experiments .",
    "the masses and couplings of the sgghu higgs sector particles are determined by solving renormalization group equations ( rges ) from the gut scale to the electroweak scale .",
    "we emphasize that models beyond the sm can be distinguished by precisely measuring the masses and couplings of the higgs bosons at the lhc and future electron - positron colliders such as the international linear collider ( ilc ) @xcite and the clic @xcite .",
    "the sgghu  model is a good example to show that collider experiments are capable of testing gut - scale physics .",
    "( red line ) and @xmath3 ( blue ) as well as the gauge couplings @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( green ) at the one loop level as a function of the energy scale @xmath7.,width=264 ]",
    "let us discuss the higgs sector of the low energy effective theory of the sgghu model .",
    "at the tev scale , the sgghu higgs sector consists of an @xmath1 triplet chiral superfield @xmath8 and an neutral singlet chiral superfield @xmath9 as well as the two mssm higgs doublets @xmath10 and @xmath11 . the superpotential is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 with @xmath14 @xmath15 being the pauli matrices . since the triplet @xmath8 and singlet @xmath9 originate from the gauge supermultiplet , the following remarkable features are predicted .",
    "trilinear self - couplings among @xmath9 and @xmath8 vanish although they are not prohibited in the general higgs superpotential with the triplet and singlet superfields .",
    "the higgs couplings @xmath16 and @xmath17 are unified with the sm gauge couplings at the gut scale .",
    "therefore , the properties of the higgs bosons are predicted with less ambiguity .",
    "the soft susy breaking operators in the higgs potential are given by @xmath18.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the soft parameters at the tev scale are computed by solving the rges .",
    "after radiative electroweak symmetry breaking , four cp - even , three cp - odd and three charged higgs bosons appear as physical particles .",
    "the vev of the neutral component of the triplet higgs boson @xmath19 , which is derived from the minimization conditions of the higgs potential , must be less than @xmath20 in order to be consistent with the rho parameter constraint . since @xmath21 is sufficiently small compared to @xmath22",
    ", it is negligible in the computations of the higgs boson masses and couplings .",
    "here , we discuss rg evolution of couplings and masses in the sgghu model .",
    "the introduction of the light adjoint multiplets disturbs the successful gauge coupling unification .",
    "one can easily recover the gauge coupling unification by adding extra incomplete @xmath0 matter multiplets .",
    "a judicious choice for the matter multiplets is a set of two vectorlike pairs of @xmath23 @xmath24 , one of @xmath25 @xmath26 and one of @xmath27 @xmath28 . here",
    ", the numbers in the parentheses denote @xmath29 , @xmath1 and @xmath30 quantum numbers , respectively @xcite .",
    "[ fig : couplings ] shows the rg evolution of the higgs triplet and singlet couplings @xmath16 ( red line ) and @xmath17 ( blue ) as well as the gauge couplings @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( green ) at the one loop level as a function of the energy scale @xmath7 .",
    "the couplings are normalized such that @xmath34 for the singlet higgs coupling and @xmath35 for the @xmath30 gauge coupling .",
    "the resulting higgs trilinear couplings at the tev - scale are given by @xmath36 the soft susy breaking parameters at the tev scale are also derived by solving the rges . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : couplings ] , the gauge couplings become strong around the gut scale . since the unified gaugino mass at the gut scale has to be large in order to avoid the gluino mass bound @xcite , typical values for the soft sfermion and higgs masses at the susy breaking scale are in the multi - tev range .",
    "therefore , some tuning is needed for successful radiative electroweak symmetry breaking . in spite of such difficulties",
    ", we can also obtain soft higgs mass parameters of the order of @xmath37 gev by tuning among the input parameters at the gut scale , as shown in the next section .",
    "the prediction about the sm - like higgs boson mass is affected by its interactions with the @xmath1 triplet and singlet higgs multiplets .",
    "when the soft scalar masses of the triplet and singlet higgs multiplets are relatively large , the approximate formula for the sm - like higgs boson mass is @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the @xmath40-boson mass , @xmath41 is the top quark mass , @xmath42 is the geometrical average of the stop mass eigenvalues , and @xmath43 . in the mssm",
    ", large stop masses are required even in the maximal stop mixing case in order to obtain an sm - like higgs boson mass of 125 gev @xcite . in our model , on the contrary , the sm - like higgs boson mass is lifted up by the higgs trilinear interactions with the triplet and singlet superfields for small @xmath44 .",
    "notice that the same mechanism is realized in the next - to - mssm ( nmssm ) @xcite . for our numerical computations of the masses of the higgs bosons and their superpartners ,",
    "we have appropriately modified the public numerical code ` suspect ` @xcite by adding the contributions from the triplet and singlet higgs superfields .",
    "since some fine tuning for the gut - scale input parameters is needed , we show our numerical results based on several benchmark points that can reproduce the observed sm - like higgs boson mass . because of theoretical uncertainties in the computation of the sm - like higgs boson mass , we take @xmath45 as its allowed mass range .",
    "we focus on the following three typical cases :    * mixings between the sm - like higgs boson and the other cp - even higgs bosons are small .",
    "* mixings between the sm - like higgs bosons and the cp - even components of the triplet and singlet higgs fields are small . *",
    "the cp - even components of the triplet and singlet higgs fields affect the sm - like higgs boson couplings .",
    "three successful benchmark points for the gut - scale input parameters and the tev - scale parameters obtained after solving the rges are listed in tab . [",
    "tab : benchmark - gut ] and [ tab : benchmark - tev ] , respectively .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as discussed above , comprehensive analysis of the masses and couplings of the higgs bosons at the lhc and future electron - positron colliders can distinguish models realized at the tev scale . even if the additional higgs bosons are beyond the reach of direct discovery , their effects are left in the sm - like higgs boson couplings and the mssm higgs masses and can be indirectly probed by their precision measurements .",
    "therefore , a new electron - positron collider is mandatory for exploring the higgs sector and the underlying theory .",
    "in the susy @xmath0 gut model where the hosotani mechanism accounts for the gut symmetry breaking , the low - energy higgs sector involves a higgs triplet and singlet chiral superfields as well as the two mssm higgs doublets . we have evaluated the sm - like higgs boson couplings to sm particles .",
    "it is shown that these couplings deviate from the corresponding sm predictions by @xmath46 when the triplet and singlet higgs bosons are lighter than @xmath47 .",
    "such deviations are measurable at future electron - positron colliders .",
    "when the masses of the mssm - like charged higgs boson and the mssm - like cp - odd higgs boson are less than @xmath48 , their mass difference is larger than the mssm prediction by @xmath46 - @xmath49 , and can be measured at the lhc . using these observations , our model can be distinguished from the mssm and nmssm .",
    "we emphasise that our supersymmetric grand gauge - higgs unification model is a good example to show that colliders are able to test physics realized at the gut scale .",
