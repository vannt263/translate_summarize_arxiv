    "unfortunately , there are two crucial problems which hinder the investigation through this approach .",
    "one is the limited spatial resolution of telescopes : these are in most cases insufficient to fully resolve the jet / wind launching region , which is believed to be located within a few au of the driving source .",
    "the other is the fact that such a region is often deeply embedded within a massive envelope , making it difficult to observe at optical to near - ir wavelengths .",
    "the rotation of jets / winds is arguably easier to observe than the kinematics in their launching regions .",
    "such observations are therefore useful for the understanding the mechanism of mass ejection and accretion .",
    "several observations have been attempted at optical - ir wavelengths , providing results consistent with the magneto - centrifugal wind scenario ( see , e.g. , davis et al .",
    "2000 ; bacciotti et al . 2002 ; coffey et al . 2004 ; woitas et al . 2004 ) .",
    "however , this approach may be hampered by spurious wavelength shifts of the grating spectrographs , or the interaction of the jet with the inhomogeneous ambient medium ( cf .",
    "bacciotti et al .",
    "millimeter / sub - millimeter interferometry in the near future has a great potential to overcome these difficulties for studying kinematics in the jet / wind launching region , and also measuring flow rotation .",
    "we have therefore begun to search for appropriate emission lines for these studies using the aste ( atacama submilimeter telescope experiment ) telescope , a single - dish 10-m submillimeter telescope in northern chile .",
