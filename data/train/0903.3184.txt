    "primordial black holes ( pbhs ) can form in the early universe via the collapse of large density perturbations  @xcite .",
    "if the density perturbation at horizon entry in a given region exceeds a threshold value , of order unity , then gravity overcomes pressure forces and the region collapses to form a pbh with mass of order the horizon mass .",
    "there are a number of limits , spanning a wide range of masses , on the pbh abundance .",
    "pbhs with mass @xmath1 will have evaporated by the present day  @xcite and their abundance is constrained by the consequences of the hawking radiation emitted .",
    "more massive pbhs are constrained by their present day gravitational effects .",
    "the resulting limits on the initial mass fraction of pbhs are very tight , @xmath2 , and can be used to constrain the power spectrum of the primordial density , or curvature , perturbations ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation , @xmath3 , on cosmological scales is now accurately measured by observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb )  @xcite and large scale structure  @xcite .",
    "these measurements can be used to constrain , and in some cases exclude , inflation models ( c.f . ref .",
    "cosmological observations span a relatively small range of scales ( comoving wavenumbers between @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) , and hence probe a limited region of the inflaton potential .",
    "the pbh constraints on the curvature power spectrum are fairly weak ; the upper limit is many orders of magnitude larger than the measurements on cosmological scales .",
    "they do , however , apply over a very wide range of scales ( from @xmath6 to @xmath7 ) and therefore provide a useful constraint on models of inflation  @xcite .",
    "the simplest assumption for the power spectrum is a scale - free power law with constant spectral index , @xmath8 : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a suitably chosen normalisation scale . in this case",
    "the pbh abundance constraints require @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "the spectral index on cosmological scales is , however , now accurately measured : @xmath12  @xcite . in other words , if the power spectrum is a pure power law then the number of pbhs formed will be completely negligible .",
    "however , as we will now outline , if the primordial perturbations are produced by inflation then the power spectrum is not expected to be an exact power law over all scales .",
    "the power spectrum produced by slow - roll inflation can be written as an expansion about a wave number @xmath10 ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath13 \\ln{\\left(\\frac{k}{k_{0}}\\right ) }    \\nonumber \\\\    & + &     \\frac{1}{2 } \\alpha(k_{0 } ) \\ln^2{\\left(\\frac{k}{k_{0}}\\right ) } + ... \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the spectral index and its running , @xmath14 , are evaluated at @xmath10 and can be expressed in terms of the slow - roll parameters .",
    "this expansion is valid provided @xmath15 is small for the relevant @xmath16 values .",
    "this is the case for cosmological observations , but not for the wide range of scales probed by pbh constraints .",
    "in fact only very specific , and contrived , inflaton potentials produce a constant spectral index  @xcite .",
    "it is possible for the power spectrum to vary sufficiently with scale so that pbhs can potentially be over - produced .",
    "for instance in the running - mass inflation model  @xcite , the power spectrum is strongly scale - dependent and pbh constraints exclude otherwise viable regions of parameter space  @xcite",
    ". more generally , peiris and easther  @xcite recently found , using slow roll reconstruction , that inflation models which are consistent with cosmological data can over - produce pbhs .",
    "motivated by this , we compile and update the constraints on the abundance of pbhs ( sec .  [ abund ] ) .",
    "we then translate the abundance constraints into detailed generalised constraints on the power spectrum of the curvature perturbations ( sec .",
    "[ const ] ) , taking into account the evolution of the density perturbations prior to horizon entry .",
    "the pbh constraints can , broadly , be split into two classes : those that arise from their present day gravitational consequences and those that arise from the products of their evaporation . in both cases , in order to constrain the primordial density or curvature perturbation , we need to translate the constraints into limits on the initial pbh mass fraction .    throughout",
    "we will assume that the pbhs form at a single epoch and their mass is a fixed fraction , @xmath17 , of the horizon mass @xmath18 , where @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "a scale invariant power spectrum produces an extended pbh mass function @xmath20  @xcite , however ( as discussed in the introduction above ) in this case the number density of pbhs would be completely negligible  @xcite . for scale - dependent power spectra which produce an interesting pbh abundance",
    "it can be assumed that all pbhs form at a single epoch  @xcite . as a consequence of near critical phenomena in gravitational collapse  @xcite the pbh mass may , however , depend on the size of the fluctuation from which it forms  @xcite in which case the mass function has finite width . most of the constraints that we discuss below effectively apply to the mass function integrated over a range of masses .",
    "the range of applicability is usually significantly larger than the width of the mass function produced by critical collapse , so in the absence of a concrete prediction or model for the primordial power spectrum in most cases it is reasonable to approximate the mass function as a delta - function .",
    "the constraints from cosmic - rays and gamma - rays produced by recently evaporating pbhs are an exception to this .",
    "these constraints depend significantly on the pbh mass function and therefore need to be calculated on a case by case basis  @xcite .",
    "we therefore do not include these constraints in our calculation of generalised constraints on the curvature perturbation power spectrum .",
    "taking into account the cosmological expansion , the initial pbh mass fraction , @xmath21 , is related to the present day pbh density , @xmath22 , by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the scale factor , ` eq ' refers to matter - radiation equality and @xmath25 is the critical energy density . using the constancy of the entropy , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 refers to the number of entropy degrees of freedom , we relate the scale factor to the temperature of the universe and using the radiation density , @xmath28 , and horizon mass , @xmath29 , we obtain @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the total number of effectively massless degrees of freedom and",
    "we have taken @xmath32 .",
    "the horizon mass at matter - radiation equality is given by ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath33 inserting numerical values , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40  @xcite gives @xmath41 so that @xmath42    as first shown by hawking  @xcite a black hole with mass @xmath43 emits thermal radiation with temperature @xmath44 the current understanding of pbh evaporation  @xcite is that pbhs directly emit all particles which appear elementary at the energy scale of the pbh and have rest mass less than the black hole temperature .",
    "thus if the black hole temperature exceeds the qcd confinement scale , quark and gluon jets are emitted directly .",
    "the quark and gluon jets then fragment and decay producing astrophysically stable particles : photons , neutrinos , electrons , protons and their anti - particles . taking into account the number of emitted species the mass loss rate can be written as  @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 takes into account the number of directly emitted species ( @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the number of degrees of freedom with spin @xmath49 ) and is normalized to one for pbhs with mass @xmath50 which can only emit photons and neutrinos . for lighter pbhs @xmath51 .",
    "the pbh lifetime is then given by  @xcite @xmath52    from the wmap 5 year data  @xcite the present age of the universe is @xmath53 gyr .",
    "the initial mass of a pbhs which is evaporating today is therefore @xmath54 g  @xcite , while less massive pbhs will have evaporated by the present day .",
    "we will now compile , and where relevant update , the pbh abundance constraints .",
    "we divide the constraints into two classes : those , for pbhs with @xmath55 g , arising from their gravitational consequences ( sec .",
    "[ gravconst ] ) and those for @xmath56 g arising from their evaporation ( sec .",
    "[ evapconst ] ) .",

    "they require some modeling of the milky way halo ( typically the density and/or velocity distribution of the halo objects ) .",
    "consequently there is a factor of a few uncertainty in the precise values of the constraints .    assuming that pbhs make up the same fraction of the halo dark matter as they do of the cosmological cold dark matter , and ignoring the uncertainties in the cdm density ( since this is negligible compared with the uncertainties in halo fraction limit calculations )",
    ", we can relate the halo fraction to the pbh cosmological density : @xmath72      solar and planetary mass compact objects in the milky way halo can microlens stars in the magellanic clouds , causing temporary one - off brightening of the microlensed star  @xcite .",
    "the relationship between the observed optical depth , @xmath73 , ( the probability that a given star is amplified by more than a factor of 1.34 ) and the fraction of the halo in machos depends on the distribution of machos in the mw halo . for the ` standard ' halo model used by the microlensing community ( a spherical cored isothermal sphere ) @xmath74  @xcite , with the derived value of limits on @xmath75 varying by factors of order unity for other halo models .",

    "pbhs with masses in the range @xmath90 evaporate between @xmath91 and the present day and can contribute to the diffuse gamma - ray background  @xcite .",
    "as discussed above , these constraints depend significantly on the pbh mass function and hence we will not consider them further .",
