    "there is no question that instantons @xcite , euclidean classical solutions of the field equations , represent one of the most beautiful phenomena in theoretical physics @xcite-@xcite .",
    "instantons in non - abelian gauge theories of the qcd type are important component of the non - perturbative vacuum structure , in particular they break chiral symmetries and thus significantly contribute to the nucleon ( and our ) mass @xcite .",
    "instantons in supersymmetric gauge theories lead to derivation of the exact beta function @xcite , and in the  seiberg - witten \" @xmath0=2 case to derivation of the super potential by the exact evaluation of the instanton contributions to all orders @xcite .",
    "the instanton method now has applications in stochastic settings beyond quantum mechanics or field theories , and even physics  in chemistry and biology  see e.g. discussion of its usage in the problem of protein folding in @xcite .",
    "since the work by a.  polyakov @xcite the problem of a double well potential ( dwp ) has been considered as the simplest quantum mechanical setting illustrating the role of instantons in more complicated quantum field theories . in the case of the dwp one can perform certain technical tasks  like we do below  which so far are out of reach in more complicated / realistic settings .",
    "tunneling in quantum mechanical context has been studied extensively using wkb and other semiclassical means .",
    "the aim of this paper is not to increase accuracy on these quantum - mechanical results , but rather to develop tools - feynman diagrams on top of an instanton - which can be used in the context of many dimensions and especially in quantum field theories ( qfts ) .",
    "therefore we do @xmath1 use anything stemming from the schrdinger equation in this work , in particularly do not use series resulting from recurrence relations or resurgence relations ( in general , conjectured ) by several authors .",
    "another reason to study dwp is existing deep connections between the quantum mechanical instantons  via schrdinger equation  with wider mathematical issues , of approximate solutions to differential equations , defined in terms of certain generalized series .",
    "a particular form of an exact quantization condition was _ conjectured _ by j.  zinn - justin and collaborators ( for a review see @xcite and references therein ) , which links series around the instantons with the usual perturbative series in the perturbative vacuum .",
    "unfortunately , no rigorous proof of such a connection exist , and it remains unknown if it can or can not be generalized to the field theory cases we are mainly interested in .",
    "recently , for the quartic double well and sine - gordon potentials dunne and nsal ( see @xcite and also references therein ) have presented more arguments for this connection , which they call _ resurgent relation_.    in @xcite the method and key elements ( a non - trivial instanton background and new effective vertices ) to calculate the two - loop correction to the tunneling amplitude for the dwp were established . in particular , the anharmonic oscillator was considered in order to show how to apply feynman diagrams technique . in @xcite",
    "the green function in the instanton background was corrected , and it was attempted to obtain two- and three - loop corrections .",
    "finally , whler and shuryak @xcite corrected some errors made in @xcite and reported the exact result for the two - loop correction .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to evaluate the three - loop correction to the tunneling amplitude and compare it with the results obtained in @xcite by a completely different method , not available in the field theory settings .",
    "let us consider the quantum - mechanical problem of a particle of mass @xmath2 in a double well potential @xmath3 the well - known instanton solution @xmath4 , with @xmath5 , describing the barrier tunneling is the path which possesses the minimal action @xmath6=\\frac{\\omega^3}{12\\,\\lambda}$ ] .",
    "setting @xmath7 , and shifting coordinate to the minimum of the potential one gets the anharmonic oscillator potential in a form @xmath8 with one ( small ) dimensionless parameter @xmath9 .",
    "j.  zinn - justin et al @xcite use the same potential with @xmath10 .",
    "the classical action @xmath11 of the instanton solution is therefore large and @xmath12 is used in the expansion.the ground state energy @xmath13 within the zero - instanton sector ( pure perturbation theory ) is written in the form @xmath14 another series to be discussed is the splitting @xmath15 related to the so called instanton density in the one - instanton approximation as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the well - known one - loop semiclassical result @xcite .",
    "coefficients @xmath18 in the series ( [ e0 ] ) can be calculated using the ordinary perturbation theory ( see @xcite ) while many coefficients @xmath19 in the expansion ( [ dele0 ] ) were found by j.  zinn - justin , 1981 - 2005 ( see @xcite and references therein ) , obtained via the so called _ exact bohr - sommerfeld quantization condition_. alternatively , using the feynman diagrams technique whler and shuryak @xcite calculated the two - loop correction @xmath20 in agreement with the result by j.  zinn - justin @xcite .",
    "higher order coefficients @xmath19 in ( [ dele0 ] ) can also be computed in this way .",
    "since we calculate the energy difference , all feynman diagrams in the instanton background ( with the instanton - based vertices and the green s function ) need to be accompanied by subtraction of the same diagrams for the anharmonic oscillator , without the instanton ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "for @xmath21 it permits to evaluate the ratio @xmath22 where the matrix elements @xmath23 are calculated using the instanton - based and vacuum diagrams , respectively .    the instanton - based green s function @xmath24 @xmath25 + \\frac{3}{8}(1-x^2)(1-y^2)\\bigg[{\\log}g^0(x , y ) -\\frac{11}{3 }   \\bigg ] \\ , \\label{gf}\\ ] ] is expressed in variables @xmath26 , in which the familiar oscillator green function @xmath27 of the harmonic oscillator is @xmath28 in its derivation there were two steps .",
    "one was to find a function which satisfies the green function equation , used via two independent solutions and standard wronskian method .",
    "the second step is related to a zero mode : one can add a term @xmath29 with any coefficient and still satisfy the equation .",
    "the coefficient is then fixed from orthogonality to the zero mode , see @xcite .",
    "the two - loop coefficient is given by the two - loop diagrams ( see fig .",
    "[ f1 ] and @xcite ) , @xmath30 where @xmath31 reflecting the contribution of four feynman diagrams .",
    "the three - loop correction @xmath32 ( [ dele0 ] ) we are interested in is given by the sum of eighteen 3-loop feynman diagrams , which we group as follows ( see figs .",
    "[ f2 ] - [ f3 ] ) @xmath33 complementing by a contribution from two - loop feynman diagrams @xmath34 ( see ( [ b1 ] ) ) .",
    "thus , all feynman diagrams contributing to ( [ b2 ] ) are presented in figs .",
    "[ f1]-[f3 ] .",
    "the rules of constructing the integrals for each diagram should be clear from next two examples .",
    "the explicit expression for the feynman integral @xmath35 in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] is @xmath36 @xmath37 while for @xmath38 in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] it takes the form @xmath39 here we introduced notations @xmath40 and @xmath41 . notice",
    "that the @xmath42 's diagrams come from the jacobian of the zero mode and have no analogs in the anharmonic oscillator ( single well potential ) problem .",
    "for calculation of the symmetry factors for a given feynman s diagram we use the wick s theorem and contractions , see e.g @xcite .",
    "it can be illustrated by the next two examples .",
    "for diagram @xmath43 the four propagators can be rearranged in @xmath44 ways and the effect is duplicated by interchanging the two vertices @xmath45 giving a symmetry factor of @xmath46 . for the diagram @xmath47 the last propagator , which starts and ends at the same vertex forming loop , contributes with a factor of two which is also duplicated by rearranging the two inner propagators , finally , the symmetry factor of @xmath48 .",
    "the obtained results are summarized in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "all diagrams are of the form of two - dimensional , three - dimensional and four - dimensional integrals . in particular , the diagrams @xmath43 and @xmath49 ( see fig . [ f2 ] ) @xmath50 is given by two - dimensional integrals are the only ones which we are able to calculate analytically @xmath51    here @xmath52 denotes the riemann zeta function of argument @xmath53 ( see e. whittaker and g. watson ( 1927 ) ) .",
    "they contain a rational and an irrational contribution such that @xmath54    it shows that the irrational contribution to @xmath43 is dominant with respect to the rational part while for diagram @xmath49 the situation is opposite .",
    "other diagrams , see table i , were evaluated numerically with an absolute accuracy @xmath55 .",
    "surprisingly , almost all of them ( 15 out of 18 diagrams ) are of the same order @xmath56 as @xmath32 with few of them ( diagrams @xmath57 ) which are of order @xmath58 .",
    "j.  zinn - justin ( see @xcite and references therein ) reports a value of @xmath59 while present calculation shows that @xmath60 which is in agreement , up to the precision employed in the numerical integration .",
    "similarly to the two - loop correction @xmath61 the coefficient @xmath32 is negative .",
    "note also that for @xmath61 all diagrams are negative while for @xmath32 there are diagrams of both signs . for not - so - large barriers ( @xmath62 ) ,",
    "the two - loop and three - loop corrections are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the dominant contribution comes from the sum of the four - vertex diagrams @xmath63 while the three - vertex diagrams @xmath64 provides minor contribution , their sum represents less than @xmath65 of the total correction @xmath32 .",
    "interesting that for both two and three loop cases the largest contribution comes from diagrams stemming from the jacobian , @xmath42 for @xmath61 and @xmath66 for @xmath32 .",
    "those diagrams are absent in the perturbative vacuum series , and thus do not have subtractions .",
    "we already noted that some individual three - loop diagrams contain irrational numbers . since the j.  zinn - justin s result is a rational number , then there must be a cancelation of these irrational contributions in the sum ( [ b2 ] ) . from ( [ b11 ] )",
    "we note that the term @xmath67 gives a contribution of order @xmath58 to the mentioned sum ( [ b2 ] ) , and therefore the coincidence @xmath68 between present result ( [ b2o ] ) and one of j.  zinn - justin ( [ b2z ] ) is an indication that such a cancelation occurs .",
    "now , we evaluate the coefficients @xmath69 , @xmath70 in ( [ e0 ] ) using feynman diagrams ( see @xcite ) . in order to do it",
    "let us consider the anharmonic oscillator potential @xmath8 and calculate the transition amplitude @xmath71 .",
    "all involved feynman integrals can be evaluated analytically . in the limit @xmath72",
    "the coefficients of order @xmath73 and @xmath74 in front of @xmath75 gives us the value of @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "as it was mentioned above the @xmath42 's diagrams do not exist for the anharmonic oscillator problem .",
    "the feynman integrals in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] give us the value of @xmath69 , explicitly they are equal to @xmath76 the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] determine @xmath70 and corresponding values are presented in table [ tab1 ] , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "straightforward evaluation gives @xmath79 which is in agreement with the results obtained in standard multiplicative perturbation theory ( see @xcite ) .",
    "no irrational numbers appear in the evaluation of @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "it is worth noting that ( see table [ tab1 ] ) some feynman integrals being different give the same contribution , @xmath80 in the instanton background the corresponding values of these diagrams do not coincide but are very close .",
    ".contribution of each diagram in fig.[f2 ] - [ f3 ] for the three - loop corrections @xmath32 ( left ) and @xmath70 ( right ) with symmetry factor included .",
    "we write @xmath81 where @xmath82 denote the sum of two - dimensional , three - dimensional and four - dimensional integrals , respectively .",
    "similarly , @xmath83 .",
    "the term @xmath84 ( see text ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in conclusion , we have calculated the tunneling amplitude ( level splitting or the instanton density ) up to three - loops using feynman diagrams for quantum perturbations on top of the instanton .",
    "our result for @xmath32 is found to be in good agreement with the resurgent relation between perturbative and instanton series suggested by j.  zinn - justin ( for modern reference see @xcite ) .",
    "let us remind again , that this paper is methodical in nature , and its task was to develop tools to calculate tunneling phenomena in multidimensional qm or qft context , in which any results stemming from the schrdinger equation are not available .",
    "we use a quantum mechanical example as a test of the tools we use : but the tools themselves are expected to work in much wider context .",
    "one comment on the results is that the final three - loop answer has a rational value .",
    "however , unlike the evaluation of the two - loop coefficient @xmath61 where all feynman diagrams turned out to be rational numbers , in our case of @xmath32 at least two diagrams contain irrational parts .",
    "what is the origin of these terms and how they cancel out among themselves are questions left unanswered above , since several diagrams had resisted our efforts to get the analytic answer , so that we used numerical multidimensional integration methods , in particular , a dynamical partitioning @xcite .",
    "perhaps , this can still be improved .",
    "another intriguing issue is the conjectured relation between the instanton and vacuum series : at the moment we do not understand its origin from the path integral settings .",
    "some diagrams are similar , but expressions quite different and unrelated .",
    "new ( tadpole ) diagrams originate from the instanton zero mode jacobian , and those have no analogues in the vacuum .",
    "surprisingly , they provide the dominant contribution to two- , three - loop corrections @xmath61 ( one diagram out of four , see fig.1 ) and @xmath32 ( six diagrams out of 18 , see fig.3 ) ) : @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively , see table i. it implies that the sum of vacuum - like diagrams originating from the action is small .    finally , we note that to our knowledge this is the first three - loop calculation on a nontrivial background of an instanton .",
    "similar calculations for gauge theories would be certainly possible and are of obvious interest .",
    "one technical issue to be solved is gauge green function orthogonal to all ( including gauge change ) zero modes .",

    "_ note added in proof ( july , 2015 ) _ :    during the time after the paper was submitted for publication we obtained a number of new results .",
    "we evaluated the contributions of @xmath87-like diagrams , with maximal number of integrations , to the next order coefficients .",
    "the trend continues : those diagrams still contribute a significant fraction of the total answer , namely @xmath88 of total two- , three- , four- , five - loop @xmath89 contributions , respectively . at the same time , surprisingly , the absolute values of all these diagrams are rather close .",
    "advance in numerical multidimensional integrations lead to an increase in accuracy , the agreement in @xmath32 is now improved to six significant digits .",
