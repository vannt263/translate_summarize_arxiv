    "gene expression is the central activity in a living cell .",
    "genes are fragments of dna molecules and provide the blueprint for the synthesis of functional molecules such as rnas and proteins . in each cell , at any instant of time , only a subset of genes present is active in directing rna / protein synthesis .",
    "the gene expression is `` on '' in such a case .",
    "there are two major steps in gene expression : transcription and translation . during transcription the sequence along one of the strands of the dna molecule",
    "is copied or transcribed in a rna molecule ( mrna ) . during translation",
    ", the sequence of the mrna molecule is translated into the sequence of amino acids constituting a protein , i.e. , a protein molecule is synthesized .",
    "regulation of gene expression is an essential process in the living cell and determines the rates and patterns of gene expression .",
    "an in - depth understanding of gene expression and its regulation is the central focus of biology @xcite .",
    "the processes of transcription and translation involve several biochemical reactions , the kinetics of which determine how the number of participating biomolecules changes as a function of time . in the traditional differential rate - equation approach , the time evolution of a system of chemical reactions is assumed to be continuous and deterministic . in reality , the time evolution is not a continuous process as molecular population levels in a reacting system change only by discrete integer amounts .",
    "furthermore , the time evolution is not deterministic as the collision of molecules which brings about a chemical reaction is a probabilistic event .",
    "the deterministic rate equation approach is justified when the number of molecules of each chemical species is large compared to thermal fluctuations in the concentration . in a living cell , the number of molecules participating in different biochemical reactions is often small and there are considerable fluctuations in the reaction rates . as a result , the time evolution of the reacting system , in terms of how the number of reacting molecules changes as a function of time is stochastic rather than deterministic .",
    "there is now an increasing realization that stochasticity plays an important role in determining the outcome of biochemical processes in the cell @xcite .",
    "stochastic effects in gene expression explain the pronounced cell - cell variation observed in isogenic populations .",
    "a cell may have the option of proceeding along one of two possible developmental pathways .",
    "the pathway selection is probabilistic and the cell fate depends on the particular choice of pathway .",
    "thus , even a clonal population of cells can give rise to two distinct subpopulations in the course of time .",
    "the randomization of pathway choice leads to diversity and increases the likelihood of survival of organisms in widely different environments .",
    "the issue of stochasticity ( randomness or noise ) and its effect on cellular processes as well as on the operation of synthetic devices like genetic switches , has been addressed in several theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "a complete understanding of cellular processes requires an appreciation of events at the level of an individual cell and subsequent extrapolation to an ensemble of cells .",
    "recent experimental advances have made it possible to study processes within a single cell unmasked by ensemble averaging @xcite .",
    "the simplest event one can study at the single cell level is that of the expression of a reporter gene such as _ lacz _ and _ gfp_. in the former case , the end product is an enzyme @xmath7-galactosidase which is capable of hydrolyzing a noncolored substrate to a colored product . in the latter case ,",
    "the protein itself is fluorescent .",
    "hence , the gene expression can be directly studied either colorimetrically or fluorometrically at the level of an individual cell .",
    "recent experiments using such techniques , provide evidence that gene expression occurs in abrupt stochastic bursts at the level of an individual cell @xcite .",
    "two very recent experiments @xcite provide direct evidence of stochasticity in gene expression . in both the experiments ,",
    "a quantitative measure of the noise associated with gene expression has been obtained .",
    "the noise has both intrinsic and extrinsic components .",
    "intrinsic noise is the difference in protein synthesis which arises when two identical copies of a gene are expressed under the same conditions .",
    "extrinsic noise occurs due to fluctuations in the cellular components required for gene expression .",
    "the experiments provide a quantitative framework for the characterization of noise in gene regulatory networks .",
    "some earlier experiments on both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have provided evidence of the so - called `` all or none '' phenomenon in gene expression @xcite .",
    "this implies that in an individual cell , gene expression is either low / off or has a high value . in an ensemble of cells",
    "the protein levels are distributed in a bimodal manner , a large fraction of cells synthesize proteins at a low ( may be zero ) level or produce them at a high level .",
    "most of the experiments require the presence of inducers / enhancers to observe bimodality .",
    "there is strong experimental evidence that inducer / enhancers increase the number of expressing cells but not the level of expression per cell @xcite .",
    "the process of gene expression is analogous to a binary switch which can be in `` on '' and `` off '' positions .",
    "inducer / enhancer molecules make it favorable for the switch to be in the `` on '' position .",
    "some theories have been proposed so far to explain the so - called `` all or none '' phenomenon in prokaryotic gene expression .",
    "the theories are mostly based on an autocatalytic feedback mechanism @xcite , synthesis of the gene product gives rise to the transport or production of inducer molecules which in turn promote further gene expression . in section",
    "ii of this paper , we propose a model of gene expression and show that in the presence of a sufficient number of inducer molecules in a cell , gene expression in that cell occurs at a high level . in cells where inducer molecules are absent or are few in number , gene expression occurs at practically zero level . the role of autocatalysis in the `` all or none '' phenomenon",
    "is also commented upon .",
    "the method employed for the study is that of stochastic simulation based on the gillespie algorithm ( ga ) @xcite .",
    "the ga provides a stochastic realization of the temporal pattern of gene expression and is more realistic and accurate than the deterministic differential rate equation approach .",
    "our model of gene expression includes the major biochemical reactions involved in transcription and translation . in section iii",
    ", we explore the parameter space of the model and obtain different temporal patterns of gene expression .",
    "one parameter region of particular interest corresponds to stochastic flips between the states 1 and 2 at random time intervals . in state 1 ,",
    "the protein level is zero .",
    "this is an example of a binary switch which makes stochastic transitions between the states 1 and 2 and the temporal process is analogous to a two - state jump phenomenon .",
    "the effect of changing the reaction parameters on the temporal patterns of gene expression is further studied .",
    "some of the results can be understood in the framework of a simple mathematical model .",
    "we consider a single gene . the gene is transcribed into mrna by an enzyme called @xmath8 polymerase ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the process is initiated with the binding of rnap to a site called promoter , usually near the beginning of the transcribed sequence .",
    "expression of most genes are regulated at the level of transcription and more specifically during the initiation of transcription , that is , before the first phosphodiester bond is formed .",
    "regulation of transcription initiation is achieved by the binding of a regulatory protein ( @xmath10 ) to an overlapping segment of dna ( called operator @xmath11 ) resulting in a turning off of mrna production .",
    "rnap and the regulatory r molecules are mutually exclusive .",
    "if rnap binds to the promoter region first , it prevents the binding of r to the operator region and vice versa . an inducer molecule ( @xmath12 )",
    "may bind to r both when r is free and when r is bound to the operator o. in the later case , the complex of i and r detaches from the operator . as long as r is forming a bound complex with i , it is unable to bind at o and so can not function as a regulatory protein .",
    "r regains its activity when the inducer dissociates from the i_r complex and r is able to occupy the operator region once more .",
    "the biochemical reactions considered in the model of gene expression are : + reaction 1 : @xmath13 regulatory molecule r binds to the operator region o to form the bound complex @xmath14 .",
    "+ reaction 2:@xmath15 bound complex o_r dissociates into free r and o. + reaction 3:@xmath16 rna polymerase ( rnap ) binds to the promoter region p forming the closed complex p_rnap@xmath17 .",
    "+ reaction 4:@xmath18 the closed complex dissociates into free rnap and p. + reaction 5 : @xmath19 isomerization of closed to open complex p_rnap@xmath20 occurs .",
    "the open complex is the activated form of the rnap - promoter complex .",
    "+ reaction 6:@xmath21 rnap clears the promoter region and synthesis of the mrna chain starts .",
    "the appearance of the ribosome binding site rbs occurs at the beginning of the mrna chain .",
    "trrnap denotes transcribing rna polymerase .",
    "+ reaction 7 : @xmath22 rnap completes transcription and is released from dna .",
    "+ reaction 8:@xmath23 ribosome binds to rbs and ribrbs denotes the bound complex .",
    "+ reaction 9:@xmath24 ribosome dissociates from the bound complex ribrbs .",
    "+ reaction 10:@xmath25 rbs degrades due to the binding of rnasee at rbs .",
    "this binding event is not considered separately . + reaction 11:@xmath26 rbs is cleared and the ribosome eirib initiates translation of mrna chain .",
    "+ reaction 12:@xmath27 protein synthesis by transcribing ribosome is completed .",
    "+ reaction 13:@xmath28 degradation of protein product occurs .",
    "+ reaction 14:@xmath29 inducer molecule binds to free regulatory molecule r. i_r is the bound complex of i and r. + reaction 15:@xmath30 bound complex dissociates into free i and r. + reaction 16:@xmath31 inducer binds to bound complex @xmath14 , the complex @xmath32 detaches and the operator region o is freed .",
    "we emphasize that for many of the steps described above , alternate mechanisms exist .",
    "however , the mechanism described here is consistent with many gene regulatory systems .",
    "reaction schemes ( 1 ) - ( 13 ) are based on those considered in refs.@xcite .",
    "transcription and translation are tightly coupled in prokaryotes .",
    "as soon as rnap leaves the promoter region , the 5@xmath33 end of the mrna chain , containing the rbs , is available for ribosome binding ( reaction 6 ) .",
    "this implies that the mrna chain need not be completely synthesized to allow for ribosome binding ( reaction 8) , protein synthesis by translating ribosome ( reaction 12 ) and mrna degradation at rbs ( reaction 10 ) .",
    "following ref.@xcite , the number of mrna molecules at any instant of time is given by the sum of the numbers of rbs and ribrbs , the bound complex of ribosome and rbs .",
    "the functional degradation of mrna starts at the moment rnasee binds to the rbs .",
    "we now give a brief description of the gillespie algorithm ( ga ) @xcite .",
    "suppose there are n chemical species participating in m chemical reactions .",
    "let x(i ) , i = 1 , 2 , 3 . . .",
    ", n denote the number of molecules of the i th chemical species .",
    "given the values of x(i ) , i = 1 , 2 , 3 , . .",
    ", n at a time @xmath34 , the ga is designed to answer two questions : ( 1 ) when will the next reaction occur ? and",
    "( 2 ) what type of reaction will it be ? let the next reaction occur at time @xmath34@xmath35@xmath36 .",
    "knowing the type of reaction , one can adjust the numbers of participating molecules in accordance with the reaction schemes .",
    "thus , with repeated applications of the ga , one can keep track of how the numbers x(i ) s change as a function of time due to the occurrence of m different types of chemical reactions . each reaction @xmath37 ( @xmath37 = 1 , 2 , . .",
    ", m ) has a stochastic rate constant @xmath38@xmath39 associated with it .",
    "this rate constant has the following interpretation :    @xmath38@xmath39@xmath40 = probability that a particular combination of reactant molecules participates in the @xmath37 th reaction in the infinitesimal time interval ( @xmath34 , @xmath41 ) .",
    "let @xmath42@xmath39 be the number of distinct molecular combinations for the @xmath37 th reaction .",
    "then    @xmath43@xmath39@xmath40@xmath44@xmath42@xmath39@xmath38@xmath39@xmath40 = probability that the @xmath37 th reaction occurs in the infinitesimal time interval ( @xmath34 , @xmath41 ) .",

    "it is straightforward to show that@xmath46 where @xmath47    what is needed now is to generate a random pair ( @xmath36,@xmath37 ) according to the probability distribution ( 17 ) .",
    "let r@xmath48 and r@xmath49 be two random numbers obtained by invoking the standard unit interval uniform random number generator .",
    "one can then show that @xmath36 and @xmath37 are obtained as @xmath50 and @xmath37 is taken to be the integer for which @xmath51    a rigorous proof of the formulae ( 19 ) - ( 20 ) is given in ref.@xcite .",
    "once @xmath36 and @xmath37 are known , the time evolution of the reacting system is specified .",
    "the stochastic rate constant @xmath38@xmath39 is related to the more familiar deterministic reaction rate constant @xmath52@xmath39 through simple relations . in the case of first order reactions , both constants have the same value . in the case of second order reactions ,",
    "the rate constant is divided by the volume of the system .",
    "we have applied the ga to our model of gene expression involving n = 15 types of biomolecules participating in m = 16 biochemical reactions . in the initial state ( time @xmath34=0 ) , the number of free operator and promoter sites is 1 .",
    "the number of r , i , rnap , and ribosome molecules is @xmath53 20 , @xmath54 20 , @xmath55 400 and @xmath56 350 respectively .",
    "the number of all the other biomolecules is set to zero at @xmath34 = 0 .",
    "the simulation time is up to 2000s , i.e. , less than the cell generation time typically in the range 2000 - 3000s .",
    "as already mentioned , knowledge of @xmath36 and @xmath37 enables one to calculate the numbers of biomolecules at time @xmath34+@xmath36 and in this way , through repeated applications of the ga , one can keep track of how the different numbers change as a function of time .",
    "fig.1 shows the number of protein molecules present in the system as a function of time .",

    "the protein number in this case is very small , practically zero .",
    "the other curves corresponds to values of @xmath0 closer to @xmath3 as @xmath0 approaches @xmath5 , protein levels are intermediate between high and low .",

    "2 . no . of protein molecules as a function of time .",
    "the stochastic rate constants are the same as in fig . 1 except that @xmath90 and @xmath91    the `` all or none '' phenomenon has been observed in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells . in prokaryotes , genes are often arranged in operons , i.e , sets of contiguous genes which include structural and regulatory sequences .",
    "a well - known example is that of the _ e. coli _ lactose ( _ lac _ ) operon @xcite .",
    "lac operon consists of three structural genes ( z , y and @xmath43 ) which code for the three proteins : @xmath7-galactosidase , the enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of lactose to glucose and galactose ; permease , a carrier protein responsible for membrane transport of lactose into the cell and a third protein transacetylase .",
    "the lac operon contains three regulatory sequences , i , p and o , which control the transcription of mrna leading to the synthesis of the three proteins .",
    "the sequence i corresponds to a gene laci which is transcribed continuously to synthesize a repressor protein , lac repressor , at a low level .",
    "lac repressor binds to the operator sequence o and prevents the transcription of the genes z , y and @xmath43 so that the @xmath7-galactosidase enzyme and the permease molecules are not produced .",
    "if the bacterium is to grow on lactose ( milk sugar ) which acts as its carbon source , @xmath7-galactosidase must be made available to split the sugar into glucose and galactose .",
    "the breakdown product of lactose act as an inducer molecule .",
    "the inducer attaches to the repressor molecule , causing it to release the dna so that transcription of the structural gene is possible .",
    "the repressor is freed of the inducer when the lactose supply is exhausted and switches off the expression of the structural genes once more .",
    "our simple model of gene expression incorporates some of the key features of the lac operon .",
    "the role of the lac repressor is played by the regulatory molecule r though its synthesis is not explicitly considered .",
    "there is a single gene in our model analogous to the structural gene z expressing the enzyme @xmath7-galactosidase . the inducer molecule i acts in the same manner as in the case of the lac operon .",
    "the experimental observation of the `` all - or - none '' phenomenon in the lac operon has been attributed to autocatalytic feedback mechanisms @xcite . at low inducer concentrations ,",
    "some of the bacterial cells synthesize protein at the full rate whereas the other cells are in the `` off '' state .",
    "when inducer is added to the colony of bacterial cells , simultaneous production of the @xmath7-galactosidase enzyme and permease molecules occurs .",
    "the permease molecules transport lactose into the cell raising the internal inducer concentration which in turn promotes the production of more @xmath7-galactosidase and permease .",
    "thus an autocatalytic feedback process is at work and within a short time after the appearance of the first permease molecules , the bacterial cell becomes fully induced synthesizing the structural proteins at maximum rate .",
    "siegele and hu @xcite carried out experiments on gene expression from plasmids containing the arabad promoter in the presence of subsaturating concentrations of the inducer arabinose . again , as in the case of the lac operon , it has been suggested that an autocatalytic induction mechanism , due to the accumulation of inducer molecules by transport , is at work .",
    "however in all the experiments , full induction of cells has been observed even in the absence of autocatalysis , i.e. , when the inducer availability is not linked to that of synthesized protein molecules like permease . our model of gene expression does not include an autocatalytic feedback process and",
    "a detailed analysis of the simulation results shows that if the number of inducer @xmath92@xmath93 molecules , @xmath0 , is greater than or equal to the number of regulatory @xmath94 molecules , @xmath5 , in a cell , the cell reaches a steady state which is state 2 ( high protein level ) . if @xmath0= @xmath95 or @xmath4 @xmath5 , the cell is in state 1 ( low / zero level ) but as @xmath0 approaches @xmath5 , protein levels intermediate between high and low are obtained .",
    "the `` all or none '' phenomenon becomes more pronounced in the presence of the autocatalytic induction ( ai ) mechanism .",
    "if @xmath0 is originally small in a cell , the ai mechanism leads to a rapid increase in @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath0 is @xmath2 @xmath5 , the cell is in state 2 in the steady state .",
    "the magnitude of the protein level in state 2 is independent of the value of @xmath0 in agreement with experimental results .",
    "autocatalysis is responsible for a sharp bimodal distribution in protein levels . in the absence of autocatalysis",
    ", the magnitude of the protein level in state 2 is the same as in the case of autocatalysis but the bimodal distribution become less sharp due to intermediate protein levels in a fraction of cells .",
    "our simulation results are in agreement with experimental observations @xcite .",
    "experiments @xcite on single mammalian cells ( eukaryotic cells ) have provided further evidence of bimodality in the distribution of protein levels in an ensemble of cells .",
    "again , one finds that the amount of enhancer affects the number of expressing cells but not the level of expression . in other words ,",
    "the enhancer increases the probability rather than the rate of transcription . in the experiments carried out by zlokarnik et al .",
    "@xcite , the reporter gene synthesizes the protein @xmath7-galactosidase . in unstimulared cells ,",
    "the number of these proteins is low , in the range 150 - 300 . under the action of the stimulating agent carbachol , rapid conversion to a state ,",
    "in which 15000 - 20000 @xmath7-lactonase molecules are present in a cell , is obtained .",
    "the major conclusion of the single cell experiments mentioned above is that in the systems considered , the cellular state is bistable .",
    "a cell can exist in two stable steady states : gene expression `` off / low '' and gene expression `` on '' with a high level of protein production .",
    "addition of inducer / enhancer to the system increases the fraction of cells in the `` high '' state . in the case of eukaryotic systems , however , the mechanism of enhancer action is not well understood .",
    "enhancers have been suggested to give rise to two major types of response .",
    "enhancers increase the rate of transcription through mainly enhancing the rate of close to open complex formation of rnap bound to the promoter region @xcite .",
    "the second type of response is of the `` all or none '' type @xcite .",
    "enhancers in this case do not increase the rate of transcription but increase the fraction of cells in the high state ( state 2 ) . the `` all or none '' phenomenon observed in some eukaryotic systems @xcite dose not involve autocatalysis explicitly .",
    "thus , a more general mechanism than in the case of prokaryotic systems is required to explain the bimodal distributions in protein levels in an ensemble of cells .",
    "we now consider the model of gene expression in the absence of inducer molecules .",
    "the values of m , the total number of reactions and n , the number of different types of biomolecules , are both thirteen . to explore the full parameter space",
    ", one has to treat the thirteen stochastic rate constants corresponding to the same number of reactions as variables .",
    "experimental results wherever they are available , show that the usual rate constants , @xmath52@xmath39 s , to which the stochastic rate constants @xmath96 s are related , can vary over a wide range depending on the type of gene and the nature of the cellular environment @xcite .",
    "since the exploration of the full parameter space is a daunting task , we report on some of the more general patterns of gene expression in a restricted subspace .",
    "the effect of changing the stochastic rate constants on specific patterns is also studied .",
    "we have included an optional feature in our model of gene expression , namely , cooperative binding of rnap to the promoter region p. the possibility of such a binding has been suggested earlier in a simplified probabilistic model of gene expression @xcite . in the present model ,",
    "cooperative binding implies that the rate constant for the binding of rnap at p is enhanced by a factor q if the binding event is immediately preceded by the reaction 6 in which a rnap clears the promoter region .",
    "cooperative binding of proteins to dna is now well established . in most cases of regulatory proteins",
    ", the binding cooperativity is mediated through protein - protein interaction although increasing evidence of dna mediated effects have been reported @xcite .",
    "some recent experiments on the prokaryotic system e. coli have shown that the transcriptional activity of the promoter is intrinsically sensitive to the superhelical density of the dna template @xcite .",
    "in fact as pointed out by mcclure@xcite , supercoiling gives rise to considerably more diversity in the patterns of promoter strength ( the ability to bind weakly or strongly ) than do mutations of auxiliary proteins .",
    "there is now experimental evidence that transcription generates increased negative supercoiling through several hundred base pairs@xcite . in principle",
    ", this can facilitate the binding of rnap to the dna or decrease the energy of activation required for the isomerization of rnap - promoter complex from closed to open form@xcite .",
    "thus , it is entirely plausible and likely that active transcription downstream of the promoter site may lead to increased binding of rnap ( cooperative binding ) and enhanced rate of open complex formation ( stochastic rate constants @xmath97 ) .",
    "we now describe three major types of gene expression pattern as a function of time . as",
    "before , the ga is applied to the system of thirteen biochemical reactions constituting the processes of transcription , translation and the regulation thereof . in the gene expression pattern designated as type",

    "<S> in this paper , we consider two stochastic models of gene expression in prokaryotic cells . in the first model , </S>",
    "<S> sixteen biochemical reactions involved in transcription , translation and transcriptional regulation in the presence of inducer molecules are considered . </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution of the number of biomolecules of a particular type is determined using the stochastic simulation method based on the gillespie algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained show that if the number of inducer molecules , @xmath0 , is greater than or equal to the number of regulatory molecules , @xmath1 the average protein level is high in the steady state ( state 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the level is the same as long as @xmath0 @xmath2 @xmath3 when @xmath0 is @xmath4 @xmath5 , the average protein level is low , practically zero ( state 1 ) . as @xmath0 increases , the protein level continues to remain low . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath0 becomes close to @xmath5 , protein levels in the steady state are intermediate between high and low . in the presence of autocatalysis </S>",
    "<S> , a cell mostly exists in either state 1 or state 2 giving rise to a bimodal distribution in the protein levels in an ensemble of cells . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to the `` all or none '' phenomenon observed in experiments . in the second model , the inducer molecules are not considered explicitly . </S>",
    "<S> an exhaustive simulation over the parameter space of the model shows that there are three major patterns of gene expression , type a , type b and type c. the effect of varying the cellular parameters on the patterns , in particular , the transition from one type of pattern to another , is studied . </S>",
    "<S> type a and type b patterns have been observed in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> simple mathematical models of transcriptional regulation predict type c pattern of gene expression in certain parameter regimes . </S>",
    "<S> the model studied by us includes all the major biochemical reactions involved in gene expression and the stochastic simulation results provide an understanding of the microscopic origins of the different patterns of gene expression .    </S>",
