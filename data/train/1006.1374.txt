    "a completely monotonic ( cm ) function is an infinitely differentiable function @xmath3 whose derivatives satisfy @xmath4 the definition is due to hausdorff  @xcite , and a collection of important properties can be found in @xcite .",
    "alzer and berg  @xcite state the following open problem . consider the function @xmath5 for what values of the parameter @xmath1 is @xmath6 completely monotonic ( cm ) ?",
    "a problem that is superficially similar to this problem has a remarkably simple solution  @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath7 is cm if and only if @xmath8 .",
    "although @xmath9 , the problems for @xmath10 and @xmath11 are essentially different , because a completely monotonic function must be positive and decreasing .",
    "a more completely descriptive name might be ` completely monotonically decreasing function ' , but the shorter name is now standard . in spite of the beautiful result for @xmath10 ,",
    "a consequence of the conjecture advanced here is that no similarly simple result applies to @xmath6 .",
    "alzer and berg  @xcite show that @xmath12 is cm .",
    "moreover , berg  @xcite has shown , through an equivalent problem , that @xmath13 is not cm .",
    "therefore , it has been conjectured that there exists a value @xmath14 such that @xmath6 is completely monotonic for all @xmath15 and not for @xmath16 .",
    "we obtain here experimentally an estimate for its value , namely @xmath17 .    in the field of experimental mathematics , there are several tools for identifying a real number with an expression containing known mathematical constants .",
    "we have applied these tools to @xmath14 , but without success .",
    "in this section we give a graphical and heuristic description of the method we use . for convenience ,",
    "we define the function @xmath18 and consider its properties for various fixed @xmath19 .",
    "we start with the case @xmath20 .",
    "figure [ fig:1](a ) shows plots of @xmath21 , or equivalently the second derivative of @xmath11 . for @xmath22 ,",
    "the function is clearly monotonic decreasing ; for @xmath23 , the function is clearly not monotonic .",
    "the transition occurs for @xmath24 , when @xmath25 has an inflexion point at @xmath26 , as shown .",
    "\\(a ) ( b )    the transitional case is further considered in figure [ fig:1](b ) , where the second , third and fourth derivatives are plotted . as could be anticipated from the shape of @xmath25 , its derivative @xmath27 touches the @xmath2-axis at @xmath28 .",
    "further , @xmath29 crosses the axis at the same point . from these observations",
    ", it is obvious that the pair of values @xmath30 satisfy the equations @xmath31    now consider the case @xmath32 . the above series of observations can be repeated for @xmath33 . again there is a range of values of @xmath1 for which the function is monotonic decreasing , and there is a critical pair @xmath30 such that @xmath34 is an inflexion point . solving the pair of equations @xmath35 gives @xmath36 , @xmath37 . in general",
    ", the function @xmath38 will be monotonic decreasing for @xmath1 ` small enough ' . from alzer and berg  @xcite",
    ", @xmath39 is always such a value .",
    "the change to non - monotonic behaviour will occur at a value @xmath40 when @xmath38 has an inflexion point at @xmath41 .",
    "the values of @xmath40 and @xmath41 can be determined from the equations @xmath42    we next consider how @xmath40 depends upon @xmath19 .",
    "we have seen already that @xmath43 , and @xmath44 . for all @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "this is so because if @xmath47 has an inflexion point , then @xmath48 must be non - monotonic .",
    "therefore , if one thinks of @xmath1 as increasing from @xmath39 , for which value all functions are monotonic , then @xmath49 must have become non - monotonic at a lower value of @xmath1 than that for which @xmath38 becomes non - monotonic .",
    "thus the sequence @xmath50 must be monotonically decreasing and it is bounded below by @xmath51 from the results in @xcite . therefore the limit @xmath52 exists and is the critical value of @xmath1 such that @xmath6 is completely monotonic for @xmath53 .",
    "in view of the above observations , we need to compute @xmath40 for a selection of values of @xmath19 and then extrapolate to compute the limit @xmath54 . in order to obtain a value of @xmath14 that is accurate enough to be submitted to tools such as plouffe s inverter  @xcite , we need to compute derivatives up to the order of @xmath55 .",
    "hence , an efficient method must be found to evaluate @xmath38 for large values of @xmath19 .",
    "symbolic differentiation becomes impossible after at most @xmath56 , depending upon the memory available on the computer used , implying the need for a numerical scheme .    by introducing the notation @xmath57 we can write @xmath58 , and obtain @xmath59 leibnitz s rule",
    "now allows us to compute recursively .",
    "@xmath60 the second term in the sum can be computed explicitly by introducing the following function .",
    "@xmath61 thus the computational form of ( [ eq : recurr ] ) becomes @xmath62 although it is possible to compute with this formula symbolically , expression swell prevents this approach from being useful for anything other than for error checking .",
    "if we assign numerical values to @xmath2 and @xmath1 and compute @xmath63 numerically , then ( [ eq : comp ] ) can evaluate derivatives numerically to orders @xmath64 or more .",
    "once the functions @xmath38 can be computed efficiently , the equations @xmath65 , @xmath66 can be solved to find the transition point in @xmath38 . for small values of @xmath19 , any method , for example maple s ` fsolve ` , can be used . for large @xmath19 ,",
    "extended precision must be used , owing to loss of precision through the accumulaton of cancellation and rounding errors . for @xmath19",
    "greater than @xmath67 the precision loss amounts to about 15 decimal digits .",
    "the equations were solved using bivariate newton iteration .",
    "the required derivatives with respect to @xmath1 can be computed using a method analogous to that above .",
    "in addition to cancelation errors , there is another reason for requiring extended precision . because @xmath68 is a repeated root of @xmath69 , newton iteration converges slowly and a nearly singular matrix",
    "must be inverted .",
    "therefore 60 decimal digits were used in the computations . for smaller @xmath19 ,",
    "maple was used , but became too slow for larger @xmath19 , and bailey s ` arprec `  @xcite and gnu gmp were used .",
    "table [ tab : one ] displays critical values computed between @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "each entry gives the smallest value of @xmath1 such that @xmath72 .",
    "that is , for each entry , @xmath73 .",
    ".[tab : one ] table of critical values . [ cols=\">,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     to extrapolate to @xmath54 , we examine @xmath74 as a function of @xmath75 .",
    "figure [ fig : extr ] shows a plot of @xmath40 against @xmath75 .",
    "we conjecture that @xmath74 obeys a relation @xmath76 by fitting a quadratic in @xmath75 using the data points @xmath77 , we obtain @xmath78 , where the error can be expected to be @xmath79 .",
    "this value was given to plouffe s inverter  @xcite , the inverse symbolic calculator  @xcite , and maple s ` identify ` command .",
    "no symbolic quantity matched all digits , and the closest symbolic quantities offered no immediate inspiration for analytic investigations .",
    "the simple solution to problem ( [ eq : known ] ) has led to several attempts to find an equally simple solution for ( [ eq : def ] ) .",
    "the numerical evidence presented suggests that such attempts will continue to fail .",
    "the numerical data obtained here does , however , suggest a number of simple properties which might help in an analytical solution to the problem .",
    "the dependence of @xmath41 on @xmath19 suggests a strongly linear correlation between @xmath80 and @xmath19 . a similar correlation between @xmath81 and",
    "@xmath75 has been noted above .",
