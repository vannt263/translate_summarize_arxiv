    "the goal of this letter is to put together all existing information on the amount of ionizing photons released by galaxies into the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , both from direct observations and from indirect estimations based on the effects of the igm ionization itself . in order to make an homogeneous comparison",

    ", we have to correct the observed lyc flux density @xmath18 for the photoelectric absorption by the neutral hydrogen remained in the igm : @xmath19 we may estimate @xmath16 from the observed uv flux density @xmath20 as follows : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the intrinsic lyc - to - uv flux density ratio and @xmath23 is the uv dust opacity in the interstellar medium of a galaxy .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath24 and @xmath25 this @xmath10 is called the lyc - to - uv escape flux density ratio in this letter . as found in equation ( 5 ) , we can obtain @xmath10 from the observed lyc - to - uv flux density ratio with a correction for the igm absorption against the lyc .",

    "a redshift dependence of @xmath10 is introduced .",
    "a key feature of equation ( 12 ) is that the lyc emissivity is directly related to the observed uv emissivity with the only parameter @xmath10 that we wish to determine . in other words ,",
    "our estimate for @xmath77 is free from uncertain dust correction and from the intrinsic lyc production rate ( or @xmath78 ) which depends on the initial mass function .",

    "thus , we also omit the thermal emission by the structure formation .",
    "the omission of the igm emissivity leads to an overestimate of @xmath10 that should be less than a factor of 2 .",
    "if we enter the igm opacity model described in  2.2 and the lyc emissivities described in  2.3 into equation ( 6 ) , we can predict the background intensity at the lyman limit as a function of @xmath10 .",

    "this comparison is performed by a non - parametric way from high to low redshift .",

    "the assumed initial redshifts in equation ( 6 ) are 5.0 , 5.0 , and 6.0 for the data from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , respectively .",
    "this choice does not affect the results if we take an enough high redshift because the igm opacity is very large at high redshift .",
    "in addition , we note that we assumed the higher opacity case at @xmath71 ( shown in fig .  1 as dashed line ) only for the data from @xcite .",

    "if we put confidence in the upper limit of @xcite at @xmath103 , which is an average value of @xmath10 for 11 star - forming galaxies and is less affected than a single measurement by the randomness of the lyc escape , we can obtain a possible evolution , for example , as @xmath104 from @xmath105 to @xmath106 , which is shown as the dashed line in fig .",
    "since the uncertainties are still very large , this rather strong evolution is just an example .",
    "however , we note that an evolution of @xmath10 is also found even in the high - emissivity case ( open symbols ) . such an increasing @xmath10 was suggested by @xcite in his fig .  1 although the redshift coverage is smaller than ours .",
    "the measurement by @xcite is somewhat larger than our estimations .",
    "this may be caused by their sample selection bias .",

    "we have discussed the escape flux density ratio of the lyc to the non - ionizing uv ( @xmath10 ) in a new framework for comparing the direct observations of the lyc from galaxies with the cosmic ionizing background intensity .",
    "we have found a redshift evolution of @xmath10 , with larger @xmath10 at higher redshifts . here , we translate @xmath10 into the escape fraction ( @xmath6 ) of ionizing photons from galaxies .    by equation ( 4 )",
    ", we can convert @xmath10 into @xmath6 if we have @xmath78 and @xmath23 . for normal stellar populations with the standard salpeter initial mass function and mass range 0.1100 @xmath108 , @xmath1090.3 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from the observed uv slope , @xmath1102 for the lyman break galaxies at @xmath107 ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ) although the uncertainty is very large . in this case , we have @xmath111 .",
    "if this relation is valid in the range @xmath06 , our result means that @xmath6 increases from a value less than 0.01 at @xmath3 to about @xmath4 at @xmath5 .",
    "if we explain the evolving @xmath10 by a constant @xmath6 , we have two possibilities according to equation ( 4 ) ; ( 1 ) an evolving @xmath78 and ( 2 ) an evolving @xmath23 .",
    "the evolving @xmath78 case needs an order of magnitude larger production rates of the lyc relative to the uv at @xmath5 than at @xmath3 .",
    "this might be realized by a top - heavy stellar initial mass function as suggested for zero metallicity , population iii ( popiii ) stars . very massive",
    "( @xmath112 @xmath108 ) popiii stars show almost black - body spectra with an effective temperature about @xmath113 k ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "however , such a transition of the mass function would occur at a much higher redshift than @xmath1154 because it is thought to happen at a very low metallicity like @xmath116 solar value ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although @xcite proposed that 1030% of stars in @xmath1174 star - forming galaxies are massive popiii stars , we would need more such stars to obtain an enough large @xmath78 .",
    "the evolving @xmath23 case needs an increment of 23 mag of @xmath23 from @xmath3 to @xmath5 .",
    "such a systematic increase of @xmath23 for galaxies at high redshifts is not reported , whereas @xcite reported an opposite trend for @xmath874 ( it may be caused by a selection bias in high redshift sample ) .",
    "we are therefore left with an evolution of @xmath6 , with a larger @xmath6 at a higher redshift .",
    "the escape of the lyc is probably a random phenomenon .",
    "thus , the evolving @xmath6 suggests an increase of the fraction of galaxies showing a large escape . according to theoretical studies ,",
    "a smaller galaxy can show a larger @xmath6 because of galactic winds @xcite and/or champagne flows @xcite .",
    "thus , the evolving @xmath6 may suggest a decrease at higher redshift of the average scale of galaxies , which is consistent with the cold dark matter scenario .",
    "the evolving @xmath6 also suggests a morphological evolution of galaxies ; at higher redshifts , a large fraction of galaxies would show very disturbed structure caused by galactic winds and/or champagne flows , yielding a large escape of the lyc .",
    "we note two issues which should be assessed in future .",
    "if there are a large number of type ii qsos at high redshifts as suggested by @xcite , the required @xmath10 may become much smaller . if the fraction of galaxies having a low - luminosity active galactic nucleus increases towards high redshifts as suggested by @xcite , a scenario with an evolving @xmath78 without an evolving @xmath6 may become possible .",
    "finally , we strongly encourage new direct measurements of the lyc from galaxies to confirm / reject the evolving @xmath10 . for @xmath107 ,",
    "the ground - based large telescopes are useful , and for @xmath103 , the _ galex _ satellite is appropriate .",
