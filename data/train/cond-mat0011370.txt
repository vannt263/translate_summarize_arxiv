    "we consider the current and density profiles in the steady state of the fully asymmetric simple - exclusion process ( fasep ) with open boundaries and different discrete - time updates , namely , ordered sequential , sublattice parallel and parallel .",
    "we remind the reader that the model describes a system of particles on a chain , hopping with probability @xmath0 only to empty nearest - neighbor sites to the right .",
    "each of the @xmath1 sites of the chain can be either empty or occupied by exactly one particle .",
    "open boundary conditions mean that at each time step ( update of the whole chain ) a particle is injected with probability @xmath2 at the left end of the chain ( @xmath3 ) , and removed with probability @xmath4 at the right end ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the definition of the model includes the choice of the stochastic dynamics , i.e. , the update scheme which specifies the order in which the local hopping , injection and particle removal are implemented .",
    "the case of random - sequential update is considered as a lattice automaton realization of the corresponding continuous - time process . in the general case",
    "it was solved first by using the recursion relations method @xcite , @xcite , and then by means of the elegant matrix - product ansatz ( mpa ) @xcite . as it was proven later @xcite ,",
    "the mpa is actually not an ansatz , but an exact representation of the stationary state of any one - dimensional system with random - sequential dynamics involving nearest - neighbor hoppings and single - site boundary terms .",
    "the method of mpa was next successfully applied for solving the following basic cases of true discrete - time dynamics : forward ordered sequential ( @xmath6 ) , backward ordered sequential ( @xmath7 ) @xcite , @xcite , and sublattice - parallel ( @xmath8 ) @xcite , @xcite , which turned out to be closely related @xcite .",
    "thus , the current has the same value in all these cases , @xmath9 ; the local densities at site @xmath10 for the fasep with forward , @xmath11 , and backward , @xmath12 , ordered sequential updates are simply related to each other , @xmath13 , and to the local density @xmath14 for the sublattice - parallel update @xcite @xmath15    in the cases of random - sequential , ordered sequential and sublattice parallel updates , the matrix - product representation involves infinite dimensional matrices which satisfy a particular quadratic algebra .",
    "finally , the most difficult case of fully parallel dynamics and open boundaries was solved by evans , rajewsky , and speer @xcite , by using site - oriented mpa with matrices satisfying a quartic algebra . moreover",
    ", these authors showed that the current and local densities for the model with parallel update can be simply mapped onto those for the previously solved discrete - time updates .",
    "an independent , bond - oriented mpa solution for the stationary fasep problem with parallel dynamics was found by de gier and nienhuis @xcite . in the case of general values of the hopping probability @xmath0",
    ", they have presented explicit expressions for the current and the discrete slope @xmath16 of density profile in all qualitatively different domains of the parameter space .    in our recent paper @xcite we have derived , independently of @xcite , @xcite , and by using a different method , exact expressions for the steady state current @xmath17 and the local density @xmath18 , @xmath10 , for the fasep on a finite chain with forward - ordered sequential dynamics and open boundaries .",
    "these expressions involve integrals which at large @xmath1 and large distance from the chain ends are of the laplace type , hence , they are convenient for asymptotic analysis .",
    "we point out that from the simple mapping @xcite of the above quantities onto the current @xmath19 and local density @xmath20 for the model with parallel update , @xmath21 exact new representations for @xmath19 and @xmath20 follow , which do not contain complicated combinatorial expressions as those obtained by evans , rajewsky , and speer .",
    "we shall present here exact expressions for the local density profiles of the model on a semi - infinite chain with either left - hand ( l ) endpoint , @xmath22 or right - hand ( r ) endpoint , @xmath23 in the former case the limit @xmath24 is taken at fixed @xmath25 , which labels the sites of the chain from its left end to the right . in the latter case",
    "the limit @xmath24 is taken at fixed @xmath26 , which labels the sites of the chain from its right end to the left . note that for fixed hopping probability @xmath0 , and any point @xmath27 on the phase diagram , see fig .  1",
    ", the right - hand profile @xmath28 is closely related to the left - hand profile @xmath29 for the point which is symmetrically positioned with respect to the diagonal @xmath30 .",
    "indeed , by taking the @xmath24 limit in the symmetry relation for a finite chain @xcite , @xmath31 , one obtains that @xmath32 therefore , it suffices to derive explicit expressions for the local densities @xmath33 and @xmath34 for , say , @xmath35 , i.e. , in the maximum - current and low - density phases .",
    "moreover , by applying the @xmath36 limit form of the mapping ( [ m1 ] ) with @xmath37 fixed at a finite distance from one of the chain ends ( e ) , @xmath38 to the results for @xmath39 , one obtains the corresponding expressions for @xmath40 , @xmath25 , e = l , r .",
    "we emphasize that the resulting expressions for the density profiles on semi - infinite chains are much simpler than those on finite chains , and they again involve integrals which are of the laplace type for large distances from the chain end .",
    "hence , their asymptotic behavior is readily deduced . in order to make precise comparison with the asymptotic expansions for the right - hand local density profiles obtained in @xcite",
    ", one has to take into account that there , before taking the limit @xmath24 , the sites are labeled from the right end of the chain to the left by @xmath41 , rather than by @xmath42 , as in our definition ( [ rightp ] ) . by comparing the large @xmath43 asymptotic behavior of @xmath44 , obtained via the mapping ( [ m2 ] ) , with the corresponding results of evans , rajewsky and speer @xcite for @xmath45 with @xmath46 , we find complete agreement in all but two cases , in which we correct technical errors in the final asymptotic expressions ( 9.22 ) and ( 9.28 ) given there .",
    "the expressions for the slope of the density profile derived in @xcite for general values of the hopping probability @xmath0 actually represent the leading - order asymptotic form of @xmath47 that follows from our expressions for the local density @xmath48 @xcite in the semi - infinite chain limit @xmath36 and in the leading - order expansion in finite but large @xmath49 , see the results and comments below . for recent general reviews on the mpa ,",
