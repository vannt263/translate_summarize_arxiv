    "consider a charged vector boson , which propagates in the coulomb field created by a heavy point - like charge @xmath1 assuming that the boson is massive , its mass being produced via the higgs mechanism ; the @xmath0-bosons give an example .",
    "we study relativistic effects in this coulomb problem . a situation where they can be important arises , for example , for small primordial charged black holes since an impact of their coulomb field on a @xmath2-boson prevails over the gravitational field .",
    "it has `` always '' been known that there is a difficulty in the coulomb problem for vector bosons .",
    "soon after proca formulated theory for vector particles @xcite it became clear that it produces inadequate results for the coulomb problem @xcite .",
    "this fact inspired corben and schwinger @xcite to modify the proca theory , tuning the lagrangian and equations of motion in such a way as to force the hyromagnetic ratio of the vector boson to acquire a favorable value @xmath3 . later on the formalism of @xcite",
    "was found to have a connection with the non - abelian gauge theory @xcite , which makes it relevant for the present day studies .",
    "a role of the identity @xmath3 was thoroughly discussed in literature , see e. g. ref.@xcite .",
    "ref.@xcite found a realistic discrete energy spectrum for the coulomb problem for vector bosons .",
    "however , it discovered also a fundamental flaw in the problem . for two series of quantum states the charge of the vector boson located on the coulomb center turns infinite , which indicates the fall of the boson on the center .",
    "one of these series has the total angular momentum zero , @xmath4 , another one has @xmath5 ( being further specified by a label `` @xmath6 '' , see section [ j>0 ] ) .",
    "this effect takes place for arbitrary small value of the coulomb charge @xmath1 , which is physically unacceptable .",
    "moreover , it takes place at small distances , while the renormalizability of the standard model ref.@xcite guarantees that there should be no problems of this type .",
    "all this indicates that the coulomb problem is poorly defined .",
    "moreover , there exists a contradiction ; the coulomb problem derived from the standard model produces results , which challenge the model itself .",
    "this difficulty was inspirational for several lines of research .",
    "early efforts are summarized in ref.@xcite .",
    "more recent refs . suggested a new , refined modification of the formalism for vector bosons .",
    "ref.@xcite claimed that it complies with results of corben and schwinger .",
    "some authors considered other forms of the equation governing vector bosons , which produce more acceptable results for the coulomb problem , but this advantage is partially undermined by the fact that it does not step from a renormalizable theory .",
    "however , in spite of a progress made over the years , there still exists a contradiction between the difficulty in the coulomb problem for vector bosons and the renormalizability of the standard model .",
    "we find a clear way to resolve this contradiction , formulating the coulomb problem for vector particles properly , within the frames of the standard model .",
    "our main observation is that the polarization of the qed vacuum has a profound impact in the problem forcing the density of charge of a vector boson to decrease at the origin , thus making the coulomb problem stable , well defined .",
    "this decrease has an exponential character for the @xmath4 state . for the @xmath5,``@xmath6 '' state",
    "the suppression is of a power - type . in both these states",
    "the suppression eradicates the difficulty of the coulomb problem .    from the first glance",
    "this result looks surprising . presumably , the vacuum polarization is meant to make the attractive coulomb field only stronger , which should result in an increase of the charge density at the origin .",
    "in addition to this , the vacuum polarization for spinor and scalar particles in the coulomb field is known to produce only small , perturbative effects .",
    "in contrast , we claim a strong _ reduction _ of the charge density for the vector particle .",
    "to grasp a physical mechanism involved it is necessary to notice that the equation of motion for vector particles incorporates a particular term , which explicitly depends on the external current and has no counterparts for scalars and spinors , see the last term in eq.([form ] ) .",
    "precisely this term brings in a strong effective repulsion , which stems from the vacuum polarization and makes the coulomb problem stable , well defined .",
    "the renormalizability of the standard model means that if all essential processes are taken care of , then the infinite charge of a vector boson located at the coulomb center is eliminated .",
    "it is known that the amplitude of the photon exchange between leptons or / and quarks at high transferred momenta should be considered alongside exchange by the higgs and @xmath1-bosons . from this perspective",
    "the catastrophic behavior of the charge density of a vector boson at small distance , i. e. at large transferred momenta , in the coulomb problem could have been considered as an indication that the coulomb problem for vector bosons should include the processes related to the higgs and @xmath1-bosons exchange from the very beginning .",
    "in contrast to this widely spread presumption we find a way to formulate the coulomb problem for vector bosons entirely in terms of the @xmath2 and electromagnetic fields , as a pure qed problem .",
    "a complete standard model calculation , where all possible processes are accounted for accurately , would require specific information on the nature of a heavy particle that creates the coulomb field , i. e. on all its quantum numbers related to the standard model .",
    "this information is not necessarily feasible .",
    "a simple example give primordial black holes ; it is not easy to assert with certainty whether they have , or have not the weak charge , and what are their other quantum numbers in the standard model .",
    "same questions arise in relation to other possible candidates for the heavy coulomb center . as a result",
    ", a presumption that the exchange of the higgs and @xmath1-boson should play a basic role in the coulomb problem leads to complications .",
    "it is fortunate therefore that the detailed information on properties of the heavy particle proves be redundant , that the coulomb problem can be properly defined using the only physical parameter of a heavy particle , its electric charge .",
    "this point of view , which is advocated in the present work keeps the coulomb problem simple and transparent . on the other hand",
    ", it also allows one to include all other processes , which are left outside the scope of the coulomb problem , by means of perturbation theory .",
    "our preliminary calculations indicate that the exchange by the higgs and @xmath1-bosons , as well as possible processes with lepton or quark exchange , give only small corrections .",
    "the reason stems from the fact that the found wave functions for vector bosons are suppressed at small distances .",
    "consequently , the small - distance processes with the exchange by higgs and @xmath1-bosons are also suppressed ( the exchange by a lepton or quark contains the vanishing at the coulomb center fields , which describe the @xmath2-boson ) .    in section [ vector ]",
    "the corben - schwinger formalism for charged vector bosons is derived directly from the standard model .",
    "the pure coulomb problem is discussed in sections [ nonrel]-[catastroph ] and several appendixes .",
    "this analyses follows ref.@xcite , but some important details , including the non - relativistic limit ( section [ nonrel ] ) and the eigenvalue problem for @xmath4 states ( section [ matrix ] ) are discussed in more detail .",
    "sections [ vacuum_polarization],[numericals ] present the main result of the paper .",
    "they show that the qed vacuum polarization plays a defining role in the problem , as was first noticed in our previous work @xcite .",
    "the units @xmath7 , @xmath8 where @xmath9 , are used below .",
    "consider boson fields in the electroweak part of the lagrangian of the standard model , see e.g. ref.@xcite , @xmath10 here @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the triplet of @xmath13 and the @xmath14 gauge potentials respectively ( abridged notation is used here ) .",
    "the covariant derivative @xmath15 takes into account that the higgs field @xmath16 has a hypercharge @xmath17 , which describes its interaction with the @xmath14 field , and is transformed as a doublet under the @xmath13 gauge transformations .",
    "taking the unitary gauge one can present it via one real component @xmath18 assuming that the scalar field develops the vacuum expectation value @xmath19 and the higgs mechanism takes place , one finds that the gauge field can be presented as a new @xmath14 field @xmath20 , and a triplet of massive fields @xmath21 @xmath22 here @xmath23 represents the @xmath2-boson with charge @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the weinberg angle .",
    "expanding the lagrangian eq.([gauge ] ) in the vicinity of @xmath19 and retaining only bilinear in the fields @xmath26 terms , including their interaction with the electromagnetic field , one derives an effective lagrangian @xmath27 which describes the propagation of @xmath2-bosons in an external electromagnetic field . here",
    "@xmath28 is the mass of @xmath2 .",
    "the external field is accounted for in eq.([w ] ) in the derivative @xmath29 and by the term with the field @xmath30 .",
    "the first and the last terms in eq.([w ] ) are present in the proca formalism @xcite , while the second one was introduced by corben and schwinger @xcite .    from eq.([w ] ) one derives the classical lagrange equation of motion for vector bosons @xmath31 here an identity @xmath32=ief_{\\mu\\nu}$ ] was used . taking a covariant derivative in eq.([wave ] )",
    "one finds @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the external current , which creates the external field @xmath35 .",
    "evaluating @xmath36 from eq.([lgauge ] ) and substituting the result back into eq.([wave ] ) one rewrites the latter one in a more transparent form @xmath37 this equation of motion for vector bosons was suggested in ref.@xcite .",
    "the coefficient 2 in front of the second term ensures that the g - factor of the boson takes the value @xmath3 , see eq.([moment ] ) below .",
    "the derivation outlined shows that eq.([form ] ) represents the classical equation of motion for @xmath2-bosons in the external electromagnetic field , which is valid within the frames of the standard model .",
    "this equation has similarities with the klein - gordon and dirac equations ( if the latter one is written as the second - order differential equation ) , but there is also an important distinction .",
    "it is produced by the last term in eq.([form ] ) , which explicitly contains the external current ; there is no similar terms for scalars and spinors .",
    "we will see how important this term is , when we discuss the vacuum polarization .",
    "we will use below a current of vector bosons @xmath38 , which can be obtained by considering a variation of the lagrangian eq.([w ] ) under variation of @xmath20 , which yields @xmath39 differentiating in eq.([j3 ] ) term by term and taking into account eq.([lgauge ] ) one verifies that @xmath40 using this result , the current eq.([jjj ] ) can be written in a compact form @xmath41 here @xmath42 refers to two complex conjugated terms .      consider a static electric field described by the electric potential @xmath43 and charge density @xmath44 . for",
    "a stationary state of the @xmath2-boson one can presume that @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the energy of the stationary state , and @xmath47 is the potential energy of the @xmath2-boson in the electric field .",
    "eq.([lgauge ] ) in this case gives @xmath48 the four - vector @xmath49 is presented here via the three - vector @xmath50 and the modifies zeroth - component @xmath51 . in order to simplify notation",
    "we introduce also a very important for us quantity @xmath52 , @xmath53 eqs.([lgauge]),([sta ] ) show that this definition complies with ( [ simp ] ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath54 appears in the equations of motion alongside the initial potential @xmath55 , see e.g. eq.([simp ] ) . in this sense it plays a role of an effective potential energy , which is specific for vector bosons",
    ". we will call it the @xmath54-term , or @xmath54-potential . in this notation eq.([form ] ) reads @xmath56 a relation between @xmath57 and @xmath50 given by eq.([simp ] ) shows that among four equations of motion eqs.([wa]),([0 ] ) only three are independent , precisely what one expects for massive vector particles .",
    "it will be useful to present eq.([wa ] ) in a slightly different form , which can be derived by combining it with eq.([simp ] ) and using an identity @xmath58 , which gives @xmath59 from the expression for the current of vector bosons eq.([jw ] ) one derives the charge density @xmath60      the behavior of vector bosons in the homogeneous magnetic fields was studied in detail , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "the spectrum of this problem reads , see section [ homo ] , @xmath61 here @xmath62 specifies the landau levels , and @xmath63 gives a projection of spin @xmath64 of the vector boson .",
    "eq.([e2 ] ) shows that vector bosons possess the magnetic moment @xmath65 which means that the magnetic @xmath66-factor is @xmath3 .",
    "consider a vector boson in a static electric field with the potential energy @xmath67 .",
    "if we presume that the non - relativistic approach is valid , which needs that @xmath68 , then in the lowest order of the perturbation theory in powers of @xmath69 one immediately finds from eqs.([wa]),([simp ] ) @xmath70 here @xmath71 is the energy , the vector @xmath72 plays a role of the wave function for the vector boson , and the non - relativistic hamiltonian on the right - hand side has a usual form for a massive charged particle .",
    "let us find corrections to eq.([nonrel ] ) induced by relativistic effects .",
    "the wave function of the massive vector particle @xmath73 is well defined in the rest frame .",
    "therefore the vector @xmath72 , which describes the moving vector particle , inevitably deviates from the wave function @xmath74 .",
    "a relation between @xmath72 and @xmath75 is easy to articulate for the free motion , when it is given by the lorentz boost , see e.g. a book @xcite , @xmath76 generically , the potential energy brings in complications , but within the necessary accuracy we can neglect them , presuming also that @xmath77 .",
    "then eq.([fw ] ) gives @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "this relation plays a role similar to the foldy - wouthuysen transformation @xcite for fermions .    substituting eq.([fwapp ] ) in eqs.([wa]),([simp ] ) and expanding the latter ones in powers of @xmath69 one finds the following schrdinger - type equation for the wave function @xmath74 of the vector boson @xmath80 here @xmath81 label components of three - vectors , @xmath82 is the spin , which operates on a vector @xmath83 according to @xmath84 .",
    "the relativistic correction to the hamiltonian @xmath85 of vector particles is given in eq.([dh ] ) .",
    "it is instructive to compare this correction with the known darwin hamiltonian @xmath86 , which accounts for relativistic effects for spinor particles @xmath87 here @xmath88 is the operator of spin for spinor particles .",
    "the three terms in the first line of eq.([dh ] ) resemble their counterparts in eq.([d ] ) , the only distinction is the numerical coefficient in front of the term with @xmath89 .",
    "we conclude that these three terms have conventional meaning , describing the relativistic correction to the kinetic energy , the spin - orbit interaction , and the contact correction to the potential . the coefficient in front of the term responsible for the spin - orbit interaction in eq.([hami ] )",
    "complies with the hyromagnetic ratio @xmath3 of the vector boson , if one presumes that the thomas `` one - half rule '' is applicable for vector particles the same way as for spinors .",
    "the last , forth term in eq.([dh ] ) finds no counterpart in the darwin hamiltonian .",
    "it is instructive to write a contribution of this term to the energy shift @xmath90 eqs.([de]),([q ] ) show that @xmath91 plays a role of the density of the quadrupole moment for vector bosons .",
    "we conclude that the last , forth term in eq.([dh ] ) indicates that vector bosons have a quadruple moment .    from the first glance the contact and the quadrupole terms in the eq.([dh ] ) have similarity with the @xmath54-term in eq.([ups ] ) . however this resemblance is coincidental , since the @xmath54-term does not contribute to ( [ dh ] ) , which takes into account corrections of the order of @xmath92 . eq.([ups ] ) allows to estimate the @xmath54-potential as @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the bohr radius .",
    "the @xmath54-potential comes into the equation of motion with the factor @xmath95 , see the last term in eq.([wa ] ) .",
    "eq.([simp ] ) gives an estimate @xmath96 .",
    "overall , an estimate for the correction produced by the @xmath54-term in eq.([wa ] ) is @xmath97 , which means that the @xmath54-term is too small to contribute to eq.([dh ] ) .",
    "thus , the contact and quadrupole interactions in eq.([dh ] ) have no direst connection with the @xmath54-term .",
    "this fact makes a difference in coefficients in front of the contact term in eq.([dh ] ) and the @xmath54-term in eq.([ups ] ) acceptable .",
    "in particular , the fact that they have opposite signs produces no contradiction .",
    "consider the pure coulomb field , presuming that it is created by a point - like heavy object with charge @xmath98 .",
    "then for @xmath99 one has @xmath100 the second identity here follows from eq.([ups ] ) .",
    "let us treat the coulomb problem using the non - relativistic perturbation theory .",
    "take the non - relativistic eq.([nonrel ] ) as a starting point , and consider the hamiltonian eq.([dh ] ) as a perturbation .",
    "conventional calculations , see appendix [ appendix ] , lead to the following result for the shift of the energy level characterized by the main quantum number @xmath101 , orbital momentum @xmath102 and total angular momentum @xmath103 @xmath104 this formula is similar to the one that describes the energy shifts for spinor particles ; the only distinction comes from values of @xmath105 in eq.([nlj ] ) , which are integers for vector particles and half - integers for spinors .",
    "the order of several lowest levels shows the following pattern @xmath106 here the atomic - like notation @xmath107 is adopted , the brackets combine together the degenerate energy levels .",
    "consider the static central electric field ( the coulomb problem gives an important example ) .",
    "the conservation of the total angular momentum @xmath105 in this field allows one to separate the angular variables .",
    "we will use for this purpose the electric , longitudinal and magnetic spherical vectors , @xmath108 defined conventionally , see @xcite and appendix [ spherical ] .",
    "generically , one can present the vector @xmath72 as a linear combination of three spherical vectors with the given value of @xmath105 .",
    "it is convenient to refer to the three terms in this combination as the electric , longitudinal and magnetic modes ( or polarizations ) of a vector boson .",
    "the parity conservation simplifies the problem further on .",
    "the state with the magnetic polarization , which parity is different from the parity of other two modes , is not coupled with these modes . therefore the magnetically polarized mode can be written in a simple form @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the radial function .",
    "the two modes related to electric and longitudinal polarizations have same parity , which makes coupling between these modes possible .",
    "one needs therefore to consider them on the same footing assuming that @xmath111 where @xmath112",
    ". we will refer to them as electro - longitudinal modes , or polarizations .      for the magnetic mode the angular momentum",
    "is restricted @xmath113 ( the magnetic spherical vector is not defined for @xmath4 , see eq.([y ] ) ) . substituting eq.([linm ] ) into eq.([wa ] ) one finds the following equation for the radial function @xmath114 @xmath115 here @xmath116 is @xmath117 the form of eq.([wcoulomb ] ) coincides with the klein - gordon equation .",
    "therefore the spectrum of the magnetic mode replicates the spectrum of scalar particles , which is given by the sommerfeld formula @xmath118 here @xmath119 in eq.([mspe ] ) @xmath120 plays a role of the main quantum number . in the non - relativistic limit the magnetic mode corresponds to the states @xmath121 .",
    "consider electro - longitudinal polarizations , when the vector @xmath122 is given by eq.([linel ] ) .",
    "substituting it into eqs.([wa]),([simp ] ) and using the properties of the spherical vectors from appendix [ spherical ] one finds a system of coupled equations for radial functions @xmath123 @xmath124 here @xmath125 denotes the radial part of @xmath57 . using eq.([simp ] ) one finds for it @xmath126 eqs.([sys1]),([sys2 ] ) are sufficient to define the functions @xmath123 , but it is convenient to compliment them by the radial form of eq.([0 ] ) , which reads @xmath127 let us verify first that eqs.([sys1]),([sys2 ] ) describe two different modes .",
    "consider with this purpose distances so small that @xmath128 , where the potential energy dominates over mass . in this region eqs.([sys1]),([sys2 ] ) reduce to @xmath129 one derives from eqs.([sim1]),([sim2 ] ) that there exists a mode , in which at small distances @xmath130 is small , @xmath131 , which means that in this region the polarization is predominantly electric . from eq.([sim1 ] ) one finds that this mode satisfies the following asymptotic conditions at @xmath132 @xmath133 we will call it the `` @xmath134 '' mode below .    in order to find the second mode let us assume the following asymptotic behavior for @xmath132 @xmath135 substituting eqs.([anu]),([bnu ] ) in eqs.([sim1]),([sim2 ] ) one finds a system of two homogeneous linear equations , in which @xmath136 plays a role of the eigenvalue",
    ". solving this system one finds @xmath136 and the ratio @xmath137 , deriving @xmath138 this mode will be referred to as the `` @xmath6 '' mode @xcite .",
    "let us find now the discrete energy spectrum .",
    "introduce a function @xmath139 @xmath140 here eq.([divwrad ] ) was used in the second identity .",
    "taking the corresponding linear combination of eqs.([sys1]),([w0 ] ) one finds that @xmath66 satisfies the klein - gordon equation @xmath141 this result leaves only two options ; either @xmath66 equals zero identically , or , alternatively , the spectrum of electro - longitudinal modes can be found from eq.([dchi ] ) .",
    "the first alternative takes place for @xmath4 , when only the longitudinal mode is present .",
    "the function @xmath142 in this case should be taken as zero , which makes zero also the function @xmath66 in eq.([chi ] ) .",

    "an interesting method , which allows one to `` invent '' the substitution eq.([for ] ) and derive then eq.([h2 ] ) is presented in appendix [ matrix ] .",
