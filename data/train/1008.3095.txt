    "in the last few years , many mathematical efforts have been devoted to variational problems arising in the modelling of phase transitions in solids , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "these problems often involve singularly perturbed functionals of the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 represents the displacement of an elastic body @xmath3 , @xmath4 is a small parameter , and @xmath5 is a ( nonnegative ) free energy density with multiple minima corresponding to martensitic materials . due to the multiple well structure ,",
    "nucleation of phases in a given configuration may occur without increasing @xmath6 , so that the free energy may admit many ( eventually constrained ) minimizers . in order to select preferred configurations , the van der waals - cahn - hilliard theory adds higher order terms leading to functionals of the form . in such functionals",
    "a competition occurs between the two terms : the free energy favors gradients close to a minimum value of @xmath5 , while @xmath7 penalizes transitions from one minima to another .",
    "the @xmath0-convergence method provides a suitable framework to study the asymptotic behavior of singularly perturbed energies like @xmath8 ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for a more detailed overview of this subject ) .",
    "one of the first applications of @xmath0-convergence was actually obtained in @xcite in the context of fluid - fluid phase transitions ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . here",
    "the authors deal with energy functionals of the form @xmath9 where the potential @xmath5 has a double well structure , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath10 . it is shown that such family of energies @xmath0-converges ( in a suitable topology ) as @xmath11 to a functional which calculates the area of the interface between the two phases @xmath12 and @xmath13 , for limiting @xmath14-functions @xmath15 with values in @xmath16 . since then",
    "this result has been generalized in many different ways ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) , in particular in  @xcite for an intermediate situation where the singular perturbation @xmath17 is replaced by the higher order term   @xmath18 .",
    "the first @xmath0-convergence result for functionals acting on gradient vector fields has been obtained in  @xcite .",
    "assuming that @xmath19 for some rank - one connected matrices @xmath20 and",
    "@xmath21 ( and some additional constitutive conditions on @xmath5 ) , the authors prove the @xmath0-convergence of @xmath8 as @xmath22 .",
    "once again the effective functional returns the total area of the interfaces separating the phases @xmath20 and @xmath21 , for limiting functions @xmath23 satisfying @xmath24 a.e . and @xmath25 . here the rank - one connection between the wells @xmath20 and @xmath21 turns out to be necessary for the existence of non - affine @xmath23 s satisfying @xmath24 , and the interfaces must be planar and oriented according to the connection , see  @xcite",
    "we also mention recent developments on weakening the condition on the wells of @xmath5 to allow for frame indifference , _",
    "i.e. _ , assuming the zero level set of @xmath5 of the form @xmath26 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "another topic of increasing interest related to solid mechanics concerns thin elastic films .",
    "it is well known that thin films may have different mechanical properties from bulk materials , specifically for martensitic ones .",
    "those properties are important for many physical applications ( see @xcite ) . in this context",
    ", the @xmath0-convergence point of view is again suitable to rigorously derive limiting models starting from 3d nonlinear elasticity .",
    "this has been shown in @xcite for the membrane theory , and more recently in  @xcite for nonlinear plate models . in the regime of membranes ,",
    "several studies have focused their attention on the impact of a higher order perturbation on the behavior of thin films .",
    "the first variational approach has been addressed in @xcite where the authors add the singular perturbation @xmath27 to the free energy @xmath6 for a domain of small thickness @xmath28 .",
    "they obtain in the limit @xmath29 a 2d energy density which depends on the deformation gradient of the mid - surface , and the cosserat vector @xmath30 which gives an asymptotic description of the out - of - plane deformation",
    ". an important consequence of the results of @xcite is that for many interesting materials the low energy states in the thin film limit are indeed different from the ones in three dimensional samples .",
    "however @xcite does not treat possible correlations between the thickness @xmath28 and the parameter  @xmath31 .",
    "this issue was first conducted in @xcite , and more intensively in @xcite to keep track of the cosserat vector .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the limiting model is determined by the asymptotic ratio @xmath32 as @xmath29 and @xmath11 , and it depends whether @xmath33 , @xmath34 , or @xmath35 .",
    "the general idea of this paper is to study a simple class of singularly perturbed functionals describing phase transitions in thin films . in this direction ,",
    "some models have been recently analyzed , see @xcite , and also @xcite for models without singular perturbation leading to sharp interfaces .",
    "here we want to carry out an analysis in the spirit of @xcite focusing on possible correlations between the strength of an interfacial energy and the thickness of the film . as in @xcite",
    "we consider a _",
    " membrane scaling \" _ , and we introduce the normalized functional @xmath36 defined for @xmath37 by @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and the mid - surface @xmath41 is a bounded _",
    "open set ( here convexity is assumed for simplicity , and we refer to @xcite for more general geometries ) .",
    "considering configurations @xmath42 with energy of order @xmath31 , that is @xmath43 , and renormalizing by @xmath44 we are led to the energy @xmath45 in the thin domain @xmath46 .",
    "we are interested in the variational convergence of the family @xmath47 as @xmath48 and @xmath22 . to this aim",
    ", we introduce the standard rescaling @xmath49 which yields functionals @xmath50 defined for @xmath51 by @xmath52 where @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is the rescaled gradient operator .",
    "our main goal is to perform the @xmath0-convergence as @xmath22 and @xmath29 of the family @xmath50 in the simplest context where we can illustrate a difference between the behavior of thin films and bulk materials .",
    "the class of models we have in mind involves double - well potentials @xmath5 of the type considered in @xcite . in other words",
    ", @xmath5 should be structurally similar to @xmath55 a situation where a qualitatively different behavior from @xcite is expected is when @xmath20 and @xmath21 are not rank - one connected , but @xmath56 and @xmath57 are .",
    "here we denote by @xmath56 and @xmath57 the @xmath58 matrices extracted by taking the first two columns from @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively . in this case , sequences with bounded @xmath59 energy , as in @xcite , converge to affine maps by the results in @xcite .",
    "but , as it will be made precise below , this rigidity effect might not occur for sequences with bounded @xmath60 energy since @xmath56 and @xmath57 are compatible on the mid - surface .",
    "accordingly , we assume that @xmath61 is continuous and satisfies the following first set of assumptions :    * @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are distinct matrices satisfying @xmath65 for some @xmath66 and @xmath67 ; * @xmath68 , for @xmath69 and some constant @xmath70 .    under the conditions @xmath71 and @xmath72 , we shall derive compactness properties for sequences with uniformly bounded energy . in our",
    "setting the limiting configurations space turns out to be @xmath73 where we write @xmath74 . throughout the paper",
    "we identify pairs @xmath75 with functions defined on the mid - surface @xmath76 , that is @xmath77 , @xmath78 with @xmath79 .",
    "in particular , for any @xmath75 , we can write @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a set of finite perimeter in @xmath76 , and @xmath82 denotes its characteristic function . for @xmath83",
    "the ( reduced ) boundary of @xmath84 consists of countably many planar interfaces with normal @xmath85 , while @xmath84 is an arbitrary set of finite perimeter in @xmath76 if @xmath86 ( see theorem [ thm : bj ] , and @xcite ) . let us recall that , in our setting , @xmath20 and @xmath21 might _ not _ be rank - one connected , so that we shall have to construct recovery sequences substantially different from @xcite .",
    "we also emphasize that for @xmath86 , the arbitrary geometry of the interface is again in sharp contrast with @xcite , where interfaces must be made by hyperplanes .",
    "the general compactness result is formulated in theorem  [ thm : compactness ] below . as a matter of fact",
    "this theorem does not provide optimal compactness ( only ) in the case @xmath87 .",
    "indeed , in this regime we may expect a separation of scales to hold and the film to behave like a three dimensional sample .",
    "thus , if the wells are not compatible in the bulk , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath88 , it is reasonable to believe that sequences with bounded energy should converge to trivial limits .",
    "this question will be addressed in the last section with _ positive _ results for some particular cases ( see theorems  [ rigidrank ] and [ rigidrank2 ] ) .",

    "taking into account , we also notice that these assumptions are clearly satisfied for @xmath123 with @xmath124 .",
    "let us finally mention that similar assumptions are already present in  @xcite .",
    "condition @xmath125 is a standard non - degeneracy condition on @xmath5 near the wells , while @xmath119 allows one to construct lower dimensional optimal profiles connecting the two phases @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",

    "to simplify the notation , we introduce the 2d energy density @xmath139 given by @xmath140 which is a double - well potential with zero level set @xmath141 .",

    "in contrast with the critical regime , one may expect the case @xmath152 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath153 ) to lead to a simpler behavior with respect to the @xmath151-variable by separation of scales .",
    "indeed , the energies formally behave like two dimensional ones , and optimal transition layers should only depend on the distance to the interface by assumptions @xmath154 .",
    "we will illustrate this fact with more details in section  [ sectsub ] ( see remark [ sepscales ] ) .",
    "our results for this regime give a positive answer to our formal discussion , and they can be summarized in the following theorem .",

    "<S> * abstract . * motivated by solid - solid phase transitions in elastic thin films , we perform a @xmath0-convergence analysis for a singularly perturbed energy describing second order phase transitions in a domain of vanishing thickness . under a two - wells assumption , </S>",
    "<S> we derive a sharp interface model with an interfacial energy depending on the asymptotic ratio between the characteristic length scale of the phase transition and the thickness of the film . in each case , the interfacial energy is determined by an explicit optimal profile problem . </S>",
    "<S> this asymptotic problem entails a nontrivial dependance on the thickness direction when the phase transition is created at the same rate as the thin film , while it shows a separation of scales if the thin film is created at a faster rate than the phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> the last regime , when the phase transition is created at a faster rate than the thin film , is more involved . </S>",
    "<S> depending on growth conditions of the potential and the compatibility of the two phases , we either obtain a sharp interface model with scale separation , or a trivial situation driven by rigidity effects . </S>"
