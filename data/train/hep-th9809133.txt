    "during the last few years new light was shed on gauge theories via world volume field theories on d  branes stretched between two ns5 or d  branes , in iia or iib string theories @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) . in particular , the brane configurations of @xmath3 , @xmath0 super yang  mills ( sym ) and super qcd were analyzed .",
    "the m theory versions of those theories , living on the m5 brane @xcite , give a powerful new tool to deal with those theories ( it should be stressed , though , that the m theory versions are not identical to the original theories , although they lie in the same universality class ) . in particular , the identification of the qcd string as an m2 membrane ending on the m5 @xcite , enables the calculation of the quark anti  quark potential via the mqcd string tension @xcite .",
    "the leading order of the potential was found to be linear in the separation @xmath4 between the quark anti ",
    "quark pair , @xmath5 .",
    "this result which is valid , of course , only for large separations , ( for @xmath6 where the meson is `` stretched '' ) , is an indication of confinement .    in this note",
    "we  measure \" the potential with higher precision than that of @xcite .",
    "we derive the nambu ",
    "goto action that corresponds to an @xmath7 gauge theories . in the case of @xmath8",
    "we explicitly determine the sub  leading terms of the potential dependence on @xmath4 , in the limit @xmath9 ( in m theory units ) .",
    "we find that the corrections to the linear term include a constant term , and a term exponentially small with characteristic length of @xmath1 .",
    "we must remark , though , that because the mqcd string is not a bps state , its tension is not protected when we vary the parameters of the theory .",
    "similar nature of the sub ",
    "leading corrections to the potential are also detected in calculations involving mqcd setups that correspond to softly broken @xmath10 sym theory .",
    "our work involves calculations similar to ones performed recently in the context of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite@xcite .",
    "it turns out that the next to leading corrections found in our analysis are of the same nature of those found in a supergravity setup that corresponds to the pure four dimensional ym theory @xcite .",
    "we also find no trace of a @xmath11 lscher @xcite term correction which is believed to exist in lattice simulations @xcite of ym theory .",
    "we argue that incorporating quantum fluctuations of the string world - sheet may induce such a term as was also the case in ref .",
    "the potential energy of a quark anti - quark pair translates in the mqcd language to the area of the m - theory membrane that corresponds to the qcd string .",
    "therefore , the extraction of the potential energy involves the construction of the mqcd setup @xcite , introducing a convenient parameterization of the membrane , and computing its area .",
    "we begin by reviewing the mqcd setup of @xcite .      the mqcd description of @xmath0 sqcd is given in terms of a five - brane ( m5 ) embedded in @xmath13 , where the 11-th compact dimension @xmath14 is a circle of radius @xmath15 .",
    "the m5 has the form @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a riemann surface in the space @xmath18 which is a three dimensional complex space with coordinates @xmath19 where @xmath20  .",
    "the setup does not extend in the additional non compact dimension , and we can express this as the requirement @xmath21 .    in the limit",
    "@xmath22 the m5 reduces to the well known type iia brane configuration of figure ( [ fig : branes ] ) @xcite . in this configuration",
    "the flavor degrees of freedom are associated with the semi - infinite d4 branes stretched to the right of the ns5 brane .",
    "an alternative setup includes semi - infinite d4 branes stretched both to the right of the ns5 brane and to the left of the ns5 brane .",
    "this later configuration is considered in section 2.4 .",
    "although we have quarks in our setup they are very heavy and we take for @xmath17 the super yang ",
    "mills @xmath7 curve @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a complex constant .",
    "we measure distances in m - theory units , namely , in units where the planck length is set to be @xmath25 .",
    "we see that for each @xmath26 there are @xmath27 distinct @xmath28 points , differing by powers of the phase @xmath29 , and therefore there are @xmath27 branches of the m5 brane .",
    "the mqcd m5 is characterized by two dimensionful parameters , @xmath15 and @xmath24 , whereas the @xmath10 sym has only a single scale @xmath30 .",
    "matching the string and domain wall tensions of mqcd with the corresponding ones of the large @xmath27 sym requires the following assignments @xcite : latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\label{rofl } r      & \\sim & { 1 \\over { n \\lambda_{qcd } } } \\\\ \\label{zofl }    @xmath15 and @xmath24 upon @xmath30 is dictated from dimensional analysis . as we shall deal with the small @xmath27 regime , and are not interested in numerical factors in the @xmath30 language , the @xmath27 dependence of ( [ rofl]),([zofl ] ) will not be used by us .",
    "quarks and w  bosons are described in mqcd by membranes wrapped around the 11-th dimension .",
    "this leads to open strings of type iia in the limit @xmath22 .",
    "the boundaries of such membranes must be curves on @xmath17 with zero winding - number around the 11-th dimension @xcite .",
    "such membranes may have the topology of a disk or of a cylinder .",
    "it was shown @xcite that membranes with the cylinder topology correspond to vector supermultyplets , while those with the disk topology correspond to chiral ones . in @xcite it was demonstrated that in our setup we can not describe a membrane representing a single quark , hence quarks are confined .",
    "the construction we are interested in is of a `` meson '' , that is , of a quark and an anti  quark connected by a qcd string .",
    "the membrane corresponding to the qcd string is stretching in one direction along @xmath32 , while in the other direction it interpolates between two adjacent branches of the m5 brane ( see figure ( [ fig : string ] ) ) .",
    "this membrane will not vary in the @xmath33 direction , so we might take @xmath34 , and have @xmath35 .",
    "the length of the interpolating segment for a certain @xmath36 , which is the width of the membrane , is ( as we will see shortly ) @xcite @xmath37 ( from here on @xmath24 stands for @xmath38 ) .",
    "the membrane corresponding to a fundamental type iia string ( `` quark '' ) transforms _ smoothly _ into a qcd string and back into a fundamental string .",
    "the membrane s area is the total energy of the `` meson '' in m - theory units .",
    "this area tends to infinity as the quarks masses approach infinity , so we need to subtract those masses .",
    "we consider only the part of the membrane that behaves as a qcd string membrane rather than quark membrane ( fundamental string in the type iia string theory ) .",
    "we first characterize the point of the transition  this is the point where the tension of the qcd string is the same as the type iia string tension : @xmath39    once we make all our calculations up to this value of @xmath36 , the quarks , whose masses we wish to subtract , are simply qcd strings with constant coordinates in @xmath32 and @xmath36 , going from the maximal value we found ( which we will eventually take to infinity ) to zero .",
    "the qcd string is associated with an m2 stretched in the @xmath18 space , as well as in one spatial dimension of @xmath32 , that we take as @xmath40 . for each @xmath41 ,",
    "the membrane s slice is a straight line segment in @xmath28 with both ends on @xmath17 .",
    "we have the freedom to rotate the @xmath42 plane so that this segment will vary only in @xmath43 , and likewise for @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , we can write a parameterization of the membrane as , so it corresponds to @xmath46 .",
    "this , however , has no physical significance , and we shall continue to treat @xmath36 and @xmath47 interchangeably . ]",
    "@xmath48 with @xmath49 . for @xmath50",
    ", @xmath51 is on @xmath17 and the distance between these two points gives the string s width ( [ width ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath52 is determined by minimizing the area of the membrane .",
    "the width ( in the @xmath28 space ) of the qcd string decreases as @xmath36 approaches @xmath53 , so the membrane has an `` incentive '' to achieve small values of @xmath36 . on the other hand , of course",
    ", this involves a large detour in @xmath36 .",
    "the best compromise is achieved , as we shall see , for a minimal value of @xmath36 , being @xmath54 , exponentially small in @xmath4 .",
    "taking the membrane s area as an action , we can write a lagrangian which is an area element in the form @xmath55}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 , and @xmath57 and @xmath58 correspond to @xmath59 and @xmath60 . inserting the explicit expression of ( [ memparam ] )",
    "one finds @xmath61 where @xmath62    integrating over @xmath63 we get : @xmath64    we look at the limit @xmath65 ( in m - theory units .",
    "the dimensionful condition is @xmath66 . ] ) , so by ( [ rofl],[zofl ] ) , for not too big an @xmath27 , @xmath67    and therefore : @xmath68    which has a very simple form for @xmath69 : @xmath70    this form has a simple interpretation .",
    "it corresponds to the area ignoring the change in the @xmath28 coordinates of @xmath71 , as a function of @xmath60 , and retaining only its @xmath41 change .",
    "@xmath72 is then the length of the line element of the qcd string in the @xmath41 plane , and @xmath73 is the width of the membrane in the transverse @xmath28 plane .",
    "this width , then , provides naturally the metric , which is scalar diagonal .",
    "however , although the change in @xmath74 and @xmath75 is suppressed by the factor ( [ lambdalimit ] ) , we can not ignore it if it tends to infinity with @xmath36 .",
    "the only case in which we can ignore this change is when @xmath76 , that is , the case @xmath77 . hence , this interpretation is valid only for @xmath78 , where , indeed , @xmath76 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the @xmath77 action is @xmath79    we shall first treat the case in which the quark and the anti  quark are on the same ns5 brane ( in the iia picture ) , that is , they both reside in the @xmath80 limit . due to the symmetry of the problem we have @xmath81 , and defining @xmath82 we can write ( as the lagrangian does not depend explicitly on @xmath83 ) : @xmath84    this differential equation can be written as : @xmath85    which gives : @xmath86    in particular , since by ( [ sametension],[lambdalimit ] ) we have @xmath87 , we can write : @xmath88    inserting the solution we found into the action , we see that the energy of the qcd string is : @xmath89    from which we must subtract the ( infinite ) mass of the quark : @xmath90    changing the integration variable to @xmath91 and @xmath92 , and defining @xmath93 , we finally get : @xmath94    where @xmath95      the distance @xmath4 as a function of @xmath96 is shown in the appendix to take the following form @xmath97 the explicit dependence of the energy @xmath98 on @xmath96 , which is also computed in the appendix , reads @xmath99 with @xmath100 .    inserting the value of @xmath96 from the inverse of ( [ lofe2 ] ) , we finally find the following expression for @xmath98 as a function of @xmath4 @xmath101    it is easy to see how the corrections to the linear potential depend on @xmath30 , the parameter of @xmath10 sym theory , by translating the mqcd parameters according to ( [ rofl],[zofl ] ) . as a function of @xmath4 ,",
    "one correction is constant , while the other is essentially exponential in @xmath102 .",
    "in fact , given the dependence on @xmath4 , the dependence on @xmath30 is determined , since @xmath30 is the only energy scale of the original theory .",
    "note that the potential does not include a lscher term , namely , a term of the form @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is a positive universal constant .",
    "such a term is missing also in the wilson line derived from the ads / cft correspondence @xcite . since the traces of such a term were observed in lattice simulations @xcite ( and in phenomenological fits to the heavy mesons spectra ) , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite suggested that this may indicate that there is a phase transition .",
    "the proposed scenario is that the lscher term exists in the weak coupling phase but is missing in the strong coupling phase .",
    "it seems to us that the origin of the discrepancy is different and , in fact , is hidden in the work that led to the discovery of the @xmath105 term @xcite .",
    "the source of this term is the contribution of the gaussian fluctuations around the classical solution . in the present work , as well as in those that follow the ads",
    "/ cft duality , the computation was based solely on the classical solution and the quantum fluctuations have not been incorporated . it is plausible that the evaluation of the fluctuations around the classical configuration in the stringy calculations of both mqcd and the ads / cft duality will produce a term of the form @xmath105 .",
    "we proceed now to discuss the case in which the quark and the anti  quark are , asymptotically , at @xmath106 . in the iia picture , they are on the two ns5 branes , as opposed to the setup discussed so far , in which they are on the same ns5 brane .",
    "the previous case gave rise to an even function @xmath107 , whereas now we get an odd function .",
    "we expect the energy for this case to be higher than the previous one .",
    "the reason is that if we reflect , for negative @xmath60 , the graph of the odd @xmath107 , we get an even membrane with the same area .",
    "the solution found in the previous sections for the even case has , of course , a smaller area .",
    "( the reflected membrane would not be in equilibrium for @xmath108 ) .",
    "the lagrangian and hamiltonian are equal to those of the previous case , but , as @xmath109 , the solution is now specified by the value of @xmath110 , and @xmath111    if we define for this case @xmath112 and substitute @xmath113 , we get @xmath114 and the energy , after subtracting the quark mass , is @xmath115    using methods similar to those used in the even case , we get for the energy a stronger dependence on @xmath96 .",
    "this time we have @xmath116    we can , therefore , write @xmath4 only to the first order in @xmath96 .",
    "this happens to be identical to the even case , so we have for @xmath96 @xmath117    inserting this into the expression of the energy , we have for this case : @xmath118    this potential has the same type of behavior as the one with the asymmetric mqcd setup .",
    "the corrections to the string tension term are a constant and an exponential term .",
    "however , it is clear that for small enough @xmath96 ( that is , large enough @xmath4 ) this result is larger than the one we got for the even @xmath107 case .",
    "we proceed now to analyze the @xmath12 potential in a mqcd setup that corresponds to softly broken @xmath119 sym . in the field theory picture",
    "this is achieved by giving mass to the gaugino and in the context of brane configurations this is done by rotating one of the ns branes in a non - holomorphic way ( e.g. rotation in the @xmath120 plane ) .",
    "the notations that we are using are those of @xcite where the brane is parameterized by two four dimensional complex null vectors @xmath121 and @xmath122 , @xmath123 in the following form @xmath124    where @xmath125 is a complex number and @xmath104 is a real number given by @xmath126 in this notation we choose the @xmath10 curve to be @xmath127    using the rotation suggested in @xcite we keep @xmath121 the same as for @xmath10 and choose @xmath128    for simplicity , we shall concentrate now on @xmath69 ym , namely , considering the brane at a constant @xmath129 ( that is , @xmath130 ) we find the cross - section with the @xmath42 plane to be a circle of radius @xmath131 , and the cross section with the @xmath44 plane a circle of radius @xmath132 .",
    "the distance between two points of equal @xmath33 is therefore @xmath133    using the arguments given above for the supersymmetric @xmath69 theory we can write the lagrangian of this theory , defining @xmath134 , as @xmath135    and the expressions for the length and the energy of the qcd string @xmath136    where @xmath137    and we used ( according to ( [ lambdalimit ] ) ) : @xmath138    using the same methods as in the supersymmetric case we find @xmath139 and for @xmath140 @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the zeroth order term of @xmath143 .",
    "we finally have for the energy in the softly broken sym theory @xmath144 using the relation of the rotation parameter @xmath57 to the gaugino mass given in @xcite we get in our notations the plausible result @xmath145 , and the pure ym theory is given by @xmath146 and @xmath147 . in this case",
    "the energy takes the form @xmath148 comparing this result to the one of the @xmath10 case we see that it has the same principal functional dependence on @xmath4 .",
    "the string tension is modified , however , and so is the exponential correction , since the screening length is @xmath15 rather than @xmath149 as in the supersymmetric case .",
    "as the equations ( [ rofl],[zofl ] ) give the relation between @xmath150 and @xmath30 only upto dimensionless constants , the significance of those modifications in field theory is unclear .",
    "an interesting special case of this calculation is when @xmath151 , when the curve spans only the @xmath47 and @xmath42 coordinates and is singular at @xmath152 ( or @xmath153 ) , where the corresponding qcd string s width is zero .",
    "the behavior we find for this case is very similar to the one described in @xcite ( @xmath154 at finite temperature ) .",
    "once we regulate the integrals ( by taking the upper limit as @xmath155 instead of @xmath156 ) we find that for @xmath157 the quarks are free ( the favorite configuration is of two  bare ",
    "quarks with the qcd string located at @xmath47=0 ) while for @xmath158 we still have linear confinement as the leading order behavior .",
    "quark anti - quark potentials have been extracted recently from computations of wilson loops in various supergravity models which are conjectured duals of supersymmetric gauge theories in the large @xmath27 limit @xcite@xcite .",
    "it is thus interesting to compare the calculations in the mqcd framework to those of the gauge / gravity dual models . in both cases , in spite of the fact that the starting points seem very different , the calculations reduce eventually to computing the area of a bosonic string world - sheet via a nambu  goto action .",
    "moreover , using a gauge @xmath159 where @xmath160 is a world - sheet coordinate and @xmath60 is a coordinate along which the quark anti - quark pair is situated , the mqcd and gravity calculations are special cases of an integral of the following form @xcite @xmath161 where @xmath36 is a coordinate external to the @xmath162 space - time , @xmath163 in the mqcd case and the fifth coordinate of the @xmath164 space ( or of its relatives ) .",
    "in fact , in the approach of polyakov @xcite , @xmath36 is associated with the liouville coordinate .",
    "it is straightforward to realize that @xmath165 are both @xmath166 in @xmath69 mqcd , @xmath167 in the ads / cft case @xcite , @xmath168 in finite temperature @xcite and @xmath169 for the `` pure ym '' 4 dimensional model @xcite .",
    "naturally we would like to compare the quark potentials extracted from the stringy computations .",
    "in particular the mqcd result for broken supersymmetry ( [ enons ] ) can be compared with the precise computation of pure ym theory in four dimensions ( eqn .",
    "( 22 ) of @xcite ) . in both cases",
    "the corrections to the linear potential do not include a @xmath105 lscher term , but only an exponential term of the form @xmath170 , where @xmath171 is proportional to @xmath30 .",
    "we believe that a @xmath105 term will show up once quantum fluctuations are incorporated as was the case in @xcite unlike the mqcd result , there is no constant term in the expression derived from the supergravity setup @xcite , but this may follow from a different subtraction .    in this work on precision ",
    "measurements \" of the quark potential from mqcd , we found two types of corrections to the linear potential between external ( very heavy ) quark and anti  quark in @xmath69 , @xmath10 , sym .",
    "the first is a constant correction proportional to @xmath15 ( the radius of the 11-th dimension ) and the second is essentially exponential in @xmath172 .",
    "we considered two configurations ",
    "one with both quarks on the same ns5 brane , and the other with the quarks on the two opposite ns5 branes .",
    "although these configurations are supposed to describe the same field theory , we found the corrections are different .",
    "we looked at theories where supersymmetry is softly broken and found that the behavior is qualitatively the same - a linear potential with a constant and exponential corrections . for more general @xmath7 ( s)ym one can write analogous equations to ( [ lofe],[eofe ] ) .",
    "however , as is clear from ( [ lofe ] ) , for @xmath173 the expressions will be much more cumbersome .",
    "we are happy to thank ofer aharony , oded kenneth and shimon yankielowicz for very valuable discussions .",
    "this behavior can be calculated in a few steps .",
    "first we look at an integral with the same divergence for @xmath178 as @xmath179 , for which we can find a primitive function and therefore evaluate its value as a series in @xmath96 : @xmath180    all that remains is to evaluate the contribution of the difference @xmath181 .",
    "as both integrals have the same divergence for @xmath182 the difference is continuous for @xmath183 and its leading contribution is given by setting @xmath183 : @xmath184        ( as before , checking that the difference of the integrals does not diverge when we set @xmath183 provides a proof that we found the correct diverging term ) . integrating the result we got with respect to @xmath96",
    ", we find that the difference s contribution is @xmath188 , and show that @xmath179 is as in ( [ i1 ] ) . inserting this expression in ( [ lofe ] ) @xmath189 we finally find ( [ lofe3 ] ) . all that is left is to invert this expression , namely @xmath190                    the behavior of @xmath206 and @xmath207 can be found in a similar way to the one we used to find @xmath4 :",
