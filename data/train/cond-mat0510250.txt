    "with the advent of high temperature superconductivity in the cuprates and the possibility of exotic gap symmetry including nodal behavior , a renewed effort to find novel experimental probes of order parameter symmetry has ensued .",
    "one result of this effort was the proposal by sauls and co - workers@xcite to examine the nonlinear current response of d - wave superconductors .",
    "they showed that a nonanalyticity in the current - velocity relation at temperature @xmath1 is introduced by the presence of nodes in the order parameter .",
    "one prediction was that an anisotropy should exist in the nonlinear current as a function of the direction of the superfluid velocity relative to the position of the node .",
    "this would be reflected in an anisotropy of a term in the inverse penetration depth which is linear in the magnetic field @xmath2 .",
    "early experimental work did not verify these predictions@xcite and it was suggested that impurity scattering@xcite or nonlocal effects@xcite may be responsible .",
    "however , a more recent reanalysis of experiment has claimed to confirm the predictions@xcite .",
    "an alternative proposal was given by dahm and scalapino@xcite who examined the quadratic term in the magnetic response of the penetration depth , which shows a @xmath3 dependence at low @xmath4 as first discussed by xu et al.@xcite .",
    "dahm and scalapino demonstrated that this upturn would provide a clear and unique signature of the nodes in the d - wave gap and that this feature could be measured directly via microwave intermodulation effects .",
    "indeed , experimental verification of this has been obtained@xcite confirming that nonlinear microwave current response can be used as a sensitive probe of issues associated with the order parameter symmetry .",
    "thus , we are led to consider further cases of gap anisotropy and turn our attention to the two - band superconductor mgb@xmath0 which is already under scrutiny for possible applications , including passive microwave filter technology@xcite .",
    "mgb@xmath0 was discovered in 2001@xcite and since this time an enormous scientific effort has focused on this material . on the basis of the evidence that is available , it is now thought that this material may be our best candidate for a classic two - band electron - phonon superconductor , with s - wave pairing in each channel@xcite .",
    "a heightened interest in two - band superconductivity has led to claims of possible two - band effects in many other materials , both old@xcite and new@xcite .",
    "our goal is to compare in detail the differences between one - band and two - band s - wave superconductors in terms of their nonlinear response , that would be measured in the coefficients defined by xu et al.@xcite and dahm and scalapino@xcite .",
    "this leads us to reconsider the one - band s - wave case , where we study issues of dimensionality , impurities , and strong electron - phonon coupling .",
    "we find new effects due to strong - coupling at both high and low @xmath4 .",
    "we then examine the situation for two - band superconductors , starting from a case of highly decoupled bands . here",
    ", we are looking for signatures of the low energy scale due to the smaller gap , the effect of integration of the bands , and the response to inter- and intraband impurities .",
    "unusual behavior exists distinctly different from the one - band case and not necessarily understood as a superposition of two separate superconductors . finally , we return to the case of mgb@xmath0 which was studied previously via a more approximate approach@xcite . in the current work ,",
    "we are able to use the complete microscopic theory with the parameters and the electron - phonon spectral functions taken from band structure@xcite . in this way",
    ", we provide more detailed predictions for the nonlinear coefficient of mgb@xmath0 .    in section  ii , we briefly summarize the necessary theory for calculating the gap and renormalization function in two - band superconductors , from which the current as a function of the superfluid velocity @xmath5 is then derived . in section  iii",
    ", we explain our procedure for extracting the temperature - dependent nonlinear term from the current and we examine the characteristic features for one - band superconductors in light of issues of dimensionality , impurity scattering and strong coupling .",
    "section  iv presents the results of two - band superconductors and simple formulas are given for limiting cases which aid in illuminating the effects of anisotropy . the case of mgb@xmath0",
    "is also discussed .",
    "we form our conclusions in section  v.",
    "the superfluid current has been considered theoretically in the past by many authors for s - wave@xcite and for other order parameters , such as d - wave and f - wave@xcite .",
    "most recently , the case of two - band superconductivity has been examined@xcite with good agreement obtained between theory and experiment for the temperature dependence of the critical current@xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we wish to calculate the superfluid current as a function of superfluid velocity @xmath5 or momentum @xmath6 and extract from this the nonlinear term . to do this , we choose to evaluate the expression for the superfluid current density @xmath7 that is written on the imaginary axis in terms of matsubara quantities.@xcite this naturally allows for the inclusion of impurity scattering and strong electron - phonon coupling in a numerically efficient manner .",
    "written in general for two - bands having a current @xmath8 and @xmath9 , for the first and second band , respectively , we have : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the electric charge , @xmath12 is the electron mass , @xmath4 is the temperature , @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the electron density and @xmath15 is the fermi velocity of the @xmath16th band ( @xmath17,2 ) .",
    "the @xmath18 represents an integration for the @xmath16th band which is given as @xmath19 for a 3d band and @xmath20 for a 2d band , with @xmath21 in the 2d case .",
    "also , in the expression for the current , the 3 should be changed to a 2 for 2d .",
    "this is done within a mean - field treatment and ignoring critical fluctuations near @xmath22 . here",
    ", we have taken the approximation of a spherical fermi surface in 3d and a cylindrical one in 2d as we will see further on that the differences between 2d and 3d are not significant to more than a overall numerical factor and so providing more precise fermi surface averages will not changes the results in a meaningful way . to evaluate this expression , we require the solution of the standard s - wave eliashberg equations for the renormalized gaps and frequencies @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively . these have been generalized to two bands and must also include the effect of the current through @xmath6 . with further details given in refs .",

    "note that the dimensionality does not change the gap equations when there is no current . for finite @xmath6",
    ", it does and we will see later the result of this effect . likewise , an essential ingredient is that the current enters the eliashberg equations and provides the bulk of the nonlinear effect for temperatures above @xmath40 .",
    "indeed , at @xmath22 all of the nonlinearity arises from the gap .",
    "we now proceed to the case of one - band superconductors , to illustrate the generic features of the superfluid current and demonstrate how we extract the nonlinear term . in the section following , we will return to the two - band case .",
    "( 250,200 )    in fig .  [ fig1 ] , we illustrate that these equations reproduce the standard results for @xmath7 versus @xmath6 for a one - band superconductor in the weak coupling bcs limit . equations ( [ eq : js])-([eq : z ] ) were solved for both the 2d and 3d cases at @xmath41 and 0.95 .",
    "the @xmath1 result of past literature@xcite is recovered in the case of 3d .",
    "one sees for @xmath42 at low @xmath6 , the curve is essentially linear , reflecting the relationship of @xmath43 , with @xmath44 the superfluid density . for strong coupling , the slope would be reduced by approximately @xmath45 as the superfluid condensate is also reduced by this factor .",
    "likewise the reduction in the slope with temperature would reflect the temperature dependence of the superfluid density . indeed , to provide these curves using the eliashberg equations",
    ", we used the @xmath46 spectrum of al and made the corrections for the @xmath45 factor .",
    "al is a classic bcs weak coupling superconductor , that agrees with bcs in every way and is generally used for bcs tests of the eliashberg equations .",
    "the @xmath47 for al is 0.43 .",
    "while at low @xmath4 the curves show little deviation from linearity at low @xmath6 , and thus the nonlinear correction will be essentially zero ( exponentially so with temperature in bcs theory ) , at @xmath4 near @xmath22 , one sees that there is more curvature for @xmath48 and hence a larger nonlinear term is expected .",
    "however , while the 2d and 3d curves differ in behavior near the maximum in @xmath7 , one finds that the behavior at low @xmath6 is very similar .",
    "indeed , the nonlinearity is a very small effect on these plots and hard to discern , however , it will be borne out in our paper that the nonlinear current does not show significant differences in the @xmath4-dependence between 2d and 3d .",
    "nevertheless , we will still include both the 2d and 3d calculation in our two - band calculations as mgb@xmath0 has a 2d @xmath49-band and a 3d @xmath50-band , and there is a overall factor of 2/3 between the two in the nonlinear term due to dimensionality .    to obtain the nonlinear current as @xmath48 , the general expression for the current",

    "coupling one finds an increase in the nonlinear piece near @xmath22 and also a finite contribution at low @xmath4 which is unexpected in the usual bcs scenario .",
    "impurities have the effect of further increasing the low @xmath4 contribution and reducing the curve near @xmath22 .",

    "( 250,200 )    in fig .",

    ". first , the 2d bcs curve derived from our procedure agrees with that shown by xu et al.@xcite , once again validating our numerical work for extracting the very tiny nonlinear coefficient .",
    "second , for bcs one sees a difference between 2d and 3d in the nonlinear coefficient .",
    "the 2d curve goes to 1 at @xmath22 and to 2/3 for the 3d case .",
    "the question arises as to whether the difference between 2d and 3d is simply a numerical factor and so with the dotted curve , we show the 3d case scaled up by 3/2 .",
    "we do note that there is a small difference in the temperature variations at an intermediate range of @xmath4 , but the major difference between 2d and 3d is the overall numerical factor of 2/3 .",
    "third , one might question the necessity of including the effect of the current on the gap itself and to answer this , we show the long - dashed curve where the @xmath6 dependence was omitted in the eliashberg equations ( [ eq : del ] ) and ( [ eq : z ] ) .",
    "one finds that the nonlinear coefficient is reduced substantially at temperatures above @xmath76 and disappears at @xmath22 .",
    "thus , without the @xmath6 dependence in the gap , the true nonlinear effects will not be obtained for high temperatures as the gap provides the major contribution to the nonlinearity .    in the lower frame of fig .",

    "it is seen that the strong coupling increases the value at @xmath22 and also gives a finite value at low @xmath4 .",
    "the behavior at low @xmath4 is surprising in light of the bcs result@xcite , but is related to the inelastic electron - phonon scattering which appears to increase the nonlinear coefficient at small @xmath4 in a similar way to what is already known about the effect of impurities in bcs@xcite .",
    "the strong coupling behavior near @xmath22 is similar to that seen for other quantities such as the specific heat@xcite , where the downward bcs curvature is now turned concave upward to higher values at @xmath22 .",

    "one finds qualitatively similar curves .",
    "the 2d and 3d bcs curves go to zero rapidly at low temperature , but once again the strong coupling effects in pb give a finite value for @xmath68 at low @xmath4 . with impurities the tail at low temperature is raised significantly . due to the divergence in @xmath68 near @xmath22 because of the division by three powers of the superfluid density which is going to zero at @xmath22 , we prefer to work with a new quantity @xmath93 , which removes this divergence .",
    "thus , we define @xmath94 and this is shown in the inset in fig .",
    "it has the advantage of illustrating the detailed differences between the curves more clearly and providing finite values at @xmath22 which can be evaluated analytically in bcs theory . in this instance , we obtain @xmath95 for three dimensions in agreement with what we obtain from our numerical work , shown in the fig .

    "this last quantity @xmath99 is related to the intermodulation power in microstrip resonators and hence can be measured directly .",

    "another interesting limiting case is to assume both bands are the same , i.e. isotropic gap case , but that the fermi velocities differ in the two bands .",
    "near @xmath22 , we obtain @xmath168 ^ 3 } \\frac{1}{8}\\frac{(v_{f1}+v_{f2})^2}{(v_{f1}v_{f2})^2}(v_{f1}^2+v_{f2}^2).\\ ] ] in this case , the fermi velocity anisotropy changes the nonlinear coefficient , but when @xmath118 the expression reduces properly to the one - band result .",
    "we find that the fermi velocity anisotropy increases @xmath68 near @xmath22 , a result that is seen in one of our calculations for mgb@xmath0 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .",
    "( 250,200 )    with fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we now turn to the specific case of mgb@xmath0 , where we have used the parameters and @xmath112 given by band structure calculations , and as a result , there are , in principle , no free parameters other than varying the impurity scattering rate .",
    "the basic parameters are @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath176 , with a @xmath177  k and a gap anisotropy of @xmath178 .",
    "the ratio of the two density of states is @xmath179 and of the fermi velocities is @xmath180 .",
    "we have found excellent agreement between theory and experiment for these parameters , as have other authors@xcite . as we have found in our previous work , mgb@xmath0 is quite integrated between the bands .",
    "it is also an intermediate strong coupler with @xmath181 and thus there is competition between the strong coupling effects and the anisotropy@xcite . in fig .  6",
    ", the solid curve gives the prediction for mgb@xmath0 for @xmath60 and @xmath68 .",
    "a strong nonmonotonic feature around the lower band energy scale is observed in @xmath60 , but the @xmath68 is monotonically increasing with temperature . to see the second band effects in @xmath68 ,",
    "it is better to plot @xmath182 ( the inset ) which accentuates the subtle variations found at the lower energy scale associated with the @xmath50 band .",
    "also shown in the inset for the upper frame is @xmath59 , which gives the temperature dependence of the superfluid density .",
    "the solid curve agrees with our previous calculation by other means@xcite .",
    "the variation in @xmath59 appears to be sufficient to remove the bump in @xmath60 when divided by three factors of @xmath59 to obtain the definition of @xmath68 . also , shown are the effects of intraband scattering with @xmath183 for the dashed curve and @xmath184 for the dot - dashed .",
    "scattering in the @xmath50-band reduces its contribution and provides an impurity tail at low @xmath4 , as found for the one - band case .",
    "however , scattering in the @xmath49-band , while lowering @xmath60 near @xmath22 as expected , does not appear to add weight at low @xmath4 .",
    "this is because the parameters for mgb@xmath0 heavily weight the @xmath50-band and the @xmath49-band is a small component .",
    "thus , upon comparison between @xmath49- and @xmath50-band scattering , @xmath68 could be lowered at @xmath185 , for example , by putting impurities in the @xmath50-band , but it would be raised if the impurity scattering is in the @xmath49-band .",
    "the dotted curve in the figure is for pure mgb@xmath0 but where we have taken @xmath186 to mimic a case where transport may happen along the c - axis . in this instance , the bump in @xmath60 remains , but is gone in @xmath68 .",
    "we see that @xmath68 is large due to the higher power of the fermi velocity ratio that enters the calculation , and , as a result , the nonlinearity is greatly increased .",
    "as @xmath68 is a relevant quantity for microwave filter design , this study provides some insight into which factors may be used to optimize the material and reduce the nonlinear effects .",
    "study of nonlinear current response is important for device applications and for providing fundamental signatures of order parameter symmetry , such as have been examined in the case of d - wave superconductivity . in this paper , we have considered the case of two - band superconductors . in so doing , we also reexamined the one - band case and discovered that there can exist extra nonlinearity at both low and high temperatures due to strong electron - phonon coupling , for which we have provided strong - coupling correction formulas , whereas the excess nonlinearity induced by impurity scattering occurs primarily at low temperatures . at @xmath22",
    ", impurities will give an enhanced or decreased contribution depending on the particular nonlinear coefficient discussed .",
    "in this paper , we have examined two nonlinear coefficients defined in the literature , one due to xu et al.@xcite and one defined by dahm and scalapino , with an emphasis on the latter as it is related to the intermodulation power in microstrip resonators@xcite .",
    "we have also studied issues associated with dimensionality motivated by the two - band superconductor mgb@xmath0 , which has a two - dimensional @xmath49-band and a three - dimensional @xmath50-band . within our one - band calculation , aside from an overall factor of 2/3 , we find little difference in the temperature variation of the nonlinear coefficient in mean - field between 2d and 3d .",
    "this is further reduced by strong coupling effects .    for two - band superconductors ,",
    "we show that for nearly decoupled bands a strong signature of the small gap @xmath50-band will appear in the nonlinear coefficients , but with increased interband coupling or interband scattering , such a signature will rapidly disappear . likewise",
    ", intraband impurities in the @xmath50-band will wash out the temperature variation of the @xmath50-band , whereas the intraband impurities in the @xmath49-band largely effect the nonlinearity at higher temperatures above the energy scale of the @xmath50-band , for the parameters typical to mgb@xmath0 .",
    "we provide a prediction for the nonlinear coefficient in mgb@xmath0 using the parameters set by band structure calculations . as the bands in mgb@xmath0 are quite integrated , we find that the nonlinear coefficient @xmath68 is monotonically increasing in contrast to a previous prediction , which was based on a number of approximations,@xcite and we find that the increased nonlinearity due to the @xmath50-band is best reduced at @xmath185 by adding impurities to the @xmath50-band .",
    "should the supercurrent sample the c - axis direction , a larger anisotropy in the fermi velocity ratio between the bands would result and this effect is found to increase the nonlinearity .",
    "finally , several simple formulas have been provided for near @xmath22 which aid in the understanding of the range of behavior observed in the numerical calculations .",
    "we await experimental verification of our predictions .",
