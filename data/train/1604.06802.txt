    "the physical conditions of the interstellar medium ( ism ) provide clues to understanding the current state and past activity of star formation and gas reprocessing in galaxies .",
    "the study of ionized gas in star - forming ( i.e. , hii ) regions has been carried out through many early observational efforts ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the underlying physics has been developed theoretically with photoionization models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "numerous efforts to study the ism in low - redshift galaxies ( @xmath8 ) are based on large spectroscopic data sets such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a wide variety of empirical diagnostics of the gas properties have been established , especially based on spectral features in the rest - frame optical window .",
    "in particular , the baldwin  phillips ",
    "terlevich ( bpt ; @xcite ) diagnostic diagram compares line ratios [ nii]/h@xmath1 and [ oiii]/h@xmath9 to distinguish star - forming galaxies from those hosting and/or dominated by an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "local star - forming galaxies form a tight ` abundance sequence ' in the bpt diagram ( e.g. , @xcite ) with ionization attributed to radiation from young massive stars ( type o and b ) .",
    "in contrast , agns deviate from this sequence due to harder radiation from an accretion disk",
    ". large data sets such as sdss have established a precise location of star - forming galaxies and agns thus facilitating a relatively clean selection of these populations",
    ".    however , the ism properties of galaxies at higher redshifts ( @xmath10 ) , where most key rest - frame optical emission lines are redshifted into infrared , are still unclear .",
    "one would expect the properties of ionized gas in high-@xmath0 galaxies to be dissimilar to local galaxies given their higher star formation rate ( sfr ) and higher gas fraction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "over the last decade , the universality of the bpt diagram for high - redshift galaxies has been examined through near - infrared spectroscopic campaigns .",
    "early studies have reported an offset of the distribution of star - forming galaxies at higher redshifts ( @xmath113 ) from the local abundance sequence based on relatively small samples ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "more recent , the offset has been reaffirmed using larger samples ( e.g. , @xcite ) observed with multi - object near - infrared spectrographs .",
    "however , the amount of the offset in the bpt diagram and other emission - line diagrams has not been firmly established across the general star - forming population at the various epochs since the location of galaxies on such diagrams can be significantly affected by sample selection ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these offsets likely reflect more extreme conditions of hii gas in high-@xmath0 galaxies such as having a higher value of the ionization parameter ( @xmath12 ) , i.e. , the ratio of ionizing photon number density to the hydrogen atom density of hii regions , or a harder radiation field inferred by the presence of metal - poor , fe - depleted stars and/or massive binaries @xcite .",
    "alternative explanations are an enhancement of the nitrogen - to - oxygen abundance and high gas pressure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , it still remains unsettled what physical factors cause the bpt offset and other changes in the emission - line ratios of high-@xmath0 galaxies .",
    "directly related to diagnostics of ionization , the gas - phase metallicity ( hereafter metallicity ) is one of the important probe of the galaxy evolution as a tool to trace past star formation history .",
    "the abundance of an element from nucleosynthesis is further influenced by both inflowing gas that dilutes the metal fraction of the ism , and outflows that transpose metals into the circumgalactic environment ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the local universe ,",
    "a correlation between stellar mass and metallicity has been robustly established based on large data sets such as sdss ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of a mass  metallicity ( mz ) relation has been extended up to @xmath13 or more ( e.g. , ) with an evolution where the metallicity decreases with redshift at a fixed stellar mass . we have previously reported a mz relation at @xmath14 @xcite , using a smaller subset of the data from the fmos - cosmos program @xcite , that shows the most massive galaxies as being fully mature at a level similar to local massive galaxies while lower mass galaxies are less enriched as compared to local galaxies . however there still remain some discrepancies between various studies that implement different sample selection methods and/or metallicity determinations .",
    "an anti - correlation between metallicity and sfr at a fixed stellar mass has been seen in local galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , @xcite introduced the sfr as a third parameter in the mz relation , and proposed the existence of a universal relation between these three quantities , referred to as the _ fundamental metallicity relation _ ( fmr ) .",
    "several studies have found that introducing the fmr reduces the scatter relative to the mz relation , although the actual shape of the fmr may differ appreciably from one study to another due to differences in sample selection and/or in the adopted metallicity indicator ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the apparent sfr@xmath15 anti - correlation is interpreted as resulting from upward fluctuations of the infall rate of pristine / metal - poor gas boosting the sfr while diluting the metallicity of the ism @xcite , as supported by several analytic studies and numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "measuring the @xmath16-@xmath15-sfr relation at all redshifts is an essential step towards our understanding of star formation and the chemical evolution of galaxies .",
    "however , beyond the local universe , the existence and shape of the fmr has not been firmly established yet ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .    to further understand the typical characteristics of high-@xmath0 hii regions , it is highly desirable to construct a well - controlled sample of typical star - forming galaxies at each epoch . with the availability of multi - object near - infrared spectrographs ( i.e. , mosfire , fmos , kmos ) on large telescopes",

    ", we use a sample of h@xmath1-detected galaxies that trace the star - forming main sequence over a stellar mass range @xmath2 , from the fmos - cosmos survey @xcite to study the typical properties of hii regions of galaxies at @xmath21 .",
    "the unique advantages of our sample are the large size with 701 galaxies having an h@xmath1 detection , which is four times larger than that used in our previous study @xcite , and the high sampling rate of the massive galaxy population ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "in addition , our target selection is primarily based on the @xmath22 band photometry , which is a good proxy of stellar mass , thus tends to avoid significant selection biases , as compared to other samples at similar redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we also highlight that our fmos observations are much deeper ( 35 hours integration times ) than in @xcite and we have @xmath23-band spectra for about half of our sample that cover [ oiii ] and h@xmath9 .",

    "all data are reduced using the fmos pipeline fibre - pac ( fmos image - based reduction package ; @xcite ) .      in this paper , we utilize a larger catalog of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts from the fmos - cosmos survey than presented in @xcite and @xcite . this larger sample is the result of additional fmos observations carried out between dec 2013 and feb 2014 that are not reported in @xcite",

    "the majority of our sample is selected to have a stellar mass above @xmath43 and a photometric redshift @xmath44 .",
    "these values are derived for each object by fitting the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) using le phare @xcite with population synthesis models @xcite and a @xcite imf .",
    "hereafter , we convert all stellar masses to a salpeter imf by applying a multiplicative factor of 1.7 @xcite .    to achieve a high success rate of detecting the h@xmath33 emission line , we calculate the expected h@xmath33 flux for each galaxy in the photometric catalog and use these values in our target selection .",
    "the prediction of h@xmath1 flux represents a total flux from each galaxy ( without considering flux loss due to the fiber aperture ) calculated with equation 2 of from sfr , which is derived from the sed fitting assuming a constant star formation history ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "dust extinction towards the h@xmath1 emission line is derived via @xmath45 where the color excess @xmath46 is estimated from the sed and a @xcite extinction curve is assumed .",
    "we note that large uncertainties remain in the conversion between the amount of extinction towards stellar emission and that towards nebular emission , which is likely to depend on the geometrical properties of stars , dust , and star - forming regions .",
    "while @xmath47 is canonically applied locally @xcite , some studies report on higher values between 0.44 and 1 for high-@xmath0 galaxies based on measurements of the balmer decrement ( e.g. , h@xmath1/h@xmath9 ) or comparisons between sed- ( or uv- ) based sfrs and h@xmath1-sfrs . here , we use @xmath48 to calculate predicted h@xmath1 fluxes for target galaxies . in early pilot observations , a predicted h@xmath1 flux threshold of @xmath49 is set without taking into account the @xmath50 aperture loss . in the subsequent intensive program ,",

    "our measurements at low masses require a rapid decline of metallicity at higher sfrs ( see figure [ fig : fmr_lilly13]_ab _ ) .",
    "this trend is naturally induced by considering the evolution of galaxies as regulated by the gas content with the consideration of gas inflow and mass loss in the model of @xcite .",
    "our finding is consistent with the conclusion in @xcite , claiming that whether a fmr is truly fundamental ( i.e. , independent of redshift ) depends on the formulation of the model and its extrapolation to regions of the @xmath16sfr parameter space different from that occupied by local galaxies .",
    "lastly , we note that , in this study , we do not take into account for the time evolution of model parameters .",
    "we investigate the physical conditions of the ionized gas in star - forming galaxies on the main sequence at @xmath26 using a sample of 701 galaxies with an h@xmath1 detection from the fmos - cosmos survey .",
    "this is the first time using such a large sample over a wide stellar mass range of @xmath401 at these redshifts .",
    "based on the x - ray imaging data set from the _ chandra_-cosmos legacy survey , we carefully exclude the agn contamination and make sure that ionization due to agn does not impact our stacked measurements of the emission - line ratios .",
    "our main results are as follows :    1 .",
    "we confirm a clear offset of star - forming galaxies at @xmath14 from the sequence of local star - forming galaxies in the bpt diagram using both individual and stacked measurements ( figures [ fig : bpt ] and [ fig : bptst ] ) .",
    "this offset amounts to an increase in the [ oiii]/h@xmath9 ratio by a factor of @xmath402 in the mass  excitation diagram ( @xmath16 vs. [ oiii]/h@xmath9 ; figure [ fig : mex ] ) between our fmos sample and local sdss galaxies . 2 .   we measure the emission - line ratio [ sii]@xmath546717 , 6731/h@xmath1 with co - added spectra and find lower values of [ sii]/h@xmath1 for the highest two mass bins ( @xmath403 ) as compared with local star - forming galaxies at fixed [ oiii]/h@xmath9 ( figure [ fig : bpt_s2 ] ) .",
    "these lower [ sii]/h@xmath1 ratios are an indication of a higher ionization parameter of the ism as compared to of local galaxies .",
    "the average electron density is measured based on the emission - line ratio @xmath404}\\lambda6717/ \\text{[s\\sc ii]}\\lambda 6731 $ ] using stacked spectra that gives a value of @xmath210 , which is higher than the average value of local star - forming galaxies ( @xmath405 ; figure [ fig : sii ] ) .",
    "comparisons with theoretical models indicate a relatively high ionization parameter ( @xmath261 ) for hii regions in galaxies at @xmath14 , which is approximately 0.3  dex higher as compared to local star - forming galaxies at a fixed stellar mass ( figure [ fig : d16fig2 ] ) . given our measure of a relatively high gas density , a higher ionization parameter could reflect an increase in the efficiency of star formation expected for high-@xmath0 galaxies .",
    "we find that the enhancement in the ionization parameter _ at fixed metallicity _ , i.e. , a higher @xmath12 than expected from the local @xmath12@xmath15 anti - correlation , is essential to produce the offset of high-@xmath0 galaxies with @xmath406 from the loci of local galaxies in the emission - line diagrams",
    ". furthermore , additional effects , attributed to a higher electron density and a hardening of ionizing radiation field , are likely important as well ( figure [ fig : model ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the changes in emission - line ratios in lower - mass , @xmath14 galaxies ( @xmath407 ) could be explained by only the increase in @xmath12 accompanying the change in metallicity without invoking additional effects .",
    "we derive the mass  metallicity relation from the [ nii]/h@xmath1 ratio for our @xmath14 sample ( figure [ fig : mz ] ) .",
    "our results are consistent with the previous derivation for an sbzk - selected subsample in the fmos - cosmos survey @xcite .",
    "the current data strengthens our previous result : the most massive galaxies ( @xmath408 ) are fully mature at a level similar to local galaxies , while , at the lowest masses ( @xmath409 ) , the metallicity is on average @xmath410  dex smaller than local galaxies .",
    "our sample at @xmath14 is in good agreement with a universal metallicity relation proposed by @xcite , which is founded on the fundamental relation between metallicity and stellar - to - gas mass ratio .",
    "however , we highlight that the recipes for determining metallicity at high redshift may need further refinement due to changes in ionization parameter , hardness of stellar spectra , and in the n / o vs. o / h relation ( if any ) . 7 .",
    "we evaluate metallicity adopting a new calibration by , which uses the line ratios [ nii]/[sii ] and [ nii]/h@xmath1 ( figure [ fig : dopita16 ] ) and assumes universality of the local n / o vs. o / h relation .",
    "the novelty of this indicator is that it is less sensitive to changes in the ionization parameter .",
    "the derived mass  metallicity relation shows a trend that is qualitatively equivalent to that seen in the relation based on the [ nii]/h@xmath1 ratio , while the absolute value of the metallicity is slightly different .",
    "in addition , the mz relations based on this new indicator show an offset , between the sdss and fmos samples , three times as large as the scatter of the local mz relation at @xmath411 , while the [ nii]/h@xmath1-based mz relations show an offset five times the local scatter .",
    "this difference between the two metallicity indicators may be caused by the fact that the indicator is relatively insensitive to variations of the ionization parameter .",
    "the evolution of the mz relation since @xmath14 to the present - day is well characterized by the change of the turnover stellar mass at which the metallicity begins to saturate . as a consequence ,",
    "the mz relations at both epochs are described by a universal relation between metallicity and the stellar mass normalized by the turnover mass , which is a proxy of the stellar - to - gas mass ratio in the context of a simple chemical evolution model ( figure [ fig : unimz ] ) .",
    "we revise the fmr proposed by @xcite by using the total sfrs instead of in - fiber sfrs ( as done in @xcite ) and find that our fmos sample shows lower metallicities than expected for their @xmath16 and sfr from the extrapolation of the fmr ( figure [ fig : fmr ] ) .",
    "in contrast , our data are consistent with a physically - motivated model from @xcite , in which the star formation is instantaneously regulated by the gas mass , gas inflow , and mass loss by outflows .",
    "this model well reproduces a rapid decline in metallicity at high sfrs as shown in our data ( figure [ fig : fmr_lilly13 ] ) .    to conclude",
    ", our study has established the rest - frame optical emission - line properties of star - forming galaxies at @xmath14 and identified the processes likely responsible for differences with local samples such as shown with the bpt diagram .",
    "the fmos - cosmos project and other related efforts have enabled us to take an important step forward in understanding the evolution of the interstellar medium in galaxies at the peak epoch of the cosmic star formation history that will be carried forward by the next - generation multi - object spectrographs ( e.g. , subaru / pfs , vlt / moons ) .",

    "as described in section [ sec : agnrem ] , we remove agns from our star - forming galaxy samples for all analyses in this paper . our data , as presented on line - ratio diagrams ( figures [ fig : bpt ] , [ fig : bpt_s2 ] and [ fig : n2xs2 ] ) , shows no strong signature of ionizing radiation from agn .",
    "however , the possibility that weak and/or obscured agns affect the results can not be completely ruled out . here",
    ", we assess the contribution of such hidden agns on the results based on the co - added spectra .",
    "x - ray emission is an effective indicator of the existence of agn .",
    "we measure the average x - ray luminosities of our fmos galaxies by stacking the _ chandra x - ray observatory_/advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis - i ) images from the _ chandra_-cosmos legacy survey @xcite using the cstack tool ( v4.3 ; @xcite ) . to examine how the x - ray luminosity depends on the exclusion of individually - identified agns , we compare three samples with different criteria of the removal of possible agns ; 1 ) no agn cut is applied , 2 ) excluding individual x - ray detected sources , and 3 ) excluding all possible agn candidates ( x - ray sources , @xmath412 , or identified with the bpt diagram ; see section [ sec : agnrem ] ) .",
    "the last case is implemented for the results based on stacking analysis throughout the paper .",
    "figure [ fig : xray_imgs ] shows the stacked x - ray images in five bins of stellar mass , separately in two bandpasses ( soft : 0.52 kev , hard : 28 kev ) , from the two samples without ( case 1 ) and with ( case 3 ) agn removal .",
    "the average count rate is converted into flux assuming a spectrum with @xmath413 and a galactic column density @xmath414 .",
    "the average rest - frame x - ray luminosity is calculated as equation 4 in @xcite , with a median redshift ( @xmath415 ) .",
    "table [ tb : xrayflux ] lists the x - ray luminosities and associated errors in each bin .",
    "when no agn cut is applied ( case 1 ) , the x - ray emission is significantly detected in the two most massive bins at @xmath62 in both the soft and hard bandpasses . when the agn cut is applied ( case 2 and 3 ) , only the most massive bin ( @xmath416 )",

    "the mean sfrs are derived from dust - corrected h@xmath1 luminosity ( see section [ sec : sfrdet ] ) .",
    "following @xcite , we compare our data with an sfr@xmath462 relation for star - forming galaxies derived by and a relation with three times higher x - ray luminosity , which corresponds to @xmath463 times the rms scatter of the @xmath464sfr relation , to distinguish agns from non - agn .",
    "we compare the measurements for the samples with the different x - ray exclusion criteria ( cases 1 , 2 , and 3 ) .",
    "we see that @xmath461 is correlated with sfr at @xmath465 ( @xmath466 ) in all the cases and that the removal of individual x - ray detected sources primarily affects the average @xmath291-ray luminosity of the more massive bins . as a result of the agn exclusion ,",
    "the x - ray luminosities are reduced down to the level where the residual contribution from agn is likely to be negligible in three higher stellar mass bins . for two lower mass bins , upper limits on @xmath461",

    "different symbols shows the measurements for different cases of the agn removal ( triangles  no agn removed ; squares  without x - ray - detected sources ; filled circles  without all potential agn candidates ; see the text ) .",
    "an sfr@xmath467 relation for star - forming galaxies from and a relation with three times higher @xmath461 are shown by the solid and dashed lines , respectively.,width=336 ]    figure [ fig : lx_sfr ] indicates that , once the individually - detected agns are removed , the contribution to the x - ray luminosities in the stack from unidentified agns is small , and that levels of the residual x - ray luminosity are comparable to the levels that are normally expected for star - forming galaxies ( solid line in figure [ fig : lx_sfr ] ) . while the limit of the lowest mass bin does not reject a probability that a contribution from agns exists , the agn contribution can be expected to be negligible in such a range of stellar mass .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the impact from agn is small in our stacking analysis enough to appropriately assess the properties of star - forming hii regions over the entire stellar mass range spanned by our sample ."
