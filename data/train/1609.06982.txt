    "urbanization , measured by the fraction of people living in urban areas , gradually increased in modern countries with a quick growth since the middle of the 19@xmath4 century until reaching values around @xmath5 in most european countries @xcite .",
    "this process depends in general on several economic variables and is connected to transportation technologies @xcite . although urban development and the distribution of residential activity in urban areas are long - standing problems tackled by economists and geographers  @xcite a quantitative understanding of the different processes characterizing this phenomenon is still lacking . among the first empirical analysis on population density , meuriot @xcite provided a large number of density maps of european cities during the nineteenth century , and clark  @xcite proposed the first quantitative analysis of empirical data . in  @xcite anas presents an economic model for the dynamics of urban residential growth , and in regional models describe the population dynamics of systems divided into zones characterised by a set of socio - economic indicators and that exchange with one another population , goods , capital , etc . according to some optimization rule . in this framework , the authors of @xcite proposed a dynamical central place model highlighting the importance of both determinism and fluctuations in the evolution of urban systems . in  @xcite , the author reviews different approaches used to model population dynamics in cities and in particular the ecological approach , where ideas from mathematical ecology models are used to study urban systems .",
    "an example is given by  @xcite where phase portraits of differential equations bring qualitative insights about urban systems behavior .",
    "other important theoretical approaches comprise the classical alonso - muth - mills model @xcite developped in urban economics , and also numerical simulations based on cellular automata @xcite .    for most of these studies ,",
    "numerical models usually require a large number of parameters that makes it difficult to test their validity and to identify the main mechanisms governing the urbanization process .",
    "on the other hand , theoretical approaches propose in general a large set of coupled equations that are difficult to handle and amenable to quantitative predictions that can be tested against data .",
    "in addition , even if a qualitative understanding is brought by these theoretical models , empirical tests are often lacking .    the recent availability of geolocalized , historical data ( such as in @xcite for example ) from world cities  @xcite has the potential to change this state and allows to revisit with a fresh eye these long - standing problems .",
    "many cities created open - data websites @xcite and the city of new york ( us ) played an important role with the release of the pluto dataset ( short for property land use tax lot output ) , where tax lot records contain a lot of information about the urbanization process .",
    "for example , in addition to the location , property value , square footage etc , this dataset gives access to the construction date for each building .",
    "this type of geolocalized data at a very small spatial scale allows to monitor the urbanization process in time and at a very good spatial resolution .",
    "these datasets allow in particular to produce ` age maps ' where the construction date of buildings is displayed on a map ( see figure 1 for the example of the bronx borough in new york city ) .",
    "century , followed by the construction in some localized areas of buildings in the second half of the 20@xmath4 century .",
    "( see material and methods for details on the dataset ) . ]",
    "many age building maps are now available : chicago  @xcite .",
    "new york city ( us )  @xcite , ljubljana ( slovenia )  @xcite , reykjavik ( iceland )  @xcite , etc .",
    "in addition to be visually attractive  @xcite , these maps together with new mapping tools ( such as the urban layers proposed in @xcite ) provide qualitative insights into the history of specific buildings and also into the evolution of entire neighborhoods .",
    "palmer  @xcite studied the evolution of the city of portland ( oregon , us ) from 1851 and observed that only 942 buildings are still left from the end of the 19th century , while 75,434 buildings were built at the end of the 20th century and are still standing , followed by a steady decline of new buildings construction since 2005 .",
    "inspired by palmer s map , plahuta  @xcite constructed a map of building ages in his home town of ljubljana , slovenia , and proposed a video showing the growth of this city from 1500 until now  @xcite .",
    "plahuta observed that the number of new buildings constructed each year displays huge spikes that signalled important events : an important spike occurred a few years after a major earthquake hit the area in 1899 when people were able to rebuild and other periods of rebuilding occurred after the two world wars . in the case of los angeles ( us ) ,",
    "the ` built : la project ' shows the ages of almost every building in the city and allows to reveal the city growth over time  @xcite .",
    "these different datasets allow thus to monitor at a very small spatial resolution the urbanization process .",
    "in particular , for a given district or zone , we can ask quantitative questions about the evolution of the population and of the number of buildings .",
    "surprisingly enough , such a dual information is difficult to find and  up to our knowledge  was not studied at the quantitative level .",
    "here , we use data for different cities ( chicago , @xmath0 ; london , @xmath1 ; new york city , @xmath2 ; paris , @xmath3 ) in order to answer questions about these fundamental quantities . in particular , we will show that the number of buildings versus the population follows the same unique pattern for all cities studied here .",
    "we then propose an explanation for the existence of such a pattern and provide a theoretical model and empirical evidences supporting it .",
    "we investigate the urban growth of four different cities : chicago ( us ) , london ( uk ) , new york ( us ) , and paris ( france ) . an important discussion concerns the choice of the scale at which we study the urbanization process .",
    "we have to analyze the urbanization process at a spatial scale that is large enough in order to obtain statistical regularities , but not too large as different zones may evolve differently . indeed geographers observed that the population density is not homogeneous and decreases in general with the distance to the center  @xcite .",
    "also , during the evolution of most cities , they tend to spread out with the density decreasing in central districts and increasing in the outer ones  @xcite .",
    "we thus choose to focus on the evolution of administrative districts of each city as at this level we can get insight about the growth process and exclude longer term processes . more precisely , we considered the @xmath6 boroughs of new york , the @xmath7 sides of chicago , the @xmath8 arrondissements of paris and the @xmath9 london districts . also , in this way we do not have to tackle the difficult problem of city definition and its impact on various measures @xcite and focus on the urbanization process of a given zone with fixed surface area .",
    "the datasets for these cities come from different sources ( see materials and methods ) and cover different time periods .",
    "@xmath0 for chicago , @xmath10 for london , @xmath2 for new york , and @xmath3 for paris .",
    "an important limitation that guided us for choosing these cities is the simultaneous availability of building age and historical data for district population . in the following , in order to provide an historical context , we will first measure the evolution of the population density and then anayze the evolution of the number of buildings in a given district and its population .      in order to get a first understanding of the urban growth behavior of these different cities , we begin with an empirical analysis of the evolution of urban density on a fixed geographical area . in fig .  [ fig : popdensity ]",
    "we show the average population density for the four cities studied here .",
    "this plot reveals that these different cities follow similar dynamics . after a positive growth and a population increase that accelerates around @xmath11 ,",
    "we observe a density peak . after this peak ,",
    "the density decreases ( even sharply in the case of nyc ) or stays roughly constant . in the last years , new york city , paris and london display a re - densification period",
    "this first figure highlights the existence of a seemingly ` universal ' pattern governing the urbanization process .",
    "these large cities are divided in districts that usually display different properties and in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] we plot the time evolution of some district densities .",
    "we indeed observe that they display different behaviors ."

    "<S> the recent availability of geolocalized historical data allows to address quantitatively spatial features of the time evolution of urban areas . here , we discuss how the number of buildings evolves with population and we show on different datasets ( chicago , @xmath0 ; london , @xmath1 ; new york city , @xmath2 ; paris , @xmath3 ) that this curve evolves in a universal way with three distinct phases . after an initial pre - urbanization phase , the first phase is a rapid growth of the number of buildings versus population . in a second regime , where residences are converted into offices and stores , the population decreases while the number of buildings stays approximatively constant . in another subsequent  modern  phase , the number of buildings and the population grow again and correspond to a re - densification of cities . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a simple model based on these simple mechanisms to explain the first two regimes and show that it is in excellent agreement with empirical observations . </S>",
    "<S> these results bring evidences for the possibility of constructing a simple model that could serve as a tool for understanding quantitatively urbanization and the future evolution of cities . </S>"
