    "a fractal billiard table is a planar billiard table @xmath1 where the boundary @xmath2 is a fractal curve . in this paper , we take @xmath1 to be the @xmath0-fractal billiard table shown in figure [ fig : tfractal ] . in @xcite ,",
    "the fractal billiard table is a self - similar sierpinski carpet billiard table . in @xcite ,",
    "the fractal billiard table under consideration was the koch snowflake fractal billiard table . in @xcite ,",
    "recent results on the koch snowflake fractal billiard table and a self - similar sierpinski fractal billiard table are surveyed and the @xmath0-fractal billiard table is introduced ; preliminary results regarding the @xmath0-fractal billiard table were presented without proof .",
    "the @xmath0-fractal is not , strictly speaking , a self - similar set nor is it the finite union of self - similar sets .",
    "however , as we demonstrate at the end of this introduction , @xmath3 can be constructed by way of a particular iterated function system whose contraction mapping is denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "we illustrate in figure [ fig : tfractal ] how to construct the @xmath0-fractal billiard .",
    "we mention that the @xmath0-fractal is _ not _ the unique fixed point attractor of @xmath4 , this being a technical detail that does not take away from the fractality of the set .",
    "rather , the unique fixed point attractor of @xmath4 is of great interest and is hereafter referred to as the set of elusive points of the fractal billiard table ; such points are those that are never found in any finite approximation and a formal definition of _ elusive point _ is given in definition [ def : elusivepoint ] , with further elaboration given in remark [ rmk : elusivepointsnotalwaysattractor ]",
    ". the geometry of @xmath3 will aide us in our analysis of nontrivial paths ( in the sense of definition [ def : anontrivialpath ] ) and periodic orbits of the @xmath0-fractal billiard table .",
    ", @xmath5 , @xmath6 copies of the base @xmath0 ( shown on the left ) are appended , as shown in blue , ( or , for those not viewing the color version of this article , as dotted segments ) so as to construct the @xmath7 approximation . ]    the @xmath0-fractal enjoys particular properties not found in the koch snowflake and a self - similar sierpinski carpet .",
    "indeed , the koch snowflake @xmath8 is a nowhere differentiable curve bounding a region with finite area .",
    "furthermore , a self - similar sierpinski carpet contains no area .",
    "by contrast , the t - fractal bounds a region with finite area , yet a nontrivial portion of the boundary remains differentiable .",
    "hence , determining directions for which one gets periodic orbits is a much easier task compared to finding such orbits in the koch snowflake fractal billiard table .",
    "additionally , the set of directions for which one finds periodic orbits of the @xmath0-fractal billiard table is countably infinite , this being in contrast to a self - similar sierpinski carpet billiard table , where the number of directions for which periodic orbits occur is finite ( this finite value depending exclusively on the scaling ratio of the carpet ) .",
    "we note that propositions [ thm : whattheslopecannotbeintfrac ] and [ thm : whattheslopecanbeintfrac ] below first appeared without proof and were stated under more restrictive conditions in @xcite ; in this paper , we provide detailed proofs of these more general propositions , among many other results .",
    "the overarching themes of the research program on fractal billiards and fractal flat surfaces are topological and measure - theoretic in nature . in one instance , we seek to understand what constitutes a periodic orbit of a fractal billiard table . in another instance , we seek to understand when an orbit may be dense in a fractal billiard table .",
    "more generally , we eventually seek to answer the question asking which directions yield flows that are closed and which yield flows that are ergodic ( i.e. , where almost every orbit is uniformly distributed in the fractal billiard table ) .",
    "of course , all of this relies on the existence of a well - defined billiard map and phase space .",
    "defining such a map and space for a fractal billiard table is a very difficult task , one that the authors have yet to accomplish . in order to work towards the abovementioned goals in the absence of a billiard map and phase space , we rely on the geometric properties of the fractal to construct what we are calling nontrivial paths of a fractal billiard table .",
    "we are ultimately interested in nontrivial paths reaching elusive points . ] of a fractal billiard table . in the case of the @xmath0-fractal billiard ( and , likewise , the koch snowflake fractal billiard table ) , any pointmass on a trajectory that results in the pointmass reaching an elusive point does so in an increasingly confined manner .",
    "it is then natural to ask how a pointmass will `` reflect '' off from an elusive point and under what conditions will such an orbit    1 .",
    "form a periodic orbit of the fractal billiard table ( i.e. , return to the elusive point infinitely often in the same direction ) , 2 .",
    "terminate at an elusive point , because of some sort of inherent ambiguity , 3 .   or manage to fill all or part of some nontrivial 2-dimensional subset of @xmath3 ( either uniformly or not ) .",
    "we answer in part these questions by giving a variety of sufficient conditions under which 1 ) a periodic orbit of @xmath3 exists and , more generally , 2 ) a nontrivial path . ] of @xmath3 exists ; see definition [ def : anontrivialpath ] . in the case of the @xmath0-fractal billiard ( and , also , the koch snowflake fractal billiard ) , there are trajectories yielding orbits that reach elusive points . the geometric properties of the @xmath0-fractal billiard lend themselves well to the description of such trajectories , this being the major focus of  [ sec : sequencesofcompatibleperiodicorbits ] and  [ sec : nontrivialpathsinthetfractalbilliardtable ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : background ] , the necessary background is given so that a reader not familiar with mathematical billiards or the terminology developed in earlier works may be able to understand the remainder of the paper .",
    "sufficient conditions for sequences of compatible periodic orbits are given in ",
    "[ sec : sequencesofcompatibleperiodicorbits ] . in  [ sec : nontrivialpathsinthetfractalbilliardtable ] , we build upon the concepts developed in ",
    "[ sec : sequencesofcompatibleperiodicorbits ] and show ( via an explicit construction ) that there exist nontrivial paths and periodic orbits in the @xmath0-fractal billiard @xmath3 .",
    "then , in  [ sec : anontrivialpathinanirrationaldirection ] , we introduce an important example of a nontrivial path with an initial direction that is irrational , yet reaches an elusive point of the @xmath0-fractal billiard in a way that is similar to how particular nontrivial paths with rational initial directions reach their respective elusive points .",
    "this is an unintuitive behavior that begins to depart from the classical theory of billiards on square tiled billiard tables . finally , in ",

    "for the reader s easy reference , we provide in this section various definitions appearing in previous joint works ; see @xcite .",

    "particular definitions ( e.g. , the definitions for _ compatible initial conditions _ and _ a sequence of compatible initial conditions _ ) will be phrased in full generality so that the reader may be able to understand the results appearing in the abovementioned works .    in order to understand the following notations and definitions , we first discuss the phase space for the billiard dynamics on a polygonal billiard table .",
