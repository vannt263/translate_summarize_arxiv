    "when atoms within an ultra - cold gas are excited to rydberg levels , they experience long - range interactions which can block further excitations , leading to a strongly correlated many - body state . this effect might be useful for quantum information @xcite as well as for fundamental studies of many - body physics and was observed in several experiments @xcite .",

    "this distance @xmath2 is slightly larger than the instantaneous blockade radius at the moment when the laser phase is flipped . at the _ instantaneous blockade radius _ @xmath3 the rydberg state density - density correlation function drops sharply to zero .",
    "initially @xmath3 equals zero , later growing towards its saturation value @xmath4 , as the longer duration of the pulse allows an increasingly finer energy resolution .",
    "after most rydberg atoms that were excited in the first half of the pulse returned to the ground state , the majority of the remainder has their nearest excited neighbor at a distance between @xmath2 and @xmath5 .",

    "our results imply that the echo technique can be used to manipulate the nearest - neighbor distribution in the rydberg fraction of the gas .",
    "such manipulations could be used for example to initiate dynamics due to dipole - dipole forces @xcite from a well specified non - equilibrium state .",
    "similar correlations between rydberg atoms are created if a two - step excitation scheme with a strongly decaying intermediate state is used  @xcite . in that case",

    "the height of this peak increases as more and more atoms are transferred back to the ground state [ panel ( @xmath109 ) ] . just before the end of the pulse , for densities as low as in fig .",
    "[ echo_tevol ] , a dip appears in the correlation peak like that shown in panel ( c ) .",
    "this feature starts to occur at the time when the probability for a single excitation in the system drops below that for double excitation .",
    "the underlying physics requires only binary interaction : consider a pair of atoms separated by some distance @xmath94 .",
    "let us write the quantum state of this pair as @xmath110 only in the state @xmath111 where both atoms are excited to a rydberg level do they experience any interaction .",
    "the correlation function in state ( [ simplestate ] ) is @xmath112 now consider @xmath97 after the pulse for three different atomic separations : ( i ) if the atoms are very close @xmath113 double excitation can be considered fully suppressed .",

    "( iii ) in the intermediate range we can neither neglect double excitations nor interaction . consider the very end of the pulse : the amplitudes @xmath119 and @xmath120 have returned to their initial value of zero after the echo - pulse .",
    "in contrast @xmath121 is non - zero due to the dephasing .",
    "we then see that the atomic correlation function scales as @xmath122 , which is larger than one .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ echo_tevol ] , the distances @xmath94 with pairing correlations during the second half of the pulse are those where correlations change , as @xmath94 increases , from blockaded ( @xmath115 ) to uncorrelated ( @xmath116 ) during the first half of the pulse .",
    "we will call the spherical shell around each atom where neighbors have these distances the _ partial blockade shell_.    we find that the position of the maximum of the correlation function during the second half of the pulse depends only weakly on time .",

    "we then rescale the obtained number corresponding to a total initial number of @xmath133 atoms for illustrative purposes .",
    "it may seem counter - intuitive that the number of paired atoms rises even during the second half of the pulse when atoms are predominantly deexcited .",
    "note however , that whether or not the rabi - coupling causes excitations or de - excitations depends on the relative populations _ and _ phases .",
    "the continuous increase of @xmath134 is again due to interaction induced decoherence .",
    "finally we describe two possibilities to experimentally detect the correlation dynamics : ( i ) via the effect of correlations on the number uncertainty in the rydberg fraction @xcite and ( ii ) via field ionization of the paired rydberg atoms .",
    "\\(i ) strong deviations from an uncorrelated state have been shown to affect the number statistics of the excited state fraction @xcite .",

    "the potential energy of the ions due to coulomb repulsion @xmath137 would subsequently be converted into kinetic energy . since",
    "only a small number of atoms occupies rydberg states , one could hope that the rydberg fraction is sufficiently dilute for coulomb - scattering to leave the initial kinetic energy distribution essentially unchanged .",
    "the peak in the nearest - neighbor distribution function @xmath138 then translates into a well visible maximum of the measured kinetic energy spectrum of the ions . for @xmath139",
    "the energy at the maximum is @xmath140 mev .",
    "the scenarios shown in the previous section are relatively weakly blockaded and assume a homogeneous distribution of atoms .",
    "in this section we study how an in - homogeneous distribution and changes of the overall density affect our results .    the basic picture is shown in fig .  [ echo_interact ] and fig .  [ echo_density ] . in fig .",
    "[ echo_interact ] we compare a variety of different densities .",
    "prominent features of this data are compared more directly in fig .",
    "[ echo_density ] .",
    "is is known that the echo - signal , i.e.  the fraction of rydberg excitations remaining after the pulse , increases as the density is increased @xcite . using the @xmath0-expansion , we can supply the analytical expression eq .",
    "( [ echosig ] ) for this increase . for the low densities",
    "where it is valid , it performs well as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ echo_density ]  ( a ) .",
    "other effects of increasing density are a decrease of the maximum correlations and an increase of the mandel - q factor for intermediate times ( @xmath141 ) . despite the decrease of the correlation peak height , we find that the paired fraction @xmath123 , defined by eq .",
    "( [ rfrac_direct ] ) almost reaches unity after the pulse , regardless of the density .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ echo_interact ]  ( e ) .",
    "we also show the development of the dip in the correlation peak in fig .",
    "[ echo_interact ]  ( f ) .",
    "we only see this feature for the lowest densities considered .",
    "the reduction of correlation strength with increasing density can be understood from the nature of the distribution of excitations near the end of the pulse , using only classical arguments .",
    "let us assume a homogenous distribution of pairs of excited atoms within a volume @xmath142 , with a fixed distance @xmath2 between the partners of each pair .",
    "the distance @xmath2 then corresponds to the location of our pairing peak , ignoring its finite width .",
    "the orientation of pairs in space shall be isotropic .",
    "overall we thus have a distribution of positions for each pair : @xmath143 here , @xmath144 denotes the centre - of - mass position of a pair and @xmath145 its relative co - ordinate . assuming a total number of @xmath146 pairs we have a pair density @xmath147 and an excited atom density @xmath148 .",
    "the positions of the pairs themselves are correlated due to the dipole blockade , we thus assume that the centers of the pairs must be separated by more than a certain radius @xmath149 .",
    "the classical correlation function corresponding to our @xmath97 is @xmath150 in the numerator we have the expectation value for the number of joint occupations of the locations @xmath151 and @xmath152 by excited atoms . in the denominator",
    "@xmath153 denotes the expectation value for the number of excited atoms at location @xmath154 , which is @xmath155 .",
    "the integration @xmath156 is over the solid angle of orientations of @xmath157 with respect to @xmath158 .",
    "we are now interested exclusively in the value of the correlation function at the pairing peak , located at @xmath159 . for simplicity",
    "we assume contributions to the numerator of eq .",
    "( [ classicalg2 ] ) stem only from cases where the atoms at both locations were constituents of the same pair .",
    "this should be justified when the pairs are sufficiently dilute that their mean distance is much larger than @xmath2 .",
    "we can then write @xmath160 .    with these simplifying assumptions , we find eq .",
    "( [ classicalg2 ] ) equals @xmath161 for the simple pair distribution described above . using @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 from the @xmath0-expansion ,",
    "we find overall that the correlation strength scales like @xmath6 .",
    "this behavior is roughly confirmed by the simulation results as shown in fig .",
    "[ echo_density ]  ( b ) .",
    "it is consistent with a paired fraction @xmath123 that shows almost no density dependence near the end of the pulse : for each excitation we calculate @xmath165 to obtain the number of excited neighbors in an interval @xmath166 $ ] .",
    "since @xmath167 scales like @xmath168 , while @xmath97 scales like @xmath6 , we can understand how the final paired fraction can remain almost the same even though the density is varied .",
    "we verified that the relation @xmath169 remains qualitatively unchanged if we model similar echo - pulses in a fictitious system with a @xmath170 long range interaction .",
    "this lends further support to the simple explanation in terms of the density of available pairs .",

    "the peak - density @xmath173 is chosen as for case ( ii ) .",
    "[ echo_interact ] includes the correlation function averaged over all atomic pairs in the cloud for this case .",
    "it is determined in the same manner as described in section  [ correldyn ] .",
    "one could expect that the inhomogeneity washes out the signal in the correlation function .",
    "instead its visibility is even better than for the homogenous case with equal peak - density , owing to the presence of low density regions in the atomic cloud .",
    "for lower density the pairing effect is more prominent as we already argued .",
    "we also do not expect a strong spatial variation of the preferred distance throughout the cloud , since the blockade radius @xmath3 depends only weakly on the atomic density ( i.e.  the saturated many - body blockade radius scales like @xmath174 @xcite ) .",
    "hence the location of the correlation peak , situated near @xmath175 , is expected to vary only little throughout the sample .",
    "consequently there are only small effects of spatial averaging on the final result in the inhomogenous case considered here . to fully exclude that density inhomogeneities in an experiment would suppress the signature reported here",
    ", one ideally should consider a sample whose width greatly exceeds the characteristic range where the correlation peak is formed ( @xmath176 ) .",
    "this is however computationally intractable .",
    "the simple expression eq .  ( [ g2anal ] ) for two - body correlations in the @xmath0-expansion does not depend on density and hence can not capture its effect on correlation dynamics as shown in fig .",
