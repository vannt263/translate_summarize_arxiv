    "although mergers are rare today ( patton et al . 2000 , hereafter p2000 ) , cold dark matter @xmath12-body simulations show merger rates of halos increasing with redshift as @xmath1 , with @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "observations , however , have yielded results with @xmath14 @xcite",
    ". the diverse results are likely due to different pair criteria , observational techniques , selection effects , and cosmic variance ( abraham 1999 ; p2000 ) . to identify close pairs ,",

    "2003 ) on the 10 m keck ii telescope .",
    "the survey convers four fields , with field 1 ( extended groth strip ) being a strip of 0.25 @xmath22 2 deg@xmath23 and fields 2 , 3 , and 4 each being 0.5 @xmath22 2 deg@xmath23 .",

    "2004 , in preparation , for details ) , we compared the sample with successful redshifts to galaxies in the full photometric catalog that satisfy the limiting magnitude and two - color cuts . following analogous approaches by @xcite and p2002 , we calculate the spectroscopic weight @xmath34 of each galaxy as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the spectroscopic selection function derived from the @xmath37 magnitude , @xmath38 and @xmath39 colors , @xmath40band surface brightness @xmath41 , and local galaxy density of the galaxy itself . to correct for bias due to slit collisions @xcite , we also compute the angular weight , @xmath42 , as a function of angular separation @xmath43 ( p2002 ) . for @xmath44 , we find @xmath45 , a result confirmed with the deep2 mock catalog of @xcite .",
    "a major limitation on the direct measurement of merger fractions for galaxies is the difficulty in identifying on - going mergers , especially for distant galaxies .",
    "one alternative is to count only the pairs with projected separations @xmath46@xmath47 and relative line - of - sight heliocentric velocities @xmath46@xmath48 less than @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "a large fraction of pairs with physical separations less than 20 @xmath51 kpc and velocity difference less than 500 km  s@xmath10 appear to have disturbed morphologies or signs of interactions , and these galaxies are expected to merge within 0.5 gyr ( p2000 ) . in our work , close pairs are defined such that their projected separations satisfy 10 @xmath51 kpc @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 and their rest - frame relative velocities @xmath46@xmath48 are less than 500 km  s@xmath10 .",
    "we adopt an inner cutoff with a projected distance 10 @xmath51 so as to avoid the ambiguity between very close pairs and single galaxies with multiple star - forming knots .",
    "we choose values of @xmath49 = 30 , 50 , and 100 @xmath51 kpc , where 30 @xmath51 kpc is most likely to include genuine merger pairs , while the two larger separations provide larger samples and thus better statistics .",
    "to ensure the selection of the same types of galaxies at different redshifts in the presence of luminosity evolution , p2002 adopted a specific range in evolution - corrected absolute magnitude @xmath55 , defined as @xmath56 , where the evolution is parameterized as @xmath57 .",
    "following p2002 , we adopt @xmath58 as a primary model , and we also study the effect of different models on the pair statistics .",
    "we restrict the analysis to galaxies with luminosities @xmath59 for @xmath60 . since there is only a 2 mag range in our sample , and assuming a constant @xmath61 ratio , most observed pairs are thus major mergers , i.e. , mass ratios between 1 : 1 and 6 : 1 .",
    "using data from the deep2 fields 1 and 4 helps us reduce the effects of cosmic variance .",
    "following p2000 and p2002 , we compute the average number of companions per galaxy @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the total number of galaxies within the chosen magnitude range , @xmath64 is the spectroscopic weight for the @xmath65th companion belonging to the @xmath66th galaxy , and @xmath67 is the angular weight for each pair as described in section 2 .",
    "details of the weighting scheme can be found in section 5 of p2002 and references therein .",
    "this quantity @xmath68 is similar to the pair fraction when there are few triplets or higher order @xmath12-tuples in the sample , which is the case here . in this work ,",
    "@xmath68 will sometimes simply be referred to as the pair fraction .",
    "figure 1 shows @xmath68 versus redshift @xmath69 for a sample with @xmath70 km  s@xmath10 and 10 @xmath51 kpc @xmath71 @xmath46@xmath72 with @xmath73 30 , 50 , and 100 @xmath51 kpc , respectively . in the case of using @xmath74 50 @xmath51 kpc",
    ", we find 79 paired galaxies out of 2547 galaxies .",
    "the derived @xmath68 is @xmath75 at @xmath76 and increases to 10% at @xmath77 .",
    "figure 1 also shows results from the ssrs2 ( southern sky redshift survey ; p2000 ) at @xmath78 and cnoc2 ( canadian network for observational cosmology ; p2002 ) at @xmath79 , after corrections that adopt the same cosmology and the same luminosity range .",
    "the deep2 sample is @xmath37-band - selected and hence , for redshifts greater than 0.8 , is biased toward galaxies that are bright in the rest - frame uv , i.e. , against faint red galaxies , especially at redshifts @xmath80 . to avoid this bias ,",
    "we divide our sample into blue and red galaxies using the color bimodality feature and then repeat the calculation of @xmath68 using @xmath74 50 @xmath51 kpc for blue galaxies at @xmath69 = 0.3 ( cnoc2 ) , 0.6 , and 0.85 bins ( deep2 ) . when using only blue galaxies , the values of the pair fraction @xmath81 decrease at @xmath69 = 0.3 and 0.85 but increase at @xmath69 = 0.6 compared to the results using the original sample .",
    "the changes in the measured value of @xmath68 could be up to a factor of 2 , depending on the field and redshift .",
    "to mitigate the underestimation of the pair fraction in the redshift bin @xmath82 , we calculate a corrected @xmath68 at @xmath83 as @xmath84,\\ ] ] shown as open triangles in figure 1 . parameterizing the evolution of @xmath68 as @xmath85",
    ", we find that the best fit of @xmath86 is @xmath87 with @xmath88 for @xmath89 @xmath51 kpc , @xmath90 with @xmath91 for @xmath92 @xmath51 kpc , and @xmath93 with @xmath94 for @xmath95 @xmath51 kpc . for the highest redshift bin , @xmath96 instead of @xmath68 is used for the above fitting procedure .",
    "the best fits are shown as long - dashed curves in figure 1 .",
    "for three different choices of @xmath49 , we find only a small increase of @xmath68 from redshifts @xmath97 to @xmath15 . in figure 1",
    ", we also list the upper limits of errors from the cosmic variance for each redshift bin calculated by assuming a spherical geometry of the survey volume . incorporating the cosmic variance into the fitting procedure",
    "slightly raises @xmath98 to @xmath99 for @xmath92 @xmath51 kpc .",
    "the adopted choice of @xmath100 in the luminosity evolution model sets the luminosity range of the sample at each redshift and thus affects our results . to assess this effect , we repeat the pair analysis for other choices of @xmath101 .",
    "the luminosity ranges are chosen such that they are locked to @xmath102 at @xmath103 .",
    "using @xmath74 50 @xmath51 kpc and an upper redshift limit of @xmath104 , we find that @xmath98 varies from @xmath105 for @xmath106 , @xmath107 for @xmath108 , @xmath109 for @xmath100 , to @xmath110 for @xmath111 . in figure 2 ,",
    "we plot @xmath68 as a function of absolute @xmath112-band magnitude ( @xmath113 ) for three redshift samples .",
    "a clear dependence of @xmath68 on @xmath113 is evident .",
    "the trend that @xmath98 decreases with @xmath101 can be understood as the result of including fainter galaxies and thus having larger @xmath68 at lower redshifts when adopting higher @xmath101 values .",
    "nevertheless , even with the lowest choice of @xmath106 to maximize @xmath98 , models with @xmath114 are ruled out at a 3 @xmath115 level of confidence for all three choices of separation limits .",
    "the comoving merger rate , usually defined as the number of mergers per unit time per comoving volume , can be estimated as @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the time - scale for physically associated pairs to merge , @xmath118 denotes the fraction of galaxies in close pairs that will merge in @xmath117 , and @xmath119 is the comoving number density of galaxies .",
    "the factor 0.5 is to convert the number of galaxies into the number of merger events .",
    "the merger rate calculated above , however , is not suitable for comparison to the merger rate derived from morphological approaches .",
    "the reason is that while we have restricted the luminosity range of companions to compute @xmath68 , the morphological approach does not . to correct for this restriction , equation ( 3 )",
    "can be modified : @xmath120 where the added parameter @xmath121 accounts for the excess number of companions failing to fall into our sample . assuming that the maximum mass ratio needed to yield significant morphology distortions is 4 : 1 , we calculate the value of @xmath121 as 1.24 for @xmath59 using the local luminosity function @xcite .",
    "@xmath117 depends on the relative mass ratio , dynamical orbit , and detailed structure of the two merging galaxies , and thus it varies from case to case . here",
    "we adopt @xmath117 = 0.5 gyr , a value suggested by @xmath12-body simulations and simplified models ( mihos 1995 ; p2000 ) .",
    "the value @xmath118 is approximately 0.5 for close pairs with 5 @xmath51 kpc @xmath71 @xmath46@xmath47 @xmath122 @xmath51 kpc and @xmath70 kms@xmath10 ; this estimate is based on morphological studies of local close pairs ( p2000 ) .",
    "nevertheless , both @xmath117 and @xmath118 remain uncertain .",
    "the derived merger rates are displayed in figure 3 .",
    "here we have applied the pair fraction evolution of @xmath123 derived for the @xmath92 @xmath51 kpc case to the @xmath124 ( ssrs2 ) @xmath125 result for pairs with 5 @xmath51 kpc @xmath71 @xmath46@xmath47 @xmath122 @xmath51 kpc .",
    "the parameter @xmath119 is calculated as the sum of the number of galaxies in the adopted magnitude range , each weighted by its spectroscopic weight and divided by the comoving volume occupied by the included sources .",
    "the errors shown for deep2 measurements represent @xmath126 variations that are typical for close pair counts in our sample , and they do not include the uncertainties of @xmath117 and @xmath118 . also shown are the results from @xcite , who relied on morphologically identified mergers for @xmath127 using _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) data in the hubble deep field - north ( _ filled triangles _ )",
    ". clearly , the comoving merger rate in our data changes little with redshift . from @xmath128 to @xmath6 , the average is @xmath129 @xmath8 mpc@xmath9 gyr@xmath10 for @xmath130 .",
    "this value is about 1 order of magnitude lower than the average merger rate for galaxies with @xmath131 derived by conselice et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "finally , we calculate the merger remnant fraction , @xmath132 , defined as the fraction of present - day galaxies that have undergone major mergers ( p2000 ) . adopting the merger fraction @xmath118 to be 0.5 and @xmath117 to be 0.5 gyr",
    ", we estimate , using equation ( 32 ) in p2000 , that about @xmath4 of present @xmath5 luminous galaxies have undergone major mergers since @xmath6 .",
    "studies up to @xmath21 using pair counts have found a wide range in the evolution of merger rates .",
    "for example , based on roughly 300 canada - france redshift survey galaxies measured with _",
    "hst _ , le fvre et al .",
    "( 2000 ) concluded that the pair fraction evolves with @xmath133 while the fraction of merger candidates evolves with @xmath134 .",
    "in contrast , carlberg et al .",
    "( 2000 ) measured the mean fractional pair luminosity from @xmath69 = 0.2 to 1 and found no evolution with @xmath135 , consistent with our result .",
    "since the pair fraction depends on adopted luminosity limits , differences among studies may depend on the choice of luminosity evolution models .",
    "@xcite , e.g. , applied no corrections while @xcite adopted the q=1 model , as we do here .",
    "the key advantages of our pair sample over previous surveys include having measurements at @xmath136 , a larger sample , and more restrictive pair criteria than those adopted by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy in the derived merger rates at @xmath137 between our estimates and those from @xcite is more difficult to reconcile . besides the choice of luminosity ranges and the uncertainties in @xmath118 and @xmath117",
    ", other factors may explain the discrepancy .",
    "first , cosmic variance can always come into play , since most morphological studies have been forced to use the few small fields covered deeply by _",
    "hst _ imaging , whereas pair - count surveys cover much larger areas .",
    "second , the two approaches may sample interacting and merging galaxies at different stages , with morphological approaches identifying very advanced mergers and merger remnants , while the pairs detect some of the same systems before distortions are discernible . matching the derived merger rates from these two approaches",
    "requires knowledge of the precise timescales of close pairs and of the duration time for the appearance of distorted morphologies .",
    "however , neither is well understood yet .",
    "third , while our close pairs identify only major mergers , morphological criteria may be sensitive to minor mergers as well .",
    "finally , both the pair - count and morphology methods are subject to systematic uncertainties that require detail modeling ( bell 2004 ) . given the current discrepancy in results , it behooves us to study the connection between kinematic pairs and morphologically disturbed galaxies at various redshifts , both via observational approaches ( p2000 ; j. lotz et al .",
    "2004 , in preparation ) and through numerical simulations ( t. j. cox et al .",
    "2004 , in preparation ) .",
    "the merger rates from pair counts are also an excellent test for those estimated from @xmath12-body simulations , since the former reveal the behavior of luminous baryons while the latter reflect the behavior of dark halos .",
    "gottlber et al .",
    "( 2001 ) defined merger rates in @xmath12-body simulations as equivalent to the major merger fraction per gigayear by tracing the formation and evolutionary history of each halo .",
    "these fractions will differ from the pair fractions roughly by a constant , and therefore their redshift evolution is amenable to direct comparisons .",
    "they found merger rates evolving as @xmath138 up to @xmath139 .",
    "this theoretical value of @xmath140 is significantly higher than the @xmath141 we find from observed pair counts . we should , however , be wary about this comparison for the following reasons .",
    "first , definitions of merger rates in observations and simulations may not be consistent with each other , since the halos and visible galaxies span different size scales and since @xmath12-body simulations also suffer limitations in resolution .",
    "second , the merger rates / fractions of halos are likely to be a function of halo mass , which is suggested by our finding that the galaxy pair fraction is a function of luminosity .",
    "pair count works using @xmath31-band - selected samples ( e.g. , bundy et al .",
    "2004 ) can also provide another avenue for testing the mass dependence of merger rates since the @xmath31-band luminosity is more representative of any underlying stellar mass and suffers less from evolution corrections .",
    "although preliminary , mock catalog simulations by e. van kampen et al . ( 2004 , in preparation ) predict flat slopes for the pair - count fractions ( see fig .",
    "3 of bell 2004 ) , just as seen in our observations .",
    "we expect a dramatic improvement in our understanding of merger histories via pair counts after more realistic comparisons to simulations are possible and especially after a 10-fold increase in sample size when deep2 is complete in 2005 .",
