    "ngc 4051 is a nearby , 17.9 mpc , spiral ( sbbc ) galaxy hosting a narrow line seyfert 1 nucleus that is time variable in the radio @xcite , near - infrared @xcite , visible @xcite , uv and x - rays ( * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "consequently , ngc 4051 has been the target of several reverberation mapping campaigns culminating in an estimate for the size of the region emitting the bright balmer lines of hydrogen ( h ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "since this low luminosity active galactic nucleus ( llagn ) is radiating at @xmath4 1% the eddington limit @xcite the gas kinematics are dominated by gravity which allows the size of the emitting region to be estimated , independently , by modeling the shape of the balmer lines , given a kinematic model for the h gas . the purpose of this @xmath6 is to report two new results .",
    "first , if the gas kinematics are dominated by inflow , then the reverberation radius measured for ngc 4051 coincides with the radius that also defines the full width at zero intensity for the h@xmath0 emission line .",
    "ngc 4051 is the second such llagn , after ngc 3227 @xcite , to yield this result with potentially important consequences for black hole ( bh ) mass determinations in these and other time - variable - sub - eddington agns .",
    "second , the bright h@xmath0 line requires a factor of 3  4 more ionizing photons than can be supplied by a simple power law connecting the lyman edge to the x - rays .",
    "the ionizing deficit can be alleviated by invoking a @xmath4 10@xmath5 k blackbody , evidence for which was first presented by @xcite . following @xcite , we identify the blackbody with emission from an accretion disk .",
    "these results are described in more detail in section 3 and discussed in section 4 where we highlight the imperative of including photoionization explicitly in any modeling that attempts to decipher the morphological and kinematic information conveyed in emission lines .",
    "our conclusions concerning the photoionization of the hii region surrounding the agn in ngc 4051 follow in section 5 .",
    "we begin , however , with section 2 where we acquaint the reader with the h@xmath0 emission line in ngc 4051 , as observed with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) aboard the _ hubble space telescope ( hst)_.",
    "ngc 4051 has been rather neglected as there is only one stis observation of the h@xmath0 emission line in the _ hst _ data archive , obtained march 12 , 2000 with the g750 m grating under pid 8228 ( table 1 ) .",
    "two dithered exposures showing the h@xmath0 emission line were shifted using the @xmath7 task @xmath8 prior to combining with the @xmath7 task @xmath9 .",
    "subsequently , the @xmath7 task @xmath10 was used to perform a 7 pixel wide extraction along the slit direction and centered on the nucleus , sampling @xmath11 80% of the encircled energy for an unresolved point source @xcite .",
    "ngc 4051 is classified as a narrow line seyfert 1 ( nls1 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which , technically , is an oxymoron because seyfert 1 galaxies have broad lines by definition .",
    "the hst spectrum , presented in figure 1 , reveals a bright , single - peaked , but narrow line with a fwhm @xmath4 600 km / s .",
    "however , the line exhibits a very broad base with full - width at zero intensity ( fwzi ) of at least 4000 km / s .",
    "figure 1 illustrates how the @xmath7-contributed task , @xmath12 , was used to model and subtract the two [ n ii ] vacuum wavelength , @xmath136549.85  and @xmath146585.28  , emission lines , leaving an unadulterated h@xmath0 emission line .",
    "emission line fluxes are reported in table 2 for the [ n ii ] , h@xmath0 and vacuum wavelength @xmath14 6718.29  and @xmath14 6732.67  [ s ii ] emission lines .",
    "the number of ionizing photons produced by the central agn in ngc 4051 can be estimated using the prescription in @xcite where the 912 @xmath15 flux is extrapolated from the 1450 @xmath15 flux using a uv spectral index @xmath0 = 2 ( where _ f_@xmath16 ) reported in @xcite .",
    "an analysis , by @xcite , of contemporaneous uv and x - ray measurements obtained in the year 2001 reveal that the x - rays and consequently the uv - x - ray spectral index , @xmath17 , varies widely on a monthly timescale with values ranging between 1.17 and 1.51 . using this information",
    "one can show that in the _ high state _",
    ", corresponding to @xmath17 = 1.17 , the central agn generates 1.5 @xmath1 10@xmath18 ionizing photons / sec whereas in the _ low state _ , corresponding to @xmath17 = 1.51 , this number decreases to 1.0 @xmath1 10@xmath18 ionizing photons / sec .",
    "in contrast , the number of ionizing photons required to generate the h@xmath0 emission line luminosity observed in the year 2000 ( see table 3 ) corresponds to 4.1 @xmath1 10@xmath18 ionizing photons / sec , assuming case b recombination at a temperature of 10@xmath19 k. thus , there appears to be rather a large , factor of 3 to 4 , discrepancy , otherwise known as an ionizing deficit , between the number of ionizing photons produced by the central agn and the number required by the ionized gas , as previously suspected by @xcite .",
    "ionizing deficits have been noted for other llagns by @xcite but , to our knowledge , ngc 4051 is the first nls1 .    even though ngc 4051 is time variable in the x - rays and extreme uv @xcite , it is less so near the 13.6 ev ionization edge where most of the ionizing photons are produced @xcite .",
    "thus , one can not easily appeal to uv variability to reconcile the ionizing deficit for these non - contemporaneous uv - h@xmath0 observations .",
    "some of the broad h@xmath0 line emission may be enhanced by collisional excitation ; difficult to prove in the absence of contemporaneous h@xmath20 and h@xmath21 line measurements , but in ngc 3227 , for example , collisional excitation appears to brighten the h@xmath0 line emission by only @xmath4 44% @xcite .",
    "there is also little evidence for significant galactic or internal extinction based on x - ray observations @xcite . on the other hand , the ionizing deficit measured for ngc 4051 _",
    "can _ be alleviated by invoking a 10@xmath5 k blackbody , peaking at 20 ev , which would be obscured from direct observation by the high photoionization cross - section of neutral h. however , tantalizing evidence for the tail of such a blackbody was presented previously by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their figure 5 ) based on _ rosat _ data and more recently rendered as the emission from an accretion disk by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their figure 2 ) .",
    "the photoionization requirements of such an accretion disk in relieving the ionizing deficit measured for ngc 4051 is discussed further in section 4.1 .",
    "most aficionados believe that agn activity is fueled by inflowing gas .",
    "concordantly , the distinctly triangular profile shape observed for the h@xmath0 emission line in ngc 4051 can be modeled as a steady - state spherically symmetric inflow , illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "the inflow model , described previously in @xcite , has just two free parameters ; @xmath22 and @xmath23 , corresponding to the inner and outer radii of the inflow that is ionized by the central agn and for which recombination radiation is observed . following the procedure described previously in @xcite , values for these two free - parameters that best represent the observed h@xmath0 emission line shape , and the associated 1@xmath24 uncertainties on these parameters ,",
    "were estimated by calculating reduced chi - squared ( @xmath25 ) for a grid of models spanning 9 and 10 values of the inner and outer radii , respectively . @xmath25",
    "minimum occurred for @xmath22 = 3.5 @xmath26 @xmath1 10@xmath19 @xmath27 where @xmath28 = @xmath29 ; the gravitational radius .",
    "only a lower limit could be obtained for the outer radius because @xmath25 asymptotes to a limiting minimum value at @xmath23 @xmath11 4.5 @xmath1 10@xmath30 @xmath27 as shown in figure 3 .",
    "adopting the reverberation bh mass of 1.73 @xmath1 10@xmath30 m@xmath31 , reported by @xcite , leads to a physical size for the inner radius , @xmath22 @xmath4 ( 3.4 @xmath26 ) lt - days , which is comparable to the reverberation radius of ( @xmath32 ) lt - days reported by @xcite , and ( @xmath33 ) lt - days reported by @xcite .",
    "the inner radius is slightly larger than the reverberation radius ( @xmath34 ) lt - days reported most recently by @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the outer radius of the ionized region corresponds to @xmath23 @xmath35 475 lt - days , which is much larger than any measures of the reverberation radius .",
    "thus , according to our analysis , the reverberation radius marks just the inner radius of a much larger volume of ionized gas .",
    "ngc 4051 is the second such agn , after ngc 3227 @xcite , to yield this result with important implications for bh mass determinations discussed further in section 4.2 .",
    "most reverberation mapping studies , to date , have measured the mean time - delay in the correlated response of , usually , the balmer emission lines to changes in the adjacent continuum , leading to an estimate of the _ mean radius of the blr _ ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "however , an often overlooked fact is that the time - variable component of the emission line , characterized by the parameter f@xmath36 , represents typically only @xmath4 10% of the total line flux ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , reverberation mapping is insensitive to @xmath4 90% of the line flux that is not variable , at least on the time - scales that these agns have been monitored .",
    "consequently , one can anticipate that reverberation mapping must be measuring just the _ inner radius _ of a much _ larger _ volume of ionized gas and is therefore not the _ mean radius of the blr _ at all .",
    "this anticipated result has now been demonstrated quantitatively for ngc 3227 @xcite and here for ngc 4051 . in both cases ,",
    "the reverberation radius consistently coincides with the inner radius of a much larger volume of partially ionized , inflowing gas",
    ". a magnified view of the blr in ngc 4051 is visualized in figure 4 illustrating the gas and dust reverberation radii measured by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "photoionization modeling , described in more detail in the following for ngc 4051 , reveals that in both agns , the reverberation radius coincides with a transition region ; from partially ionized to fully ionized h gas , as the agn is approached . collectively , these results have important implications for bh masses estimated using reverberation radii and the structure of the broad line region inferred from velocity - delay maps as discussed further in section 4.2 .",
    "the photoionization model , described previously in @xcite , is analogous to the one employed to model an hii region ionized by an o star @xcite . in the case of ngc 4051 , following @xcite , the source of ionization",
    "is represented by equation 1 as the superposition of a time - variable power - law component plus a 10@xmath5 k blackbody identified with radiation from an accretion disk , alluded to previously in section 3.1 .",
    "the relative scaling of the two components is designed to mimic the @xmath4 20% decrease in the h@xmath0 emission line luminosity between march , 2000 , when it was observed with _",
    "hst _ and may through july of that same year when it was monitored by @xcite .",
    "the number of ionizing photons per second per unit frequency , @xmath37 , is parameterized , in si units , as    @xmath38    where t = 10@xmath5 k and @xmath39 is planck s constant .    in the _",
    "high_-state , integration of equation 1 from the photoionization threshold of h , @xmath40 , to 3@xmath1 10@xmath41 hz , yields 4.1 @xmath1 10@xmath18 ionizing photons / sec for @xmath42 = 1.77 @xmath1 10@xmath41 w / hz and @xmath0 = 1.17 .",
    "the corresponding values for the _ low_-state are 3.4 @xmath1 10@xmath18 ionizing photons / sec , where @xmath42 = 1.51 @xmath1 10@xmath41 w / hz and @xmath0 = 1.51 . according to this photoionization model , in the _",
    "high_-state the 10@xmath5 k accretion disk provides @xmath4 80% of the ionizing photons with the remaining 20% contributed by the time - variable power - law component .",
    "an appealing attribute of our model is that it explains the observation of @xcite and @xcite that the highly variable _ observable _ x - ray continuum does not contribute significantly to the production of the balmer emission lines .",
    "this is because , in our model , @xmath35 80% of the ionization required by the balmer lines is provided by the hot , @xmath4 20 ev , uv - emitting , accretion disk , which , as noted previously in section 3.1 , is _ hidden from direct view _ by the high opacity of h at these energies .",
    "collectively , in our interpretation , the balmer line emission is produced by a physically large , spherically symmetric , steady state inflow that is photoionized by a much smaller hot , 10@xmath5 k , accretion disk .",
    "such a model guarantees a very high , @xmath4 100% , covering factor for the ionized gas .",
    "our interpretation is very different from the model of @xcite who associate the balmer line emission _ directly _ with a low inclination , i.e. , nearly face - on , accretion disk .",
    "one would expect the ionized region in ngc 4051 to respond to the known x - ray variability and indeed the photoionization model shows that when the agn is in the _ high_-state , the ionization fraction , the electron density and the perceived size of the emitting region all increase compared to when the agn is in a _",
    "these trends are illustrated in figure 5 .",
    "interestingly , the model reveals that the gas is _ always _ completely ionized at the reverberation radius , regardless of which state the agn is in .",
    "the model also reveals that the reverberation radius coincides with a rapid change in the photoionization opacity , @xmath43 .",
    "consequently , we introduce a new definition for the ionization parameter ,    @xmath44    which acknowledges the fact that opacity decreases the flux of ionizing photons with increasing radius , @xmath45 , in the _ large _ , partially ionized , nebula surrounding the agn .",
    "it is significant that this more realistic estimator yields values for @xmath46 that agree with those quoted for the _ warm absorber _ seen in the x - rays @xcite . however , since @xmath46 is predicted to be virtually independent of both radius and the activity state of the agn , the _ warm absorber _ could be located anywhere inside the partially ionized volume .",
    "collectively , the photoionization model reveals that the reverberation radius marks a region of transition as the agn is approached ; from high to low opacity and from partially ionized to completely ionized , with a concurrent decrease in the ionization parameter .",
    "modeling also reveals that the size of the photoionized region depends quite sensitively on the assumed neutral h gas density .",
    "even though the agn in ngc 4051 produces a similar number of ionizing photons to the one in ngc 3227 @xcite , the agn in ngc 4051 is able to ionize a region that is a factor of @xmath4 4  5 larger in radius , a feat that is only possible if the neutral gas density is about one order of magnitude lower in ngc 4051 than in ngc 3227 .",
    "an immediate consequence of the larger ionized volume is a narrow balmer line profile that earned ngc 4051 the nls1 designation . even though the neutral h gas density in the region that the agn ionizes may be low compared to ngc 3227 , the electron density asymptotes to a similarly high value , @xmath11 10@xmath47 @xmath48 , at the reverberation radius .",
    "some physical properties of the inflow for ngc 4051 are presented in table 3 using the prescription described previously in @xcite .",
    "an important result is that the upper limit to the mass inflow rate of ionized gas , corresponding to @xmath49 , is not particularly unusual compared to other llagns , but it is about a factor of 3 less than required to explain the observed 2  10 kev x - ray luminosity of ngc 4051 in terms of radiatively inefficient accretion .    since there is no evidence , nor any reason , to expect the ionizing capabilities or the gas density to be the same for all agns , the outer radius of the ionized region is expected to vary widely from one agn to the next and consequently , the emission line profile shapes to vary from one agn to the next .",
    "this observation highlights the imperative of including the entire balmer emission line , not just the time - variable component , when using broad emission line profiles to infer the _ shape _ and _ size _ of the blr .      in the context of the inflow model ,",
    "the inner radius , synonymous now with the reverberation radius , defines the full width at zero intensity of the broad h@xmath0 emission line as described previously in @xcite .",
    "consequently , the correct virial product for computing the bh mass , at least for ngc 4051 , is    @xmath50    where _ r _ is the reverberation radius ( 3.4 lt - days ) and @xmath51 is the half width at zero intensity ( hwzi ) of the emission line ( 2250 km / s ) . using",
    "these numbers in equation 3 immediately recovers the reverberation bh mass , _",
    "= 1.7 @xmath1 10@xmath30 m@xmath31 , cited by @xcite .",
    "this approach is to be contrasted with the procedure advocated by @xcite in which a virial product resulting from the reverberation radius and the line dispersion , @xmath53 , squared , is multiplied by a factor _ f _ = 5.5 to yield a bh mass according to the relation    @xmath54    the factor of 5.5 is the empirically determined value that scales the virial products to bh masses , _ m@xmath52 _ , so that the latter are on the same _ m@xmath52 _  @xmath55 relation as those measured directly for other galaxies using gas and star kinematics @xcite . in theory",
    ", the parameter , _ f _ , in equation 4 , depends on the kinematic model adopted for the blr gas .",
    "however , the procedure described by @xcite for computing bh masses has evolved in lieu of a specific kinematic model .",
    "the main point we are promoting in this @xmath6 is that the blr gas @xmath56 consistent with a specific kinematic model , namely @xmath57 , leading to a more direct route to computing bh masses using reverberation radii in equation 3 .",
    "high resolution spectroscopy of the llagn in ngc 4051 obtained with _ hst",

    "the inner radius of the region producing the balmer line emission is @xmath4 3 lt - days and consistently coincides with previous measures of the reverberation radius .",
    "the outer radius of the region producing the balmer line emission is at least 475 lt - days .",
    "thus , the reverberation radius measured for ngc 4051 locates just the inner radius of a much larger volume of partially ionized , inflowing , h gas , the full extent of which is unlikely to be revealed by velocity - time mapping .",
