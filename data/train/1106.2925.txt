    "campaigns like ogle , macho or eros were all founded nearly 20 years ago primarily to settle the question whether dark matter resided in the galactic halo in the form of compact objects ( machos ) .",
    "the background theory of the method employing gravitational microlensing was provided by bohdan paczyski @xcite and in subsequent years paczyski himself advocated and supported the creation of large - scale photometric surveys towards the magellanic clouds . the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc )",
    "were considered the best targets for such studies , as with a moderate telescope size the stars of the clouds were easily resolved and hence formed a perfect background for the hunt for microlensing events .",
    "these are unique and temporal brightening events observed on a source background star caused by the gravitational lensing phenomenon in which the lensing object is located in front of the background star .    in the most generic case of a point lens mass and a point source the gravitational amplification of the background light",
    "is described by equation ( after @xcite ) : @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the time of the maximum of the peak , @xmath3 is the einstein radius crossing time ( event time - scale ) and @xmath4 is the event impact parameter .",
    "parameter @xmath3 is the only parameter linked with the physical properties of the source - lens system and is dependent on the lens mass , the lens and source distances and the relative velocity between lens and source .",
    "this means that , in principle , a single microlensing event can not provide any information regarding the lensing object .",
    "additional data are possible only in case of non - standard events , like binary lens / source or those showing a parallax effect .",
    "hence , in studying the mass distribution of lenses , microlensing events are regarded only in groups .",
    "the statistical value related to the total mass enclosed in the volume towards the background sources is the microlensing optical depth , @xmath5 : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the time - span of all observations , @xmath8 is the total number of monitored stars , @xmath9 is the total number of events , each with time - scale @xmath10 and detection efficiency @xmath11 .    in the case of",
    "the magellanic clouds the overall optical depth can be composed with contributions from lenses at various levels .",
    "apart from the hypothetical dark matter compact objects there can also be a contribution to the optical depth from luminous lenses from the disk of our galaxy and from the frontal side of the cloud itself ( i.e.,self - lensing , sl ) .",
    "observations and studies of the pixel - lensing microlensing events towards m31 are still not conclusive with respect to the amount of self - lensing and macho lenses ( see @xcite for recent review ) . however , the most recent analysis of the data tend to be inclined towards self - lensing as being the only explanation of the observed signal @xcite",
    ".    the most recent studies of the data gathered by microlensing surveys towards the lmc suggest the contribution from dark matter compact objects with masses below 10 @xmath12 can be practically ruled out .",
    "the upper limit on macho abundance in the halo was set to 6 - 7 per cent by the eros @xcite and ogle groups @xcite ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "the core of the detected microlensing signal seems to come from the self - lensing events , as suggested already in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the lmc self - lensing effect is relatively well understood thanks to the convenient , almost face - on alignment of the lmc towards us .",
    "the studies by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite showed that the average self - lensing optical depth is in the order of @xmath13 , which is consistent with what was measured in ogle - ii ( @xcite , hereafter paper i ) and ogle - iii data ( @xcite , hereafter paper iii ) .",
    "the situation with the smc is more complicated .",
    "this dwarf galaxy seems to be elongated and is stretched out along the line - of - sight , which produces a much higher self - lensing optical depth .",
    "some estimates by @xcite and @xcite place this value at at least @xmath14 , but it can actually be much higher . microlensing studies of the smc tend to confirm this with their typically higher event rates ( @xcite , @xcite , hereafter paper ii ) , compared with the lmc .    in this paper",
    "we conclude the series of studies of the ogle microlensing data towards the both magellanic clouds with the analysis of the 8 years of observations of the smc in the course of the ogle - iii project .",
    "we attempt to finalise the investigation of the subtle topic of dark matter compact halo objects , providing the result from currently the best and the most suitable data set .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "first , the ogle - iii data used for the analysis are presented .",
    "then , we describe the method applied for finding the microlensing events and its results with a detailed description and study of each found event .",
    "this is followed by a calculation of the optical depth and discussion of the results .",
    "the photometric data used in this study were collected during the third phase of the ogle project ( 2001 - 2009 ) with the 1.3-m warsaw telescope located at las campanas observatory , chile , operated by the carnegie institution of washington .",
    "the `` second generation '' camera comprised eight site @xmath15 ccd detectors with 15  @xmath16 m pixels resulted in 0.26  arcsec / pixel and @xmath17  arcmins total field of view .",
    "the details on the instrumentation setup can be found in @xcite .",
    "the central regions and the outskirts of the smc were covered by 41 fields , giving a total of 14 square degrees .",
    "the map of the fields is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fields ] .",
    "the statistical details of the fields are gathered in table [ tab : fields ] with the following information : the coordinates of their centers , the number of `` good '' template objects in the @xmath18-band , the blending - corrected number of stars ( see section [ sec : blending ] ) and the mean number of all objects visible on a single ccd ( of 8) used for assigning the blending density level .",
    "`` good '' objects are the template objects with at least 80 good data points ( excluding measurements with very large error - bars ) and mean magnitude brighter than @xmath19 mag ( chosen as a mean peak of the observed luminosity functions ) .",
    "the very first observations of the smc within the ogle  iii phase were taken in june 2001 ( jd=@xmath20 ) , except field smc140 ( started in july 2004 ) , and continued until may 2009 ( jd=@xmath21 ) .",
    "most of the observations were taken through the cousins @xmath18-band filter with exposure time 180  s with a mean seeing of 1.36 arcsec . between 583 and 762 measurements",
    "were gathered in each field with an average sampling varying from 2.0 to 3.0 days between subsequent frames ( excluding the gaps between the seasons ) .",
    "the only exception is field smc128 which was observed 1228 times with an average sampling of 1.6 days .",
    "additionally , between 47 and 114 observations per field were obtained in johnson @xmath22-band with integration time 225  s and a mean seeing of 1.39 arcsec .",
    "first @xmath22-band observations were taken in november 2004 ( jd=@xmath23 ) and since then @xmath22 filter frames were taken regularly .",
    "the average sampling frequency in the @xmath22-band was between 4.6 and 10.3 days .",
    "the image reduction pipeline used an image subtraction technique and was based on difference image analysis ( dia ; @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the data used in this work come from the final reductions calibrated to the standard system .",
    "the template images used for subtraction were composed from selected best individual frames resulting in a seeing of around 0.9 arcsec and 1.0 arcsec for i - band and v - band , respectively .",
    "the full description of the reduction techniques , photometric calibration and astrometric transformations can be found in @xcite .",
    "photometric errors produced by the difference imaging process were adjusted as described in paper i by deriving a magnitude dependent correction factor using the constant stars . for each smc field and each filter ( @xmath24 ) we found parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which correct the original error - bar according to the formula : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the original error - bar returned by the dia .",

    "the modelling with mcmc found four equally valid parallax solution covering all possible degeneracies .",
    "their @xmath40 for multi - band data fit , however , differed insignificantly ( @xmath41 , see table [ tab : parallax03 ] ) and were better by @xmath42 than the best non - parallax model with @xmath43 .",
    "we adopted the geocentric formalism to describe the parallax effects ( @xcite , @xcite ) , where we assume the reference system to be located at the earth at the time @xmath44 , which we choose close to the peak of the event .",
    "this ensures that the values of @xmath4 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the parallax model are close to those from non - parallax model .",
    "any deviations of the observer position due to earth motion are calculated against this reference system , which is in rectilinear motion at the velocity of the earth at that time .",
    "the heliocentric velocity of the reference system projected on the plane perpendicular to the line of sight is approximately 29 @xmath45 to south .",
    "usage of the geocentric system helps to find and identify all degenerate solutions .    to find all solutions we investigated the four - fold microlensing degeneracy that is created in case of a single lens with parallax from the two coexisting discrete degeneracies : a two - fold @xmath4 degeneracy @xcite and the jerk - parallax degeneracy @xcite .",
    "these yield four solutions that are presented in figures [ fig : parallax03 ] and [ fig : foursolutions03 ]  fit parameters for solutions 1 though 4 are gathered in table [ tab : parallax03 ] .",
    "pairs of parallax solutions indicate either very close ( solutions 3 & 4 ) or a bit more distant lens ( solutions 1 & 2 ) .",
    "the former would yield a distance to the lens of order of 100 pc for a typical mass of the lens @xmath46  it is extremely unlikely for the potential lens to be located so close to the observer . on the other hand , the latter set of solutions have parallax scale of @xmath47 .",
    "this yields distance @xmath48 for a typical mass , and since it covers significantly more volume in the galaxy and many more potential lenses we choose these as preferred solutions .",
    "the detection of the parallax signal in this event implies that the lens most probably comes from the galactic thick disk population of stars .",
    "assuming the microlensing source to be at the distance of the smc , as suggested by the cmd location of the source , we can neglect source motion and calculate lens velocity projected on the earth plane to be @xmath49 @xmath50 50 @xmath45 .",
    "this , when taking into account the angle of the relative lens motion and the velocity of the geocentric reference system , leads to heliocentric lens velocity , projected on the plane of the observer , to be approximately @xmath51 @xmath45 in north and east direction , respectively .",
    "since the lens is much closer than the source we can neglect the effect of projection and note that the true heliocentric velocity of the lens will be of the same order .",
    "this type of kinematics is not surprising for the thick disk object .    because there is no blend visible we can derive an upper limit on the lens brightness equal to around 21.5 mag in @xmath18-band .",
    "this limit is met by a late m dwarf ( with mass @xmath52 ) at the distance of more than @xmath53 kpc , and an early m dwarf ( with mass @xmath54 ) at the distance of more than @xmath55 kpc .",
    "although we can not rule out the lens to be a dark object in the galactic halo the lens as a disk star is a much more natural explanation .",
    "@xcite showed in their simulation of the microlensing rate towards the lmc that the contribution of the galactic disc lenses to the overall microlensing rate is comparable to the contribution from the lmc self - lensing .",
    "it means that in our searches for microlensing events towards magellanic clouds we should expect some of them to be caused by galactic lenses .",
    "we can conclude that the most likely scenario for ogle - smc-03 is that the lens is an m dwarf with mass of about 0.1 - 0.3 @xmath12 located 1 - 5 kpc from the earth and belonging to the thick disk of the galaxy , similar to the event macho - lmc-5 , e.g. @xcite , @xcite and event eros2-lmc-8 @xcite .    with velocity of the order of 80 @xmath45 and location a few kpc from the earth",
    ", the lens should have a noticeable proper motion of a few @xmath56 and therefore should be resolvable with the _ hst _ in a couple of years .",
    "this would give a good opportunity to confirm the nature of this event .",
    "this event was not previously detected neither by ews ( it occurred in the end of 2002 in the early season of the ogle - iii when the ews was not yet operating ) , nor by any other surveys .",
    "its light curve is relatively well covered by ogle - iii @xmath18-band data , but there are no observations taken during the event in @xmath22-band .",
    "the event was present in the eros2 database , however only in their @xmath57-band .",
    "therefore we performed a multi - band fit using ogle @xmath18-band and eros @xmath57-band data , which resulted in instrumental colour of the source of @xmath58 .",
    "this was then transformed to standard ogle s @xmath59 following @xcite and yielded @xmath60 .",
    "the error - bar includes the systematic error from the transformation .",
    "the position of the source on the cmd ( fig.[fig : cmd ] ) indicates it belongs to the red clump giant population of the smc .",
    "the time - scale of the event is relatively short ( @xmath61 ) , which favours a self - lensing ( sl ) scenario . unless the lens is nearby ( @xmath6220 kpc ) , a typical time - scale of halo lensing events with masses around 0.4 @xmath12 and sources in the smc are well above 20 days . in sl",
    "the time - scales are usually a few times shorter owing to much larger projected velocity , @xmath63 2000 km / s , compared to @xmath64 200 km / s for halo lenses @xcite .",

    "another possibility if that the lens is a thick disk red dwarf given the fact the blending object must be redder that the red clump of the smc .",
    "high - resolution imaging could potentially reveal the actual lens as the event happened already almost 10 years ago giving enough time for lens and source to separate .",

    "[ fig : blending ] . we were also able to calculate a mean ratio between the number of real stars to all objects composed of these stars .",

    "at hand we were able to perform the detection efficiency determination .",
    "for selected fields representing different density levels and for time - scales in range between 1 and 1000 days we simulated numerous microlensing events with the parameters being drawn from realistic distributions . for the lensed flux we used the measurements of randomly selected star from the simulated field , which during the event was split between blend and source according to the blending parameter .",
    "this procedure also preserved any variability of the underlying flux , allowing for events with variable baseline ( see e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "the efficiency curves for representative dense and sparse fields and for the all stars and bright stars samples are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eff ] . the detection efficiencies do not change much with the density of the field due to relatively low gradient in the stellar density in the ogle - iii smc fields .",
    "the calculated efficiency is somewhat lower when compared with the one obtained for ogle - iii lmc data , mainly because here we used a different magnitude cut on star selection for the all stars sample ( 21.0 mag , compared with 20.4 mag for the lmc ) .",
    "having the three events and their time - scales as well as the detection efficiency of each of them we are able to calculate the average optical depth towards the smc based on ogle - iii data . in order to evaluate eq .",
    "[ eq : tau ] we also need the estimated number of total monitored stars , derived in the previous section , and the total time of observation , @xmath7=2870 days .    first , we calculated the optical depth for the all stars sample ( @xmath68 , down to @xmath18=21 mag ) using the detection efficiencies obtained in our simulations .",
    "because our simulations utilised @xmath18-band data solely we used @xmath69 obtained in 5-parameter fit for all three events .",

    "however , still the most difficult question to answer is where these events originated from . in principle , because standard microlensing model can not tell us where the source and the lens are located , there are a number of different combinations possible , including the smc , the halo of the milky way and the disk of the milky way . in the history of the magellanic clouds microlensing",
    "there were already examples of confirmed cases of each of the combinations , e.g.,source and lens from the smc @xcite , disk lens towards the lmc @xcite .    in the case of our events , the new one , ogle - smc-04",
    ", is probably the best candidate for self - lensing event given its time - scale and location in the red clump stars of the smc , however , we can not exclude the thick disk red dwarf scenario or macho . the parallax effect detected in the event ogle - smc-03 help",
    "constrain the lens to most likely be a typical m - dwarf star from the galactic disk , however a dark lens can not be entirely ruled out .",
    "finally , even though ogle - smc-02 is the likely to be a halo lens , @xcite , who modelled it in detail , did not exclude the self - lensing option completely .",
    "the effect of self - lensing for the smc is not yet well understood . however , due to the alignment of the smc along the line - of - sight the contribution of sl to @xmath5 is expected to be higher than in the face - on lmc and be at least 1.0@xmath82 , in average ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this is in good agreement with the value of the optical depth we measured for all three events found in the ogle - iii data .",
    "therefore , we expect the signal from the self - lensing or , more generally , the background of lensing by known stellar populations , is close to what we have detected .",
    "however , because the nature of our events is not yet firmly confirmed we can derive an upper limit on dark matter compact halo objects , following @xcite , @xcite and papers i , ii and iii .    assuming the machos mass distribution function from model `` s '' from @xcite and using the mean detection efficiency for our smc fields we derived the number of expected events due to machos as a function of their mass .",
    "the mass in such events can be approximately translated to a time - scale as @xmath83 . the number of expected events compared with the observed ( or not observed ) signal can be converted to an upper limit on the macho s halo mass fraction using enhanced poisson statistics with background signal @xcite .",
    "the derived upper limit for ogle - iii smc data is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : taulimitsmc ] and was calculated assuming we expect about 3 events from the self - lensing / background . for a `` typical '' macho with mass of 0.4 @xmath12",
    "the fraction is less than 37 per cent , but for lower masses , between 0.01 and 0.1 @xmath12 it is below 20 per cent .",
    "figure [ fig : taulimitsmc ] shows also an upper limit on machos derived by eros @xcite and macho signal claimed by the macho group at 95 per cent confidence . for the latter we show both the original value from @xcite ( for @xmath84 ) for all macho events being due to machos and the value corrected following the rejection of one of the original macho events ( macho - lmc-7 , see paper iii ) . for the corrected value ,",
    "the macho fraction in the halo becomes 18 per cent , compared to the original 20 per cent .",
    "if the background lensing ( galactic disk and lmc self - lensing ) was extracted from the macho signal ( at a conservative level suggested in @xcite of @xmath85 ) and the compromised event was rejected , the macho group data can be interpreted that only about 14 per cent of machos may compose the galactic halo .",
    "we can obtain a much tighter limit from ogle by combining all ogle - ii and ogle - iii results for both large and small magellanic clouds .",
    "for each set of data we computed the expected number of events for a given mass of the deflector and combined it with about 8 events expected to be due to the background lensing populations .",
    "it yielded @xmath86 ( at 95 per cent c.l . ) for masses around 0.4 @xmath12 and reached the minimum of @xmath87 at mass range between 0.01 and 0.15 @xmath12 .",
    "figure [ fig : taulimit ] shows the combined ogle limit along with the corrected macho group signal and eros upper limit with the both axes zoomed in at the intersection of results from all surveys .",
    "this result , therefore , pushes the upper limit on macho mass fraction in the halo down to a value similar to the one derived by eros .",
    "the ogle result is a somewhat more sensitive to machos in the higher mass regime ( between 1 and 10 @xmath12 ) , and is significantly less sensitive for masses below 0.01 @xmath12 .",
    "when looking at all events in more detail , in the most likely case , we can safely attribute to non - macho lensing ( self - lensing or disk lensing ) all the events detected in the lmc and smc during ogle - ii and ogle - iii except ogle - smc-02 .",
    "in such case , the optical depth due to this single dark matter event would be @xmath88 .",
    "if the mw halo were composed only from such lenses with mass of around 10 @xmath12 , such an optical depth would mean they contribute no more than 2 per cent of the total mass of the dark halo .",
    "this is in agreement with the expected mass fraction of black - holes in the total mass budget of the galaxy varying from around 5 per cent @xcite for all massive stellar remnants to 0.4 per cent for a standard initial mass function ( e.g.,@xcite ) integrated above 6 @xmath12 .",
    "it is also a much tighter limit than the limit of 40 per cent derived by the macho group on objects below 30 @xmath12 @xcite , obtained based on a lack of long - term events .",
    "the value obtained for a single microlensing event , however , is only crudely estimated , and should be assessed more elaborately , e.g.,with simulations of long events in the ogle - ii and ogle - iii data combined . in practice , more events with long time - scales are needed in order to put better and more statistically sound constraints on the massive stellar remnants abundance in the halo",
    ". continued observations of the magellanic clouds by moa and ogle - iv surveys will hopefully yield more potential black - hole events residing in the halo if they are common enough .",
    "we analysed ogle - iii data covering the small magellanic cloud and found three convincing candidates for microlensing events , among which one was not known before ( ogle - smc-04 ) .",
    "two of the events are likely to be caused by self - lensing or have lenses located in the galactic disk .",
    "ogle - smc-03 is actually the first event towards the small magellanic cloud exhibiting clear parallax signal , which makes the lens likely to be in the thick disk .",
    "the third one ( ogle - smc-02 ) is a potential candidate for a binary black hole lens from the halo , but its self - lensing origin can not be totally excluded .    following a detailed analysis of the blending in the smc we derived the optical depth for the all stars sample of @xmath89 , which is in agreement with expected self - lensing signal towards the smc .",
    "the upper limit on the dark matter in form of machos derived for the ogle - iii smc data alone was about 20 per cent for masses below 0.1 @xmath12 .    in this paper",
    "we concluded the studies of the microlensing searches conducted so far by the ogle project towards the magellanic clouds .",
    "we presented the final result combining all available data and deriving new constraints on the fraction of massive compact halo objects in the galactic halo of 6 per cent for @xmath90 and below 4 per cent for lower masses .",
    "for machos with mass of 1 @xmath12 and 20 @xmath12 the upper limits are @xmath91 and @xmath92 per cent , respectively .",
    "13 years of ogle observations indicate the macho halo fraction is well below the value suggested by macho group ( 14 per cent after correction due to rejection of one of their events owing to a second bump for the same events found in the ogle data ) and in agreement with the limit derived by eros survey .",
    "our result indicates that baryonic dark matter in the form of relics of stars and very faint objects in the sub - solar mass regime is unlikely to inhabit the milky way s dark matter halo in any significant numbers .",
    "the presence of the black hole lens candidate towards the smc agrees with the expected @xmath93 per cent contribution of black holes to the mass of the galactic halo .    with the ogle project",
    "now in its fourth phase we hope the sensitivity to extremely long events will improve significantly within the next years when combined with the historic ogle data .",
    "long duration events will also be easily detectable in near - real - time by gaia satellite , due to launch in 2013 .",
    "detailed follow - up observations of the alerts triggered by ogle and gaia will be crucial for revealing the true nature of detected events .",
    "this should result in an increase in the number of potential black - hole lenses or allow us to rule out heavy dark matter compact objects as well and close that topic definitively .",
