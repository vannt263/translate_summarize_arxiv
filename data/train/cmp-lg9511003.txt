    "agents may engage in conversation for a range of reasons , e.g. to acquire information , to establish a contract , to make a plan , or to be social . at each point in a dialogue",
    ", agents must make communicative choices about what to say and how and when to say it .",
    "this paper focuses on agents communicative choice in collaborative planning dialogues , dialogues whose purpose is to discuss and agree on a plan for future action , and potentially execute that plan .",
    "i will argue that agents choices in communicative action , their algorithms for language behavior , must be determined with respect to two relatively unexplored factors in models of collaborative planning dialogues : ( 1 ) agents resource limits , such as limits in attentional and inferential capacity ; and ( 2 ) features of collaborative planning tasks that affect task difficulty , such as inferential complexity , the degree of belief coordination required , and tolerance for errors .",
    "a primary dimension of communicative choice is the degree of explicitness .",
    "for example , consider a simple task of agent a and agent b trying to agree on a plan for furnishing a two room house .",
    "imagine that a wants b to believe the proposition realized by and believes that b can infer this from the propositions realized in : and are abstractions from naturally occurring examples in which the propositions realized here are realized in a number of different ways . here",
    "the focus is on the logical relationships between the contents of each proposition : a and b are minor premises and c is the major premise for the inference under discussion . ]    in naturally - occurring dialogues , a may produce utterances realizing the propositions in to , or other variations @xcite .",
    "the communicative choices in through illustrate a general fact : for any communicative act , the same effect can be achieved with a range of acts at various levels of explicitness .",
    "this raises a key issue : on what basis does a choose among the more or less explicit versions of the proposal in 3 to 6 ?",
    "the single constraint that has been suggested elsewhere in the literature is the redundancy constraint : a should not say information that b already knows , or that b could infer .",
    "the redundancy constraint appears in the form of simple dictums such as ` do nt tell people what they already know ' , as grice s quantity maxim do not make your contribution more informative than is required@xcite and as constraints on planning operators for the generation and recognition of communicative plans@xcite .",
    "so , if we assume that b knows b and c , then the only possibility for what a can say is .",
    "the redundancy constraint is based on the assumption that agent a should leave implicit any information she believes that b already knows or she believes that b could infer , in other words , that agent b can always ` fill in what is missing ' by a combination of retrieving facts from memory and making inferences . in section [ iru - sec ]",
    ", i will show that agents in natural dialogues consistently violate the redundancy constraint .",
    "i will argue that this should not be particularly surprising since the redundancy constraint is based on several simplifying assumptions :    1 .",
    "unlimited working - memory assumption : everything an agent knows is always available for reasoning ; 2 .",
    "logical omniscience assumption : agents are logically omniscient ; 3 .",
    "fewest utterances assumption : utterance production is the only process that should be minimized ; 4 .",
    "no autonomy assumption : assertions and proposals by agent a are accepted by default by agent b.    when agents are autonomous and resource - limited , these assumptions do not always hold , and the problem of communicative choice remains .    the plan for the paper is as follows : section [ iru - sec ] motivates a number of hypotheses about the relationship of communicative choice , resource limits and task features using evidence from natural collaborative planning dialogues .",
    "these hypotheses are the basis of a model of collaborative planning presented in section [ model - sec ]",
    ". then section [ dw - sec ] describes how the model is implemented in a testbed for collaborative planning dialogues called design - world , which supports experiments on the interaction of agents communicative choice , resource limits , and features of the task . at this point , in section [ method - sec ]",
    ", i review the steps of the method applied so far , and motivate the use of simulation as a method for testing the hypotheses .",
    "section [ results - sec ] presents the experimental results and discusses the extent to which the hypotheses were confirmed , and then section [ discussion - sec ] discusses the theoretical implications of these results and the extent to which they can be generalized to other tasks , agent properties , and communication strategies .",
    "naturally occurring collaborative planning dialogues are design , problem solving , diagnostic or advice - giving dialogues@xcite . in order to generate hypotheses about the relation of communicative choice to agent properties and task features ,",
    "this section examines communicative choice in naturally occurring collaborative planning dialogues .",
    "most of the examples discussed below are excerpts from a corpus of dialogues from a radio talk show for financial planning advice @xcite , but i will also draw on data from collaborative design , collaborative construction , and computer support dialogues @xcite .",
    "dialogue , in general , is modeled as a process by which conversants add to what is assumed to be already mutually believed or intended .",
    "this set of assumed mutual beliefs and intentions is called the discourse model , or the common ground@xcite . in collaborative planning dialogues ,",
    "the conversants are attempting to add mutual beliefs about the current state of the world and mutual beliefs and intentions about a plan for future action to the discourse model .",
    "it is obvious that the efficacy of the final plan and the efficiency of the planning process must be affected by agents algorithms for communicative choice .",
    "however previous work has not systematically varied factors that affect communicative choice , such as resource limits and task complexity .",
    "furthermore , most previous work has been based on the redundancy constraint , and apparently , its concomitant simplifying assumptions ( but see @xcite ) .    to explore the relation of communicative choice to effective collaborative planning",
    ", the analysis of naturally occurring collaborative planning dialogues in this paper focuses on communicative acts that violate the redundancy constraint .",
    "these acts are informationally redundant utterances , irus , defined as :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * definition of informational redundancy * + an utterance @xmath0 is informationally redundant in a discourse situation @xmath1    1 .",
    "if @xmath0 expresses a proposition @xmath2 , and another utterance @xmath3 that entails @xmath2 has already been said in @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath0 expresses a proposition @xmath2 , and another utterance @xmath3 that presupposes or implicates @xmath2 has already been said in @xmath1 . _",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    [ iru - def ]    a statistical analysis of the financial advice corpus showed that about 12 % of the utterances are irus .",
    "as mentioned in section [ intro - sec ] , this should not be particularly surprising since the definition of irus reflects several simplifying assumptions .",
    "for example , the definition reflects the logical omniscience assumption because it assumes that all the entailments of propositions uttered in a discourse and certain default inferences from propositions uttered in a discourse become part of the discourse model .",
    "the definition reflects the no autonomy assumption because it assumes that merely saying an utterance u@xmath4 that expresses a proposition p@xmath5 is sufficient for adding p@xmath5 to the discourse model .",
    "the fact that irus occur shows that the simplifying assumptions are not valid .",
    "the distributional analysis suggests that there are at least 3 functional categories of irus :    * communicative functions of irus * : +    * attitude : to provide evidence supporting beliefs about mutual understanding and acceptance * attention : to manipulate the locus of attention of the discourse participants by making a proposition salient . *",
    "consequence : to augment the evidence supporting beliefs that certain inferences are licensed    irus have antecedents in the dialogue which are the utterances that originally realized the content of the iru either through direct assertion or by an inferential chain ; in the definition above @xmath3 is an antecedent for @xmath0 .",
    "the 3 communicative functions of irus were identified by correlations with distributional features based in part on relations between the iru and its antecedent , such as textual distance , discourse structure relations , and logical relations .",
    "the distributional analysis also analyzed utterance features such as the intonational realization of the iru , the form of the iru , and the relation of the iru to adjacent utterances .",
    "below , i will briefly give examples of each type of iru .",
    "for each type i will explain how the four simplifying assumptions of previous dialogue models predict that the utterance is informationally redundant",
    ". then we will consider hypothetical agent and task properties under which irus function as hypothesized above .",
    "attitude irus provide evidence supporting beliefs about mutual understanding and acceptance by demonstrating the speaker s attitude to an assertion or proposal made by another agent in dialogue .",
    "an attitude iru , said with a falling intonation typical of a declarative utterance , is given in -27 , where m repeats what h has asserted in -26 .",
    "m and h have been discussing how m and her husband can handle funds invested in iras ( individual retirement accounts ) . in , and in the other naturally occurring examples below , the antecedents of the irus are _ italicized _ and the irus are in caps .",
    "the iru in 27 provides direct evidence that m heard exactly what h said @xcite .",
    "according to arguments elaborated below and elsewhere @xcite , m s response indirectly provides evidence that she accepts and therefore believes what h has asserted .

    "the parameters support modeling various instantiations of the agent architecture given in figure [ irma - fig ] .",
    "for example , varying the cost of retrieval models different assumptions about how the beliefs database , plan library and working memory are implemented .",
    "varying the cost of communication models situations in which communication planning is very costly .",
    "the relation between the values of these parameters and the utilities of the steps in the plan determines experimental outcomes , rather than the absolute values .    as an example of the effect of varying these costs ,",
    "consider the plots of performance distributions shown in figures [ baseline - fig ] and [ retcost - baseline - fig ] for low , mid and high awm . in these figures ,",
    "performance is plotted on the x - axis and number of simulations at that performance level are given by bars on the y - axis .",
    "the performance distributions in figure [ baseline - fig ] demonstrate the increase in quality of solution that we would expect with increases in awm , given no processing costs .",
    "figure [ retcost - baseline - fig ] shows what happens when processing is not free : here a retrieval cost of .001 means that every memory access reduces quality of solution by 1/1000 of a point ( remember that the utilities of plan steps range between 10 and 56 ) . as figure [ retcost - baseline - fig ] shows , the ability to access the whole beliefs database in reasoning does not always improve performance since high awm agents perform similarly to mid awm agents .",
    "section [ iru - sec ] proposed hypotheses about the function of irus in human to human collaborative planning dialogues , and then section [ model - sec ] presented a model for collaborative planning dialogues based on the observations in section [ iru - sec ] . section [ dw - sec ] then described design - world as a testbed of the model , and sections [ task - def - sec ] and [ comm - choice - sec ] introduced a number of parameters of the testbed that are intended to model the features of the human - human dialogues and support testing of the hypotheses . here",
    "i wish to summarize the mapping between the naturally occurring dialogues and the design of the testbed in order to clarify the basis for the experiments in the next section .",
    "the testbed and the experimental parameters are based on the following mapping between human - human collaborative planning dialogues and the testbed . first , the planning and deliberation aspects of human processing are modeled with the irma architecture , and resource limits on these processes are modeled by extending the irma architecture with a model of attention / working memory ( awm ) which has been shown to model a limited but critical set of properties of human processing .",
    "second , the processing of dialogue is tied to the agent architecture .",
    "third , the mapping of a warrant relation between an act and a belief in naturally occurring examples such as [ walnut - examp ] is modeled with a warrant relation between an act and a belief in design - world as seen in the explicit - warrant communication strategy in section [ comm - choice - sec ] .",
    "fourth , the mapping assumes that arbitrary content based inferences in natural dialogues such as that discussed in relation to example [ certif - examp ] can be mapped to content based inferences in design - world such as those required for doing well on the matched - pair tasks .",
    "fifth , the mapping is based on the assumption that task difficulty in naturally occurring tasks such as those in the financial advice domain can be related to three abstract features : ( 1 ) inferential complexity as measured by the number of premise required for making an inferences ; ( 2 ) degree of belief coordination required on intentions , inferences and beliefs underlying a plan ; and ( 3 ) task determinacy and fault tolerance .",
    "finally the mapping assumes that it is reasonable to evaluate the performance of the agents in collaborative planning dialogues by using domain plan utility for a measure of the quality of solution and defining the cost to achieve that solution as collaborative effort , appropriately parameterized .",
    "the details of this mapping specifies how the testbed implements the model of collaborative planning and provides the basis for extrapolating from the testbed experimental results to the human - human dialogues that are being modeled .",
    "the testbed provides an excellent environment for testing the hypotheses to the extent that the model captures critical aspects of human - human dialogues .",
    "the experiments examine the interaction between tasks , communication strategies and awm resource limits .",
    "every experiment varies awm over three ranges : low , mid , and high . in order to run an experiment on a particular communicative strategy for a particular task ,",
    "200 dialogues for each awm range are simulated .",
    "because the awm model is probabilistic , each dialogue simulation has a different result .",
    "the awm parameter yields a performance distribution for very resource limited agents ( low ) , agents hypothesized to be similar to human agents ( mid ) , and resource unlimited agents ( high ) .",
    "sample performance distributions for quality of solution ( with no collaborative effort subtracted ) from runs of two all - implicit agents for each awm setting are shown in figure [ bill - kim - hist - fig ] .    to test our hypotheses ,",
    "we want to * compare * the performance of two different communicative strategies for a particular task , under different asssumptions about resource limits and processing costs . to see the effect of communicative strategy and awm over the whole range of awm settings ,",
    "we first run a two - way analysis of variance ( anova ) with awm as one factor and communication strategy as another .",
    "the anova tells us whether : ( 1 ) awm alone is a significant factor in predicting performance ; ( 2 ) communication strategy alone is a significant factor in predicting performance ; and ( 3 ) whether there is an interaction between communication strategy and awm .    however , anova alone does not enable us to determine the particular awm range at which a communication strategy aids or hinders performance , and many of the hypotheses about the benefits of particular communication strategies are specific to how resource limited an agent is .",
    "furthermore , whenever strategy affects performance positively for one value of awm and negatively for another value of awm , the potential effects of strategy can not be seen from the anova alone . therefore , we conduct planned comparisons of strategies using the modified bonferroni test ( hereafter mb ) @xcite , within each awm range setting to determine which awm range the strategy affects @xcite . .05 , 5.06 for a p @xmath6 .025 , 6.66 for a p @xmath6 .01 , and 9.61 for a p @xmath6 .002 . ] on the basis of these comparisons we can say whether a strategy is beneficial for a particular task for a particular awm range .    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ a strategy a is beneficial as compared to a strategy b , for a particular awm range , in the same task situation , with the same cost settings , if the mean of a is significantly greater than the mean of b , according to the modified bonferroni test ( mb ) test .",

    "may be both beneficial and detrimental depending on the range of awm that the two strategies are compared over , i.e. a strategy may be beneficial for low awm agents and detrimental for high awm agents .",
    "a difference plot such as that in figure [ free - ret - iei - fig ] is used to summarize a comparison of two strategies , strategy 1 and strategy 2 . in the comparisons below",
    ", strategy 1 is either close - consequence , .",
    "since only one agent will ever produce a closing statement for any dialogue segment , only one agent is given the option in the simulations .",
    "] explicit - warrant , or matched - pair - inference - explicit and strategy 2 is the all - implicit strategy .",
    "* differences * in performance means between two strategies are plotted on the y - axis against awm ranges on the x - axis .",
    "each point in the plot represents the difference in the means of 200 runs of each strategy at a particular awm range .",
    "these plots summarize the information from 1200 simulated dialogues .",
    "remember that the standard task is defined so that the quality of solution that agents achieve for a design - house plan , constructed via the dialogue , is the sum of the utilities of each valid step in their plan .",
    "the task has multiple correct solutions and is fault tolerant because the point values for invalid steps in the plan are simply subtracted from the score , with the effect that agents are not heavily penalized for making mistakes .",
    "furthermore , the task has low inferential complexity : the only inferences agents are required to make are those for deliberation and means - end reasoning . in both of these cases , to make these inferences , agents are only required to access a single minor premise    all - implicit agents do fairly well at the standard task , under assumptions that all processing is free , as shown in the performance plot in figure [ baseline - fig ] . however , as retrieval costs increase , high awm agents do nt do as well as when retrieval is free , because they expend too much effort on retrieval during collaborative planning .",
    "compare the high awm distribution in figure [ baseline - fig ] with that in figure [ retcost - baseline - fig ] .",
    "thus for the standard task , high awm agents have the potential to benefit from communication strategies that reduce the total effort for retrieval , when retrieval is not free .",
    "in addition , although the task has minimal inferential complexity , easy access to information that is used for deliberation , which the explicit - warrant strategy provides , could benefit low awm agents , since they might otherwise make nonoptimal decisions . furthermore , although the task is fault tolerant , agents are still penalized for making errors since errors do not contribute to performance .",
    "thus for the standard task , communication strategies such as close - consequence that can reduce the number of errors could be beneficial .",
    "below we will compare the all - implicit strategy to the explicit - warrant strategy and the close - consequence strategy .",
    "[ [ explicit - warrant-1 ] ] explicit - warrant + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the explicit - warrant strategy can be used in the standard task to test hypothesis a1 : agents produce attention irus to support the processes of deliberating beliefs and intentions .",
    "it can also be used to test hypothesis a4 : the choice to produce an attention iru is related to the degree to which an agent is resource limited in attentional capacity .",
    "thus one prediction is that the explicit - warrant strategy will result in higher performance for low awm agents even when processing is free by ensuring that they can access the warrant and use it in deliberation , thus making better decisions .",
    "figure [ free - ret - iei - fig ] plots the differences in the performance means between the explicit - warrant strategy and the all - implicit strategy for low , mid and high awm agents .",

    "however , there is an interaction between awm and communicative choice ( f=1136.34 , p@xmath6 .000001 ) .    by comparing performance within a particular awm range for each strategy we can see which awm settings interact with communicative strategy .",
    "the planned comparisons using the modified bonferonni ( mb ) test show that the explicit - warrant strategy is neither beneficial nor detrimental in the standard task , in comparison with the all - implicit strategy , if all processing is free ( mb(low ) = 0.29 , ns ; mb(mid ) = 2.79 , ns ; mb(high ) = 0.39 , ns ) .",
    "note that there is a trend towards the explicit - warrant strategy being detrimental at mid awm .",
    "the hypothesis based on the corpus analysis was that low awm agents might benefit from communicative strategies that include irus .",
    "however , this hypothesis is disconfirmed .",
    "further analysis of this result suggests a hypothesis not apparent from the corpus analysis : any beneficial effect of an iru can be cancelled for resource limited agents because irus may displace other information from working memory that is more useful . in this case , despite the fact that the warrant information is useful for deliberation , making the warrant salient displaces information that can be used to generate other options .",
    "when agents are very resource - limited making an optimal decision is not as important as being able to generate multiple options .",
    "the explicit - warrant strategy can also be used in the standard task to test hypothesis i1 : strategies that reduce collaborative effort overall may be beneficial .",

    "the model of collaborative planning dialogues presented in section [ model - sec ] draws from previous work on cooperative dialogue @xcite , and the results are applicable to other current research on collaborative planning @xcite .    the agent architecture and",
    "the model of deliberation and means - end reasoning is based on the work of @xcite and @xcite , and on pollack s tileworld simulation environment @xcite .",
    "the use of irma as an underlying model of intention deliberation to provide a basis for a collaborative planning model was first proposed in @xcite , and has been incorporated into other work @xcite .",
    "the architecture includes a specific model of limited working memory , but most of the claims about the model are based on its recency and frequency properties , which might also be provided by other cognitively based architectures such as soar@xcite . since the testbed architecture is consistent with that assumed in other work , the experimental results should be generalizable to those frameworks .",
    "the relationship between discourse acts and domain - based options and intentions in this work is based on litman s model of discourse plans @xcite and is similar to the approach in @xcite .",
    "the emphasis on autonomy at each stage of the planning process and the belief reasoning mechanism of design - world agents is based on the theory of belief revision and the multi - agent simulation environment developed in the automated librarian project @xcite .",
    "the design - world testbed is based on the methods used in the tileworld and phoenix simulation environments : rapidly changing robot worlds in which an artificial agent attempts to optimize reasoning and planning @xcite .",
    "tileworld is a single agent world in which the agent interacts with its environment , rather than with another agent .",
    "design - world uses similar methods to test a theory of the effect of resource limits on communicative behavior between two agents .",
    "design - world is also based on the method used in carletta s jam simulation for the edinburgh map - task @xcite .",
    "jam is based on the map - task dialogue corpus , where the goal of the task is for the planning agent , the instructor , to instruct the reactive agent , the instructee , how to get from one place to another on the map .",
    "jam focuses on efficient strategies for recovery from error and parametrizes agents according to their communicative and error recovery strategies .",
    "given good error recovery strategies , carletta argues that ` high risk ' communicative strategies are more efficient , but did not attempt to quantify efficiency .",
    "in contrast , the approach here provides a way of quantifying what is an effective or efficient strategy , and the results suggest that a combination of the agents resource limitations and the task definition determine when strategies are efficient . future work could test carletta s claims about recovery strategies within this extended framework .    to my knowledge",
    ", none of this earlier work has considered the factors that affect the range of variation in communicative choice , or the effects of different choices , or measured how communicative choice affects the construction of a collaborative plan and the ability of the conversants to stay coordinated . nor have other theories of collaborative planning been explicit about the agent architecture , or tested specific ideas about resource bounds in dialogue , and none have used utility as the basis for agents communicative choice . in addition , no earlier work on cooperative task - oriented dialogue argued that conversational agents resource limits and task complexity are major factors in determining effective conversational strategies in collaboration .      a promising avenue for future work is to investigate beneficial strategies for teams of heterogeneous agents .",
    "in the experiments here , pairs of agents in dialogue were always parameterized with the same resource limits .",
    "pilot studies of dialogues between heterogeneous agents suggest that strategies that are not effective for homogeneous agents may be effective for heterogeneous ones .",
    "for example , in @xcite i tested an attention iru strategy in which agents would tell one another about all the options they knew about at the beginning of planning each room .",
    "this strategy is not beneficial for homogeneous agents because irus can displace other useful information .",
    "however if one agent is not limited , then it can be helpful for the resource limited agent to exploit the capabilities of the more capable agent by telling the other agent important facts before it forgets them .",
    "another extension would be to extend the agent communication strategies or to test additional ones .",
    "for example , other work proposes a number of strategies for information selection and ordering in dialogue and provides some evidence that these strategies are efficient or efficacious @xcite .",
    "support for these claims could be provided by design - world experiments in which agents used these strategies to communicate .",
    "future work could also modify the properties of the world or of the task .",
    "for example , it would be possible to make design - world more like tileworld by making the world change in the course of the task , by adding or removing furniture .",
    "these results may also be incorporated as input into decision algorithms in which agents decide online which strategy to pursue , and investigate additional factors that determine when strategies are effective in collaborative planning dialogues .",
    "the results presented here show what information an agent should consider .",
    "for example , a comparison between low , mid and high awm agents shows how to design decision algorithms for agents who have to decide whether to expend additional effort .",
    "another promising avenue is make the agents capable of remembering and learning from past mistakes so that they can adapt their strategies to the situation @xcite .",
    "finally , these results should be incorporated into the design of multi - agent problem - solving systems and into systems for human - computer communication , such as those for teaching , advice and explanation , where for example the use of particular strategies might be premised on the abilities of the learner or apprentice .",
    "the goal of this paper was to show how agents choice in communicative action , their algorithms for language behavior , can be designed to mitigate the effect of their resource limits in the context of particular features of a collaborative planning task . in this paper ,",
    "i first motivate a number of hypotheses based on a statistical analysis of natural collaborative planning dialogues .",
    "then a functional model of collaborative planning dialogues is developed based on these hypotheses , including parameters that are hypothesized to affect the generalizability of the model .",
    "the model is then implemented in a testbed in which these parameters can be varied , and the hypotheses are tested .",
    "the method used here can be contrasted with other work on dialogue modeling .",
    "much previous work on dialogue modeling only carries out part of the process described above : only the initial part of the process up to specifying a functional model is completed .",
    "followon research that is based on these models must judge the model according to subjective criteria such as how well it fits researcher s intuitions or how elegant the model is .",
    "the models developed here on the basis of empirical evidence can also be judged according to these subjective criteria , but this work carries out additional steps to further test and refine the model suggested by the corpus analysis . implementing a model with parameters to test the generalizability of the model and testing hypotheses in a testbed implementation provides a way to check subjective evaluations and suggests many ways in which our initial hypotheses must be refined and further tested .",
    "the design - world testbed is the first testbed for conversational systems that systematically introduces several different types of independent parameters that are hypothesized to affect the efficacy of a collaborative plan negotiated through a dialogue , and the efficiency of that dialogue process .",
    "experiments in the testbed examined the interaction between ( 1 ) agents resource limits in attentional capacity and inferential capacity ; ( 2 ) agents choice in communication ; and ( 3 ) features of communicative tasks that affect task difficulty such as inferential complexity , degree of belief coordination required , and tolerance for errors .",
    "the results verified a number of hypotheses that depended on particular assumptions about agents resource limits that were not possible to test by corpus analysis alone .",
    "several unpredicted and counterintuitive results were also demonstrated by the experiments .",
    "first , the task property of belief coordination in * combination * with resource limits ( as in the zero - nonmatching - beliefs and matched - pair tasks ) , were shown to produce the most robust benefits for irus , rather than resource limits alone as originally hypothesized .",
    "second , i predicted that irus would always be beneficial for low awm agents , but found that irus can be detrimental for these agents through a side effect of displacing other , more useful , beliefs from working memory .",
    "third , it would seem plausible that high awm agents should always perform better than either low or mid awm agents since these agents always have access to more information .",
    "however the results showed that there are two situations in which this is not an advantage : ( 1 ) when accessing information has some cost ; and ( 2 ) when access to multiple beliefs can lead agents to make divergent inferences . in this case , restricting agents to a small shared working set is a natural way to limit inferential processes .",
    "this limit intuitively corresponds to potential benefits of limited working memory for humans and explains how humans manage to coordinate on inferences in conversation @xcite .",
    "these results clearly demonstrate that factors not previously considered in dialogue models must be taken into account of claims if cooperativity , efficiency , or efficacy are to be supported . in addition , i have shown that a theory of dialogue that includes a model of resource - limited processing can account for both the observed language behavior in human - human dialogue and the experimental results presented here .",
