    "the advent of techniques for measuring masses of supermassive black holes ( bhs ) has led to the identification of correlations between the bh mass ( @xmath2 ) and various properties of the host galaxies .",
    "one of the tightest of these relationships is with the velocity dispersion of the bulge or spheroid ( @xmath1 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "the objects defining the initial @xmath2@xmath1 relationship were primarily quiescent galaxies , with @xmath2 determined from stellar kinematics or gas dynamics .",
    "however , galaxies hosting an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , in which the bh mass was measured via reverberation mapping ( blandford & mckee 1982 ; peterson 1993 ) , have been found to be consistent with following the same correlation ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000b ; ferrarese et al .",
    "2001 [ hereafter paper i ] ; onken et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath2 derived from reverberation mapping are subject to certain systematic uncertainties . in tracing the response of gas in the broad - line region ( blr ) to the variable ionizing continuum of the agn",
    ", the time delay between the fluctuations in the continuum and the `` reverberation '' of the blr emission lines gives a characteristic radius of the blr gas , @xmath3 .",
    "the orbital velocity at that radius is estimated by the width , @xmath4 , of the emission line ( specifically , the variable part of the line ) .",
    "but the kinematics and geometry of the blr introduces a scaling factor , @xmath5 , into the reverberation mass equation : @xmath6 simple models of blr morphologies yield @xmath5 parameters on the order of unity , and the application of such estimates , as in the above references , places the previous agn @xmath2@xmath1 data among the locus of quiescent galaxies .    a uniform relationship between the bh mass and properties of the host galaxy on size scales beyond the strong gravitational influence of the bh implies a causal connection between the formation of the galaxy and the central black hole .",
    "many investigators have explored possible mechanisms for how the evolution of the bh and galaxy could be linked ( e.g. , silk & rees 1998 ; haehnelt & kauffmann 2000 ; adams , graff , & richstone 2001 ; umemura 2001 ; miralda - escud & kollmeier 2003 ; merritt & poon 2004 ) , while others have looked for outliers from these relationships as probes of the physical drivers of the correlations ( e.g. mathur , kuraszkiewicz , & czerny 2001 ; wandel 2002 ; bian & zhao 2004 ; grupe & mathur 2004 ) .",
    "we present measurements of stellar velocity dispersions for 6 reverberation - mapped agns , significantly enlarging the sample of objects which can be used to observationally investigate the @xmath0@xmath1 relationship for active galaxies . in  2 , we describe our observations and analysis method .",
    "we present our results and discuss the implications for the ensemble average value of the reverberation mapping scaling factor , @xmath7 , in  3 .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in  4 .",
    "the velocity dispersions for our sample of agns were measured using the near - infrared triplet ( cat ) .",
    "these stellar absorption lines , at rest wavelengths of @xmath88498 , 8542 , and 8662   , occur in a region of relatively low agn contribution ( nelson & whittle 1995 ) , and are accessible to ground - based observations for sources with redshift @xmath9 ( water vapor bands begin to reduce atmospheric transparency at longer wavelengths ) .",
    "observations were conducted at kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) , cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) , and mdm observatory .",
    "the general observing strategy at each of the telescopes was similar .",
    "long - slit spectra of each target were bracketed by quartz - lamp flat fields and wavelength calibration exposures .",
    "the total exposure time for each agn typically exceeded 10,000 seconds .",
    "in addition to our targets , we obtained spectra of late - type giant stars ( g8  iii  k6  iii ) to use as spectral templates .",

    "the og515 order - separating filter was used .",
    "the detector for these observations was `` charlotte '' , a thinned , backside - illuminated , site 1024@xmath121024 ccd .",
    "the spectra covered a range of @xmath131400   , with a dispersion of about 1.43  pixel@xmath10 , and a slit width of approximately 2@xmath11 .",

    "`` echelle '' , a thinned , backside - illuminated , site 2048@xmath122048 ccd was used with a windowing of 330@xmath122048 pixels .",
    "we used iraf and xvista for the reduction of different subsets of the data .",
    "however , the basic strategy was the same : the spectra were flat - fielded , sky - subtracted , and placed on a linear wavelength scale .",
    "the agn spectra in our sample were often contaminated by the broad  @xmath88446 emission line that appears blueward of the cat , and these lines were removed with a high order polynomial in order to isolate the cat absorption lines .",
    "none of our objects show evidence of emission from high - order paschen emission lines , which can also contaminate the cat lines .",
    "we measured the velocity dispersions from the reduced spectra with the fourier correlation quotient method ( fcq ; bender 1990 ) .",
    "cross - correlating the galaxy spectra with those of the template stars produces values for the central velocity dispersions .",
    "our galaxy spectra and the best template - star fits from the fcq routine are shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the results of our velocity dispersion analysis are listed in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "as noted in paper i , the formal errors reported by the fcq fitting routine tend to underestimate the total uncertainties for the @xmath1 measurements .",
    "thus , in cases where the fcq output errors were smaller than 15% , the error bars have been brought up to this threshold .",
    "based on visual inspection , the least satisfactory fit from figure  [ fig1 ] is that of akn  120 .",
    "consistent ( within 1 @xmath14 ) results are found from three other methods : ( 1 ) a simple gaussian fit to the strongest absorption line ; ( 2 ) the second moment of the profile for that line ; and ( 3 ) an idl routine for penalized pixel fittingmcappell / idl/ for details . ] .",
    "we examined whether the agn continuum could dilute the stellar absorption lines in a manner that would affect the @xmath1 measurements .",
    "this was tested by artificially including an additional continuum contribution and running the fcq routine again . over a large range of continuum levels ,",
    "no significant change was seen in the resulting @xmath1 values .",
    "additional stellar velocity dispersion data for galaxies hosting agns have been taken from the literature .",
    "new analysis of reverberation mapping data has produced updated measurements of the virial products ( @xmath15 ) for a sample of 35 agns , including the 16 which now have velocity dispersions ( peterson et al .",
    "these virial products , which , from equation ( 1 ) , can also be written as @xmath16 , differ from the majority of previous reverberation mapping analyses in the calculation of @xmath17 . whereas earlier work typically characterized the velocity width via the full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the emission line , peterson et al.(2004 )",
    "have found more consistent virial products when using the line dispersion ( i.e. , the second moment of the line profile ; @xmath18 ) instead .",
    "this will have important implications for comparing our results with previous publications .",
    "we assume that the @xmath2@xmath1 correlation found in quiescent galaxies also holds for agns and their host galaxies .",
    "we can then determine the factor required to scale the agn virial products ( @xmath16 ) to the quiescent galaxy relation ( holding @xmath1 fixed at the measured value ) ; that is , we calculate the average scaling factor , @xmath7 , that , when multiplied by the virial products , brings the agn @xmath2@xmath1 relation into agreement with the quiescent galaxy relationship .    because published determinations of the slope of the quiescent galaxy relation have yet to converge , we selected the most prominent slope values from either end of the quoted range .",
    "thus , we consider both the tremaine et al .",
    "( 2002 ; hereafter t02 ) slope of 4.02 , and the ferrarese ( 2002 ; f02 , henceforth ) slope of 4.58 , and determine separate scaling factors , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .    while questions remain as to the reliability of the current fits to the quiescent galaxy @xmath2@xmath1 relation , especially with respect to the accuracy of the black hole masses from stellar kinematics ( see valluri , merritt , & emsellem 2004 ; cretton & emsellem 2004 ; richstone et al .",
    "2004 ) , we hope our use of the two slope values will give a more reliable estimate of the uncertainties involved while also avoiding entanglement in the continuing controversy .    the best fit to the agn @xmath2@xmath1 values was accomplished with the orthogonal regression program , gaussfit ( version 3.53 ; jefferys , fitzpatrick , & mcarthur 1988 ) , which accounts for errors in both ( @xmath16 ) and @xmath1 . for the purposes of our gaussfit analysis",
    ", the asymmetric variances in the virial products were symmetrized as the mean of the upper and lower variances .",
    "a fit was made to the equation @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the normalization of the relationship , @xmath23 is the ( fixed ) value of the slope , and where ( @xmath16 ) is in solar masses and @xmath1 is in km s@xmath10 . for each slope",
    ", the best - fit value of @xmath22 was calculated .",
    "the @xmath24 which was minimized to determine the best fit is given by @xmath25 ^ 2 } { \\sigma_{mi}^2 + \\beta^{\\,2 } \\sigma_{\\sigma i}^2}\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the uncertainties in the virial product and the velocity dispersion , respectively , for the @xmath28th data pair ( press et al .",
    "1992 ) . the virial products and velocity dispersions used in our fits",
    "are given in table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "the published values of the quiescent galaxy intercept correspond to @xmath29 = 8.22@xmath300.08 and @xmath31  =  8.13@xmath300.06 .",
    "our fits with fixed slopes are shown in figure  [ fig2 ] , and yield @xmath32 = 7.48@xmath300.13 and @xmath33",
    "= 7.39@xmath300.12 .",
    "remarkably , both slopes give the same best fit value , @xmath34 = 0.74 .",
    "hence , @xmath20 = 5.5@xmath301.9 and @xmath35 = 5.5@xmath301.7 .",
    "the @xmath36 per degree of freedom , @xmath37 , for these two fits are 2.90 and 2.87 , respectively .",
    "table  [ tab4 ] shows the resulting @xmath22 and @xmath23 values for a variety of fitting constraints .",
    "when we allow @xmath23 to vary in the fit to the agns , the result is consistent with both the t02 and f02 slopes , albeit with a large uncertainty .",
    "the distribution of points with previous @xmath1 measurements in figure  [ fig2 ] differs from that of paper i because of the improved virial product data from peterson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "because the reverberation mapping results for ic  4329a and ngc  4593 provide only upper limits on the black hole masses , these data were omitted from the above analysis .",
    "the formal error bars on @xmath2 can extend below zero because the uncertainty of the time delay is not restricted to positive values .",
    "if we take the uncertainty in @xmath38 to be @xmath39 , we can avoid taking the logarithms of negative numbers , and these two data points can be included in the fit .",
    "the uncertainties are large enough , however , that the fit is not changed in a statistically significant way .",
    "additionally , the fit is not strongly affected by the exclusion of ngc  4051 ( see table  [ tab4 ] ) , which seems to be an outlier in the agn radius - luminosity relationship ( see the appendix of vestergaard 2002 ) .",
    "when we do not include ngc  4051 , we find @xmath40=5.1 and @xmath19=5.2 , differences of less than 8% from our best fit value of 5.5 .",
    "the most common assumption for converting a virial product to @xmath2 is that of netzer ( 1990 ) @xmath41 which implicitly assumes an isotropic velocity distribution and @xmath17 = @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the line full width at half maximum .",
    "peterson et al .  ( 2004 ) measure the second moment of the line profile , @xmath44 , rather than @xmath43 , so an isotropic velocity field simply gives @xmath5 = 3 with no other assumptions . denoting the scale factor as @xmath45 when using @xmath43 and @xmath5 when using @xmath44 , we find that whereas netzer s assumptions give @xmath45 = 0.75 ( as in eq . [ 4 ] ) , the value of @xmath7 we derive above implies @xmath46 = 1.4 , i.e. , black hole masses @xmath131.8 times higher is calculated assuming @xmath44 = @xmath47 ; for typical line profiles , changing the shape of the line alters the @xmath44@xmath43 conversion by an amount smaller than the observed scatter in the @xmath2@xmath1 data . ] .",
    "our masses are only 62% as large as those expected from the @xmath44@xmath43 relation found in a model - dependent fit to the distribution of @xmath43 in a sample of quasars and seyfert galaxies ( mclure & dunlop 2001 ) .    applying our derived value of @xmath7 = 5.5 ( or @xmath48 = 1.4 ) will remove the systematic bias between the virial product and mass of the black hole ( modulo the accuracy of the particular @xmath2@xmath1 fit chosen ) .",
    "yet , estimates for individual agn black hole masses may fall substantially off the @xmath0@xmath1 relation , as there are still rms deviations from the fits in the mass direction of factors of 2.9 ( f02 slope ) and 2.6 ( t02 slope ) .    whether the scatter in @xmath2 is due to differences in the blr properties in each agn ( corresponding to slightly different @xmath5 values for each object ) or a problem in our assumption that all agns fall on the quiescent galaxy relationship",
    "remains unclear .",
    "however , models of the blr may shed light on this question .",
    "given our determination of @xmath7 , we can try to learn something about the structure and kinematics of the blr .",
    "modeling of the blr , taking into account different radial profiles and discrete time sampling of example light curves , will be undertaken in a later paper .",
    "here we describe only a thin , rotating ring . in this case",
    ", @xmath5 can be thought of as relating the keplerian velocity ( @xmath49 ) at the radius of the ring ( which is traced by the appropriate time delay ) to the observed line dispersion : @xmath50 for a ring of inclination @xmath28 ( where @xmath28=@xmath51 for face - on ) , this model gives @xmath5 = @xmath52 .",
    "working within a thin - ring model context , wu & han ( 2001 ) calculated the inclinations necessary to scale published reverberation mapping results for 11 agns to the quiescent galaxy @xmath2@xmath1 relation . with our revised virial product results , we find that this very simple model fails for two of our 16 agns .",
    "ngc  3783 and mrk  110 would require @xmath53 values greater than unity to scale them to the quiescent galaxy @xmath2@xmath1 relation . for our other sources",
    ", we do not find any evidence to support the inclination trends with line width or radio loudness that were claimed by wu & han .",
    "further constraints on the blr geometry are not feasible given the sizes of the current uncertainties .      in principle",
    ", an independent measure of the agn black hole mass can be obtained by detection of gravitational redshifting of the emission lines ( e.g. , netzer 1977 ; peterson et al .",
    "kollatschny ( 2003b ) finds that the variable parts of the strong broad lines in the optical spectrum of mrk  110 are redshifted relative to the systemic velocity .",
    "the reverberation time lag and redshift of each line relative to systemic are anticorrelated and appear to be consistent with a gravitational redshift caused by a central mass @xmath54 , rather higher than our reverberation - based mass , but using fwhm as the line - width measure and @xmath45 = 1.5 ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "the fwhm data of peterson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) gives a result consistent with that of kollatschny , however our preferred method of measuring @xmath18 and using the empirical calibration of @xmath7 yields a black hole mass approximately 40% larger . ] ( table 3 ) of @xmath2 = @xmath55 .",
    "regardless of the particular value of @xmath5 appropriate to mrk  110 , the offset between the reverberation - based virial product and the gravitational redshift mass is in the direction expected .",
    "the value of @xmath56 places mrk  110 even further above the @xmath0@xmath1 relation , which predicts @xmath57 .",
    "if the blr is modeled as a simple disk , then @xmath58 and the difference between these two measurements allows us to infer that @xmath59 , slightly larger than the @xmath60 degrees found by kollatschny ( 2003b ) .    measuring gravitational redshifts appears to be a promising technique for independently estimating central masses .",
    "however , applying the method is non - trivial because the gravitational redshifts are small , typically only several tens to a few hundred kilometers per second .",
    "moreover , it is not a shortcut around reverberation mapping because ( a ) the redshift must be measured in the variable part of the emission line ( i.e. , the root - mean - square spectrum formed from the monitoring data ; see peterson et al .",
    "2004 ) and ( b ) the time lag , which can vary with time , needs to be measured simultaneously . the spectral resolution required to measure such small redshifts reliably is higher than usually employed in reverberation mapping campaigns , with the exception of kollatschny s ( 2003a ) program on mrk  110 and the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "monitoring program on ngc  5548 ( korista et al.1995 ) .",
    "a re - examination of the ngc  5548 spectra from the latter campaign shows some evidence for redshifts at the expected levels , although the errors are quite large .",
    "additional data will thus be required to examine this method of black hole mass measurement more thoroughly and to determine whether mrk  110 is truly a significant outlier from the @xmath2@xmath1 relation .",
    "several recent studies have suggested the use of the fwhm of the [ ] @xmath85007   emission line as a proxy for @xmath1 .",
    "nelson & whittle ( 1996 ) examined a sample of 66 seyfert galaxies with both @xmath1 and fwhm ( [ ] ) measurements and found scatter of 0.20 dex around a 1:1 correspondence ( see their figures 5 and 7a ) .",
    "based on these trends , nelson ( 2000 ) and shields et al .",
    "( 2003 ) used [ ] data as a substitute for @xmath1 in agns out to z@xmath133 .",
    "boroson ( 2003 ) applied the same arguments to data from the sloan digital sky survey early data release and found that using fwhm ( [ ] ) could reproduce an @xmath0@xmath1-like relationship , although with a larger scatter than has been found for quiescent galaxies ( i.e. , a factor of @xmath135 ) .",
    "statistically identical distributions in fwhm ( [ ] ) were found for the broad - line and narrow - line seyfert 1s in an x - ray selected sample of agns , which placed the narrow - line seyfert 1s preferentially below the @xmath2@xmath1 relation ( grupe & mathur 2004 ) .    with the fwhm ( [ ] ) data tabulated by nelson ( 2000 ) for our 16 agns , we looked at the relationship with @xmath1",
    ". figure  [ fig3 ] shows that 25% of the sources have fwhm ( [ ] ) data that deviate by @xmath610.2 dex from the values expected based on their velocity dispersions .",
    "there is no evidence of the correlation between the discrepant objects and their radio power that was found for a larger sample of seyferts ( nelson & whittle 1996 ) , indicating that these differences may not be due to a systematic acceleration of the [ ] -emitting gas by the radio source .",
    "overall , the weighted mean difference from equality is 0.03 dex ( in the sense of larger fwhm relative to @xmath1 ) with an rms scatter of 0.15 dex . in the way of commentary , we simply echo sentiments expressed by others that while use of such a proxy may be valid for a large sample of agns , it can also fail dramatically for individual objects .",
    "with the addition of 6 new velocity dispersion measurements for reverberation - mapped agns and making use of improved reverberation mapping results , we tie together the @xmath0@xmath1 relationships for quiescent galaxies and agns .",
    "this allows us to calculate the average scaling factor , @xmath62 , which removes the statistical bias between the virial product generated by reverberation mapping and the black hole mass . for the f02 and",
    "t02 fits to the quiescent galaxy @xmath2@xmath1 relationship , we find @xmath7 = 5.5@xmath301.9 and 5.5@xmath301.7 , respectively .",
    "these values of @xmath7 apply specifically to virial products using the dispersion of the emission lines , rather than measurements of the fwhm . while modeling of the blr and studies of emission line gravitational redshifts may eventually lead to a better understanding of the structure and kinematics of the blr",
