    "certain complex physical and biological systems have no characteristic scale and exhibit long - range power - law correlations . due to nonlinear mechanisms controlling the underlying interactions , the output signals of complex systems are also typically nonstationary , characterized by embedded trends and heterogeneous segments with different local statistical properties .",
    "traditional methods such as power - spectrum and auto - correlation analysis  @xcite are not suitable for nonstationary signals . to address this problem , detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) was developed to more accurately quantify long - range power - law correlations embedded in a nonstationary time series @xcite .",
    "in addition to quantifying scale - invariant features , dfa has been used to also detect characteristic scales in non - homogeneous signals  @xcite .",
    "the dfa method has been successfully applied to quantify the output dynamics of various physical and biological systems including meteorology  @xcite , climate temperature fluctuations  @xcite , river flow and discharge  @xcite , economics  @xcite , neural receptors in biological systems  @xcite , dna  @xcite , cardiac dynamics  @xcite , and human gait  @xcite .",
    "dfa has been also utilized to identify transitions across different states of the same system characterized by different scaling behavior , e.g. , the scaling exponent for heart - beat intervals discriminates between healthy and sick individuals  @xcite , wake and sleep state  @xcite , and across different sleep stages and circadian phases  @xcite .",
    "further , it has been shown that the dfa scaling exponent obtained from symbolic dna sequences relates to the evolutionary degree of various organisms  @xcite .    to understand the intrinsic dynamics of a given system",
    ", it is important to know how its intrinsic nature ( e.g. nonstationarities ) or external manipulations such as data pre - processing can affect the results . in previous studies we have investigated the effect of various data artifacts on the dfa scaling analysis of long - range power - law correlated signals .",
    "specifically , we considered different types of nonstationarities associated with different trends present in the signal , e.g. , polynomial , sinusoidal and power - law trends  @xcite further , we have studied effects of nonstationarities that are often encountered in real data or result from `` standard '' data pre - processing approaches , e.g. , signals with segments removed , signals with random spikes as well as signals with different local behavior @xcite .",
    "we have also investigated the effects of linear and nonlinear filtering of signals  @xcite and the effects of extreme data loss  @xcite .",
    "comparative studies of the performance of the dfa method and other scaling analysis methods are presented in  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the effect of different coarse - graining approaches on the scaling properties of correlated signals quantified by the dfa .    _ coarse - graining in the magnitude of a signal . _",
    "it consists of the discretization of data and is frequently imposed by the nature of the measurements , i.e. , the limitations on accuracy of instruments , acquisition - data rate or even data - storage requirements . in addition , while in many situations coarse - graining is imposed by the intrinsic nature of the data , in other cases coarse - graining is applied at a latter stage in order , for example , to compute certain information theory measures derived from shannon entropy .",
    "these functionals can be applied only to symbolic or binned time series because they take as arguments probability distributions ( in practice , we never have access to the full distribution function but only to a binned version of it )",
    ".    one of these functionals , especially suitable when dealing with correlations in time series , is the mutual information .",
    "it is well known that mutual information is closely related to the correlation function but , contrary to it , mutual information captures the complete dependence structure , including nonlinear correlations @xcite .",
    "the estimators of mutual information require the data to be binned , i.e. , the range of the data is partitioned and each element of the time series is assigned to an interval of the partition .",
    "this transformation is equivalent to the coarse - graining procedures described in this study , and depending on the details of such transformation the correlation structure of the signal can be modified .",
    "for example , it is known that uniform partitions in some situations can lead to misleading results @xcite .",
    "the measure of correlations using mutual information has been used in several fields : dna sequences @xcite , physiological signals @xcite , quantum information @xcite , complex systems @xcite .    _ coarse graining in time ( or space)_. it consists of substituting the values of the signal in an interval by its mean value . again , this procedure may appear as a direct effect of the measurement ( e.g. sonometers or pyranometers integrate the input during the measurement interval ) or due to further modification of data .",
    "it is common to use this coarse - graining to smooth out the short scale heterogeneities of a signal .",
    "for example it has been recently used to analyze the long - scale structure of dna  @xcite .",
    "another typical application of coarse - graining in time is the mean - field approximation where one considers the mean effect of the interactions during a given period ( in time or space ) in order to simplify the problem .",
    "for example , such techniques have been used to study the growth of fractal structures in the framework of mean - field approximation  @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ method ] , we review the fourier filtering method for generating long - range power - law correlated signals and the dfa method for scaling analysis , and we introduce the floor , symmetry and centro - symmetry methods of coarse - graining in the magnitude of a signal and the coarse - graining in time method . in sec .",

    "in contrast , the effect of centro - symmetry coarse - graining on the scaling behavior is continuously stronger with increasing @xmath3 , and the scale of the crossover @xmath118 is continuously moving . for centro - symmetry coarse - graining with very large @xmath154 , the correlations of strongly correlated signals are destroyed ( @xmath155 ) at small scales , and the correlations at large scales are weakened .    the change we observe in the scaling behavior of both anti - correlated and positively correlated signals @xmath4 after coarse - graining in the magnitude is to some extent similar to the effect of adding noise or random spikes to long - range power - law correlated signals . with increasing",
    "the partition parameter @xmath0 the difference between the increments of the consecutive values @xmath4 in the original signal and the increments of the integer ( symbolic ) values @xmath24 in the coarse - grained signal also increases , effectively equivalent to adding random noise .",
    "it was previously shown @xcite that adding noise and random spikes to anti - correlated signals leads to a crossover to a random behavior at large and intermediate scales , while for positively correlated signals , a crossover to random behavior occurs at small and intermediate scales  a change in the scaling behavior which strongly resembles the effects of coarse - graining investigated here , and which can be explained by a superposition of the scaling curve @xmath104 of the original signal and the scaling curve @xmath124 of a white noise signal intersecting at a crossover scale @xmath118  @xcite .    for coarse - graining in time where data are averaged in non - overlapping time windows , we find that the scaling curve @xmath104 shifts down due to the decrease in the standard deviation of the coarse - grained signal , and that the scaling is practically preserved for positively correlated signals . while for anti - correlated signals there is a slight decrease in the scaling exponent .",
