    "after the cosmic microwave background , galaxy clusters may be our best hope for a precision cosmological probe .",
    "although clusters are highly non  linear objects , the dominant importance of gravitational effects over non  gravitational ones makes them attractive candidates as systems whose properties should be calculable from first principles .",
    "cluster number density evolution has been proposed as a way to determine cosmological parameters including the dark  energy equation of state parameter @xcite . here",
    "we investigate constraints on cosmology possible from measurements of cluster peculiar velocities .",
    "peculiar velocities of galaxies measured via , , the tully  fisher and fundamental plane relations have already been used to constrain cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "these efforts have been hindered by large statistical and systematic errors in the velocity measurements .",
    "in contrast , cluster peculiar velocities determined from the kinetic and thermal sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effects are potentially more reliable .",
    "in addition , sz is the only way to determine peculiar velocities over a wide range of redshifts allowing one to observe the evolution of statistical properties .",
    "about 1% of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons that pass through the gravitationally confined hot gas in the deep potential wells of galaxy clusters compton scatter off a free electron . on average",
    "these photons gain energy causing a spectral distortion of the blackbody nature of the cmb characterized by a deficit of low frequency photons and an excess at high frequencies , with a null near @xmath5 ghz .",
    "specifically the distortion has the frequency dependence @xcite : [ eqn : tsz ] i_i _ = y ( xe^x+1e^x-1 - 4 ) ;   x = hkt_cmb ; + y = k_tm_ec^2dl  t_e(l)n_e(l ) .this spectral distortion has been observed in the direction of numerous known clusters , whose locations had been determined by other means ( optical and/or x - ray surveys ) @xcite .    the bulk motion of the cluster with respect to the cmb causes the kinetic sz effect which , to first order , leads to a hotter ( colder ) blackbody spectrum for a cluster that is moving toward ( away ) from the observer @xcite : = -v_rcx e^xe^x-1 ( t_cmbt_cmb)_sz = - v_rcwhere @xmath6 is the radial component of the velocity .",
    "measurements at multiple frequency bands in the 30 to 400 ghz range can be used to simultaneously determine @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "these two determinations together with a temperature determination can be used to solve for @xmath9 @xcite : = -kt_em_e c^2(t_cmb / t_cmb)_szy . for hotter clusters",
    "there are temperature  dependent corrections to eq .",
    "[ eqn : tsz ] that allow one to solve for the temperature as well . for cooler clusters , x  ray determinations of the temperature",
    "may be necessary .",
    "the best determinations of peculiar velocities from sz measurements have errors of @xmath10 km / s @xcite but can be greatly reduced with more sensitive measurements .",
    "published predictions of achievable @xmath11 @xcite assume that the motions of the electrons in the cluster are simply thermal motions plus one coherent bulk motion . in this case",
    "there is indeed a well  defined `` velocity of the cluster '' , and the error in its measurement is : _ v 25  kms ( 0.01 ) ( t_cmb^2 + t_noise^24 ^2)^12 . in the no  noise ( @xmath12 ) limit and with a confusion noise from the ostriker ",
    "vishniac effect @xcite of @xmath13k ( achievable for clusters of small angular extent which includes any cluster at @xmath14 , and with high ( @xmath15 ) angular resolution ) then @xmath16 km / sec is possible .",
    "however , clusters have _ many _",
    "bulk flows in them , not just one . integrating over all these internal bulk flows , with the mass - weightings naturally provided by the sz effects ,",
    "should still lead to what might be called `` _ the _ velocity of the cluster '' .",
    "but a sizeable fraction of the mass is along lines of sight with quite low optical depth and hence high velocity errors .",
    "the net result is that @xmath17 km / sec is a more likely error @xcite .",
    "we imagine peculiar velocities determined as part of a high  resolution , multi  frequency ( 30 to 400 ghz ) follow  up campaign on a cluster survey .",
    "these clusters may have been found from x  ray , sz or even galaxy redshift surveys ( e.g. , sdss and deepii ) .",
    "important issues are how and how accurately to determine redshifts , how many velocity measurements to make at each redshift and whether to sample densely to study correlations or sparsely to cover more volume .",
    "cluster redshifts may be obtained via ( i ) optical photometric and/or spectroscopic redshifts of galaxy cluster members , ( ii ) measurement of co lines in galaxy cluster members , or ( iii ) x - ray measurements with sufficient spectral resolution .",
    "x - ray and optical data also provide valuable information on the dynamic state of the cluster ; e.g , has the cluster fully virialized , or is it still merging ?",
    "cluster redshifts are already vitally important for determining @xmath18 from thermal sz surveys .",
    "note that interpretation of peculiar velocity correlations is much less sensitive to selection effects than the @xmath19 statistic .",
    "dense sampling puts much higher demand on the accuracy of the redshift determinations . for a specified error in comoving separation @xmath20",
    "we need a redshift error smaller than @xmath21 ; in order to calculate the expected correlations accurately we need @xmath22 mpc . with sparse sampling ,",
    "all we need is a coarse redshift binning and assurance that the clusters are separated by @xmath23 mpc ( comoving ) ; photometric redshifts are almost certainly sufficient for that case .",
    "there are good arguments for targeting the @xmath24 to 0.5 range rather than higher redshifts .",
    "the tolerance on redshift error decreases only slowly with increasing redshift , whereas the amount of telescope time required typically increases dramatically .",
    "in addition , optical and x  ray data on the clusters may be valuable for investigating the dynamical state of the cluster and third x ",
    "ray temperatures are necessary for the colder clusters .",
    "the evolution of the fourier  transformed density contrast @xmath25 in the linear regime is separable , allowing us to write : _ k ( ) = d()_k(_0 ) where @xmath26 is the growth factor and @xmath27 is the conformal time today . from the continuity equation for matter ,",
    "@xmath28 , we see that velocities are probes of the time derivative of @xmath29 .",
    "the correlation between radial velocity components of two clusters at locations @xmath30 and @xmath31 relative to the observer is given by @xcite : [ eqn : psi ] _ ij & & _",
    "i(_i ) ( _ j)_j + & = & _ + ( _ - _ ) r(,r_i , r_j ) + r(,r_i , r_j ) & & ( r_i^2 + r_j^2)- r_ir_j(1 + ^2 ) r_i^2 + r_j^2 - 2r_ir_j + _ , & = & ( r_i)(r_j)2 ^ 2 dk|_k|^2  k_,(kr)where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the comoving distance between the clusters and an overdot symbolizes @xmath36 .",
    "figure [ fig : psiperp ] shows @xmath37 for four different flat cosmologies at redshift @xmath38 .",
    "cosmology dependence in eq .",
    "[ eqn : psi ] arises from : ( i ) the redshift  distance relation @xmath39 and ( ii ) the time  derivative of the growth factor , @xmath40 .",
    "the latter has weak dependence on @xmath2 as we can see from the highly accurate analytic approximation @xcite : ( z ) = d(z)a(z)h(z ) [ _ m(z)]^(w ) because @xmath41 only ranges from about 6/11 to 3/5 for @xmath42 to @xmath43 , and because @xmath44 is also fairly insensitive to @xmath2 for @xmath45 .",
    "in contrast , @xmath46 is highly sensitive to @xmath0 .",
    "for nearly uncorrelated cluster velocities , from , , a very sparse survey , we can easily estimate the expected error variance on @xmath0 from measurement of n clusters with expected peculiar velocity variance @xmath47 : ( _ m)^2 = ( _ i ( _ 0(z_i ) _ m ) ^2 1 2(_0(z_i)+_v^2)^2 ) ^-1  ( .01)^2 where the last equality assumes @xmath48 clusters with @xmath49 all at @xmath38 , and @xmath50 .",
    "we now turn to a fisher matrix analysis of two survey types . for a dense survey",
    ", we sample 820 neighboring clusters from the hubble volume lightcone simulation cluster catalog @xcite over an area of 80 sq . deg . at redshift @xmath3 . for a sparse survey",
    ", we construct a grid of 820 clusters from @xmath51 to 1.0 over an area of 2600 sq .",
    "deg such that all comoving cluster separations are greater than 200 mpc .",
    "we calculate the expected covariances in linear theory for a density field smoothed with a 5 mpc radius tophat filter .",
    "we calculate their partial derivatives by finite difference .",
    "the models we difference have fixed cobe normalization @xcite .",
    "all our results in figure [ fig : enchilada ] assume a noise level of 100 km / s .",
    "as expected , @xmath0 is measured very well .",
    "neither @xmath52 nor @xmath2 are well constrained ; nor do they lead to significant confusion in the @xmath0 measurement .",
    "in addition the results are very similar for our two different survey types , with the sparse survey ( dashed lines ) marginally more constraining than the dense survey .",
    "both increasing the velocity errors to greater than the assumed 100 km / sec and including the effects of redshift errors will improve the sparse sampling result in comparison to the dense sampling result .",
    "we expect that linear theory provides only a rough guide to the constraints possible from peculiar velocity measurements .",
    "numerically  determined variances agree with linear theory predictions to @xmath53 40% in the present epoch @xcite .",
    "we plan to include non  linear and biasing effects by use of the pinocchio gravitational instability code @xcite . with pinocchio",
    "we will obtain highly accurate calculations of the velocity correlation functions in several models and once again use finite difference to calculate fisher matrices .",
    "cluster peculiar velocity measurements are highly sensitive to @xmath0 and largely insensitive to @xmath52 and @xmath2 .",
    "sparse sampling is probably preferable to dense sampling .",
    "velocity determinations of @xmath54 clusters can potentially be used to determine @xmath0 to @xmath55 .",
    "this @xmath2independent measurement of @xmath0 may be useful for improving @xmath2 constraints from observations of type ia supernovae @xcite .",
