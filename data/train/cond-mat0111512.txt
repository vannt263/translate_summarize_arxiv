    "the statistical properties of dilute polymers in good solvents have been the subject of extensive studies during the years @xcite .",
    "a significant understanding of the problem was reached when it was realized that long polymers could be modelled by chains with an excluded - volume interaction .",
    "this allowed the introduction of simplified theoretical models which could be analyzed more easily . from a theoretical point of view ,",
    "an important step forward was made by de gennes @xcite , who proved that the statistical properties of dilute polymers could be obtained as the limit @xmath0 of the @xmath1-component @xmath2 theory , opening the field to the many methods that have been developed for the study of the critical behavior of spin systems .    in nature polymers",
    "may have many different geometrical conformations . in this paper",
    "we will focus on ring polymers and we will determine the structure factor and the monomer - monomer distribution function . for this purpose we will use the mapping with the @xmath3 theory @xcite and some recent theoretical results for the two - point function of biquadratic operators @xcite .",
    "indeed , we show that the structure factor is directly related to the energy - energy correlation function . then , by extending the results available for the end - to - end distribution function @xcite , we compute its large- and small - momentum behavior .",
    "moreover , by using an interpolation formula based on a dispersive approach @xcite , we obtain a general expression valid for all momenta , i.e. for all values of the radiation ( neutron ) wavelength .",
    "we also investigate the monomer - monomer distribution function that is closely related to the structure factor by a fourier transform .",
    "its properties for small and large distances are investigated in detail .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we define the structure factor and the monomer - monomer distribution function for @xmath4-step ring polymers . in sec .",
    "[ sec3.1 ] we show that the computation of the structure factor is equivalent to the calculation of the energy - energy correlation function in the @xmath1-component @xmath3 theory in the limit @xmath0 .",
    "field - theoretical results for such a correlation function are reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec3.2 ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we study the structure factor . in particular , we determine its small-@xmath5 behavior extending the classical guinier formula , its large-@xmath5 behavior , and give a general interpolation formula that has the correct asymptotic behavior for @xmath6 and @xmath7 . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] we report the corresponding expressions for the monomer - monomer distribution function .",
    "we also verify that the phenomenological expression often used for the end - to - end distribution function for linear polymers @xcite also provides a good approximation to the monomer - monomer distribution function considered here .",
    "we consider a monodisperse ensemble of ring polymers with @xmath4 monomers , labelling the monomers from 1 to @xmath4 .",
    "then , we consider two monomers @xmath8 and @xmath9 of the walk and the unnormalized distribution @xmath10 of the distance @xmath11 between the two monomers .",
    "such a distribution function depends only on the relative position @xmath12 of the monomers along the polymer .",
    "then , we define its average over all pairs @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath14 the corresponding normalized distribution @xmath15 and the mean squared radius of gyration @xmath16 on a lattice , @xmath10 can be identified with the number of @xmath4-step lattice rooted self - avoiding polygons such that monomer @xmath8 is in the origin and monomer @xmath9 is in @xmath11 . note that @xmath17 is the total number of @xmath4-step lattice rooted polygons .",
    "the structure factor is defined by @xmath18 which , by definition , satisfies @xmath19 . for elastic scattering , the momentum @xmath20 is directly related to the wavelength @xmath21 of the incoming radiation in the scattering medium and to the scattering angle @xmath22 by @xmath23    for comparison",
    ", we will also consider linear polymers and correspondingly we define the mean squared end - to - end distance @xmath24 and the mean squared radius of gyration @xmath25 . in the limit @xmath26 ,",
    "the radius of gyration and the end - to - end distance diverge with the same critical exponent @xmath27 , i.e. @xmath28 in two dimensions the universal exponent @xmath27 is given by @xmath29 , while in three dimensions @xmath30 see ref .",
