    "a snapshot of a high - resolution dark matter simulation , at relatively low redshift , reveals that halos are neither spherically symmetric nor smooth .",
    "this is because , without even considering all the small scale complications arising from baryonic physics ( i.e. pressure effects , merging , cooling , heating ) , the statistics of a gaussian random field implies that spherically symmetric initial configurations should be a set of measure zero ( doroshkevich 1970 ) . while it has long been recognized that spherical collapse is too idealized to be realistic , and that the true gravitational process must , at the very least , be ellipsoidal ( icke 1973 ; white & silk 1979 ; barrow & silk 1981 ; kuhlman et al .",
    "1996 ) , most analytic models of structure formation make the simplifying assumption that gravitationally bound objects are spherical , and formed from a spherical collapse ( i.e. gunn & gott 1972 ; lahav et al .",
    "1991 ; lacey & cole 1993 ; lokas & hoffman 2001 ) .    it has also become common practice to identify halos in simulations using a spherical overdensity algorithm , which finds the mass around isolated peaks in the density field such that the mean interior density is @xmath0 times the background density , where the value of @xmath0 is motivated by the spherical top - hat model ( lacey & cole 1994 ) .",
    "this is despite the fact that dark matter halos that form in simulations are rather elongated , and , in general , strongly triaxial : close to prolate ( minor and intermediate axes are comparable in size to each other , and much smaller than the biggest axis ) in the central parts , and rounder in the outskirts ( barnes & efstathiou 1987 ; frenk et al . 1988 ; dubinski & carlberg 1991 ; katz 1991 ; warren et al .",
    "1992 ; jing et al .",

    "this shape variation leads to a significant variance in local properties , compared to the spherically averaged value at a given radius , that are now becoming of interest .",
    "studying and quantifying the degree of halo triaxiality is of broader importance .",
    "in fact , in the current paradigm of hierarchical clustering , dark matter halos are the hosts within which gas cools and collapses to form galaxies ( white & rees 1978 ; white & frenk 1991 ) , thus making them the building blocks of the large scale structure ( lss ) of the universe ( cooray & sheth 2002 ) .",
    "hence , understanding the assembly histories , kinematics , clustering , and fundamental structural properties of halos  such as their intrinsic shapes  is the first necessary step in understanding the properties of galaxies ( mo , mao & white 1998 ; dutton et al .",
    "2007 ; diemand et al .",
    "2008 ) . in turn",
    ", the formation of dark matter halos affects the properties of the galaxies hosted by the halos ; therefore , inspection of the galaxy distribution in redshift surveys such as the sdss ( york et al .",
    "2000 ) allows one to relate the properties of galaxies to those of their host halos .",
    "moreover , the characteristic density of a halo appears to track the mean density of the universe at the time of its formation ( e.g. zhao et al .",
    "2009 ) , leading to a quasi - universal profile ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 ; kormendy & freeman 2004 ) , although self - similarity is not preserved : different halos can not be rescaled to look alike ( navarro et al .",
    "2004 , 2010 ; merritt et al . 2006",
    "; gao et al . 2008 ; reed et al . 2010 ) .",
    "triaxiality also has a number of observationally relevant implications .",
    "for example , modeling of dark matter halos beyond the spherical approximation is crucial in understanding the nonlinear clustering of halos and dark matter ( sheth , mo & tormen 2001 ) , the formation and evolution of galaxies ( cole & lacey 1996 ) , and their relation to the cosmic web ( shen et al .",

    "in particular , the higher order statistics of the nonlinear density field is sensitive to halo triaxiality ( smith & watts 2005 ; smith , watts & sheth 2006 ) .",
    "triaxiality represents a useful framework for the non - spherical modelling of the intracluster gas , which recent observations suggest will be key in deriving more accurate temperature profiles of x - ray clusters , and in general for cosmological parameter determinations via the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( lee et al .",
    "for example , kawahara ( 2010 ) has derived the axis ratio distribution of x - ray clusters in the xmm - newton catalog of snowden et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and confirmed that the typical x - ray halo is well approximated by a triaxial ellipsoid . and",
    "recently , morandi , pedersen & limousin ( 2010 ) have presented the first determination of the intrinsic triaxial shapes and three - dimensional physical parameters of both dark matter and the intra - cluster medium for the galaxy cluster abell 1689 .",
    "triaxiality is also useful in predicting  and hence can be constrained by  a variety of gravitational lensing observations , including weak and strong lens statistics ( bartelmann 1995 ; van waerbeke et al .",

    "; parker et al . 2007 )",
    ".    surveys like esa s euclid mission ( http://sci.esa.int/euclid ) will in fact provide accurate data for shape estimates through `` cosmic shear '' , a direct measure of the metric fluctuations in the universe ( hoekstra & jain 2008 ; bernstein 2010 ; rhodes et al . 2010 ) , which in turn constrain dark energy properties ( albrecht et al .",
    "a primary source of noise in such measurements is due to the difficulty in distinguishing between intrinsic galaxy shapes and shape distortion due to lensing ( bartelmann & schneider 2001 ; refregier 2003 ; hoekstra et al . 2005 ; mandelbaum et al 2006 ; bridle et al .",
    "hence accurate modelling of the correlated shapes and orientations dark matter halos can be extremely useful .",
    "the higher order statistics of the nonlinear density field in such surveys is also sensitive to halo triaxiality ( smith et al .",
    "2006 ) .    on galaxy mass scales",
    ", an understanding of halo triaxiality provides useful input to studies of galactic disks in triaxial halos .",
    "e.g. , jeon , kim & ann ( 2009 ) considered the fundamental dynamics between the disk and the axisymmetric or triaxial halo , and valluri et al .",
    "( 2010 ) analyzed the orbital structure of dark matter particles in @xmath1-body simulations in an effort to understand what is the physical mechanism driving shape changes caused by growing central masses ( also see debattista et al . 2008 ) .",
    "this shape change reconciles the strongly prolate - triaxial shapes found in collisionless @xmath1-body simulations with observations , which generally find much rounder halos ( see for example banerjee & jog 2008 ) .",
    "finally , resolving the fine grained structure of galaxy mass halos enables one to make more realistic predictions for direct and indirect dark matter detection experiments ( e.g. giocoli , pieri & tormen 2008 ) .",
    "the shapes of dark matter halos can be quantified using high - resolution @xmath1-body simulations of hierarchical gravitational clustering .",
    "this is currently the best way to address many of the tasks above .",
    "simulations are becoming increasingly accurate in mass and spatial resolution : e.g. , the millennium run ( springel et al . 2005 ) , the horizon run ( kim et al .",
    "2009 ) , the millennium ii ( boylan - kolchin et al .",
    "2009 ) and the bolshoi simulation ( klypin et al . 2010 ) .    in these numerical studies ,",
    "many different aspects have been considered over a wide range of physical scales and cosmic histories .",
    "common findings suggest that the total mass is the key in determining the final shapes of halos , although other environmental parameters may play a role in the process . in general , halos",
    "do exhibit a rich variety of shapes with a preference for prolateness over oblateness .",
    "more massive halos tend to be less spherical and more prolate , and are preferentially aligned with primordial filaments , while less massive halos are in general rounder ( e.g. , jing & suto 2002 ; allgood et al .",
    "2006 ; araya - melo et al . 2009 ) . on the other hand",
    ", perturbation theory suggests that the most massive objects should be spherical ( bernardeau 1994 ; pogosyan et al .",
    "1998 ) , and lemson ( 1995 ) showed that the spherical model does provide a good description of the evolution of the spherically averaged profile .",
    "more recently , dalal et al . ( 2008 ) reported that massive halos are indeed very well described by the spherical collapse model .",
    "this was recently confirmed by park et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , who provided a clear explanation for the discrepancy with previous measurements .",
    "the shapes of subhalos are similar to those of host halos , but subhalos tend to be a bit rounder , especially the ones near the host halo center .",
    "tidal interactions make individual subhalos rounder over time and they tend to align their major axis towards the center of the host halo .",
    "formation of halos is also affected by the large - scale environment , which may have an impact on their shapes , and those shapes can be modified by galaxy formation as well .",
    "subhalos are not the subject of our study .",
    "there are many more numerical studies of halo shapes than analytic models .",
    "this is because the formation , evolution and virialization of dark matter halos is complex ; no rigorous analytic techniques are available for use in both the linear and the nonlinear regimes . in addition , choosing the appropriate definition of halo shapes is subtle . for example ,",
    "eisenstein & loeb ( 1995 ) describe an analysis of halo shapes which uses the ellipsoidal collapse model of bond & myers ( 1996 ) .",
    "however , as we discuss below , their definition of a halo differs from the more commonly accepted definition .",
    "moreover , they present results for collapsed objects that had the same initial density . since the time it takes for to collapse is a complicated function of density _ and _ shape ( bond & myers 1996 ) , this means that they compare objects of one shape at one time with those of another shape at a different time .",
    "this is rarely measured in simulations : the shape distribution of most interest is , of course , that for a fixed time ( e.g. , halos at @xmath2 ) .",
    "the main purpose of the present work is to provide a simple model for the distribution of halo shapes at any given time as seen in the simulations , starting from first principles . following rossi ( 2008 ) , our analytic prescription has two independent parts :",
    "the first is a scheme for how an initially spherical patch evolves and virializes ; the second is the correct assignment of initial shapes to halos of different masses .    in this respect ,",
    "our model is similar in philosophy to that of lee , jing & suto ( 2005 ) .",
    "however , there are important differences .",
    "( 1 ) they assume the zeldovich approximation remains valid even during the nonlinear regime , where it is known to fail ; ( 2 ) they assume a spherical collapse threshold for the formation of halos , or an empirical recipe based on lee & shandarin ( 1998 ) .",
    "in contrast , because we are modelling triaxial objects , we self - consistently use ellipsoidal , rather than spherical collapse dynamics to generate our predictions .    to describe the evolution of non - spherical structures we adopt the ellipsoidal collapse model of bond & myers ( 1996 ) , which was used by sheth , mo & tormen ( 2001 ) to estimate of how the abundance of dark matter halos depends on halo mass . in this model ,",
    "dark matter halos are identified with ellipsoids which have collapsed completely along all three axes ( we show below that , in effect , the eisenstein & loeb 1995 definition corresponds to collapse along just two axes ) . in this framework ,",
    "the time required to collapse depends on the overdensity @xmath3 and size @xmath4 of the initial patch , and on the surrounding shear field , parametrized by its ellipticity @xmath5 and prolateness @xmath6 . requiring the collapse to happen at a given time makes @xmath3 a function of @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( sheth et al .",
    "2001 ) : @xmath7 .",
    "the combination of @xmath8 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 determines the axis ratios of the object at all times , and , in particular , at the final time .",
    "thus ( @xmath9 ) establishes the time of collapse ( it was this fact which was exploited by sheth et al .",
    "2001 ) , as well as the axis ratios at collapse ( a fact we exploit here ) .",
    "the second part is the correct assignment of ( @xmath9 ) values to halos of different masses .",
    "we do this following sheth & tormen ( 2002 ) ( also see chiueh & lee 2001 ; sandvik et al .",
    "in essence , the correct ( @xmath9 ) distribution is specified by the statistics of gaussian random fields . in a gaussian random field ,",
    "the distribution of ( @xmath9 ) values depends on the size and overdensity of the patch : @xmath10 .",
    "massive halos form from larger patches in the initial conditions than do less massive halos , so we expect the distribution of initial ( @xmath9 ) values , and hence the distribution of final axis ratios , to also depend on halo mass .",
    "thus , although the generic evolution is initially towards an oblate , pancake - like structure , followed by a shift towards a more prolate shape , as the other axes also begin to shrink , quantifying this evolution , and merging it with the correct ( mass dependent ) initial distribution of shapes is the main focus of this work .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ nl_dynamics ]",
    "we present the ellipsoidal model for the gravitational collapse of an initially spherical patch ; we discuss a reasonably accurate analytic approximation to the evolution , more rigorous than the zeldovich approximation ; we introduce the axis ratio plane , which provides a concise description of the dynamics of collapsing regions and allows one to relate the final shape of a halo with its original , pre - collapsed , shape . in section [ initial_conditions ]",
    "we present the full model for halo shapes , we explain how the initial conditions are obtained via the excursion set algorithm , and we expand on the prolateness distribution  crucial in understanding our main results . in section [ simulation_comparison ] the model is contrasted with high resolution @xmath1-body simulations .",
    "a simple explanation of an empirical relation found by jing & suto ( 2002 ) is given , and a number of caveats in the comparison model / simulations are highlighted .",
    "finally , section [ discussion ] discusses in detail limitations in the modelling and difficulties arising from numerical studies , and suggests future improvements .    in our calculations",
    "we assume a spatially flat cosmological model with @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the present day densities of matter and cosmological constant scaled to the critical density .",
    "we write the hubble constant as @xmath14 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 .",
    "regarding the overall notation , we always use the subscript @xmath16 to denote initial quantities , and the subscript @xmath17 for final quantities .",
    "the expansion factor of the universe , with mean density @xmath18 , is represented by the small case letter @xmath19  not to be confused with the capital letter @xmath20 , which denotes the axis ratios of an ellipsoidal patch .",
    "the nonlinear gravitational evolution of a medium is complex , even without complications arising from gas dynamics .",
    "it involves smooth accretion , tidal interactions with the environment as well as violent episodes of collisions with other halos , merging and fragmentation . in what follows",
    ", we first briefly summarize the key aspects of the ellipsoidal collapse .",
    "we then discuss an analytic approximation for the evolution , and introduce a planar representation of halo axis ratios ; this allows for a concise description of the dynamics of collapsing regions , and provides a mapping between the initial and final shape of a halo .",
    "the simplest description of the gravitational evolution and virialization of a cosmic structure is the spherical collapse model ( gunn & gott 1972 ; gott 1975 ; gunn 1977 ; fillmore & goldreich 1984 ; bertschinger 1985 ; mo & white 1996 ) . in this framework , an isolated overdensity in an otherwise unperturbed universe",
    "first expands with the hubble flow , then turns around and collapses .",
    "however , the initial shear field , rather than the density , has been shown to play a crucial role in the formation of nonlinear structures ( zeldovich 1970 ; hoffman 1986 , 1988 ; peebles 1990 ; dubinski 1992 ; van de weygaert & babul 1994 ; audit & alimi 1996 ; audit , teyssier & alimi 1997 ) .",
    "therefore , refinements to the spherical approximation which include local shear effects can be obtained by introducing an ellipsoidal collapse scheme ( bond & myers 1996 ; eisensein & loeb 1995 ; monaco 1995 , 1997 , 1998 ; lee & shandarin 1998 ; chiueh & lee 2001 ; sheth , mo & tormen 2001 ; sheth & tormen 2002 ; ohta et al .",

    "2006 ; sandvik et al .",
    "2007 ; desjacques 2008 ; desjacques & smith 2008 ; rossi 2008 ) .    in this study",
    "we adopt the homogeneous ellipsoidal model in the form of bond & myers ( 1996 ) , although the ellipsoidal collapse has a long history ( lin , mestel & shu 1965 ; icke 1973 ; white & silk 1979 ; barrow & silk 1981 ) .",
    "to lowest order , their algorithm reduces to zeldovich s ( 1970 ) approximation , and so linear theory is reproduced . in this framework , an initially spherical patch of initial size @xmath4 with overdensity @xmath3 is distorted by the shear field into a collapsing homogeneous ellipsoid . the exterior tidal force arising from the matter outside of the ellipsoid",
    "is completely determined by the volume - averaged strain of the ellipsoid .",
    "the details of the substructure in the interior are ignored , and the strongly nonlinear internal dynamics of the collapsing patch are assumed to be largely decoupled from the weakly nonlinear dynamics describing the motion of the patch itself ; in this respect , the homogeneous ellipsoid picture may be thought of as a tensor virial theorem approach to the average interior dynamics .",
    "in fact , in the nonlinear regime the one - to - one correspondence between the external tidal field and the local strain tensor is no longer true on small scales where the rms density fluctuation @xmath21 ; therefore , one would not expect the simple ellipsoidal model to apply in this regime .",
    "there is another sense in which this approach is only a simple approximation .",
    "it assumes that the inertia tensor of the final bound object is perfectly correlated with the local tidal tensor in the initial lagrangian space .",
    "measurements in simulations show that the two tensors are not perfectly correlated ( e.g. lee & pen 2000 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the correlation is stronger than naive tidal torque theories predict ( e.g. , porciani , dekel & hoffman 2002 ) , so the assumption of perfect correlation is a useful idealization .",
    "it is usual to characterize the initial shear field by the ellipticity @xmath5 and prolateness @xmath6 associated with the potential rather than with the density field ( i.e. bardeen et al . 1986 ) .",
    "this is because the components of the @xmath22 strain tensor are the second derivatives of the potential .",
    "the eigenvalues of the initial strain tensor are related to the initial density contrast and to the shear ellipticity and prolateness by : @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 note that @xmath26 . if @xmath27 , then @xmath28 and @xmath29 , so @xmath30 .    )",

    "other possibilities for @xmath38 include the ` nonlinear ' ( bond & myers 1996 ) , or the ` hybrid ' ( angrick & bartelmann 2010 ) approximations .",
    "however , in our case we are concerned with later times , where a different choice for the external shear field does not significantly affect our conclusions .",
    "if @xmath42 , then all three eigenvalues equal @xmath43 , hence all three axes have the same length initially . in this case , the exterior anisotropic tidal force is zero and @xmath44 , so one gets the usual cycloid solution for a closed universe .",

    "in addition , massive halos are predicted to be more spherical than less massive halos , both initially and finally .",
    "this is primarily a consequence of the fact that the larger patches from which massive halos form have , on average , smaller values of ( @xmath9 ) .",

    "the dotted lines represent the joint distribution which jing & suto ( 2002 ) report describe the halos in their simulations .",
    "note , for the moment , that our model appears to be in reasonable agreement with the simulations only around @xmath141 .",
    "while this agreement is gratifying , the fact that the mismatch is mass - dependent is potentially troubling .",
    "jing & suto find that the low mass halos are actually slightly more spherical than massive halos .",
    "although the effect is weak , it has since been confirmed by a long list of authors ( see section [ intro ] ) .",
    "in contrast , in our model , it is the massive halos which are expected to be more spherical ( figure  [ in_fin_shapes ] ) .",
    "the trend we find is consistent with perturbation theory ( bernardeau 1994 ; pogosyan et al .",
    "1998 ; see park et al .",
    "2007 , dalal et al . 2008 and",
    "park , kim & park 2010 for more recent discussion of this point ) .    to show this more clearly",
    ", figure [ js_comparison ] compares the final distribution of @xmath73 in our model ( dotted ) with the distribution in jing & suto s simulations ( solid ) at @xmath2 .",
    "again , note that the agreement is reasonable around @xmath142 , but that the predicted distribution is broader than the simulations at low and high masses . note also that the left panels in the figure show our results without any arbitrary rescaling , while in the right panels we apply the empirical rescaling they suggest , which effectively removes the trend with mass .",
    "park , kim & park ( 2010 ) have argued that the main reason for this discrepancy may be due to the halo definition itself , and to the halo environment .",
    "they used a more sophisticated halo finding algorithm ( from kim & park 2006 ) which identifies gravitationally self - bound and tidally stable halos .",
    "they showed that the dependence of @xmath73 on local density is stronger for more massive _ isolated _ halos , and argued that tidal interactions between neighboring halos make them more spherical on average .",
    "in particular , park , kim & park ( 2010 ) pointed out that the main problem relies primarily on the fof halo finder .",
    "this is because the fof identification scheme can not distinguish between objects connected by filaments .",
    "for example , if two massive and almost spherical neighboring halos are slightly connected by a filament , the fof halo finder will consider those objects as one big structure , and erroneously assign a rather elongated shape to it .",
    "therefore , the fof scheme will find that more massive objects are more elongated , while in reality this is an artifact of the fof procedure .",
    "park et al . ( 2010 ) went one step further ; after running their halo finder algorithm , they identified subhalos within fof halos , and classified their fof halos into central ( i.e. the most massive halos in each group of halos and subhalos ) , satellite ( i.e. halos which are not the central ones in each group of halos and subhalos ) , and isolated halos ( i.e. structures which do not overlap with other halos , but which can have close neighbor halos and subhalos ) .",
    "after this classification , they found that the degree of halo sphericity increases with mass ( i.e. more massive objects are rounder ) for _ isolated _ halos , up to about @xmath143  a similar trend we find in our theoretical study .",
    "the left panel of figure [ p_cbca ] compares the conditional minor - to - intermediate axis distribution of @xmath144 for a given range of @xmath73 in our model ( histograms ) , with jing & suto s simulations ( solid lines ) at @xmath2 . in this case , instead , we find remarkably good agreement with the numerical measurements .",
    "recall that we had argued that the conditional prolateness distribution @xmath117 in the initial conditions ( equation  [ js_explain ] and figure  [ pro_given_eli ] ) , depends only weakly on @xmath107 , so we expect the conditional minor - to - intermediate axis ratio distribution of the evolved object , @xmath145 , to be similarly universal ",
    "independent of mass and time ; whether this equivalence is due to statistics , rather than physics , is subject of ongoing work .",
    "the agreement with jing & suto s simulations suggests that @xmath145 is indeed preserved from the initial conditions .",
    "in fact , except for the exponential factor in our equation  ( [ js_explain ] ) , our theoretically motivated expression for this distribution is _ exactly _ the same as that of jing & suto s empirical fitting formula .",
    "more recently , wang et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have also found that , in their simulations , @xmath146 is independent of mass and epoch .",
    "they also noted that the final redshift dependence of the short - to - intermediate axial ratio is much weaker than the other two ratios , indicating that new material tends to be accreted along the major axes of halos .",
    "our formula  ( [ js_explain ] ) provides the theoretical / physical explanation for their findings .    in this context",
    ", we note that lee , jing & suto ( 2005 ) also presented an analytic expression for the axis ratio distribution of triaxial objects , and claimed that it successfully reproduces the conditional intermediate - to - major axis ratio distribution .",
    "however , in their figure  5 which is supposed to support this claim , it is the _ minor - to - intermediate _",
    "distribution from the numerical simulations , @xmath147 , which is compared with their theory curve for the _ intermediate - to - major _ axis ratio distribution , @xmath148 .",
    "while this invalidates their claim ( see also appendix [ ljs_problems ] for more discussion on the flaw in their model ) , it does raise the question of why the formula for one distribution happened to describe another ?",
    "our model shows why .",
    "when @xmath78 , then @xmath149 , while @xmath150 .",
    "however , the sign difference in the prolateness does not alter the jacobian of the two different transformations : ( @xmath151 ) and ( @xmath152 ) .",
    "hence , @xmath153 , and therefore @xmath154 thus , at fixed @xmath73 , the minor - to - intermediate or the intermediate - to - major axis ratios distributions are both equivalent , and so ` universal ' .",
    "although _ equivalent _ , clearly these distributions are indeed different and neatly distinguishable : the right panel of figure [ p_cbca ] compares now the conditional intermediate - to - major axis distribution of @xmath74 for a given range of @xmath73 in our model ( histograms ) , with jing & suto s simulations ( solid lines ) at @xmath2 . as evident from the plots , @xmath148 is more asymmetric than @xmath147 , and the difference is more significant for lower values of @xmath73 .          in general ,",
    "a direct comparison between our theoretical model and @xmath1-body simulations is both challenging and subtle .",
    "this is primarily because there is still no unanimous agreement about how to define a gravitationally bound object ; i.e the very definition of what a non - spherical dark matter halo is , both in simulations and observationally , is a non - trivial problem . determining which material belongs to a halo and what lies beyond is an open problem ( prada et al .",
    "2006 ; bett et al .",
    "2007 ; diemand , kuhlen & madau 2007 ; cuesta et al . 2008 ) .",
    "common methods for defining virialized halos in simulations include : spherical overdensity , tree algorithms based on the branches of the halo merger trees , two - step procedures with post - processing , maximum circular velocity , etc . , ( see klypin et al . 2010 , and references therein for more discussion ) .",
    "clearly , the distribution of halo shapes measured from simulations depends critically on the halo definition .",
    "for instance , bett et al . ( 2007 ) found that spherical overdensity halos are more spherical than fof or tree halos , and that fof halos show a much broader distribution of shapes and a strong preference for prolateness .",
    "this fact complicates the comparison and interpretation of theory against any numerical study",
    ".    since we are most interested in halo shapes , measurements which do not perform spherical averages are more closely related to our models .",
    "jing & suto ( 2002 ) used one such method : a friend - of - friend algorithm ( davis et al .",
    "1985 ; lacey & cole 1994 ) .",
    "this is a percolation scheme that links together all particles that are closer than @xmath155 , where @xmath136 is the mean interparticle separation .",
    "this value of @xmath156 returns objects which are approximately 200 times the background density : it makes no assumptions about the shape of the resulting object .",
    "however , it may group distinct halos together into the same object , confusing the comparison with theory ( white 2001 ; tinker et al .",
    "2008 ; lukic et al .",
    "this problem is more serious for halos in higher density regions ; since high density regions have top - heavy mass functions ( sheth & tormen 2002 ) , massive halos identified by this algorithm may be erroneously considered to be elongated .",
    "jing & suto ( 2002 ) used @xmath135 , so their fof clumps are smaller and denser than those defined using the more conventional @xmath157 . as a result , they are less likely to suffer from spuriously linked halos . however , in effect , their procedure identifies only the central parts of the more conventional halo .    as a further complication , having settled on a halo definition",
    ", some authors only study shapes of a subset of the halo population .",
    "e.g. , jing & suto ( 2002 ) , only analyzed halos which looked ` relaxed ' : at fixed mass , this is almost certainly a more homogeneous subset of the entire population .",
    "our model does not account for this additional selection .    despite such difficulties in the model / simulation comparison ,",
    "we believe such an exercise is still useful , because there are other reasons why we anticipate disagreement between model and simulations .",
    "e.g. , the ellipsoidal collapse itself is a significant oversimplification of the more complex nonlinear gravitational evolution ",
    "it can not be expected to fully capture the dynamics of @xmath1-body simulations . despite all these caveats",
    ", we believe the remarkably good agreement between the measured conditional axis ratio distributions and our equation  ( [ js_explain ] ) ( figure  [ p_cbca ] ) is non - trivial .",
    "we presented a model to describe the shape distribution of bound objects based on rossi ( 2008 ) , which is a simple extension of that introduced by bond & myers ( 1996 ) and used by sheth , mo & tormen ( 2001 ) to estimate the abundance by mass of these objects .",
    "our analytic prescription is made of two independent parts : one is a scheme for how an initially spherical patch evolves and virializes , for which we adopted the ellipsoidal collapse dynamics ( section [ nl_dynamics ] , figure [ ellipsoid_evolution_fig ] ) ; the other is the correct assignment of initial shapes to halos of different masses , achieved through the excursion set formalism ( section [ initial_conditions ] , figure [ in_fin_shapes ] ) . along the way , we discussed an analytic approximation to the evolution , considerably more rigorous than the zeldovich approximation ( section [ analytic_proxy ] , figure [ ellipsoid_evolution_approx_fig ] ) .",
    "and we introduced a useful planar representation of halo axis ratios , which gives a simple intuitive framework for discussing the dynamics of collapsing regions ( section [ axis_ratio_plane ] , figure [ ax_rat_plane ] ) .",
    "we showed that the model is able to provide a reasonable description of the minor - to - major axis ratio distribution seen by jing & suto ( 2002 ) in their numerical simulations only within a limited mass range ( i.e. around @xmath158 ) .",
    "outside this range , jing & suto found that low - mass halos are preferentially more spherical than high - mass halos , whereas in our model , the high - mass halos are more spherical ( figures [ shapes_in_sim ] and [ js_comparison ] ) .",
    "we argued that some the disagreements may originate from differences in halo types and mass range , and may be alleviated if we consider only _ isolated _ halos .",
    "this is because park , kim & park ( 2010 ) find that , on average , high - mass isolated halos are indeed more spherical than low - mass ones , and the difference is larger in high density / shear regions ( see their section 3.4 and their figures 9 , 10 and 11 , for details on how to select isolated clusters from simulations ) .",
    "note also that isolated clusters can be readily identified from an observational catalog , as done for example in park & hwang ( 2009 ) for a sample of abell galaxy clusters ( their section 2.2 gives a detailed explanation on how the selection is performed ) .",
    "the finding of park , kim & park ( 2010 ) has an interesting connection to recent observational work on mass scales where the hypothesis that a halo hosts only one galaxy may be appropriate . for early - type galaxies in the sdss ,",
    "although the observed projected axis ratio @xmath159 increases with increasing stellar mass or luminosity , it decreases at the highest masses ( bernardi et al .",
    "2008 , 2010 ) .",
    "this reversal is thought to arise because the most massive galaxies tend to be in regions ( e.g. , at cluster centers ) where recent radial mergers may have made them prolate .",
    "fasano et al .",
    "( 2010 ) come to a similar conclusion based on an analysis of the intrinsic shape distribution of bcgs from the wings survey ( fasano et al .",
    "2006 ; varela et al . 2009 ) .",
    "they propose that the prolateness of the bcgs ( in particular the cds ) could reflect the shape of the associated dark matter halos ( also see smith et al .",
    "2010 ) . hence , while it is tempting to conclude that the discrepancy between mass dependent trends in simulations and theory will be alleviated if we only consider isolated halos , we note that jing & suto ( 2002 ) eliminated halos in their simulations which were not relaxed . if these had suffered recent mergers , then they may already have removed the most prolate halos from their sample .",
    "further investigation of this point is the subject of ongoing work .    despite this disagreement about the distribution of minor - to - major axis ratio",
    ", we found very good agreement between our model and the conditional minor - to - intermediate axis ratio distribution measured from simulations ( figure [ p_cbca ] ) .",
    "in particular , we showed that our model provides physical motivation for the empirical fitting formula obtained in jing & suto ( 2002 ) from numerical studies ( our equation  [ js_explain ] ) . in our model ,",
    "this distribution is closely related to the conditional prolateness distribution in the initial conditions ( section [ prolateness ] , figure  [ pro_given_eli ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , results in lam et al .",
    "( 2009 ) suggest that this distribution is unlikely to be able to discriminate between gaussian initial conditions and ones where the primordial non - gaussianity is of the ` local ' type ( i.e. rossi , chingangbam & park 2010 ) .",
    "we also discussed the agreement / disagreement between theory and numerical predictions , in the context of known problems and limitations in the modelling to difficulties in making shape measurements from simulations .",
    "we are currently studying the following improvements and extensions to our model :    1 .",
    "our model makes the extremely simple assumption that axis lengths freeze - out once they have shrunk to a sufficiently small size .",
    "subsequent violent relaxation effects associated with particles which collapse along other axes may change this size  something our current model does not consider .",
    "for instance , massive halos are expected to have assembled their mass more recently than low mass halos .",
    "therefore , relaxation effects may have had more time to change the axis ratios of low mass halos than of higher mass halos . if the net effect of this relaxation is to make the halos more spherical than they",
    "would otherwise have been , then accounting for it may help resolve the discrepancy between our model and simulations .",
    "note that halos having smaller amounts of substructures tend to be closer to virial equilibrium ( e.g. giocoli et al .",

    "the main text describes a number of inconsistencies in the work of lee et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . besides the mismatch between @xmath147 and @xmath148 ( see section  [ conditional_distributions ] ) , we also stated in the main text that their approach does not reduce to the zeldovich approximation  despite the fact that they believe it does .    to see why , note that their equation  ( 2 ) gives the usual expression for the nonlinear density in the zeldovich approximation  the same one we use .",
    "namely , if we use @xmath4 to denote the initial length of axis @xmath16 , and @xmath163 its length at a later time , then their equation  ( 2 ) comes from setting @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the eigenvalue of the initial shear tensor .",
    "note that there is _ no square root factor _ in the relation between @xmath166 and the zeldovich - evolved axis length @xmath167 .",
    "lee et al .",
    "( 2005 ) then define ( @xmath168 ) to be the eigenvalues of the inertia tensor . for a homogeneous ellipsoid with axis ratios ( @xmath169 ) , the inertia tensor eigenvalues ( @xmath168 )",
    "are related to ( @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 ) , whereas their equation  ( 7 ) sets @xmath19 equal to the square root of @xmath20 .",
    "i.e. , they have put the square root on the wrong side of the equation .",
    "therefore , their expressions will not reduce correctly to the zeldovich approximation at early times .",
    "note that their equation  ( 8) does in fact have the correct relation between the _ semi - axis lengths _ and eigenvalues ( because it has been taken correctly from equation 7.2 of bardeen et al .",
    "1986 ) . in this notation , @xmath173 where the @xmath174 are the eigenvalues of the inertia tensor , but lee et al .",
    "( 2005 ) incorrectly call ( @xmath168 ) the eigenvalues of inertial tensor , when they are in fact the _ semi - axis lengths _ ( see text above equation 7.2 of bardeen et al .",
    "however , by equation  ( 15 ) , lee et al . are referring to @xmath175 as ratios of _ axis lengths _ , rather than as ratios of _ eigenvalues_. their sloppiness about the important difference between these two gives rise to the following problem .",
    "if ( @xmath168 ) are axis lengths , then the square root factor in their equation  ( 7 ) means they will not recover the zeldovich approximation , which does not have a square root factor .",
    "if they are eigenvalues of the inertia tensor , then they have put the square root in the wrong place , so again , they will not recover the zeldovich approximation .",
    "unfortunately , jing & suto ( 2002 ) are also ambiguous about just what it is they measured .",
    "their equation  ( 5 ) shows ( @xmath168 ) as being _ axis ratios _ , whereas their text describes them as being obtained from diagonalizing the inertia tensor , hence _ eigenvalues _ ( unfortunately , they do nt say explicitly which is the square - root of the other ) .    in a subsequent study on cosmic voids , lavaux & wandelt ( 2010 ) used some erroneous definitions from lee et al .",
    "( 2005 ) but still found excellent agreement between their analytic framework and measurements from numerical simulations .",
    "this is because they where `` consistently wrong '' , in that their derived quantities measured from the simulations suffer from the same flaw present in their theory .",
    "hence , although their ellipticity definitions are incorrect , the comparison theory / simulations is still fair .",
    "we also note that the philosophy of our approach in modelling halo shapes is similar to theirs , although the details are different ( see their appendix b ) and they matter ( i.e. in particular the use of the ellipsoidal collapse barrier as in equation [ p_given_e ] , which allows one to distinguish between peaks and random positions ) .",
    "we will expand more on this important issue in a forthcoming publication ."

    "<S> we combine the physics of the ellipsoidal collapse model with the excursion set theory to study the shapes of dark matter halos . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we develop an analytic approximation to the nonlinear evolution that is more accurate than the zeldovich approximation ; we introduce a planar representation of halo axis ratios , which allows a concise and intuitive description of the dynamics of collapsing regions and allows one to relate the final shape of a halo to its initial shape ; we provide simple physical explanations for some empirical fitting formulae obtained from numerical studies . comparison with simulations is challenging , as there is no agreement about how to define a non - spherical gravitationally bound object . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we find that our model matches the conditional minor - to - intermediate axis ratio distribution rather well , although it disagrees with the numerical results in reproducing the minor - to - major axis ratio distribution . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the mass dependence of the minor - to - major axis distribution appears to be the opposite to what is found in many previous numerical studies , where low - mass halos are preferentially more spherical than high - mass halos . in our model , the high - mass halos </S>",
