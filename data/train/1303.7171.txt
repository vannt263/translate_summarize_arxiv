    "the last few decades have seen great improvements with both these issues .",
    "a number of projects have generated rich data sets for pm searches in the near - infrared ( nir ) and mid - infrared : two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ?",

    "w10@xmath053 , together with the other recently discovered nearby bds @xcite , can constrain the local bd density and offers us an opportunity to study these cool objects in detail , search for planets around them , and even resolve their surfaces with future interferometric instruments .",
    "we carried out optical spectroscopy , nir imaging , and optical polarimetry of w10@xmath053 with salt and other facilities at the saao to obtain spectral types of both components , measure their radial velocities , test if the system may belong to a nearby moving group or association , and look for the presence of scattering dust .",

    "salt makes use of an atmospheric dispersion compensator , ensuring that there were no color dependent slit losses .",
    "the pg1800 grating was used on march 12 , 2013 to measure the radial velocities because it provides the highest spectral resolution at red wavelengths , resulting in spectral coverage of 78708940  and spectral resolution of 0.97  ( 0.33  per binned pixel ) . to improve the spectral typing ,",

    "the two components of w10@xmath053 were unresolved by the instrument .",
    "no polarization was detected with a firm upper limit of 0.07% .",
    "to determine the spectral types of the two components , we created a spectral sequence of field l- and t- dwarf primary spectral standards from @xcite and @xcite , adding extra l9 @xcite , and t1 ( classified in the nir by @xcite ) templates .",
    "fig.[fig : spec_class ] shows the pg900 spectra of w10@xmath053a and b ( black ) along with various spectral templates ( purple for the primary and green for the secondary ) .",
    "our spectra were smoothed by a boxcar function to a resolution of @xmath33.3 and normalized at 8200 .",
    "the primary is best matched to l7l9 spectra and we therefore classify it as l8@xmath11 , same as @xcite .",
    "typing of the secondary is less straightforward , mainly because of the lack of reliable spectral templates of t - dwarfs in the optical .",
    "the spectrum appears to be bracketed by t1 and t2 , and we assign t1.5@xmath12 to this object .",
    "our resolved nir photometry yields colors consistent with the colors of bds with the same spectral types from the dwarf archives .",
    "@xcite presented resolved nir spectroscopy of w10@xmath053 , deriving l7.5@xmath10.9 and t0.5@xmath10.7 , for the primary and secondary , respectively , consistent with our spectral types .",
    "the measured apparent magnitudes combined with the astrometrically calibrated absolute magnitudes of @xcite yield distances for the primary and the secondary of 2.5@xmath10.3 and 2.0@xmath10.2pc , respectively . their consistency with the parallax of @xcite , together with the typical magnitudes of the components , make it unlikely to find that w10@xmath053 is a nearly - equal mass hierarchical bd system .",
    "however , the magnitudes must be treated with caution until further studies , because the photometric monitoring in i+@xmath24 by @xcite yielded a quasi - periodic ( p=4.87@xmath10.01hr ) variation of the secondary , probably produced by fast rotation and fast - changing cloud structure .",
    "we estimated the radial velocities for both components from the salt medium - resolution spectra .",
    "the two most prominent absorption lines were used , identified in both spectra as rbi at 7947.60    and csi at 8521.13    ( fig.[fig : spec ] and * ? ? ? * ) . to exclude systematic shifts originating from the known rss flexure , we calculated the line - of - sight velocity distributions along the slit using the method and programs described in @xcite where the nearest night - sky lines were used as references .",
    "the iraf task splot was used to calculate the centers of the absorption lines providing the measured radial velocities v@xmath2=23.1@xmath11.1 and 19.5@xmath11.2kms@xmath4 for components a and b , respectively .",
    "these values incorporate a heliocentric correction of 7.4kms@xmath4 , corresponding to the observing time of march 13 , 2013 , 01:14 ut .",
    "we cross - correlated the salt medium - resolution spectra of component a with component b to measure directly their relative velocity : 2.5@xmath11.9kms@xmath4 , consistent with the difference between the velocities given above : 3.6@xmath11.6kms@xmath4 .    as a double - check ,",
    "we cross - correlated the spectra of the two components with a 1400k synthetic spectrum computed with the phoenix simulator , using the bt - settl models @xcite .",
    "the cross - correlation , performed with the iraf task xcsao , yielded 22.0@xmath14.0kms@xmath4 and 18.2@xmath14.2kms@xmath4 , in excellent agreement with the values obtained above .",
    "these estimates are less reliable because the template refers to averaged parameters of both components , and they use all lines , not just the strongest ones , subjecting the cross - correlation to more noise .",
    "the observed pm of the star translates to a transverse velocity of 28.4kms@xmath4 , and the total relative velocity of the star with respect to the sun is @xmath336kms@xmath4 .",
    "linear polarization in cool sub - stellar objects is thought to arise in disks , or due to dust in their atmospheres , combined with asymmetries caused by oblateness due to fast rotation or partial cloud coverage .",
    "the theoretical models predict that these mechanisms can cause polarization of up to 0.1% in the optical @xcite .",
    "indeed , linear polarization reaching 0.21.7% in @xmath25-bands was found in some early - l bds @xcite .",
    "our upper limit of 0.07% argues against the presence of any of these polarizing mechanisms in w10@xmath053 .",
    "we assign spectral type l8@xmath11 to the primary and t1.5@xmath12 to the secondary .",
    "this classification is consistent with the nir magnitudes of the two components , excluding the possibility that w10@xmath053 is a nearly - equal mass , hierarchical bd system .    the relations between spectral type and effective temperature t@xmath26 of @xcite , yield t@xmath26@xmath27 1350(@xmath160random,@xmath1100systematic)k for the primary , and 1210(@xmath140random,@xmath1100systematic)k for the secondary .",
    "the random errors reflect the template matching , and the systematic ones reflect the calibration s rms . compared with the dusty @xcite and bt - settl @xcite theoretical 1gyr isochrones",
    ", these t@xmath26 values correspond to masses of 0.040.05m@xmath6 for the primary , and 0.030.05m@xmath6 for the secondary . at 10gyr their masses",
    "would still be in the sub - stellar regime : 0.0650.072m@xmath6 and 0.060.07m@xmath6 , respectively .",
    "an evaluation of masses based on the nir magnitudes alone yields similar ranges , albeit wider due to the larger uncertainties . with these masses and assuming a circular orbit with a radius equal to the projected separation at the parallax - derived distance , we obtain a period in the range of 14 - 20years , and an orbital velocity of 4.66.5kms@xmath4 .",
    "our relative radial velocity between the two components is 2.53.6kms@xmath4 , implying that they are indeed bound .",
    "the actual separation between them is possibly larger than the projected one or the orbit is very eccentric .    combining the measured radial velocities ( v@xmath2=23.1 @xmath11.1,19.5@xmath11.2kms@xmath4 ) with the distance and the pm from @xcite ,",
    "following @xcite , we obtain galactic velocities : @xmath28=@xmath017.8 , @xmath29= @xmath029.7 , @xmath30=@xmath06.5kms@xmath4 . these are not compatible with any known nearby moving group or stellar association , furthering the initial assessment of @xcite",
    ". in particular , the radial velocities we derive are too large by a factor of 3 to reconcile w10@xmath053 with the 40 myr - old argus group .",
    "this is not surprising , as @xcite already pointed out that the nir photometry is not compatible with such a young age .",
    "the available measurements also exclude membership into the 30 myr - old car association @xcite , unless the distance to w10@xmath053 was shortened by more than 25% ( highly unlikely ) .",
    "a search through more than half a dozen galactic velocity catalogs yielded a single close match ",

    "many of the most recent pm and radial velocity catalogs do nt include explicitly @xmath31 , so our search is not conclusive , but it indicates that w10@xmath053 most likely lacks nearby bright co - moving companions , and its age remains poorly constrained .",
