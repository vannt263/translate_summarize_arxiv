    "while photons are the ideal carriers for transporting quantum information over long distances , atoms can be used to store and process information . thus , atom - photon interfaces will be important for implementing more complex quantum information processing tasks  @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of information exchange between photonic ` flying ' qubits and atoms or similar microscopic systems requires a strong interaction between them , characterized e.g. by the scattering probability of a single photon .",
    "the traditional method to bring this probability close to unity is to place an atom into high finesse cavity  @xcite , where , in a simplified picture , a photon visits the atom many times and hence increases its chance of being scattered .",
    "recently , however , it was shown that efficient scattering can also be achieved without cavity assistance by strong focusing , localizing the field of the photon to a small region near the scatterer  @xcite . a high scattering probability of photons has been demonstrated experimentally for various microscopic systems  @xcite .    apart from the power changing aspect of the scattering process ,",
    "the presence of the single atom in a focus of the light beam can also change its phase . this may help to realize a photonic phase gate , in which the phase of a photon is changed depending on the presence or the internal state of the atom  @xcite .",
    "in such a scenario , the atom can be viewed as a mediator for photon - photon interactions due to the non - linear dispersion .",
    "this nonlinear phase shift has been investigated in experiments involving cavities  @xcite and atomic ensembles  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to perform a similar experiment with a strongly focused optical mode , because of its much reduced complexity compared to cavity qed experiments .    as a first step towards such an element ,",
    "we report here on the direct measurement of the phase shift the presence of a single @xmath0rb atom imposes on a strongly focused coherent light field in a mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "there , the probe passes only once through the atom localization volume .",
    "following  @xcite , a simple theoretical model is used to describe the experimental results .",
    "figure  [ setup ] shows a sketch of our experiment .",
    "a probe beam is sent through a stabilized mach - zehnder interferometer ( mzi ) .",
    "one arm contains a single @xmath0rb atom , trapped at the focus of a confocal aspheric lens pair ( atom arm ) in an ultra high vacuum chamber , while the other arm serves as a phase reference .     experimental setup .",
    "a single atom located by a far - off - resonant trap ( fort ) in a confocal arrangement of two aspheric lenses ( al ) is made part of a stabilized mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "refer to the text for explanation of the different components . ]",
    "the probe is a weak coherent beam with a transverse gaussian profile with a waist of @xmath2 mm at the focusing lens ( @xmath3 mm ) . during the experiment ,",
    "the frequency of the probe is tuned across the resonance of the @xmath4 transition of the d2 line ( 780 nm ) .",
    "the ratio of optical power in both arms of the interferometer is controlled with a half - wave plate and a polarizing beam - splitter to match at the input ports of the second beam - splitter without an atom in the focus .",
    "a quarter - wave plate preceeding the focusing lens prepares the probe into right circular polarization to maximize interaction with the atom  @xcite , before it is focused to a ( nominal ) waist @xmath51.0 m .",
    "after the lenses , the polarization of the probe is converted back to linear with a quarter- and half - wave plate to match the polarization of the reference arm .",
    "the output modes of the interferometer are then collected into single mode fibers with an efficiency of @xmath6 without an atom in the trap , which guide the light to silicon avalanche photodetectors ( apd ) d1 and d2 .",
    "the single @xmath0rb atom is localized at the focus of the aspheric lenses by means of a far off - resonant optical dipole trap formed by a tightly focused light beam at 980 nm , such that there is either one or no atom in the trap at any time due to the ` collisional blockade ' mechanism  @xcite .",
    "cold atoms are loaded into the dipole trap from a magneto optical trap ( mot ) , and the presence of one and only one atom in the trap is verified by observing strong photon anti - bunching in the second - order correlation function @xmath7 of the atomic fluorescence .    during the frequency scan of the probe",
    ", the atom has a probability to be excited to @xmath8 and fall to the @xmath9 ground state . to bring the atom back to the probe transition , light resonant to the @xmath10 transition of @xmath0rb ( 795 nm )",
    "is sent to the atom together with the probe beam , and later filtered out with an interference filter if .",
    "the phase stability of the interferometer over the measurement time is ensured by locking it to an off - resonant auxiliary laser with a wavelength @xmath11 nm copropagating with the probe . to ensure that a drift in the frequency of this locking laser does not change the path length difference significantly ,",
    "the mzi is adjusted close to zero path length difference with the help of a glass plate in the reference arm .",
    "this auxiliary light is separated from the probe with dichroic mirrors dm to provide a feedback signal to a piezoelectric actuator ( pzt ) .    to keep the analysis of the interference pattern simple , we aimed for a maximal interference contrast in the mzi .",
    "essential for this is a match of the wavefronts in probe- and reference arm on the second beam splitter ( bs ) .",
    "a confocal lens pair identical to the one in the probe arm was inserted in the reference arm , with an adjustable separation to compensate for any difference in divergence . the interference contrast ( after coupling into the single mode fibers ) had a visibility of @xmath12% .",
    "once an atom is loaded into the trap ( verified by detecting its fluorescence with detector d3 ) , the mot beams and quadrupole coil currents are switched off , and the atom is optically pumped into the @xmath13 closed cycling transition by the same probe beam for 20ms ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "then the detection events at d1 and d2 are recorded for 130140ms .",
    "after that , the mot beams are turned on for about 20ms to check if the atom is still in the trap .",
    "if this is the case , the mot beams are turned off again and the pump , probe and detection sequence is repeated .",
    "otherwise , the last single probe result is ignored , and the interferometer outputs are observed _ without _ an atom in the trap for 2s with the mot beams switched off as a background measurement .    since our observation is done by detectors probing the light in single mode optical fibers behind beam splitter , we can express all interference effects in terms of scalar amplitudes @xmath14 of field modes in these fibers , which in the free space part both overlap with the probe and reference mode .",

    "note that this does not imply equal count rates @xmath24 and @xmath25 of the detectors behind the single mode fibers due to the different coupling efficiencies in each channel , and different detector dark count rates .",

    "( [ phaseshift_final ] ) and the fit parameters from the transmission measurement at @xmath69 is about 2.6 times smaller than what we would expect for our focusing parameter .",
    "we amount this discrepancy to two contributions : firstly , the lenses in the experiment are not ideal , so the calculated value of @xmath57 may not reflect the actual field strength at the atom .",
    "an independent measurement of the field at the focus @xcite would help to assess this contribution quantitatively .",
    "secondly , the atom in the trap is not stationary , thus the average probe field strength that it experiences is lower than the calculated value in the focal position . with our trap frequencies of @xmath78 khz in transverse and @xmath79 khz in longitudinal direction together with the estimated temperature of the atom of @xmath80k ( as measured in similar trap configurations @xcite ) , the atom has a position uncertainty of @xmath81 nm and @xmath82 nm , respectively , reducing the scattering ratio @xmath57 by 23% @xcite .",
    "however , the scattering ratio is very sensitive to temperature of the atom , and doubling of the temperature alone would explain the discrepancy between theory and experiment .",
    "additional cooling techniques @xcite would help to reduce this contribution .",
    "in summary , we have measured the phase shift that the presence of a single @xmath0rb atom imposes on a near resonant focused light field .",
    "the theoretical model suggests that realistic experimental improvement in the focusing strength and on the atom localization to levels comparable to what is achieved in ion traps focusing quality will lead to substantial phase shifts on a light beam by a single atom . with a control of the atomic state by another photon ,",
    "this atom - light interface may form relatively simple building block in a phase gate between photonic qubits .",
