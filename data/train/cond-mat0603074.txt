    "in fig .  1 , we represent an example of the temperature behaviour of the electrical resistivity of underdoped la@xmath3sr@xmath4cuo@xmath2 .",
    "these data were taken from refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , and correspond to a bulk polycrystalline sample ( fig .",
    "1a ) and to a thin film ( fig .",
    "1b ) . in these figures",
    ", @xmath5 is the temperature where @xmath6 has its maximum ( @xmath5 is close to @xmath7 , the temperature where the measured resistivity vanishes ) , @xmath8 is the temperature at which the pseudogap in the normal state opens , and @xmath9 is the temperature at which the measured resistivity , @xmath10 , becomes indistinguishable from the background resistivity , @xmath11 .",
    "this background resistivity ( solid line in fig .",
    "1b ) is obtained by extrapolating through the transition the normal - state resistivity measured well above the superconducting transition .",
    "the details of this extrapolation procedure may be seen in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "sr@xmath4cuo@xmath2 , taken from @xcite , and ( b ) a film of the same composition and thickness @xmath12  nm , taken from @xcite . in ( b ) , the measurements correspond to the in - plane direction ( parallel to the cuo@xmath13 layers ) .",
    "the temperatures @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath5 correspond , respectively , to the pseudogap opening temperature , to the temperature where the scf effects become indistinguishable , and to the ( inflexion - point ) observed normal - superconducting transition temperature._,title=\"fig:\"]-2.5em +    -2.5em +    the difference between @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( dark region in fig .",
    "1b ) is supposed to be due to the presence of coherent cooper pairs created in the normal state by thermal fluctuations . as usual , these superconducting fluctuations ( scf ) effects may be quantified through the so - called in - plane paraconductivity , defined by @xmath14 the two questions that we will address here are : _",
    "i ) _ how @xmath15 is affected by doping ?",
    "this question may be directly answered by the experiments , independently of any theoretical approach . _",
    "ii ) _ is the observed @xmath5 a `` good '' mean - field critical temperature for the scf , even up to @xmath9 ? this second question is related to the theoretical description of the scf .",
    "we will answer it on the grounds of the gaussian - ginzburg - landau ( ggl ) approach , extended up to @xmath9 by introducing a `` total - energy '' cutoff that takes into account the limits imposed by the uncertainty principle to the shrinkage of the superconducting wave function when the temperature increases well above @xmath5.@xcite we are not going to directly address here another important ( mainly to discriminate between the existing theoretical proposals for the pseudogap@xcite ) open question : is @xmath8 the `` true '' mean - field superconducting transition temperature ?    to answer the above questions we will present measurements of the in - plane paraconductivity in la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 thin films with different sr concentrations .",
    "our experiments were detailed elsewhere.@xcite .",
    "they extend to high reduced - temperatures the earlier measurements of hikita and suzuki.@xcite other original aspect of our present work is the analysis in terms of the `` extended '' ggl approach ( other analyses by other groups of the paraconductivity at high reduced - temperatures in different htsc@xcite did not take into account the quantum effects on the scf , see also later ) .",
    "some examples of the influence of the sr content on the in - plane paraconductivity curves , @xmath16 , measured as a function of the reduced temperature , @xmath17 , are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "these data correspond to la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 thin films , of about 150  nm thickness and grown on ( 100)srtio@xmath18 substrates .",
    "other experimental details may be seen in ref.@xcite    the `` as - measured '' data of fig .  2",
    "provide a direct answer to the question stated in the title of this section : the only appreciable effects of doping on the scf is to change somewhat the slope of the @xmath19 versus @xmath20 curves in the low reduced - temperature region .",
    "we will see in the next section that these changes are associated with changes in the scf dimensionality . however , these changes manifest themselves only in the overdoped regime : as directly illustrated by the data in fig .",
    "2a , in all the temperature range of our measurements ( approximately @xmath21 ) , the data for @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which are well in the underdoped regime , agree well within the experimental uncertainties with those of the optimally - doped film ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "moreover , the results of figs .  2a to 2c show that in all the cases the scf vanish above a reduced temperature of around 0.7 , which corresponds to @xmath25 .",
    "note already here that in the underdoped compounds @xmath26 ( see also section [ seccioncuatro ] , and figs .  1 and 3 ) .",
    "these different results already suggest , therefore , that the opening of the normal - state pseudogap is not related to the coherent cooper pairs created above the superconducting transition by thermal fluctuations .",
    "sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 films with thickness @xmath12  nm and sr contents covering the underdoped ( @xmath27 ) , optimally - doped ( @xmath24 ) and overdoped ( @xmath28 ) compositions .",
    "the solid lines correspond to the best fit to those data using the ggl approach with a total - energy cutoff ( eq .  ( [ teor ] ) ) .",
    "see main text for details._,title=\"fig:\"]-3em +    -2.5em +",
    "this question is also answered in fig .  2 , where we compare the experimental paraconductivity with the ggl approach extended to high reduced - temperatures by introducing a `` total - energy '' cutoff .",
    "this cutoff takes into account the limits imposed by the uncertainty principle to the shrinkage of the superconducting wave function , associated to the coherent cooper pairs created by thermal fluctuations , when the temperature increases well above @xmath5.@xcite the paraconductivity was calculated on the grounds of this `` extended '' ggl approach by carballeira et al.@xcite the corresponding expressions for a single - layered superconductor , which is the case well adapted to la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 , is@xcite @xmath30,\\label{teor}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the reduced planck constant , e is the electron charge , @xmath32 is the superconducting cuo@xmath13 layers periodicity ( @xmath33  nm for la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 ) , @xmath34 ^ 2 $ ] is the lawrence - doniach ( ld ) parameter and @xmath35 is the superconducting coherence length amplitude in the @xmath36-direction ( perpendicular to the cuo@xmath13 layers ) .",
    "note that in calculating this expression for @xmath37 we have assumed the bcs - like value for the scf relaxation time , @xmath38 ( for more details see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "the solid lines in fig .",
    "2 are the best fits of eq .",
    "( [ teor ] ) to the data points , with @xmath35 and @xmath39 , the reduced - temperature where @xmath16 vanishes , as the only free parameters .",
    "sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 between the temperatures of the pseudogap opening ( @xmath8 ) , of the vanishing of the in - plane paraconductivity ( @xmath9 ) , and of the normal - superconducting transition as observed in the resistivity measurements ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the @xmath8 values are taken from the compilation in ref .",
    "@xcite , and correspond to resistivity measurements ( @xmath40 ) , hall coefficient measurements ( @xmath41 ) , infrared measurements ( @xmath42 ) , and static susceptibility measurements ( @xmath43)_,title=\"fig:\"]-2.5em +    -2.5em +    as may be observed in these figures , for all the samples the agreement between eq .",
    "( [ teor ] ) and the experimental data is excellent , in the entire studied @xmath44-region .",
    "the central result here is that this comparison strongly suggests then that the observed @xmath29 is a `` good '' mean - field transition temperature for the measured scf .",
    "this comparison also confirms the existence of a well - defined reduced - temperature , @xmath39 , of around 0.7 , above which the in - plane paraconductivity vanishes .",
    "taking into account the experimental uncertainties,@xcite this value matches fairly well the value @xmath45 which may be roughly estimated on the grounds of the uncertainty principle , the mean - field @xmath44-dependence of the in - plane coherence length , and the bcs relationship between the pippard and the ginzburg - landau coherence lengths.@xcite moreover , by comparing the obtained values of @xmath35 , which are given in the corresponding figures , with @xmath32 , it is easy to conclude that in the underdoped and optimally doped samples the scf have a 2d-3d crossover around @xmath46 .",
    "in contrast , the scf in the overdoped compounds are 2d in almost all the accessible @xmath44-region .",
    "the main conclusions of the experimental results and analyses presented here may be summarized as follows :    * a model - independent conclusion : * the general behaviour of the in - plane paraconductivity is _ not _ affected , even up to @xmath9 , by doping .",
    "the scf effects in la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 thin films seem to be not related to the pseudogap .    * from the comparison of the measured paraconductivity with the `` extended '' ggl approach : * _ i ) _ the measured @xmath5 is a good mean - field critical temperature for the ggl approach . _",
    "ii ) _ both the relaxation time of the scf and the reduced temperature , @xmath39 , where the scf vanish , are doping - independent and they take values close to those of bcs superconductors .",
    "this last result demands further studies .",
    "the independence of the scf and the pseudogap seems to be confirmed when three characteristic temperatures , @xmath5 , @xmath9 and @xmath8 , are compared .",
    "this is done in fig .  3 , where the doping dependence of @xmath5 , @xmath9 and @xmath8 is represented .",
    "the data for @xmath8 where taken from ref .",
    "this figure illustrates that in the underdoped la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 superconductors not only @xmath5 but also @xmath9 is much lower than @xmath8 and that the doping behaviour of both @xmath5 and @xmath9 is very different from the one of @xmath8 .",
