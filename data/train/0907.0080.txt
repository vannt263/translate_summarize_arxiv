    "that the vbs state in both systems are stable against the dm perturbation indicates that they are of the same kind .",
    "our results also imply the irrelevance to the haldane gap of the @xmath37 term in the aklt model , since the nearest - neighbored dm term can not be gauged away due to that term and the spin gap is still robust .",

    "the small value of the @xmath51 indicates that the vbs state is very vulnerable when competing with the antiferromagnetic state , that serves an good example to explain the current theoretical difficulty that it is very difficult to construct a pure local quantum spin model to host the vbs state as the ground state .",
    "now , we would like to examine if this vbs state is also at the weak side when competing with the dm interaction ? in the transition metal oxides , it is quite common that the inversion symmetry is not exactly preserved .",

    "the hamiltonian is given by the following @xmath52 let us call it the qd model and work in the square lattice . to perform the calculation , the specific configuration of the @xmath53 is needed . here",

    "the first one is referred to the singlet excitation , and the latter one is the triplet excitation .",

    "let us briefly comment about the introduction of the @xmath78term in the qd model , namely the qjd model .",
    "due to the reduction of the spin gap by the dm interaction , we can imagine that the quantum phase transition from the vbs state to the afm state in the qj model should happen at smaller @xmath79 in the qjd model . however , whether or not the quantum phase transition is still of the second order type remains further study .",
    "we remark that it is not an easy task , because the minus - sign problem returns in the qjd model , as the qj model is free of that problem .",
    "unfortunately , it is not appropriate to apply the lanczos method to study the qjd model .",
    "since it requires a larger system to see the finite - sized scaling to locate the transition point , the size that the lanczos method can reach is not enough .",
    "in this paper , we have apply dmrg method and the lanczos method to compute the spin gap in the aklt model and the qd model with the dm interaction . in both systems ,",
    "the spin gap of the vbs state is stable against the dm perturbation .",
    "the quantum phase transition does not occur until the pure dm model is reached .",
    "albeit the vbs state is difficult to obtain both experimentally and theoretically , our results show positively that the vbs state will not be destroyed by the dm interaction which is very common in the transition metal oxides or similar chemical families .",
    "we understand that our result is different from the vbs state of the heisenberg model in the kagome lattice , where at @xmath80 the transition from the vbs to the dm ground state occurs",
    ". however , the ground state of the heisenberg model in the kagome lattice has not reach consensus yet .",
    "moreover , the vbs state in the frustrated lattice could be very different from the one in the bipartite lattice .",
    "therefore , our results do not cause inconsistency with previous results .    to extend the current research , it is interesting to find out the nature of the quantum phase transition from the vbs state to the dm ground state . as it is shown in the ref[@xcite ] , it is the kosterlitz - thouless - type transition in the heisenberg model in the spin chain .",
    "although we expect the same result in the aklt model , the one in the qd model will be interesting ."

    "<S> the quantum phase transition does not occur until d / q goes to infinity , where d is the strength of the dm interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the vbs in the alkt model and the haldane gap system also exhibit the same property .    </S>",
    "<S> valence bond solid ( vbs ) is the array of singlets that all the antiferromagnetic spins are paired statically with one of their nearest - neighbor spins in the real space . </S>",
    "<S> it preserves the spin rotational symmetry because all spins are paired in singlets and consequently the total magnetization is zero . </S>",
    "<S> since the spins do not change their pairing partners , those singlets usually form a periodic array that breaks the translational symmetry in addition to the lattice symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> its `` liquid phase '' , usually recognized as the resonating valence bond ( rvb)@xcite , restores the translational symmetry by forming the dynamical singlets that spins can change their pairing partners dynamically with the infinite or the short range pairing strength . </S>",
    "<S> both of them have attracted great attention to the condensed matter physicists because of their unusual ground state and the excitation properties . </S>",
    "<S> vbs usually accompanies with a spin gap by breaking one pair of singlets . </S>",
    "<S> the rvb , on the other hand , often requires the critical spin correlation , and interestingly the fundamental excitations may carry the fractional quantum number .    albeit they are immensely interesting , pure spin models to host them as the ground state is not easy to construct , especially in the dimensions greater than one . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , their ground state as well as the excitation properties are not yet well understood . </S>",
    "<S> part of the reasons is that the antiferromagnetic energy often dominates when competing with the vbs and the rvb states . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the ground state favors the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) state rather than the vbs or the rvb states .    </S>",
    "<S> since we are interested in the properties of the vbs , the model hamiltonians to host it as the ground state are necessary . </S>",
    "<S> the easiest way to realize the vbs ground state is the one - dimensional spin peierls system , where a soft lattice is required as well as the strong spin - lattice interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the spin peierls system does not serve our satisfaction , because we are looking for the vbs state from a pure spin model with low spin quantum number at best . </S>",
    "<S> another possible system with the vbs ground state in one dimension is the haldane gap system , namely the heisenberg model with integer spins . </S>",
    "<S> one realization of the haldane gap system is the aklt model@xcite described by the following hamiltonian @xmath1 , \\label{eq : aklt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",

    "<S> recently , sandvik@xcite proposed a ring - exchange - like model and considered the quantum phase transition between the vbs and the afm , described by the following hamiltonian @xmath6 where @xmath7 denote the nearest neighbor spins and @xmath8 are the coordinates of a plaquette with the counterclockwise or the clockwise order </S>",
    "<S> . we shall call it qj model in the rest of the paper . using this model </S>",
    "<S> , sandvik found that a second order quantum phase transition from the vbs state to the afm state take place at @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this small ratio of @xmath10 indicates that the vbs state is indeed vulnerable to the afm perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> another model that might host the vbs ground state is the heisenberg model in the kagome lattice@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> numerical calculation showed that it is a vbs with 36-site unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> although the final verdict of the ground state of the heisenberg model in the kagome lattice is still under debate , this model is worth mentioning , because it relates to the zncu@xmath11(oh)@xmath12cl@xmath13 that shows no spin ordering down to tens of the mk as well as the absence of the spin gap down to 0.1mev@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of the spin ordering is also one of the important properties of the vbs state . </S>",
    "<S> however , since there is a spin gap in the vbs system , the heisenberg model can not fully describe the material .    in this paper , we study the dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) perturbation in the vbs state . </S>",
    "<S> part of the motivation was enlightened by the experimental fact that vbs systems often occur in the lattice with low crystal symmetry for example the ni(c@xmath13h@xmath14n@xmath13)@xmath13no@xmath13(clo@xmath15 ) ( nenp ) for the haldane gap system and the zncu@xmath11(oh)@xmath12cl@xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> especially , if the inversion symmetry is absence , the dm interaction is often inevitable . </S>",
    "<S> another motivation is tempted by the study of zncu@xmath11(oh)@xmath12cl@xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> further numerical study had considered the addition of the dm perturbation to the heisenberg model in the kagome lattice . because the kagome lattice does not have the inversion center , the dm interaction must play some role in this material . </S>",
    "<S> esr measurement detect the strength of the dm interaction is roughly 0.08j@xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> theoretical study @xcite suggests that there is a quantum phase transition from the vbs state to the afm state at @xmath16 </S>",
    "<S> . if it is true , the vbs state would be also as vulnerable against the dm perturbation as well as the afm one . </S>",
    "<S> regardless the inconsistency of their results with previous studies that strikes our understanding of zncu@xmath11(oh)@xmath12cl@xmath13 , the question `` does the vulnerability of the vbs by the dm interaction also happen in other vbs systems ? </S>",
    "<S> '' has its own weight , which will be addressed in this paper .    to get the general understanding to that question </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the vbs states in the aklt and the qd models , where the qd model is meant by letting j = 0 and adding the dm term in the qj model . </S>",
    "<S> these two models are chosen , because they are of the low - spin models and there is almost no doubt that the ground state in these two models is the vbs state . our results , on the contrary , show the stability of the vbs states against the dm interaction in those two models . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum phase transition does not occur at any finite @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> we computed the spin gap and found that it does not close until d / q in the qd model ( or d / j in the aklt model ) goes to infinity , where @xmath17 is the strength of the dm interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> our results are consistent with the previous study of the xxz heisenberg model of spin one . </S>",
    "<S> consider the haldane gap system with the dm interaction @xmath18 if we choose @xmath19 , eq.([eq : haldane+dm ] ) becomes @xmath20,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> it implies that the dm term can be gauged away and maps to the xxz heisenberg model @xmath22 with @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , the so(3 ) symmetry is explicitly broken to u(1 ) for a finite @xmath17 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , one might expect that the quantum phase transition to the xy - phase might occur at some @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> however , numerical study@xcite showed that the quantum phase transition , which is shown to be of the kosterlitz - thouless type , does not happen until @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , only infinitely strong dm interaction can close the spin gap and destroy the vbs state . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , very unlike the vulnerability of the questionable vbs state in the heisenberg model in the kagome lattice , the possible vbs state in the haldane gap system is very stable against the dm interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the key lies in the coincidence that the dm term can be gauged away and the spin gap is robust at any finite @xmath26 in the xxz heisenberg model .    </S>",
    "<S> since the aklt model was proposed to realized the haldane gap , we expect that the same results will happen , and indeed it is . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine the vbs state in the qd model and find the same stability . </S>",
    "<S> one might speculate that the vulnerability of the vbs in the heisenberg model in the kagome lattice might be due to the incapability of the dm interaction to be gauged away . in the aklt and the qd model , </S>",
    "<S> the dm interaction can not be gauged away either . </S>",
    "<S> if the vbs state in the heisenberg model in the kagome lattice is proven to be true by more detail examination , our results may imply that the vbs state in that case is very different from the ones we study here . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , this exercise might shed light on the characterization of the vbs states .    a simple - minded explanation of these results can be understood as the following . </S>",
    "<S> consider the case that there are only two spins with the interaction @xmath27 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state of this case is the singlet state with the energy @xmath28 , and the excited state is the triplet with the energy @xmath29 . introducing the dm interaction of @xmath19 rearranges the eigenvalues to be @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> two unaffected states are @xmath31 and @xmath32 in the triplet . </S>",
    "<S> it is obvious to see that introducing any finite @xmath17 does not cause level crossing . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the spin gap does not close at any finite @xmath17 value disconnects the one for the finite d , since in the former case @xmath33 can be take to be zero ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we organize this paper in the following way . </S>",
    "<S> in the section [ section : aklt ] , we applied the dmrg method to compute the spin gap as the function of d / j in the aklt plus dm interaction . in section [ section : qd ] , we use the lanczos method to compute the spin gap in the qd model mentioned above . </S>",
