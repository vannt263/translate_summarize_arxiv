    "in the past several years , surveys of hypervelocity stars ( hvss ) have found 16 hvss with velocities substantially higher than the galactic escape velocity @xcite .",
    "most hvss are b - type stars probably with masses @xmath0 , ages @xmath1  yr , and lifetime @xmath2  yr @xcite .",
    "their heliocentric distances range from several ten to a hundred kpc and their spatial distribution on the sky is probably anisotropic @xcite .",
    "the young nature and the spatial anisotropic distribution of these stars , as well as their hypervelocities , should be related to their origin .",
    "a few dynamical mechanisms , involving interactions with the massive black hole ( mbh ) in the galactic center ( gc ) , were proposed to eject stars with such hyper velocities @xcite , including tidal breakup of binary star systems by the central mbh and three - body interactions of single stars with a hypothetical binary black hole ( bbh ) in the gc .",
    "the sources of ( binary ) stars injected into the vicinity of the mbh are often ( implicitly ) assumed to be isotropically distributed in previous studies , as the majority of the gc stars are isotropically distributed ; and different ejection mechanisms may result in different spatial distributions of hvss , depending on whether the central mbh is a single or a binary and relevant binary parameters @xcite .",
    "hence , the spatial distribution of hvss was proposed to be useful in identifying the ejection mechanism responsible for the observed hvss .",
    "the progenitors of the discovered b - type young hvss and their sources , however , should be distinct populations from the majority of the gc stars ( which are typically old ) .",
    "observations have indeed shown various young stellar structures in the gc , which may be possible parent populations of the hvs progenitors , including a clockwise young stellar disk ( cws ) and the other possible counterclockwise one within @xmath3  pc from the central mbh @xcite , young stellar clusters like the arches and the quintuplet systems at several ten pc away from the center , and the tidal remnants of those clusters @xcite .",
    "there also exist other organized structures in the gc , such as , the circumnuclear molecular disk , the northern arm ( narm ) and the bar components of the minispiral at a few pc from the center , with which young stars may be associated @xcite .",
    "these structures may also be related to the sources of hvss .",
    "all the structures above are not isotropically distributed , but either planar or orbiting on some specific planes around the central mbh .",
    "the hvss , if ejected by interactions of stars originating from these sources with the central mbh(s ) , are very likely to be spatially correlated . and their spatial distribution should be mapping the distribution of the parent populations of their progenitors , if the ejected hvss can well memorize the injecting direction of their progenitors .",
    "this paper is organized as following . in   [ sec : deflection ] , we study how the spatial distribution of hvss is related with the geometrical structure of the parent population of their progenitors . in   [ sec : obsconst ] we find that most hvss discovered so far are probably originated from the clockwise young stellar disk ( cws ) or a disk - like stellar structure with an orientation similar to that of the cws disk in the gc .",
    "discussion and conclusions are given in ",
    "[ sec : disc ] and   [ sec : con ] .",
    "in this section , we use both analytical analysis and numerical calculations to demonstrate that hvss can well memorize the injecting direction of their progenitors .",
    "we do this for different possible dynamical mechanisms of ejecting hvss introduced in   [ sec : intro ] .",
    "if a binary star initially unbound or weakly bound to the central mbh approaches the vicinity of the mbh within a tidal distance @xmath4 , the binary is probably tidally broken up , and one component of the binary may be ejected as a hvs , where @xmath5 is the mass of the central mbh [ @xmath6 , @xcite ] , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the mass of the ejected hvs and the other binary component , respectively , and @xmath9 is the semi - major axis of the binary @xcite . the initial injecting velocity of the binary is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the gravitational constant , and then the velocity of the ejected hvs can be approximated by @xcite @xmath12 the orbit of the ejected hvs and the initial orbit of the injecting binary both have eccentricities @xmath13 close to 1 and can be approximated as rectilinear at distances faraway from the mbh .",
    "below we aim to find out the range of the deflection angle of these two rectilinear directions .    for convenience ,",
    "we first consider a purely two - body problem that a star with mass @xmath14(@xmath15 ) starts at a velocity @xmath16 from infinity and is moving towards the mbh on a hyperbolic orbit with periapsis distance @xmath17 .",
    "the velocity of the star at periapsis is @xmath18 , and then the deflection angle of its direction from its initial injecting velocity is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 .",
    "if the star moves towards the mbh on a parabolic or elliptical orbit with eccentricity close to 1 , the deflection angle of the stellar velocity moving from almost the infinity ( excluding locations near the apoapsis ) to the periapsis @xmath21 is about @xmath22 .",
    "similarly as above , for a star that can escape the bh with velocity @xmath23 , the deflection angle of the escaping star from its velocity at @xmath21 is @xmath24 with @xmath25 . for the hvss discovered so far , we have @xmath26 obtained by removing the velocity deceleration due to the galactic potential measured by @xcite .",
    "note that the relative change of the eccentricity vector ( pointing towards the periapsis from the mbh ) is @xmath27 and it is negligible compared to @xmath28 for sufficiently small @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the change of the velocity of the binary component ejected as the hvs after the binary breakup . for the process of tidal breakup of a binary star at a distance of @xmath30 from the mbh , we approximately have @xmath31 , and the total deflection angle @xmath32 of the ejected hvs from the original injecting binary is about @xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath32 is @xmath34 if the hvs and the injecting binary are on the same orbital plane and @xmath35 for @xmath36 . for @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39",
    ", we have @xmath40 , that is , the hvss are almost reversing the injecting direction of their progenitors .    to confirm the above analysis",
    ", we numerically realize the process of ejecting an hvs as a binary interacts with a mbh .",
    "we use an explicit 5(4)-order runge - kutta scheme to integrate the full three - body problem @xcite . in the three - body simulations , we first assume that all binary stars initially move on hyperbolic orbits with @xmath41 from infinity . in the calculations we set other relevant parameters as follows : ( 1 ) the distribution of the semi - major axes @xmath42 of binary stars is assumed to follow @xmath43 as suggested by observations of binaries with o - type or b - type primary stars @xcite",
    ". the lower limit of @xmath42 is roughly set to @xmath44 , i.e. , about twice the physical radius of a @xmath45 star ; and the upper limit of @xmath42 is set to @xmath46 to ensure the ejected star can escape to large galactic radii .",
    "( 2 ) the mass distribution of primary stars @xmath47 follows the miller - scalo initial mass function , i.e. , @xmath48 and @xmath49 @xcite . for massive binary stars ,",
    "the distribution of the secondary star or the mass ratio @xmath50 can be described by two populations : ( a ) a twin population , i.e. , about @xmath51 binary stars have @xmath52 or @xmath53 , and ( b ) the rest binaries follow a @xmath54 constant distribution @xcite . ( 3 ) the eccentricity of the binary star is assumed to be @xmath55 . ( 4 ) the orientation of the binary orbital plane is randomly chosen .",
    "( 5 ) the probability distribution of the closest approach distances to the mbh is @xmath56 , which corresponds to the impact parameter distribution @xmath57 .",
    "we only select those cases that the masses of ejected stars are in the mass range @xmath58 of the observed hvss and calculate the probability distribution of their deflection angles @xmath32 .",
    "as seen from panel a of figure  [ fig : f1 ] , the values of @xmath32 range from @xmath59 to @xmath60 , consistent with our analysis above .",
    "the distribution of @xmath32 does not show dependence on @xmath61 .",
    "the reason for this independence is as follows .",
    "if the mass of the central mbh ( here the mbh in the gc ) and the mass of an hvs are fixed , @xmath61 is primarily determined by the semi - major axis of the binary , and given @xmath62 , @xmath63 is independent of @xmath9 and hence @xmath61 .",
    "we also calculate the deflection angle distribution for the case that the injected binary stars are initially on weakly bound and highly eccentric orbits , instead of unbound orbits . in this case , the only difference in the initial conditions from that for initially unbound binaries is as follows : the apoapsis distribution of the orbit of the binary barycenter follows @xmath64 , @xmath65 is in the range @xmath66 , and the distribution of the closest approach @xmath21 , i.e. , the periapsis distance of the orbit of the binary barycenter , is the same as above .",
    "the above distribution of the apoapsis is adopted so that the energy distribution of the binaries injected from a disk structure is consistent with the density distribution of young stellar disk recently discovered in the gc @xcite .",
    "the radial distribution of stars within the young stellar disk plane is @xmath67 in @xcite and @xmath68 in @xcite .",
    "the resulted distribution of @xmath32 is shown in panel b of figure  [ fig : f1 ] .",
    "and @xmath32 is also in the range from @xmath59 to @xmath60 , which again confirms our analysis above that hvss memorize the direction of their original binaries well .",
    "hvss can also be produced by three - body interactions of a single star with a hard bbh .",
    "a bbh is hard if its semi - major axis @xmath69 is less than @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the stellar velocity dispersion of the host galaxy and @xmath72 is the mass of the secondary black hole . for a hard bbh , most low - angular - momentum stars that can enter into the region @xmath73",
    "will be ejected after one or several encounters with the bbh and the r.m.s . of the velocities of the ejected stars at",
    "infinity is @xmath74 [ see eq .  1 in @xcite ] , where @xmath75 is the mass of the primary black hole , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "unless the eccentricity of the bbh is excited to an extremely high value shown in some numerical simulations @xcite , the bbh can stay at its hard stage for a long time ( e.g. , up to @xmath80  yr in @xcite ) and ejection of hvss from the gc would last that long .",
    "a bbh with an extremely high eccentricity has a much shorter lifetime due to gravitation radiation , which is substantially smaller than the travel time span ( @xmath81  yr ) of the observed hvss .    in this mechanism ,",
    "hvss are ejected out from distances @xmath82 , and we have @xmath83 . if @xmath84 , we have @xmath85 , and thus hvss have lost their memory of the direction of their progenitors and the information of the bbh orbital plane may be imprinted on the spatial distribution of hvss .",
    "current observational constraints on the mass of the secondary bh in the gc gives @xmath86 @xcite , for which we have @xmath87 .",
    "if the progenitor of the hvs is unbound to the bbh with small initial velocities , it is ejected out generally after one or a few close encounters with the bbh , and we have @xmath88 . for @xmath89 , we have @xmath90 . if the injecting star is initially on a bound ( and highly eccentric ) orbit , it may be ejected out as a hvs after many times of encounters with the bbh , and the accumulated relative change of the eccentricity vector is @xmath91 and negligible for sufficiently small @xmath28 . in this case",
    "the total deflection angle @xmath32 of the ejected hvs from the injecting direction of its progenitor is thus @xmath92 , and thus hvss may have a good memory of the direction of their progenitors .",
    "we do numerical experiments on three - body interactions between single stars and a bbh with @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 , where the two bhs are set to be sufficiently close so that they are able to eject stars with the observed hypervelocities .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : f2 ] , the deflection angles @xmath32 obtained from the calculations range from @xmath59 to @xmath60 , no matter whether the injecting stars are initially unbound ( panel a in fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] ) or weakly bound ( i.e. , highly eccentric ) orbits ( panel b in fig .  [ fig : f2 ] ) .",
    "the result is not sensitive to the bbh eccentricity and @xmath69 .",
    "hypervelocity stars may also be produced by interactions of a single star with a stellar - mass black hole in the vicinity of the central mbh . in this case",
    "the velocity kick @xmath96 received by the star when it passes by the stellar - mass black hole is typically larger and comparable to the orbital velocity of the stellar mass black hole @xmath97 and thus the deflection angle deviates from @xmath98 substantially larger than that for the cases discussed above .",
    "therefore , it may be difficult for the hvss produced by this mechanism to memorize the direction of their progenitors and hence difficult to explain the consistence of the hvs plane and the cws plane shown in   [ sec : obsconst ] below",
    ".    additional deflection of the moving direction of hvss may be introduced if the galactic potential is substantially flattened or triaxial ; but this deflection , typically @xmath99 for @xmath100 , is negligible @xcite .    in summary , it is plausible to use the spatial distribution of hvss _ unbound _ to the galactic potential to map the parent population of their progenitors and reveal their origin if the hvss are produced by the tidal breakup of binary stars or the bbh mechanism .",
    "figure  [ fig : f3 ] shows the spatial distribution of all ( 16 ) hvss detected so far ( _ filled circles _ ) in the galactic coordinates by a hammer - aitoff projection .",
    "the spatial distribution of these hvss is anisotropic at a 3.5-@xmath71 level @xcite and the majority of the hvss are located at galactic longitudes @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "the projection of other various planar structures in the gc are also plotted in the figure .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : f3 ] , most hvss ( 11 among 16 ) situate close to the plane of the clockwise young stellar disk ; and a second group , including 4 other hvss and possibly a specific one among the above eleven , situate close to the narm plane . only one hvs , i.e. , he 0437 - 5439 , is neither on the cws plane nor on the narm plane , which was suggested to be ejected from the lmc @xcite .",
    "almost all hvss are quite far away from the planes of other structures plotted in the figure .",
    "we use the @xmath102 statistic to fit the possible planar structures of the hvss .",
    "the normal @xmath103 to the best - fit plane of the hvss is obtained by minimizing @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) , where @xmath106 is the unit position vector of the @xmath107-th hvs seen from the gc and @xmath108 is its possible deviation from an original plane for which we take equivalently as the error of @xmath106 in standard statistics . as the thickness ( half - opening angle ) of the cws plane",
    "is @xmath109 @xcite and the deviation angles of ejected hvss from the direction of their parent population should be about @xmath110 , we set the amount of @xmath108 correspondingly to a deviation of @xmath111 .",
    "thus , we obtain the normal of the best - fit plane of the eleven hvss @xmath112 with @xmath113 , where @xmath114 gives the probability of @xmath102 being higher by chance and it is high enough so that the fit is acceptable .",
    "we take the error of the fitted normal direction as @xmath115 and @xmath116 , which roughly correspond to the 68% confidence level .",
    "the normal of the cws disk plane , or at least the normal of the cws disk in the inner region ( 0.8 - 3.5 ) , @xmath117 , @xcite are within the error range . for the secondary group of five hvss",
    ", we obtain @xmath118 with @xmath119 , and @xmath120 correspond to the 68% confidence level .",
    "the normal to the observed narm plane @xmath121 @xcite is at the 80% confidence level of the best - fit value .",
    "@xcite recently reported that the outer part of the cws disk may be significantly warped and the normal of the warped part is @xmath122 .",
    "this normal is close to the normal of the narm plane as shown in figure  [ fig : f4 ] , which suggests some physical connection between the narm and the outer warped part of the cws disk .",
    "the normal of the outer warped part of the cws disk is at the 99.9% confidence level of the best fit . compared with the plane of the narm ,",
    "statistically the plane defined by the normal of the warped part of the cws disk is less likely to be consistent with the fitted plane of the second population of hvss .",
    "it is worthy to note that there are four other hvs candidates listed in @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : f4 ] , two of them ( sdss j1403 + 1450 and sdss j1546 + 2437 ) are within @xmath123 to the cws plane and the other two ( sdss j0940 + 5309 and sdss j1014 + 5631 ) are within @xmath124 to the narm plane .",
    "if they are confirmed to be hvss and included in the fit , the normals to the two best - fit planes are @xmath125 with @xmath126 and @xmath127 with @xmath128 , consistent with the planar structures fitted above .",
    "even for the eight bound `` hypervelocity '' stars listed in @xcite , four of them are close to the cws disk within 15@xmath129 , so are three of them to the narm plane ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : f4 ] ) . after including them , the normals to the two best - fit planes",
    "are @xmath130 with @xmath131 and @xmath132 with @xmath133 , respectively .",
    "as seen from figure  [ fig : f5 ] , after including the hvs candidates and the bound ones , the planar structure close to the cws disk appears more obvious as their locations extend to a wider area in the sky .",
    "only one object among the bound sample , sdss j1404 + 3522 , with the smallest galactocentric distance , is significantly separate from the above two planes .",
    "we note here that the bound population of `` hypervelocity '' stars are more likely to be contaminated by the high - velocity stars produced by other mechanisms as they have substantially smaller velocities than the unbound stars .",
    "we have also tested that the fits can not be passed statistically if choosing other observed structures , such as , the bar , the circumnuclear molecular disk or the counter clockwise - rotating disk .",
    "the fit can not be passed , either , by fitting all the stars to one best orientation .",
    "assuming that the parent population of the observed hvss are on the two fitted disks with a thickness of @xmath111 and normal of @xmath134 and @xmath135 , we simulate the process of tidal breakup of binary stars around the central mbh using similar initial conditions as that in   [ sec : deflection ] .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : f5 ] , the spatial distribution of the simulated hvss can well match the distribution of observed hvss .",
    "similar spatial distribution can also be reproduced if the bbh ejection mechanism is alternatively adopted . for simplicity",
    ", we do not present that in details .",
    "as we have demonstrated above , the spatial distribution of the discovered hvss is consistent with being located on two thin disk planes , and these two planes are consistent with that of the ( inner ) cws disk , and the narm or the outer warped part of the cws disk , respectively .",
    "we discuss two possible explanations to these results below .",
    "one explanation could be that the hvss are originated from some unknown and previously existed disk - like stellar structures with orientation similar to that of the cws disk , and the narm or the outer warped part of the cws disk .",
    "if this is true , one needs to answer what and where the unknown structures are , why their structures are consistent with the cws and narm ( or the warped outer part of the cws disk ) , and whether the consistency is coincident or some natural outcome .",
    "the other explanation is that most hvss are originated from the cws disk and a second population of hvss may be originated from the narm or the outer warped part of the cws disk . for this explanation , the young cws disk should persist or be frequently rejuvenated over the past @xmath136  yr as constrained by the travel time of these hvss [ @xmath137  yr ] , which is extremely puzzling .",
    "the ages of the ob stars in the disk are only @xmath138  myr .",
    "as the in - situ formation of the cws stellar disk is already difficult due to the suppression of star formation by the mbh tidal field @xcite , how have young stars been continuously forming in the disk and in the meantime how can the disk plane maintain its direction ?",
    "one key to solve this puzzle would be continuous sinking of cold gas onto the cws disk .",
    "however , the observed gaseous structures located just outside the cws disk generally do not have the same direction as the disk .",
    "solutions to this puzzle will provide profound insights to the gas fueling into the vicinity of the central mbh in the gc and mbhs in other galactic nuclei in general .",
    "detailed studies of physical properties of hvss ( e.g. , metallicity ) and their relations with those in the cws stellar disk may also help to unveil the secret of their star formation .",
    "it appears that the counter - clockwise disk is not correlated with the currently discovered hvss .",
    "the current observed b - types in the cws disk region are also more isotropic than the o / wr stars @xcite , which appears not to be the same as the planar distribution of hvss .",
    "the correlation between the observed hvss and the cws disk plane may suggest that ( 1 ) only the b - type stars on the disk plane can be perturbed to inject into the immediate vicinity of the central mbh as the progenitors of hvss ( e.g. , by secular evolution of the disk , see @xcite ) ; and ( 2 ) b - type stars initially formed on the disk may be heated up by relaxation processes later .",
    "detailed study of this relation may provide some constraints / hints on the mechanism to deliver stars to the vicinity of the central mbh .",
    "it is worthy to further explore how the orbits of ( binary ) stars in the cws and the young stellar structure associated with the narm plane or the outer warped part of the cws disk are perturbed so that they can move to the immediate vicinity of the central mbh(s ) .",
    "this perturbation may be due to some massive perturbers @xcite or secular evolution of the structures themselves @xcite .",
    "perturbations on other young stellar structures , such as the tidal streams of young stellar clusters like the arches and the quintuplet systems , may also inject ( binary ) stars to the immediate vicinity of the central mbh(s ) and lead to ejection of hvss .",
    "therefore , there may be other planar - like spatial distribution of young hvss .",
    "if these could be found in future hvs surveys , together with those found so far , the spatial distribution of hvss will be mapping young stellar structures ever existed in the gc over the past @xmath139  yr . with more and more hvss to be discovered in the all - sky survey in the future ,",
    "the statistical methods on how to extract the stellar structures would need to be improved and the detailed improvement method should depend on how complicated or simple the structures would be .",
    "one natural prediction of the hvs origination proposed above is that some b - type hvss exist close to the cws disk plane and the narm plane or the outer warped part of the cws disk in the _ southern _ hemisphere , which should be a crucial check by future hvs surveys .",
    "if old - population hvss can be detected , their spatial distribution may be different from those shown in figure  [ fig : f3 ] , as the parent population of their progenitors may be significantly isotropic than that of the discovered b - type hvss . studying the spatial distribution of different types of hvss may help to reveal information on the star formation and the dynamical environment in the gc .",
    "using both analytical arguments and numerical simulations , we have demonstrated that hvss can well memorize the injecting directions of their progenitors . in another words ,",
    "the ejecting direction of an hvs is almost anti - parallel to the injecting direction of its progenitor .",
    "therefore , the spatial distribution of hvss should map the spatial distribution of the parent population of their progenitors directly .",
    "we also find that most of the discovered hvss are spatially consistent with being located on two thin disk planes .",
    "the orientation of one plane is consistent with that of the ( inner ) cws disk , which suggests that most of the hvss originate from it or a disk - like stellar structure with a similar orientation to it .",
    "the rest of hvss may be correlated with the plane of the northern arm of the mini - spiral in the gc or the plane defined by the outer warped part of the cws disk .",
    "our results not only support the gc origin of hvss but also imply that the central disk ( or the disk structure with a similar orientation ) should persist or be frequently rejuvenated over the past 200 myr , which adds a new challenge to the stellar disk formation and provides insights to the longstanding problem of gas fueling into massive black holes .",
