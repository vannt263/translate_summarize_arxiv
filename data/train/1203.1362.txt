    "@xcite these results suggest that any model to explain the nature of the sc gap symmetry of lifeas should take into account the effects of impurity scattering .    to extract information on the gap symmetry from the specific heat of lifeas , we consider two typical unconventional sc gap models that represent two extreme limits , i.e. , a d - wave sc gap with nodes and a @xmath3s - wave gap without nodes , and fit the experimental data in fig.2 .",

    "a pure d - wave superconductor is expected to produce a @xmath14-linear specific heat coefficient such as @xmath62 because of the v - shaped density of state ( dos ) @xmath63",
    ". however , the large value of @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) indicates a substantial amount of unitary impurities .",

    "our experimental data , however , show @xmath68 , implying that the low energy dos should have the form @xmath69 .",
    "this type of constant @xmath70 v - shape dos was indeed predicted for a @xmath3s - wave gap with unitary impurities .  @xcite",
    "as can be seen in fig.2 and its inset , the @xmath3s - wave gap model with unitary impurities provide an excellent fit at low temperatures as well as for the overall shape of @xmath61 , but the d - wave model fails to explain the low temperature behavior .",

    "@xcite    a sub - linear magnetic field dependence of @xmath86 is displayed in fig .  4 , which is often taken as evidence for a nodal gap structure such as a d - wave state that is known to have a generic @xmath87 dependence due to doppler effects of the nodal quasiparticles by the supercurrent circulating around the vortices .",

    "it is clear that the @xmath3s - wave model equally well reproduces the field dependence of @xmath16 which has been taken as a signature for a nodal gap structure .",
    "thus , in combination with our analysis of the zero field temperature dependence , our data favors the sign changing multiband superconductivity of @xmath3s - wave state .",

    "the small specific heat jump ratio at @xmath0 and substantial residual density of states at @xmath1  k in the sc state indicate that impurity effects due to strong unitary scatterers should be included to explain the specific heat results .",
    "the zero - field specific heat data at high temperatures above 2  k and sub - linear magnetic field dependence of the sommerfeld coefficient are equally well described by nodal and nodeless multiband sc gaps with impurity effects . however",
