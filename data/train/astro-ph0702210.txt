    "the scattering of the radio waves as they propagate through the ism has long been a clue to small scale inhomogeneities in the ionized interstellar plasma .",
    "the scattering is seen in the dynamic spectrum of pulsar signals as random modulations in frequency and time .",
    "islands of intensity in the dynamic spectrum , often referred to as `` scintles '' , are sometimes modulated by a crisscross pattern . by fourier analyzing the dynamic spectrum , stinebring et al .",
    "( 2001 ) discovered the remarkable phenomenon of parabolic arcs that underlies the criss - cross substructure . in this paper",
    ", we analyze parabolic arcs from archival observations of psr  b1133 + 16 originally reported by gupta , rickett , & lyne ( 1994 ) .",
    "the two - dimensional fourier spectrum of the primary dynamic spectrum is often referred to as the secondary spectrum . however , as described by cordes et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , it can also be regarded as the `` differential delay - doppler '' distribution , whose coordinates are time delay ( @xmath1 ) and doppler frequency ( or fringe rate @xmath2 ) , being the variables conjugate to radio frequency @xmath3 and time @xmath4 .",
    "the theory of the arcs is described in that paper , which henceforth we refer to as crsc , and is also discussed by walker at al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "the basic arc phenomenon is remarkably simple , even though it lay undiscovered for over 30 years . when scattered waves arrive at the observer from two angles they interfere and cause fringes in intensity .",
    "the observer is moving relative to this interference pattern and sees a sinusoidal variation in both time and frequency , which thus appears as a pair of points in the secondary spectrum .",
    "the coordinates of these points are the differences in group delay and doppler frequency between the two scattered waves .",
    "the doppler shift depends on the relative velocity between the source and observer along the ( scattered ) lines of sight .",
    "hence the _ difference in doppler shift of waves scattered along two different paths through the ism depends only on the angles of scattering and the _ transverse velocity of the observer and pulsar relative to the ism .",
    "it is the beating of these slightly different doppler shifts that makes the fringe vary in time and so their difference equals the fringe rate @xmath2 . there is a quadratic relation of delay to fringe rate because , while the delay depends on the square of the angle of scattering , the doppler shift depends linearly on the angles .",
    "when one of the waves is unscattered the result is a simple parabola @xmath5 . _",
    "_    the observational properties of pulsar scintillation arcs have been described by hill et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who observed arcs over a broad range of wavelengths and found the curvature to be remarkably constant and to follow the expected scaling as wavelength squared .",
    "arc observations from five pulsars are shown by crsc , who summarize the various arc phenomenon .",
    "the results show many deviations from the simple arc @xmath5 .",
    "a particuarly striking form is the occasional appearance of `` reverse arclets '' which are displaced from the origin and whose curvature is equal in magnitude , but reversed in sign , to that of the main ( forward ) arc .",
    "hill et al .",
    "( 2005 ) reported on a set of remarkable stable reverse arclets from psr b0834 + 06 .",
    "we present results for the evolution of the arcs seen in psr  b1133 + 16 at 408 mhz in archival observations spanning 16 months . on two of the days",
    "observed with short time resolution the delay - doppler spectrum showed several discrete arcs with reversed curvature , similar to those shown by hill et al .",
    "we concentrate on fitting a model to one of those days . from an assumed brightness distribution",
    "we calculate the expected delay - doppler spectrum using the screen theory of crsc .",
    "then we iteratively adjust the parameters of the model to fit to the observed spectrum .",
    "although the fitting is not unique we are able to explain the reversed arcs and obtain an estimate of the scattered brightness distribution .",
    "this model distribution is then compared with that expected from a kolmogorov scattering medium .",
    "we finish with a brief discussion of what structures in the interstellar medium might be responsible .",
    "the technique we use , which is model - fitting to match the observed secondary spectrum , differs from the inversion described by walker and stinebring ( 2005 ) , who perform the match to the primary dynamic spectrum .",
    "we discuss the differences between the two methods in  [ sec : theory ] .",
    "the observations were made with the 76 m telescope at jodrell bank between september 1984 and january 1986 , as described by gupta , rickett , & lyne ( 1994 ) .",
    "an auto - correlation spectrometer was centered at 408 mhz with 256 channels of 20 khz covering 5 mhz .",
    "the spectrometer was gated synchronously with the pulsar period and spectra were averaged in windows on and off the pulse .",
    "the averaging time was normally 30 seconds and on two occasions it was shortened to 10 seconds .",
    "the duration ( @xmath6 ) of most observations was from one to four hours .",
    "the on and off pulse spectra were corrected for the one - bit auto - correlation normalized and subtracted to create a primary dynamic spectrum of pulse intensity @xmath7 .",
    "the left hand panels of figure [ fig : days01 ] shows @xmath7 for 8 and 9 september 1984 ( which we call days 0 and 1 of the observing sequence ) ; they exhibit crisscross structure with a predominance of scintles that drift toward higher frequency with time . with the 10 second sampling",
    "one can see fine scale fringes drifting in the same direction .",
    "the right panels are the corresponding secondary spectrum  @xmath8 or delay - doppler spectrum , which is the squared magnitude of the fourier transform of the primary spectrum : @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the two dimensional discrete fourier transform of the sampled primary spectrum @xmath7 . with time resolution of 10 seconds and frequency resolution of 20khz ,",
    "the nyquist frequencies are @xmath11 cycles min@xmath12 ( cpm ) and @xmath13 cycles / mhz ( or 25.6 @xmath14sec ) .",
    "the associated spectral resolutions are @xmath15 and @xmath16sec .",
    "the @xmath17 plots show structure which is strongest near the origin and extends out to large delays ( @xmath1 ) in the lower part of the panel ( ie for negative @xmath2 ) .",
    "we call this the forward arc , since it is curved toward the @xmath1 axis .",
    "it consists of discrete curves , which we call reverse arcs , since they are curved in the opposite sense .",
    "the apexes of the reverse arcs lie approximately along the parabola @xmath5 . on close",
    "inspection one can see several nearly parallel forward arcs .",
    "the top and bottom panels of figure [ fig : days01 ] are separated by 27 hrs and show very similar behavior in general , but the individual reverse arcs have clearly changed substantially .",
    "the main goal of our paper is to investigate these reverse arcs and to find a model for the interstellar angular scattering function that could explain them .",
    "after rapidly sampled observations were made on september 8th and 9th 1984 , a slower standard sampling interval of 30 seconds was adopted for monitoring the iss of psr  b1133 + 16 .",
    "figure [ fig : full12 ] shows @xmath17 plots from twelve observations spanning 481 days .",
    "days 0 - 31 show the same general character of a v - shaped `` valley '' with little power along the delay axis , flanked by diffuse power often appearing as a set of discrete reverse arcs , which can be asymmetric in @xmath2 .",
    "then day 45 shows a simpler forward arc which fades remarkably over days 96 and 142 .",
    "a strong forward arc appears on day 194 and by day 288 multiple reverse arcs similar to days 0 - 31 have returned .",
    "day 415 is similar to day 194 , but day 481 has weak and indistinct arc structure .",
    "these remarkable changes in the appearance of the secondary spectra are evidence that the line of sight crossed through particular localized structures , as we discuss in   4 .    with 30 second sampling @xmath18  cpm , and so features beyond @xmath19  cpm",
    "can be aliassed into the figure .",
    "this is evident by comparing the plots for days 0 and 1 in figures ( [ fig : full12 ] ) and ( [ fig : days01 ] ) .",
    "for example on day 1 figure ( [ fig : full12 ] ) shows a linear feature at @xmath20 cpm and @xmath21sec .",
    "this is an alias from @xmath22 cpm , visible in the lower right panel of figure [ fig : days01 ] at @xmath21sec with its apex near @xmath23 cpm .",
    "the figure ( [ fig : days01 ] ) data were a 23 minute observation immediately following the 30 min observation figure ( [ fig : full12 ] ) .",
    "this discrete reverse arc changed very little in 40 minutes . though it clearly changed between day 0 and 1 .",
    "days 9 and 16 show fuzzy reverse arcs for both positive and negative @xmath2 , which are probably confused by aliasing , but give evidence for an evolution in the asymmetry as well as in the reverse arc features .    in one of the observations of psr b1133 + 16 shown by crsc the secondary spectrum has two very well defined discrete forward arcs .",
    "putney and stinebring ( 2006 ) have found multiple arcs in six pulsars .",
    "for b1133 + 16 they found the arc curvatures to fall near four discrete values , but that the arc strengths were quite variable .",
    "they suggest that these are due to variable amplitude scattering at four discrete distances from the earth .",
    "consequently , we have estimated the curvature @xmath24 ( defined by @xmath25 ) from each of our observations scaled to 1 ghz .",
    "the mean of our values over 1984 september to 1986 january was @xmath26  sec@xmath27 with an rms scatter of @xmath28  sec@xmath27 , which is consistent with one of their values at @xmath29 sec@xmath27 .",
    "we do not detect multiple forward arcs , but note the signal - to - noise ratio in our data is lower than in most of stinebring s data .",
    "we also note that the curvature estimation becomes more difficult in the presence of reverse arclets , and in such cases we trace the arc by the location of their apexes .",
    "we use the theory of arcs in the secondary spectrum as given by crsc .",
    "section 3.3 of that paper analyzes @xmath17 in terms of a `` brightness function '' @xmath30 that represents the instantaneous strength of contributions to the intensity at a given observing point as a function of the angle of arrival @xmath31 .",
    "the theory provides insight into the basic interference effects that give rise to the arc phenomenon , but it does not include the dispersive delays introduced by propagation through the irregular plasma density in the ism . in  [ sec : simulation ] we use a full electromagnetic simulation to include such effects .",
    "consider a pulsar at distance @xmath32 whose radiation is scattered by a screen at a distance @xmath33 from the pulsar .",
    "the observer sees a superposition of interference fringes from each pair of apparent angles of arrival @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the fringes contribute to a single pixel in @xmath8 if the angles obey : f _ & = & ( ) ( _ 2 ^ 2 - _ 1 ^ 2 ) [ eq : fnu ] + f_t & = & ( ) ( _ x2 - _ x1 ) , [ eq : ft ] where @xmath36 is the speed of light and @xmath37 is the central wavelength observed .",
    "@xmath38 is the effective transverse velocity relative to the scattering region of the line of sight from pulsar to observer , which both may be moving ( cordes and rickett , 1998 ) ; without loss of generality we have chosen the orientation of @xmath38 to define the direction of @xmath39",
    ".    equation ( 8) of crsc expresses @xmath8 as a four - fold integral over all pairs of angles , subject to the constraints of equations [ eq : fnu ] and [ eq : ft ] .",
    "the constraints allow the result to be reduced to a two - fold integral as given by crsc equations ( 9 ) or ( b4 & b5 ) .",
    "we used the latter , since it is more convenient numerically , and we rewrite it here in a slightly different form as @xmath40 which is the delay - doppler spectrum in terms of normalized delay and fringe rate : @xmath41 @xmath42 is a normalizing angle , typically chosen to be the angular radius of the diffractive brightness distribution .",
    "the result is s_2(p , q ) & = & q_-^_-^ b(_+,y_1)b(_-,y_2)dy_1dy_2 [ eq : s2int ] + _ & = & p 2q - 1 2q(y_2 ^ 2 - y_1 ^ 2 )    where @xmath43 is the brightness function in terms of normalized angular coordinates @xmath44 , and the constraints in equations ( [ eq : fnu ] & [ eq : ft ] ) become : p & = & ( x_2 ^ 2 - x_1 ^ 2 ) + ( y_2 ^ 2 - y_1 ^ 2 ) + q = x_2 - x_1 . [ eq : pq ] there is also a second mirrored relation obtained by mapping @xmath45 .",
    "hence we can describe an arc as the locus of points in @xmath46 due to interference of a narrow discrete component in @xmath43 at @xmath47 with the remaining extended continuum in @xmath48 , as is done in section 3.4.3 of crsc .",
    "a primary forward arc @xmath49 comes from an undeviated discrete component in @xmath48 interfering with the extended continuum in @xmath48 .",
    "this is the condition under weak scintillation described by crsc .",
    "the boundary of this primary arc is @xmath25 ( or @xmath50 ) . in turn",
    "@xmath24 is related to the physical parameters via equations [ eq : ft ] and [ eq : fnu ] .",
    "in general we substitute @xmath47 for @xmath51 in equation ( [ eq : pq ] ) to obtain a relation between @xmath52 and @xmath53 depending on @xmath54 and @xmath55 , which vary over the continuum in @xmath48 . the special case where @xmath48 is narrow in one dimension and extended along a line @xmath56 , at an angle @xmath57 to the @xmath58-axis",
    ", allows us to eliminate both @xmath54 and @xmath55 to obtain the quadratic relation between @xmath52 and @xmath53 : @xmath59 this reverse arc is a parabola with an apex at @xmath60 and negative curvature @xmath61 , which has unit magnitude if @xmath62 ( i.e.  scatter broadening parallel to the velocity ) . the corresponding forward arc with its apex at negative @xmath52 is obtained by reversing the signs of @xmath52 and @xmath53 in equation ( [ eq : pqarc ] ) .",
    "both sets of arcs are shown in figure 4 of crsc .",
    "of course , in general the scatter broadening function is not one - dimensional , as assumed above .",
    "further , we have not discussed the power density of @xmath63 along an arc .",
    "this depends on the relative strength of the discrete component supposed to exist in @xmath48 and on the shape and intensity of its continuum , as described by the integral ( [ eq : s2int ] ) .",
    "the parallax and proper motion of psr  b1133 + 16 were measured by brisken et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ; they found its distance @xmath64 kpc and its transverse velocity @xmath65 km  sec@xmath12 .",
    "in general the scintillation velocity depends on the transverse velocities of the pulsar , the earth and the scattering medium , but since our pulsar is moving much faster than the earth and the medium , we have @xmath66 . hence the arc curvature , as given by equation ( 8) of stinebring et al . ( 2001 ) , becomes : a = = 0.0244 ^3 , [ eq : curv ] at our observing wavelength .",
    "the arc curvature @xmath67 sec@xmath68 , given in section 2.1 , is scaled to 1 ghz . when scaled back to our observed frequency of 408 mhz",
    ", we have @xmath69 sec@xmath68 .",
    "this results in @xmath70 , giving a screen at 133 @xmath71 7 pc from the earth . putting the mean value into equations [ eq : fnu ] and [ eq : ft ] gives the mappings : f_t , cpm = 0.15 ( _ x2,mas-_x1,mas ) + f _ , sec = 0.26 ( _ 2mas^2-_1mas^2 ) .",
    "[ eq : map ]    the secondary spectrum from september 8th 1984 shown in the upper right panel of figure [ fig : days01 ] exhibits a series of reverse arcs extending to delays of 25 @xmath14sec , which are visible predominantly at negative @xmath2 .",
    "we choose these data to model quantitatively , because of these unusual _ asymmetric discrete reverse arcs .",
    "consider , for example , the faint reverse arc with its apex at @xmath72sec and @xmath73 cpm , which is visible over the approximate range @xmath74 cpm .",
    "_    a discrete reverse arc is formed by interference of a point component in the scattered brightness function with an anisotropic extended component . to simplify",
    "the analysis consider the normalized brightness @xmath43 to be narrow in @xmath75 and extended in @xmath58 , i.e.  parallel to the iss velocity ( i.e. @xmath62 in equation([eq : pqarc ] ) ) .",
    "thus we write @xmath76\\delta(y)$ ] , where @xmath77 represents the extended component and we use delta functions to model the narrow structures .",
    "the interference between waves from @xmath78 and @xmath58 gives @xmath79 .",
    "thus , if @xmath80 extends from @xmath81 to @xmath82 , the reverse arc will have its apex at @xmath83 , @xmath84 and be visible over @xmath85 .    in this model @xmath86 and the apex lies on the basic arc . hence substituting @xmath1 and @xmath2 from above into equation ( [ eq : curv ] ) gives @xmath87 , which is consistent with the value 0.63 obtained above . using the mapping in equation [ eq : map ] , the observed range @xmath74 cpm for the reverse arc , corresponds to interference of a discrete component at -7.5 mas interfering with an extended component from -2.7  mas to 2.7  mas . in a similar way for each discrete reverse arc on day 0 we can find a corresponding pair of components in the scattered brightness ( a point and extended component along @xmath39 ) .",
    "following this idea we model the brightness distribution ( in normalized coordinates ) as a sum of gaussian functions : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the intensity , @xmath90 describes the width of @xmath58 , @xmath91 describes the width of @xmath75 , @xmath92 is the offset in @xmath58 , and @xmath93 is the offset in @xmath75 .",
    "we made an initial model in the manner described above for the most obvious reverse arcs in figure [ fig : days01 ] .",
    "as more components are added the extended component eventually becomes the sum of the discrete components .",
    "then we tried to optimize the model by minimizing the sum of the squared errors between the observed @xmath63 and the model obtained by a numerical integral of equation ( [ eq : s2int ] ) .",
    "we chose to work in normalized delay @xmath52 , fringe rate @xmath53 and angle @xmath94 and used a normalizing angle @xmath95  mas , with the constants evaluated as discussed above .",
    "the fitting was done over two regions where the arcs are visible in the top right panel of figure [ fig : days01 ] : a lower rectangle -20 cpm by 025 @xmath14s and a smaller upper rectangle 01 cpm by 05 @xmath14s .",
    "we estimated the noise background in @xmath17 from the average noise level in @xmath17 over the regions not included in the fit , and this constant was added to the model .",
    "we defined @xmath96 in a standard fashion : ^2 = ^i , j [ s_2(f_,i , f_t , j ) - s_2,mod , i , j]^2 , where @xmath97 . at each point",
    "@xmath98 is an estimate of the secondary spectrum , which has a standard deviation @xmath99 equal to its mean value ( following exponential statistics ) .",
    "once the model is close to an optimum value it provides an estimate of @xmath99 .",
    "thus we used the model as an estimate for @xmath99 rather than the observed value .",
    "the fitting was done in a semi - automated fashion .",
    "starting with separate optimization of the parameters describing each narrow component responsible for the more obvious discrete arcs , we minimized @xmath96 over a rectangle around each apex .",
    "table [ table : model ] lists the coordinates of the apexes of six of the most obvious reverse arcs . with five parameters for each gaussian the number of parameters to fit grows quickly as components are added . to simplify we started with all components centered on the x - axis ( ie @xmath100 ) . with the position @xmath92 of a component fixed we explored the influence of @xmath90 and @xmath91 . for the arcs at large delays we found that @xmath90 had to be quite narrow to agree with the observed arc thickness in delay , but that @xmath91 could be substantially wider . as a result",
    "we did not optimize for the @xmath75-position or width , but set them all on the @xmath58 axis with @xmath101  mas .",
    "this left three parameters to be optimized for each component ( amplitude , @xmath58-position and width ) .",
    "however , as discussed above the extent in @xmath53 is governed by the @xmath58- position and width of the associated extended component , thus they too had to be adjusted .",
    "close inspection of the observed @xmath17 shows narrow parallel forward arcs crossing the reverse arcs .",
    "as can be seen from figure 4 of crsc , these are extensions of the reverse arc to positive @xmath2 values which are reflected about the origin .",
    "thus they show interference of a discrete component ( @xmath102 ) with components of the scattered brightness extended over a wide range , extending to @xmath58 values more negative than @xmath78 .",
    "this emphasizes that in fact the entire set of arcs is caused by the mutual interference of all possible pairs of points in @xmath43 .    as noted above the observations",
    "show parallel forward arcs ( for negative @xmath2 ) , but they also include some that appear as fainter ( whiter ) stripes .",
    "such fainter stripes come from a discrete minimum in @xmath43 , whereas the brighter arcs are from discrete maxima .",
    "we modelled this effect by putting dips into the brightness function , which we achieved by having two offset broad extended components with a minimum in @xmath48 between them .",
    "these minima improved the fit slightly over a model without the minima .",
    "thus in choosing how many and where to place new components , we were guided by the visual appearance of the observed @xmath17 in comparison with the model .",
    "table [ table : parameter ] gives a list of the parameters for the 9-component model for @xmath43 ( scaled into milli - arcseconds ) .",
    "components 1 - 6 are relatively narrow ( @xmath103  mas ) and components 7 - 9 are relatively wide .",
    "it is the interference of the narrow with the wide components that is responsible for the 6 most obvious discrete reverse arcs .",
    "their position and width in doppler frequency governs the range in @xmath58 of the brightness function .",
    "we optimized the model to minimize @xmath96 with regard to the three variable parameters of the 9 components .",
    "the model can be seen in the upper panel of figure [ fig : ss - model ] , to be compared with the upper right panel of figure [ fig : days01 ] . however , the value of @xmath96 was about five times the number of points in the fit , indicating that the model is far from optimum even though it was a local minimum .",
    "the largest discrepancy was traced to the region near the @xmath2 axis ( from -1 to -2 cpm ) , in which the observed power level is elevated but the model is not .",
    "the higher level in the observations appears to be due to effects from broadband variation of the pulse strength ( intrinsic pulse modulations or impulsive interference ) .",
    "consequently , we estimated this extra power by averaging @xmath17 in ( from -2 to -3 cpm ) as a function of delay , and added it to the model .",
    "this refinement caused little change in the best parameters but reduced the minimum @xmath96 to about twice the number of data points .",
    "visually , the model resembles the observations in the asymmetry versus @xmath2 , the presence of 6 reverse arcs , the location of their apexes , and their width in delay ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "given the success of the fit from a visual perspective , we decided not to attempt a better fit by introducing extra components , since we would just be refining the model for a particular snapshot of the scattering function @xmath48 . further , since our method of fitting relies on the visual impression in choosing how many components and their initial parameters , the result is not unique .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ fig : ss - model ] shows the model secondary spectrum .",
    "it corresponds to the brightness model in table [ table : parameter ] with one modification .",
    "in order to represent the `` speckle '' effect in a snapshot of the scattered brightness we multiplied the sum of gaussians by a random function of @xmath58 ( uniform distribution ) , before computing the integral in equation ( [ eq : s2int ] ) . the effect is to cause a set of fine nearly parallel forward arcs , somewhat reminiscent of the observed fine structure in @xmath17 .",
    "the model brightness is plotted logarithmically in the upper panel of figure [ fig : bright - model ] .",
    "note the asymmetry and anisotropy in its distribution of discrete components along the axis parallel to @xmath38 .",
    "the effect of rotating the brightness by an angle @xmath57 to the @xmath58-axis increases the magnitude of the curvature in @xmath46 plane , as can be seen from equation ( [ eq : pqarc ] ) .",
    "however , this could be compensated by a change in the screen distance parameter @xmath104 .",
    "thus we can not determine both @xmath104 and @xmath57 and leave our results displayed with @xmath62 .",
    "we now consider what constraint can be placed on the @xmath75-extent of the brightness function ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "when @xmath105 and @xmath55 are non - zero , we obtain the a version of equation ( [ eq : pqarc ] ) in which @xmath106 is replaced by @xmath107 .",
    "let the extended and point components be centered on the @xmath58-axis with widths @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively .",
    "then these ranges broaden the thickness of the reverse arc in delay ( ie @xmath52 is broadened by the larger of @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the widths of the reverse arcs in the upper right panel of figure [ fig : days01 ] are about @xmath112sec . with the scalings from equation ( [ eq : map ] ) , this constrains the rms @xmath75-widths to be less than about 0.44  mas .",
    "we set them ( somewhat arbitrarily ) to be 0.3  mas .",
    "although the parameters we used gave us arc and subarc structures that resemble the particular psr  b1133 + 16 data , we do not imply that it is the only set nor is it the best set .",
    "we have produced one model for the brightness distribution that reproduces the visual form of the observations and is optimized within a limited range of the parameters .    from this",
    "we conclude that the asymmetrical form of the observed secondary spectrum and the presence of narrow discrete reverse arcs can be successfully explained by an asymmetrical and anisotropic brightness function with a number of narrow discrete features .",
    "the constraint on the widths in @xmath113 is important since , with an @xmath39-width of about @xmath114  mas , it constrains the effective axial ratio of the scattered brightness function to be greater than about 10 .",
    "however , an interesting feature of the model is that the individual features can be wider in @xmath113 than in @xmath39 ; in other words they may be anisotropic in the orthogonal direction .",
    "as shown by crsc , an absence of power along the delay axis in the secondary spectrum is caused by anisotropic broadening , enhanced along the direction of the scintillation velocity .",
    "all of 12 of the secondary spectra plotted in figure [ fig : full12 ] show no power along the delay axis .",
    "hence the same basic anisotropy in the scattering persisted over about 500 days , but the detailed form of the scattered brightness changed substantially over days and weeks .",
    "crsc used the simulation code of coles et al .",
    "( 1995 ) to simulate secondary spectra of waves scattered by a dispersive phase changing screen . in normal usage",
    "the method synthesizes one realization of a stationary random phase screen , which modulates a plane wave .",
    "the emerging complex field is then propagated a distance @xmath115 to the observer , by transforming into wavenumber and multiplying by the appropriate ( fresnel ) filter and back transforming to the spatial domain .",
    "the intensity is saved along a straight line track through the two - dimensional complex wave field .",
    "the result simulates a time series as an observer moves relative to a scattered wave field .",
    "a dynamic spectrum is a set of such time series , created as the radio frequency of the incident wave is incremented .",
    "the secondary spectrum is computed in the same way as for the data .",
    "crsc simulated the screen as a single two - dimensional realization of a stationary random process following a given wavenumber spectrum .",
    "they showed results for a kolmogorov screen .",
    "when anisotropy was included , some results had multiple discrete forward and reverse arcs . however , the results differed from our observations of psr  b1133 + 16 in that the discrete arcs were considerably finer and distributed symmetrically in fringe rate ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the addition of a linear gradient in the phase across the screen ( i.e.  a simple refraction ) caused the secondary spectrum to be asymmetric in fringe rate .",
    "they showed that the phase gradient needed to be large enough to shift the scattered image by at least its own radius .",
    "this is a much larger gradient than is expected randomly for a medium with a kolmogorov spectrum .    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]     the first point is that the scattered image is highly elongated with an axial ratio of 10:1 or more .",
    "further , the axis of elongation is roughly parallel to the proper motion direction of the pulsar ( within , say , @xmath116 ) .",
    "this means that the spatial density structures are elongated in a direction roughly perpendicular to this direction .",
    "the second point is that the images are not centered on the origin .",
    "we see two possible explanations : either refraction by a large scale transverse gradient in the column density of electrons ; or highly localized scattering caused by a region that is centered to one side of the line towards the pulsar .",
    "refraction seems likely since similar refraction has been invoked to explain the persistent drifting in frequency of scintillation features in the dynamic spectra of some pulsars ( e.g. shishov , 1974 ; hewish , wolszczan and graham , 1985 ; gupta , rickett and lyne , 1994 ) .",
    "the basic idea is that a refracting region deflects the scattered ( and unscattered ) waves which causes a lateral shift in the scintillation pattern . since in a plasma",
    "the angle of refraction is strongly dependent on the observing frequency , the frequency for a given maximum of intensity will drift in time .",
    "such a drift will be seen as an asymmetry versus doppler frequency in the power distribution of the secondary spectrum , this effect was confirmed by simulations reported by crsc .",
    "the alternative explanation is that there are highly localized regions of very irregular ( turbulent ? ) plasma , that can deflect ( ie scatter or refract ) the radio waves into our line of sight .",
    "this implies that thay must be small enough to subtend an angle at the observer smaller than their maximum angle of deflection .",
    "the angles of arrival of these waves will be determined by how far the enhanced turbulence is from the direct line of sight and they will not depend systematically on frequency .",
    "a third point about the scattered images is that they are `` blotchy '' , but the blotches have a lower filling factor than would be expected for the usual speckle in an angular spectrum .",
    "( see the simulations shown by crsc , in which there is a multitude of reverse arcs due to speckle with a high filling factor from a kolmogorov medium ) .",
    "we conclude that the blotchy nature of our scattered image is not compatible with a uniform kolmogorov random medium .",
    "our results do not , on their own , allow us to determine the nature of the medium .",
    "however , the fascinating measurements by hill et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for pulsar psr b0834 + 06 provide an important constraint .",
    "they found that the frequency - scaling of the positions of the reverse arcs was not compatible with frequency dependent refraction and implies the alternative of highly localized regions of enhanced scattering as the cause of each reverse arc . under this scenario",
    "the regions have a linear size given by their apparent angular size times the scattering distance ",
    "@xmath117  pc . with angular extents of 0.1 - 1",
    "mas their maximum implied linear sizes are 0.014 - 0.14 au .    considering that the discrete reverse arcs were only prominent in some of the observations ( ie days 0 - 31 and 288 ) , the regions of localized enhanced scattering are irregularly distributed in the ionized ism . in 31 days",
    "the pulsar moves about 10 au transverse to the line of sight .",
    "thus the persistence of the reverse arcs through 31 days suggests that the localized regions of enhanced scattering are clumped over about 10 au .",
    "if localized scattering regions are indeed responsible for the discrete reverse arcs , the next question is what are these regions physically .",
    "however , this is beyond the reach of our present investigation , and we refer interested readers to rickett , lyne and gupta ( 1997 ) and the proceedings of the workshop on `` small ionized and neutral structure in the ism '' , held in socorro may 2006 , particularly the papers by stinebring and rickett .",
    "the iss of pulsar b1133 + 16 showed pronounced changes in the character of its secondary spectra in 12 days of observation spread over 15 months .",
    "while these data which were centered at 408 mhz were recorded over 20 years ago , they often show the parabolic arc phenomenon that was discovered quire recently by stinebring et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . however , the basic parabolic arc varied substantially in its extent and shape .",
    "discrete reverse arcs were visible for about two months early in the sequence and then again after about nine months .",
    "there was a two month interval when the arc was barely detectable , corresponding to when the primary dynamic spectra had a very wide decorrelation bandwidth .",
    "we concentrated our analysis on two days with clearly visible discrete reverse arcs , which were fortuitously sampled rapidly enough to resolve them in doppler frequency .",
    "using the theory of crsc , which ignores dispersion , we modelled these features and hence were able to estimate the scattered brightness distribution .",
    "we tested the applicability of the theory , by simulating and electromagnetic wave propagation code that includes dispersion , and found that the reverse arcs are not altered substantially by including dispersion .",
    "our estimate of the scattered brightness function is highly eleongated with an axial ratio of more than 10:1 .",
    "it is asymmetrical about the origin and has a small number of discrete maxima .",
    "these properties are not consistent with expectations from a scattering region that behaves as a statistically homogeneous random medium with a kolmogorov spectrum . when combined witth the conclusions from hill et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , our results suggest that there are highly localized discrete scattering regions which subtend 0.1 - 1 mas , but can scatter ( or refract ) the radiation by angles that are five or more times larger .",
    "the asymmetry in the scattered image may well be caused by the chance configuration of these regions .",
