    "the role of surface tension for the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) was discussed long ago @xcite , however , up to now the situation is somewhat unclear @xcite . in nuclear and cluster physics",
    "the importance of the surface tension for the properties of cep is known from a number of exactly solvable cluster models with the 1@xmath1 order phase transition ( pt ) which describe the critical point properties very well .",
    "these models are built on the assumptions that the difference of the bulk part ( or the volume dependent part ) of free energy of two phases disappears at phase equilibrium and that , in addition , the difference of the surface part ( or the surface tension ) of free energy vanishes at the critical point .",
    "the most famous of them is the fisher droplet model ( fdm ) @xcite which has been successfully used to analyze the condensation of a gaseous phase ( droplets of all sizes ) into a liquid .",
    "another such a model is a simplified version of the statistical multifragmentation model ( smm ) @xcite which was solved analytically both for infinite @xcite and for finite @xcite volumes of the system .",
    "the analysis of critical indices of the smm @xcite shows that the value of fisher exponent @xmath2 of this model is consistent with isis collaboration data @xcite and eos collaboration data @xcite .",
    "such an experimentally obtained range of the @xmath3 index is of a principal importance because it gives a very strong evidence that the smm , and , thus , the nuclear matter , has a tricritical endpoint rather than a critical endpoint @xcite .",
    "this success of the smm initiated the studies of the surface partitions of large clusters within the hills and dales model @xcite and led to a discovery of the origin of the temperature independent surface entropy similar to the fdm . as a consequence , the surface tension coefficient of large clusters consisting of the discrete constituents should linearly depend on the temperature of the system @xcite and must vanish at the critical endpoint .",
    "however , the present formulation of the hills and dales model @xcite , which successfully estimates the upper and lower bounds of the surface deformations of the discrete physical clusters , does not look suitable for quark - gluon bags . therefore , in this work i insert the surface tension into the gas of bags model ( gbm ) @xcite , assume a certain dependence of the surface tension coefficient on temperature and baryonic chemical potential",
    ". then i analyze the quark gluon bags with surface tension ( qgbst ) model and concentrate on the impact of surface tension on the properties of the deconfinement phase diagram and the qcd critical endpoint .    here",
    "i show that at low values of the baryonic chemical potential the 1@xmath1 order deconfinement pt degenerates into a cross - over , if the surface tension coefficient becomes negative for lower values of temperature than the transition temperature .",
    "also i prove the existence of an additional pt of the 2@xmath0 or higher order along the curve where the surface tension coefficient vanishes .",
    "thus , i am arguing that the qgbst model predicts the existence of the tricritical rather than critical endpoint .",
    "the isobaric partition of the qgbst model obtained from the grand canonical one @xmath4 is as follows @xmath5 }    \\ , . % \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the function @xmath6 consists of two parts , the discrete mass - volume spectrum @xmath7 , and the continuous part of the spectrum @xmath8 @xmath9 } { v^{\\tau } }   ~ ,   \\label{fqs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the function @xmath10 is the particle density of bags of mass @xmath11 and eigen volume @xmath12 and degeneracy @xmath13 .    at the moment",
    "the particular choice of function @xmath14 in ( [ fqs ] ) is not important .",
    "the key point of my treatment is that it should have the form of eq .",
    "( [ fqs ] ) which has a singularity at @xmath15 because for @xmath16 the integral over the bag volume @xmath17 diverges at its upper limit .",
    "as will be shown below the isobaric partition ( [ zs ] ) has two kind of singularities : the simple pole @xmath18 and the essential singularity @xmath19 the rightmost singularity defines the phase in which matter exists , whereas a pt occurs when two singularities coincide @xcite .",
    "all singularities are defined by the equation @xmath20 the @xmath17-linear term in the exponential of the continuous spectrum ( [ fqs ] ) is nothing else , but a difference of the bulk free energy of a bag of volume @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath21 , which is under external pressure @xmath22 , and the bulk free energy of the same bag filled with qgp , i.e. @xmath23 . the term @xmath24 appears due to the hard core repulsion @xcite , whereas the qgp pressure , @xmath25 , appears in ( [ fqs ] ) as a generalization of the hagedorn mass spectrum @xcite . at phase equilibrium",
    "this difference of the bulk free energies vanishes and the properties of phase equilibrium are defined by the surface free energy .",
    "note that the usage of the grand canonical description for the exponential mass or volume spectrum of hagedorn type was strongly criticized recently @xcite because of the thermostatic properties of this spectrum .",
    "however , the hard core repulsion compensates the growing part of the mass - volume spectrum and , hence , the criticism of refs .",
    "@xcite is irrelevant to the present model .",
    "the new element in ( [ fqs ] ) is the presence of surface free energy @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) of the bag .",
    "the power @xmath28 which describes the bag s effective surface is a constant which , in principle , can differ from the typical fdm and smm value @xmath29 , if the highly non - sperical bags are possible @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the temperature dependent surface tension coefficient to @xmath30 ( the reduced surface tension coefficient hereafter ) which has the form @xmath31^{2k + 1 } $ ] ( @xmath32 ) . here",
    "@xmath33 can be a smooth function of the temperature , but for simplicity i fix it to be a constant .",
    "in choosing such a simple surface energy parameterization i follow the original fisher idea @xcite which allows one to account for the surface energy by considering some mean bag of volume @xmath17 and surface @xmath34 .",
    "the consideration of the general mass - volume - surface bag spectrum is reserved for the future investigation .",
    "in contrast to the fdm and smm , the power @xmath28 which describes the bag s effective surface is a constant which , as mentioned above , can differ from the typical fdm and smm value @xmath29 .",
    "this is so because near the deconfinement pt region the qgp has low density and , hence , like in the low density nuclear matter @xcite , the non - sperical bags ( spaghetti - like or lasagna - like @xcite ) can be favorable ( see a @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a similar idea of  polymerization \" of gluonic quasiparticles was introduced recently @xcite .",
    "the second essential difference with the fdm and smm surface tension parameterizations is that the vanishing of @xmath35 above the cep temperature is not required .",
    "as will be shown later , this is the most important assumption which , in contrast to the gbm , allows one to naturally describe the cross - over from hadron gas to qgp .",
    "note that negative value of the reduced surface tension coefficient @xmath35 above the cep does not mean anything wrong . as discussed above ,",
    "the surface tension coefficient consists of energy and entropy parts which have opposite signs @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath36 does not mean that the surface energy changes the sign , but it rather means that the surface entropy , i.e. the logarithm of the degeneracy of bags of a fixed volume , simply exceeds their surface energy .",
    "in other words , the number of non - spherical bags of a fixed volume becomes so large that the boltzmann exponent , which accounts for the energy `` costs '' of these bags , can not suppress them anymore .",
    "finally , the third essential difference with the fdm and smm is that it is assumed that the surface tension in the qgbst model vanishes at some line in @xmath37 plane , i.e. @xmath38 . however , in the subsequent sections i will consider @xmath39 for simplicity , and in sect .",
    "4 i will discuss the necessary modifications of the model with @xmath38 .    in principle",
    ", besides the bulk and surface parts of free energy , the continuous volume spectrum @xmath40 could include the curvature part as well , which may be important for small hadronic bubbles @xcite or for cosmological pt @xcite .",
    "it is necessary to stress , however , that the critical properties of the present model are defined by the infinite bag , therefore the inclusion into the function @xmath40 of a curvature term of bag s free energy of any sign could affect the thermodynamic quantities of this model at @xmath41 and @xmath42 , which is possible at ( tri)critical endpoint only ( see below ) . if , the curvature term was really important for the cluster models like the present one , then it should have been seen also at ( tri)critical points of the fdm , smm and many systems described by the fdm , but this is not the case @xcite .",
    "indeed , recently the complement method @xcite was applied to the analysis of the largest , but still mesoscopic drop of a radius @xmath43 representing the liquid in equilibrium with its vapor .",
    "the method allows one to find out the concentrations of the vapor clusters in finite system in a whole range of temperatures and determine the free energy difference of two phases with high precision .",
    "the latter enables us not only to extract the critical temperature , surface tension coefficient and even the value of fisher index @xmath3 of the infinite system , but also such a delicate effects as the gibbs - thomson correction @xcite to the free energy of a liquid drop . note that the gibbs - thomson correction behaves as @xmath44 , but the complement method @xcite allows one to find it , whereas the curvature part of free energy , which is proportional to @xmath43 , is not seen both for a drop and for smaller clusters .",
    "such a result is directly related to the qgp bags because qcd is expected to be in the same universality class @xcite as the 3-dimensional ising model whose clusters were analyzed in @xcite .",
    "therefore , admitting that for finite qgp bags the curvature effects may be essential , i leave them out because the critical behavior of the present model is defined by the properties of the infinite bag . on the other hand , similarly to the fdm , smm and fdm - like systems discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , i assume that the curvature part of free energy of the infinite qgp bag is not important and leave for the future analysis the question why this is so .",
    "according to the general theorem @xcite the analysis of pt existence of the gcp is now reduced to the analysis of the rightmost singularity of the isobaric partition ( [ zs ] ) .",
    "depending on the sign of the reduced surface tension coefficient , there are three possibilities .",
    "+ ( * i * ) the first possibility corresponds to @xmath45 .",
    "its treatment is very similar to the gbm parameterization of continuous spectrum with @xmath46 @xcite . in this case at low temperatures the qgp pressure @xmath47 is negative and , therefore , the rightmost singularity is a simple pole of the isobaric partition @xmath48 , which is mainly defined by a discrete part of the volume spectrum @xmath49 .",
    "the last inequality provides the convergence of the volume integral in ( [ fqs ] ) ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . on the other hand at very high @xmath30 the qgp pressure dominates and ,",
    "hence , the rightmost singularity is the essential singularity of the isobaric partition @xmath50 .",
    "the phase transition occurs , when the singularities coincide : @xmath51 which is nothing else , but the gibbs criterion .",
    "the graphical solution of eq .",
    "( [ s*vdw ] ) for all these possibilities is shown in fig .",
    "1 . like in the gbm @xcite , the necessary condition for the pt existence is the finiteness of @xmath52 at @xmath41 .",
    "it can be shown that the sufficient conditions are the following inequalities : @xmath53 for low temperatures and @xmath54 for @xmath55 .",
    "these conditions provide that at low @xmath30 the rightmost singularity of the isobaric partition is a simple pole , whereas for hight @xmath30 the essential singularity @xmath56 becomes its rightmost one ( see fig . 1 and a detailed analysis of the case @xmath57 ) .",
    "the pt order can be found from the @xmath30-derivatives of @xmath58 .",
    "thus , differentiating ( [ s*vdw ] ) one finds @xmath59    where the functions @xmath60 and @xmath61 are defined as ( @xmath62 ) @xmath63 } { v^{\\tau - a } } \\ , .",
    "% \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now it is easy to see that the transition is of the 1@xmath1 order , i.e. @xmath64 , provided @xmath65 for any @xmath3 .",
    "the 2@xmath0 or higher order phase transition takes place provided @xmath66 at @xmath67 .",
    "the latter condition is satisfied when @xmath68 diverges to infinity at @xmath69 , i.e. for @xmath30 approaching @xmath70 from below . like for the gbm choice ( [ fqs ] )",
    ", such a situation can exist for @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "studying the higher @xmath30-derivatives of @xmath73 at @xmath70 , one can show that for @xmath74 and for @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) there is a @xmath77 order phase transition @xmath78 with @xmath79 for @xmath80 and with a finite value of @xmath81 for @xmath82 .",
    "+ ( * ii * ) the second possibility , @xmath83 , described in the preceding paragraph , does not give anything new compared to the gbm @xcite .",
    "if the pt exists , then the graphical picture of singularities is basically similar to fig .",
    "the only difference is that , depending on the pt order , the derivatives of @xmath84 function with respect to @xmath85 should diverge at @xmath86 .",
    "+ ( * iii * ) a principally new possibility exists for @xmath87 , where @xmath88 . in this case there exists a cross - over , if for @xmath89 the rightmost singularity is @xmath73 , which corresponds to the leftmost curve in the left panel of fig .",
    "1 . under the latter ,",
    "its existence can be shown as follows .",
    "let us solve the equation for singularities ( [ s*vdw ] ) graphically ( see the right panel of fig .",
    "1 ) . for @xmath88",
    "the function @xmath14 diverges at @xmath41 . on the other hand , the partial derivatives @xmath90 and @xmath91 are always negative",
    "therefore , the function @xmath92 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath85 , which vanishes at @xmath93 . since the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ s*vdw ] ) is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath85 , then there can exist a single intersection @xmath94 of @xmath85 and @xmath95 functions .",
    "moreover , for finite @xmath96 values this intersection can occur on the right hand side of the point @xmath41 , i.e. @xmath97 ( see the right panel of fig .",
    "1 ) . thus , in this case the essential singularity @xmath41 can become the rightmost one for infinite temperature only .",
    "in other words , the pressure of the pure qgp can be reached at infinite @xmath30 , whereas for finite @xmath30 the hadronic mass spectrum gives a non - zero contribution into all thermodynamic functions .",
    "note that such a behavior is typical for the lattice qcd data at zero baryonic chemical potential @xcite .",
    "in terms of the present model it is clear that a cross - over existence means a fast transition of energy or entropy density in a narrow @xmath30 region from a dominance of the discrete mass - volume spectrum of light hadrons to a dominance of the continuous spectrum of heavy qgp bags .",
    "this is exactly the case for @xmath88 because in the right vicinity of the point @xmath41 the function @xmath95 decreases very fast and then it gradually decreases as function of @xmath85-variable .",
    "since , @xmath98 changes fast from @xmath99 to @xmath100 , their @xmath85-derivatives should change fast as well .",
    "now , recalling that the change from @xmath101 behavior to @xmath102 in @xmath85-variable corresponds to the cooling of the system ( see the right panel of fig .",
    "1 ) , i conclude that that there exists a narrow region of temperatures , where the @xmath30 derivative of system pressure , i.e. the entropy density , drops down from @xmath103 to @xmath104 very fast compared to other regions of @xmath30 , if system cools .",
    "if , however , in the vicinity of @xmath105 the rightmost singularity is @xmath96 , then for @xmath87 the situation is different and the cross - over does not exist .",
    "a detailed analysis of this situation is given in sect .",
    "4 .    note also that all these nice properties would vanish , if the reduced surface tension coefficient is zero or positive above @xmath106 .",
    "this is one of the crucial points of the present model which puts forward certain doubts about the vanishing of the reduced surface tension coefficient in the fdm and smm .",
    "these doubts are also supported by the first principle results obtained by the hills and dales model @xcite , because the surface entropy simply counts the degeneracy of a cluster of a fixed volume and it does not physically affect the surface energy of this cluster .",
    "the possibilities ( * i*)-(*iii * ) discussed in the preceding section remain unchanged for non - zero baryonic numbers .",
    "the latter should be included into consideration to make our model more realistic . to keep the presentation simple ,",
    "i do not consider strangeness .",
    "the inclusion of the baryonic charge of the quark - gluon bags does not change the two types of singularities of the isobaric partition ( [ zs ] ) and the corresponding equation for them ( [ s*vdw ] ) , but it leads to the following modifications of the @xmath107 and @xmath108 functions : @xmath109 } { v^{\\tau}}\\ , .",

    "it can be shown @xcite that the sufficient conditions for a pt existence are @xmath116 the condition ( [ sufcondi ] ) provides that the simple pole singularity @xmath117 is the rightmost one at vanishing @xmath118 and given @xmath30 , whereas the condition ( [ sufcondii ] ) ensures that @xmath119 is the rightmost singularity of the isobaric partition for all values of the baryonic chemical potential above some positive constant @xmath120 .",
    "this can be seen in fig . 1 for @xmath110 being a variable . since @xmath121 , where it exists , is a continuous function of its parameters ,",
    "one concludes that , if the conditions ( [ sufcondi ] ) and ( [ sufcondii ] ) , are fulfilled , then at some chemical potential @xmath122 the both singularities should be equal .",
    "thus , one arrives at the gibbs criterion ( [ pti ] ) , but for two variables @xmath123 it is easy to see that the inequalities ( [ sufcondi ] ) and ( [ sufcondii ] ) are the sufficient conditions of a pt existence for more complicated functional dependencies of @xmath124 and @xmath125 than the ones used here .    for the choice ( [ fhtmu ] ) , ( [ fqtmu ] ) and ( [ sqb ] ) of @xmath124 and @xmath125 functions the pt exists at @xmath126 , because the sufficient conditions ( [ sufcondi ] ) and ( [ sufcondii ] ) can be easily fulfilled by a proper choice of the bag constant @xmath127 and the function @xmath128 for the interval @xmath129 with the constant @xmath130 .",
    "clearly , this is the 1@xmath1 order pt , since the surface tension is finite and it provides the convergence of the integrals ( [ g1 ] ) and ( [ kq ] ) in the expression ( [ shprime1 ] ) , where the usual @xmath30-derivatives should be now understood as the partial ones for @xmath131 .    assuming that the conditions ( [ sufcondi ] ) and ( [ sufcondii ] ) are fulfilled by the correct choice of the model parameters @xmath127 and @xmath128 , one can see now that at @xmath132 there exists a pt as well , but its order is defined by the value of @xmath3 . as was discussed in the preceding section for @xmath133 there exists the 2@xmath0 order pt . for @xmath134",
    "there exist the pt of higher order , defined by the conditions formulated in eq .",
    "( [ nth ] ) .",
    "this is a new possibility , which , to my best knowledge , does not contradict to any general physical principle ( see the left panel in fig .",
    "the case @xmath135 can be ruled out because there must exist the first order pt for @xmath136 , whereas for @xmath126 there exists the cross - over .",
    "thus , the critical endpoint in @xmath137 plane will correspond to the critical interval in the temperature - baryonic density plane .",
    "since such a structure of the phase diagram in the variables temperature - density has , to my knowledge , never been observed , i conclude that the case @xmath135 is unrealistic ( see the right panel in fig .",
    "2 ) . note that a similar phase diagram exists in the fdm with the only difference that the boundary of the mixed and liquid phases ( the latter in the qgbst model corresponds to qgp ) is moved to infinite particle density .",
    "using our results for the case ( * iii * ) of the preceding section , we conclude that above @xmath106 there is a cross - over , i.e. the qgp and hadrons coexist together up to the infinite values of @xmath30 and/or @xmath110 .",
    "now , however , it is necessary to answer the question : how can the two different sets of singularities that exist on two sides of the line @xmath138 provide the continuity of the solution of eq .",
    "( [ s*vdw ] ) ?",
    "it is easy to answer this question for @xmath139 because in this case all partial @xmath30 derivatives of @xmath140 , which is the rightmost singularity , exist and are finite at any point of the line @xmath138 .",
    "this can be seen from the fact that for the considered region of parameters @xmath140 is the rightmost singularity and , consequently , @xmath141 .",
    "the latter inequality provides the existence and finiteness of the volume integral in @xmath142 . in combination with the power @xmath30 dependence of the reduced surface tension coefficient @xmath35 the same inequality provides the existence and finiteness of all its partial @xmath30 derivatives of @xmath142 regardless to the sign of @xmath35 .",
    "thus , using the taylor expansion in powers of @xmath143 at any point of the interval @xmath138 and @xmath139 , one can calculate @xmath144 for the values of @xmath87 which are inside the convergency radius of the taylor expansion .",

    "such a classification is useful to distinguish qcd phases of present model : it shows that hadronic and cross - over states are separated from the qgp phase by the 1@xmath1 order deconfinement pt and by the 2@xmath0 or higher order pt , respectively .",
    "here i presented an analytically solvable statistical model which simultaneously describes the 1@xmath1 and 2@xmath0 order pts with a cross - over .",
    "the approach is general and can be used for more complicated parameterizations of the hadronic mass - volume spectrum , if in the vicinity of the deconfinement pt region the discrete and continuous parts of this spectrum can be expressed in the form of eqs .",
    "( [ fhtmu ] ) and ( [ fqtmu ] ) , respectively .",
    "also the actual parameterization of the qgp pressure @xmath195 was not used so far , which means that our result can be extended to more complicated functions , that can contain other phase transformations ( chiral pt , or the pt to color superconducting phase ) provided that the sufficient conditions ( [ sufcondi ] ) and ( [ sufcondii ] ) for the deconfinement pt existence are satisfied .    in this model the desired properties of the deconfinement phase diagram are achieved by accounting for the temperature dependent surface tension of the quark - gluon bags . as was shown , it is crucial for the cross - over existence that at @xmath146 the reduced surface tension coefficient vanishes and remains negative for temperatures above @xmath106",
    ". then the deconfinement @xmath37 phase diagram has the 1@xmath1 pt at @xmath196 for @xmath197 , which degenerates into the 2@xmath0 order pt ( or higher order pt for @xmath198 ) at @xmath199 , and a cross - over for @xmath200 .",
    "these two ingredients drastically change the critical properties of the gbm @xcite and resolve the long standing problem of a unified description of the 1@xmath1 and 2@xmath0 order pts and a cross - over , which , despite all claims , was not resolved in ref .",
    "in addition , it was found that at the null line of the surface tension there must exist the surface induced pt of the 2@xmath0 or higher order , which separates the pure qgp from the mixed states of hadrons and qgp bags , that coexist above the cross - over region ( see fig .",
    "thus , the qgbst model predicts that the qcd critical endpoint is the tricritical endpoint . it would be interesting to verify this prediction with the help of the lattice qcd analysis . for this one will need to study the behavior of the bulk and surface contributions to the free energy of the qgp bags and/or the string connecting the static quark - antiquark pair .",
    "however , the qgp bags created in the experiments have finite mass , volume , life - time and , hence , the strong discontinuities which are typical for the 1@xmath1 order pt should be smeared out which would make them hardly distinguishable from the cross - over .",
    "thus , to seriously discuss the signals of the 1@xmath1 order deconfinement pt and/or the tricritical endpoint , one needs to solve the finite volume version of the qgbst model like it was done for the smm @xcite and the gbm @xcite .",
    "this , however , is not sufficient because , in order to make any reliable prediction for experiments , the finite volume equation of state must be used in hydrodynamic equations which , unfortunately , are not suited for such a purpose .",
    "thus , we are facing a necessity to return to the foundations of heavy ion phenomenology and to modify them according to the requirements of the experiments .",
    "in addition , to apply the qgbst model to the experiments it is nesseary to make it more realistic : it seems that for the mixture of hadrons and qgp bags above the cross - over line it is necessary to include the relativistic treatment of hard core repulsion @xcite for lightest hardons and to include into statistical description the medium dependent width of hadronic resonances and qgp bags , which , as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , may completely change our understanding of the cross - over mechanism .",
