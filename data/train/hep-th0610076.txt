    "+ of course , there are other alternative proposals to solve problem of final stage of black hole evaporation such as approach based on trace anomaly[14 ] .",
    "+ the idea of making spacetime noncommutative goes back to the early days of quantum field theory , at least as early as 1947 [ 15 ] .",
    "the idea was that considering a noncommutative structure of spacetime at very small length scale , one could introduce an effective ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "one of the main motivations is the hope that a nontrivial structure of spacetime at small distances may led one to quantum field theories with better ultraviolet behaviors .",
    "so , it seems that both gup and noncommutative geometry(ncg ) provide suitable framework for short distance behavior of physical systems .",
    "quantum correction of black hole thermodynamics within gup and ncg shows a similarity between the results of two approaches[16 ] .",
    "this feature has its own importance since it can provide a better understanding of the ultimate quantum gravity scenario .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to consider the effect of space noncommutativity and the generalized uncertainty principle on the short distance thermodynamics of an evaporating schwarzschild black hole .",
    "our analysis shows that extension of ordinary boltzmann - gibbs thermodynamics to very short distance systems such as planck size black holes encounters severe difficulties .",
    "these difficulties may reflect the need for a nonextensive thermodynamics such as tsallis thermodynamics[17 ] . as a possible connection between the results of two scenarios , we compare our results obtained in ncg with the results of gup to find a relation between parameters of corresponding theories .",
    "the study of the structure of spacetime at planck scale , where quantum gravity effects are non - negligible , is one of the main open challenges in fundamental physics .",
    "since the dynamical variable in einstein general relativity is spacetime itself ( with its metric structure ) , and since in quantum mechanics and in quantum field theory the classical dynamical variables should be noncommutative in principle , one is strongly led to conclude that noncommutativity of spacetime is a feature of planck scale physics .",
    "this expectation is further supported by gedanken experiments that aim at probing spacetime structure at very small distances .",
    "they show that due to gravitational back reaction , one can not test spacetime at planck scale .",
    "its description as a ( smooth ) manifold becomes therefore a mathematical assumption no more justified by physics .",
    "it is then natural to relax this assumption and conceive a more general noncommutative spacetime , where uncertainty relations and discretization naturally arise .",
    "noncommutativity is the central mathematical concept expressing uncertainty in quantum mechanics , where it applies to any pair of conjugate variables , such as position and momentum .",
    "one can just as easily imagine that position measurements might fail to commute and describe this using noncommutativity of the coordinates .",
    "the noncommutativity of spacetime can be encoded in the commutator[18 - 20 ] @xmath1=i\\theta^{ij}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is a real , antisymmetric and constant tensor , which determines the fundamental cell discretization of spacetime much in the same way as the planck constant @xmath3 discretizes the phase space . in @xmath4 , by a choice of coordinates , this noncommutativity can be brought to the form @xmath5 this was motivated by the need to control the divergences showing up in theories such as quantum electrodynamics .",
    "although there has been a long held belief that in theories of quantum gravity , space - time must change its nature at distances comparable to the planck scale , but instead of trying to modify spacetime , focus was directed to the fields defined on it .",
    "the outcome of these efforts was what is known as string theory .",
    "the strings serve to smear out the interaction in space - time and , in a sense , make the notion of a point meaningless .",
    "there is a smallest distance that one can probe .",
    "for this reason , in the context of string theories , this observable distance is referred to generalized uncertainty principle- usual uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics , the so - called heisenberg uncertainty principle , should be reformulated due to noncommutative nature of spacetime at planck scale .",
    "a gup can be written as follows[3 ] @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a dimensionless and positive parameter of order unity ( for simplicity , we set @xmath8 ) .",
    "the main consequence of gup is that measurement of the position is possible only up to planck length .",
    "so one can not setup a measurement to find more accurate particle position than the planck length , and this means that the notion of locality breaks down .",
    "in other words , we can not look inside the region of minimal length . this minimal length provides a natural cut off for underlying quantum field theory[21 ] .",
    "based on this idea , it seems that the laws of physics should be reformulated in very short distance systems .",
    "as we will show , the need for a reformulation of the planck size black hole thermodynamics is inevitable .",
    "+ after a brief overview of the conceptual preliminaries , we discuss the issue of black hole thermodynamics in two alternative approaches : gup and ncg and finally we compare the results of these two approaches .",
    "this comparison results an interesting relation between parameters of these two scenario .",
    "in this section we derive black hole thermodynamics in gup framework based on our previous works[10,11,16 ] . here",
    "we focus on mass dependence of black hole thermodynamical properties . using gup as our primary input ,",
    "we obtain temperature , entropy and heat capacity of a microscopically large schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the results of this calculations are interesting since they reflect some unusual features of systems in very short distances .",
    "+ in the current standard viewpoint , small black holes emit black body radiation at the hawking temperature .",
    "this temperature may be obtained in a heuristic way with the use of the standard uncertainty principle and general properties of black holes [ 22 ] . in this way",
    ", we estimate the characteristic energy @xmath9 of the emitted photons from the standard uncertainty principle . in the vicinity of the black hole surface",
    ", there is an intrinsic uncertainty in the position of any particle of about the schwarzschild radius @xmath10 , due to the behavior of its field lines [ 23 ] , as well as on dimensional grounds .",
    "this leads to momentum uncertainty @xmath11 and to an energy uncertainty of @xmath12 .",
    "we identify this as the characteristic energy of the emitted photon , and thus as a characteristic temperature ; it agrees with the hawking temperature up to a factor of @xmath13 , which we will henceforth include as a `` calibration factor '' and write , with @xmath14 , @xmath15 the related entropy is obtained by integration of @xmath16 which is the standard bekenstein entropy , @xmath17 however , if one consider the gup as given by equation ( 2 ) , the last two equations become respectively , @xmath18,\\ ] ] and @xmath19.\\ ] ] in equation ( 6 ) , to recover the well - known results in the large mass limit , one should consider the minus sign . as these equation show ,",
    "when the size of black hole approaches the planck scale size , it will cease radiation and its temperature reaches a maximum .",
    "this can be seen from the behavior of the heat capacity . from equation ( 4 ) , we obtain standard heat capacity as follows @xmath20 if we consider @xmath21 as given by equation ( 6 ) , we obtain the following generalized heat capacity @xmath22 these equations strongly suggest the existence of black holes remnants . as it is evident from figures 1 , 2 and 3 , in the framework of gup black hole can evaporate until when it reaches a remnant with planck mass .",
    "this remnant has zero entropy , zero heat capacity and a non - zero maximal temperature . in the existing literatures",
    "there is no obvious reason for this maximum temperature .",
    "as we will show , within noncommutative geometry considerations , this maximum temperature of remnant decreases and finally reaches to zero .",

    "+ one can show that within this view point black hole remnants are stable[12 ] .",
    "+   +   +   +   +",
    "in this section we describe the effects of space noncommutativity on the black hole thermodynamics .",
    "there are two relatively different view point to incorporate space noncommutativity in the issue of black hole thermodynamics . in one of these view points ,",
    "one considers the effect of space noncommutativity on the radius of event horizon by a simple analysis on coordinates noncommutativity[24,25 ] . in this framework",
    "one can show that up to second order of noncommutativity parameter , the noncommutative radius of event horizon has the following form[16 ] @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are components of black hole linear momentum and @xmath26 is string theory parameter related to minimal length[3 ] . within this framework ,",

    "this framework considers the effect of noncommutativity on geometric properties of black hole(such as black hole event horizon radius ) as starting point and one can obtain a modified schwarzschild line element using modified event horizon radius .",
    "+ there is another view point based on nicolini _ et al _ works[26 ] .",
    "it has been shown [ 27 ] that noncommutativity eliminates point - like structures in favor of smeared objects in flat spacetime .",
    "as nicolini _",
    "et al _ have shown , the effect of smearing is mathematically implemented as a substitution rule : position dirac - delta function is replaced everywhere with a gaussian distribution of minimal width @xmath31 . in this framework , they have chosen the mass density of a static , spherically symmetric , smeared , particle - like gravitational source as follows @xmath32 as they have indicated , the particle mass @xmath33 , instead of being perfectly localized at a point , is diffused throughout a region of linear size @xmath31 . this is due to the intrinsic uncertainty as has been shown in the coordinate commutator ( 1 ) .",
    "this matter source results the following static , spherically symmetric , asymptotically schwarzschild solution of the einstein equations[26 ] @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the lower incomplete gamma function : @xmath36 the event horizon of this metric can be found where @xmath37 , @xmath38 as it is obvious from this equation , the effect of noncommutativity in the large radius regime can be neglected , while at short distance one expects significant changes due to the spacetime fuzziness .",

    "it is important to investigate what happens as @xmath42 . in the commutative case",

    "we have considered the possibility of complete evaporation of black hole .",
    "if black hole evaporate completely , noncommutative geometry consideration leads to a negative temperature for black hole .",

    "+   +    as figure @xmath52 shows , entropy of black hole in noncommutative space has some unusual behavior , specially it attains negative values for some intervals of mass variation .",
    "this is physically meaningless .",
    "this unusual thermodynamical behavior may be related to fractal structure of spacetime in very short distances .",

    "furthermore , detection and vastly production of such black holes at lhc could then be examined experimentally in some details[33 ] .",
    "in such a scenario it would be natural that gup and ncg or both combination would now also be of order @xmath55 allowing it to be accessible to colliders , because the properties of such @xmath55-scale black hole may be influenced by ncg and gup or both combination effects , which originate at a similar scale , and if these effects are large enough to be observable in collider data output .",
