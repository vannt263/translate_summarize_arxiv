    "the understanding of non - perturbative aspects of non - abelian gauge theories is one of the main challenging problems in quantum field theories . as an example",

    "see refs.@xcite for analytical investigations and @xcite for results obtained through numerical lattice simulations .",
    "non - perturbative effects can be accounted perturbatively by considering ambiguities in the gauge fixing process , first noted by gribov in @xcite .",
    "these ambiguities , also referred to as gribov copies , are unavoidably present in the landau gauge , since the ( hermitian ) faddeev - popov operator admits the existence of zero modes .",
    "a brief introduction to the gribov issue is presented in section [ introductiontogribov ] , based on the works @xcite . with that being said , the analysis of yang - mills theories coupled to a scalar higgs field , in its fundamental and adjoint representation , while taking into account non - perturbative effects arising from the gribov issue , becomes of great aid in the comprehension of the confined / higgs transition effect .",
    "more specifically , the @xmath0 and @xmath3 yang - mills models are analysed in this work , in the @xmath4 and @xmath5dimensional cases .",
    "some general features and definitions concerning the yang - mills @xmath6 higgs field are worked out in section [ the yang - mills @xmath6 higgs field theory ] .",
    "part of the dynamics of the system can be read off from the structure of the gluon propagator , which is a function of the parameter space of each model and reflects the existence of gribov s issue .",
    "the higgs and confinement regimes are detected as follows : when the gauge field displays a yukawa type propagator the system is said to be in the _ higgs regime _ ; for a propagator of the gribov type the system is in the _ confined regime_. the confinement interpretation follows from the gribov propagator that lacks the usual physical particle interpretation , since it exhibits complex conjugate poles .",
    "as such , gluons do not belong to the physical spectrum of the theory , which is compatible with the effect of confinement @xcite .",
    "note that the `` phase structure '' in each theory turns out to be dependent on the group representation of the higgs field .",
    "the analysis of each model , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , are carried out in sections [ gfwithbroksym ] and [ the electroweak theory ] , respectively . in the last section [ conclusion ]",

    "this section is organized in a way to provide a brief introduction to gribov s ambiguities by following his seminal work @xcite . we do not intend to provide the final word on this matter and as such we would refer to @xcite for a more complete and pedagogical reference .",
    "the faddeev - popov quantization procedure is reproduced ( not in full detail ) in the subsection [ introductiontogribov1 ] , while gribov s problem will be introduced and implemented on the path integral in the two subsequent subsections , [ gribov s issue ] and [ gribovimplementation ] . in the last subsection [ a sign of confinement from gluon propagator ] , we should present one of the most important outcomes of the gribov s issue : a possible interpretation of gluon confinement , which is encoded in the poles of the gluon propagators .",
    "we should say , to clarify matters , that our present work concerns computations up to one - loop in perturbation theory .",
    "the gauge invariant action of a non - abelian gauge field , or the yang - mills ( @xmath7 ) action , is given by @xmath8 with @xmath9 being the field strength tensor .",
    "the action enjoys the feature of being symmetric under gauge transformation , which is defined for the gauge field as @xmath10 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 being the number of colours .",
    "a geometrical representation of this symmetry can be seen in figure [ fig1 ] , where each orbit , representing equivalent gauge fields , is crossed by a gauge curve @xmath13 .",
    "it means that , the ym action is invariant under transformations that keep the transformed gauge field on the same gauge orbit .",
    "as is well known , that gauge invariance of the action induces inconsistencies in the quantization of the gauge field reflecting the existence of infinite physically equivalent configurations .",
    "to get rid of those spurious configurations from the system one has to fix the gauge , which is , in the geometrical view , to choose a convenient curve @xmath13 that crosses only once each gauge orbit . in the path",

    "@xmath30 stands for the lagrange multiplier : an arbitrary scalar field ( the nakanishi - lautrup field ) . with this",
    "we have the faddeev - popov operator @xmath31 , which reads @xmath32 following the standard procedure by faddeev - popov to implement the gauge fixing , one ends up with @xmath33[{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}c ] [ { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}\\overline c ]          \\exp \\left[- s_{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{ym}}}+ \\underbrace{\\int { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}x \\left (    \\overline c^a    { \\partial}_\\mu   d_\\mu^{ab }   c^b -   \\frac{1}{2 \\xi } ( { \\partial}_\\mu a_\\mu^a ) ^2    \\right)}_{s_{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{gf } } } } + \\int { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}x j_\\mu^a a_\\mu^a   \\right]\\ ; , \\label{genfuncfp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 stands for the gauge fixing term . the ghost fields @xmath35 are anti - commuting fields with ghost number @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively . at the end",
    "we have the faddeev - popov action given by @xmath38 .",
    "let us emphasize two important assumptions made in the process to obtain :    * the gauge condition @xmath39 is said to pick up only one field configuration from each gauge orbit , representing the physical equivalent configurations related by gauge transformations ; * the determinant of @xmath40 , present in the jacobian definition , is supposed to be always positive .",
    "gribov showed in @xcite that those assumptions are not always true .",
    "furthermore , he showed that the failure of the first statement is closely related to the failure of the second one and , besides that , he pointed out the existence of zero mode configurations related to the @xmath41 operator .",
    "those subtleties give rise to the gribov issue , summarized in the next subsection .",
    "as stated before , one of the most important hypotheses is that once the gauge fixing condition is chosen , @xmath42 , for a given gauge field configuration @xmath29 , one should be able to find out only one gauge field configuration @xmath43 related to @xmath29 through a gauge transformation that fulfils the gauge condition .",
    "this situation is represented in figure [ 2fig1 ] by the curve @xmath44 .",
    "it means that we can not find gauge - equivalent configurations , related by gauge transformation , satisfying the gauge condition , which is represented by the curve @xmath45 .",
    "besides that , we can not find a situation where no one field configuration on a gauge orbit satisfy the gauge condition , which is represented by the curve @xmath46 .        while there is no known example where the curve @xmath46 does exist",
    ", the situation described by curve the @xmath45 is quite typical in non - abelian gauge theories and , therefore , it is worth analysing @xcite . to this end , let us consider two close gauge - equivalent configurations : @xmath29 and @xmath43 related by an infinitesimal gauge transformation and satisfying the landau gauge condition ( covered for @xmath47 ) .",
    "that is , @xmath48 then , we are led to @xmath49 with the following covariant derivative @xmath50 .",
    "equation does point to the existence of zero eigenvalues of the @xmath41 operator .",
    "the conclusion is that if there are ( at least ) two close equivalent fields satisfying the landau gauge , defining gauge copies , then the faddeev - popov operator has zero modes ( eigenstates associated to zero eigenvalues ) .",
    "note that for the abelian case the equation reduces to the laplace equation , @xmath51 since it defines plane waves , thus not normalisable , we are not considering this case , restricting ourselves to the analysis of fields that vanish at infinity .",
    "it is clear one needs to study the @xmath41 operator s eigenvalue . to that end , suppose the follow eigenvalue equation @xmath52 clearly , if @xmath43 is small enough then we have @xmath53 which is solvable only for positive @xmath54 , since in the momentum space we have @xmath55 . then , for small enough field configurations we do not have zero mode issues anymore . otherwise , if @xmath43 turns out to be large , but not too large , we reach the solution @xmath56 , showing the existence of zero modes . for even large amplitudes of @xmath43",
    "the eigenvalue turns to be negative ; if it keeps growing then @xmath54 reaches zero again , and so on .    in",
    "his work @xcite gribov showed that the domain of functional integration should be restricted to the first region , named `` first gribov region '' @xmath57 , where @xmath58 , in order to avoid gauge copies .",
    "it is known that this region is actually not free of copies .",
    "it has being analytically motivated that the existence of those copies inside @xmath57 do not influence physical results ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , up to now there is no way to implement analytically the restriction of the partition function to the region free of copies ( known as fundamental modular region , @xmath59 ) .",
    "the first gribov region @xmath57 enjoys some useful properties that have mathematical proof only in the landau gauge , which justifies our interest in this gauge ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "namely ,    * for every field configuration infinitesimally close to the border @xmath60 and belonging to the region immediately out side @xmath57 ( called @xmath61 ) , there exist a gauge - equivalent configuration belonging to @xmath57 and infinitesimally close to the border @xmath60 as well @xcite .",
    "it was also proven that every gauge orbit intersects the first gribov region @xmath57 @xcite . *",
    "the gribov region is convex @xcite .",
    "this means that for two gluon fields @xmath62 and @xmath63 belonging to the gribov region , also the gluon field @xmath64 with @xmath65 and @xmath66 , is inside the gribov region . * one may also show that the gribov region is bounded in every direction @xcite .    for more details concerning ( proofs of ) properties of gribov regions",
    "see @xcite and references therein .      as was discussed before ,",
    "our aim is to restrict the domain of the functional integration to the region where the @xmath41 operator has positive eigenvalues .",
    "therefore , let us define the first gribov region as the region where the @xmath41 operator is positive definite .",
    "namely , @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the fp operator , @xmath69 and the condition on this operator defines a positive definite operator , given by @xmath70 since the @xmath41 operator is the inverse of the ghost propagator , the ghost propagator plays a central role . with this being",
    "said , we are going to compute the ghost propagator till the first loop order , by following @xcite .",
    "the effective implementation of the restriction of the functional integration will be done by imposing the no - pole condition , which will become clear in what follows .",
    "the computation of the ghost propagator can be done by making use of the partition function .",
    "let us denote the ghost propagator as @xmath71 treating the gauge field as a classical external field we get @xmath72 whereby @xmath73 the ghost propagator can be perturbatively approximated by    @xmath74    whereby we can see that for @xmath75 the domain of integration is safely restricted to @xmath57 , characterising the no - pole condition .",
    "it can be proved that @xmath76 is a decreasing function of @xmath77 , which means that the largest value of @xmath78 is obtained at @xmath79 .",
    "thus , if the condition @xmath80 is ensured then it is completely safe for any non zero value of @xmath77 .",
    "note that the only allowed pole is at @xmath81 , which has the meaning of approaching the boundary of the region @xmath57 .",
    "the partition function restricted to @xmath57 then becomes , @xmath82    \\exp \\left[- s_{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{fp}}}\\right ]   \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\int [ { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}a][{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}c ] [ { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}\\overline c ]     v(\\omega )      \\exp \\left[- s_{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{ym}}}-    \\int { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}x \\left (   \\overline c^a    { \\partial}_\\mu   d_\\mu^{ab }   c^b -   \\frac{1}{2 \\xi } ( { \\partial}_\\mu a_\\mu^a ) ^2   \\right )   \\right ] \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the heaviside step function ensuring the no - pole condition . considering the transversality of the gauge field in the landau gauge and by making use of the integral representation of the heaviside step function ,",
    "one gets the following expression of the partition function restricted to the first gribov region @xmath57 , @xmath85 with the ghost form factor given by @xmath86 at the end , the final expression for the gauge fixed yang - mills action accounting for the gribov copies reads @xmath87 with @xmath88 . as mentioned before , our analytical work shall be restricted to first loop order and therefore we need only to consider quadratic terms of the quantized fields in the action given in equitation .",
    "namely , we have @xmath89 \\ ;   \\exp \\left\\{-\\frac{1}{2 }   \\int \\frac{{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}^{d}q}{(2\\pi ) ^{d } }   \\ ;   a_{\\mu } ^{a}(q)\\mathcal{p}_{\\mu \\nu } ^{ab } a_{\\nu } ^{b } ( -q )     \\right\\ }   \\ ; , \\label{zq0}\\ ] ] with @xmath90 by performing the gaussian integration of eq . and making use of the relation @xmath91 one can finally get @xmath92 where @xmath93 the factors @xmath94 and @xmath95 in front of the integral came from the trace over the @xmath23 gauge group indices and from the trace over the euclidean space - time indices , respectively can be found in @xcite ] .",
    "note that the factor @xmath95 is obtained only after the landau gauge limit is taken .",
    "in the thermodynamic limit ( when @xmath96 ) the saddle - point approximation becomes exact , so that the integral can be easily computed , resulting in @xmath97 with @xmath98 solving the equation @xmath99 which lead us to the gap equation @xmath100 note that the gribov parameter @xmath101 , introduced to get rid of gauge ambiguities by restricting the path integral to the first gribov region @xmath57 , is not a free parameter , it is given dynamically by solving its gap equation . besides , it has dimension of @xmath102^{4}$ ] and is also proportional to the space - time volume @xmath18 .",
    "consequently , in the thermodynamic limit the logarithmic term of eq . becomes null resulting in eq .. the function @xmath103 can be interpreted , from eq .",
    ", as the free - energy of the system .",
    "in the present subsection we motivate that a possible sign of confinement could be read off from the poles of the gluon propagator , putting this quantity at the centre of any further discussion in the present work . at one - loop order only quadratic terms of the action really matter , so that one can read off the two point function of the gauge field from the inverse of the operator , setting @xmath47 at the very end of the computation .",
    "namely , @xmath104 things become easier to analyze if a new gribov s parameter is defined , @xmath105 so that the gluon propagator can be decomposed , @xmath106 observe from that the gluon propagator is suppressed in the infrared ( ir ) regime , while displaying two complex conjugate poles , @xmath107 . that feature does not allow us to attach the usual physical particle interpretation to the gluon propagator . from the analytic point of view the gluon propagator",
    "has not a(n ) ( always ) positive klln - lehmann spectral representation , which is necessary to attach a probabilistic interpretation to the propagator - particles and the existence of local composite operators , related to these @xmath108-particles , displaying positive klln - lehmann spectral representation . for lattice results pointing to the same confinement interpretation",
    "see @xcite . ] .",
    "these features lead us to interpret the gluon as being confined .",
    "before properly starting to analyze the proposed model , let us state a few words on general features that are useful in this work .",
    "as mentioned before , the considered @xmath0 and @xmath3 yang - mills gauge theories are coupled to a scalar higgs field .",
    "the higgs field is considered in either the fundamental and the adjoint representation : in the @xmath0 case both the fundamental and the adjoint representation are analysed ; while in the @xmath1 case only the the fundamental representation will be considered .",
    "usually the unitary gauge arises as a good choice when the higgs mechanism is being treated , since in this gauge physical excitations are evident .",
    "however , instead of fixing the unitary gauge , we are going to choose the more general @xmath109 gauge , whereby the unitary gauge is a special limit , @xmath110 , and the landau gauge can be recovered when @xmath47 . in the case of interest ,",
    "the landau gauge is imposed at the end of each computation .",
    "the @xmath109 gauge condition reads , @xmath111 note that in eq .",
    "@xmath112 is a possible form for the @xmath30 field , defined in .",
    "the @xmath113 field is defined as a small fluctuation around the vacuum configuration of the higgs field @xmath114 , @xmath115 with vacuum expectation value @xmath116 . in order to apply the gauge condition we should follow the standard process described in many text books , @xcite . rather than a dirac delta function , as in eq .",
    ", one should put a gaussian function , @xmath117 in the limiting case of @xmath47 the gaussian term oscillates very fast around @xmath118 so that the gaussian term behaves like a delta function , ensuring the desired landau gauge . on the other side , if @xmath110 then we have the unitary gauge .",
    "needless to say , the limit @xmath47 , recovering the landau gauge , should be applied at the very end of each computation gauges , which have proven their usefulness as being renormalizable and offering a way to get rid of the unwanted propagator mixing between ( massive ) gauge bosons and associated goldstone modes , @xmath119 .",
    "the latter terms indeed vanish upon using the gauge field transversality .",
    "the upshot of specifically using the landau gauge is that it allows to take into account potential nonperturbative effects related to the gauge copy ambiguity . ] .    in the present work we should deal with the higgs field frozen at its vacuum configuration",
    " @xmath120 , @xmath121 .",
    "it is equivalent to replacing every higgs field @xmath114 in the action with its vacuum expectation value @xmath122 .",
    "since the @xmath109 gauge fixing condition only depends on the vector gauge field @xmath43 and on the fluctuation of the scalar field @xmath113 multiplied by the gauge parameter @xmath123 , the gribov procedure remains valid for the limit case @xmath47 .",
    "in the present section nonperturbative effects of the @xmath124higgs model will be considered , by taking into account the existence of gribov copies . the fundamental representation of the higgs field , in @xmath126 and @xmath127 , will be studied first .",
    "subsequently , its adjoint representation , in @xmath126 and @xmath127 , will be considered .",
    "working in euclidean spacetime , the starting action of the current model reads @xmath128 where the covariant derivative is given by @xmath129 and the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field is @xmath130 , with @xmath131 , so that all components of the gauge field acquire the same mass , @xmath132 .    by following the procedure described in the subsection [ gribov s issue ] ,",
    "the restriction to the first gribov region @xmath57 relies on the computation of the ghost form factor , given by equation , and on the enforcement of the no - pole condition , . since the presence of the scalar higgs field does not influence the procedure of quantizing the gauge field , the non - local gribov term , which is proportional to @xmath101 , is not affected and one ends up with the action @xmath133 with @xmath134 given by eq .",
    ", the ghost form factor given by and @xmath135 stands for the gribov parameter that solves the gap equation .      in order to compute the gluon propagator up to one - loop order in perturbation theory",
    "let us follow the steps described in the subsection [ a sign of confinement from gluon propagator ] . therefore",
    ", we have @xmath136 whereby @xmath135 solves the gap equation , which is obtained by the means of the subsection [ gribovimplementation ] . after computing the gaussian integral of the partition function and taking the trace over all indices ,",
    "one ends up with the following partition function , @xmath137 whereby one reads the free - energy , @xmath138 which is equivalent to . in the thermodynamic limit",

    "now , let us proceed with the solution of the gap equation .",
    "since we are working in @xmath126 , the gap equation contain a finite integral , easy to be computed , leading to @xmath140 as done in the previous section , the analysis of the gluon propagator could be simplified by making explicit use of its poles .",
    "namely , @xmath141 with @xmath142 in this way , we may distinguish two regions in the @xmath143 plane :    * when @xmath144 both masses @xmath145 are positive , as well as the residues .",
    "the gluon propagator , eq .",
    ", decomposes into two yukawa modes .",
    "however , due to the relative minus sign in expression only the heaviest mode with mass @xmath146 represents a physical mode .",
    "we see thus that , for @xmath144 , all components of the gauge field exhibit a physical massive mode with mass @xmath146 .",
    "this region is what can be called a higgs phase .",
    "+ let us also notice that , for the particular value @xmath147 , corresponding to a vanishing gribov parameter @xmath148 , the unphysical yukawa mode in expression disappears , as @xmath149 . as a consequence",
    ", the gluon propagator reduces to that of a single physical mode with mass @xmath150 . * when @xmath151 , the masses @xmath145 become complex . in this region , the gluon propagator , eq . , becomes of the gribov type , displaying complex conjugate poles .",
    "all components of the gauge field become thus unphysical .",
    "this region corresponds to the confining phase .      with quite the same process as for the @xmath126 case ,",
    "let us analyse the poles of the gauge field propagator by solving the gap equation for @xmath127 .",
    "to that end the following decomposition becomes useful @xmath152 with @xmath153 making use of the @xmath154 renormalization scheme in @xmath155 the gap equation becomes @xmath156 ~=~ \\frac{32\\pi^2}{3g^2 }   \\;.",
    "\\label{gapf1}\\ ] ] after a suitable manipulation we get a more concise expression for the gap equation @xmath157 where we have introduced the dimensionless variables @xmath158 with @xmath159 in order to have two real , positive , distinct roots @xmath160 . for @xmath161 ,",
    "the roots @xmath160 become complex conjugate , and the gap equation takes the form @xmath162 moreover , it is worth noticing that both expressions , involve only one function , _",
    "i.e. _ they can be written as @xmath163 where for @xmath164 we might take @xmath165 which is a real function of the variable @xmath166 .",
    "expression is easily obtained from by rewriting it in the region @xmath167 . in particular , it turns out that the function @xmath168 for all @xmath166 , and strictly decreasing . as consequence , for each value of @xmath169 , equation has always a unique solution with @xmath170 .",

    "therefore , we can distinguish ultimately three regions , namely    * when @xmath172 , eq .",
    "has no solution for @xmath173 .",
    "since the gap equation has been obtained by applying the saddle point approximation in the thermodynamic limit , we are forced to set @xmath174 .",
    "this means that , when @xmath172 , the dynamics of the system is such that the restriction to the gribov region can not be consistently implemented . as a consequence ,",
    "the standard higgs mechanism takes place , yielding three components of the gauge field with mass @xmath175 .",
    "note that , for sufficiently weak coupling @xmath176 , @xmath177 will unavoidably be larger than @xmath178 .",
    "* when @xmath179 , equation has a solution for @xmath180 . in this region ,",
    "the roots @xmath160 are real and the gluon propagator decomposes into the sum of two terms of the yukawa type : @xmath181 moreover , due to the relative minus sign in eq .",
    "only the component @xmath182 represents a physical mode . * for @xmath183 , equation has a solution for @xmath167 .",
    "this scenario will always be realized if @xmath176 gets sufficiently large , i.e.  at strong coupling . in this region",
    "the roots @xmath160 become complex conjugate and the gauge boson propagator is of the gribov type , displaying complex poles . as usual , this can be interpreted as the confining region .    in summary , we clearly notice that at sufficiently weak coupling , the standard higgs mechanism will definitely take place , as @xmath172 , whereas for sufficiently strong coupling , we always end up in a confining phase because then @xmath169 .",
    "having obtained these results , it is instructive to go back where we originally started . for a fundamental higgs , all gauge bosons acquire a mass that screens the propagator in the infrared .",
    "this effect , combined with a sufficiently small coupling constant , will lead to a severely suppressed ghost self energy , i.e.  the average of ( to be understood after renormalization , of course ) . if the latter quantity will a priori not exceed the value of 1 under certain conditions  _ i.e. _ , satisfying the no - pole condition  the theory is already well inside the gribov region and there is no need to implement the restriction . actually , the failure of the gribov restriction for @xmath172 is exactly because it is simply not possible to enforce that @xmath184 .",
    "perturbation theory in the higgs sector is _ in se _ already consistent with the restriction within the 1st gribov horizon .",
    "let us verify this explicitly by taking the average of with , as tree level input propagator , a transverse yukawa gauge field with mass @xmath185 .",
    "using that there are 3 transverse directions transverse polarizations in @xmath186 dimensions .",
    "positive powers in @xmath54 can ( and will ) combine with the divergences in @xmath187 to change the finite terms .",
    "however , as already pointed out before , a careful renormalization analysis of the gribov restriction is possible , see e.g.  @xcite and this will also reveal that the `` 1 '' in the gribov gap equation will receive finite renormalizations , compatible with the finite renormalization in e.g.  @xmath188 , basically absorbable in the definition of @xmath177 . ] in @xmath189 , we have @xmath190 for @xmath172 , the logarithm is positive and it is then evident that @xmath188 will not cross @xmath191 , indicating that the theory already is well within the first gribov horizon .",

    "when @xmath427 the two poles acquire a non - zero imaginary part and there are no poles with real mass - squared left . in this region",
    "the off - diagonal boson propagator is of gribov type , and the @xmath396 boson is completely removed from the spectrum . more details can be found in @xcite .      the two other gauge bosons  the diagonal su(2 ) boson and the photon , @xmath376 and the @xmath375",
    " have their propagators given by , and . here",
    ", @xmath244 is the only of the two gribov parameters present .    in the regime @xmath428 ,",
    "@xmath244 is not necessary to restrict the region of integration to @xmath57 . due to this ,",
    "the propagators are unmodified in comparison to the perturbative case . in the region @xmath429 the gribov parameter @xmath244 does become necessary , and it has to be computed by solving its gap equation . due to its complexity it seems impossible to compute analytically .",
    "therefore we turn to numerical methods .",
    "once the parameter @xmath244 has been ( numerically ) determined , we look at the propagators to investigate the nature of the spectrum .    as the model under consideration depends on three dimensionless parameters ( @xmath245 , @xmath352 and @xmath430 ) , it is not possible to plot the parameter dependence of these masses in a visually comprehensible way .",
    "therefore we limit ourselves to discussing the behaviour we observed .    in region iii ,",
    "when there are three real poles in the full two - point function , it turns out that only the two of the three roots we identified have a positive residue and can correspond to physical states , being the one with highest and the one with lowest mass squared .",
    "the third one , the root of intermediate value , has negative residue and thus belongs to some negative - norm state , which can not be physical .",
    "all three states have non - zero mass for non - zero values of the electromagnetic coupling @xmath352 , with the lightest of the states becoming massless in the limit @xmath406 . in this limit",
    "we recover the behaviour found in this regime in the pure @xmath0 case @xcite ( the @xmath360-boson field having one physical and one negative - norm pole in the propagator ) with a massless boson decoupled from the non - abelian sector .    in region",
    "iv there is only one state with real mass squared  the other two having complex mass squared , conjugate to each other  and from the partial fraction decomposition follows that it has positive residue .",
    "this means that , in this region , the diagonal - plus - photon sector contains one physical massive state ( becoming massless in the limit @xmath406 ) , and two states that can , at best , be interpreted as confined .",
    "in this work we presented results achieved during the study of yang - mills models , in the landau gauge , coupled to a higgs field , taking into account non - perturbative effects . more specifically , the @xmath0 and @xmath1 models were analysed in @xmath4 and @xmath5dimensional euclidean space - time , while the higgs field was considered in its fundamental and adjoint representation .",
    "the non - perturbative effects were taken into account by considering the existence of gribov ambiguities , or gribov copies , in the ( landau ) gauge fixing process . in order",
    "to get rid of those ambiguities we followed the procedure developed by gribov in his seminal work @xcite , which consists in restricting the configuration space of the gauge field into the first gribov region @xmath57 . as found by gribov",
    ", that restriction of the path integral domain leads to a modification of the gluon propagator , in a way that it is not possible to attach any physical particle interpretation to that quantity .",
    "the gauge field propagator develops , after the gribov restriction , two complex conjugate poles , which spoils the physical interpretation of a particle .",
    "this may be interpreted as a sign of confinement of the gluon field . in the same sense",
    "we could observe similar modifications of the gluon propagator in the probed models .",
    "in general , the poles of the gauge field propagator are functions of the parameters in each yang - mills model ( including the gribov parameter @xmath431 and the higgs self mass parameter @xmath122 ) , so that we could identify regions in the parameter space where the gauge propagator has contributions coming from yukawa type modes ( with real poles ) and/or contributions from gribov like modes ( with _ cc _ poles ) .",
    "regions where only yukawa contribution exist are called _ higgs regime _ or _ higgs `` phase''_. at the same time , regions where there is only gribov type contributions are named _ confined regime _ or _ confined `` phase''_. note that contributions with negative residue , despite being of the yukawa type , have no physical particle interpretation as well .",
    "in general we could find that the higgs regime corresponds to the region of weak coupling , _",
    "i.e. _ small @xmath245 and sufficiently large @xmath122 , reached in the uv regime . for that region of the parameter space ( coupling constant and higgs vacuum expectation value ) , where we expect perturbation theory to work , we do recover the perturbative yang - mills - higgs propagators .",
    "this is an important observation , since it means that the gribov ambiguity does not spoils the physical vector boson interpretation of the gauge sector , where it is relevant . on the other side",
    ", the confined phase corresponds to the strong coupling region in the parameter space , characterized by large values of @xmath245 and sufficiently small @xmath122 , but still keeping logarithmic divergences under control . for higher values of the non - abelian coupling constant",
    "the gribov horizon lets its influence be felt and the propagators become modified . in general , for the @xmath0 and for the @xmath1 cases , we could find an intermediate region where contributions from physical modes ( with real poles ) mix with contributions from non - physical modes ( with _ cc _ poles or negative residues ) .    for the fundamental representation of the higgs field , either in the @xmath0 or in the @xmath1 model , we could find that these two `` phases '' ( confinement / higgs ) may be continuously connected .",
    "this feature seems to be in qualitative agreement with the work by fradkin & shenker @xcite . according to @xcite one observes a region in the @xmath432 plane , called analyticity region , in which the higgs and confining `` phases '' are connected by paths along which the expectation value of any local correlation function varies analytically , implying the absence of any discontinuity in the thermodynamical quantities .",
    "according to @xcite , the spectrum of the theory evolves continuously from one regime to the other .",
    "it turns out that these two regions are smoothly connected . in our work",
    "no rigorous analysis were carried out concerning the existence of any analyticity region , given the obvious complexity of the matter .",
    "the word `` phase '' was carefully used in this work , since the existence of a gauge invariant local operator , whose _ vev _ is sensitive to a phase transition , was not probed in this work . at finite temperature",
    "the use of polyakov loop becomes a useful order parameter , and works on this subject point to second order phase transition for the @xmath0 gauge theory ( see @xcite and a more recent work @xcite ) .    in the adjoint representation of the higgs field things",
    "look quite different . besides the confining phase ,",
    "in which the gluon propagator is of the gribov type , our results indicate the existence of what can be called a @xmath271 confining phase for finite values of the higgs condensate .",
    "this is a phase in which the third component @xmath228 of the gauge field displays a propagator of the gribov type , while the remaining off - diagonal components @xmath433 , @xmath434 , exhibit a propagator of the yukawa type .",
    "interestingly , this phase has been already detected in the lattice studies of the three dimensional georgi - glashow model @xcite .",
    "a second result is the absence of the coulomb phase for finite higgs condensate . for an infinite value of the latter",
    ", we were able to clearly reveal the existence of a massless photon , in agreement with the lattice suggestion , as e.g. @xcite .",
    "that non - perturbative analysis of yang - mills theories coupled to a higgs field can be extended in many interesting ways .",
    "for instance , a similar analysis could be done considering the all - order approach to the gribov problem , known as gribov - zwanziger approach @xcite ( see also @xcite for detailed study ) , and also the refined version of it , when non - perturbative effects concerning the existence of dimension two condensates are taken into account @xcite .",
    "equally interesting is the analysis of these yang - mills models at finite temperature , which is already being carried out by some of the authors @xcite .",
