    "the massive ob stars have profound influence on the evolution of molecular clouds and consequently influence star formation .",
    "the stellar radiation and winds due to massive stars in the region can sweep low density interstellar matter , consequently forming a dense layer of gas at the periphery of regions or they can compress existing primordial clumps . in both the processes ,",
    "the matter at the later stage becomes unstable against self gravity to form young protostars .",
    "these two are commonly known processes that can induce new generation of star formation around expanding regions ( see e.g. , sugitani et al .",

    "sh2 - 294 ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) is an region powered by a b0v star and is possibly interacting with a molecular cloud , thus creating a photon dominated region ( pdr ) which can be seen towards the eastern side as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission in msx a - band ( samal et al . 2007 ; paper - i ) .",
    "using multiwavelength observations , samal et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have studied the stellar content , distribution of ionized , and dust emission in the region .",
    "they identified two groups of stars , one of which is associated with the b0v star at the center of the optically visible nebula .",
    "the second group ( termed as `` region a '' ) is situated at the eastern side of the optical cluster and near the peak of 8 @xmath0 m emission along the pdr .",
    "samal et al . (",
    "2007 ) , using the optical colour - magnitude diagram and theoretical evolutionary models , estimated the age of the ionizing source as 4 @xmath4 10@xmath5 yr , whereas low mass pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars show an age spread of 1 - 5 @xmath4 10@xmath5 yr .",
    "on the basis of youth of the sources in  region a \" ( age @xmath8 1 @xmath4 10@xmath5 yr ) compared to the age of the ionizing source ( @xmath34 @xmath4 10@xmath5 yr ) , samal et al .",
    "( 2007 ) suggested sh2 - 294 as a site of triggered star formation .",
    "however , the mechanism that is responsible for the initiation of new star formation in this region is still not clearly understood ; requires proper identification and characterization of stellar sources present in the region to put a step ahead .",
    "on the basis of high resolution near - infrared ( nir ) and optical observations , yun et al .",
    "( 2008 ) estimated the age of the ionizing source of sh2 - 294 as 4 @xmath4 10@xmath5 yr , but suggested a higher age for the pms sources .",
    "due to the absence of spectroscopic or longer wavelength ( @xmath9 @xmath10 2.2 @xmath0 m ) observations , the exact nature and evolutionary status of the pms sources in the region could not be studied so far .",
    "now with high angular resolution of _ spitzer _ space telescope it is possible to make a more reliable membership census of the young stellar objects with disk and envelope of the region , as 3 - 8 @xmath0 m bands of _ spitzer _ reduce the degeneracy between selective interstellar extinction and intrinsic ir excess .",
    "moreover , the nature of ysos can be best accomplished using their broadband seds and its comparison with more sophisticated radiative transfer sed fitting models ( e.g. , robitaille et al .",
    "thus , in conjugation with the available photometric data sets for the region , the _ spitzer _ observations will allow us to characterize the individual ysos with their seds and constrained their evolutionary status , thus will help to establish spatial and temporal relationship among the ysos .",
    "therefore , we revisited the region at near- and mid - infrared windows for the follow up study of sh2 - 294 star - forming - region ( sfr ) , to have a better picture of star formation activity .",
    "the distance to sh2 - 294 is uncertain and varies from 3.2 kpc to 4.8 kpc ( moffat et al .",
    "1979 ; samal et al . 2007",

    "in @xmath113 , the observational results are presented , which includes morphology of the region , identification of the ysos and their properties obtained with sed modelling . the star formation scenario in the region",
    "is discussed in @xmath114 and @xmath115 summarizes our results .",
    "the archived mir data for the region were obtained with the infrared array camera ( irac ; fazio et al .",
    "2004a ) on board the _ spitzer _ space telescope .",
    "irac has four wavelength bands centered at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath0 m , each of which has a field of view of @xmath35.2 @xmath4 5.2 .",
    "the pixel size in all the four bands is @xmath3 @xmath12 .",
    "the corrected basic calibrated data ( cbcd ) images were downloaded from the _ spitzer _ space telescope archive using the leopard package .",
    "the irac observations of the region were taken on 2006 november 25 ( program i d 30734 , aor key 18902784 : massive star clusters , pi : donald figer ) .",
    "mosaics were built at the native instrument resolution of @xmath12 per pixel with the standard bcds using the mopex ( mosaicker and point source extractor ) software program provided by _",
    "spitzer _ science center .",
    "we performed aperture photometry on the irac images using the daophot package of iraf , with a source detection at the 5@xmath13 level above the average local background . due to the crowded nature of the field ,",
    "an aperture radius of 2 pixels and a sky annulus extending from 2 to 6 pixels was used .",
    "we adopted the zero - point magnitudes for the standard aperture radius ( 10 pixels ) and background annulus of ( 10 - 20 pixels ) of 19.67 , 18.92 , 16.86 , and 17.39 mag in the 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath0 m bands , respectively , and the appropriate aperture corrections were made using the values described in the irac data handbook . to estimate the contamination due to non yso candidates",
    ", we analyzed a control field ( program i d 30734 , aor key 18902784 : galactic structure , pi : steven majewski ) located approximately 1.1 degrees away from the target field with no obvious signs of star formation , using the same procedure as described above .",
    "for both the fields the sources which have photometric uncertainties less than 0.2 mag are considered as good detections .",
    "this should be considered as conservative lower limit as the calibration uncertainty associated with the irac bands is 2 - 3% and in addition , there are 1 - 2% uncertainty in the aperture corrections .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the parameters are obtained from the weighted mean and standard deviation of these models , weighted by e@xmath14 of each model and are tabulated in table 2 .",
    "these parameters are obtained from set of models that represent the overall distribution , therefore more likely suppress any extreme values which may arise due to few badly fitted models . however , due to limited observational data points , some of the parameters from the model fits can be narrowly constrained over others depending upon the available fluxes .",
    "since we are mainly interested in stellar parameters due to availability of shorter wavelength fluxes , we therefore only quote few parameters from the 14 parameter space sed models .",
    "table 2 lists the star mass ( @xmath15 ) , temperature ( @xmath16 ) , stellar age ( @xmath17 ) , mass of the disk ( @xmath18 ) , disk accretion rate ( @xmath19 ) , foreground visual absorption ( @xmath20 ) and the @xmath21 of the best fit .",
    "table 2 reveals that the ages of the majority of class ii yso ( excluding 17 ) candidates vary between 1.5 to 7 @xmath4 10@xmath5 yr with a median age of 4.5 @xmath22 1.9 @xmath4 10@xmath5 yr , whereas the visual extinction varies from 3.2 to 13.5 mag , indicating presence of non - uniform extinction within the region . out of 25 class",
    "ii sources , 18 sources have fluxes at optical wavelengths , thus their age estimations expected to be better constrained , which is 5.1 @xmath22 1.4 @xmath4 10@xmath5 yr ( median age ) . from table 2 , it appears that the ysos identified in the present work are detected nearly down to @xmath3 1.8 @xmath23 and probably a large number of low mass ysos are embedded in the cloud .",
    "we note that the stellar ages given in table 2 are only approximate .",
    "spectroscopic observations of the ysos would be more accurate in the determination of their stellar age . in robittalle",
    "et al . ( 2007 ) models , the stellar masses and ages are sampled using the isochrones and evolutionary tracks ( bernasconi & maeder 1996 ; siess et al .",
    "2000 ) from the stellar luminosity and temperature , derived from the sed models .",
    "since the age determination for all the ysos is being done following the same set of evolutionary tracks and the same approach , we therefore use the relative age among the ysos to constrain the star formation history of the complex . however , we are aware of the fact that age estimation depends upon the choice of isochrones . for example , hillenbrand et al .",
    "( 2008 ) suggested use of different set of isochrones can lead to a systematic uncertainty at a level of 0.75 dex for sub - solar mass stars , though the agreement is better for older pms solar - mass stars .",
    "out of six class i sources identified in the present study , only three ( c1 , c2 & c3 ) have sufficient data points to fit the models of robitaille et al .",
    "the models predict that all the three sources are young ( @xmath8 0.4 @xmath4 10@xmath24 yr ) and have relatively massive disk in comparison to the class ii sources of the region .",
    "the age estimation of the accreting embedded protostars probably more uncertain , therefore , should considered as quantitative indicator of stellar youth .",
    "though , we do not have sufficient data to address the evolutionary status of other class i ysos ( c4 , c5 & c6 ) , however , the infrared colours of these objects indicate that they must be ir excess stars with circumstellar disk . here",
    ", we assume the age of c4 , c5 and c6 must be of the order of few @xmath4 10@xmath24 yr , which is generally attributed to this class of sources ( kenyon & hartmann 1995 ) . as discussed earlier , most of the class i sources are distributed away from the central cluster .",
    "the class i sources represent a much younger population than the ionizing source ( @xmath34 @xmath4 10@xmath5 yr ) and the associated class ii sources within the cluster region .",
    "it is also apparent from table 2 that the disk accretion rate of the class ii ysos , except few outliers , is in the range of 10@xmath25 @xmath26 10@xmath27  yr@xmath28 , which is less than that of class i / ii and class i ysos ( 10@xmath29 @xmath26 10@xmath25  yr@xmath28 ) .",
    "it is to be noted that in the absence of far - infrared ( fir ) to millimeter data the above values , particularly the disk parameters , should be treated with a caution .",
    "samal et al . (",
    "2007 ) on the basis of mid to far - infrared fluxes predicted a presence of a massive zams star in the region @xmath30 . in the _ spitzer _ image",

    "6 ( right panel ) .",
    "the sed of this yso candidate is better sampled at longer wavelengths , showing a very steep rise in the 1.22 @xmath0 m to @xmath3 140 @xmath0 m range , indicating the presence of an envelope thus the object should be a class i yso .",
    "the parameters from the best fit models suggest that the source has an age of @xmath34 @xmath4 10@xmath33 yr and mass @xmath39   with a total luminosity of @xmath31.8 @xmath4 10@xmath34  .",
    "the source is embedded in a cloud having  @xmath324 mag and is still accreting with a high envelope accretion rate of @xmath39.8 @xmath4 10@xmath35  yr@xmath28 .",
    "accreting protostars show signature of outflow in their very young age . extended 4.5 @xmath0 m emission often used as a tracer of outflow activity from massive young stellar objects ( mysos ) , as the 4.5 @xmath0 m irac band contains both h@xmath36   ( v=0 - 0 , s(9,10,11 ) ) lines and co ( v=1 - 0 ) band heads , thus can be excited by shocks such as those expected from protostellar outflows ( cyganowski et al .",
    "2008 and references therein ) .",
    "outflow sources identified based on their enhanced extended 4.5 @xmath0 m emission are known as  extended green objects ( egos ) \" and are generally identified with color coding using irac 3-colour composite images . in search of egos , we made a colour - composite ( see figure 7 ) image using the irac first three bands around the myso ",
    "the source is embedded in a pdr and pdrs are generally bright in irac 5.8 @xmath0 m and 8.0 @xmath0 m , thus adds difficulty in search for weak egos . in figure 7 , however , we did not find any enhanced emission at 4.5 @xmath0 m , indicating either the emission is absent or very weak .",
    "it has been noticed that the ysos responsible for outflows appear blue in irac [ 3.6]-[4.5]/[4.5]-[5.8 ] cc diagram and are generally located at specific position ( [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] @xmath37 1.1 mag and [ 4.5]-[5.8 ] @xmath8 0.8 mag ; ybarra & lada 2009 and references therein ) in this cc space ; thus sometimes used with caution to identify the driving sources .",
    "a comparison shows that none of the yso candidates in our sample are located at the preferred position as mentioned above , in irac [ 3.6]-[4.5]/[4.5]-[5.8 ] cc diagram ( see figure 2@xmath38 ) , indicating the identified ysos are probably crossed the outflow stage .",
    "a star of @xmath39  takes @xmath32 @xmath4 10@xmath24 yr to reach zams ( bernasconi & maeder 1996 ) and the evolutionary status ( age @xmath2 10@xmath24 yr ) of the myso based on sed models indicate that the source is still the in pms phase or about to reach zams . in the pms phase , the lyman continuum emission from a massive star is expected to be much lower than its corresponding ms phase . in paper - i",
    ", we found a radio continuum peak in the proximity of structure @xmath30 ; however , the emission is elongated along the bright arc seen in the 5.8 @xmath0 m image .",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "image reveals that massive source c1 does not exactly coincide with the radio peak , it is rather situated @xmath320   away in the eastern direction . though the resolution of the radio continuum image presented in paper - i , does not allow to conclude about the origin of the radio emission , however , we presume that its elongated structure and its offset from the source c1 possibly represent the ionized gas from the photo - evaporating layer of the externally ionized rim ( e.g. , morgan et al .",
    "the high envelope accretion rate indicates that source c1 may become more massive with time and may drive an region .",
    "star formation in a molecular cloud is more active during the first few million year of cloud lifetime .",
    "it is believed that majority of the stars in a molecular cloud form in clusters and after few million year star formation , the gas in a molecular cloud dissipates and further star formation no longer takes place ( lada & lada 2003 ) . it is found that clusters with age greater than @xmath3 5 @xmath4 10@xmath5 yr are seldom associated with molecular gas ( leisawitz et al 1989 ) , thus it is more likely that after @xmath3 5 @xmath4 10@xmath5 yr no gas is left over to form new stars . however , these type of molecular cloud complexes can still have star formation in pdrs at the interface of the region and the molecular gas .",
    "many young clusters associated with regions show age spread , which is partly due to the cluster evolution and partly due to different epochs of star formation within the region ( e.g. , sharma et al . 2007 ; pandey et al .",
    "2008 ; jose et al .",
    "2008 ) . in sh2 - 294 region , with the help of _ spitzer _ observations , we detected sources with disk and envelope , evidence of youth of the region .",
    "the presence of extremely young class i sources perhaps represents fresh star formation in the region .",
    "the sed models , within the uncertainties , indicate that the age of most of the class ii ysos are of comparable to ionizing source and these sources are certainly older than than class i ysos . all the class i sources are distributed at the outskirts of the sh2 - 294 region ; most of them are associated with arc - shaped h@xmath36 structures and pah features .",
    "the distribution of young ysos at the outskirts of regions / bubbles has been noticed in several cases ( see e.g. , deharveng et al . 2005 ; zavagno et al .",
    "2006 ; koeing et al . 2008 ; watson et al .",
    "2008 ; deharveng et al . 2009 ; chauhan et al .",
    "2011 ) , where it is believed that the majority of them are formed as a result of triggered star formation .",
    "although kinematics of the sh2 - 294 region is not available , the morphology , the association of class i ysos with h@xmath1 structures and their younger ages with respect to 4 @xmath4 10@xmath5 yr massive b0 ms star , give evidence in favor of triggered star formation in the region . on the basis of hipparcos data , madsen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) calculated the velocity dispersion of @xmath31 km s@xmath28 for stars in young clusters and associations . since the class i sources are expected to be young ( @xmath310@xmath24 yr ) , their positions should roughly indicate the place where they have born , whereas with a velocity dispersion of 1 km s@xmath28 , the class ii ysos ( median age @xmath34.5 @xmath4 10@xmath5 yr ) might have drifted away @xmath3 4 pc from their original position .",
    "therefore , some of the class ii ysos distributed away from the cluster center ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ; see samal et al .",
    "2007 ) might have drifted due to their motion .",
    "figure 5 shows the spatial distribution of ysos .",
    "the class i source c4 is associated with the structure @xmath41 and is situated at the vertex of a finger - like structure pointing towards the ionization source .",
    "a similar kind of example can be seen in the case of rcw 120 ( zavagno et al .",
    "2007 ; deharveng et al . 2009 ) , where a yso located at the vertex of a structure pointing towards the exciting star ( deharveng et al . 2009 ) .",
    "deharveng et al .",
    "( 2009 ) proposed that the structure results from the dynamical instability of the expanding ionization front , such as those simulated by garcia - segura & franco ( 1996 ) .",

    "the region @xmath30 is associated with a relatively massive ( @xmath39 ) star and is more prominent in pah emission in comparison to the region @xmath42 , which is associated with a less massive ( @xmath32.7 ) star .",

    ", we discuss the star formation as seen in remnants of pre - existing molecular material of a parental clumpy cloud due to interaction of an expanding region . in the second case",
    ", we discuss the evolution of an region in a filament and the resulting star formation . in sh2 - 294 region",

    "the structure @xmath30 shows clearly a externally heated rim , with a massive ( 9 ) source c1 inside the rim , whereas the region @xmath42 has a more globular morphology , with a less massive ( 2.7 @xmath23 ) source c3 inside . in both the cases ,",
    "the structures show cometary morphology with their heads pointing toward the illuminating b0 ms star .",
    "both the structures are approximately at the same distance form the ionizing source .",
    "the different morphological structures under the same set of initial conditions and exposed to approximately the same amount of ionizing photons , may be due to the differences in size and mass of the pre - existing clumps .",
    "several studies show the association of ysos with bright rims at the borders of regions ( sugitani & ogura 1994 ; ogura et al .",
    "2002 ) and their formation is more likely due to effect of strong external radiation from ob stars ( morgan et al .",
    "2004 ; urquhart et al .",
    "on the basis of cometary morphology , location , and age difference between the associated ysos and the ionization source , one can anticipate that radiation driven implosion ( rdi ; lefloch & lazareff 1994 ; miao et al .",
    "2006 ) could be the process of star formation for regions @xmath30 and @xmath42 . to evaluate this hypothesis we quantitatively compare the time elapsed during the formation of the class i yso ( c1 ) in the region @xmath30 with that of the age of the b0 ionization source at center . in case of rdi - induced star - formation",
    ", the pre - existing molecular clumps are surrounded by high - pressure ionized gas due to the photoionizing uv photons and the pressure exerted on the surface of the molecular clump leads to formation of a cometary globule . at an appropriate time , the high pressure will drive a shock front into the clump , leading to the formation of new stars ( for details , see lefloch & lazareff 1994 ) .",
    "we estimated the time needed for the ionization front ( if ) to travel to the present position of the rim of the structure @xmath30 situated at a projected distance of 1.7 pc as @xmath31.5 @xmath4 10@xmath24 yr , assuming that the if expands at the sound speed of 11.4 km s@xmath28 .",

    "the age of the class i source inside the rim should be of the order of 10@xmath24 yr .",

    "we also evaluated the shock crossing time to the globule to see whether the star formation in regions @xmath30 and @xmath42 started due to the propagation of ionization - shock front or whether it had already taken place prior to the ionization front arrival . assuming a typical shock velocity of 1 - 2 km s@xmath28 , as found in the case of bright rimmed clouds ( brcs ; see e.g. , thompson et al .",
    "2004 ; white et al .",
    "1999 ) for the neutral gas associated with @xmath30 , the shock travel time to the source c1 projected at a distance @xmath3 0.31 pc from the photo - ionization surface layer ranges from 3.0 - 1.5 @xmath4 10@xmath24 yrs .",
    "this time scale is comparable to the age of the source c1 .",
    "these simple approximate estimations suggest that the formation of the source c1 and similarly c3 , can be possible via the rdi mechanism .",
    "now we will discuss the bipolar region and its importance on star formation processes . in bipolar case , it is most likely that the region forms in the dense region of a filamentary cloud , where the density along the equatorial axis of the filament is high , whereas it is low in the polar directions , leading to a high density contrast . as a consequence ,",
    "matter can be more compressed in the equatorial plane during the expansion of the region , depending upon the initial density and ionization radiation from the region .",
    "a prototype example of such bipolar morphological region is  sh2 - 201 \" , where two dense ( @xmath10 10@xmath44 @xmath45 ) and massive ( @xmath10 70 ) condensations are found at each sides of the waist of sh2 - 201 ( deharveng et al .",

    "we considered those models , which include magnetic field , treat the formation of region on the filament axis or very close to it ( @xmath2 5@xmath47 ) as well as impinging the filament axis with a kinetic energy .",
    "these models predict the time required to produce two first generation cores ( @xmath52 @xmath10 @xmath53 @xmath52@xmath54 ) is less than or equal to ten times the crossing time scale , which is @xmath8 2.5 @xmath4 10@xmath55 yr in the present case .",
    "the age of the class i ysos is of the order of @xmath3 10@xmath48 yr . assuming that the age ( @xmath3 4 @xmath4 10@xmath55 yr ) of the ionizing source represents the age of region , it seems that sh2 - 294 is old enough to produce two cores , which perhaps further collapses to form the class i ysos    the above discussion , with the present limited observations suggests that both the hypotheses can be justified being responsible for triggered star formation in sh2 - 294 region .",
    "it is difficult to conclude with the present observations , which one is superior over the other , though we prefer triggered star formation at the waist of sh2 - 294 in a filamentary cloud , as the overall morphology of sh2 - 294 on a smaller scale resembles with a filamentary cloud .",
    "however , the proof of this would require additional informations such as determination of exact stellar properties of ysos with infrared spectroscopic observations , a search for in favor of possible filamentary cloud with deep fir observations and kinematics with high resolution line observations .",
    "in paper - i we studied the sh2 - 294 region and properties of the associated central cluster . with the help of low resolution radio continuum observation at 1280 mhz ,",
    "mid & far - infrared emissions from msx & hires maps and optical - nir point source analyses , we tried to understand for the first time , the star formation scenario in the sh2 - 294 region . in the present paper the high resolution _ spitzer _",
    "images along with h@xmath1 image with vlt reveal the presence of several dusty structures and four prominent h@xmath1 arc - like structures . in this paper",
    "we focus on the identification of ysos and tried to constrain their physical properties using colour-colour selections and sed fitting models . in this study",
    ", we identified 25 class ii , 6 class i and 5 class i / ii sources on the basis of _ spitzer _ colours and estimated their basic parameters such as age , mass , disk accretion rate , and extinction using sed fitting models .",
    "these parameters provide additional insight into the evolutionary status of these ysos , thus help us to establish a spatial and temporal correlation among the ysos and the ionizing source of the sh2 - 294 . the class i sources are found to be preferentially situated at the periphery of the region and are associated with h@xmath1 arc - like structures .",
    "we have also shown that the population of class i sources is indeed young in comparison to class ii yso population and b0 ms star at the center of the nebula .",
    "the class i source associated with the structure  @xmath30 \" , is a massive ( @xmath39 ) and deeply embedded (  @xmath324 mag ) protostar , accreting currently with an enveolpe accretion rate @xmath3 9.8 @xmath4 10@xmath35  yr@xmath28 . from the morphology , spatial distribution of ysos and the time scale involved",
    ", we discussed triggered star formation in the region with two possible scenarios .",
    "the overall morphology of sh2 - 294 along with the time scale involved suggest that the dynamical compression of a filamentary cloud by the expanding region , following the simulations of fukuda & hanawa ( 2000 ) , might be the cause for new star fromation in the region",
    ". however , further observations are needed to confirm this possibility .",
    "we are grateful to an anonymous referee for his / her constructive criticisms that have helped us to improve the scientific content and give a new direction to the discussion on star formation activity .",
