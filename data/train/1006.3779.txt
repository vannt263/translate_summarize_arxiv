    "let @xmath14 $ ] be the set of vertices that are within distance @xmath13 of @xmath15 ( called the `` closed @xmath13-neighborhood '' ) .",

    "@xmath12-id codes _ ; we also write @xmath5 $ ] for @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "not every graph has an @xmath12-id code .",
    "for example , if @xmath0 contains two vertices @xmath24 and @xmath6 such that @xmath25 = n[v]$ ] , then @xmath0 can not have even a 1-id code , since for any subset of vertices @xmath16 we have @xmath25\\cap \\code = n[v]\\cap \\code$ ] .",
    "however , if , for every pair of subsets @xmath26 with @xmath27 , we have @xmath28\\not = n[y]$ ] , then @xmath0 has an @xmath12-id code , since @xmath29 is such a code .",
    "hence we are usually interested in finding an @xmath12-id code of minimum cardinality .",
    "the most studied case is when @xmath30 . in this case",
    ", @xmath16 is an @xmath31-id code if and only if for all distinct vertices @xmath24 and @xmath6 in g , the intersections @xmath25\\cap \\code$ ] and @xmath5\\cap \\code$ ] are distinct and nonempty",
    ". for a fixed subset of vertices @xmath16 , we say that vertices @xmath24 and @xmath6 are _ distinguishable _ if @xmath25\\cap\\code \\ne n[v]\\cap\\code$ ] .",
    "much work has focused on finding @xmath31-id codes for infinite grids , see  @xcite . to measure how small an i d code can be , we talk about the `` density '' of an infinite grid , which , roughly speaking , is the fraction of the vertices in the graph that are in the code ( we give a formal definition of density after we prove proposition  1 ) .    in 1998 ,",
    "karpovsky , chakrabarty , and levitin  @xcite considered the 6-regular , 4-regular , and 3-regular infinite grids that come from the tilings of the plane by equilateral triangles , squares , and regular hexagons .",
    "they asked the question `` what is the minimum density of an identifying code for each grid ? ''",
    "a short proof shows that the answer for the 6-regular grid is density @xmath32 . for the 4-regular grid , cohen et .",
    "al  @xcite constructed codes with density @xmath33 and ben - haim and litsyn  @xcite proved that @xmath33 is best possible . for the 3-regular grid",
    ", the minimum density remains unknown .",
    "the best upper bound is @xmath8 , which comes from two codes constructed by cohen et .",
    "al  @xcite ; these same authors also proved a lower bound of @xmath34 . in this paper , we improve the lower bound to @xmath35 . before we prove our main result , which is theorem  [ mainthm ] , we first prove a weaker lower bound , given in proposition  [ prop1 ] .",
    "the proof of proposition  [ prop1 ] is instructive , because the proof is easy , yet the proofs of theorem  [ mainthm ] and proposition  [ prop1 ] use the same core idea .",
    "we call the components of @xmath36 $ ] _ clusters _ and a cluster with @xmath37 vertices is a _ @xmath37-cluster _ (",
    "a @xmath38-cluster has @xmath37 or more vertices ) .",
    "[ prop1 ] the density of every vertex identifying code for the infinite hexagonal grid is at least 2/5 .",
    "our proof is by the discharging method .",
    "thus , @xmath16 must contain at least @xmath39 of the vertices .",
    "we assign to each vertex @xmath6 in the identifying code @xmath16 a charge of 1 .",
    "we will redistribute the charges , without introducing any new charge , so that every vertex ( whether in @xmath16 or not ) has charge at least 2/5 .",
    "we redistribute the charge according to the following discharging rule :    * if @xmath40 is adjacent to @xmath41 and @xmath42 has @xmath43 neighbors in @xmath16 , then @xmath6 gives charge @xmath44 to @xmath42 .",
    "now we simply verify that after applying the discharging rule , each vertex has charge at least @xmath39 .",
    "if @xmath45 , then @xmath6 receives charge @xmath46 . if @xmath6 is a 1-cluster , then note that each neighbor @xmath42 of @xmath6 has at least one other neighbor in @xmath16 ( otherwise @xmath6 and @xmath42 are indistinguishable ) .",
    "so @xmath6 gives each neighbor charge at most @xmath47 .",
    "thus , @xmath6 retains charge at least @xmath48 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath16 can not contain 2-clusters .",
    "let @xmath49 be a @xmath50-cluster , and let @xmath6 be a vertex in @xmath49 . if @xmath51 , then @xmath6 has two neighbors @xmath52 and @xmath53 not in @xmath16 .",
    "since @xmath52 and @xmath53 are distinguishable , at least one of them has another neighbor in @xmath16 .",
    "so the total charge @xmath6 gives to @xmath52 and @xmath53 is at most @xmath54 ; thus @xmath6 retains charge at least @xmath55 .",
    "if @xmath56 , then @xmath6 gives away charge at most @xmath39 , so @xmath6 retains charge at least @xmath57 .",
    "finally , if @xmath58 , then @xmath6 gives away no charge , so @xmath6 retains charge 1 .    since the charge at each vertex ( whether in @xmath16 or not ) is at least @xmath39 , the density of @xmath16 is at least @xmath39 .",
    "it is instructive to note that our proof does not rely on the structure of the grid , but only that it is 3-regular .",
    "in fact , proposition  [ prop1 ] is a special case of a more general lower bound , which follows from a similar proof : any 1-id code for any @xmath43-regular graph has density at least @xmath59 .    when we study the proof of proposition  [ prop1 ] , it is natural to look for `` slack '' , i.e. , vertices that have charge greater than @xmath39 after the discharging phase .",
    "of course every vertex @xmath6 in a @xmath50-cluster @xmath49 with at least two neighbors in @xmath49 has slack .",
    "it is clear that every @xmath50-cluster @xmath49 contains at least one such slack vertex .",
    "our plan is to distribute this excess charge at the slack vertices among the vertices close to @xmath6 .",
    "we must also verify that each 1-cluster and each vertex not in @xmath16 are close to some @xmath50-cluster .",
    "this approach forms the outline of the proof of theorem  [ mainthm ] .",
    "we think our proof of theorem  [ mainthm ] could be refined to give a better lower bound .",
    "however , we think that bound would be only slightly better than theorem  [ mainthm ] , and that the proof would be much more complicated , so we have not attempted it .",
    "now we formally define density .",
    "we fix an arbitrary vertex @xmath60 and let @xmath61 denote all the vertices that are distance at most @xmath62 from @xmath6 .",
    "the _ density _ of a code @xmath16 is defined as @xmath63 we note that since each vertex in @xmath61 finishes with charge at least @xmath35 , the sum of the charges at vertices in @xmath61 is at least @xmath64 .",
    "we should remark that some vertices in @xmath61 may receive charge from vertice in @xmath65 .",
    "however , the sum of the charges sent from vertices in @xmath65 to vertices in @xmath61 is linear in @xmath62 , whereas @xmath66 is quadratic in @xmath62 .",
    "thus , we see that @xmath35 is a lower bound on the density of @xmath16 .",
    "the organization of the rest of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "2 we prove the main result .",
    "this proof consist of stating six discharging rules , and verifying that after the discharging phase , each vertex has charge at least @xmath35 .",
    "showing that each vertex finishes with sufficient charge is a lengthy task . to simplify the analysis , we state and",
    "prove five structural lemmas and three claims about the discharging process .",
    "the difference between our claims and our structural lemmas is that the claims are statements about our discharging rules , whereas the lemmas are statements about any 1-id code in the infinite hexagonal grid .",
    "so to simplify the proof of the main result , we defer the proofs of the five structural lemmas until section  3 .",
    "let @xmath6 be a 1-cluster .",
    "if @xmath6 has a neighbor @xmath67 , such that all three neighbors of @xmath24 are in @xmath16 , then we say that @xmath6 is _ crowded _ ; otherwise @xmath6 is _",

    ", there must exist a @xmath68 at distance two from @xmath6 and not in @xmath49 ( otherwise the two neighbors of @xmath6 not in @xmath49 would be indistinguishable ) .",

    "if any vertex @xmath6 in @xmath49 , leaf or center , has at least two vertices @xmath69 , @xmath70 at distance two ( and neither @xmath71 nor @xmath72 is in @xmath49 ) , then we call @xmath49 _ crowded _ ; otherwise @xmath49 is _ uncrowded_. the significance of a closed or crowded 3-cluster @xmath49",
    "is that @xmath49 will have extra help when sending charge to its adjacent vertices .",
    "we say that an uncrowded 1-cluster @xmath73 is _ nearby _ a @xmath50-cluster @xmath74 if @xmath73 is within distance three of either a @xmath75-cluster @xmath74 , a closed 3-cluster @xmath74 , or an open center of a 3-cluster @xmath74 .",
    "similarly , we say that an uncrowded open 3-cluster @xmath73 is _ nearby _ a @xmath50-cluster @xmath74 if @xmath73 is within distance three of either a @xmath75-cluster @xmath74 or a closed 3-cluster @xmath74 , or if both its leaves are within distance three of an open 3-cluster @xmath74 .",
    "we will show in lemma  [ lem1 ] that each uncrowded 1-cluster @xmath6 is nearby a @xmath50-cluster .",
    "if an open 3-cluster @xmath49 is uncrowded , has no open 3-clusters within distance two , and has no closed 3-clusters or @xmath75-clusters within distance three , then we say that @xmath49 is _",

    "needy_. whereas clusters that are closed or crowded already have extra help sending charge , clusters that are uncrowded , threatened , or needy will likely need to receive extra charge from elsewhere .",
    "[ mainthm ] the density of every vertex identifying code for the infinite hexagonal grid is at least 12/29 .",
    "our proof is by discharging .",
    "we assign to each vertex @xmath6 in the identifying code @xmath16 a charge of 1 .",
    "we will redistribute the charges , without introducing any new charge , so that every vertex ( whether in @xmath16 or not ) has charge at least 12/29 .    the outline of the proof is as follows . consider a vertex @xmath6 not in @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath43 be the number of neighbors of @xmath6 that are in @xmath16 .",
    "vertex @xmath6 will receive charge @xmath76 from each of its @xmath43 neighbors ( this is rule 1 , in the discharging rules below ) .",
    "thus every vertex not in @xmath16 receives charge @xmath35 . clearly",
    "every neighbor of a 1-cluster @xmath6 must have at least two neighbors in @xmath16 ; thus , each neighbor of @xmath6 will receive charge at most @xmath77 from @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath6 is uncrowded , then @xmath6 sends charge @xmath77 to each of its three neighbors , so @xmath6 will be left with charge @xmath78 .",
    "hence @xmath6 needs more charge .",
    "our plan is to send charge 1/29 to each uncrowded 1-cluster @xmath6 from a nearby @xmath50-cluster @xmath49 ; we will do this via rules 24 below .",
    "we will also need to prove that such a @xmath50-cluster @xmath49 does not send charge to too many uncrowded 1-clusters .    in verifying that each vertex finishes with charge at least @xmath35 it is convenient to count the charges of vertices in a single cluster together ; i.e. , for each cluster with @xmath79 vertices , we simply verify that the sum of the final charges of the vertices in that cluster is at least @xmath80 .",
    "note that the charge that a closed 3-cluster @xmath49 gives away by rule 1 is at most @xmath81 .",
    "since @xmath49 begins with charge @xmath82 and needs to keep charge @xmath83 , @xmath49 can afford to give away another @xmath84 to nearby clusters .",
    "in contrast , the charge that an open 3-cluster @xmath85 gives away by rule 1 may perhaps be as much as @xmath86 .",
    "thus , @xmath85 can only afford to give away another @xmath87 to nearby clusters .",
    "below , we define rules 24 so that each uncrowded 1-cluster receives charge @xmath88 from some nearby @xmath50-clusters .",
    "although rules 24 ensure sufficient charge for each uncrowded 1-cluster , in some cases they unfortunately require open 3-clusters to give away a total charge of @xmath89 to nearby 1-clusters .",
    "giving away this additional charge may result in a needy 3-cluster @xmath85 with remaining charge only @xmath90 ( rather than the necessary @xmath83 ) .",
    "thus , we add rule 5 , which supplies these needy 3-clusters with the necessary charge ( from nearby open @xmath91-clusters ) .    * discharging rules *    1 .",

    "similarly , if @xmath6 is not nearby a crowded 3-cluster , but lies on a 6-cycle with an open center in cluster @xmath49 , then @xmath6 receives charge 1/29 from @xmath49 and receives no charge from any other cluster .",

    "this is a necessary , though not sufficient , condition for receiving charge .",
    "before we verify that each vertex has final charge at least @xmath35 , we state five structural lemmas about the relationships between uncrowded , threatened , and needy clusters and their nearby @xmath50-clusters .",
    "we defer the proofs of these lemmas until after we complete the discharging argument .",
    "we separate these lemmas from the rest of the present proof because they make no mention of discharging rules .",
