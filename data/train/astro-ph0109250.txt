    "several studies demonstrated that arc statistics is a very sensitive tool to constrain cosmological models .",
    "for example , using ray - tracing simulations and numerically simulated galaxy clusters , bartelmann et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the expected number of giant arcs ( defined as arcs with length - to - width ratio larger than 10 and @xmath0 magnitude less than 21.5 ) changes by orders of magnitude from low density to high density universes , depending also on the value of the cosmological constant .",
    "this result , with the exception of the dependency on the cosmological constant , was confirmed by several other authors @xcite , who used spherical analytic and somewhat idealistic models to describe the cluster lenses and predict the number of giant arcs as a function of the cosmological parameters .",
    "therefore , the comparison of the expectation from such theoretical studies to the observations of strong lensing events in galaxy clusters can be used to constrain the cosmological model .    in order to make such a comparison ,",
    "a complete sample of galaxy clusters could be selected through the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( hereafter sz effect ) .",
    "this will be possible in the near future thanks to the upcoming full - sky microwave surveys , like that planned for the _ planck _ satellite mission . although other selection methods could be used for this purpose ( i.e.  through the x - ray emission from the intra - cluster gas ) ,",
    "the sz selection criterion is much less sensitive to biases due to the dynamical processes in the cluster centre , like cooling flows or merging events .",
    "upcoming full - sky microwave surveys will detect of order of @xmath1 galaxy clusters through their thermal sz effect .",
    "this effect is determined by the compton-@xmath2 parameter @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the temperature of the ionized intra - cluster gas and @xmath5 is the electron number density .",
    "the clusters detectable through their thermal sz effect are those for which @xmath6 where the integral is performed over the source area .",
    "the lower limit @xmath7 depends on the angular resolution and the temperature sensitivity of the detector .",
    "for example , for the _ planck _ satellite , @xmath7 is expected to be @xmath8 arcmin@xmath9 .    as explained in more detail by bartelmann @xcite",
    ", many sz clusters will also be efficient weak gravitational lenses .",
    "their weak lensing effects can be quantified using the _ aperture mass _ @xcite , @xmath10 which is the integral within a circular aperture with radius @xmath11 over the convergence @xmath12 , weighted by a suitable filter function satisfying the condition @xmath13    the dispersion of @xmath14 due to the finite number density @xmath15 of randomly distributed background galaxies and their intrinsic ellipticity dispersion @xmath16 was computed by schneider @xcite , @xmath17    clusters produce a significant weak - lensing effect if the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath18 is larger than a minimal value @xmath19 . assuming @xmath20 , bartelmann @xcite estimated that more than @xmath21 of the original sz cluster sample expected from _",
    "planck _ will be efficient at least for weak lensing , and many of them will also show strong lensing features .",
    "the number of arcs which is expected to be observed in the selected cluster sample can be estimated using the following information :    * both conditions , that clusters must be detectable through the thermal sz effect and be efficient weak gravitational lenses , give a minimal cluster mass @xmath22 at any given redshift @xmath23 @xcite ; * the number density of dark matter haloes @xmath24 can be modeled using the press & schechter @xcite mass function or its generalizations , like the sheth & tormen @xcite mass function ; * the lensing cross section for arcs with a minimal length - to - width ratio @xmath25 ( approximately corresponding to a minimal magnification @xmath26 ) @xmath27 can be computed for any galaxy cluster with mass @xmath28 at redshift @xmath23 and for any source redshift @xmath29 once the analytic model describing the cluster lens is chosen ; * the source galaxy redshift distribution can be modeled as @xmath30 where @xmath31 @xcite ; * finally , the differential number density of sources with a given observed flux @xmath32 can be assumed to be a power law : @xmath33 where @xmath34 in the r - band @xcite .    using these ingredients , the optical depth for the formation of arcs with length - to - width ratio larger than @xmath25",
    "is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is angular diameter distance to the sources at redshift @xmath29 , and @xmath37 is the proper volume per unit redshift .",
    "finally , the number of arcs with @xmath38 and magnitude @xmath39 ( corresponding to the minimal observed flux @xmath40 ) is given by @xmath41",
    "the crucial point in this computation is the choice of an analytic model for describing the lenses .",
    "several authors @xcite modeled them as isothermal spheres in order to measure their efficiency to produce giant arcs . in this study",
    ", we use the much more realistic navarro - frenk - white ( hereafter nfw ) density profile , and we compare the strong lensing properties of this analytic model with those of realistic galaxy clusters obtained from @xmath42-body simulations . the nfw profile has strong - lensing properties which differ substantially from the singular isothermal profile @xcite .    for this purpose , we use a sample of five clusters obtained from dark matter @xmath42-body simulations , kindly made available by the gif collaboration .",
    "these are placed at redshift @xmath43 and have virial masses ranging between @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the cosmological model is the @xmath46cdm model ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 )",
    ". a complete description of the numerical cluster sample can be found in bartelmann et al .",
    "we use that sample to perform ray - tracing simulations @xcite , placing a large number of elliptical sources at redshift @xmath51 .",
    "finally , we measure the lensing cross sections for arcs with length - to - width ratio larger than @xmath52 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : figure1 ] .",
    "the plot displays the numerically measured cross sections ( filled circles ) , obtained by averaging the values corresponding to three independent projections of each cluster , as a function of the virial mass of the lens .",
    "the error bars show their uncertainties .",
    "the dashed line indicates the analytically computed lensing cross section of nfw spheres placed at the same redshift of the simulated clusters .",
    "the numerical cross sections are systematically and substantially larger than the analytic ones by roughly two orders of magnitude .",
    "this clearly shows that spherically symmetric models , even with a very realistic density profile , fail to reproduce the strong - lensing properties of numerically modeled galaxy clusters .",
    "a possible explanation for this discrepancy is the lack of asymmetries and substructures in the matter distribution of the spherical models .",
    "in fact , the importance of both these factors for the strong lensing efficiency of galaxy clusters was demonstrated by bartelmann et al .",
    "the lack of asymmetries and substructures in the matter distribution could be compensated by adding ellipticity to the lensing potential of the nfw spheres .",
    "the spherical nfw lensing potential is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the distance from the lens centre @xmath55 divided by the scale radius @xmath56 of the dark - matter halo .",
    "we introduce the ellipticity @xmath57 by substituting @xmath58 the components of the deflection angle are then @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the unperturbed ( i.e. spherical ) deflection angle at the distance @xmath61 from the lens centre .",
    "using ( [ equation : angles ] ) , we produce deflection angle maps like those displayed in fig .  [",
    "figure : maps ] .",
    "the left panel of the figure shows the unperturbed deflection angle map for a lens of @xmath62 at redshift @xmath63 .",
    "the right panel shows the map obtained by adding an ellipticity of @xmath64 . using these deflection - angle maps in the ray - tracing simulations , we measure the lensing cross sections of the elliptical models .",
    "these are displayed in fig .",
    "[ figure : sigmae ] as a function of the ellipticity added .",
    "the results show that an ellipticity of @xmath64@xmath65 could suffice to remove the discrepancy between the numerical and the analytic models .",
    "therefore , the usage of elliptical models is more appropriate for computing the number of arcs with a minimal length - to - width ratio produced by a sample of galaxy clusters via gravitational lensing .",
    "upcoming full - sky microwave surveys will detect several thousands of galaxy clusters through their thermal sz effect .",
    "many of these clusters will also be efficient gravitational lenses .",
    "we can predict how many _ giant _",
    "arcs will be produced by this cluster sample by using analytic models to describe the lenses .",
    "we verified that spherical models , even with realistic profiles , do not reproduce the lensing properties of numerically modeled galaxy clusters : we need to include at least ellipticity in order to give a correct description of the cluster lenses .",
    "we now plan to calibrate the analytic lensing cross sections for the asymmetric nfw halo profile with numerical cluster models .",
    "this can be done by measuring the ellipticity of the lensing potential of the simulated clusters by fitting their deflection angle maps to those of perturbed analytic models .",
