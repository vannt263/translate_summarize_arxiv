    "the familiar `` copenhagen '' quantum mechanics of measured subsystems must be generalized to apply to closed systems such as the universe as a whole . that is because there is nothing outside a closed system to measure it .",
    "rather measurement situations occur within a closed system containing both the subsystem observed , and the observers , apparatus , etc .  observing it .",
    "consistent ( or decoherent ) histories quantum theory provides such a generalization .",
    "this paper is concerned with the nature of the decoherence conditions which are central to these formulations of quantum theory .",
    "the most general predictions of a quantum theory of a closed system are the probabilities of coarse - grained alternative histories from the system s initial quantum state and hamiltonian .",
    "the probabilities for alternative orbits of the earth around the sun are examples .",
    "an orbit might be described by a series of center - of - mass position intervals at a sequence of times . that description is coarse - grained because it is specified only by center of mass position and not all possible variables , because those positions are specified only at some times and not at all times , and because they are specified only within intervals and not to arbitrary accuracy .",
    "such coarse - graining is generally necessary to have probabilities at all .",
    "copenhagen quantum mechanics predicts the probabilities of histories of measurement outcomes , and the quantum mechanics of closed systems predicts these also .",
    "however , these generalizations of copenhagen quantum mechanics also predict probabilities for histories of subsystems even when these are not receiving attention from observers .",
    "the history of the earth s motion in the first few billion years of its existence is an example .",
    "not every set of histories that can be described can be assigned probabilities that are consistent with the rules of probability theory , in particular , with the rule that the probability of two exclusive alternatives is the sum of the probabilities of each .",
    "quantum interference is the obstacle . in usual quantum mechanics , for instance",
    ", probabilities are the squares of amplitudes and the square of a sum is not generally the sum of the squares . a quantum theory of closed systems",
    "can therefore be based on two elements : 1 ) an expression for computing probabilities and 2 ) a consistency condition that specifies which sets of alternative histories can be consistently assigned probabilities .",
    "a variety of conditions enforcing consistency have been proposed and studied ( see , _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for a list ) .",
    "this paper is concerned with the weakest of these  linear positivity  introduced in a seminal paper by goldstein and page @xcite .",
    "linear positivity will be described in sections ii and iii in detail , but to introduce the idea let us first recall the medium decoherence condition .",
    "individual histories in an exhaustive set of exclusive alternative histories are represented by operators @xmath0 called _ class operators _ where @xmath1 labels the histories in the set . for instance , the history in which the orbit of the earth lies in a sequence of ranges of position at a series of times would be represented by a @xmath0 which is the time - ordered product of projections onto these ranges at the different times .",
    "the class operators for an exhaustive set of histories satisfy @xmath2 if @xmath3 is the state of the closed system , the class operators can be used to construct _ branch state vectors _",
    "@xmath4 for each history according to @xmath5 the probabilities of the individual histories are given by @xmath6 medium decoherence is the condition that the branches be orthogonal @xmath7 medium decoherence is the precise representation of the absence of interference between histories .",
    "it is sufficient for the consistency of the probabilities .",
    "however , it is not a necessary condition ; weaker conditions are possible .    as a consequence of , , and , the probabilities of a medium decoherent set of histories can be re - expressed as @xmath8 the numbers @xmath9 are real and positive as a consequence of medium decoherence .",
    "goldstein and page @xcite proposed the weaker decoherence condition @xmath10 replacing , and a new assignment of probability @xmath11 replacing .",
    "linear positivity_. `` linear '' refers to the linearity of the expression for probabilities in the @xmath0 .",
    "`` positivity '' characterizes the condition .",
    "as we will review in section iii , the linear positivity condition is sufficient for the probabilities defined by to be consistent .    the reality and positivity of the @xmath9 that follow from show that medium decoherence implies linear positivity but not the other way around .",
    "linear positivity thus extends the sets of histories that can be assigned probabilities beyond those which are medium decoherent .",
    "that extension is not necessary to describe the outcomes of measurements .",
    "sets of histories describing measurements are medium decoherent , at least to an excellent approximation , as we discuss in section iii.a .",
    "linear positivity is the weakest of the general conditions for consistent probabilities of histories known to the author at the time of writing .",
    "however mere consistency with probability sum rules may not be the only requirement reasonably imposed on quantum mechanical probabilities .",
    "for example , diosi @xcite pointed out that linear positivity is inconsistent with the usual notion of statistically independent subsystems in quantum mechanics .",
    "the hilbert space of a closed system of @xmath12 , non - interacting subsystems is the tensor product of the hilbert spaces for the individual subsystems .",
    "states representing statistically independent subsystems have the product form @xmath13 where the @xmath14 are the states of the individual subsystems .",
    "the probability for the ensemble that the independent subsystems have a sequence of properties should be the product of the probabilities of the properties in the individual subsystems . while medium decoherence guarantees this property , linear positivity does not , as diosi showed and as we review in section iii.d . for the author",
    "this is reason enough to reject linear positivity as a basis for the quantum mechanics of closed systems that contain isolated subsystems .",
    "however , usual quantum mechanics does not need to be generalized for quantum cosmology only because the universe is a closed system .",
    "a generalization is needed to accommodate quantum gravity .",
    "that is because even the quantum framework alluded to above , and described more carefully in the next section , relies on a fixed background spacetime geometry for example to define the notion of time employed .",
    "but in a quantum theory of gravity spacetime geometry is a quantum dynamical variable , generally fluctuating and without definite value .",
    "the notion of an exactly isolated subsystem is problematical in a closed universe because the gravitational interaction can not be screened .",
    "it is therefore just possible that linear positivity could be useful could be useful for a generalization of quantum theory incorporating quantum gravity .",
    "it is in this spirit that we explore linear positivity in this paper , although no gravitational issues will be addressed explicitly .",
    "this paper explores linear positivity in a number of different directions .",
    "general properties such as exact probability sum rules , time neutrality , conservation laws , the relation to medium decoherence , and the inconsistency with the usual notion of statistically independent subsystems are discussed in section iii .",
    "section iv exhibits examples of linear positivity in a variety of simple , non - relativistic quantum mechanical systems  the two - slit experiment , the three - box model , a spin-1/2 system , a free particle , and alternatives extended over time .",
    "the aim is to begin a kind of phenomenology of linear positivity . in general , a much wider range of histories of this simple kind",
    "are found to be linearly positive than are decoherent .",
    "section v describes the utility of the numbers defined by even when they are not positive or less than unity .",
    "we call these virtual probabilities .",
    "alternatives with virtual probabilities can neither be measured nor recorded but can be used as intermediate steps in calculations of real probabilities .",
    "we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of formulating quantum theory in terms of both in section vi .",
    "this section very briefly reviews the essentials of the quantum mechanics of closed systems @xcite especially to fix the notation to be used in the rest of the paper .",
    "we consider a closed system , most generally the universe as a whole , in the approximation that gross quantum fluctuations in the geometry of spacetime ( _ i.e. _ quantum gravity ) can be neglected .",
    "the closed system can then be thought of as a very large box of particles and fields containing both observers and observed ( if any ) .",
    "fixed background spacetime means that a notion of time is well defined and the usual apparatus of hilbert space , states , and operators can be employed in a quantum description of the box .",
    "the quantum state of this closed system @xmath3 ( represented as a wave function of the universe ) and the hamiltonian @xmath15 describing its quantum evolution are assumed to be given and fixed .    as mentioned in the introduction , the most general objective of quantum theory for a closed system is the prediction of probabilities for the individual members of sets of coarse - grained alternative histories .",
    "the simplest sets of alternative histories are specified by alternatives at one moment of time .",
    "these can always be reduced to a set of yes / no alternatives represented by an exhaustive set of orthogonal projection operators @xmath16 @xmath17 in the heisenberg picture .",
    "these projections satisfy @xmath18 showing that they represent an exhaustive set of exclusive alternatives .",
    "the operators @xmath19 change with time according to the heisenberg equation of motion defined by @xmath15 . the state @xmath3 is unchanging in the heisenberg picture .    a set of alternative histories may be specified by giving sets of alternatives @xmath20 , @xmath21 at a series of times @xmath22 .",
    "the sets at distinct times can differ and are distinguished by the superscript on the @xmath23 s .",
    "the subscript distinguishes the alternatives within the set .",
    "an individual history in this set is represented by a particular sequence of alternatives @xmath24 and is represented by the corresponding chain of projections @xmath25 such a set of histories is coarse grained because alternatives are specified at some times and not at every time and because the specified alternatives are projections on subspaces with dimension larger than one and not projections on a complete set of operators .",
    "the operations of coarse and fine graining relate different sets of histories .",
    "a set of histories @xmath26 may be coarse grained by partitioning it into an exhaustive set of exclusive classes @xmath27 .",
    "each class consists of some number of histories in the finer - grained set and every finer - grained history lies in some class .",
    "fine graining is the inverse operation of dividing the histories up into mutually exclusive smaller classes .",
    "the class operators @xmath28 for the histories in a coarse graining of a set whose class operators are @xmath26 are related by summation @xmath29 where the sum defining the coarse - grained history @xmath30 is over all the finer - grained histories contained within it .",
    "probabilities for a set of histories are a set of numbers @xmath31 lying between 0 and 1    [ twofour ] @xmath32 that satisfy the basic probability sum rules relating finer- to coarser - grained descriptions : the probability of a coarse - grained set is the sum of the probabilities of its finer - grained members .",
    "the probabilities of the coarser - grained descriptions are then _ consistent _ with those of the finer - grained ones",
    ". applied to histories for a coarse graining of the form this is the requirement @xmath33    where the @xmath34 are the probabilities of the @xmath35 , and @xmath31 are the probabilities of the @xmath0 .",
    "the two conditions are the mathematical requirements for probabilities .",
    "the introduction described how quantum interference is an obstacle to consistency in the sense of and the need for a decoherence condition to restrict the sets to ones where it is satisfied .",
    "the next section describes the goldstein and page @xcite linear positivity condition and some of its general properties .",
    "the linear positivity condition concerns the numbers @xmath36 which can be calculated for any set of histories @xmath26 .",
    "it s convenient to call these _ candidate probabilities _ and use the notation @xmath31 for candidate probabilities whether or not their range is between 0 and 1 .",
    "because of , they automatically and exactly satisfy the necessary sum rules for the probabilities of a coarse graining of the set . however , candidate probabilities do not necessarily lie between 0 and 1 as requires .",
    "indeed , even for histories with just two times , with class operators of the form @xmath37 , there is some state in which one of the histories has a negative @xmath31 .",
    "that is because the hermitian product of two non - commuting projections always has at least one negative eigenvalue ( appendix a ) .",
    "homogeneous histories whose class operators are chains of projections as in have candidate probabilities that are less than unity . that is because the action of a non - trivial projection on a state always reduces its norm .",
    "@xmath38 there is no guarantee that a coarse graining of a set of homogeneous histories that does not itself consist of homogeneous histories will have @xmath39 .",
    "indeed , for any set of homogeneous histories with at least one negative @xmath31 , there is always a coarse graining in which at least one history has @xmath40 . however , if the @xmath31 are all positive or zero then they are also less than @xmath41 because they must sum to @xmath41 as a consequence of .",
    "genuine probabilities are therefore guaranteed by the linear positivity condition .",
    "section iv will illustrate the linear positivity condition for simple systems .",
    "but first we consider some of its general properties and in particular its relation to medium decoherence .      a set of histories medium decoheres when @xmath42 the probabilities of the individual histories in a medium decoherent set is @xmath43 as here , we use superscripts md and lp where necessary to distinguish medium decoherent and linear positivity probabilities .",
    "the identity @xmath44 [ _ cf .",
    "_ ] can be used to derive the following relation between the @xmath45 given by and the @xmath46 given by @xmath47 evidently , the two notions of probability coincide if the set is exactly medium decoherent and the last term vanishes [ _ cf . _ ] .",
    "exact medium decoherence implies linear positivity",
    ".    however , many realistic coarse grainings are unlikely to medium decohere exactly , but only to an excellent approximation .",
    "for example , a branch state vector defining coarse - grained history of the motion of the earth to an accuracy of 1 cm every second is not exactly orthogonal to a branch state vector of a distinct history .",
    "rather it is approximately orthogonal to an accuracy far beyond that to which the resulting probabilities can be checked or the physical situation modeled .",
    "approximate medium decoherence does not necessarily imply linear positivity because the second term in may have any sign .",
    "if the @xmath46 are very small , @xmath48 could be negative .",
    "( but then , approximate medium decoherence would imply approximate linear positivity . )",
    "medium decoherence can be alternatively characterized by the existence of _ records _ of the histories .",
    "there are records of a set of histories if there is an exhaustive set of orthogonal commuting _ projections _",
    "@xmath49 which are correlated with the histories @xmath26 in the following strong sense @xmath50 evidently implies the medium decoherence condition , because of the orthogonality of the @xmath51 s .",
    "conversely , if the branches @xmath52 are orthogonal , there are generally many different sets of projections @xmath53 for which is satisfied  most simply @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath53 are records only in the abstract sense specified of and need not correspond to anything like everyday records such as history books",
    ". the creation and persistence of records is an important , indeed the defining , feature of many realistic mechanisms of decoherence .      as stressed by goldstein and page , and",
    "as mentioned above , the probabilities of a linearly positive set of histories satisfy the defining probability sum rules . probabilities need to be defined by physical theory only up to the accuracy they are used . for example , we consider a prediction of the frequency of outcomes of repeated experiments to be securely tested , not if the probability of a significant fluctuation in the frequency of expected outcomes is exactly zero , but rather if it is sufficiently small . two theories that predict probabilities whose difference is well below the standard with which they are used",
    "are equivalent in predictive power .",
    "therein lies the possibility of utilizing the probabilities of realistic approximately medium decoherent sets of histories that obey the sum rules only to an approximation secure beyond all test .",
    "however , the conceptual situation is considerably simplified if the predicted probabilities _ exactly _ obey the sum rules as they do in the linearly positive case .",
    "we will return to the relation between these two cases in section vi .",
    "exact probability sum rules ensure that quantities that commute with the hamiltonian are conserved with probability 1 .",
    "the argument is essentially the same as that in @xcite but we provide a sketch of it here .    consider a quantity @xmath55 like total electric charge or total energy that commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath56 denote a set of projections onto disjoint ranges @xmath57 of @xmath55 at time @xmath58 .",
    "orthogonality of these projections implies @xmath59 because @xmath55 commutes with @xmath15 .",
    "now consider a set of histories of the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a chain of projections at times in between @xmath58 and @xmath62 onto ranges of quantities not necessarily commuting with @xmath55 .",
    "is the value of the conserved quantity @xmath55 at @xmath62 exactly correlated with the value at @xmath58 despite the intervening projections on quantities not necessarily commuting with @xmath15 ?",
    "linear positivity ensures that it is .",
    "let @xmath63 denote the candidate probabilities of the histories computed according to .",
    "the sum rules ensure @xmath64 from .",
    "if the @xmath65 s are all positive as linear positivity requires , then implies @xmath66 which is exact conservation of the quantity @xmath55 .",
    "the probabilities under discussion are probabilities for particular histories of a single closed system . when the closed system consists of an ensemble of identical subsystems , the probabilities of the closed system can be used to discuss the statistics of the ensemble when the number of its members is large .",
    "for example , with high probability , the frequency of a particular history in the ensemble should equal its probability in an individual subsystem .",
    "that is a standard result in usual quantum theory @xcite in accord with the law of large numbers . however , as observed by diosi @xcite , linear positivity is generally inconsistent with the usual notion of statistical independence in quantum theory on which such demonstrations are based .",
    "we offer a brief review of his result .    in familiar quantum theory , an ensemble of @xmath12 identical , non - interacting subsystem",
    "is represented by a state @xmath67 on the tensor product of @xmath12 copies of the hilbert space @xmath68 of the individual subsystems .",
    "a closed system with a state can be thought of as an approximate model for a realistic ensemble of identical subsystems .",
    "alternatively , even when @xmath3 refers to the universe , can be thought of as describing a fictitious ensemble of universes whose frequencies can be expected to coincide with the probabilities of the individual members in the limit of large @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath26 denote the class operators acting on @xmath68 for a set of alternative , coarse - grained histories of a subsystem .",
    "the class operator for @xmath12 different histories @xmath69 in the ensemble is @xmath70 [ we employ a superscript to distinguish histories @xmath71 of different subsystems each of which may consist of a sequence of alternatives _",

    "suppose that the set of histories @xmath26 of a subsystem is medium decoherent so that in particular [ _ cf .",
    "_ ] @xmath74 then for the ensemble , evidently @xmath75 the subsystems are therefore statistically independent .",
    "this is the central fact in deriving the result that for a very large ensemble the frequency of an individual history @xmath0 approaches its probability @xmath76 in an individual subsystem .",
    "however , linear positivity does not yield the same notion of statistical independence .",
    "that is because [ _ cf . _ ] @xmath77 . \\end{split } \\label{threesixteen}\\ ] ] but the real part of a product is not generally the product of the real parts unless the individual factors are all real .",
    "thus @xmath78    the absence of general equality in does not mean that linear positivity incorrectly predicts the frequencies of the histories of the outcomes of measurements carried out on ensembles of idential subsystems of the universe .",
    "exactly measured or exactly recorded alternatives are exactly medium decoherent and then becomes an equality [ _ cf .",
    "however , for many realistic sets of alternative histories , including those describing the quasiclassical realm of everyday experience , medium decoherence and records are correlated with the alternatives they record only to excellent approximations . in such cases",
    "the will only be an equality to a related approximation .",
    "there is a second reason that linear positivity does not incorrectly predict the frequencies of individual histories in an ensemble of identical subsystems .",
    "linear positivity fails for ensembles with a sufficiently large number of identical subsystems even if it is satisfied for the individual members unless the @xmath79 are real and satisfied as consequence .",

    "but , as with medium decoherence , is likely to be satisfied only to an excellent approximation for realistic coarse grainings defining the quasiclassical realm .",
    "the conflict between the usual notion of independent subsystems and linear positive probabilities is a serious obstacle to their interpretation when they are not associated with medium decoherent sets of histories .",
    "for example , we can not understand them as frequencies in an imaginary ensemble identical copies of the closed system as described above .",
    "indeed , it would not be unreasonable to impose as a _ condition _ for a construction of probabilities in quantum mechanics thereby ruling out linear positivity .",
    "however , all this does not mean linear positive probabilities can not be useful as we discuss in section vi .",
    "quantum theory is usually formulated with an arrow of time .",

    "virtual probabilities can be employed in the calculation of real ones .",
    "probabilities predicted for exactly recorded histories are always real_. this is a simple and general formulation whose utility we describe in the next section .",
    "linear positivity and medium decoherence are special cases .",
    "four decoherence conditions restricting the sets of alternative coarse - grained histories to which quantum mechanics predicts probabilities have been considered in this paper . in order of increased restriction ( roughly inverse to the order presented )",
    "they are :    * _ extended probabilities ( ep ) _ + assign probabilities to all sets of alternative coarse - grained histories according to @xmath349 whether they are real ( between 0 and 1 ) or virtual .",
    "this is no restriction at all .",
    "calculate the probabilities of exactly recorded alternatives , or the frequencies of repeated independent alternatives , secure in the knowledge that these will be between 0 and 1 . *",
    "_ linear positivity ( lp ) _ + assign probabilities only to sets of alternative coarse - grained histories for which all candidate probabilities in the set given by lie in the range 0 to 1 of real probabilities . *",
    "_ real linear positivity ( rlp ) _ + assign probabilities only to sets of alternative coarse grained histories which are linearly positive and for which @xmath350   \\approx 0 , \\quad   \\text{all $ \\alpha$ , } \\label{sixonea}\\ ] ] either exactly or approximately well beyond the standard with which the resulting probabilities are used . * _ medium decoherence ( md ) _ + assign probabilities only to sets of alternative coarse - grained histories for which the branch state vectors for all histories in the set are mutually orthogonal @xmath351 either exactly , or to an approximation well beyond the standard with which the resulting probabilities are used . calculate probabilities either by or by @xmath352 which are equivalent if medium decoherence is exact .",
    "probabilities defined by necessarily lie between 0 and 1 .",
    "this concluding section compares these different decoherence conditions .    as information gathering and utilizing systems ( igus s ) ,",
    "we employ almost exclusively coarse grainings of the usual quasiclassical realm . by the usual quasiclassical realm , we mean roughly histories of coarse - grained alternatives defined by ranges of values of averages of densities of approximately conserved quantities ( such as energy , momentum , etc . ) over suitable volumes . with the initial condition and hamiltonian of our universe",
    ", the volumes can be chosen large enough that the histories are medium decoherent and yet small enough to supply a reasonably fine - grained description of the universe over a wide range of time and distance scale .",
    "individual histories of this realm exhibit patterns of correlations in time governed by effective classical equations of motion interrupted by frequent small quantum fluctuations and occasional major ones .    for practical purposes it might be possible to restrict the predictions of quantum theory to the usual quasiclassical realm .",
    "indeed , in some loose sense , this was the view of founders of the subject such as bohr and heisenberg .",
    "but it so far has been difficult to give the usual quasiclassical realm a precise definition despite the considerable steps that have been taken in that direction @xcite . for reasons of generality , convenience , and completeness",
    "it has proved useful to formulate quantum theory with weaker , less anthropocentric , but more precise conditions that allow many more sets of histories that are nothing like the usual quasiclassical realm .",
    "the three conditions discussed in this paper are examples .    moving between ep , lp , rlp , and md in the of increasing restriction is moving toward the usual quasiclassical realm .",
    "for example , the virtual probabilities of ep for non - equal values of a quantity commuting with the hamiltonian at two different times may not be zero if other alternatives intervene as in .",
    "but they are zero under the more restrictive lp conditions as the discussion in section iii.c shows .",
    "the conditions rlp and md are consistent with the usual notions of statistical independence of identical subsystems ; ep and lp are not .",
    "the conditions ep , lp and rlp are time - neutral , but the more restrictive md incorporates an arrow of time as discussed in section iii.c .",
    "this arrow allows individual histories to be described as a narrative in which one event is followed by another , then another , etc .",
    "quantum theory then can be formulated in terms of an evolving state , and prediction distinguished from retrodiction .",
    "for example , consider a medium decoherent set of histories defined by alternatives @xmath20 , @xmath353 at a series of times @xmath354 . at any intermediate time @xmath355",
    ", we can calculate the conditional probability @xmath356 for future alternatives @xmath357 given that @xmath358 have already happened by @xmath359 where @xmath360 events to the future of @xmath355 can be predicted just from the state @xmath361 representing the present . in the heisenberg picture used here ,",
    "that state is constant in time except when interrupted by the action of projections ( `` reductions '' ) representing the alternatives .",
    "the past can not be retrodicted just from a state in the present , but requires in addition the state @xmath3 .",
    "a similar statement holds for the future in the context of lp or ep in general ( see , _",
    ". it could not be otherwise since these formulations are time - neutral .",
    "histories of the usual quasiclassical realm are medium decoherent because of physical mechanisms which dissipate phases between branches @xcite that result from the interaction between the variables followed in the usual quasiclassical coarse graining and ones ignored constituting an environment or bath in simple models .",
    "these interactions create records of the histories @xcite and the existence of records is a general characterization of medium decoherence as we saw in section iii.a .",
    "the restriction to medium decoherence is thus consistent with the usual quasiclassical realm .    imposing restrictive decoherence conditions like medium and strong decoherence @xcite are useful first steps in defining classicality .",
    "but the weaker conditions ( lp ) and ( ep ) also have their uses .",
    "an example is approximate medium decoherence .",
    "as mentioned above , the branch state vectors of the usual quasiclassical realm are not expected to be exactly orthogonal , but only to an approximation good well beyond the standard to which the resulting approximate probabilities can be used .",
    "some are uneasy about basing a fundamental formulation of quantum mechanics on _ approximate _ medium decoherence @xcite .",
    "is there a formulation of the quantum mechanics of closed systems free from any approximate notion of decoherence for realistic coarse grainings ? there is ; consider the following possibility : regard linear positivity ( or ep ) as the fundamental rule determining the probabilities of histories in quantum mechanics .",
    "the resulting probabilities satisfy the sum rules exactly as discussed in section iii.b .",
    "medium decoherence then becomes an approximate notion , useful in characterizing classicality , giving through an approximation to the fundamental probabilities .",
    "the degree of approximation can be calculated from .",
    "no practical calculation of the probabilities of the quasiclassical realm or its coarse grainings is likely to be affected by adopting this viewpoint .",
    "a consequence , however , is that many more sets of coarse - grained alternative histories nothing like the quasiclassical realm are incorporated into the theory beyond the already large number allowed by approximate medium decoherence .",
    "a further consequence is that connection between probabilities and the frequencies of even imaginary ensembles of independent subsystems is lost in general as discussed in section iii.d .",
    "precision is achieved at the consequence of extending the complementary descriptions of the world and possibly at the expense of any general frequency interpretation of the resulting probabilities .    a more important reason for considering linear positivity or extended probabilities as a fundamental bases for quantum theory lies in their potential for further generalization . the quantum theory of closed systems summarized in section ii may need to be further generalized to incorporate quantum gravity .",
    "that is because the framework in section ii relies on a notion of time supplied by a fixed background spacetime geometry .",
    "but , in general relativity , spacetime geometry is a dynamical variable that generally will fluctuate and be without a definite value in a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "a generalization of the usual quantum framework is required .",
    "generalized quantum theory @xcite provides a natural framework for constructing generalizations of usual quantum theory that incorporates medium decoherence .",
    "generalizations suitable for quantum gravity have been considered by a number of authors ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . but",
    "generalizations based upon extended probabilities would provide even greater scope . indeed a general quantum mechanical theory could be specified just by giving a real valued function for candidate probabilities on the sets of fine - grained histories .",
    "`` cheshire puss [ said alice]  would you tell me please , which way should i go from here ? that depends a good deal on where you want to get to , said the cat '' .    conversations with murray gell - mann over a long period of time were helpful .",
    "thanks are due to todd brun , shelly goldstein , jonathan halliwell , mark srednicki , and gary horowitz for useful discussions .",
    "the work was supported in part by the national science foundation under grant phy00 - 70895 .",
    "the hermitian part of the product of two non - commuting projections has at least one negative eigenvalue .",
    "this appendix gives a proof of this undoubtedly well - known fact that the author learned from g.t .",
    "horowitz .",
    "let @xmath362 and @xmath363 be the two non - commuting projections and let @xmath364 denote their hermitian product .",
    "let @xmath365 and @xmath366 denote the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath367 .",
    "the expectation value in a state @xmath3 is @xmath368 if there is one vector @xmath3 for which @xmath369 is negative then @xmath367 must have one negative eigenvalue since otherwise is positive .",
    "we now construct such a vector .",
    "any vector @xmath3 can be divided into orthogonal vectors @xmath370 and @xmath371 that lie in the subspace @xmath362 and the subspace orthogonal to it , _ viz .",
    "_ @xmath372 we now show how to pick @xmath371 and @xmath370 to make @xmath373 negative .    with the decomposition @xmath374 .",
    "\\label{athree}\\ ] ] for given @xmath370 , @xmath375 can not be orthogonal to every vector in @xmath362 , or @xmath363 would commute with @xmath362 contrary to assumption .",
    "therefore pick @xmath371 so that @xmath376 is non - vanishing . if @xmath377 replace @xmath371 by @xmath378 so that @xmath379 . now make @xmath371 large enough that the negative second term in is larger than the positive first term .",
    "the result is a @xmath3 such that @xmath380 .",
    "the case of two one - dimensional projections @xmath381 but with @xmath382 gives a concrete illustration of the above result .",

    "the two eigenvalues are @xmath385 since @xmath386 , @xmath387 is evidently negative unless @xmath388 or @xmath389 . in either of these cases the projectors commute .",
