    "equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in the main text present a model for the area - averaged concentration in a channel . in this model axial transport of ions is considered via diffusion and electromigration including migration of excess ions shielding the wall charge , but the effects of flow is ignored ( streaming current ) .",
    "we here present an estimate of this effect in the simplest form and show that consistent with our assumption , this effect is negligible for sufficiently thin dead end channels .    it should be noted that the relative importance of streaming current in surface conduction in the context of thin double layer is well established in the literature .",
    "for example , deryagin and dukhin@xmath97 used the gouy - chapman edl model and derived analytical expressions for streaming current carried by electroosmotic flow . following a similar analysis",
    "one could show that the ratio of the streaming current to current carried by electro migration of excess counterions shielding the wall charge is : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the material peclet number and property of the solution .",
    "this analysis however , is not applicable to the case of channels considered in our studies ; when channels themselves are thin , the thin edl assumption will be violated due to overlap edl effects .",
    "in addition , the pressure driven flow , which would cancel the net electroosmotic flow for dead - end channels , will contribute to current .",
    "to remedy these issues we carried out a separate analysis specific to the case of dead - end thin channels .",
    "one can consider a channel with high aspect ratio ( @xmath100 ) ; therefore the competing flow components , i.e. pressure driven and electroosmotic flow , can be assumed to be locally parallel .",
    "furthermore , the edls ( either overlapped or non - overlapped ) can be assumed to be in local equilibrium@xmath101 .",
    "therefore , the charge distribution can be estimated from solution of the poisson - boltzmann equation with top and bottom wall condition as known surface charge , @xmath102 .",
    "these solutions determine the distribution of the potential and charge in the wall - normal direction .",
    "having such solutions one can determine the velocity profile associated with the electro - osmotic flow : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the axial electric field , and @xmath105 is the local potential difference in the wall - normal direction .",
    "the pressure driven flow is assumed to have a parabolic profile with a vanishing net flow .",
    "in such a scenario , near the walls the electro - osmotic flow dominates the pressure driven flow and advects the charged double layers forward ; in the middle section , the pressure driven flow wins , but the available charge is much less than that near the wall . therefore",
    ", the flow would contribute a net current to the system .",
    "this net current is proportional to the flow , which itself is proportional to the applied field , and thus has an ohmic effect .",
    "this problem can be solved in the general form .",
    "the two dimensionless parameters associated with the poisson - boltzmann system are : @xmath106 , debye length over channel thickness , and @xmath107 , the dimensionless wall charge .",
    "the current contribution of the flow , becomes more important in the limit of highly depleted channel , i.e. @xmath108 , and @xmath109 . in this limit",
    ", the meaningful controlling parameter is @xmath110 which is finite and independent of the bulk concentration .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the net streaming current as a function of @xmath111 from our analysis and contrasts it to the prediction of thin edl model ( eq .  [ eq : thinedl ] ) , which is clearly shown to overestimate the effect of streaming current .    for a one micron thin channel with surface charge @xmath112=1mc",
    ", @xmath111 will be about 30 ; assuming an aqueous solution at room temperature ( pe@xmath1130.5 ) the current contribution by the flow is estimated to be about 15% of current by the electromigration of the surface charge . in this case",
    "ignoring the streaming current is marginally valid , and the approximation significantly improves as one uses thinner channels , however , for larger channels ( or larger surface charge ) the streaming current should be considered in the model ( in simplest form , as a prefactor enhancing the surface conduction effect ) .    , for @xmath114 .",
    "current is normalized by the current associated with electromigration of the surface shielding charge , @xmath115 ( per channel width ) .",
    "the plotted result is valid for all @xmath116 within plotting accuracy.,width=240 ]",
    "here we derive in more detail the scaling relation eq.(9 ) for the over - limiting conductance due to electro - osmotic flow on the side - walls of the microchannel , which leads to a pressure - driven backflow from the impermeable membrane end of the microchannel .",
    "the resulting vortex pair drives the fast convection of salty solution to the membrane along the walls and the return of depleted solution back into the microchannel ( fig .",
    "it is tempting to analyze convection - diffusion in this flow by area - averaging using the theory of taylor - aris dispersion , but we shall see that convective mixing in the transverse direction is not fully developed in the vortex region and leads to different scalings with system parameters .",
    "electro - osmotic flow near the channel wall scales as @xmath117 where the zeta potential , @xmath118 , is related to the surface charge density using the thin diffuse - layer capacitance ( @xmath119 ) , and the tangential potential gradient , @xmath120 , is related to the current density , @xmath22 : @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the debye length and @xmath123 is the bulk conductivity , each depending on the local bulk salt concentration @xmath124 .    combining these equations",
    ", we obtain the velocity scaling @xmath125    near the dead end , the flow recirculates and produces a vortex which shears the fluid over a transverse scale @xmath6 ( the channel thickness ) and longitudinal scale @xmath126 ( the vortex center ) .",
    "the concentration is strongly depleted by the selective surface ( e.g. membrane ) near the end of the channel , where the electric field driving the flow is at maximum . near this end",
    "the flow turns and , upon moving away from the end , eventually develops into a plane parallel slip / pressure driven flow for which the vortex center location is similar to an entrance length .",
    "this result is reminiscent of the convection - diffusion problem for the evaluation of the entrance length of a cold fluid entering a hot parallel - plate pipe . in our terms , the length of the diffusion scale is the channel thickness @xmath6 , while the longitudinal convection scale is the vortex center location ( the entrance length ) @xmath126 .",
    "the convection - diffusion equation , @xmath127 , yields the scaling @xmath128 which implies @xmath129    next , we introduce dimensionless quantities , denoted by tilde accents .",
    "let us employ the channel length @xmath5 for the length scale , @xmath21 for the potential , and thus the electro - viscous scale , @xmath130 for the velocity scale .",
    "let us also scale concentration to the bulk reservoir concentration @xmath7 at the open end of the channel .",
    "assume an @xmath4 electrolyte with equal diffusivities and an ideally cation selective surface .",
    "this yields the following expression for conductivity and debye length , @xmath131 the dimensionless values for current , height and surface charge , are defined as @xmath132 this nondimensionalization yields two crucial parameters the  material pclet number \" , , ( @xmath133 for aqueous solutions at room temperature ) and dimensionless debye length , @xmath134 , at the entrance to the channel , defined as @xmath135    with these definitions , the scaling of the vortex center takes the dimensionless form @xmath136    the only unknown in the scaling ( [ eq : scale ] ) is the dimensionless concentration in the mixed depleted region . using the numerically determined relationship @xmath137 which is valid in the weakly overlimiting regime ( section 2 below ) , we obtain @xmath138 where the coefficient of proportionality is approximately 0.3 from simulations . as this equation is applicable only in the weakly overlimiting regime ( @xmath139 )",
    ", the current density does not affect the scaling of the overlimiting conductance . if we were to keep the current from our derivation and still use ( [ eq : c ] ) , then we would obtain @xmath140 for very large currents , @xmath141 , in place of ( [ eq : l ] ) .    to compare the eof vortex mechanism for over - limiting current ( dominant for wide channels ) to the mechanism of surface conduction ( dominant in narrow channels ) in the weakly overlimiting regime , we consider the dimensionless parameter @xmath142 , @xmath143 which is the ratio of the two different possible depth - averaged conductivities in the depleted region , where @xmath144 is the scaling of the limiting conductivity due to surface conduction .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : c])-([eq : l ] ) and the simulation results , we obtain @xmath145 which depends on the channel dimensions , surface charge density , and reservoir salt concentration as @xmath146 for sufficiently narrow and long channels , thick double layers , large surface charge density , and/or small reservoir concentration , @xmath88 , surface conduction is the dominant mechanism for over - limiting current . in the opposite limit , @xmath89 ,",

    "conditions ( [ 3 ] ) at the perfect cation - selective membrane / solution interface are those of vanishing anions flux and continuity of the electrochemical potential of cations across the interface , along with the non - slip condition ; @xmath155 is the dimensionless fixed charge density in the membrane and @xmath156 is once more the potential drop across the diffusion layer .",

    "4a we present plot of the dimensionless concentration of the depleted bulk @xmath64 versus @xmath75 which shows a sharp decrease of @xmath162 for @xmath75 above some threshold due to the increasing insensitivity of the middle part of the channel to the wall - induced eof . in fig .",

    "comparison with the 2d simulations allows us to roughly confirm the scaling relation ( [ eq : l ] ) and fit the prefactor .",
    "we can also begin to understand the appearance of a weak nonlinearity in the 2d simulation results ( fig .",
    "3c , main text ) , where the over - limiting conductance due to eof grows slowly with voltage .",
