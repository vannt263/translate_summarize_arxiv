    "among transition - metal oxides with perovskite structure abo@xmath2 the compound lacoo@xmath2  is of particular interest because it shows a spin - state transition as a function of temperature . in its ground state",
    "lacoo@xmath2  is a non - magnetic insulator , but with increasing temperature a paramagnetic insulating state continuously develops above about 50k and around 500k an insulator - to - metal transition is observed .",
    "the spin - state transition may be attributed to the fact that co@xmath3 with 3d@xmath6 configuration can occur in different spin states depending on the ratio of hund s rule coupling and crystal field splitting .",
    "the ground state of lacoo@xmath2  is usually attributed to the low - spin configuration of co@xmath3 ( ls : @xmath7 ; s=0 ) .",
    "however , the question whether the paramagnetic behavior above 100k arises from a thermal population of the high - spin state ( hs : @xmath8 ; s=2 ) or of the intermediate - spin state ( is : @xmath9 ; s=1 ) is subject of controversial discussions .",
    "earlier publications  @xcite often assume a population of the hs state whereas more recent investigations  @xcite often favor a ls / is scenario .",
    "another aspect of cobaltates that is controversially discussed in literature is the influence of charge carrier doping which can be obtained by partial substitution of three - valent la@xmath3 by divalent alkaline earth metals such as ca@xmath4 , sr@xmath4 , or ba@xmath4 .",
    "most studies concern the la@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2-series , where it is found that the non - magnetic ground state is rapidly suppressed with increasing @xmath5 . for small @xmath5 a spin - glass behavior",
    "is observed at low temperatures whereas larger doping leads to a ferromagnetic order.@xcite the resistivity strongly decreases with @xmath5 and above @xmath10 metallic behavior is observed .",
    "these qualitative features are always found in studies on la@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2 , but the detailed phase diagrams presented so far are contradictory.@xcite in some samples the transition temperatures to a spin glass or a ferromagnetic state monotonously increase with increasing sr content,@xcite whereas other samples show anomalies around 250k which occur almost independent of the sr content for @xmath11.@xcite it has been proposed that these differences arise from different preparation techniques.@xcite moreover , it is not clarified which spin states are present and whether or not spin - state transitions take place as a function of temperature in the sr - doped systems.@xcite    the electronic and magnetic properties of doped lacoo@xmath2  will not depend on the charge carrier concentration alone but also on structural parameters resulting e.g.  from chemical pressure . during the last decade the interplay between charge carrier doping and chemical pressure has been intensively studied in doped manganites and a broad variety of fascinating physical phenomena has been observed ( for recent reviews see e.g.  [ ] ) . for doped cobaltates",
    "there are only a few studies on la@xmath0ba@xmath1coo@xmath2  [ ] and la@xmath0ca@xmath1coo@xmath2  [ ] .",
    "these data indicate qualitative similarities between ca , sr , and ba doping with respect to the suppression of the non - magnetic ground state and to the occurrence of some kind of magnetic order . in this paper",
    "we present a comparative study of the structural data as well as magnetization and resistivity measurements of the series la@xmath0ca@xmath1coo@xmath2 , la@xmath0ba@xmath1coo@xmath2 , and la@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2 .",
    "our samples were prepared by a standard solid - state reaction using la@xmath12o@xmath2 , co@xmath2o@xmath13 and mco@xmath2 ( m  =  ca , sr , ba ) as starting materials .",
    "the materials were mixed in the prescribed ratio and calcined in a pt crucible at 850@xmath14c  for 48h in air .",
    "then the material was repeatedly reground and sintered at 1200@xmath14cfor 40h in air . for a bare polycrystal preparation",
    "the material was finally pressed to cylindrical pellets ( @xmath15 mm ; @xmath16 mm ) by 7.5kbar and sintered at 1200@xmath14c  for 40h in oxygen flow . for a single crystal growth",
    "the polycrystalline material was pressed to a cylinder ( @xmath17 mm ; @xmath18 cm ) by 2kbar and sintered once more at 1200@xmath14c  for 20h in air .",
    "single crystals of la@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2  with @xmath19 were grown by the traveling zone method in a 4-mirror image furnace ( fz - t-10000-h - vi - vp , crystal systems inc . ) under oxygen atmosphere of 5bar with typical growth velocities of 3.5mm / h . all crystals are single phase as confirmed by powder x - ray diffraction and the sr content , determined by energy dispersive x - ray diffraction ( edx ) , agrees within few percent to the nominal composition .",
    "single crystallinity was confirmed by neutron diffraction and by laue photographs .",
    "however , all crystals are heavily twinned as it is usually the case for slightly distorted perovskites .    in this way we also prepared single phase polycrystals of ba- and ca - doped la@xmath0m@xmath1coo@xmath2  with @xmath20 . however , a single crystal growth turned out to be much more difficult in these cases . from la@xmath0ba@xmath1coo@xmath2  we prepared a large single crystal with @xmath21 , but a growth starting with @xmath22 broke down after 2 cm and the obtained rod had a ba content of only @xmath23 .",
    "this problem was even more severe for la@xmath0ca@xmath1coo@xmath2 .",
    "growth efforts starting with @xmath24 and @xmath25 yielded crystals with ca contents of only @xmath26 , whereas the edx analysis of the remaining melts of these efforts revealed ca contents up to @xmath27 .",
    "therefore we suspect solubility limits of ca and ba around @xmath26 and @xmath28 for our growth conditions,@xcite whereas significantly higher doping concentration can be reached by a pure solid - state reaction .",
    "the measurements presented below were performed on polycrystals of la@xmath0ba@xmath1coo@xmath2  and la@xmath0ca@xmath1coo@xmath2  whereas in the case of la@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2  single crystals have been investigated .",

    "the solid lines are calculated intensities .",
    "there is a structural change of la@xmath0ca@xmath1coo@xmath2  from rhombohedral ( @xmath32 for @xmath33 ) to orthorhombic symmetry ( @xmath34 for @xmath35).,width=302 ]    the diffraction patterns of la@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2  and la@xmath0ba@xmath1coo@xmath2  can be indexed by a rhombohedral unit cell containing 2 formula units ( space group @xmath32 ) .",
    "we note that a recent high - resolution single crystal x - ray study of the undoped lacoo@xmath2  revealed a small monoclinic distortion , which is related to a jahn - teller effect of the thermally excited co@xmath3 ions in the intermediate - spin state,@xcite but the observed distortion in lacoo@xmath2  is too small to be observed in a usual powder x - ray analysis .",

    "one source for spin - glass behavior are competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "such a competition may arise from local disorder which will be more pronounced in the sr- and ba - doped samples due to the larger a - site disorder than for ca doping .",
    "thus the absence of spin - glass behavior in la@xmath0ca@xmath1coo@xmath2  may arise from the similar ionic radii of la@xmath3 and ca@xmath4 .",
    "another reason could arise from the structural phase transition of la@xmath0ca@xmath1coo@xmath2 .",
    "this transition is located at room temperature for @xmath22 and possibly shifts towards lower temperatures for smaller @xmath5 . if one assumes that the ferromagnetic exchange is enhanced in the orthorhombic structure , a further reason for the ferromagnetic order in low - doped la@xmath0ca@xmath1coo@xmath2could be that these samples are orthorhombic at low temperatures .    as mentioned in the introduction",
    "it is not clear which spin states of the co@xmath3 and co@xmath133 ions are realized in la@xmath0m@xmath1coo@xmath2samples , and it is not known whether there are spin - state transitions as a function of temperature . from our present data",
    "we can not unambiguously resolve these puzzles .",
    "clear indications of spin - state transitions are only present in the @xmath48 curves of the la@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2  samples with very low doping ( @xmath134 ) . for larger dopings",
    "the @xmath48 curves are dominated by the occurrence of spin - glass or ferromagnetically ordered phases .",
    "the saturation values of the magnetization in the ferromagnetic phases with @xmath70 amount to @xmath135co for ca- and to @xmath136co for sr- and ba - doping .",
    "the latter value fits best to the expected spin - only value of @xmath137co expected for a co@xmath133 ls state ( @xmath138 ) and a co@xmath3 is state ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "if these spin states are realized one can easily imagine the relevance of the double exchange mechanism and understand the similarity to the manganites , because these spin states differ only by two additional down - spin electrons in the @xmath139 level from the corresponding high - spin states of mn@xmath133 ( @xmath140 ) and mn@xmath3 ( @xmath141 ) . in view of the much lower value of @xmath142 observed in the ca - doped sample this very simplified picture of considering spin - only values",
    "remains , however , questionable .",
    "we have presented a comparative study of the structure , magnetization and resistivity of charge - carrier doped la@xmath0m@xmath1coo@xmath2  with m = ca , sr , and ba ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "the sr- and ba - doped samples crystallize in a rhombohedral structure , which slowly ( moderately fast ) approaches cubic symmetry with increasing sr ( ba ) content . for la@xmath0ca@xmath1coo@xmath2",
    "there is a structural phase transition from rhombohedral to orthorhombic symmetry for @xmath66 .",
    "for all three series the resistivity rapidly decreases with increasing concentration of m. for ca doping the @xmath83 curves do not reach a metallic temperature dependence , whereas the sr - doped crystals become metallic for @xmath144 .",
    "the ba - doped samples are metallic above about 100  k for @xmath84 , but there are pronounced localization effects for low temperatures .",
    "the different resistivities may be explained by an increasing bandwidth with increasing ionic radii of the m@xmath4 ions on the one hand side and by local disorder due to the different ionic radii of la@xmath3 and m@xmath4 on the other .",
    "the @xmath48 curves indicate spin - glass behavior at low temperatures for the ba- and sr - doped samples with @xmath92 and @xmath145 , respectively , whereas for larger @xmath5 ferromagnetic order occurs .",
    "in contrast , the la@xmath0ca@xmath1coo@xmath2  samples show ferromagnetic order over the entire doping range .",
    "the reason for the absence of the spin glass region in la@xmath0ca@xmath1coo@xmath2  remains to be clarified .",
    "the ferromagnetic order occurs at the largest ordering temperatures @xmath146 for sr doping , for ba doping @xmath146 is slightly smaller and for ca doping significantly smaller .",
    "similar to the case of doped manganites  @xcite this non - monotonous dependence of @xmath67 on the ionic radii of m@xmath4 can be phenomenologically explained by assuming that the largest @xmath146 would be obtained in a perfectly cubic perovskite without disorder and is reduced by both , a deviation from cubic symmetry and local disorder due to different radii of la@xmath3 and m@xmath4 .",
    "la@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2  has higher @xmath67 values , since @xmath67 is strongly suppressed by a large deviation from cubic symmetry in la@xmath0ca@xmath1coo@xmath2  and by pronounced local disorder in la@xmath0ba@xmath1coo@xmath2 .",
    "we acknowledge fruitful discussions with m.braden , j.b.goodenough , m.grninger , d.khomskii , and l.h.tjeng .",
    "we thank g.dhalenne , p.reutler , and a.revcolevschi for their help when we were growing our first single crystals .",
    "this work was supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft through sfb  608 .",
    "we could also use the a - site ionic radii for 12-fold coordination as is done e.g. in ref .",
    "[ ] . this would cause quantiatively different parameters , but the main qualitative conclusions remain unchanged ."
