    "the boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( buu ) transport theory , based on binary collisions and on the propagation of particles in a selfconsistent mean field , is a very useful tool in understanding the heavy ion collisions ( hic ) in the energy region from the fermi energies ( @xmath5 a mev ) up to the relativistic energies ( @xmath6 a gev ) ( c.f",
    "@xcite for the description of the model in various numerical realizations and refs .",
    "@xcite for the results below 2 a gev ) .",
    "there are , however , systematic deviations from experimental data on pion and kaon production at @xmath7 a gev @xcite : the pion multiplicity is systematically overpredicted , while the slopes of the @xmath8 transverse mass spectra are too steep in the transport calculations .",
    "it has been advocated in @xcite , that the too soft kaon @xmath4-spectra are caused by missing the formation of a nonhadronic phase , which should create an additional pressure accelerating the kaons . on the other hand , the three - fluid hydrodynamical calculations @xcite have apparently been quite successfull in reproducing the @xmath4-spectra of hadrons at ags to sps energies by using a hadronic equation of state .",
    "this points to the idea of not enough thermalization produced by the microscopic transport models rather than to the importance of the nonhadronic degrees of freedom .    the many - body collisions",
    " usually missed in the current transport calculations at high energies  could serve as an additional source of the thermalization .",
    "the role of many - body collisions grows with baryon density , which reaches values of order of 1 - 2 @xmath9 at the energy region of 10 - 20 a gev @xcite .",
    "these are typical energies of the future compressed baryonic matter experiment at the facility for antiproton and ion research in darmstadt @xcite .    a simple estimate of the gas parameter @xcite at the baryon density @xmath10 , which is the maximum density reached in a central au+au collision at 20 a gev with @xmath11 @xmath9 being the normal nuclear matter density , is @xmath12 where @xmath13 mb is the asymptotic high - energy value of the total pp cross section in vacuum . in thermally equilibrated nuclear matter",
    ", one can neglect the lorentz contraction of the interaction volume @xmath14 ( c.f .",
    "eqs.([v12]),([v12_aver ] ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : freq ] below ) . since @xmath15 , one concludes , that the applicability condition of the binary collision approximation is violated ( c.f . ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as we have recently shown @xcite , at the maximum compression stage of the central au+au collision at 20 a gev , @xmath16-body collisions with @xmath17 should dominate .",
    "one way to describe this complex physical situation could be , indeed , an introduction of the new degrees of freedom , e.g. like the formation of a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "this is quite a challenging problem for the microscopic transport theories , which is , however , beyond the scope of our present study .",
    "another way is to simulate the many - body collisions within a theory containing only the hadronic degrees of freedom . at beam energies below 1 - 2 a gev , transport models taking into account @xmath16-body collisions ( with @xmath18 ) have been constructed by several authors ( c.f . refs .",
    "the difficulty , which appears at high baryon densities reached in the 10 a gev region is that the gas parameter is not small , and , therefore , such a theory can not be formulated with the vacuum cross sections as a decomposition of the collision integral in a series of powers of @xmath19 ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) . in other words ,",
    "the vacuum cross sections should be screened at high densities by particles surrounding the colliding pair @xcite .",
    "the screening effect appears also as a consequence of the dirac - brueckner calculations ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) , where the nuclear mean field and the in - medium reduced cross sections are derived from the same fundamental vacuum interaction . using in - medium reduced cross sections would reduce the relative contribution of the many - body collisions , since the gas parameter will be smaller .",
    "this would give a more solid ground to the kinetic theory , which is based on the small parameter @xmath19 .",
    "the fermi liquid theory @xcite gives a similar picture .",
    "there , the liquid of the real particles is equivalently replaced by the gas of quasiparticles .    in the present work ,",
    "we develop a transport model which contains a walecka - type baryonic mean field and the in - medium reduced baryon - baryon cross sections .",
    "the model is then extended by including three - body collisions . the mean field and the in - medium reduced cross sections lead to less thermalization , while the three - body collisions counterbalance this effect .",
    "we will show that the three - body collisions raise the inverse slope parameters of the hadron spectra in the central hic at beam energies of 2 - 40 a gev .",
    "in particular , the measured @xmath8 transverse mass spectra are well described by calculations with the three - body collisions .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "ii we briefly describe the gibuu model @xcite concentrating on its new ingredients : the relativistic mean field , the in - medium baryon - baryon cross sections and the three - body collisions . sect .",
    "iii contains numerical results . in sect .",
    "iv we summarize and discuss our results .",
    "our calculations are based on the gibuu model in a new version of ref .",

    "the model describes a nucleus - nucleus collision explicitly in time as a sequence of the baryon - baryon , meson - baryon and meson - meson collisions , baryon and meson resonance excitations and decays . between the two - body collisions",
    "the particles propagate in a selfconsistent mean field .",
    "the baryon - baryon collisions at @xmath20 gev are treated within the resonance model , while at @xmath21 gev the fritiof model is applied .",

    "@xcite instead of the default fritiof value of @xmath24 . in the meson - baryon collision case ,",
    "the fritiof mechanism of the double - string excitation and decay has been improved by adding the @xmath25 annihilation channel as described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the particles produced in string decays are not allowed to interact with their default cross sections up to some proper time interval , called formation time .",
    "we use a value of the formation time @xmath26 fm / c for all baryons and mesons .",
    "if one of the colliding particles is still in the formation interval , we call it a prehadron",
    ". the total cross section of the prehadron interaction with another particles is scaled according to the constituent quark model ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) : if the prehadron interacts with a hadron , the total cross section is multiplied by the factor of @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) for the pre - baryon ( pre - meson ) , where @xmath29 is the number of leading ( anti)quarks in the prehadron , i.e. the number of ( anti)quarks which were existing in the parent colliding particles for the given prehadron .",
    "if both colliding particles are prehadrons , the total cross section of their interaction is multiplied by the product of the two corresponding factors .",
    "the rescaling factor of the prehadron cross sections is quite important for the description of the produced particle multiplicities . in previous gibuu calculations of hic at 2 - 40 a gev @xcite ,",
    "this factor had been chosen to be 1/3 for the prehadrons containing at least one leading quark and zero otherwise .",
    "this explains the higher particle abundancies produced in the cascade mode in the present paper as compared to the results of ref .",
    "another distinction to the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite is that in the present work we miss the low energy ( @xmath20 gev ) baryon - baryon channel of kaon production @xmath30 .",
    "however , this channel was found to be negligible for the beam energies above 4 a gev @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we improve the previous gibuu calculations @xcite by implementing a relativistic mean field ( rmf ) , in - medium cross sections and three - body collisions in the model .",
    "the in - medium cross sections for the high energy baryon - baryon collisions computed according to the rmf model have already been introduced in @xcite .",
    "however , the rmf has not been used for the particle propagation in @xcite .",
    "below , we describe in - detail these new ingredients of our model .      in distinction to the earlier gibuu calculations @xcite , where the nonrelativistic momentum - dependent potential of ref .",
    "@xcite was used , in the present work we employ the relativistic treatment of the baryonic mean field . in spite of the lorentz invariant implementation of the potential from @xcite , when it is calculated in the local rest frame of nuclear matter ,",
    "the rmf is better suited for description of the high baryon densities reached in a central heavy ion collision at about 10 a gev beam energy . here , a consistent nuclear equation of state at high densities is of the primary importance .",
    "rmf models provide a quite good description of both the collective flow in hic and of the high density interior of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "they are also successfully applied in nuclear structure calculations @xcite .",
    "the one weakness of the rmf models , the too repulsive nucleon - nucleus interaction at high momenta ( c.f . @xcite and refs .",

    "@xcite . for the details of derivation",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite .    the geometrical method of refs .",
    "@xcite is based on the hard - sphere collision picture , i.e. the potential acting between colliding nucleons 1 and 2 is assumed to be infinitely repulsive at relative distances @xmath130 and zero at @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is equal to the sum of the matter radii of the colliding particles .",
    "the quantity @xmath132 can be expressed in terms of the total ( in - medium ) interaction cross section @xmath133 of the particles 1 and 2 as follows : @xmath134    the three - body collision is assumed to happen , if ( i ) the two nucleons 1 and 2 are about to collide according to the geometrical collision criterion @xcite and ( ii ) the third particle is found in a sphere of radius @xmath132 centered at the collision point of 1 and 2 .",
    "the geometrical collision criterion for selecting the colliding pair 1 and 2 means that these particles approach their minimum separation distance during the given time step , and this distance is less than @xmath132 .",
    "thus , the three - body collision takes place when all the three particles are found simultaneously in the interaction volume which is here the sphere of radius @xmath132 centered at the c.m .",
    "of 1 and 2 in coordinate space .",
    "the hard - sphere collision picture reflects , in a natural way , the short - range character of the nuclear forces acting between hadrons .",
    "however , in a high - energy nucleus - nucleus collision case , one must modify this picture to account for the lorentz contraction of the matter radii of the colliding hadrons .",
    "the relativistic gas of the lorentz - contracted hard spheres in thermal equilibrium has been already considered in refs .",
    "@xcite in order to derive the lorentz corrections to the excluded volume in the van - der - waalls equation of state .",
    "therefore , in the present work we define the interaction volume as an axially symmetric ellipsoid contracted along the collision axis of 1 and 2 by the average @xmath99-factor in their c.m .",
    "frame @xmath135 where @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "the ellipsoid has a half - axis of @xmath138 along the particle 1 momentum in the c.m .",
    "frame of 1 and 2 and a half - axis of @xmath132 in a transverse direction .",
    "we now select the set of all particles inside the ellipsoid which are different from 1 and 2 . in principle , all the particles from the set plus the colliding pair form a many - body colliding system .",
    "however , for technical reasons , we restricted ourselves in this work to a simulation of three - body collisions only .",
    "therefore , we choose only one particle from the set , namely , the closest particle to the c.m . of 1 and 2",
    " as a participant of a three - body collision . we will denote this particle as 3 below .",

    "it is assumed here that the particles 1,2 and 3 keep their identity . in particular , they stay on their initial dirac mass shells : @xmath147 , i=1,2,3 .    after the redistribution of the momenta , the two - body collision of the particles 1 and 2 with four - momenta @xmath148 and @xmath149 is simulated in a usual way .",

    "the meson - meson collisions are , however , relatively soft and can not influence much the high-@xmath150 part of the spectra , which are of the primary interest in our present study .    to save the cpu time , we have also switched - off the pauli blocking of the final state in all collision and resonance decay processes .",
    "we have checked by direct calculation , that above @xmath151 a gev the pauli blocking is negligibly small .",

    "it is necessary to point out , that when calculating the radius @xmath132 of eq.([rmax ] ) we have used the cross section @xmath133 somewhat different from the actual total two - body cross section implemented in the model .",
    "namely , in calculations with vacuum cross sections ( i),(ii ) and ( iii ) , @xmath133 was set to 40 mb for a baryon - baryon collision , which is an asymptotic high energy value of the total @xmath152 cross section . in the case of the calculation with in - medium baryon - baryon cross sections",

    "we observe , that the rmf reduces the maximum baryon and meson densities and also leads to a faster expansion of the compressed system .",
    "the three - body collisions do not influence the central densities and influence the total collision frequency only weakly .",
    "the weakness of the dependence of the total collision frequency on the three - body collisions is due to the fact , that the inclusion of the three - body collisions reduces the number of the pure two - body collisions , i.e. collisions where there is no other particles in the interaction volume of the primary colliding pair 1 and 2 . indeed only about 10 - 20% of all collision events are now pure two - body ( c.f .",
    "[ fig : freq ] below ) .",
    "it is interesting , that the inclusion of three - body collisions even reduces @xmath156 slightly .",
    "this happens , since the particle @xmath157 and the particles emerging from the interaction of @xmath158 and @xmath159 are final state particles of a three - body collision event ( see sect .",
    "the final state particles are not allowed to rescatter on each other before at least one of them will rescatter on another particle .",
    "this leads to an overall reduction of the total collision frequency , when the three - body collisions are included .",

    "the estimate ( [ estimate ] ) is depicted by the dashed lines in the bottom left and right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : freq ] .",
    "we observe , that eq.([estimate ] ) reproduces the overall behaviour of the directly computed ratio @xmath160 .",
    "in particular , one can see , that the flat maximum of @xmath160 calculated with the vacuum cross sections is caused by larger @xmath170 at the initial stage of collision . in the case of the in - medium baryon - baryon cross sections ,",
    "the value of @xmath170 drops quickly at the beginning , reaching the minimum at about 2 fm / c .",
    "this reduces the ratio @xmath160 at the initial stage of the collision and leads to the peak of the ratio at about 5 fm / c . at @xmath171 fm / c ,",
    "the meson - nucleon collisions dominate .",
    "thus , @xmath170 is close to 20 mb in both calculations , with vacuum and in - medium baryon - baryon cross sections . as a consequence , at @xmath171 fm / c the ratio @xmath160 , practically , does not depend on the baryon - baryon cross sections .",
    "another interesting feature is that the average @xmath99-factor ( c.f .",

    "[ fig : freq ] ) drops from initial value of @xmath172 to a rather low value of @xmath173 within 5 fm / c .",
    "this reflects the transition of the fast relative motion of colliding nuclei to a slower thermal motion of nearly equilibrated hadronic matter .",
    "the lorentz contraction of the interaction volume ( eqs . ( [ v12 ] ) and ( [ v12_aver ] ) ) plays only a moderate role for the equilibrated hadronic medium .",
    "however , at the initial nonequilibrium stage , the lorentz contraction suppresses the ratio @xmath160 very strongly .",
    "thus , as it should be , the very early stage of a relativistic heavy ion collision can be described by the binary cascade model quite well .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] shows the beam energy dependence of the maximum central baryon and total densities and of the maximum ratio @xmath160 reached in central au+au collisions .",
    "rmf reduces the maximum baryon and total densities quite substantially ( c.f . also fig .",

    "using the in - medium baryon - baryon cross sections leads to a dropping @xmath160 towards smaller beam energies .",
    "indeed , at smaller @xmath175 , the in - medium reduction of the baryon - baryon cross sections is better visible , due to the smaller number of the meson - baryon collisions .",

    "the in - medium reduced baryon - baryon cross sections reduce the stopping power due to less thermalization , while the three - body collisions act in the opposite direction leading to more thermalization .",
