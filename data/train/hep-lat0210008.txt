    "nucleon decay is one of the most important aspect that any ( susy ) gut model has . in low - energy effective theories",
    "it is represented by dimension six operators made of one lepton field and three quark fields . in the decay of @xmath0 , for example , we need to calculate hadronic matrix element of the three quark operator @xmath1 with initial proton and final pion states , where @xmath2 is the charge conjugation matrix .",
    "@xmath3 represents the right or left projection matrix , respectively .",
    "lattice calculation of the nucleon decay matrix elements historically started with the indirect calculation @xcite .",
    "first , one estimates the overlap of the operator to the proton state , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath6 with @xmath7 being the proton spinor .",
    "then , with the help of chiral perturbation theory , one can calculate the nucleon decay matrix elements .",
    "the first attempt to calculate the nucleon decay matrix element directly handling the three point function is done by gavela et .",
    "al @xcite , showing significant deviation from the indirect calculations .",

    "the relevant form factor @xmath10 is what we need since the term proportional to @xmath11 vanishes after multiplying the lepton spinor .",
    "@xmath12 is called the irrelevant form factor .",
    "jlqcd uses quenched wilson gauge configurations and wilson fermion at parameters summarized in table  [ tab : param ] ( c ) .",
    "the three quark operators are renormalized with one - loop perturbation theory .",
    "now the difference of direct and indirect calculations is not huge , but , still @xmath13 to @xmath14 for most cases .    in this study",
    "we try to calculate nucleon decay matrix elements with domain - wall fermions in the quenched approximation .",
    "using dbw2 gauge action makes chiral symmetry breaking especially small compared to the other actions @xcite . with this good chiral symmetry one",
    "expects the good property to calculate hadronic matrix elements : 1 ) preventing operator mixing with different chiral structure , and 2 ) good scaling , even down to @xmath15 gev region @xcite .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of degenerate quark mass in the meson . in this case",
    ", one can calculate @xmath16 and @xmath17 decay amplitudes .",
    "the latter is obtained by multiplying the former by @xmath18 under the exact su(2 ) symmetry of @xmath19 and @xmath20 quarks .",

    "our values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 in [ @xmath24 obtained by setting the scale with the @xmath25 mass input , are quite different from those with wilson fermion by jlqcd .",
    "the origin of the discrepancy could be , 1 ) discretization error , 2 ) systematic error of the mf perturbation , 3 ) difference of the renormalization scale .",
    "2 ) is about 30% for dwf , 3 ) is almost negligible .",
    "1 ) is expected to be most severe as it is seen in the difference of the scale from @xmath25 mass for wilson and dwf with wilson gauge background at same @xmath26 ( see ( c ) and ( d ) in table [ tab : param ] ) . indeed , if we set the scale from different quantity @xmath27 , which eliminates order @xmath28 error in the scale for wilson fermion , the values are consistent .",
    "we calculated proton decay matrix elements with dbw2 gauge action and dwf .",
    "we did not find a significant difference in values obtained by direct and indirect methods within our current numerical precision .",
    "further simulation with non - degenerate quark masses will reduce the error of direct calculation and make the extraction of nucleon to kaon decay amplitudes possible . within the current systematic error of the perturbation theory",
    "the chiral lagrangian parameters for the nucleon decay calculated with dwf are consistent with those obtained with wilson fermion by jlqcd if the scale is set by @xmath27 .",
    "more stringent comparison will be done for those values after non - perturbative renormalization is performed ."
