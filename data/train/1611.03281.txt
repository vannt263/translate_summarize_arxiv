    "the effect of inter - molecular interactions between geometrically identical heisenberg spin clusters has been also investigated in a variety of geometric spin arrangements including the coupled spin triangles @xcite , squares and cubes @xcite , rings , icosahedrons @xcite or dodecahedrons @xcite .    the heisenberg spin clusters with a geometric shape of regular convex polyhedra ( tetrahedron , octahedron , cube , icosahedron and dodecahedron ) have the most beautiful magnetic architecture from the symmetry point of view .",

    "moreover , one may expect extraordinary rich magnetic behaviour of the regular heisenberg polyhedra due to a mutual interplay of the geometric spin frustration and quantum effects , because only the spin cube is non - frustrated on assumption that the antiferromagnetic nearest - neighbour interaction is considered .",
    "owing to this fact , the magnetization curves and magnetocaloric properties of the regular heisenberg polyhedra have been comprehensively studied @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been demonstrated that the regular ising polyhedra also exhibit due to the geometric spin frustration several intriguing magnetic features such as presence of multiple intermediate magnetization plateaux and jumps in spite of the complete lack of quantum fluctuations @xcite .",

    "moreover , one may expect that the exchange anisotropy can be relevant for many magnetic molecules , but to the best of our knowledge , the effect of the exchange anisotropy has not been dealt with yet . in the present work , we will therefore fill in this gap by exploring the magnetization process and magnetocaloric properties of the spin-1/2 xxz heisenberg clusters with the shape of regular polyhedra .",

    "it is quite apparent that the underlying mechanism for a formation of the novel magnetization plateaux must be of a purely quantum origin in contrast with the formation mechanism of remaining intermediate plateaux , which emerge in the semi - classical ising limit on account of a geometric spin frustration . while the most of novel quantized magnetization plateaux appear by assuming arbitrary but non - zero @xmath0-part of the xxz exchange interaction ( @xmath69 ) , this need not be always the case as evidenced by two particular examples of the one - fourth plateau of the spin-1/2 xxz heisenberg cube or the one - tenth plateau of the spin-1/2 xxz heisenberg dodecahedron .    the spin-1/2 xxz heisenberg regular polyhedra display a remarkable diversity of the low - temperature magnetization curves closely connected to the magnetization steps or jumps , which take place at each field - driven crossing of the lowest - energy levels corresponding to adjacent magnetization plateaux .",
