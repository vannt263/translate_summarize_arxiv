    "consider the stochastic process @xmath13 defined by the langevin equation @xmath14 where @xmath2 is a positive parameter , and @xmath15 is a gaussian white noise such that @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in the new time scale",
    "@xmath18 this process satisfies the usual langevin equation for one - dimensional brownian motion , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is still a gaussian white noise , with @xmath21 and @xmath22 . the process defined by ( [ process ] ) is a simple example of subordinated brownian motion @xcite . as brownian motion itself , it is gaussian , markovian , and non - stationary .",
    "this process appears in various situations of physical interest .",
    "for instance , it is described in @xcite as a markovian approximation to fractional brownian motion .",
    "it also appears in ref .",
    "@xcite for the special case @xmath23 , as describing the time evolution of the total magnetization of a glauber chain undergoing phase ordering .",
    "dhar and majumdar @xcite raised the question of computing the distribution of the occupation time of this process , that is the length of time spent by the process on one side of the origin up to time @xmath4 , @xmath24 where @xmath25 , or equivalently of @xmath26 where @xmath6 , the temporal mean of @xmath27 , is hereafter referred to as the ` mean magnetization ' by analogy with physical situations where @xmath27 represents a spin .",
    "the distribution of the occupation time bears information on the statistics of persistent events of the process beyond that contained in the persistence exponent @xcite .",
    "this exponent governs the decay @xmath28 of the survival probability of the process , that is the probability that the process did not cross the origin up to time @xmath4 .",
    "actually , for the present case , the determination of @xmath29 is trite , as shown by a simple reasoning @xcite : the probability for the brownian process @xmath30 not to change sign up to time @xmath31 is known to decay as @xmath32 , hence for the original process as @xmath33 .",
    "this shows that @xmath34 .    when @xmath35 , the distribution of the fraction of time spent on one side of the origin by a random walker , or by brownian motion , is given , in the long - time regime , by the arcsine law @xcite .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath36 , the explicit determination of this distribution , or equivalently of the distribution of @xmath6 , seems very difficult . however , as shown in @xcite , in the long - time regime , the computation of the asymptotic moments @xmath37 can be done recursively , using two different methods , yielding the same results .",
    "the first method relies on a formalism due to kac @xcite , while the second one originates from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the method used in ref .",
    "@xcite can be applied to any ( smooth ) process for which the intervals of time between sign changes are independent , when taken on a logarithmic scale , with finite ( i.e. , non zero ) mean @xmath38 .",
    "it eventually leads to a recursive determination of the moments of @xmath39 , as @xmath40 ( see equation ( [ rec_mk ] ) below ) .",
    "dhar and majumdar make the observation that , since relations  ( [ rec_mk ] ) are independent of @xmath38 , they can be applied to the determination of the moments of @xmath39 for the process ( [ process ] ) . comparing the resulting expressions of the moments",
    "thus obtained to those derived by their alternative method shows that this is indeed the case .",
    "however it is not obvious to understand why relations  ( [ rec_mk ] ) hold for the ( non - smooth ) process ( [ process ] ) , since the assumptions made in order to derive them do not hold for such a process . in particular while , for the class of models with independent time intervals on a logarithmic scale , and finite @xmath38 ( for which the method of ref .  @xcite has been devised )",
    ", it is natural to work in a logarithmic scale of time , since the mean number of sign changes between @xmath41 and @xmath4 scales as @xmath42 , this is not so in the present case , since @xmath38 asymptotically vanishes , and the mean number of sign changes scales as @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the validity of relations  ( [ rec_mk ] ) for the process ( [ process ] ) therefore requires an explanation .    in the present work ,",
    "we revisit and extend the study done in @xcite .",
    "we first give a new derivation of the asymptotic expressions of the moments @xmath37 .",
    "we start from the same premises as in ref .",
    "@xcite , then follow another route more adapted to the process under study because of the difficulties encountered in applying step by step the method of ref .",
    "@xcite to the present case ( sections 2 - 5 ) .",
    "we then identify the symmetry properties of the distributions of the random variables that appear in the computations , and derive a functional integral equation , the solution of which yields the distribution of @xmath6 ( section 6 ) .",
    "this approach is first checked on the case @xmath44 ( section 7 ) .",
    "it is then successively applied to the study of the local behavior of this distribution in the persistence region , for general  @xmath8 ( section  8) , and to the large-@xmath8 regime ( section 9 ) .",
    "we finally discuss some aspects of ref .",
    "we explain why a formal application of the method of ref .",
    "@xcite to the present case is only heuristic , and give a new interpretation of the results obtained in @xcite with the method of kac , under the light of the present work ( section 10 ) .",
    "changes of sign of the process @xmath1 ( or zero crossings ) occur at discrete instants of time @xmath45 , once the process is suitably regularized at short times .",
    "we assume that the process starts at the origin , so that @xmath46 is also a sign change .",
    "let @xmath47 be the number of sign changes which occurred between @xmath41 and @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath47 is the random variable for the largest @xmath48 for which @xmath49    in the scale @xmath31 , where the process is ( regularized ) brownian motion , sign changes occur at the instants of time @xmath50 , and @xmath51 is the random variable for the largest @xmath48 for which @xmath52 .",
    "the intervals of time between sign changes are denoted by @xmath53 .",
    "these are independent , identically distributed random variables , with a probability density function @xmath54 . for large values of @xmath55",
    ", @xmath54 decays proportionally to @xmath56 .",
    "this behavior is independent of the regularizing procedure , while its prefactor just reflects the choice of time units .",
    "the density @xmath54 is therefore in the basin of attraction of a lvy law of index @xmath57 .",
    "we choose units so that we have in laplace space @xmath58 the process formed by the independent intervals of time @xmath59 , is known as a renewal process . in the original scale @xmath4 ,",
    "the intervals of time @xmath60 are _ not _ independent .",
    "we denote by @xmath61 the instant of the last change of sign of the process before time  @xmath4 .",
    "this random variable depends implicitly on time @xmath4 through @xmath47 . in the scale @xmath31",
    ", we have @xmath62 .    the occupation times @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( see equation  ( [ occup ] ) ) are the lengths of time spent by the sign process @xmath65 respectively in the @xmath66 and @xmath67 states , up to time @xmath4 , hence @xmath68 .",
    "they are simply related to the mean magnetization ( [ magnet ] ) by @xmath69 assume that @xmath70 at @xmath71 , i.e. , @xmath72",
    ". then @xmath73 the converse holds if @xmath74 .",
    "hence we have , with equal probabilities , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the fraction of time spent in the state @xmath66 if @xmath77 , and conversely .",
    "the last formula can be rewritten as @xmath78 where the @xmath79 obey the recursion @xmath80 with @xmath81 . both random variables @xmath79 and @xmath82 depend implicitly on time @xmath4 through @xmath47 .    for instance ,",
    "if @xmath72 and @xmath83 , then @xmath84 where @xmath85 , with @xmath86",
    "equations ( [ eqm ] ) , ( [ eqxi ] ) and ( [ kesten ] ) contain in essence the solution to the problem posed , namely the determination of the limiting distribution of the mean magnetization @xmath6 for @xmath87 .",
    "unfortunately , no explicit solution can be attained in general .",
    "however , from ( [ eqm])-([kesten ] ) , one can obtain recursively the moments of @xmath6 , in the long - time limit .",
    "this can be done either along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite , as done in @xcite , or by the method of the present work . in this section",
    ", we explain the difficulty encountered when applying the method of ref .",
    "@xcite to the process ( [ process ] ) , in order to justify the more lengthy path we have adopted for the derivation of the moments .",
    "we shall come back to the comparison between the two methods in section 10 .",
    "assume that , in the long - time regime , the dimensionless random variables @xmath88 , @xmath82 , @xmath79 , @xmath89 , and @xmath6 possess a limiting joint distribution .",
    "define @xmath90 then the equations to be solved are : @xmath91 these equalities hold in distribution , and the random variables entering them are not independent a priori . equation ( [ kestenbis ] ) is to be understood as the fixed - point equation corresponding to the recursion ( [ kesten ] ) , while ( [ eqxibis ] ) and ( [ eqmbis ] ) respectively correspond to ( [ eqxi ] ) and ( [ eqm ] ) .",
    "assume that the distribution of the random variable @xmath92 is given , and that @xmath92 is independent of @xmath93 .",
    "even so , solving ( [ kestenbis ] ) is difficult in general @xcite .",
    "however , obtaining the moments of @xmath93 recursively is easier .",
    "if furthermore @xmath94 and @xmath93 are independent and the moments of @xmath94 are known , then ( [ eqxibis ] ) and ( [ eqmbis ] ) determine the moments of @xmath95 .",
    "such a situation precisely arises in the example treated in @xcite : the process @xmath1 is the diffusing field at a fixed point of space , evolving from random initial conditions , and the so - called independent - interval approximation is used @xcite . in the long - time regime ,",
    "the process is stationary in the logarithmic scale of time @xmath96 . as a consequence ,",
    "the autocorrelation function of the sign process , @xmath97 , only depends on the difference of logarithmic times @xcite .",
    "consider the intervals of time @xmath98 between successive sign changes of the process in the logarithmic scale of time , @xmath99 , or @xmath100 the independent - interval approximation consists in considering the intervals @xmath98 as independent , thus defining a renewal process .",
    "the distribution of the random variable @xmath98 can then be derived , in laplace space , from the knowledge of the correlation function @xmath101 .",
    "this distribution is found to be independent of time , because the process is stationary in logarithmic time .",
    "its average , @xmath102 , is some time - independent positive number .",
    "explicitly , @xmath103 with @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the laplace transform of @xmath106 .",
    "in particular , the moments @xmath107 are independent of time .",
    "thus from ( [ kestenbis ] ) the moments of @xmath93 are determined recursively in terms of the @xmath108 ( see ( [ rec_xk ] ) ) .    in the long - time regime ,",
    "the distribution of the backward recurrence time of the process in the logarithmic scale , @xmath109 , is also independent of time .",
    "this logarithmic recurrence time is related to the random variable @xmath94 by @xmath110 its distribution in laplace space reads @xmath111    the random variables @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( or @xmath112 ) are independent . hence ( [ eqxibis ] ) and ( [ eqmbis ] ) determine the moments of @xmath95 .",
    "a remarkable fact is that the moments thus obtained , which are functions of the @xmath108 and of @xmath38 , become independent of @xmath38 when the  @xmath108 are expressed in terms of the @xmath113 , using equations ( [ fls ] ) , ( [ gs ] ) and ( [ def_fk ] ) .",
    "thus  @xcite @xmath114 and so on .",
    "more generally , the method used in @xcite can be applied to any process for which the intervals of time between sign changes are independent , when taken on a logarithmic scale .",
    "it eventually leads to a recursive determination of the moments of @xmath95 , resulting in  ( [ rec_mk ] ) .",
    "the situation for the process ( [ process ] ) is more difficult because , in the limit @xmath115 , @xmath116 .",
    "hence ( [ kestenbis ] ) no longer determines @xmath93 , and furthermore @xmath117 .",
    "now , for the class of models with independent time intervals @xmath98 on a logarithmic scale , and finite ( i.e. , non - zero ) @xmath118 , for which the method of ref .",
    "@xcite , sketched above , has been devised , the mean number of sign changes between @xmath41 and @xmath4 scales as @xmath42 .",
    "so , in contrast , in the present case there is no obvious reason to work with this logarithmic scale of time , since @xmath119 asymptotically vanishes , and the mean number of sign changes scales as @xmath43 @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "if time is kept finite , then the time intervals @xmath98 are not independent and the process ( [ process ] ) is not stationary , precluding again the application of the method of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a way out is to formally apply this method to the process ( [ process ] ) , without paying attention to the difficulties mentioned above , and taking advantage of the fact that the moments @xmath120 , given by ( [ rec_mk ] ) , are independent on @xmath38 , and therefore ( hopefully ) insensitive to the fact that @xmath121 .",
    "this approach , which is the one followed by dhar and majumdar @xcite , is however only heuristic , as further discussed in section [ revisit ] .",
    "our approach relies instead on the fact that the time intervals @xmath122 between two sign changes of the process ( [ process ] ) form a renewal process ( the @xmath122 are independent , identically distributed random variables with density @xmath54 , given by ( [ pdf_ro ] ) for large @xmath55 ) .",
    "this is a fundamental property of the process ( [ process ] ) , and in particular of brownian motion if @xmath35 .",
    "this property allows us to determine the limiting distribution @xmath123 of @xmath94 when @xmath87 , and the moments @xmath124 of the random variable @xmath82 , which are now time dependent .",
    "we also find the explicit time - dependent expression of @xmath125 .",
    "using the original equation ( [ kesten ] ) , instead of ( [ kestenbis ] ) , and equations ( [ eqxibis ] ) and ( [ eqmbis ] ) , we eventually recover the expressions  ( [ rec_mk ] ) of the @xmath120 , thus extending their range of applicability .",
    "we then establish an integral equation for @xmath126 , and study its consequences .",
    "using the independence of the @xmath59 , we first determine the distribution of the random variable @xmath127 from which we then deduce that of @xmath61 . the method used below",
    "is borrowed from ref .",
    "@xcite , where a thorough study of the statistics of the occupation time of renewal processes can be found .",
    "we denote by @xmath128 the joint probability density of the random variables @xmath129 and  @xmath47 .",
    "it reads @xmath130 where @xmath131 if the event inside the parenthesis occurs , and @xmath41 if not .",
    "the brackets denote the average over @xmath132 summing over @xmath48 gives the distribution of @xmath129 , @xmath133    in laplace space , where @xmath134 is conjugate to @xmath31 and @xmath135 to @xmath136 , @xmath137 note that setting @xmath138 in ( [ ftn ] ) gives the distribution of @xmath139 .",
    "we finally obtain @xmath140 in the long - time regime , i.e. , for @xmath134 and @xmath135 simultaneously small , we get the scaling form @xmath141 which yields @xmath142 as a consequence , the random variable @xmath143 possesses the limiting distribution @xmath144 which is the arcsine law on @xmath145 $ ] .    using the equality @xmath88 @xmath146 ,",
    "this last result yields immediately the distribution of @xmath147 which reads @xmath148 this is the main result of this section .",

    "in order to obtain recursion relations for the moments of the random variable @xmath93 , we proceed in two steps .",
    "we first compute the moments of @xmath154 , from which we deduce those of @xmath82 .",
    "the recursion relations for the @xmath155 then emerge from ( [ kesten ] ) .",
    "equations ( [ eqxibis ] ) and ( [ eqmbis ] ) finally determine the moments of @xmath95 .",
    "we first determine the probability density function of the joint variables @xmath156 and @xmath129 . in laplace space , we have @xmath157 summing over @xmath48 gives @xmath158 so that in particular @xmath159 .    the first moment of the random variable @xmath154 is obtained by considering @xmath160 which leads to @xmath161 omitting the finite parts of the logarithms",

    "we have @xmath162 which leads to @xmath163 where @xmath164 is given by equation ( [ mom_arcsin ] ) .",
    "in particular , since @xmath165 , ( [ first ] ) is recovered .",
    "the result  ( [ jmom ] ) can be extended to non - integer values of @xmath166 .",
    "we have thus ( see  ( [ defln ] ) ) @xmath167 as @xmath168 .",
    "equation  ( [ jmom ] ) can thus be rewritten as @xmath169 as announced above , when @xmath87 , the random variable @xmath154 converges to 1 , in distribution .",
    "the moments @xmath124 of @xmath82 are obtained from ( [ hk ] ) as @xmath170 because @xmath171 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath172 hence finally @xmath173      from the recursion relation ( [ kesten ] ) , we have @xmath174 in the long - time regime , there is an asymptotic decoupling of the variables @xmath175 and @xmath82 , so that it is legitimate to take @xmath176 , while keeping the leading time dependence of @xmath124 , given by ( [ fkt ] ) .",
    "this procedure can be justified along the lines of ref .",
    "consider first the simple situation @xmath177 .",
    "the difference between unity and @xmath178 , which gives rise to the result ( [ fkt ] ) , is proportional to the interval @xmath179 .",
    "this quantity has been shown in @xcite to be , asymptotically for large  @xmath4 , independent of @xmath180 , and distributed according to the a priori law @xmath181 .",
    "a similar decoupling asymptotically takes place for generic @xmath8 .    denoting the moments @xmath155 by @xmath182",
    ", we obtain @xmath183 with @xmath184 , and where we have introduced the notation @xmath185 for the linear binomial operator @xmath186    as shown in the appendix , ( [ binom ] ) implies the following recursion relations , according to the parity of @xmath166 , @xmath187 using the expression ( [ fkt ] ) of @xmath124 , we obtain , in the limit @xmath87 , where @xmath188 , @xmath189 these relations , which can be rewritten as @xmath190 determine the stationary values of the @xmath182 recursively .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath191      for reasons similar to those exposed below equation  ( [ jdecou ] ) , the random variables @xmath94 and @xmath93 ( defined in the limit @xmath40 ) are independent .",
    "thus , by ( [ eqxibis ] ) we have @xmath192 which , together with equation  ( [ kestenbis ] ) , leads to a determination of the even moments of the mean magnetization @xmath95 in terms of the @xmath193 : @xmath194 we thus finally obtain @xmath195 and so on .    for instance ,",
    "if @xmath35 , corresponding to brownian motion , the successive even moments of @xmath95 are equal to @xmath57 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 , i.e. , @xmath199 which are the even moments of the arcsine law on @xmath200 $ ] ( see ( [ fm ] ) below ) .",
    "the recursion relation ( [ recur1 ] ) expresses a symmetry property of the distribution @xmath126 : @xmath202 ( see appendix ) .",
    "this is also obvious from ( [ kestenbis ] ) , since formally @xmath203 in the present case .",

    "this situation corresponds to brownian motion .",
    "it is easy to check that the uniform distribution on @xmath145 $ ] , @xmath218 solves the problem .",
    "indeed , equations  ( [ convol ] ) and  ( [ jconvol ] ) yield @xmath219 which satisfy ( [ fxi_sym ] ) and ( [ jphisym ] ) . finally , by ( [ def_fm ] ) , the limiting distribution of @xmath6 is obtained : @xmath220 which is the arcsine law on @xmath200 $ ] .",

    "the estimate ( [ jxpers ] ) also agrees with ( [ juni ] ) .    for @xmath247 ,",
    "the distribution @xmath243 is no longer a beta law , so that the enhancement factor @xmath248 is non - trivial .",
    "for large values of @xmath8 , the distributions @xmath214 , @xmath249 , and @xmath250 are expected to share , at least qualitatively , some resemblance with the beta law  ( [ jbet ] ) .",
    "this observation suggests to set @xmath251 with @xmath252 as a consequence of ( [ fx_sym ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath253 is expected to be regular , and positive , with a minimum at @xmath254 , just as its counterpart @xmath255 associated with the beta law ( [ jbet ] ) .    with these hypotheses , @xmath215 , given by ( [ jconvol ] ) ,",
    "can be estimated as follows . setting @xmath256 with @xmath257",

    "the function @xmath267 is entirely determined by the above conditions .",

    "let us first investigate the behavior of @xmath267 for @xmath270 , i.e. , @xmath271 , corresponding to the center of the distributions . inserting the expansion @xmath272 in ( [ jpex ] ) , ( [ jpsym ] ) , and expanding the gamma functions accordingly , we obtain @xmath273 and @xmath274    to leading order , keeping only the quadratic term in @xmath267 , we find that the bulk of the distributions is asymptotically given by narrow gaussians for @xmath8 large , namely @xmath275 the latter result is in agreement with the expressions ( [ rec_mkbis ] ) of the moments of @xmath95 , which behave as @xmath276 , @xmath277 , and so on , for @xmath278 .",
    "it is also worthwhile noticing that the beta law ( [ jbet ] ) , ( [ jfb ] ) also becomes a narrow gaussian for @xmath8 large .",
    "we have @xmath279 and @xmath280 , so that the beta law misses a finite factor @xmath281 in the variance of the mean magnetization .",
    "the expression ( [ jc ] ) of the subleading amplitude @xmath282 , involving riemann s zeta function , shows however that the function @xmath267 is altogether non - trivial .",
    "let us now turn to the behavior of @xmath267 deep in the tails of the distributions , i.e. , for @xmath230 or 1 , or @xmath283 , corresponding to the persistence region .",
    "the general result ( [ fmpers ] ) shows that @xmath284 has a logarithmic divergence as @xmath230 . as a consequence ,",
    "the gamma function in the numerator of expression ( [ jpex ] ) for @xmath268 becomes singular , as its argument goes to zero .",
    "furthermore , in the same expression for @xmath285 , the arguments of both gamma functions tend to infinity",
    ". a careful treatment of ( [ jpex ] ) yields the more complete expansions as @xmath230 @xmath286 while the constant @xmath287 can not be predicted by this local analysis .",
    "the square - root behavior of @xmath268 and its prefactor agree with the general results ( [ jfpers ] ) , ( [ jxpers ] ) .",
    "we have numerically determined the solution of ( [ jpex ] ) , ( [ jpsym ] ) over the whole range @xmath288 , obtaining thus accurate values of @xmath267 .",
    "this approach yields in particular @xmath289 .",
    "figure  1 shows a plot of the function @xmath267 thus obtained , compared with @xmath290 .",
    "as the amplitude @xmath291 of the beta law ( [ jbet ] ) remains of order unity , within exponential accuracy , the result ( [ jff ] ) for @xmath267 implies that the amplitude @xmath292 of the power law ( [ fmpers ] ) in the persistence region , and the enhancement factor @xmath248 defined in ( [ je ] ) , blow up exponentially , as @xmath293 with @xmath294    in order to test the relevance of this large-@xmath8 approach , we have evaluated numerically @xmath248 for various values of the parameter @xmath8 , and compared the results with the exponential law ( [ jg ] ) predicted for large @xmath8 .",
    "the computation of @xmath248 can be done in ( at least ) two different ways .",
    "the first method consists in directly evaluating the limit @xmath295 the moments of the beta law ( [ jbet ] ) read @xmath296 while the true moments @xmath297 are determined from ( [ recur1bis ] ) , ( [ recur2bis ] ) , and ( [ jme ] ) , up to some maximal order , typically @xmath298 to 150 , beyond which numerical accuracy rapidly deteriorates , because the computation of @xmath297 involves alternating sums .",
    "the second method consists in combining ( [ jcex ] ) and ( [ jcb ] ) , getting thus @xmath299 and in evaluating @xmath300 as @xmath301 the behavior ( [ jxpers ] ) implies that the @xmath302 decay as @xmath303 , so that the term of order @xmath48 in the above sum decays as @xmath304 .",
    "hence this sum is convergent , and truncating it at some order @xmath305 brings a correction proportional to @xmath306 .",
    "the @xmath302 are again determined from ( [ recur1bis ] ) and ( [ recur2bis ] ) .",
    "a linear extrapolation in @xmath306 of the results of both schemes turns out to yield consistent results .",
    "we have for instance @xmath307 for @xmath308 .",
    "figure  2 shows our numerical results for the enhancement factor @xmath248 , for values of @xmath8 up to 3 .",
    "the comparison with the exponential law ( [ jg ] ) is convincing , in spite of the moderate values of @xmath8 used .",
    "let us first show that the expressions ( [ rec_mkbis ] ) for the even moments of @xmath95 are the same as those obtained by using ( [ rec_mk ] ) , with the expression of @xmath105 appropriate to the process ( [ process ] ) , as done in @xcite .",
    "the autocorrelation @xmath309 of the sign process @xmath65 in the logarithmic scale of time @xmath96 reads @xmath310 @xcite , with laplace transform @xmath311 . \\label{ahat}\\ ] ] we notice that @xmath105 is related to @xmath312 , defined in ( [ hsa ] ) , by @xmath313 where the right side is equal to @xmath314 by ( [ gs ] ) . using this identity , it is easy to check that the moments ( [ rec_mk ] ) obtained by the method of section [ reminder ] , with @xmath315 given by  ( [ ahat ] ) for @xmath316 integer , are identical to the moments ( [ rec_mkbis ] ) obtained by the method of the present work .",
    "it is , however , not possible to identify the intermediate results of both methods , as can be seen by comparing respectively equation ( [ fkt ] ) to equations ( [ def_fk ] ) and ( [ fls ] ) , and equation ( [ hsa ] ) to equation ( [ flambdas ] ) .",
    "this demonstrates the formal character of the application of the method of section [ reminder ] to the process ( [ process ] ) .",
    "( see also the discussion in section 3.3 . )",
    "a first comment is that the recursion relations for the coefficients @xmath317 appearing in equations ( 14 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite can be easily recognized to be identical to the recursion relations ( [ recur1bis ] ) , ( [ recur2bis ] ) for the @xmath182 , by noting the correspondences @xmath318    the second comment concerns the continuity conditions expressed in equations ( 13 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite . using ( [ identif ] )",
    ", these conditions yield , with the notations of the present work , @xmath319 these equations hold for @xmath320 arbitrary , hence they are equivalent to ( [ fx_sym ] ) and ( [ fxi_sym ] ) , respectively .",
    "in this paper we have revisited and extended the work of dhar and majumdar @xcite .",
    "besides providing a new recursive determination of the moments of the mean magnetization @xmath95 , the present study leads to a functional integral equation for the distribution of the latter quantity .",
    "this framework allows a local analysis of this distribution , and of other relevant quantities , in the persistence region @xmath7 , as well as a detailed investigation of the regime where @xmath8 is large .",
    "the present work casts new light on the status of the expressions ( [ rec_mk ] ) for the moments of @xmath95 .",
    "the method recalled in section  [ reminder ] , which leads to these relations , can be applied to any smooth process for which the intervals of time @xmath321 between sign changes are independent , on a logarithmic scale . for this class of processes",
    "@xmath322 is finite ( i.e. , non - zero ) , and the mean number of sign changes between @xmath41 and @xmath4 scales as @xmath42 .    relations ( [ rec_mk ] ) are also verified for the class of processes considered in this work .",
    "this was observed in @xcite ( by comparing the expressions thus found to those obtained by another method , based on a formalism due to kac ) , and justified by the absence of @xmath323 in equations ( [ rec_mk ] ) . yet , as discussed in section 3.3 , in the present case there is no obvious reason to work with a logarithmic scale of time , since @xmath324 asymptotically vanishes , and the mean number of sign changes scales as @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "( see also the discussion in section 10.1 . )",
    "most of the effort of the present work was to provide a new derivation of ( [ rec_mk ] ) for the class of processes ( [ process ] ) .",
    "our approach relies on the fact that the time intervals @xmath122 between two sign changes of the process ( [ process ] ) form a renewal process ( the @xmath122 are independent , identically distributed random variables ) .",
    "the derivation proceeds in two steps .",
    "first , relations ( [ rec_mkbis ] ) for the @xmath325 are obtained ; then , using ( [ relation ] ) , equations ( [ rec_mkbis ] ) yield ( [ rec_mk ] ) .",
    "this extends the range of applicability of relations ( [ rec_mk ] ) .",
    "note that for diffusion ( in the independent - interval approximation ) ( see section 3.2 ) , relations ( [ rec_mk ] ) hold but neither ( [ rec_mkbis ] ) nor ( [ relation ] ) do .",
    "we conclude by a few additional comments .    in passing ,",
    "let us mention another equivalent formulation of ( [ relation ] ) , namely that the two - time autocorrelation of the sign process reads , with @xmath326 , @xmath327    another situation where ( [ rec_mk ] ) , ( [ rec_mkbis ] ) , and ( [ relation ] ) or ( [ ch ] ) hold is for the renewal processes considered in @xcite ( provided @xmath328 ) , which are yet another deformation of brownian motion .",
    "note that the first relation of ( [ rec_mk ] ) , @xmath329 , holds whenever the two - time autocorrelation function is a scaling function of the ratio of the two times @xcite , while the first relation of ( [ rec_mkbis ] ) , @xmath330 , does not in general .",
    "for instance , for the random acceleration problem , using results of ref .",
    "@xcite , we find @xmath331 and @xmath332 .",
    "this work also underlines the importance of the random variables @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the distribution of the latter is known exactly in the present case .",
    "this quantity , which is a natural one to consider for brownian motion  @xcite , and more generally for renewal processes @xcite , appears also in the context of phase ordering  @xcite .    as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the process ( [ process ] ) has been proposed @xcite as a markovian approximation to fractional brownian motion .",
    "let us compare the expressions of @xmath333 for these two processes .",
    "for the present model we have ( see  ( [ rec_mkbis ] ) ) @xmath334 while for fractional brownian motion , with hlder index @xmath335 , we have @xmath336 the correspondence between the two processes is made by identifying their persistence exponents : @xmath337 .",
    "for @xmath338 , we have @xmath339 in both cases . for @xmath340 , ( [ 1j ] ) yields @xmath341 , while ( [ 2j ] ) yields @xmath342 . for @xmath343",
    ", we have @xmath344 , with ( [ 1j ] ) yielding @xmath345 , and ( [ 2j ] ) yielding @xmath346 .",
    "the distributions of the mean magnetization for the two processes are therefore expected to be rather similar ( for @xmath347 ) .",
    "finally , let us comment on the changes in behaviour induced by letting the persistence exponent @xmath8 vary , and compare the present process to other ones in this respect .",
    "the distribution of @xmath95 shows a change in shape as @xmath8 increases , the most probable value of the mean magnetization shifting from the edges to the center @xcite .",
    "more precisely , as shown in section 8 , as long as @xmath348 , @xmath250 diverges at @xmath283 , while for @xmath349 it vanishes at these points ( see equation  ( [ fmpers ] ) ) .",
    "however for any arbitrary value of @xmath8 the magnetization @xmath95 remains distributed .",
    "this behaviour is actually generic , whenever the two - time autocorrelation function of the process is asymptotically a function of the ratio of the two time variables @xcite . in particular",
    ", this is so for diffusion . in the independent - interval approximation",
    "the persistence exponent @xmath350 increases without bounds when the dimension of space @xmath351 is large @xcite .",
    "as originally noted in @xcite , as long as @xmath352 the density @xmath250 diverges at the edges , while it vanishes there if @xmath353 .",
    "this was also emphasized in @xcite , on the basis of scaling arguments , and recently confirmed by direct numerical computations @xcite .",
    "in contrast , there are other processes for which the change in behaviour at @xmath340 is more radical . for fractional brownian motion , @xmath340 appears as a maximum persistence exponent .",
    "for the renewal processes considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , the mean magnetization possesses a non - trivial asymptotic distribution only if @xmath352 .",
    "the aim of this appendix is to prove the following property , used in section 5.2 .",
    "assume that the sequence @xmath182 satisfies @xmath354 with @xmath355 , and where @xmath356 ( see ( [ jb ] ) ) .",
