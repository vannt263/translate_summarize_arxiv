    "figures [ fig : 1.1 ] and [ fig : 1.2 ] illustrate two different fractal point sets in two dimensions ( their origins will be described shortly ) .",
    "the fractal dimensions ( as defined in @xcite ) of these sets are very similar ( the correlation dimension are @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively ) , but inspection of these figures suggests that the fine - scale structure of these sets is quite different . in this paper we consider whether it is possible to make a distinction between the local structures of fractals by using covering sets which become increasingly anisotropic as the covers are made smaller . we show that this can distinguish different sets which have the same fractal dimension .",
    "moreover , we shall argue that the use of anisotropic covers can be important in analysing the scattering of radiation from fractal distributions of matter .",
    "the sets illustrated in figures [ fig : 1.1 ] and [ fig : 1.2 ] are point set fractals which arise as models for the distribution of particles resulting from two distinct physical processes . figure [ fig : 1.1 ] illustrates a model of particles in a turbulent flow , in circumstances where inertial effects are large enough to ensure that the particles are not simply advected .",
    "it is known that such systems may exhibit clustering @xcite and that the attractor is a fractal measure @xcite .",
    "an enlargement of a subset of figure [ fig : 1.1 ] shows that the particle distribution is _ locally _ highly anisotropic , with the particles tending to be clustered close to lines in the plane , even though the statistics of the distribution are _ globally _ rotationally invariant .",
    "this is consistent with the structure of strange attractors in low - dimensional dissipative dynamical systems , where the attractor has a local structure which is the cartesian product of a line and a one - dimensional cantor set @xcite .",
    "the second example , figure [ fig : 1.2 ] , is a diffusion - limited aggregation ( dla ) cluster in two dimensions @xcite . the local structure of this set can not be approximated as a cartesian product .",
    "also , if a subset of a dla cluster such as figure [ fig : 1.2 ] is examined at a higher magnification , it does not appear to be more markedly anisotropic in structure .",
    "thus it appears as if some fractal sets , such as that illustrated in figure [ fig : 1.1 ] , may exhibit a pronounced anisotropy under magnification , whereas this effect is much less pronounced ( or possibly absent ) in others , such as figure [ fig : 1.2 ] .",
    "distribution of particles with significant inertia moving in a two - dimensional area - preserving velocity field ( the equations of motion are specified in section [ sec : 3 ] ) .",
    "the particles tend to cluster and for the parameters used in this simulation ( see section [ sec : 3 ] ) the correlation dimension is @xmath8,width=302 ]     distribution of particles determined by a diffusion - limited aggregation ( dla ) process .",
    "this distribution has ( approximately ) the same fractal dimension as figure [ fig : 1.1 ] : @xmath9,width=302 ]    throughout this paper we confine our attention to point sets in the plane , but generalisations to higher dimensions are obvious .",
    "we use the following approach to characterise the local structure of a point set .",
    "take a given element of the set , and consider an ellipse centred on this point , with its semi - minor axis of length @xmath0 and its semi - major axis of length @xmath2 , where @xmath3 .",
    "we assume @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the characteristic lengthscale of the system below which fractal scaling is observable , and that @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the lengthscale where the fractal scaling is cut off by the finite number of points sampling the fractal measure .",
    "we then choose the orientation of the cover so that it maximises the number of other points which are contained in this ellipse .",
    "we denote the number of points under this optimally - oriented cover by @xmath4 .",
    "we repeat this for ellipses centred on other randomly selected points in the set , and compute the average value @xmath15 of the number of points which can be covered . in most of the examples of point - set fractals which we investigated ,",
    "the mean number of points in this ellipse is found to have a power - law dependence : @xmath16 where the exponent @xmath6 depends upon @xmath17 . in the case",
    "where @xmath18 , the ellipse is a circle , so that this case reduces to a definition of the correlation dimension : @xmath19 ( compare with the discussion of the correlation dimension in @xcite ) .",
    "in general @xmath6 must decrease monotonically as @xmath17 decreases .",
    "a related approach to the characterisation of fractal sets was proposed by grassberger and co - workers @xcite , who considered covering a set ( which is embedded in a @xmath20-dimensional space ) with @xmath20-dimensional ellipsoids , with principal axes @xmath21 , ordered so that @xmath22 .",
    "their work emphasises the case where the local structure of the fractal is a cartesian product of sets , with dimensions @xmath23 , ordered so that @xmath24 .",
    "it is asserted that the ellipsoids cover most efficiently when they align with the principal axes , such that the longest axes align with the directions of the highest density sets . according to this hypothesis the number of points covered",
    "is expected to satisfy @xmath25 examining the dependence of @xmath4 upon the @xmath21 would allow the _ partial dimensions _",
    "@xmath23 to be determined .",
    "this approach was mentioned in several papers @xcite , with the motivation to characterise a fractal set by means of its partial dimensions , @xmath23 , satisfying @xmath26 .",
    "these works do not prescribe how ( or whether ) the ratio @xmath27 approaches zero as @xmath28 . in our work",
    "this limiting behaviour is specified by the parameter @xmath17 .",
    "our numerical investigations encompass fractal sets which have a cartesian product structure , and those which do not .    in the case of point",
    "set fractals which represent a physical distribution of particles , the existence of a highly anisotropic local structure has important physical implications for the scattering of light .",
    "it is known that s - wave scattering of light from a fractal point set gives rise to an algebraic relation between the scattering wavenumber @xmath29 and the scattered intensity @xmath30 , such that @xmath31 heuristic arguments supporting this are developed in @xcite ; see @xcite for a discussion of some of the complications which can arise in verifying this suggestion .",
    "the distribution of this scattering intensity may , however , be highly inhomogeneous .",
    "in particular , if the particles have a strong tendency to accumulate along lines in two dimensions ( like the example shown in figure [ fig : 1.1 ] ) , or on planes in higher dimensions , light may scatter specularly from these structures .",
    "we argue that this motivates the investigation of the anisotropic covering with ellipsoids .",
    "consider weak scattering of light with wavelength @xmath0 which propagates as a beam of width @xmath1 .",
    "when the path length for light scattered from different particles is large compared to @xmath0 , the scattering of light from @xmath4 particles is incoherent , so that the contribution to the scattered intensity is @xmath32 .",
    "if , however , an ellipsoid of major axis @xmath1 and minor axis @xmath0 can be aligned to cover @xmath4 particles , then there will exist directions where the path length difference is less than one wavelength , so that this set of @xmath4 particles scatters light coherently ( see figure [ fig : 1.3 ] ) . in these directions where the condition for specular reflection is satisfied by the optimal covering ellipsoid , there is a greatly increased intensity @xmath33 .",
    "scattering of a beam of light with wavevector @xmath34 , width @xmath1 and wavelength @xmath0 : a cluster of @xmath4 particles covered by an @xmath0-@xmath1 ellipse scatters light coherently when the condition for specular reflection is satisfied .",
    "the wavevector @xmath35 satisfies the condition for specular reflection if the major axis of the ellipse is perpendicular to @xmath36 . in this case the scattered intensity from the particles under the cover is increased by a factor of order @xmath4 .",
    ", width=188 ]    we have argued that light scattering from fractal sets may be extremely inhomogeneous because of specular scattering from particles which accumulate on surfaces .",
    "this motivated us to study the covering of a fractal by anisotropic covering sets , and the results are reported here .",
    "we investigate the dependence of the generalised dimension @xmath6 upon the anisotropy exponent @xmath17 .",
    "we show that the form of the function @xmath7 can distinguish between different fractal sets which have the same value of the correlation dimension @xmath19 .",
    "the description of light scattering proved to be a very complex issue , which will be considered elsewhere .",
    "before discussing our numerical investigations , we consider some simple arguments about the form of the generalised dimension @xmath7 , defined by equation ( [ eq : 1.1 ] ) .",
    "first we address the issue of whether the exponent @xmath6 exists . when @xmath18 , the exponent @xmath6 coincides with the correlation dimension of the set . for other values of @xmath17 , we do not know of any general argument which proves that the dependence of the optimal covering @xmath4 has a power law relation to the size @xmath0 of the covering elements . for most of the point - set fractals which we examined we did find good numerical evidence that @xmath5 for small values of @xmath0 ( extending down towards values of @xmath0 where the discrete sampling of the set becomes a limitation ) .",
    "the exceptions occurred for some cases of the motion of inertial particles in a random flow , and for some of the sets considered in section [ sec : 4 ] , including the example illustrated in figure [ fig : 2.1 ] : these are discussed in sections [ sec : 3 ] and [ sec : 4 ] respectively .     in the case where the fractal set is a cartesian product of two cantor sets , with dimensions @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the @xmath39 and @xmath40 directions , the optimal covering ellipse",
    "might be expected to have its major axis aligned with the direction corresponding to the denser set . in the case",
    "@xmath41 , the major axis of the ellipse would be expected to align with the @xmath40-axis ( vertical in this figure ) . here",
    "we illustrate a sample of the actual optimal covers , which have a distribution of angles of their principal axes.,width=245 ]    next we give an upper bound on @xmath7 .",
    "let us consider the expectation @xmath15 for the case where @xmath4 is independent of the orientation of the ellipse .",
    "the total number of particles in a disc of radius @xmath1 is proportional to @xmath42 .",
    "if the set is locally isotropic then the coverage is independent of the angle of the major axis of the ellipse , and a fraction @xmath43 of these points lie in the ellipse . recalling that @xmath2 , for this isotropic fractal we have @xmath44 , so that @xmath45 is an upper bound on the exponent @xmath6 .",
    "we were not able to obtain a precise and non - trivial lower bound for @xmath7 , but the following argument suggests a possible form for a lower bound . consider the case where the point fractal samples a cartesian product of two one - dimensional cantor sets , with dimensions @xmath37 and @xmath38 . in the following we assume that @xmath46 . because the set is denser in the direction of the @xmath40-axis",
    ", we expect that the optimal alignment of each ellipse is when its major axis is aligned with the @xmath40-axis ( the same hypothesis was proposed in @xcite ) .",
    "the expected number of particles captured by a covering ellipse is then @xmath47 , so that the dimension of this product set is @xmath48 now consider the smallest possible dimension which could be achieved according to this argument , if we allow the dimensions @xmath37 , @xmath38 of the component sets to vary so that @xmath49 .",
    "the greatest number of particles in the ellipse , and hence the smallest dimension , is obtained by setting @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "this gives a putative lower bound to the dimension : @xmath52 the assumption that the covering ellipses align precisely with the @xmath40-axis is not really correct , as evidenced by figure [ fig : 2.1 ] .",
    "it is plausible that the probability for an ellipses to be significantly mis - aligned decreases as @xmath53 , but we were not able to obtain conclusive numerical evidence .",
    "we note that the argument leading to the proposed lower bound , @xmath54 , is very similar to that presented in @xcite to motivate the concept of partial dimensions .",
    "in addition to the fact that the optimal covering ellipses do not align perfectly with the preferred axes , there is a further complication which could affect the argument leading to the estimate in equation ( [ eq : 2.3 ] ) . in sets such as that illustrated in figure [ fig :",
    "1.1 ] , the local structure is a cartesian product of a line and a one - dimensional cantor set .",
    "the line is , however , curved .",
    "it is interesting to consider whether this curvature can alter the estimate in equation ( [ eq : 2.3 ] ) . in order to consider the effect of this curvature , introduce two coordinates",
    ": @xmath40 is a coordinate for the expanding ( unstable ) manifold centred on the reference particle and @xmath39 is a coordinate for the stable manifold . because the manifolds are curved , the equation of the unstable manifold will be of the form @xmath55 for small @xmath40 , where @xmath56 is a constant . consider a family of ellipses , with fixed @xmath1 and decreasing @xmath17 which are aligned so as to provide the optimal cover for a cluster centred on a reference particle .",
    "as @xmath17 is reduced , the curvature of the unstable manifold can become important , because it will take a cluster of particles outside the covering ellipse ( see figure [ fig : 2.2 ] ) .",
    "this happens when @xmath57 , that is when @xmath58 .",
    "accordingly , we might propose that the optimal covering strategy of aligning the principal axis of the ellipses with the unstable manifold starts to break down when at a critical value of the exponent , @xmath59 .",
    "on the basis of this argument we would expect that @xmath7 might exceed equation ( [ eq : 2.3 ] ) when @xmath60 , in cases where the fractal is generated by a dynamical system for which the lines representing the unstable manifold are curved .     in many dynamical systems",
    "the attractor is locally a cartesian product of a cantor set and a line .",
    "if this line is curved , an ellipse may cease to be an efficient cover as @xmath17 is decreased .",

    "we find that this expression works well for simple model sets of the type considered in section [ sec : 4 ] , and for the sinai map , where the attractor is locally a cartesian product of a line and a cantor set . in the case of clustering of inertial particles",
    ", however , we find that equation ( [ eq : 2.3 ] ) does not give a good approximation to @xmath7 . in cases where the cantor set does not have a cartesian product structure , we were not able to derive an expression for @xmath7 , and we find persuasive evidence that this function is non - universal .    in three or more dimensions",
    "there may also be a tendency for particles to accumulate on filamentary structures , as well as on planes .",
    "this could be characterised by defining the exponent @xmath6 as a function of two parameters , @xmath155 , @xmath156 defining a covering ellipsoid with principal axes @xmath0 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "this study was partly motivated by the desire to understand the inhomogeneity of light scattering from fractal distributions of particles , but our investigations indicate that this is a very complex problem , which will be considered in a separate publication .    _",
