    "in the analysis of infections with multiple strains simultaneously co - circulating in a population , an important role is played by antigenic diversity , where hosts can be infected multiple times with antigenically different strains of the same parasite , which allows the parasite to maintain its presence in the host population ( craig and scherf 2003 , lipsitch and ohagan 2007 ) .",
    "major examples of pathogens employing antigenic diversity as a strategy of immune escape include malaria ( gupta et al 1994 , recker et al 2004 ) , meningitis ( gupta and anderson 1998 , gupta et al .",
    "1996 ) , dengue ( gog and grenfell 2002 , recker et al 2009 ) , and influenza ( earn et al 2002 , ferguson et al 2003 , smith et al 1999 ) . from the perspective of interactions between different strains",
    ", one can distinguish between two major types of strain interactions : _ ecological interference _ where a host infected with one strain is removed from the population susceptible to other strains ( levin et al 2004 , rohani et al 2003 ) , and _ immunological interference _",
    ", where infection with one strain may confer partial or full immunity to other strains ( gupta and anderson 1998 ) or lead to enhancement of susceptibility or transmissibility of other strains , as is the case for dengue ( recker et al 2009 ) and hpv ( elbasha and galvani 2005 ) .",
    "the underlying mechanism of cross - immunity is generic for all pathogens : an infection with one strain of a pathogen elicits a lasting immune memory protecting the host against infections with other immunologically related strains .    in terms of analysis of the dynamics of multi - strain diseases , in the last twenty years a significant number of mathematical models have been put forward that aim to explore and explain different aspect of interactions between multiple strains . in terms of implementation , one can divide these models into agent- or individual - based models and equation - based models . for the first class of models , pathogen strains are treated as individuals interacting according to some prescribed rules ( buckee et al .",
    "2004 , buckee and gupta 2010 , cisternas et al 2004 , ferguson et al 2003 , sasaki and haraguchi 2000 , tria et al 2005 ) , which allows for efficient stochastic representation of immunological interactions but does provide an intuition arising from analytical tractability .",
    "the second class of models provides two alternative treatments of cross - immunity between strains , known as history - based and status - based approaches . in history - based models ,",
    "the hosts are grouped according to what strains of a pathogen they have already been infected with , and transitions between different compartments , which corresponds to infection with other strains , occur at rates depending on the strength of cross - protection between strains ( andreasen et al 1996 , andreasen et al 1997 , castillo - chavez et al 1989 , gomes et al 2002 , gupta et al 1998 , gupta et al 1996 , lin et al 1999 ) . on the other hand , in status - based models",
    "the hosts are classified not based on their previous exposures to individual strains but rather by their immune status , i.e. the set of strains to which a given host is immune ( gog and grenfell 2002 , gog and swinton 2002 , kryazhimsky et al 2007 ) .",
    "once in a particular immune compartment , upon infection with a new strain individuals move to other immune compartments at rates determined by the probabilities of acquiring cross - immunity against other strains . in this approach ,",
    "partial cross - immunity can make some hosts become completely immune whilst other hosts will not gain immunity from the same exposure - this is known as _ polarized immunity _",
    "( gog and grenfell 2002 ) and is equivalent to an alternative formulation used in the analysis of effects of vaccination ( smith et a 1984 ) .",
    "since different strains of a pathogen form as a result of some common genetic process , they inherit immunological characteristics associated with this process .",
    "a convenient tool quantifying the degree of immunological relatedness between different strains arising from their antigenic structure is the _",
    "antigenic distance _ between strains , which can take into account antigenic structure as determined by the configuration of surface proteins , as well as the difference in antibodies elicited in response to infection with another genotype ( gupta et al 2006 , smith et al 1999 , smith et al 2004 ) .",
    "conventionally , one assumes that the larger is the antigenic distance between two strains , the smaller is the level of cross - immunity between them . in mathematical models of multi - strain diseases , one of the effective ways to include antigenic distance is to use a multi - locus system ( gupta et al 1998 , gupta et al 1996 ) , where each strain is represented by a sequence of @xmath0 loci with @xmath1 alleles in each locus , thus resulting in a discrete antigenic space (",
    "some authors have considered similar set - up in a continuous one - dimensional antigenic space ( adams and sasaki 2007 , andreasen et al 1997 , gog and grenfell 2002 , gomes et al 2002 ) . in this approach , for any two given strains",
    ", the number of locations at which their sequences are identical determines their immunological relatedness , which is taken as a proxy measure of cross - immunity ( calvez et al 2005 , cobey and pascual 2011 , ferguson and andreasen 2002 , gupta et al 1998 , minaev and ferguson 2009 , tria et al 2005 ) .",
    "alternatively , it is possible to map each genotype to a point in antigenic space ( koelle et al 2006 , recker et al 2007 ) and then separately introduce a function that determines the strength of cross - immunity between strains based on their antigenic distance ( adams and sasaki 2007 , andreasen 1997 , gog and grenfell 2002 , gomes et al 2002 ) .",
    "whilst significant progress has been made in the analysis of generic features of multi - strain models and possible types of dynamics they are able to exhibit , the effects of symmetry , which is present in many of the models , have remained largely unexplored .",
    "andreasen et al ( 1997 ) have considered a multi - strain epidemic model with partial cross - immunity between strains .",
    "they analysed stability of the boundary equilibria representing symmetric steady states with only immunologically unrelated strains present , and also showed that the internal endemic equilibrium can undergo hopf bifurcation giving rise to stable periodic oscillations .",
    "furthermore , these authors also demonstrated how this periodic orbit can disappear in a global bifurcation involving a homoclinic orbit through a two - strain equilibrium .",
    "this work was later extended to a system of three linear - chain strains ( lin et al 1999 ) , and again the existence of sustained oscillations arising from a hopf bifurcation of internal endemic equilibrium was shown . dawes and gog ( 2002 ) have considered a generalised model of an sir dynamics with four co - circulating strains and studied possible bifurcations leading to the appearance of periodic behaviour by performing bifurcation unfolding in the regime when the basic reproductive number very slightly exceeds unity .",
    "more recently , chan and yu ( 2013a , b ) have used groupoid formalism to analyse symmetric dynamics in models of antigenic variation and multi - strain dynamics , and they have also demonstrated the emergence of steady state clustering as a result of symmetry properties of the system .",
    "blyuss ( 2013 ) has investigated symmetry properties in a model of antigenic variation in malaria ( see also blyuss and gupta ( 2009 ) for analysis of other related dynamical features ) , and blyuss and kyrychko ( 2012 ) have extended this analysis to study the effects of immune delay on symmetric dynamics .",
    "in this paper we use the techniques of equivariant bifurcation theory to systematically study stability of steady states and classification of different types of periodic behaviour in a multi - strain model . using a classical multi - locus model of gupta et al ( 1998 ) as an example",
    ", we will illustrate how the symmetry in the interactions between strains can provide a handle on understanding steady states and their stability , as well as the emergence of symmetry - breaking periodic solutions .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the specific model to be used for analysis of symmetries in models of multi - strain diseases and discuss its basic properties .",
    "section 3 contains the analysis of steady states and their stability with account for underlying symmetry of the model . in sect .",
    "4 different types of dynamical behaviours in the model are investigated and classified in terms of their symmetries .",
    "section 5 illustrates how a similar methodology can be used for studying other types of multi - strain models .",
    "the paper concludes in sect . 6 with discussion of results and future outlook",
    "in order to study the effects of symmetry on dynamics in multi - strain models , we consider a multi - locus model proposed by gupta et al ( 1998 ) . in this model , @xmath2 denotes a proportion of population who are immune to strain @xmath3 , i.e. those who have been or are currently infected with the strain @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the fraction of population who are currently infectious with the strain @xmath3 , and @xmath5 is the proportion of individuals who have been infected ( or are currently infected ) by a strain antigenically related to the strain @xmath3 , including @xmath3 itself ( with @xmath6 ) .",
    "the model equations can then be written as @xmath7-(\\mu+\\sigma)y_i,}\\\\\\\\ \\displaystyle{\\frac{dz_i}{dt}=\\lambda_i(1-z_i)-\\mu z_i,}\\\\\\\\ \\displaystyle{\\frac{dw_i}{dt}=(1-w_i)\\sum_{j\\sim i}\\lambda_j-\\mu w_i , } \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the force of infection with strain @xmath3 defined as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the transmission rate assumed to be the same for all strains , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the average host life expectancy and the average period of infectiousness , respectively , and @xmath13 @xmath14 is the cross - immunity , giving the reduction in transmission probability conferred by previous infection with one strain .    in terms of disease transmission ,",
    "the population is assumed to be randomly mixed , and upon recovery from infection with a particular strain , the immunity to that strain is lifelong . to characterize strains and their immunological interactions ,",
    "each strain is described by a sequence of antigens consisting of @xmath15 loci , with @xmath16 , @xmath17 , alleles at each locus , so that @xmath18 . in system ( [ gfasys ] ) , expression @xmath19 refers to all strains @xmath20 sharing alleles with strain @xmath3 . in the simplest non - trivial case of a two locus - two allele system represented by alleles @xmath21 and @xmath22 at one locus , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 at the other",
    ", we have a system of four antigenically distinct strains as shown in fig .",
    "[ strains ] .",
    "a simple but justifiable assumption about such system is that as a consequence of immune selection , infection , for instance , with strain @xmath25 will have a negative impact on transmission of strains @xmath26 and @xmath27 but will have no impact on transmission of the strain @xmath28 , as they are completely immunologically distinct ( gupta et al 1996 ) .",
    "hence , when considering the @xmath29 equation for the strain @xmath25 , the sum in the right - hand side will include contributions from strains @xmath26 , @xmath25 and @xmath27 but will exclude strain @xmath28 .    in order to quantify interactions between different strains , it is convenient to introduce an @xmath30 connectivity matrix @xmath31 , whose entries indicate whether or not two strains are antigenically related .",
    "if the antigenic distance between strains is not taken into account , the entries of the matrix @xmath31 would be zeros if the two variants are immunologically completely distinct , and ones if they are related .",
    "several papers have considered how one can make such a description more realistic by including antigenic distance between different strains , which can be done by using , for instance , the hamming between two strings representing alleles in the locus of each strain ( adams and sasaki 2009 , cobey and pascual 2011 , gog and grenfell 2002 , gomes et al 2002 , recker and gupta 2005 ) .",
    "since we are primarily interested in the symmetry properties of the interactions between different strains , we will not consider the effects of antigenic distance on the dynamics .    before proceeding with the analysis of this system , one can reduce the number of free parameters by scaling time with the average infectious period @xmath32 , and we also introduce the basic reproductive ratio @xmath33 and the ratio of a typical infectious period to a typical host lifetime @xmath34 . using the connectivity matrix @xmath31 and the new parameters , the system ( [ gfasys ] ) can be rewritten as follows @xmath35-y_i,}\\\\\\\\ \\displaystyle{\\frac{dz_i}{dt}={\\lambda}_i(1-z_i)-ez_i,}\\\\\\\\",

    "the methods of equivariant bifurcation theory can be employed to obtain useful insights into stability and dynamics of the system , we concentrate on a specific connectivity matrix @xmath31 given in ( [ amat ] ) that corresponds to a two locus - two allele system ( [ var4 ] ) . in this case @xmath43 , and the system ( [ sys ] ) is equivariant under the action of a dihedral group @xmath44 , which is an 8-dimensional symmetry group of a square .",

    "all variants appear sequentially one after another with one sixth of a period difference between two neighbouring variants . from the perspective of equvariant bifurcation theory ,",

    ", this is an extremely important observation that effectively such solution , which represents sequential appearance of antigenically related strains of infection , owes its existence not so much to the individual dynamics of the strains , but rather to the particular symmetric nature of cross - reactive interactions between them .    as the value of @xmath13 increases , the discrete travelling wave transforms into a quasi - periodic solution , and then to a chaotic solution , where different strains appear in no particular order , and the temporal dynamics of each of them is chaotic , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ gfa6_fig](d ) . for higher values of @xmath13 ,",
    "the dynamics becomes periodic again , albeit with a different type of spatio - temporal symmetry , given by @xmath181 , where @xmath182 is a reflection symmetry with respect to a plane going through the edges 2 and 5 , as well as mid - points of the sides 1 - 3 and 4 - 6 .",
    "as @xmath13 increases further still , the system tends to a stable steady state having the symmetry @xmath182 .",
    "this steady state is similar to the case of @xmath51 symmetry considered earlier in that it contains three non - zero strains , with maximal possible antigenic distance between them .",
    "the approach developed in the previous section is sufficiently generic and can be applied to the analysis of a variety of different models for multi - strain diseases , where the existence of a degree of cross - protection ( or cross - enhancement ) between antigenically distinct strains results in a certain symmetry of strain interactions , which then translates into different types of periodic dynamics .",
    "epidemiological data and mathematical models suggest that such systems may exhibit a wide range of behaviours , from no strain structure ( nss ) , which represents a system approaching a stable steady state , through the discrete or cyclic strain structure ( css ) , where the systems demonstrates single strain dominance and sequential trawling through the whole antigenic repertoire , to a chaotic strain structure .",
    "various aspects of the overlapping antigenic repertoires have already been investigated in a number of models , but so far the effects of symmetry in such systems have remained largely unexplored .    as an illustration",
    ", we now use symmetry perspective to analyse simulation results in two different multi - strain models . in the first model ,",
    "analysed by calvez et al ( 2005 ) , each strain is characterized by a combination of alleles at immunologically important loci , and the strength of cross - immunity between different strains increases with the number of alleles they share .",
    "after some rescaling , the model for such a system can be written in the form @xmath183y_i , } \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath184 is the fraction of individuals who have never been infected with the strain @xmath3 , @xmath185 is the faction of individuals who have never been infected with any strain sufficiently close to strain @xmath3 including strain @xmath3 itself , @xmath186 is the rescaled fraction of individuals currently infectious with strain @xmath3 , @xmath187 and @xmath188 , @xmath11 is the host life expectancy , @xmath12 is an average period of infectiousness , @xmath10 is the transmission rate . assuming the probability of cross - protection between strains @xmath3 and @xmath20 to be @xmath189 ( i.e. infection with strain @xmath20 reduces the probability that the host will be infected by strain @xmath3 is @xmath189 ) , the force of infection is taken as @xmath190    when this system is considered with three loci and two alleles at each locus , this results in an eight - dimensional strain space , as illustrated in fig .  [",
    "clus_fig](a ) .",
    "analysis of possible dynamics for such a strain space suggests that `` _ ... it is already not so clear why in the eight - strain system the cluster structure of second type ( two clusters of four strains ) appears _ '' ( calvez et al 2005 ) , which is the solution shown in fig .",
    "[ clus_fig](b)-(c ) .",
    "the authors found this tetrahedral solution unexpected , and indeed stated that `` _ this second type of clustering can hardly be expected a priori _ '' ( calvez et al 2005 ) . at the same time , when considered from the equivariant bifurcation theory perspective , system ( [ gfa ] ) has the octahedral symmetry @xmath191 , and therefore , has three maximal isotropy subgroups : the dihedral group @xmath192 , the permutation group @xmath193 , and a reflection group @xmath194 ( jiang et al 2003 , melbourne 1986 ) .",
    "hence , the bifurcation of a fully symmetric steady state into a tetrahedral periodic solution with @xmath51 symmetry should be naturally expected as a result of an equivariant hopf theorem and an underlying symmetric structure of the antigenic space ( fiedler 1988 , jiang et al 2003 ) .",
    "this example highlights the importance of including symmetry properties of multi - strain epidemic models into consideration of possible steady states and periodic orbits , as it provides a systematic approach to understanding what types of periodic solutions should be expected in the system from a symmetry perspective .    as another example , we consider a model for the population dynamics of dengue fever , which is characterized by an infection with one of four serotypes co - circulating in population .",
    "one of the main current theories explaining the observed dynamics of dengue fever is that of antibody - dependent enhancement ( ade ) , whereby cross - reactive antibodies elicited by a previously encountered serotype bind to the newly infecting heterologous serotype , but fail to neutralize it .",
    "this leads to the development of dengue haemorrhagic fever ( dhf ) and dengue shock syndrome ( dss ) , characterized by up to 20% mortality rate ( gubler 2002 , halstead 2007 ) .    in order to explain the observed temporal patterns of disease dynamics , recker et al ( 2009 ) have proposed a model , which assumes that a recovery from an infection with any one serotype is taken to provide permanent immunity against that particular serotype , but it can lead to an enhancement of other serotypes upon secondary infection after which individuals acquire complete immunity against all four serotypes . in this model",
    "the population is divided into the following classes : @xmath195 denotes the fraction of the population that has not yet been infected with any of the serotypes and is thus totally susceptible ; @xmath186 is the proportion infectious with a primary infection with serotype @xmath3 , @xmath196 is the proportion recovered from primary infection with serotype @xmath3 ; @xmath197 is the proportion infectious with serotype @xmath20 , having already recovered from infection with serotype @xmath3 ; and , finally , @xmath42 is the proportion of completely immune ( those who have recovered after being exposed to two serotypes ) .",
    "the model equations are given as follows @xmath198 where @xmath11 is the average host life expectancy , and @xmath12 is the average duration of infectiousness .",
    "the force of infection with a serotype @xmath3 , @xmath8 is given by @xmath199 where @xmath200 is the transmission coefficient of serotype @xmath3 , and the ade is represented by two distinct parameters : the enhancement of susceptibility to secondary infections , @xmath201 , and the enhancement of transmissibility during secondary infection , @xmath202 .",
    "although in this case the antigenic space again consists of four distinct serotypes , but unlike earlier examples of dihedral symmetry the system now has an @xmath203 symmetry of four nodes with an all - to - all coupling . for simplicity , it is assumed that all serotypes enhance each other in identical way , i.e. @xmath204 , and also transmissibility is enhanced in the same way , implying that @xmath205 . hence , we fix all other parameters , and vary @xmath13 and @xmath206 to explore possible dynamical regimes .",
    "figure  [ den_fig ] illustrates different types of behaviour that can be exhibited by the system ( [ reck_eq ] ) as the enhancement of susceptibility @xmath13 and enhancement of transmissibility @xmath206 are varied . in the case when both @xmath13 and @xmath206 are sufficiently small ( equal to or just above 1 ) , the system approaches a stable fully symmetric steady state shown in fig .",
    "[ den_fig](a ) .",
    "as the enhancement of transmissibility @xmath206 increases , the fully symmetric steady state loses stability via a hopf bifurcation , giving rise to a fully symmetric periodic orbit , as illustrated in fig .  [ den_fig](b ) .",
    "depending on the values of @xmath13 and @xmath206 , it is possible to observe other types of periodic solutions : a solution where three serotypes have identical dynamics , and the fourth serotype has a different dynamics ( see fig .",
    "[ den_fig](c ) ) , and a solution with the symmetry of reflections across diagonals shown in fig .",
    "[ den_fig](d ) , where antigenically distinct strains have the same behaviour . for higher values of @xmath13 and @xmath206 ,",
    "the dynamics becomes quasi - periodic and eventually chaotic .",
    "in this paper we have shown how one can use the techniques of equivariant bifurcation theory to systematically approach the analysis of stability of steady states and classification of different periodic solutions in multi - strain epidemic models .",
    "once the underlying symmetry of the system has been established , the steady states can be grouped together using conjugacy classes of the corresponding isotropy subgroups , which significantly reduces computational effort associated with studying their stability . moreover",
    ", isotypic decomposition of the phase space based on irreducible representations of the symmetry group provides a convenient way of identifying the specific symmetry of a periodic solution emerging from a hopf bifurcation of the fully symmetric equilibrium .",
    "the @xmath160 theorem provides an account of possible types of spatial and temporal symmetries that can be exhibited by periodic solutions , and hence is very useful for systematic classification of observed periodic behaviours .",
    "an important question is to what degree real multi - strain diseases can be efficiently described by mathematical models with symmetry , bearing in mind that in reality systems of antigenic strains may not always fully preserve the assumed symmetry .",
    "there are several observations suggesting that the results of analysis of symmetric models are still applicable for understanding the dynamics of real multi - strain infections .",
    "the first of these comes from the fact that many features of the model solutions , such as single - strain dominance and sequential appearance of antigenically related strains in a manner similar to the discrete travelling wave solution discussed earlier , are also observed in epidemiological data ( gupta et al 1998 , minaev and ferguson 2009 , recker et al 2009 , recker et al 2007 ) .",
    "another reason why the conclusions drawn from symmetric models may still hold stems from an argument based on normal hyperbolicity , which is a generic property in such models , suggesting that the main phenomena associated with symmetric models survive under perturbations , including symmetry - breaking perturbations .",
    "the discussion of this issue in the context of modelling sympatric speciation using symmetric models can be found in golubitsky and stewart ( 2002 ) .",
    "andreasen et al ( 1997 ) have discussed the situation when the basic reproductive ratios of different strains may vary , showing that in this case the endemic equilibrium persists and can still give rise to stable periodic oscillations through a hopf bifurcation .",
    "similar issue was discussed by dawes and gog ( 2002 ) who also noted that despite the possibility of oscillations in multi - strain models , quite often the period of such oscillations is comparable to the host lifetime and hence is much longer than the periodicity of real epidemic outbreaks .",
    "one possibility how this limitation may be overcome is when there is a sufficiently large number of co - circulating strains , so that the combinations of some of them rising or falling would result in a rapid turnover of the dominant strain , as has been shown in gupta et al ( 1998 ) .",
    "reaching a definitive conclusion regarding the validity of symmetric or almost - symmetric multi - strain models requires a precise measurement of population - level transmission rates individual strains , as well as degrees of immunological cross - protection or cross - enhancement , and despite major advances in viral genotyping and infectious disease surveillance , this still remains a challenge .",
    "a really important methodological advantage of the approach presented in this paper is its genericity in a sense that the analysis of stability and periodic dynamics relies on the symmetries in immunological interactions between strains , rather than any specific information regarding their individual dynamics as prescribed by a disease under consideration .",
    "the fact that some of the fundamental dynamical features in the behaviour of multi - strain diseases appear to be universal suggests a possibility to make significant inroads in the understanding generic types of dynamics using the analysis of some recurring motifs of strain interactions with relatively simple topology . in the model",
    "analysed in this paper , we were primarily concerned with symmetric properties of the matrix of antigenic connectivity and assumed that the strength of immunological cross - reactivity is the same for all strains .",
    "one can make the model more realistic by explicitly including the antigenic distance between strains in manner similar to the hamming distance ( adams and sasaki 2009 , calvez et al 2005 , recker and gupta 2005 ) , which would not alter the topology of the network of antigenic variants but introduce different weights for connections between different strains in the network .",
    "another possibility is to consider the effects of time delay in latency or temporary immunity ( arino and van den driessche 2006 , blyuss and kyrychko 2010 , lloyd 2001 ) , which although known to play an important role in disease dynamics , have so far not been studied in the context of multi - strain diseases .",
