    "gaussian random walks prove to be a natural and rather universal starting point for many stochastic processes .",
    "in fact , the famous _ central - limit theorem _ shows that many independent random movements of finite variance @xmath0 always pile up to display a gaussian distribution @xcite .",
    "in particular , gaussian random walks constitute the basis of the most important tool in the theory of financial markets , the black - scholes option price theory @xcite ( nobel prize 1997 ) , by which a portfolio of assets is hoped to remain steadily growing through hedging @xcite .",
    "however , since the last stock market crash and the still ongoing financial crisis it has become clear that distributions which describe realistically the behaviour of financial markets belong to a more general universality class , the so - called lvy stable distribution @xcite .",
    "they result from a sum of random movements of infinite variance @xcite , and account for the fact that rare events , the so - called black - swan events @xcite , which initiate crashes , are much more frequent than in gaussian distributions .",
    "these are events in the so - called lvy tails @xmath1 of the distributions , whose description is based on a generalized hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath2 such tail - events are present in many physical situations , e.g. , in velocity distributions of many body systems with long - range forces @xcite , in the self - similar distribution of matter in the universe @xcite , and in the distributions of windgusts @xcite and earthquakes @xcite , with often catastrophic consequences .",
