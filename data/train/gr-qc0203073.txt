    "the analysis of observations in einstein s general relativity theory is a rather complicated issue in contrast with the elegant simplicity of the geometric structure of the theory  @xcite .",
    "take , for instance , the excess perihelion precession of mercury that was explained by einstein in 1915 and provided the first major success of general relativity .",
    "this standard theoretical result follows from the solution of the geodesic equation in the post - newtonian approximation .",
    "however , the relevant observational results are usually obtained by monitoring the motion of mercury from the earth via electromagnetic radiation that is reflected by mercury and reaches astronomical telescopes on the earth . in effect",
    ", one has to deal with the _ relative _ motion of one geodesic ( `` mercury '' ) with respect to the other ( `` earth '' )  @xcite .",
    "ideally , the observer following the reference geodesic sets up in its neighborhood a laboratory , where the measuring devices are assumed to work as in inertial spacetime . this local inertial frame of the observer",
    "is represented by the fermi coordinate system . to construct such a coordinate patch , an orthonormal set of ideal gyroscopes would be required to define the local spatial frame of the observer , while an ideal standard clock would measure the observer s proper time .",
    "the reduced equation of geodesic motion of a nearby particle in such a system is the generalized jacobi equation that will be studied in this paper .",
    "the results may be applied to high energy astrophysical phenomena as well as precision measurements in space involving the tidal field of the earth or an incident gravitational wave .    in a congruence of timelike geodesics ,",
    "neighboring curves have rates of separation that are usually negligible compared to the speed of light in vacuum @xmath1 . in this case",
    "the geodesic deviation equation is the standard jacobi equation  @xcite .",
    "there are physical circumstances , however , where the worldlines of adjacent geodesics diverge rapidly .",
    "consider , for instance , a congruence of test particles with a common initial velocity falling toward a black hole such that depending on their impact parameters , some particles would be captured by the black hole , while others would escape its gravitational pull .",
    "though the geodesics are neighboring as they approach the black hole , the rate of separation between the particles that fall in and those that are merely deflected would no longer be small compared to @xmath1 .",
    "this example makes it clear that the relevant equation of relative motion , i.e. the generalized jacobi equation , has a limited domain of applicability , since rapidly diverging geodesics would no longer be adjacent after a period of time that is characteristic of the spacetime curvature  that is , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the radius of curvature .",
    "the investigation of the relative motion of neighboring observers following arbitrary timelike curves leads to the general deviation equation .",
    "the relativistic theory of tides is based on the general _ geodesic _ deviation equation .",
    "this is rather complicated when the rate of separation of geodesics could be close to the speed of light ; therefore , we confine our detailed discussion here to a limited form of this equation that is valid to first order in the relative separation ( i.e.  the generalized jacobi equation ) . on the other hand , in the ( `` nonrelativistic '' ) case where a smooth geodesic congruence is given ,",
    "a general treatment of the geodesic deviation equation is available ; in fact , a new derivation can be found in the recent work of kerner , van holten and colistete  @xcite who also give a novel application : they use the geodesic deviation equation together with poincar s perturbation method to approximate bounded ( eccentric ) geodesics in the schwarzschild metric that are close to circular geodesics .",
    "the generalized jacobi equation is discussed in detail in section  2 ; in particular , we are interested in the dynamical system represented by this nonlinear equation , where the nonlinearity is due to the existence of velocity - dependent terms in the system .",
    "therefore , we present a detailed analysis of its hamiltonian structure .    to illustrate certain general dynamical features of the generalized jacobi equation , we consider the relative motion of neighboring test particles in the field of a plane gravitational wave in section  3 and in the exterior field of a gravitating source in section  4 .",
    "we note that many compact astrophysical systems emit powerful oppositely - directed jets that are highly collimated .",
    "no basic theory of astrophysical jets is available at present , though many  especially magnetohydrodynamic  models have been proposed . in particular , the physical processes that determine the asymptotic speed of the bulk flow are not clear at this time",
    ". of particular interest in this connection is the relevance of the relative radial motion described in section  4 to the `` terminal '' bulk motion of a relativistic jet once such an outflow is beyond the active region around the source and the bulk motion is subject only to the gravitational attraction of the source . taking only the relativistic tidal forces into account",
    ", we demonstrate in this case the presence of an `` attractor '' at a lorentz factor @xmath4 , corresponding to @xmath5 , for the terminal bulk motion of a jet relative to the ambient medium .",
    "finally , section  5 contains a discussion of our results . in the following sections , we use units such that @xmath6 .",
    "the generalized jacobi equation in fermi coordinates can be simply obtained by writing an alternative form of the geodesic equation , i.e. the _ reduced _ geodesic equation   below , in fermi coordinates . however , to clarify the hamiltonian and lagrangian aspects of this equation , it is useful to proceed as in the following subsections .",
    "as is well - known , the geodesic equation in local coordinates @xmath7 on a pseudo - riemannian manifold with metric @xmath8 is equivalent to the euler - lagrange equation for the lagrangian @xmath9 where @xmath10 the canonical momentum is given by @xmath11 and @xmath12 is an arbitrary parameter ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the euler - lagrange equation for this system is equivalent to @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the christoffel symbols .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is @xmath15 which is independent of the parameter @xmath12 ; thus , @xmath16 is constant on geodesics .",
    "it follows that along a geodesic @xmath12 is a linear function of @xmath17 .",
    "let us specialize to a four - dimensional lorentzian manifold where we take an admissible coordinate chart and the sign convention @xmath18 for the lorentzian metric .",
    "we will also use the einstein summation rules ; greek indices run from zero to three and latin indices run from one to three .",
    "moreover , round brackets around indices denote symmetrization , while square brackets denote antisymmetrization .    the timelike geodesics ( @xmath19 ) with energy @xmath20",
    "have @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the proper time along the geodesic such that @xmath23 .",
    "we will determine the isoenergetic reduction for the hamiltonian system restricted to this manifold .",
    "the hamiltonian equations of motion ( where we have assumed for simplicity that @xmath24 ; that is , the mass of the free test particle is normalized to unity ) are given by @xmath25 reduction is accomplished by first separating the pairs of canonically conjugate variables @xmath26 into time and space variables ; that is , we take @xmath27 so that points in spacetime with energy @xmath28 satisfy the equation @xmath29 because the flow of time does not stop along the worldline of an observer , we have @xmath30 .",
    "hence , by hamilton s equations , the partial derivative @xmath31 does not vanish . by the implicit function theorem",
    ", there is a function @xmath32 such that @xmath33 that is , the energy surface is ( locally ) the graph of @xmath32 . of course",
    ", we can also solve explicitly for @xmath32 .",
    "indeed , because @xmath34 in an admissible chart we can complete the square with respect to @xmath35 in equation   to obtain @xmath36 where @xmath37 hence , @xmath38 we note that @xmath39 is the inverse of the spatial metric @xmath40 ; that is , @xmath41 .    on the energy surface , the equation @xmath42 decouples from the system  .",
    "by computing the partial derivatives with respect to @xmath43 and @xmath44 on both sides of equation  , we obtain the identities @xmath45 using these relations , the hamiltonian system   for the spatial variables can be expressed as @xmath46 where @xmath47 since @xmath48 is the timelike variable .",
    "hence , the remaining `` spatial '' equations in the hamiltonian system   can be recast into the time - dependent hamiltonian system ( `` the isoenergetic reduction '' ) @xmath49 with hamiltonian @xmath50 .",
    "the hamiltonian isoenergetic reduction procedure is equivalent to a lagrangian procedure .",
    "in fact , let us define the lagrangian  @xcite @xmath51^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath52 , the minus sign under the square root ensures that @xmath53 is real and the other minus sign is to conform with the sign convention used in the hamiltonian system  .",
    "we now have @xmath54^{-1/2}\\ ] ] and the corresponding time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath55 is given by @xmath56 where we have used the fact that the proper time @xmath22 along the geodesic worldline is such that @xmath57 .",
    "hence @xmath58 in system  .",
    "this reduced system is equivalent to the second - order differential equation @xmath59 which is the reduced geodesic equation . to prove this fact ,",
    "note that the hamiltonian or lagrangian equations of motion are equivalent to the euler - lagrange equation @xmath60^{-1/2 } \\big]}\\\\ & & = \\frac{1}{2}(g_{00,i}+2 g_{0j , i } v^j+g_{kl , i } v^kv^\\ell ) [ -(g_{00}+2 g_{0i } v^i+g_{ij } v^iv^j)]^{-1/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us use the proper time @xmath22 to recast equation   in the form @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "after computation of the derivative by the product rule , the equation can be rearranged to the equivalent form @xmath63 we multiply both sides of the last equation by @xmath64 and use the identity @xmath65 to show that @xmath66 also , using the identity @xmath67 we have the equation @xmath68    we claim that @xmath69 to prove this identity , we replace @xmath70 by its defined value , multiply through by @xmath71 and then use the antisymmetry of the last two terms in the resulting expression to conclude that @xmath72 a calculation shows that the right - hand side of this last equation is equal to @xmath73 and therefore it is equal to zero , since @xmath74 .    after multiplying equation   by @xmath71 , we use equation   to see that @xmath75 since @xmath76 . by inserting this equality into equation",
    ", it follows that @xmath77 in particular , if @xmath78 , then @xmath79 and if @xmath80 , then @xmath81    using the chain rule , we have that @xmath82 by inserting this identity into equation   and by replacing @xmath83 with @xmath84 , we obtain equation   with its left - hand side multiplied by the nonzero factor @xmath85 .",
    "this proves the desired result .",
    "the generalized jacobi equation is the linearization of the reduced geodesic equation   in fermi coordinates with respect to the space variables , but not their velocities .",
    "we will obtain the explicit expression for this equation in fermi coordinates valid in a cylindrical spacetime region along the worldline of a reference observer , which is at rest at the spatial origin of the fermi coordinates ( see appendix  a ) .",
    "this is perhaps the most useful form of the generalized jacobi equation .    for an arbitrary spacetime ,",
    "when a reference observer ( that follows a geodesic ) in a coordinate chart @xmath86 is specified , we can always find a fermi coordinate system @xmath87 in a neighborhood of the worldline of the fiducial observer so that the metric tensor is given by @xmath88 where @xmath89 are the components of the riemann tensor projected onto the orthonormal tetrad frame @xmath90 that is parallel propagated along the worldline of the reference observer at rest at the spatial origin of the fermi chart ( cf .",
    "appendix  a ) . by expanding the coefficients of the reduced geodesic equation   for the metric expressed in the fermi coordinates and retaining only the first - order terms in the spatial directions , we obtain the generalized jacobi equation @xmath91 where @xmath92 .",
    "alternatively , we could start from the hamiltonian equations   and substitute in the hamiltonian for @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 expansions corresponding to equations   and recover equation   directly from hamilton s equations  ; this is done in appendix  b. the generalized jacobi equation in arbitrary spacetime coordinates is given in appendix  c.    it is interesting to note a special scaling property of equation  . to this end ,",
    "we let @xmath3 denote the radius of curvature ; it is defined here so that @xmath96 is the supremum of the absolute magnitudes of the components of the riemann tensor over the coordinate patch where the fermi coordinates are defined .",
    "we will use the natural rescaling of the generalized jacobi equation given by @xmath97 in fact , under this rescaling the generalized jacobi equation maintains its form except that each component of the riemann tensor is multiplied by @xmath98 .",
    "the scaled equation is valid for @xmath99 and for arbitrary velocities whose magnitudes do not exceed the speed of light @xmath6 .",
    "the requirement that @xmath100 would naturally imply that in most cases the generalized jacobi equation would hold for a limited interval of time @xmath101 starting from some initial state at @xmath102 such that @xmath103 .",
    "the hamiltonian dynamics of the generalized jacobi equation will be explored in the following section for relative motion in the field of a plane gravitational wave .",
    "the dimensionless fermi coordinates @xmath104 introduced in equation   will only be employed in the latter part of section  3 and should not be confused with the usual local coordinates that are used to express the spacetime metric of the plane wave below .",
    "in this section we will determine the generalized jacobi equation for a _ plane _ gravitational wave given by the metric @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are functions of retarded time @xmath108 .",
    "this metric is a solution of einstein s field equations in vacuum ( @xmath109 ) provided that @xmath110 under this assumption , the gravitational field is of petrov type @xmath111 ( see  @xcite ) and represents a plane wave propagating along the positive @xmath112-axis .",
    "when @xmath113 and @xmath114 , the metric reduces to a linear plane gravitational wave in the @xmath115-@xmath115 gauge that is linearly polarized ( `` @xmath116 '' ) .",
    "any observer that remains at rest at spatial coordinates @xmath117 follows a geodesic of this spacetime .",
    "this is a consequence of a more general result discussed in appendix  d.    let us consider the reference observer at rest at the spatial origin .",
    "we claim that the orthonormal tetrad frame of this observer @xmath118 is parallel propagated along its worldline ; that is , @xmath119 it follows from appendix  d that the worldline of this observer lies on a geodesic ( that is , the last equation holds for @xmath120 ) , so it suffices to show that the equation holds for @xmath121 .",
    "in fact , because the nonzero components of @xmath122 are @xmath123 it is easy to see that @xmath124 satisfies the equation . the desired result for @xmath125 and @xmath126",
    "follows from the fact that @xmath127 and @xmath128 in equation   are respectively equal to @xmath129 and @xmath130 up to a sign factor .    to obtain the generalized jacobi equation for the reference observer",
    ", we must compute the fermi components of curvature along its worldline . since the observer is at rest at the origin ( @xmath131 )",
    ", these components will be functions of its proper time @xmath132 only .",
    "in fact , for @xmath133 we have that @xmath134 are the only nonzero components except for the symmetries of the riemann tensor . in the fermi system ,",
    "the spatial coordinates @xmath135 are characterized invariantly with respect to the tetrad system as described in appendix  a.    by inserting the curvature components into the generalized jacobi equation   with @xmath136 , we have the following system of second - order differential equations : @xmath137 ,   \\\\ \\nonumber \\ddot y&=&-\\frac{1}{3 } k(t)\\ {     2 x\\dot y ( \\dot x+\\dot y^2-\\dot z^2 )       -y[3 + 2 \\dot y ^2 ( \\dot x-3)-6 \\dot x+2 \\dot x ^2]\\\\              \\nonumber & & { } + 2 z\\dot y\\dot z(\\dot x -3)\\ } , \\\\ \\nonumber \\ddot z&=&\\frac{1}{3 } k(t)\\ {      2 x\\dot z ( \\dot x-\\dot y ^2+\\dot z ^2)+2 y\\dot y\\dot z(\\dot x -3)\\\\        & & { } -z[3 + 2\\dot z ^2(\\dot x-3)-6\\dot x+2 \\dot x ^2]\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we note that this system is invariant under the transformation @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "the generalized jacobi system   with its velocity - dependent nonlinearities may conceivably have practical applications in the future for the case of space - based gravitational wave detectors such as lisa  @xcite .",
    "system   has a seven - dimensional extended state space such that the five - dimensional submanifolds @xmath142 are invariant .",
    "the extended state space is simply the space of positions , velocities and time .",
    "on the three - dimensional invariant intersection of these manifolds , the flow is given by @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "that is , equations   permit the uniform motion of a particle along the direction of wave propagation relative to the fiducial particle .",
    "this is due to the transverse character of the gravitational wave .",
    "since the corresponding two - parameter family of solutions is @xmath145 , the relative motion is always unstable .",
    "that is , most members of this two - parameter family of geodesics diverge from the reference geodesic , which is the member of this family with @xmath146 .    in the small-@xmath107 approximation for a monochromatic wave with @xmath114 ,",
    "the curvature is given by @xmath147 ; hence , the assumption that @xmath148 results in the curvature @xmath149 , where @xmath150 , @xmath151 is the wave frequency and @xmath152 is a constant phase . in this case , the radius of curvature is @xmath153 and , using the scaled variables  , system   maintains its form except that @xmath154 is replaced by @xmath155 , where @xmath156 . it is convenient therefore to define a new temporal variable @xmath157 and consider the equivalent first - order system with @xmath158 where a prime denotes differentiation with respect to the new `` fast '' time @xmath159 .",
    "each component of the vector field corresponding to the resulting first - order system has order @xmath160 and is @xmath161-periodic .",
    "this system is therefore in the correct form for averaging with respect to the temporal variable .    by averaging to second - order in the small parameter @xmath160",
    ", we transform system   ( by a near - identity nonautonomous change of variables ) to a system that is autonomous to second - order in @xmath160 . in fact",
    ", the second - order approximation of the averaged system is given by @xmath162 this second - order approximation is not affected by the nonlinear terms in the generalized jacobi equation ; that is , the result would be the same for the corresponding jacobi equation .",
    "the effect of the nonlinearities first appears in the third - order averaged system , i.e. at order @xmath163 .",
    "let us note that taking into account the first - order approximation in @xmath160 only , the approximation procedure suggests that on average @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 are not affected by the presence of the wave ; that is , to first order in @xmath160 , @xmath167 . in case @xmath168 , the first correction to this approximation ",
    "necessary only for @xmath169 and @xmath170is obtained from the second - order approximation of the averaged system  ; in fact , we have that @xmath171 it follows from these results that for @xmath172 , the motion is on average unaffected by the presence of the wave to first order in @xmath173 , as expected from the form of equation  .",
    "moreover , equations   ignore nonlinearities in the system   and are therefore valid for the jacobi equation averaged to order @xmath173 .",
    "it should be noted that for the jacobi equation the motions in @xmath165 and @xmath166 are stable as follows from an analysis of the corresponding mathieu equations .",
    "this is not in conflict with equations   since to see this stability one has to average to higher orders than @xmath174 .",
    "the dynamical behavior of the generalized jacobi system   is complicated by its high dimensionality and the velocity - dependent nonlinear terms . on the other hand , the system is hamiltonian and if @xmath175 is periodic , we expect some dynamical effects associated with hamiltonian chaos : resonance phenomena , stochastic regions and diffusion .",
    "while an investigation of these phenomena is beyond the scope of this paper , we illustrate the existence of hamiltonian chaos in generalized jacobi equations for the simpler system with @xmath176 degrees of freedom given by @xmath177 where @xmath178 and @xmath175 is a periodic function .",
    "this equation of relative motion is obtained from the generalized jacobi equation by limiting attention to a two - dimensional world , i.e.  a surface @xmath179 , where @xmath175 is the gaussian curvature of the surface ( cf .",

    "it is interesting to remark that the equivalent first - order system @xmath181    is hamiltonian with respect to the symplectic form @xmath182 in the region of the state space where @xmath183 .",

    "we limit our attention to @xmath222 , since it follows from equation   that this is the relevant case for motion away from a kerr source ( @xmath223 ) .    for the negative curvature case we consider the asymptotic stability of the invariant sets @xmath224 in the extended state space for equation  . for example",

    "it can be shown that asymptotic stability is essentially determined by the linearized first - order system along @xmath225 , i.e. the system involving the linear approximation @xmath227 of @xmath228 and @xmath229 of @xmath230 that is given by @xmath231q.\\ ] ] by integration of system  , we find that the invariant set @xmath225 of the equation   is positively asymptotically stable if for each real number @xmath232 we have @xmath233 this result has a useful corollary : if @xmath208 is asymptotic to a negative constant multiple of @xmath234 with @xmath235 as @xmath236 , then @xmath225 is asymptotically stable .",
    "let us note that if @xmath237 in the differential equation  , then there is a real solution only if the right - hand side of the differential equation is positive . in this case",

    "the results may be relevant respectively to future space - based gravitational wave detectors and high - energy astrophysical phenomena associated with jets .",
    "the bulk speed of galactic `` superluminal '' jets appears to be constant and estimated to be around 90% of the speed of light , though many uncertainties are associated with this estimate  @xcite .",
    "jet motion is detected via the temporal evolution of the radiation intensity contours relative to the background , which would indicate the motion of blobs ( electron clouds ) in the jet relative to the ambient medium .",
    "this motion , under the influence of gravitation alone , is described by the generalized jacobi equation as discussed in detail in the previous section . in this case",
    ", the generalized jacobi equation exhibits an attractor with constant speed @xmath250 , approximately equal to 70% of the speed of light .",
    "assuming that far from the source gravitational tidal forces are dominant , it follows from our results that the jet speed should approach @xmath250 from above and below over a certain characteristic timescale .",
