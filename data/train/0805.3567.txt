    "arrays of closely - spaced nanoparticles are currently becoming a model system for fundamental studies of mesoscopic charge transport and for targeted applications in nanotechnology .",
    "@xcite quite generally , their behavior depends on the competition of several energy scales that can be controlled independently by tuning the properties of the particles and their geometric arrangement .",
    "these are the mean energy level spacing , the coulomb charging energy for a single particle , as well as the tunnel energy associated with the inter - particle coupling .",
    "@xcite    even for particles that individually are simple metals , the array as a whole can exhibit the full range from strong , exponential ( `` insulating '' ) to weak , non - exponential ( `` metallic '' ) temperature dependence of the conductance . this behavior can be tuned by the strength of coupling between the building blocks - the bare , high - temperature tunneling conductance @xmath5 . in the regime of strong coupling ,",
    "the coulomb interaction is screened and electrons propagate easily . in the opposite limit of the weak coupling ,",
    "single electron charging becomes significant , leading to coulomb blockade behavior and the localization of electrons on individual particles .",
    "@xcite as a results , arrays with strong coupling @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the quantum conductance , behave as metals , while arrays with @xmath8 are insulators in the low - temperature , low - bias limit .",
    "the overall , global transport properties arising from local , charging - mediated tunneling have been investigated experimentally for a number of systems formed from metallic or semiconducting nanoparticles .",
    "@xcite close - packed two - dimensional arrays of highly size - controlled metal nanocrystals , in particular , have served to elucidate the effect of structural disorder , such as imperfections in the particle arrangements , on the current - voltage characteristics  @xcite and to test predictions  @xcite for quenched charge disorder .",
    "@xcite charge disorder arises from variations in the local chemical potentials , due to polarization by trapped parasitic charges in the substrate or in the ligand shells surrounding the particles . in practice ,",
    "charge disorder is unavoidable for arrays involving more than a few particles and , as a consequence , tunneling occurs along paths that optimize the overall energy cost .",
    "this results in two distinct regimes . at applied bias voltages large enough to overcome local coulomb energy costs",
    ", transport occurs by sequential tunneling between neighboring particles along a set of optimal paths .",
    "@xcite at small bias and low temperatures , sequential tunneling is suppressed by the coulomb blockade . in this regime , conduction involves higher - order , cooperative tunneling processes , so - called cotunneling events , that can transport charge over distances of several particles without incurring the full coulomb energy costs .",
    "@xcite by virtue of the uncertainty principle , this is possible through the creation of short - lived excitations on the intermediate particles . in arrays of metallic nanoparticles and for temperatures from a few kelvin on up ,",
    "these excitations consist of electron - hole pairs , produced by cotunneling events in which one electron tunnels onto a particular particle while simultaneously another , lower energy electron tunnels off ( inelastic cotunneling ) .",
    "recently we investigated electron transport through large , highly - ordered metal nanoparticle arrays with lateral size of 65 - 70 particles between the electrodes .",
    "@xcite we found that the resulting , current - voltage characteristics as well as the temperature dependence of the conductance for small applied bias voltages are in line with predictions based on multiple inelastic cotunneling .",
    "@xcite in particular , our results indicated that low - temperature , low - bias transport across the full array occurs via a sequence of cotunneling events , each involving a few particles ( up to @xmath9 ) , depending on temperature .",
    "this temperature - dependent cotunneling distance was interpreted as resulting from an optimization process that weighs the likelihood of n - electron , cooperative cotunneling events against the net energy cost .    in the present paper",
    "we extend these results and specifically address the question about what sets the cotunneling distance .",
    "this characteristic length scale not only determines the low - bias current - voltage characteristics , but also the temperature dependence of the zero - bias conductance .",
    "we present results from experiments in which the distance between electrodes has been tuned to become commensurate with the cotunneling distance .",
    "these experiments involve vertical transport through carefully prepared stacks of particle layers , up to four layers in height .",
    "this approach provides a means to control the number of tunnel junctions the electron traverses to get across the electrodes , allowing us to test the cotunneling scenario in detail .",

    "[ expresult ] our experimental results for the evolution of the @xmath0 characteristics as a function of temperature and stack thickness .",
    "we compare results obtained from vertical transport through stacks of layers to in - plane measurements on monolayers and tetralayers and discuss these data within the context of recent models for charging - energy - mediated tunneling transport .",
    "[ concl ] contains brief conclusions .",
    "the purpose of this section is to discuss the general features of the current - voltage characteristics predicted for nanoparticle arrays in the semi - classical coulomb blockade regime and in the cotunneling regime .",
    "the semiclassical or `` orthodox theory '' of coulomb blockade predicts exponential suppression of the conductance at low temperatures .",
    "@xcite in the zero - bias limit this suppression leads to @xmath10 $ ] for transport through a single nanoparticle connected by tunnel junctions to electrodes . here",
    "@xmath11 is the charging energy , for a weakly coupled particle approximated by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the dielectric constant , @xmath14 the permittivity of free space , and @xmath15 is the particle radius .",
    "the bare conductance @xmath5 corresponds to the temperature - independent ohmic tunnel conductance a junction would have in the absence of all charging effects . for nanoparticles , small",
    "@xmath15 implies large @xmath16 and thus a significant suppression of sequential tunneling at low temperatures .",
    "conduction then occurs by one of two means : at sufficiently large applied bias voltage , the coulomb blockade is overcome so that sequential tunneling can commence . in arrays",
    ", this happens for @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a global coulomb threshold voltage discussed below .",
    "conversely , while a coulomb blockade prevents direct sequential tunneling for @xmath19 , cotunneling becomes a viable conduction channel .",
    "we note here that , for logic or switching devices based on single electron tunneling , cotunneling typically needs to be avoided . in principle , arrays are well - suited for this purpose since the probability for system - spanning cotunnel events decreases dramatically with increasing system array size while @xmath18 increases linearly .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , as we show here , multiple shorter cotunnel events still can contribute significantly to the overall conduction .      applying the semiclassical picture to large arrays of nanoparticles with a random distribution of local chemical potentials , middleton and",
    "wingreen showed that , at @xmath21k , conduction only occurs beyond a global threshold voltage , @xmath22 , where n is the number of nanoparticles spanning the gap between the electrodes , and @xmath23 is a prefactor around 0.2 - 0.5 that depends on dimensionality and array geometry .",
    "@xcite at @xmath24 , in this model there is no conductance for @xmath25 . above @xmath26 , the electrons percolate through the array via a multitude of branching paths that navigate local coulomb blockade thresholds and optimize the total charging energy cost .",
    "non - linear @xmath0 characteristics with a power law dependence on @xmath27 emerge as a consequence of the branching .",
    "@xcite    the semiclassical @xmath24 scenario for transport above a global coulomb threshold can be extended to finite temperatures .  @xcite",
    "as long as the charge disorder is sufficiently strong ( an assumption easily satisfied in nanoparticle arrays because @xmath16 is large ) , the main effect of temperature is to wash out differences between chemical potentials of neighboring particles and thus `` erase '' local coulomb blockade thresholds . as a consequence ,",
    "the global threshold @xmath26 decreases linearly with temperature , while the power law exponent in the @xmath0 characteristics remains unaffected .",
    "this picture is supported by experimental results on a variety of metal nanoparticle systems .",
    "@xcite specifically , for two - dimensional ( 2d ) close - packed au particle arrays it was found that @xmath28 where @xmath22 with @xmath29 and a temperature - independent exponent close to 2.2 .",
    "@xcite the weak , linear dependence of the global threshold on temperature is very robust and persists in the presence of structural disorder in the array . on the other hand",
    ", such disorder leads to @xmath0 characteristics that deviate from a simple power law above @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite    by design , the middleton and wingren model and its extensions only apply to the large bias limit and do not consider thermally activated charge excitations .",
    "the low - bias conductances across `` non - erased '' local thresholds are assumed to be exponentially suppressed and , as a result , the global low - bias conductance is effectively controlled by the largest threshold along the optimal path . because this path can avoid high charging energy costs to some extent by branching , for 2d close - packed arrays the relevant activation energy is not the full charging energy , but instead @xmath30 and which leads to a zero - bias conductance @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "@xcite this simplified picture neglects processes that involve charge transfer over distances larger than a single particle ( such as the cotunneling processes discussed next ) , but it is applicable at sufficiently high temperatures where the zero - bias conductance crosses over to simple activated , arrhenius behavior characteristic of nearest neighbor hopping .",
    "cotunneling , first discussed by averin and nazarov , is a tunneling process whereby electronic charge is transferred through several neighbor particles cooperatively  @xcite . for sequential",
    "tunneling each electron hop is a separate quantum event .",
    "by contrast , in cotunneling all charge transfers from the initial particle to the @xmath33 final particle occur via virtual states and thus count as a single quantum event  @xcite . in principle , there are two different types of cotunneling processes : elastic and inelastic . in elastic cotunneling ,",
    "an electron of the same eigenstate tunnels from the initial to the final particle , while inelastic cotunneling involves the cooperative motion of _ multiple _ electrons , tunneling from one particle to the nearest neighbor in concert .",
    "because elastic cotunneling becomes significant only at very low temperatures ( below @xmath34 1k in our system ) we will focus in the following on inelastic processes .    for the low - bias regime , the key quantity to consider for calculating the conductance",
    "is the probability to create an electron - hole excitation from an initially neutral particle .",
    "this probability is proportional to @xmath35 $ ] , where @xmath36 is the electro - static energy associated with the electron - hole pair .",
    "if charge transport occurs by sequential tunneling , the electron - hole pair is separated by one particle after the event and @xmath36 is simply @xmath16 . for cotunneling the final separation",
    "can be larger .",
    "if , at the end of an inelastic cotunneling process along a chain of neighboring particles , @xmath37 electrons have each moved one particle down the current path , the electron - hole pair is separated by @xmath38 particles , and @xmath39 . as a result , for @xmath40 cotunneling will always give rise to a larger zero - bias conductance than sequential tunneling ( even though cotunneling is a higher order process whose amplitude scales as @xmath41 , see below )  @xcite .    for the limit of zero applied bias , it was shown  @xcite that cotunneling events span a typical distance , @xmath42 . in terms of the number of tunnel junctions involved , this distance is given by @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the localization length ( @xmath45 for weakly coupled particles ) and @xmath46 the particle center - to - center spacing ( @xmath47 in our arrays ) .",
    "equating this distance with @xmath37 in the formula above for the activated creation of a dipole excitation leads to    @xmath48    for the zero - bias conductance , with a characteristic temperature @xmath49 given by @xmath50    where @xmath51 .",
    "@xcite this result has the same functional form for the temperature dependence as efros - shklovskii variable range hopping ( vrh ) for doped semiconductors .",
    "@xcite it similarly describes the effect of balancing net tunnel distance and energy cost .",
    "however , it arises here not from direct , single charge tunnel events between sparsely distributed atomic defect sites , but from cooperative multi - electron processes in dense arrays of metal particles .    at finite but small voltage , for inelastic cotunneling processes involving a distance of @xmath37 junctions , the current",
    "is given by @xmath52^j e^{\\frac { jev_{\\mathrm{jct}}-e}{k_bt } } \\left[\\frac{(ev_{\\mathrm{jct}})^2+(k_bt)^2}{e_c^2}\\right]^{j-1}.\\ ] ] here @xmath53 is the bias voltage drop across each of the @xmath37 junctions , @xmath5 and @xmath54 are the junction and quantum conductances respectively , and @xmath55 the energy cost for the dipole creation .",
    "for @xmath56 the conduction is ohmic and optimization with respect to @xmath37 returns the result for @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : g0 ] ) .",
    "if the current path involves sufficiently many particles in series , we expect that multiple cotunnel events will occur , each over a typical distance @xmath58 .",
    "this distance will increase according to @xmath59 as the temperature is reduced , leading to a corresponding increase in the curvature of the low - bias @xmath0 characteristics . on the other hand , if the length of the current path is fixed at a distance shorter than @xmath60 , the temperature dependence of the curvature will saturate .",
    "this paper explores these effects by performing transport measurements in metal nanoparticle arrays of different thicknesses in the direction perpendicular to the array plane .",
    "we compare these results with those of monolayers and tetralayers where current - voltage measurements were taken in - plane .",
    "dodecanethiol - ligated gold nanoparticles were synthesized by the digestive ripening method described in ref .",
    "this provided particle diameters around 5.5 nm with tight size control and dispersion less than @xmath61 in each batch .",

    "after particle deposition , a top electrode was evaporated over the array , consisting of a ni strip @xmath71 nm in thickness , 300@xmath72 in length and @xmath69 m in width .",
    "the top electrodes were shadow evaporated through masks made from the same @xmath62 window substrates used for the samples , with @xmath73 etched rectangular holes of dimension @xmath65 m @xmath74 m . by orienting the top electrodes orthogonal to the bottom electrodes in a cross - like geometry , overlapping regions of area @xmath69",

    "cr and ni were chosen as the electrode material because of their excellent adhesion to the @xmath62 as well as to the gold particles , and because uniform , continuous electrodes can be formed reliably at relatively low thickness .",
    "the use of ni kept the heat load on the array during evaporation lower than would have been the case with cr .",

    "the same argument might also explain why the in - plane monolayer exhibits a slightly larger @xmath49 than most other systems : it experiences less screening from additional layers above it .",
    "measurements were orthogonal to the sample plane .",
    "the inset shows arrhenius behavior in the monolayer with @xmath0 measurements performed in the lateral direction , and in the trilayer and tetralayer with @xmath0 measurements taken perpendicular to the sample plane .",

    "the two sets of data track each other well , differing by less than one junction over most of the measured temperature range .",
    "for example , at 10k , the distances determined based on @xmath49 are 4 junctions for both tri- and tetra - layers , while the power - law exponents give 2.5 and 3 junctions , respectively .    at sufficiently high temperatures , the cotunnel distance approaches a single junction . at this point @xmath57",

    "[ fig : g0 t ] gives a cross - over temperature @xmath124 and @xmath125k .",
    "similar cross - overs at temperatures around 70 - 100k were observed in our previous previous data for the in - plane zero - bias conductance of bi- , tri , and tetralayers .",
    "@xcite from the expression  @xcite @xmath126 that relates the measured high - temperature , arrhenius - type activation energy @xmath127 to the charging energy we find @xmath128 values of 965k , 1140k and 1500k for the tri- , tetra- , and monolayer in fig .",

    "large magnetic fields squeeze the exponentially - decaying wavefunctions in the transverse direction , i.e. if the applied magnetic field is along the out - of - plane or z - direction , the wavefunctions are squeezed in the x- and y - directions .",
    "the decrease in the wavefunction overlap gives rise to a decreased tunneling amplitude , and this in turn produces a decrease in the variable - range - hopping conductance  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon has been observed in both n - type  @xcite and p - type semiconductors  @xcite .",
    "recent magneto - transport data on n - type cdse semiconductor nanoparticle films has also been interpreted within the vrh picture  @xcite . by investigating the magnetic field dependence of our metal nanoparticle arrays ,",
    "we therefore can provide a further test for the transport mechanism : vrh is expected to produce a positive magnetoresistance , while inelastic cotunneling should not be affected even by large magnetic fields since the hops of all participating electrons involve only nearest neighbors .",
    "figure  [ fig : magneto ] shows that the presence of a magnetic field perpendicular to the sample plane has no clear measurable effect within our experimental resolution .",
    "these data were taken for in - plane transport through a monolayer and for vertical transport through a bilayer .",
    "the same behavior was observed when magnetic fields were applied along the direction of the sample plane .",
    "this magnetic - field - independent of the @xmath0 characteristics is to be compared to the large positive magnetoresistance ( @xmath129 at 10 t and @xmath130k ) reported for cdse films .",
    "@xcite the distance over which an applied magnetic field @xmath131 affects charge motion is set by the magnetic length @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the flux quantum .",
    "since @xmath134 nm at fields @xmath135 t the absence of magnetoresistance in the weakly coupled metal nanoparticle arrays discussed here implies that the motion of individual charges occurs over distances less than @xmath136 , in line with inelastic cotunneling . at sufficiently low temperatures where a cross - over to elastic cotunneling takes place",
    ", magnetoresistance should reappear . in our samples , this cross - over is expected below  1k , and it may be possible that this produced the slight differences between the traces with and without magnetic field in fig .  [",
    "fig : magneto]a .",
    "however , we believe that the data are too close to the experimental noise floor .",
    "the results presented here demonstrate that the electronic transport of weakly - coupled metal nanoparticle arrays is well described by a picture based on sequential tunneling in the high - bias regime above a global coulomb blockade threshold , and by inelastic cotunneling in the low - bias regime below that threshold . in particular , multiple inelastic cotunneling provides an explanation for both the exponential , inverse - square - root temperature dependence of the conductance , @xmath57 , in the limit of zero bias and the non - linear , power law @xmath0 characteristics observed inside the coulomb - blockade regime at finite bias . while the zero - bias temperature dependence of @xmath57 mimics that known from single - charge , variable - range hopping transport in doped semiconductors , cotunneling events are cooperative , multi - electron processes . in close - packed metal particle arrays",
    "individual electrons are unlikely to move further than to their nearest neighbor , at least at temperatures above  1k , in contrast to hopping between sparse doping sites .",
    "comparison of transport measurements taken in - plane and perpendicular to the arrays ( figs .  [",
    "fig : ivs_verticaltransport ] and  [ fig : ivs_inplane ] ) indicate that typical cotunnel events in au nanoparticle arrays involve up to 4 electrons ( and thus reach net distances corresponding to 4 tunnel junctions in a row ) at 10k ( fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] ) .",
    "the absence of clean evidence for magnetoresistive effects up to the highest applied magnetic fields ( 10 t ) further supports the picture of inelastic cotunneling as the mechanism for charge transport inside the coulomb blockade regime .",
