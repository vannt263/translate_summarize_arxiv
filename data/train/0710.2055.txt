    "neutrino oscillations are firmly established ( see , e.g. @xcite ) and demonstrate that neutrinos have masses many orders of magnitude smaller than those of charged leptons .",
    "but since the masses are nonzero , neutrinoless double - beta ( @xmath0 ) decay experiments will likely tell us sooner or later whether neutrinos are majorana or dirac particles @xcite .",
    "moreover , the rate of the @xmath0 decay , or limits on it , can tell us about the absolute neutrino - mass scale and to some extent about the neutrino mass hierarchy decay search . ] . but to achieve these goals we need an accurate evaluation of the nuclear matrix elements that govern the decay .    in this paper , which builds on previous publications @xcite ( which we call i and ii )",
    ", we analyze some of the physics affecting the nuclear matrix element @xmath1  the competition between pairing and neutron - proton particle - particle correlations , the nonintuitive dependence of the decay amplitude on internucleon distance , and the treatment of short - range correlations and other high - momentum phenomena  that have not been sufficiently discussed before . as in our earlier papers ( and most attempts to evaluate @xmath1 )",
    "we use the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) and its generalization , the renormalized qrpa ( rqrpa ) , with an interaction obtained from the g matrix associated with the realistic bonn cd nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "that interaction , slightly renormalized , is used both as the like particle pairing and as the neutron - proton force . where appropriate",
    ", we compare the results to those of the complementary large - scale shell model ( lssm ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section , after briefly summarizing the relevant formalism , we show that the final value of @xmath1 reflects two competing forces : the like particle pairing interaction that leads to the smearing of fermi levels and the residual neutron - proton interaction that , through ground state correlations , admixes  broken - pair \" ( higher - seniority ) states .",
    "a partial cancellation between these interactions increases the sensitivity to their strengths .",
    "the same tendencies are present in the lssm , as a recent paper shows @xcite .",
    "( during the processing of this manuscript , a new paper on the lssm appeared @xcite , emphasizing the competition again . ) in section iii we discuss the dependence of @xmath1 on the distance between the two neutrons that are converted into two protons .",
    "we show that the competition mentioned above implies that only internucleon distances @xmath2 2 - 3 fm contribute .",
    "that fact , not recognized before , explains the sensitivity of the decay rate to higher order terms in nucleon currents , nucleon form factors , and short - range nucleon - nucleon repulsion .",
    "we show that the surprising dependence on the internucleon distance occurs not only in the qrpa but also in an exactly solvable model @xcite that contains many ingredients of real nuclear systems .",
    "short - range correlations have recently inspired a lively discussion @xcite and we devote section iv to various ways of treating them . in section",

    "section vi summarizes our findings .",
    "finally , in appendix a we present formulae for two ways of evaluating the matrix elements , one via the evaluation of unsymmetrized two - body matrix elements ( the procedure usually used ) and another one through the product of two one - body matrix elements . and",
    "in appendix b we show how to calculate shell - model particle - hole decompositions so they can be compared with those calculated in the qrpa .",
    "throughout we assume that the @xmath0 decay , if observed , is caused by the exchange of the majorana neutrinos , the same particles observed to oscillate .",
    "the half - life of the decay is then @xmath3 is a precisely calculable phase - space factor and @xmath4 is the nuclear matrix element . the effective majorana neutrino mass @xmath5 is related to the absolute mass scale and oscillation parameters through @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the first row of the neutrino mixing matrix and the and @xmath8 are unknown majorana phases .",

    "( some of the difference might be due to differences in single - particle energies and occupation numbers , which are not identical in the two calculations even though the single - particle wave functions are . )",
    "the reason that the qrpa results presented in section v are larger are a somewhat greater pairing contribution and contributions from negative parity multipoles that reinforce it .",
    "most of the negative - parity contributions are absent from the shell model because of restrictions on the model space .",

    "@xmath1 can then be rewritten purely in terms of the antisymmetrized two - body matrix elements .",
