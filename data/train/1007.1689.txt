    "<S> from the viewpoint of classical electrodynamics , we identify the role of spin - to - orbital angular momentum conversion in spin hall effect ( she ) of light . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a distinct separation between spin and orbital angular momenta to clarify the spin - orbital interaction in conventional beam refraction . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the refractive index gradient can enhance or suppress the spin - to - orbital angular momentum conversion , and thus can control the she of light . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the metamaterial whose refractive index can be tailored arbitrarily may become a good candidate for amplifying or eliminating the she of light , and by properly facilitating the spin - to - orbital angular momentum conversion the she may be enhanced dramatically . the transverse spatial shifts governed by the spin - to - orbital angular momentum conversion , provide us a clear physical picture to clarify the role of refractive index gradient in the she of light . </S>",
    "<S> these findings provide a pathway for modulating the she of light and can be extrapolated to other physical systems . </S>"
