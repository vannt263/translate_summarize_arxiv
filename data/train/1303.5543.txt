    "in 2009 , a new type of building block - kinked silicon nanowire ( ksinw ) - was synthesized by tian _",

    "the growth direction of the ksinw changes from @xmath0 to @xmath1 to @xmath0 at the kink .",
    "particularly , the researchers are able to manipulate the arm length of the kink by controlling the growth time .",
    "great experimental efforts have been devoted to investigating the growth mechanism of the kinks in silicon nanowires since then@xcite . besides these experimental works , schwarz and tersoff have proposed a theoretical model to interpret the growth mechanism of the ksinw . in their model",
    ", the kink formation is due to the interplay of three basic processes : facet growth , droplet statics , and the introduction of new facets@xcite .",
    "stimulated by ksinws , several groups have synthesized kinks in other nanowires , such as @xmath2 multikinked nanowires@xcite , kinked germanium nanowires@xcite , germanium  silicon axial heterostructure with kinks@xcite , and kinked zno nanowires@xcite . while existing works for ksinw mainly concentrate on its growth mechanism , the study of elastic properties like young s modulus is also important for its application in nanomechanical devices .",

    "_ have shown that the young s modulus in bulk silicon along @xmath3 direction is about @xmath4 higher than that in the @xmath5 lattice direction.@xcite in nano materials , due to large surface to volume ratio , the size effect@xcite and nanodefects@xcite have been found to be important for the mechanical properties such as the young s modulus .",
    "for example , the afm - measured young s modulus ranged from 93 to 250 gpa depending on the nanowire diameter.@xcite    in this paper , we apply both molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations and finite element method to study the size - dependence of the young s modulus in the ksinw . we find that the young s modulus is sensitive to its arm length ; specifically , it decreases fast with increasing arm length . the underlying mechanism for this size - dependence is disclosed to be the competition between kink angle potential and the arm length potential .",

    "this lattice constraint will have direct result on the configuration of the kink .",
    "in the experiment , the diameter @xmath16 is pre - defined during the growth of the ksinw@xcite , which will likely deviate from the above discrete values . in ksinw samples with diameter down to a few nanometers , the lattice constraint will play a more important role .",
    "panel ( c ) shows four unit cells of a ksinw with 1.54  nm in diameter and 2.66  nm in arm length , i.e @xmath17 .",
    "the unit cell is highlighted by a rectangular box .",
    "in our md simulation , the interaction between si atoms is modeled by the widely used stillinger - weber empirical potential@xcite .",
    "the structure of the ksinw is first relaxed without applying strain , yielding the minimum total energy @xmath18 . after applying strain @xmath19 to the system ,",
    "the tensile structure is optimized with left and right ends fixed , which results in a total energy @xmath20 .",

    "only one unit cell is considered here , and we found that the young s modulus does not depend on the number of unit cells in the ksinw .",
    "the young s modulus decreases with increasing arm length and can be fitted to an analytic function ( solid lines ) @xmath24 which can be well explained by the valence force field model as will be shown later .",
    "the two coefficients @xmath25 are ( 216.5 , 0.23 ) , ( 591.1 , 1.45 ) , and ( 881.7 , 2.12 ) for these three sets of ksinws .",
    "it shows that the young s modulus can be very small for ksinw with very long arm length .",
    "this prediction can be readily verified experimentally , considering the arm length of ksinw samples can be successfully controlled in the laboratory@xcite .",

    "[ fig_young ] shows the diameter dependence for the young s modulus in ksinws with arm length 13.3  nm .",
    "the young s modulus increases exponentially and saturates to a constant value of 151.0  gpa .",
    "similar diameter dependence was observed in straight silicon nanowires.@xcite using the stillinger - weber potential , we have calculated the young s modulus in a bulk silicon to be 159.0  gpa in @xmath3 direction and 132.0  gpa in @xmath26 direction .",
    "both values fall in the experimental range of the young s modulus in bulk silicon.@xcite the saturation value of 151.0  gpa in large diameter limit is sandwiched between the young s modulus in bulk silicon along @xmath3 and @xmath26 directions .",
    "this result can be understood from the fact that the ksinw is constructed by @xmath3 ( the arm ) and @xmath26 ( the kink ) silicon nanowires .",
    "we also calculate the young s modulus of ksinws from the continuum theory based on the finite element method .",

    "finite element calculations are performed using the commercial ansys 12.0 package with 2-node beam188 element .",

    "[ fig_beam ] shows the von mises stress distribution from the elastic beam model for two ksinws with arm length 13.30  nm and diameter 1.54  nm in ( a ) , and arm length 26.60  nm and diameter 1.54  nm in ( b ) .",
    "the applied tensile displacements are the same in both structures .",
    "the stress in the thinner ksinw in ( b ) is roughly one quarter of that in the ksinw in ( a ) , because the young s modulus and the strain in the thinner ksinw in ( b ) are both about half of that in the ksinw in ( a ) .",
    "we note that the euler - bernoulli beam model neglects the shear strain , while this shear strain is considered in the timoshenko beam model .",
    "we have also tested the timoshenko beam model , and a similar size dependence of the young s modulus is obtained while the value is overall smaller . an interesting phenomenon in fig .",
    "[ fig_beam ] is the distinct stress concentration at kinks .",
    "the stress concentration may lead to the generation of a fracture around the kink in the ksinw under large tension .",
    "this stress concentration phenomenon also affects the accuracy of the predicted young s modulus .",
    "an important parameter in such calculation is the stress concentration ratio ( sct ) , i.e the ratio of the stress concentration length to the total length .",
    "the sct is less than 30% in both ksinws shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_beam ] .",
    "this is important .",
    "it is because the saint - venant principle says that it is crucial for the sct to be less than 30% for an accurate prediction of the young s modulus.@xcite according to the saint - venant principle,@xcite a more accurate young s modulus can be obtained from a smaller sct , because the stress is distributed uniformly in more areas within the system in case of smaller sct . from the comparison of these two ksinws in fig .",
    "[ fig_beam ] , the sct decreases with increasing arm length . as a result , the young s modulus from the finite element method should be more accurate for ksinws of longer arm length . indeed , fig .",
    "[ fig_young ] shows a better agreement between the young s modulus from the finite element method and the molecular mechanics approach for ksinws of longer arm length .",
    "results for the set of ksinws of diameter 1.54  nm are shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig_young ] .",
    "the overall tendency from the finite element calculation agrees well with the md simulation results .",
    "the young s modulus decreases with increasing arm length .",
    "it should be noted that the finite element results always lie bellow the md simulation results , which may probably due to the lose of part of the angle bending interactions in the beam model and also surface effects . as a result",
    ", the beam model actually mimics a system that is softer than the real material .",
    "the softness property of the beam model has been discussed in more detail in a recent work by zhao _",
    "et.al_.@xcite the deviation between the finite element results and the md simulations is more pronounced for ksinws with smaller arm length , as the euler - bernoulli beam model is more accurate for a thinner rod structure with higher length to diameter ratio .",
    "there will be some systematic errors in the euler - bernoulli beam model if the simulated is very thick and/or short , since the higher order terms associated with the shearing deformation are ignored in this model .",
    "the surface induced diameter dependence of the young s modulus from the finite element method is also shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig_young ] .",
    "again , the general tendency from finite element method agrees with that from the md simulation , and the elastic method also gives a lower value for the young s modulus .",
    "the above size - dependence for the axial young s modulus can be understood in a valence force field model .",
    "considering its zigzag configuration , the ksinw can be simplified by a series of springs representing its arm length and kink angle as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_cfg_kink ] .",
    "the arm - spring has a force constant of @xmath27 , while the kink - spring has a force constant of @xmath28 .",
    "the potential of these two springs give the most important interaction for such a zigzag structure . due to the translation invariance",
    ", we only need to consider the interaction within a single kink in the ksinw .",
    "the kink angle bending ( @xmath29 ) and the arm length stretching ( @xmath30 ) potentials are@xcite , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the kink angle and @xmath33 is the arm length .",
    "variables with subscript 0 correspond to their values at equilibrium configuration without strain . for uniaxial strain applied in the horizontal direction , fig .",
    "[ fig_cfg_kink ] shows a relationship among geometrical variables @xmath34 there is only one independent degree of freedom in the tensile ksinw .",

    "( [ eq_emc ] ) yields the equilibrium structure of the ksinw under mechanical strain @xmath19 . for small strain ,",
    "the kink angle is also small , so it only slightly deviates from its equilibrium value , i.e @xmath37 .",
    "applying standard perturbation theory to eq .",
    "( [ eq_emc ] ) up to @xmath38 , we get @xmath39 where the three coefficients are : @xmath40,\\\\ \\gamma = k_{b}c\\left(\\frac{1}{2}c-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}b_{0}\\right ) . \\end{array } \\right . \\label{eq_coefficient}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the solution of the equilibrium equation is then obtained analytically , @xmath41    it can be shown that the elastic properties are dominated by the first - order term in the taylor expansion of the angle variation @xmath42 in terms of @xmath19 .",

    "( [ eq_coefficient ] ) to the taylor series of @xmath19 : @xmath43 where @xmath44 inserting these equilibrium coefficients into eq .",
    "( [ eq_solution ] ) , we obtain the angle variation without strain : @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "obviously , only @xmath47 is the physical solution , because the angle variation should vanish without strain .",
    "for the first - order term , we have @xmath48 the angle variation is : @xmath49 where @xmath50 . according to this formula",
    ", the kink angle variation is determined by the competition between kink angle and arm length potentials .",
    "it is smaller for ksinw with larger @xmath28 , or smaller @xmath27 , which is physically correct . a rigid arm ( @xmath51 )",
    "results in the largest angle variation of @xmath52 .    inserting the kink angle variation into the total strain energy in eq .",

    "[ fig_young ] .",
    "this coincide verifies the spring representation of the ksinw .",
    "we note that the deviation between md simulations and the valence force field model in the figure for longer arm length is probably due to nonlinear effects resulting from larger kink angle variation for longer arm length , which is omitted in our derivation . from the above analytic derivation , it is clear that the young s modulus is determined by the competition between the kink angle bending potential and the arm length stretching potential , corresponding to the two terms in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq_young ] ) . for ksinw with @xmath58 ,",
    "the young s modulus increases with increasing arm length ; while the opposite phenomenon should be observed in ksinw with @xmath58 .",
    "our md simulation results in fig .  [ fig_young ] show that these ksinw in our study fall in the latter case .",
    "the size - dependence of the young s modulus is governed by the coefficient @xmath59 , which is determined by the ratio of the two force constants @xmath28 and @xmath27 .",
    "hence , our analytic formula provides valuable information for tuning the behavior of the young s modulus by using various materials with different @xmath28 or @xmath27 .",
    "it is interesting that @xmath59 is independent of the diameter of the ksinw , so the decreasing behavior of the young s modulus is diameter independent , which is indeed observed in the md simulation results .    using the fitting parameters @xmath25 from our md simulations , we can extract the two force constants @xmath60 to be ( 103.8 , 265.3 ) , ( 179.8 , 2897.3 ) , and ( 412.8 , 9723.9 ) for ksinws with diameters 1.54 , 3.07 , and 4.61  nm , respectively .",

    "both force constants @xmath27 and @xmath28 are independent of the arm length , but increase rapidly with increasing diameter .",
    "these two force constants are effective values for the whole ksinw system , so it can be quite different from the force constants in the potential for an actual chemical bond .",
    "for instance , @xmath28 for ksinws with diameter 1.54  nm is about 20 times larger than that describing c - c - c angles in carbon nanotubes@xcite , while @xmath27 is half of that in the c - c bonds in carbon nanotubes@xcite . from the energy point of view",
    ", each silicon atom in the system is connected to its neighbors by small springs within the linear approximation . @xmath27 and @xmath28 are actually the summation over these small springs between silicon atom pairs .",
    "for ksinw with larger diameter , there are more small springs that are in parallel connection , so the two effective force constants @xmath27 and @xmath28 are larger . for ksinw with longer arm length",
