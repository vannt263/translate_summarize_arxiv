    "this means that we will only consider radiation of wavelengths @xmath4 , which is always the case in optical experiments . in this case , the qed effects can be described by the euler - heisenberg effective lagrangian density@xcite ,    @xmath5    being @xmath6 the linear lagrangian density and @xmath7 and @xmath8 the dielectric constant and the speed of light in vacuum , respectively . here ,",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 are the expectation values of the electromagnetic fields , that can be measured by the usual classical means e.g. using test charges .",
    "the additional , nonlinear terms , that appear multiplying the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 in eq . , are the only two lorentz - covariant terms that can be formed with the electromagnetic fields at the lowest order above @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , they appear as the first correction to the linear evolution in qed in all the alternative theories , such as the born - infeld theories @xcite . in qed ,",
    "@xmath14 , being @xmath15    this quantity has dimensions of the inverse of an energy density .",
    "this means that significant changes with respect to linear propagation can be expected when the electromagnetic energy density is such that @xmath16 is not very small .",
    "while such intensities may have an astrophysical or cosmological importance , they are not achievable in the laboratory , as we shall discuss in the next section .",
    "once the electromagnetic fields are expressed in terms of the four - component gauge field @xmath17 as @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the equations of motion are given by the variational principle :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the qed effective action . instead of studying the resulting equations for the fields @xmath22 and @xmath10 , that can be found in the literature@xcite , it is more convenient to consider the equations for the gauge field components @xmath23 . as we discussed in ref .",

    "( [ non_lin_polarized ] ) .",
    "however , we expect that the non - linear terms proportional to @xmath39 , due to the qed correction , will spoil the superposition principle .",
    "as we shall see , this will imply a change in the propagation of crossing waves . on the other hand",
    ", no nonlinear effect appears for a parallel beam .",
    "of course , this nonlinearity is not a problem for the communication system : it can easily be seen that this vacuum effect is much smaller than that of the atmosphere .",
    "in fact , the non trivial question is the opposite : how can we detect such a nonlinearity ? in order to have a significant effect , we need very high fields to compensate @xmath40 . which is the maximum electromagnetic energy density that can be achieved ?",
    "ultra intense photon sources are available thanks to the discovery of chirped pulse amplification ( cpa)@xcite in the late 80 s and optical parametric chirped pulse amplification ( opcpa ) @xcite in the 90 s .",
    "very recently , the hercules laser @xcite reached a peak intensity @xmath41 , corresponding to a value @xmath42 for the product giving the importance of the nonlinear qed effects . in few years",
    ", the projected european extreme light infrastructure ( eli ) @xcite will achieve @xmath43 , or @xmath44 .",
    "finally , for a more distant future there is the hope to achieve @xmath45 @xcite , or @xmath46 .",
    "these are the highest values for the intensities of the electromagnetic field that are available ( hercules ) or will be available in the future .",

( in that case , @xmath51 , so that the energy per pulse will still be reasonably small @xmath52 . )    of course , these facilities have very important technological and scientific applications .",
    "first , it has been proved that they can be used to produce beams of high energy charged particles after bombarding a plasma @xcite .",
    "this effect is highly nonlinear , since it can produce kinetic energies of the order of the @xmath1s or even the @xmath53s ( and possibly even higher ) using the @xmath54 photons of the laser bumps @xcite .",
    "this will provide cheap and reliable sources of radiation for cancer therapy and medical diagnostics , and may also help to ignite nuclear fusion .",
    "moreover , it can be hoped that this surprising new form of accelerating particles can lead to a new era in particle physics .",
    "a second class of applications uses the small duration of the pulses , that will allow for an ultrashort time microscopy , which can be very important e.g. in nanotechnology .    finally , as we shall see below , these ultrahigh power lasers will provide a very promising tool for the exploration of the nonlinearity of the vacuum , and in particular for the search of @xmath0 scattering .",
    "we have seen that the qed radiative corrections imply a nonlinear wave equations for the vector potential @xmath23 . on the other hand , the modified maxwell s equations for the average values of the electromagnetic quantum fields @xmath22 and @xmath10",
    "were obtained long ago @xcite , and they were used to show that the qed vacuum exhibits the dc kerr effect , implying birefringence @xcite .",
    "more recently , several works have proposed different configurations that can actually be used for experimental tests of the nonlinear optical response of the vacuum , e.g. using harmonic generation in an inhomogeneous magnetic field@xcite , qed four - wave mixing@xcite , resonant interactions in microwave cavities@xcite , or laser - induced qed vacuum birefringence@xcite which can be probed by x - ray pulses@xcite , among others@xcite .",
    "all these proposals are very interesting and all of them deserve to be explored",
    ". they will provide different , independent tests for photon - photon scattering . however , all these cases will need some technological advance .",
    "for instance , x - ray probing of qed birefringence requires an extra free electron laser , which is not yet available .",
    "other techniques like four - wave mixing processes@xcite require the crossing of at least three beams , with the corresponding alignment problems .",
    "as we shall see in the next section , our proposal is considerably simpler than the previous ones , and it only requires a ultrahigh energy pulse .    here , we would like to mention a very recent result obtained by the pvlas collaboration @xcite that has searched for an evidence of birefringence of the vacuum in a _",
    "magnetic _ field background @xcite . their _ negative _ result has been used to set the _ current limit _ on the cross section for @xmath0 scattering at optical wavelengths . assuming the qed effective lagrangian , but treating @xmath39 as a free phenomenological parameter",
    ", their results can be translated in the limit @xmath55 .",
    "we see that this constraint is @xmath56 times higher than the qed value .",
    "note that in ref .",
    "@xcite this result was also stated as a limit on the photon - photon cross section , @xmath57 , for @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , for @xmath60 .",

( [ non_lin_polarized ] ) ) would be    @xmath63\\\\ \\nonumber & = & { \\cal a}\\cos(\\omega t)\\cos(k z ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath36 is a constant amplitude , @xmath64 is the wave vector , and @xmath65 is the angular frequency .",
    "it is easy to see that eq .",
    "( [ counterprop_lin ] ) can also be considered as the analytical solution of the linear wave equation satisfying the boundary conditions    @xmath66    where for convenience we chose as the integration interval a ` small ' cuboid of time - dimension @xmath67 and space - dimension @xmath68 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have found the solution of the nonlinear eq .",
    "( [ non_lin_polarized ] ) that satisfies the same boundary conditions of eq .",

    ", we will use realistic values of @xmath72 when we will present our proposals of experiments in the last sections . for the moment , it is interesting to note that even such an enormous energy density is still small enough so that the effect of the nonlinear terms gives a small correction to the linear evolution in the short distance .",
    "in fact , we see from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] that the relative difference between the linear and the nonlinear evolution , in our integration interval which is of the order of the wavelength , is of the order of few percent , i.e. of the same order than the adimensional parameter @xmath69 .",
    "this result is not surprising , and will provide a justification for the perturbatively - motivated variational approach that we will use in the next sections .",
    "however , from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] itself , we can also appreciate that the difference between the linear and nonlinear behavior tends to increase along the @xmath61 evolution , so that it can be expected that it will eventually become large after a distance much larger than the wavelength . in the next section , we will see an analytical argument that confirms this expectation .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we compare the @xmath61-evolution of the solutions @xmath73 and @xmath74 in a greater detail for values of @xmath61 around the second zero of the solutions .",
    "we see that @xmath73 anticipates @xmath74 , and the corresponding phase shift can be evaluated numerically if we define an effective wave vector component @xmath75 by computing the value @xmath76 corresponding to @xmath77 , and setting @xmath78 . the numerical determination of the zero gives @xmath79 , so that @xmath80 .",
    "we will provide a full explanation for this result in the following section .",
    "although it can be considered as an interesting achievement due to its simplicity and lack of previous approximations , in practice the numerical solution that has been discussed above can only be obtained in the special configuration of two counter - propagating , in - phase waves , and for short propagation ( of the order of the wavelength ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have found a variational approximation that can be used to provide an _ analytical _ solution which is valid even for a long evolution . in particular , we have considered the same two counterpropagating waves as in the previous section , that would be described by eq .",
    "( [ counterprop_lin ] ) in the linear case .",
    "note that any of the two crossing waves , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , when taken alone , would be a solution of both the linear and non - linear equations , provided that @xmath65 .",
    "however , their superposition would only solve the linear equations of motion .",
    "taking into account the smallness of the product @xmath16 , and using the variational method , we have found the following analytical approximation    @xmath83 , \\label{varsolution1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath84 is a parameter that describes the leading nonlinear effects .    as a result",
    ", we find that after a distance @xmath85 the phase of the wave is shifted by a term    @xmath86    note also that the result of eq .",
    "( [ varsolution1 ] ) can be stated equivalently by defining a wave vector as @xmath87 , that satisfies a modified dispersion relation , @xmath88 .    in qed ( @xmath89 ) , for the same choice of parameters that was considered in the previous section , @xmath90 , in agreement with the numerical simulation . in this case",
    ", we get @xmath91 , which is two order of magnitude smaller than @xmath92 .",
    "our approximations can then be expected to be reasonably good even for the extremely large of @xmath72 that we have chosen here .",
    "note also that this corresponds to a value @xmath93 , in agreement with the result that we obtained from the numerical simulation in the previous section .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we compare the corresponding analytical solution @xmath94 , given in eq .",
    "( [ varsolution1 ] ) , with the numerical solution @xmath73 of the qed wave equations that we have found in the previous section . comparing with fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we see that the variational solution is an order of magnitude closer to the numerical simulation than the linear evolution , eq .",
    "( [ counterprop_lin ] ) , that was obtained by completely neglecting the nonlinear terms .",
    "this is a significant improvement in such a short distance .",
    "however , according to the previous discussion , in the perturbative regime corresponding to small values of the product @xmath95 , the variational solution is expected to be a good approximation even when a longer propagation distance is considered along the @xmath61-axis .    on the other hand",
    ", the agreement of the variational solution with the numerical simulation can be used as an additional , _ a posteriori _",
    "justification for our analytical approach .",
    "therefore , in ref .",
    "@xcite we have applied the variational method to different configurations , that do not allow for a direct integration of the full eq .",
    "( [ non_lin_polarized ] ) .",
    "the most promising one is the case of the scattering of a relatively low power wave with a counterpropagating high power wave , both traveling along the @xmath61 axis .",
    "we have also allowed for an arbitrary initial phase difference between the two waves , assuming for simplicity that two waves have the same frequency . in this case",
    ", the main effect will be the modification of the low power beam due to the crossing with the high power one , which would be unaffected in a first approximation .",
    "using our variational approach , we have found that the low power wave is modified , as compared to the linear behavior , as described by the following approximated analytical solution    @xmath96 , \\label{a_l_sol}\\ ] ]    where @xmath97 , and @xmath72 is the ( average ) energy density of the high power wave .",
    "therefore , after a distance @xmath85 the low power beam accumulates a phase shift    @xmath98    we stress that this result only depends on the energy density of the high power wave , as far as it much larger than that of the low power wave .",
    "the initial phase difference is found to be irrelevant .",
    "@xcite , we have proposed an experimental setup which can provide the simplest and most sensitive approach for the optical search of photon - photon scattering in vacuum .",
    "we have also showed that this porposal can be used at future exawatt facilities such as eli @xcite to detect the qed effect . here",
    ", we will briefly review that idea , and show that it can also be used at _ present _ high power laser facilities , such as hercules @xcite , to search for non - qed effects , or to improve the current limit for photon - photon scattering .",
    "the proposed experiment can be described as follows .",
    "a common laser pulse is divided in two beams , a and b , one of which ( say a ) crosses at a @xmath99 a very high power beam . as a result ,",
    "the central part of the distribution of the beam a has acquired a phase shift @xmath100 with respect to beam b , that has propagated freely .    in an experiment corresponding to the parameters of the eli project in its first step we have pulses of wavelength @xmath101 , intensity @xmath102 and duration @xmath103 which are focused in a spot of diameter @xmath104 . from eq .",
    "( [ phaseshift_lh ] ) , using for @xmath11 the qed value of @xmath39 as given in eq .",
    ", this results in a phase shift @xmath105 for beam a , which can be resolved comparing with the beam b which was not exposed to the effects of qed vacuum . current techniques like",
    "spectrally resolved two - beam coupling , which can be applied for ultrashort pulses@xcite , can be used to this purpose , being sensible to phase shifts as small as @xmath106 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the sensitivity of this method for the detection of photon - photon scattering may be enhanced by a suitable choice of the combination of the intensity @xmath107 , the wavelength @xmath108 and the time duration @xmath109 that enter in eq .",
    "( [ phaseshift_lh ] ) .",
    "in fact , taking into account that @xmath110 , eq .",
    "( [ phaseshift_lh ] ) implies that the most sensitive experimental configuration will be that having the maximum value of the combination @xmath111",
    ".    moreover , in an experiment corresponding to the parameters of the hercules laser @xcite , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , the same configuration as above would give @xmath116 ( from qed ) , which is possibly beyond the possibility of detection using current techniques .",
    "however , the experiment could find evidences of non - qed @xmath0 scattering , or , if the result is negative , it can be used to substantially improve the current limit .",
    "assuming as in ref .",
    "@xcite the same form of the effective lagrangian than in qed , and taking @xmath106 as the sensitivity in the phase shift measurement , we see that hercules can prove values of the @xmath11 parameter down to the value @xmath117 , which is almost two orders of magnitude lower than pvlas current limit .",
    "since the scattering cross section depends quadratically on @xmath39 , hercules can improve the current limit on @xmath118 by a factor @xmath119 .",
    "this sensitivity may be increased by the upgrades of hercules that are programmed for the next months .",
    "again , the most sensitive configuration will be that maximizing the product @xmath111 .",
    "finally , it could be interesting to study the possibility of further enhancing the sensitivity of our proposed experiment by focalizing the high power pulse in the center of a cavity , keeping the intensity on the mirrors below the damage threshold .",
    "in this case , the high and low power pulse might be synchronized to cross each other several times .",
    "the number of times they meet would then multiply the value of the phase shift .",
    "we have reviewed our recent proposal @xcite of a very simple experiment for the search of photon - photon scattering in vacuum . in this proposal , a low power laser pulse is made to cross with an ultrahigh power laser bump .",
    "@xmath0 scattering will then be tested by measuring the phase shift of the low power laser beam , e.g. by comparing with a third low power laser beam . even in the first step of eli ,",
    "we have found @xcite that the resulting phase shift due to the qed - induced @xmath0 scattering will be at least @xmath105 , which can be measured with present technology .",
    "moreover , in the present work we have also discussed the possibility of performing our proposed experiment at present ultrahigh power laser facilities , such as hercules . in particular , we have shown that hercules is already able either to detect @xmath0 scattering , or to improve the current limit on the cross section @xmath118 at optical wavelengths by more than three orders of magnitude ."
