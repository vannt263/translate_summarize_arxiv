    "the highest values of @xmath0 tend to produce vesicle rupture during the adhesion process  @xcite , owing to a strong tension induced in the membrane  @xcite .    to determine the shape and free energy of an adhering vesicle",
    ", one must take into account the competition between : i ) the adhesion energy gain , ii ) the constraints on the total membrane area  @xmath5 and the total enclosed volume  @xmath6 , and iii ) the free energy cost associated with the curvature elasticity of the membrane .",

    "we determine analytically the first - order corrections to various physical observables and we discuss their limit of validity by a direct comparison with exact numerical results .    the first - order corrections with respect to the infinite adhesion limit originate from the existence of a strongly curved region at the border of the adhesion disc ( see fig .",

    "[ ordre1lim ] , we determine _ numerically _ the global observables and we discuss the range of validity of the corresponding first - order expansions . finally , in sec .",

    "in most experimental situations , although vesicles are slightly permeable to water , their volume  @xmath6 is strongly fixed by the osmotic pressure of the various solubilized ions to which the membrane is impermeable  @xcite .",
    "we shall suppose that this volume constraint remains satisfied for adhering vesicles .",
    "the area  @xmath5 of vesicles is also fixed to a high accuracy : solubilized lipids are almost inexistent and the area - stretching modulus  @xmath16 , which is of the order of @xmath17mj / m@xmath18 , can not significantly affect the area constraint  @xcite . it is traditional to introduce a dimensionless parameter  @xmath19 , the reduced volume , defined by @xmath20 this quantity @xmath21 describes how much the vesicle is deflated with respect to a sphere ( @xmath22 ) . due to the constraints , it is fixed .",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath5 being fixed , the free energy of an adhering vesicle is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the two local principal curvatures of the membrane , @xmath7 is the helfrich bending constant  @xcite , @xmath26 is the area of contact between the vesicle and the substrate , and @xmath0 is the contact potential . as discussed in the introduction , we simply model the adhesion by an energy proportional to the contact area . in principle",
    ", @xmath27 should also contain a gaussian curvature term @xmath28 , however we discard it since its integral over the membrane is constant for a given vesicle topology , according to the gauss - bonnet theorem  @xcite .",
    "therefore , there are only two dimensionless parameters in the problem : @xmath19 and @xmath29 .    in the whole paper",
    ", we shall restrict ourselves to axisymmetric vesicle shapes .",
    "we define the following global observables ( see fig .  [ schema_general ] ) : we call @xmath30 the height of the vesicle measured on the revolution axis , and @xmath31 the radius of the adhesion disc .",
    "the adhering area is thus @xmath32 . in the regime of strong adhesion , vesicles almost take the shape of a spherical cap . in order to precisely define a `` contact angle '' even in the case of weaker adhesion ,",
    "we introduce the sphere which is osculatory to the membrane at the point intersecting the revolution axis .",
    "we call @xmath33 its radius and @xmath34 the angle at which it intersects the substrate ( see fig .",
    "[ schema_general ] ) .",
    "finally , we define the extrapolation length @xmath35 as the distance between the point where the vesicle detaches from the substrate and the intersection between the osculatory sphere and the substrate .",
    "we shall denote throughout by the index zero all the quantities referring to the limit @xmath9 , where the vesicle exactly takes the shape of a spherical cap .",
    "therefore @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the height , radius , contact angle , and adhesion radius of the corresponding spherical cap .",
    "strong adhesion corresponds to the situation where the adhesion energy gain is very large compared to the elastic energy of the vesicle . since the energy of freely floating vesicles is of order @xmath7  @xcite , even for deflated vesicles , this condition can be expressed as @xmath40 it corresponds , for a given vesicle , to strong enough contact potentials  @xmath0 , or , for a given @xmath0 , to large enough vesicles .",
    "in this situation , elasticity can be treated as a first - order correction with respect to the asymptotic limit of infinite adhesion .",
    "we shall therefore first review the limit @xmath9  @xcite .      in this case , adhesion is the only relevant contribution to the free energy of the system , and @xmath19 is the only dimensionless parameter of the problem . taking into account the two geometrical constraints , and formally setting @xmath41 , the shape of the adhering vesicle",

    "this implies that infinitely strongly adhering vesicles and liquid droplets have the same ensemble of equilibrium shapes , although they are described by different sets of physical parameters .",
    "consequently , the equilibrium shapes in the asymptotic limit @xmath9 are spherical caps .",

    "the set of all the solutions for a fixed @xmath19 and all values of @xmath196 corresponds to a trajectory in the ( @xmath198 ) plane that has to be reconstructed by varying @xmath193 and @xmath71 .",

    ", @xmath31 differs nonetheless from its infinite adhesion limit @xmath39 by more than @xmath201 : significant deviations from the infinite adhesion limit are therefore predicted with a good precision by the asymptotic formula  ( [ lldev ] ) .    for vesicles of reduced volume in the range @xmath202 ,",
    "we have determined the threshold for @xmath29 at which the relative error between our analytical approximations and the exact results reaches @xmath174 . in fig .",
    "[ ordre1liml ] we show this threshold for the adhesion disc s radius  @xmath31 , in fig .",

    "[ ordre1limf ] for the derivative @xmath203 of the free energy with respect to the adhesion energy .",
    "the latter quantity is linked to the haptotactic force  ( [ haptotaxdev ] ) .",
    "but for the total height @xmath30 of the vesicle.,width=302 ]    typically , the @xmath174 threshold occurs for values of @xmath29 comprised between @xmath204 and @xmath205 ( see figs .",
    "[ ordre1liml][ordre1limf ] ) .",
    "let us consider the case of `` giant vesicles '' since they are optically observable ( typical size @xmath206@xmath207 ) .",
    "supposing an area of @xmath208 and a bending rigidity @xmath209j , the @xmath174 threshold occurs for values of @xmath0 in the weak adhesion range @xmath210@xmath211 .",
    "our analytical estimates seem therefore able to describe the adhesion of giant vesicles up to the lowest values of @xmath0 experimentally accessible . for smaller vesicles ,",
    "the threshold is more limitative , as it corresponds to higher adhesion energies @xmath0 .",
    "note also that in the case of weak adhesion , the picture could be quantitatively different for vesicles filled with a fluid denser than the outside medium , because of gravity effects .",
    "taking into account the effect of membrane elasticity to first - order in @xmath212 , we have analytically determined the global observables characterizing adhering vesicles .",
    "our calculation is based on the fact that if adhesion prevails over elasticity , most of the elastic contributions to the free energy are located in the `` contact angle region . ''",
    "we have numerically determined the region of validity of our analytical expansions , in the @xmath213 parameter space , corresponding to a @xmath174 maximum error .",
    "it turns out that for `` giant vesicles '' ( typical radius @xmath214@xmath215 m ) , this region comprises practically all the accessible adhesion surface energies  @xmath0 . besides , our analytical estimates correctly describe significant deviations with respect to the infinite adhesion limit .",
    "we have throughout assumed that the area  @xmath5 and volume  @xmath6 of the vesicle were strictly fixed , while vesicles actually possess small but finite stretching elasticity and osmotic compressibility .",
    "it is easily shown , however , that a self - consistent choice of the lagrange multipliers @xmath71 and @xmath72 yields the same equilibrium solution in the presence of arbitrary stretching and osmotic potentials .",
    "it follows that our expressions of @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath31 and @xmath30 remain correct provided that @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the actual area and volume ( that now depend on @xmath0 ) .",
    "measurements of the contact potential @xmath0 are usually performed by ricm imaging of the contact angle region  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath0 is inferred either from the local curvature @xmath216 through eq .",
    "( [ curvdec ] ) , or from the extrapolation length @xmath35 through eq .",
    "( [ lambda1 ] ) ( an approximated formula valid for @xmath128 is actually used  @xcite ) .",
    "the precision of the former measurement is limited by the fact that the vesicle s curvature varies abruptly close to its detachment point , the exact position of which is always slightly ambiguous .",
    "the extrapolation length measurement relies on the existence of a well defined asymptote of the vesicle s profile close to the contact angle region : it is therefore suitable only for the strongest adhesions . the expressions of @xmath31 and @xmath30 found in sec .",
    "[ order1 ] allow to envisage novel measurements of @xmath0 , based on _ global _ characteristics of the adhering vesicle . to this aim",
    ", one needs to know also the vesicle s total area and volume .",
    "they can be either directly determined by imaging a side view of the vesicle  @xcite , or inferred by osmotically deflating a spherical vesicle of known radius in a controlled way .",
    "the fact that @xmath0 can be determined through two independent measurements ( @xmath31 and @xmath30 ) allows to better estimate the experimental errors and to validate the model",
    ". moreover , such global measurements are complementary to the above - cited local ones , since they are more adapted for measuring weaker values of @xmath0 .",
    "the precision of the measurement should increase as @xmath0 decreases , as long as one remains inside the authorized zone of figs .",
    "[ ordre1liml ] and  [ ordre1limh ] .",
    "in fact , for @xmath0 too strong , @xmath31 and @xmath30 saturate , while for @xmath0 too weak the analytical expansions of @xmath31 and @xmath30 lose their validity .",
    "however , as we have seen , the low @xmath0 limitation is not relevant for `` giant vesicles '' .",
    "finally , the haptotactic force  ( [ haptotaxdev ] ) suggests the possibility to determine the size of suboptical vesicles by measuring their velocity of migration on a substrate presenting a controlled adhesion gradient , supposing a linear viscous friction law .",
    "fitting the evolution of the vesicle s velocity as a function of @xmath0 allows to determine the vesicle s area and volume , provided that the dependence of the friction coefficient on @xmath217 and @xmath19 is known .",
    "the latter could be determined using giant vesicles of known area and volume ."
