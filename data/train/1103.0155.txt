    "the sizes of the circumbinary disks and circumstellar disks depend on the binary system s semimajor axis , eccentricity , and mass ratio ( artymowicz & lubow 1996 ; armitage et al .",

    "hot and bad pixels were removed from the divided frames using the ` cosmicrays ` task .",
    "then , an averaged count in the sky region was subtracted .",
    "we judged that neither halo of the psf nor circumstellar structures extended at 6   away from the central star .",
    "the count was measured along a concentric circle ( radius of @xmath16 6   with a width of @xmath16 1  ) on the fs tau binary , avoiding the diffraction artifacts of the spider .",
    "the same reduction procedures were applied to the reference star frames .",
    "we subtracted the reference star frames from the object frames to detect faint structures buried in the halo of the central binary .",
    "the peak positions of the fs tau binary and reference star were measured with the ` imexamine ` task on all frames .",
    "for fs tau , the peak positions were able to be measured for 21 frames .",
    "for the rest frames , we did not identify the core of the psf .",
    "the secondary star ( fs tau ab ) was not resolved in the object frames because the averaged fwhm was about 04 .",

    "we calculated the positions of the secondary from the separation and p.a .",
    "in the @xmath1/acs image ( see @xmath32 ) . as the binary has only a separation of 023 ( 32 au ) and its total",
    "mass is 0.78   this yields an orbital period of about 210 years .",

    "one may consider that the @xmath0-band flux ratio can be calculated from the spectral types of aa and ab and the @xmath34-band flux ratio .",
    "however , since fs tau has near - infrared excess ( @xmath36 mag , @xmath37 mag , @xmath38 mag from 2mass ) and we can not identify whether the excess arises from fs tau aa and/or ab , we did not determine the flux ratio of aa and ab in the @xmath0-band .",
    "we are convinced from the final psf - subtracted image that the assumed flux ratio is appropriate .",
    "then the 12 reference star frames , except the frames with the asymmetric psfs , were combined .",

    "we checked the photometric accuracy under the unstable seeing condition .",
    "any object except for fs tau itself did not appear in the object frames .",
    "fs tau in the object frames is not appropriate for evaluating the photometric accuracy , because the core of the psf was under the mask .",
    "instead , we evaluated it with the @xmath17-band flux of fs tau , which was monitored during the integrations by the wavefront sensor in the ao system .",
    "the measured fluxes were stable with its standard deviation of 0.04 mag .",
