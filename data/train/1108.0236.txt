    "contrary to conventional lasers , random lasers have no cavity like a fabry - prot resonator @xcite .",
    "instead , they are made of a multiply scattering medium such as a semiconductor powder @xcite or a suspension of scattering particles in dye solution @xcite , which is excited by an external pump to introduce gain .",
    "multiple scattering of light in the random medium provides optical feedback and lasing modes are built on the quasimodes of the passive random system .",
    "a recent review devoted to the first lasing mode at threshold @xcite shows how the relation between lasing modes and quasimodes depends on the openness of the system . with strong confinement of light , as in the localization regime ,",
    "lasing modes have a nearly one - to - one correspondence with the localized modes of the passive system . in diffusive systems , quasimodes exhibit a large amount of spatial and spectral overlap but maintain a strong correspondence with the lowest threshold lasing modes . in systems which are more open , such as those in the quasi - ballistic regime , the correspondence significantly degrades .",
    "this is largely due to the intense pumping required to overcome high loss from the openness , which introduces a modification of the refractive index distribution .    far above the lasing threshold , in the case of multimode lasing",
    ", it was found that the correspondence between lasing modes and quasimodes begins to degrade in the diffusive regime @xcite .",
    "mode competition occurs due to gain saturation . with limited gain available , spatial hole burning takes place where the field intensity is large .",
    "thus , random lasing thresholds may increase in the multimode regime and lasing in some modes may be completely suppressed . in other words ,",
    "`` dead '' regions are produced in the spatial profile of gain caused by the low - threshold lasing modes which proves detrimental for lasing in other higher - threshold modes .",
    "illustrations of such strong nonlinear effects were made by taking into account the openness of the system and the nonlinearity to all orders via steady - state _ ab initio _ laser theory @xcite .",
    "nonlinear effects above threshold have also been studied in the time domain with full - wave simulations incorporating four - level atomic media @xcite .",
    "however , the effects of intrinsic noise , which cause dynamic changes to the atomic population and polarization @xcite , on nonlinear processes has not yet been taken into account .    in this paper ,",
    "a frequency - dependent linear gain model is first employed to examine lasing modes without the effects of gain saturation .",
    "gain saturation is then incorporated via full - wave maxwell - bloch simulations .",
    "comparison of the two methods determines the nonlinear effects of gain saturation .",
    "intrinsic noise in weakly scattering random lasers has been shown @xcite to alter lasing thresholds and introduce peaks in the emission spectra which were absent from the spectra without noise .",
    "thus , we examine how noise modifies the dramatic nonlinear effects introduced by gain saturation .",
    "the population inversion is found to be significantly affected by noise in the multimode lasing regime not far from the lasing threshold .",
    "spatial hole burning can be overcome to excite and amplify additional modes .",
    "finally , modal amplitudes are found to be linearized across the lasing threshold and in some cases , mode suppression can be mitigated .",
