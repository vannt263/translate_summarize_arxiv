    "the flooding and drying of a fluid on ground is a problem which has several applications in fluid mechanics such as coastal engineering , artificial lake filling , river overflow or sea intrusion on ground due to a tsunami .",
    "these works involves the modelling of the physical process near the triple contact line between the liquid ( the water ) , the gas ( the atmosphere ) and the solid ( the ground ) .",
    "the numerical simulation of this problem is very complex , due to the domain deformation and the triple contact line movement .",
    "some numerical approaches to solve this problem have been previously explored .",
    "for example , o. bokhove @xcite uses a conservative form of the shallow water equations associated to the discontinuous galerkin discretization .",
    "d. yuan et al .",
    "@xcite propose to use a non conservative form of the shallow water equations in total flow rate formulation and uses a finite difference scheme for the numerical computation .    in this paper , we use a two dimensional viscous shallow water model in eight velocity formulation .",
    "this model , called stokes - like by p.l .",
    "lions ( @xcite , section 8.3 ) is , in some sense , intermediate between the semi - stationary model and the full model of compressible isentropic navier - stokes model .",
    "this model can be obtained by integrating vertically the so - called primitives equations of the ocean @xcite with some hypothesis on the viscous terms .",
    "we have chosen this model because we can prove the existence of a solution under certain considerations as the smoothness of the initial conditions and an acceptable hypothesis on a boundary operator @xcite .",
    "after the presentation of the model we describe the numerical method based on the demonstration of the convergence proposed in @xcite . finally , we present some numerical examples in two idealized domains and we give some perspectives for other studies .",
    "we assume that we know a continuous function @xmath0 from @xmath1 to @xmath2 that represents the topography ( the level of the ground with respect to a reference level ) .",
    "we note @xmath3 ( an open simply connected set of @xmath1 ) the horizontal domain occupied by the fluid at time @xmath4 and @xmath5 the elevation of the fluid compared to a horizontal zero level .",
    "we set @xmath6 the eight of the water column , @xmath7 .",
    "the shallow water equations are based on a depth integration of an incompressible fluid conservation laws in a free surface - three dimensional domain .",
    "governing equations for @xmath8 and @xmath9 can be obtained in the usual way ( @xcite for example ) and the two - dimensional system can be written as follows @xcite : @xmath10 } \\",

    "@xmath14 represents external forcing ( for example the wind stress ) .",
    "these equations are completed by initial conditions ( @xmath15 ) and boundary conditions . in the following ,",
    "we assume that the boundary of the real domain is non - vertical .",
    "hence the variation of the surface elevation at the boundary imposes a modification of the horizontal domain occupied by the fluid .",
    "in many geophysical applications , the governing equations are solved in a domain @xmath16\\times\\omega^3_t$ ] whereby @xmath17 is a three dimensional moving domain .",
    "we denote by @xmath18 the exterior unit normal to this domain , and we set @xmath19 as its horizontal component . moreover we denote @xmath20 as the velocity of the fluid and @xmath21 as its horizontal component .    in the following , we assume that the ground of the sea does not have a vertical wall",
    ". then we have @xmath22 .",
    "the impermeability boundary condition on the ground for the three dimensional problem imposes @xmath23 .",
    "then , we have @xmath24 on the ground and , since @xmath22 , we obtain @xmath25 .",
    "-10truecm    at the surface , vertical velocity is equal to the lagrangian derivative of the function @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "we recall that we are interested in the effect of the overflow and we need to consider the problem in a moving domain that represents the domain actually occupied by the fluid . then we need to impose a condition on the moving boundary . at the triple contact line ( between air , ground and water ,",
    "see figure [ coupelaterale ] ) , the horizontal velocity at the surface ( @xmath28 ) is equal to the velocity at the bottom ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "similarly , we have @xmath30 , coherent with the fact that the lagrangian derivative of @xmath9 is equal to zero on this boundary .",
    "this property is not verified if , during its displacement , a part of the triple contact line touches a vertical wall . in this case",
    ", the boundary can not be represented by the line @xmath31 .",
    "this question is very interesting but not treated in this paper .",
    "the mean velocity @xmath8 used in the equations [ eqqm ] and [ eqm ] is related to the previous three dimensional velocity by @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "the two dimensional domain @xmath3 is the projection of the three dimensional domain @xmath34 on the horizontal plane .    for the depth integrated model ,",
    "we denote by @xmath35 the boundary of @xmath36 ( at initial time ) . assuming that @xmath35 is smooth enough , we define the deformed boundary as follows : @xmath37 , where @xmath38 represents the horizontal displacement @xmath39 and where @xmath40 denotes the lagrangian flow , i.e. the position at time @xmath4 of the particle located at @xmath41 at time @xmath42 . with these notations",
    ", we have the natural condition @xmath43 on @xmath44 , where @xmath45 .",
    "the continuity equation ( [ eqm ] ) can be written as follows : @xmath46 so , if at the initial time , @xmath47 then at all times @xmath48 . moreover , if @xmath49 then @xmath50 at all times .",
    "we conclude that the boundary ( and only the points of this boundary ) at the initial time can define the boundary at all times .",
    "for example , if at initial time the domain is simply connected , the domain remains simply connected at all times @xmath51 .",
    "we characterize the boundary motion @xmath44 by a condition on the normal component of the fluid stress tensor @xmath52 on the boundary @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a differential operator defined on @xmath35 taking into account the boundary forcing on the fluid ( see @xcite for example ) and @xmath55 is the jacobian matrix associated to the transformation @xmath56 . in @xcite , the authors show that if the operator @xmath54 is a laplace - beltrami operator ( @xmath57 and if the data are small enough , the problem has a solution .",
    "the condition on @xmath54 is necessary to obtain the smoothness of the boundary and allows the use of the classical sobolev injections @xcite .",
    "more precisely , in this paper , @xmath58 with @xmath59 and currently , we are not able to prove an existence result for @xmath60 . but numerically , it is possible to obtain physical acceptable results with less smoothness on this operator ( for example in @xcite we have obtained results by taking @xmath61 ) .",
    "it is not easy to characterize the operator @xmath54 .",
    "it needs a good physical interpretation and give sufficient mathematical smoothness to prove the existence of a solution of our problem .",
    "physically , this operator represents a friction condition in the triple contact line ( between the fluid , the solid domain and the air ) . in the literature ,",
    "a large number of physical approaches in the case of a wetting film of fluid or for a droplet @xcite are found .",
    "unfortunately , we can not use directly these results .",
    "firstly , we do not work at the microscopic scale ( mainly governed by the van der waals forces ) and we need to take into account the effect of these phenomena at large scale .",
    "secondly , the main effect studied for those phenomenon is in the vertical direction ( for example for the capillary effect ) but here , we use a depth integrated model .",
    "we use a numerical method based on the weak formulation of the problem in the domain @xmath3 depending on time .",
    "the ale method that here we use , has been used to solve the navier - stokes equations in a moving domain @xcite .",
    "we assume that at the initial time @xmath62 , the fluid domain is covered by a regular mesh ( for example , an usual finite element mesh ) .",
    "we also assume that on the boundary , each point of this mesh has the velocity of the fluid . the velocity of the internal points can be chosen arbitrarily , the only condition is to conserve the smoothness of the mesh at all times .",
    "then , at any time @xmath63 $ ] , the velocity @xmath64 of the moving mesh can be defined by solving the following problem : @xmath65 and we consider the following mapping @xmath66 where @xmath67}(\\omega_t\\times\\{t\\})$ ] .",
    "the relation between the different domains @xmath68 is given by the mapping @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the characteristic curve from @xmath71 to @xmath72 corresponding to the velocity @xmath64 in the space - time domain @xmath73 .",
    "for each time @xmath74 , we denote by @xmath75 and @xmath76 the ale velocity and the ale thickness : @xmath77 with these notations , we can write the ale formulation of the problem @xmath78    in what follows , we will use a first order time discretization to solve this problem ( see @xcite for more details about second order schemes ) .",
    "let @xmath79 , we note @xmath80 as the time step . for @xmath81 , @xmath82 , we set @xmath83 with boundary @xmath84 and @xmath85 in order to ensure the positivity of @xmath86 , the continuity equation is renormalised as follows @xmath87 with this renormalisation",
    ", we do not have conservation of the mass , but when we follow the evolution of the mass during a simulation ( e.g. in the first test presented in the following section ) , only small variations of the mass quantity are observed .",
    "we denote by @xmath88 ( respectively @xmath89 and @xmath90 ) the approximation of the exact solution @xmath91 ( respectively @xmath86 and @xmath92 ) .    then , we note @xmath93 and @xmath94 with @xmath95 the characteristic curve solution of : @xmath96 in our study , we approximate the foot of the characteristic by @xmath97 we set @xmath98 ( resp .",
    "@xmath99 ) the approximation of @xmath100 ( resp .",
    "@xmath101 . approximating the lagrangian derivative by a first order euler scheme , and using a linearised drag operator ,",
    "we obtain the following : @xmath102 implicitly , taking into account the equation [ eqdm1 ] , we have @xmath103 .",
    "this is an approximation at the first order in time of the initial shallow water problem .",
    "this problem is solved by a fixed point technic . a first approximation of [ eq12 ] is computed assuming @xmath104 and the approximation of @xmath105",
    "is then used in [ eq11 ] to obtain a first approximation of @xmath98 .",
    "we repeat this operation in order to obtain convergence of the system .",
    "prove of convergence can be fount in @xcite .",
    "we can not easily increase the order of this scheme because the ale formulation is only of the first order .",
    "the previous problem is solved on @xmath106 by using the spatial discretization proposed in the following section .",
    "after , we need to solve the problem given by equations [ pbc1 ] and [ pbc2 ] in order to compute the mesh velocity .",
    "each point @xmath107 with coordinates @xmath108 of the mesh is then moved with the first order approximation @xmath109 .",
    "the spatial discretization of the previous problem is based on the finite element galerkin method . in @xcite , an approach based on the galerkin method with a special basis",
    "is proposed , but this approach can not be applied easily if @xmath110 .",
    "we note @xmath111 the set of finite element functions of @xmath112 .",
    "the weak formulation of our approximated problem is @xmath113 where the operator @xmath114 is the trace operator from @xmath106 to @xmath84 .",
    "then the equations ( [ tensionbord ] ) and ( [ equa_10 ] ) give @xmath115 where @xmath116 .",
    "we then use a first order discretization of the partial time derivative : @xmath117    the first part of the right hand of this equation needs to be included on the left hand of the global problem and the second part on the right hand .",
    "the global weak formulation is : @xmath118    on @xmath44 , @xmath119 where @xmath120 is a point of @xmath44 and the sum is computed on all finite element functions .",
    "then , on the initial boundary @xmath35 , we have the decomposition @xmath121 with the same @xmath122 .",
    "formally , we can use two kinds of boundary conditions :    1 .   a condition of normal displacement of the boundary .",
    "we write @xmath123 where @xmath38 is the normal displacement . with this condition ,",
    "the well posed weak formulation associated to the diffusion operator is @xmath124 where @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "the boundary condition is then imposed on @xmath127 and @xmath128 since we do not want to impose a condition on @xmath129 or @xmath130 .",
    "2 .   a condition on the displacement of the boundary @xmath131 where @xmath38 is a vector . with this condition , the well posed weak formulation associated to the diffusion operator is @xmath132 and the boundary condition",
    "is then imposed on @xmath133 ( more precisely , we need to take into account the trace tensor including condition on @xmath9 in the boundary , but we assume @xmath134 on this boundary ) .",
    "[ remarqueoscil ] we can note that the friction term @xmath135 is necessary to stabilize the flow . indeed ,",
    "if we use the following decomposition @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the intersection of @xmath138 and the space of harmonic functions , we can see that the functions of @xmath139 are not controlled by the laplacian operator .",
    "we present in the following section a case with @xmath140 where we do not have damping of the flow .",
    "the previous method is tested in order to simulate the behavior of a fluid in a simplified domain .",
    "we assume that the domain is axisymmetric using the function @xmath141 . at the initial time",
    "@xmath142 , the fluid at rest touches the wall ( @xmath143 ) ( see figure [ domainvert ] ) .",
    "-5truecm    physically , our initial domain @xmath36 is a disc with a radius of 130 meters .",
    "this domain is meshed with triangles ( 420 triangles for the mesh m1 , 470 for the mesh m2 and 1002 for the mesh m3 ) .",
    "the height of the column of water at the centre is 1 meter ( since @xmath144 at the centre of our domain ) .",
    "fluid viscosity is @xmath145 and gravity coefficient @xmath11 is assumed equal to @xmath146 in order to amplify the elevation .",
    "we apply a forcing at the surface of this fluid .",
    "this forcing is usually taken into account by applying the continuity of the horizontal stress tensor on the surface .",
    "so , for the three dimensional model , @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the wind velocity ( at ten meters over the flow for the ocean for example ) and @xmath149 is a `` drag coefficient '' assumed to be constant . using the vertical integration of the vertical operator @xmath150 , and assuming @xmath151 , we obtain a forcing condition on the mean velocity @xmath152 .",
    "we use here @xmath153 hence , we observe an oscillation of the free surface of the water plan . at each oscillation ,",
    "a part of the water moves on ground and a part of the ground is uncovered by this water ( see figure [ vuecoupe ] ) .",
    "-18truecm    in the last part of the remark [ remarqueoscil ] , we indicate that with @xmath140 a part of the flow component is not diffusive .",
    "more precisely , our solution is only a gradient .",
    "if we do not take into account boundary friction effects or bottom friction effects , a part of the fluid is not diffusive . to observe this effect , we plot ( on figure [ oscillations ] ) the level of a boundary point according to time .",
    "we can observe an accumulation of energy on the fluid due to the numerical approximation , and this accumulation is not compensated by diffusive term .    in figure [ oscillationsamorties ]",
    ", we plot the variation of the same point taking into account the drag coefficient @xmath154 . with this term , all the modes of the fluid are diffusive and ,",
    "if we stop the forcing , global energy of the fluid vanishes .",
    "-0.5truecm    in figure [ evolutionkinetic ] , we plot the time evolution of the kinetic energy of the flow for the different meshes ( m1 , m2 and m3 ) .",
    "we only have a little difference for all these meshes but a very expensive cost for the mesh m3 .",
    "-0.5truecm    after the forcing phase ( 20 seconds ) , we can observe the transformation of the kinetic energy in potential energy and conversely .",
    "when the kinetic energy vanishes , potential energy is maximal . if the drag coefficient is assumed to be equal to zero , the amplitude of the oscillation does not decrease .",
    "finally , figure [ massconservation ] represents the evolution of the mass of fluid compared to the initial mass .",
    "even if we do not have a rigorous conservation of the mass , due to the renormalisation of the mass equation , the variation of the mass is very little .",
    "-0.5truecm      in this second numerical experiment , we use a more complex domain to test our numerical method .",
    "we assume that the domain is axisymmetric using the function @xmath155 . @xmath156 and @xmath38 are chosen in order to at the distance @xmath157 of the centre of the fluid domain , the fluid touches the wall ( see figure [ dom_ini ] ) .",
    "-2truecm    we use the same external forcing as for the first experiment ( [ forcing ] ) .",
    "but , due to the specific form of the topography , a part of the fluid goes to the external crown .",
    "we present some results of the simulation in figure [ dom_evol1 ] .",
    "recalling that the shallow water equations are based in the continuum mechanic , it can not cut this domain with a finite energy .",
    "hence , even if the thickness of the layer of water is very low , we conserve a thin film of water between all the parts of the domain occupied by the fluid .",
    "-4truecm    we recall that the computation is only made in the moving two - dimensional domain @xmath3 .",
    "mathematical study proves that the main difficulty is to conserve the smoothness of the boundary .",
    "this result can be observed in this simulation because , at the final time , we have contact between two parts of the boundary ( see last part of the figure [ dom_evol1 ] ) .",
    "since we do not use a `` good '' boundary operator , we do not have sufficient smoothness on the boundary .",
    "we observe then a change of connectedness and a hole appears in the fluid domain .",
    "the presented work suggests that capillarity effect needs to be incorporated into the evolution equations , and more precisely in the triple contact line .",
    "theoretical results presented in @xcite give sufficient smoothness for the capillarity term used in equation [ tensionbord ] .",
    "the main difficulty is to describe the capillarity effects on the depth integrated model and in a dynamical system .",
    "a possible approach is to test some boundary operator and to compare numerical and experimental result .",
    "this approach will be proposed in future studies .",
