    "star clusters are an excellent tracer for stellar populations in the galaxy .",
    "being a nearby spiral galaxy with very low inclination , m51 is one of the best targets for the star cluster studies in the late type galaxy .",
    "recently , the hubble heritage program provided m51 images in @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands taken with hst / acs ( mutchler  2005)@xcite and a few early results of star cluster studies based on this data are already available ( e.g. , gieles  2006@xcite ; hwang & lee 2006@xcite ; scheepmaker  2006@xcite ; haas  2006 ) .",
    "we have detected star cluster candidates using sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996)@xcite from the hst / acs data and then visually inspected these candidates with @xmath3 mag to select the clean sample of star clusters .",
    "the final star cluster catalog includes about 2200 class 1 ( circular shape without neighbor ) and 1400 class 2 ( non - circular shape and/or with neighbors ) star clusters .",
    "detailed information on the source detection and star cluster classification will be provided in @xcite .",
    "star clusters in m51 are mostly distributed along the spiral structures of the galaxy .",
    "however , class 2 clusters are more tightly bound along the spiral arms while some class 1 clusters are even found in the inter - arm regions .",
    "comparison with the hii region catalog ( lee  2007 _ in preparation _ ) reveals that class 2 clusters show stronger associations with hii regions than class 1 clusters .",
    "most star clusters in m51 , regardless of class 1 or 2 , are bluer than @xmath4 but some clusters are as red as @xmath5 and these clusters tend to be found farther than @xmath6 from the m51 center .",
    "the large age peak at @xmath8 yrs appears not to be a real feature but it still represents the existence of very young star clusters.,width=188 ]     @xmath7 .",
    "the large age peak at @xmath8 yrs appears not to be a real feature but it still represents the existence of very young star clusters.,width=188 ]",
    "we have measured the size of all star clusters using ishape ( larsen 1999)@xcite .",
    "the result shows that most star clusters are as large as @xmath9 pc but there are also significant number of clusters with @xmath10 pc .",
    "many of these large clusters are also found to be redder than @xmath4 , which makes them ` faint fuzzy ' clusters .",
    "interestingly , the faint fuzzy clusters are mostly located around the sb0 galaxy ngc 5195 and they show different spatial distribution from the red [ @xmath11 and compact [ @xmath12 pc ] clusters as shown in figure 1 . for furhter information ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we have fitted the @xmath0 photometry data of star clusters to the model sed of @xcite to estimate ages of star clusters .",
    "detailed information on the sed fitting will be given in our forthcoming paper .",
    "figure 2 shows the age distribution of star clusters and there are three peaks at about 100 , 250 , and 500 myrs .",
    "these ages roughly coincide with the encounter times of ngc 5194 and 5195 expected by theoretical models : the single passage model ( toomre & toomre 1972@xcite ) expects the passage of ngc 5195 to have taken place at about @xmath13 myrs ago while the multiple passage model ( salo & laurikainen 2000@xcite ) expects one more passage at about @xmath14 myrs ago .",
    "this result suggests that the dynamical history of the host galaxy is strongly correlated with the formation of star clusters ."
