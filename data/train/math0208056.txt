    "for nonzero rational @xmath0 let @xmath1 be the elliptic curve @xmath24 over  @xmath3 . since @xmath1 and @xmath25 are isomorphic for any nonzero rational @xmath26 , we may assume without loss of generality that @xmath0 is a squarefree integer .",
    "the change of variable @xmath27 shows that @xmath1 is also isomorphic with @xmath28 ; this may also be seen from the weierstrass equation @xmath29 for  @xmath1 .",
    "the arithmetic of the curves @xmath1 has long attracted interest , both for its connection with the classical `` congruent number '' problem ( see ( * ? ? ? * ch.xvi ) ; @xmath10 is a `` congruent number '' if and only if @xmath1 has positive rank ) and , more recently , as a paradigmatic example and test case for results and constructions concerning elliptic curves in general ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the curves @xmath1 have some special properties that make them more accessible than general elliptic curves over  @xmath3 .",
    "they have complex multiplication and are quadratic twists of the curve @xmath16 .",
    "this led to the computation of the sign of the functional equation of the @xmath30 : it depends on @xmath31 , and equals @xmath32 or @xmath8 according as @xmath10 is in @xmath33 or @xmath34 mod  @xmath14 .",
    "we shall be concerned with the case of sign  @xmath8 .",
    "the conjecture of birch and swinnerton - dyer ( bsd ) predicts that the ( arithmetic ) rank of any elliptic curve  @xmath35 over a number field  @xmath36 , defined as the of its  group @xmath37 , should equal the order of vanishing at @xmath38 of @xmath39 , known as the `` analytic rank '' @xmath40 .",
    "the bsd conjecture implies the `` bsd parity conjecture '' : the arithmetic rank is even or odd according as the functional equation of @xmath39 has sign @xmath32 or @xmath8 .",
    "it would follow that if the sign is @xmath8 then @xmath35 always has positive rank . in our context , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 , this leads to the conjecture that @xmath1 has positive rank ( and",
    "thus that @xmath10 is a `` congruent number '' ) if @xmath10 is any be squarefree because @xmath43 for any odd integer  @xmath44 .",
    "our integers  @xmath0 are not divisible by  @xmath45 , and therefore can not be of the form @xmath46 for any even  @xmath44 . ] integer of the form @xmath47 , @xmath48 , or @xmath49 .",
    "we prove :    let @xmath0 be an integer such that @xmath10 is congruent to @xmath11 , @xmath12 , or  @xmath13 mod  @xmath14 and also satisfies @xmath15",
    ". then @xmath1 has positive rank over  @xmath3 .",
    "[ thm1 ]    in our ants-1 paper  @xcite we announced such a result for @xmath50 .",
    "our main tool for proving theorem  [ thm1 ] is the same : we use the modular parametrization of @xmath16 or @xmath17 to construct a rational point @xmath18 on each @xmath1 from cm points on modular curves , and usually compute @xmath18 to enough accuracy to distinguish it from any of the rational torsion points on @xmath1 .",
    "faster computer hardware and new software were both needed to extend the computation to  @xmath51 .",
    "the faster machine made it feasible to compute @xmath18 for more and larger  @xmath0 .",
    "cremona s program mwrank , not available when @xcite was written , found rational points on the curves @xmath1 on which we could neither distinguish @xmath18 from a torsion point nor find a rational nontorsion point by direct search .",
    "this happened for @xmath19 values of  @xmath10  less than @xmath52 of the total , but too many to list here a rational point on @xmath1 for each such  @xmath0 .",
    "these tables , and further computational data on the curves @xmath1 , can be found on the web starting from ` < www.math.harvard.edu/~elkies/compnt.html > `",
    ".    our computations also yield conjectural information on the rank of  @xmath1 : the rank should equal  @xmath53 if and only if @xmath18 is nontorsion . in half the cases , those for which @xmath10 or @xmath54 is of the form @xmath49 , we obtain this connection from kolyvagin s theorem  @xcite , which gives the `` if '' direction unconditionally , and the gross - zagier formula  @xcite , which gives the `` only if '' direction under the bsd conjecture .",
    "neither kolyvagin nor gross - zagier has been proved to extend to the remaining cases , when @xmath10 or @xmath54 is of the form @xmath47 .",
    "but we expect that similar results do hold in these cases , and hence that @xmath1 has rank  @xmath53 if and only if @xmath18 is nontorsion also when @xmath10 or @xmath54 is congruent to  @xmath11 mod  @xmath14 .",
    "one piece of evidence in this direction is that whenever we found @xmath18 to be numerically indistinguishable from a torsion point , the selmer groups for the between @xmath1 and the curve @xmath55 were large enough for @xmath1 to have arithmetic rank at least  @xmath21 .",
    "we extended the list of curves @xmath1 of conjectural rank @xmath56 to @xmath22 by imposing the condition from the start and computing @xmath18 only for those @xmath0 that pass this test .",
    "we find a total of 8740 values of  @xmath10 .",
    "the list not only provides new numerical data on the distribution of quadratic twists of rank @xmath57 with large  @xmath10 , but also suggests unexpected biases in the distribution that favor some congruence classes of  @xmath10 s .",
    "let @xmath0 be a squarefree integer such that @xmath10 is congruent to 5 , 6 , or  7 mod  8 .",
    "set @xmath58 if @xmath0 is odd , and @xmath59 if @xmath0 is even .",
    "then @xmath60 is an imaginary quadratic field in which the rational prime  @xmath61 splits if @xmath62 or @xmath63 , ramifies if @xmath64 , and is inert if @xmath65 .",
    "a point @xmath66 is equivalent to a point @xmath67 of @xmath16 or  @xmath17 ( according as @xmath0 is odd or even ) whose complex conjugate @xmath68 equals @xmath69 .",
    "if @xmath70 is any point of @xmath16 or  @xmath17 over  @xmath60 then @xmath71 satisfies @xmath72 , and thus amounts to a point of  @xmath1 over  @xmath3 .",
    "to prove theorem  [ thm1 ] for @xmath1 , it will be enough to find @xmath73 or @xmath74 and show that the point @xmath75 corresponding to @xmath76 is not in @xmath77 $ ] .",
    "we use the modular parametrizations of @xmath16 and @xmath17 by the modular curves @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "these curves have `` cm  points '' parametrizing cyclic isogenies of degree  @xmath80 or  @xmath81 between elliptic curves of complex multiplication by the same order in  @xmath60 . if the prime @xmath61 splits in @xmath60 , these points are defined over the class field of  @xmath60 ; otherwise they are defined over a ray class field .",
    "( in the former case , the cm  points are often called `` heegner points '' ; in the latter , @xcite applies the term `` mock heegner points '' , though birch points out that heegner s seminal paper  @xcite already used both kinds of points to construct rational points on  @xmath1 , and the distinction between the two cases was a later development . ) in either case , we obtain a point @xmath82 defined over  @xmath60 by taking a suitable subset of these cm points , mapping them to @xmath16 or @xmath17 by the modular parametrization , and adding their images using the group law of the curve .",
    "see @xcite for more details on these subsets .",
    "now the key computational point is that the size of each subset is proportional to the class number of @xmath60 , and thus to @xmath83 when averaged over  @xmath0 .",
    "this is much smaller than the number of terms of the series needed to numerically estimate @xmath84 , which is on the order of  @xmath0 : as explained for instance in  @xcite , for a general elliptic curve @xmath85 of conductor  @xmath86 it takes @xmath87 terms to adequately estimate @xmath88 , and @xmath89 or @xmath90 ( according as @xmath0 is odd or even ) so @xmath91 is of order  @xmath0 . as explained in  @xcite , the numerical computation of each cm point as a point on the complex torus @xmath92 or @xmath93 to within say @xmath94 takes essentially constant time : find a representative  @xmath95 in a fundamental domain for the upper half - plane mod @xmath96 or @xmath97 , and sum enough terms of a power series for @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the modular form for @xmath16 or  @xmath17 . thus it takes time @xmath100 ( and negligible space ) to approximate @xmath82 for each @xmath101 .",
    "is a cm  form ( so most of its coefficients vanish ) and the normalizers of @xmath96 , @xmath97 in @xmath102 can be used to obtain an equivalent @xmath95 with imaginary part at least @xmath103 and @xmath104 respectively .",
    "these efficiencies represent a considerable practical improvement , though they contribute negligible factors @xmath105 to the asymptotic running time of the computation . ]",
    "we implemented this computation in gp and ran it for @xmath106 .",
    "for all but 1375 of the 303979 squarefree values of @xmath15 congruent to 5 , 6 , or  7 mod  8 , we found that @xmath18 is at distance at least @xmath107 from the nearest point of  @xmath1 , and is thus a rational point of infinite order .",
    "for each of the remaining @xmath0 , the point @xmath18 is numerically indistinguishable ( at distance or @xmath93 .",
    "] at most @xmath108 , usually much less ) from a point .",
    "we believe that @xmath18 then actually is a torsion point , and thus that we must find a nontorsion rational point on @xmath1 in some other way .",
    "we did this as follows .",
    "we first searched for rational numbers @xmath109 with @xmath110 such that @xmath111 is @xmath0 times a square for @xmath15 .",
    "this is a reasonable search since we may assume that @xmath112 , require that one of the factors @xmath113 of @xmath114 have squarefree part @xmath115 and that another have squarefree part at most @xmath116 , and loop over those factors . by using the squarefree parts of @xmath117 instead of @xmath118 when @xmath119 . ]",
    "this took several hours and found points on all but  @xmath120 of our @xmath19 @xmath1 s .",
    "the remaining curves were handled by cremona s mwrank program , which used a @xmath61-descent on each curve ( exploiting its full rational ) to locate a rational point .",
    "this completed the proof of theorem  [ thm1 ] .",
    "it might seem surprising that we were able to find a rational point on each of the 1375 @xmath1 s for which we could not use @xmath18 .",
    "many curves @xmath1 , even with @xmath0 well below our upper limit of  @xmath51 , have rank  @xmath53 but generator much too large to locate with repeated @xmath61-descents ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the reason we could find nontorsion points on the curves @xmath1 with @xmath121 $ ] is that these are precisely the curves @xmath1 of odd sign that should have rank at least  @xmath21 , which makes the minimal height of a non - torsion point much smaller than it can get in the case .",
    "we explain these connections below , and then report on our computations that extend to @xmath122 the list of @xmath10 such that @xmath9 is odd and conjecturally at least  @xmath21 .",
    "consider first the cases @xmath62 and @xmath63 . in these cases the prime  @xmath61 , which is the only prime factor of the conductors of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , is split in @xmath60 .",
    "therefore the results of gross - zagier  @xcite and kolyvagin  @xcite apply to  @xmath18 .",
    "the former result gives the canonical height of  @xmath18 as a positive multiple of @xmath123 .",
    "therefore @xmath23 if and only if @xmath18 is torsion .",
    "the latter result shows that if @xmath18 is nontorsion then in fact the arithmetic rank of  @xmath1 also equals  @xmath53 .",
    "hence any @xmath1 of rank  @xmath21 or more must be among those for which we could not distinguish @xmath18 from a torsion point .",
    "the hypotheses of the theorems of gross - zagier and kolyvagin are not satisfied in the remaining cases @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "however , numerical evidence suggests that both theorems generalize to these cases as well .",
    "for instance , when @xmath18 is numerically indistinguishable from a torsion point , @xmath1 seems to have rank  @xmath21 . for small @xmath10",
    "we readily find three independent points ; for all @xmath10 in the range of our search , @xmath1 and each of the curves @xmath55 and @xmath124 isogenous with @xmath1 has a group large enough to accommodate three independent points .",
    "when @xmath18 is nontorsion but has small enough height to be recovered from its real approximation by continued fractions , we find that it is divisible by  @xmath61 if and only if the group has rank at least  @xmath11 , indicating that @xmath1 has either rank @xmath56 or nontrivial @xmath125 $ ] .",
    "( the former possibility should not occur , and can often be excluded by on one of the curves isogenous to  @xmath1 . ) both of these observations are consistent with a generalized gross - zagier formula and the conjecture of birch and swinnerton - dyer , and would be most unlikely to hold if the vanishing of  @xmath18 had no relation with the arithmetic of  @xmath1 .",
    "we thus expect that also in these cases @xmath1 should have rank @xmath57 if and only if @xmath18 is a torsion point .",
    "the conjecture of birch and swinnerton - dyer also explains why curves @xmath1 of rank @xmath56 have nontorsion points of height much smaller than is typical of curves @xmath1 of rank  @xmath53 .",
    "this conjecture relates the regulator of the  group of @xmath1 with various invariants of the curve , including its real period and the leading coefficient @xmath126 ( where @xmath127 ) .",
    "now the real period is proportional to @xmath128 .",
    "the leading coefficient is @xmath129 under the generalized riemann hypothesis for @xmath130 , or even the weaker assumption of the lindelf conjecture for this family of @xmath131-series ( see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "one expects , and in practice finds , that it is also @xmath132 ( otherwise @xmath130 has zeros @xmath133 for very small positive  @xmath134 ) .",
    "thus we expect the regulator to grow as @xmath135 , at least if @xmath136 is small , which should be true for most  @xmath10 .",
    "hence the minimal nonzero height would be at most @xmath137 .",
    "when @xmath138 this grows so fast that already for @xmath139 there are many curves @xmath1 with generators much too large to be found by . , but not @xmath135 because @xmath18 must be computed to high accuracy to recognize its coordinates as rational numbers from their real approximations .",
    "note that in our computations we showed only that @xmath18 is nontorsion and did not attempt to determine it explicitly in @xmath140 . ]",
    "but for @xmath141 the minimal nonzero height is at most @xmath142 , so @xmath10 must grow much larger before a search becomes infeasible .",
    "_ remark _ on curves curves @xmath1 of even sign : for such curves we readily determine whether @xmath143 by using the waldspurger - tunnell formula  @xcite to compute @xmath144 . if @xmath145 then @xmath146 and @xmath1 also has arithmetic rank  @xmath147 by kolyvagin ( or even coates - wiles  @xcite because @xmath1 has cm ) .",
    "if @xmath148 then @xmath149 , and we can prove that @xmath1 has positive arithmetic rank if we find a nontorsion point .",
    "we expect that the minimal height of such a point is @xmath150 .",
    "this grows slower than the @xmath135 estimate for rank  @xmath53 , but fast enough that searches fail for @xmath10 much smaller than our bound of @xmath51 . even in the odd - rank case that concerns us in this paper , it is the curves of rank  @xmath21 that make it hard to extend theorem  [ thm1 ] much beyond @xmath106 : searching for points on those curves take time roughly @xmath151 , which eventually swamps the polynomial time @xmath100 required to find those curves .",
    "we extended to @xmath152 our search for @xmath18 numerically indistinguishable from torsion points .",
    "these are the curves that we expect to have rank at least  @xmath21 . since we do not expect to extend theorem  [ thm1 ] to @xmath122 , we saved time by requiring that the selmer groups for the isogenies between @xmath1 and @xmath55 be large enough to together accommodate an arithmetic rank of  @xmath21 . for very large @xmath153",
    "this is a negligible saving because most  @xmath0 pass this test .",
    "but it saved a substantial factor in practice for @xmath152 : the test eliminated all but @xmath154 of choices of @xmath155 , all but @xmath156 of @xmath157 , all but @xmath158 of @xmath159 , and all but @xmath160 of @xmath161 .",
    "we found a total of 8740 values of  @xmath0 for which @xmath18 appears to be a torsion point .",
    "we expect that each @xmath18 is in fact torsion and that the corresponding @xmath1 all have rank at least  @xmath21 .",
    "some @xmath18 might conceivably be a nontorsion point very close to @xmath162 $ ] , but this seems quite unlikely ; at any rate no @xmath18 came closer than @xmath107 but far enough to distinguish from @xmath162 $ ] .",
    "all the curves probably have rank exactly  @xmath21 : the smallest @xmath10 known for a curve @xmath1 of rank  @xmath11 exceeds @xmath163  @xcite . at any rate none of our curves with @xmath164",
    "can have rank  @xmath11 : we applied mwrank s descents - only mode to each of these @xmath1 and the isogenous curves , and in each case obtained an upper bound of  @xmath21 or  @xmath45 on the rank .",
    "our curves @xmath1 and the isogenous curves include many examples of conjectural rank  @xmath21 and nontrivial  @xmath125 $ ] .",
    "there are striking disparities in the distribution of our 8740 values of  @xmath10 among the allowed congruence classes .",
    "the odd classes @xmath47 and @xmath49 account for @xmath165 and @xmath166 curves @xmath1 of presumed rank  @xmath21 . but even @xmath10 s are much more plentiful : there are @xmath167 of them , almost as many as in the two odd classes combined .",
    "this might be explained by the behavior of the , which depends on the factorization of  @xmath10 , or the fact that we are twisting a different curve : @xmath16 for odd  @xmath0 and @xmath17 for even  @xmath0 .",
    "but the @xmath167 even  @xmath0 s are themselves unequally distributed between the @xmath168 and @xmath169 cases , the former being significantly more numerous : @xmath170 as against @xmath171 .",
    "( see figure  1 . )",
    "this disparity is much larger than would be predicted by the test , which in the range @xmath22 favors @xmath172 but only by a factor of @xmath173 whereas @xmath170 exceeds @xmath171 by almost  25% .",
    "note too that the survival rates would predict a preponderance of @xmath161 over @xmath47 , whereas the two counts are almost identical .",
    "do these disparities persist as @xmath153 increases , and if so why ?",
    "naturally we would also like to understand the overall distribution of quadratic twists of rank @xmath56 , not only for the `` congruent number '' family but for an arbitrary initial curve in place of  @xmath1 .",
    "we hope that the computational data reported here , and more fully at ` < www.math.harvard.edu/~elkies/compnt.html > ` , might suggest reasonable ideas and conjectures in this direction .",
