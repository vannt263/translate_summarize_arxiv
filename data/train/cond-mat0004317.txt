    "administered - rate products represent a substantial fraction of the liabilities of banks and savings and loans and the ability to describe the response of these products to changes in market rates is of critical importance for interest - rate risk management . of administered - rate nonmaturity deposits",
    "can be estimated using the equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the deposit balance at time @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the market rate , @xmath5 is the administered deposit rate , and @xmath6 denotes the non - interest charges associated with maintaining the account .",
    "clearly there is interest rate sensitivity in the present value : explicitly in the appearance of the market rate in eq .  1 and implicitly in both the sensitivity of the balances and the administered deposit rate to changes in the market rate .",
    "] unlike market rates ( e.g.  u.s  treasury bond ) that are set in an auction environment or contractual rates that respond instantaneously to market rates in a prescribed manner ( e.g.  home mortgage ) , administered rates ( e.g.  interest rates on checking and savings accounts ) are set by a committee seeking an equilibrium rate in response to changes in market rates .",
    "factors that bear on this equilibrium pricing include expected future market rates , competitor pricing responses , and depositor s short - term and long - term balance elasticities ( i.e. propensity to change balance levels in response to rate changes ) ; all of which are known with limited certainty .",
    "balance elasticities are exceedingly difficult to estimate with any reliability because banks usually do nt preserve much historical data and do nt usually employ the resources needed to evaluate the data that does exist .",
    "consequently , these committees indicate a certain amount of inertia .",
    "the general proclivity of pricing committees to leave well enough alone has been found in a variety of empirical studies that have established that administered rates are driven by market rates and that the response of an administered rate to the market rate is not instantaneous .",
    "this behavior has been modeled by a number of investigators who have settled largely on the use of partial adjustment models to describe the non - instantaneous response of administered rates to changes in market rates .",
    "while these models often adequately describe the observed administered - rate behavior , they largely lack a theoretical basis with which to interpret the resulting parameters and with which to link rate policy to the rate model . in this paper",
    "we show that the formal assumptions upon which previous treatments of administered - rate dynamics are based are identical to the assumptions underlying the formal treatment of a variety of relaxation processes in condensed - matter physics including magnetic , dielectric and anelastic relaxations @xcite .",
    "all these physical phenomena involve time - dependent relaxations toward newly established equilibria that follow from a change in a driving force and can be described in terms of linear response theory . since these physical phenomena share a common mathematical description of relaxation / response and since these physical phenomena and administered - rate dynamics share a variety of underlying assumptions we make the _ ansatz _ that these phenomena all share a common mathematical description . given this we can move beyond an _ ad hoc _ treatment of administered - rate dynamics and employ the phenomenological models that have been developed to model these physical relaxation processes to model the dynamics of administered - rate deposits .",
    "the theory of anelasticity provides a useful framework with which to develop our treatment of administered - rate dynamics because of the similarity between some of the equations that have appeared in the literature on administered rates and the scalar representation of anelasticity .",
    "we show in sec .",
    "[ sec : dynamics ] how the theory of anelasticity can be used to develop a hierarchy of continuous - time models of the administered - rate response function that include , as a subset , the partial adjustment models that have appeared in the literature .",
    "we find that the continuous - time models that follow from this approach lend themselves to an easy mapping between certain aspects of rate policy and of model structure .",
    "we illustrate the utility of this approach in sec .",
    "[ sec : application ] by modeling the rate - response behavior for two administered - rate products : money market accounts and time deposits . in sec .",
    "[ sec : friction ] we explore the notion of dissipation embodied in these relaxation dynamics to develop a formal notion of market friction .",
    "fundamental to essentially all descriptions of administered - rate product rates is the notion that there exists an equilibrium relationship between the product rate @xmath7 and the market rate @xmath8 that is of the form @xmath9 where the tilde indicates equilibrium .",
    "the constant @xmath6 is often taken to denote the costs to the bank of servicing the product .",
    "the proportionality factor @xmath10 has , in the case of nonmaturity deposits , been interpreted as the fraction of deposited monies that federal reserve requirements allow to be lent is taken to be one minus the marginal reserve rate . ] . while the interpretation of @xmath10 in terms of a federal reserve requirement clearly breaks down for products without such a requirement , eq .",
    "[ eq : hooke ] remains , nevertheless , a basic assumption of equilibrium behavior for most administered - rate products .",
    "the rate relationship in eq .",
    "[ eq : hooke ] is characterized by three features : ( i ) a unique equilibrium product rate for each level of the market rate , ( ii ) instantaneous achievement of the equilibrium response , and ( iii ) linearity of the response .",
    "we note in passing that the equilibrium rate is completely recoverable .",
    "the empirical dynamics of administered rates , however , demonstrate that the equilibrium response is not achieved instantaneously and a lagged response is observed . to incorporate this observed lag into the relationship between the product rate and the market rate previous research",
    "has augmented eq .",

    "this functional for is the basis of most of the econometric studies that have appeared in the literature to date . while some researchers have posited that the coefficients in eq .",
    "[ eq : paf ] depend on the direction of the change in the market rate , obrien @xcite has recently pointed out , however , that such an assumption is not consistent with the assumed equilibrium relationship given in eq .",
    "[ eq : hooke ] .",
    "the theory of anelasticity is a generalization of the theory of ideal elasticity that allows for time dependence in the response of a material to an applied stress . like previous treatments of administered - rate dynamics",
    "it assumes the existence of a unique equilibrium relationship between stress and strain known as hooke s law .",
    "the equilibrium relationship given in eq .",
    "[ eq : hooke ] is , in fact , identical to the scalar version of hooke s law of ideal elasticity @xmath13 with the product rate playing the role of strain @xmath14 and the market rate playing the role of stress @xmath15 . induced by market forces .",
    "to the extent that market rates respond to market forces in an essentially instantaneous manner , we can write @xmath16 from which it follows that @xmath17 : hooke s law relating the product rate to the market stress via the compliance @xmath18 . ] in this context the constant @xmath6 can be interpreted as the contribution to the product rate driven by a different `` stress '' : the cost to the bank of maintaining the account .",
    "the differential dynamics of anelasticity are not obtained through an direct application of lagged variables via eq .",
    "[ eq : paf ] but , rather , by noting that the assumption of linearity implies a general market - product rate relationship of the form @xmath19 while the econometric application of this equation , like eq .",
    "[ eq : paf ] , requires an analysis of the number of terms needed to describe the observed dynamics , the use of eq .",
    "[ eq : general ] enables an economic interpretation of these terms and the coefficients . in practice a wide range of relaxation dynamics",
    "have been found to be described well by the comparatively simple differential relationship @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the rate at which the product rate relaxes to the equilibrium level , @xmath22 denotes that fraction of the response that occurs instantaneously , and @xmath23 denotes the ultimate extent of the response function ( @xmath24 ) . the change in the product rate with respect to time is , in this case , a function of the current product rate , the current market rate , and the change in the market rate with respect to time .",
    "some intuition for the interpretation of this differential product - market rate relationship can be obtained for the case of a simple market rate shock .",

    "the product rate then relaxes to equilibrium with the market rate ( in this example @xmath33 ) .",
    "varying @xmath22 , and @xmath23 ( or , equivalently @xmath28 ) one can span the range of responses from being completely instantaneous @xmath34 to being completely time dependent @xmath35 .",
    "a variety of partial adjustment models can be developed for the differential relationship given above by discretizing the integral form of @xmath36 given in eqs .",

    "[ eq : sas ] yields a popular partial adjustment expression , partial adjustment models with more temporal lags do exist in the literature on administered - rate products .",
    "more temporal lags can be introduced in two different ways .",

    "[ eq : sas ] ( i.e. the product rate is based on considerations of the level and change of the rates ) then partial adjustment models can be obtained using different discretization techniques . alternatively ,",
    "greater temporal lags follow naturally if the deliberations of the committee include the change in the slope of the market and product rates as a function of time .",
    "we examine each in turn .",
    "partial adjustment models based on eq .",
    "[ eq : sas ] with greater temporal lags can be obtained through higher - order discretizations such as the adams - bashford methods .",

    "applying this to eq .",
    "[ eq : sas ] yields @xmath47 which shares many structural aspects with the partial adjustment model developed by the office of thrift supervision ( ots ) @xcite .",

    "[ eq : sas2 ] yields , via the second derivatives , a function of the form @xmath55 while this expression contains the same number of temporal lags as eq .",
    "[ eq : pam3 ] and has a structure similar to the of the ots model @xcite , it has 2 more degrees of freedom than eq .",
    "[ eq : pam3 ] due to the more complex relaxation process .",
    "the anelastic partial adjustment models differ from the partial adjustment models that have appeared in the literature in two important ways .",
    "first , number of free parameters is determined by the nature of the differential rate relationship , while the number of terms is determined independently by the nature of the discretization of the differential rate relationship .",
    "second , the decoupling of the number of terms from the number of free parameters in the partial adjustment model allows the partial adjustment model to better reflect the nature of the how pricing committees adjust rates in response to market rates .",
    "while the differential rate relationship provides a phenomenological representation of the observed lag in the product - rate adjustment , the discrete form of the model can be expressed so as to reflect the number of previous time periods included in the deliberations of the pricing committee .",
    "thus , the anelastic approach provides a convenient way to avoid overspecification of the relationship between the product and market rates while simultaneously providing the flexibility needed to properly represent the data used in rate policy decisions .",
    "having demonstrated that the functional form of the partial adjustment models that have appeared in the literature can be recovered from the anelastic formalism using standard discretization techniques , we note in passing that there is a far simpler approach to the modeling of these rate dynamics that may be of use in future work . as pointed out by nowick and berry @xcite manipulation ( and discretization ) of the differential product - market rate equations",
    "becomes increasingly complex as the order of these equations increase .",
    "an appropriately chosen manner of increasing the order of the differential equation ( employed , for example , in eq .",
    "[ eq : sas2 ] ) allows us to write down the response function ( cf .",
    "[ eq : sasj ] and [ eq : sasj2 ] ) directly as @xmath56 \\ ; , \\label{eq : boltzmann}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 represents both the order of the differential terms included in eq .",
    "[ eq : general ] and the number of relaxation terms .",
    "then , as a consequence of the linearity of the system - aka the boltzmann superposition principle , we can , given a history of market rate changes @xmath58 applied at successively increasing times @xmath59 write the product rate as @xmath60 these simple relations provide a straightforward calculation of the product rate in response to changes in the market rate with a response function that is specified easily in terms of 2 types of coefficients : a relaxation rate and the fraction of the response corresponding to that rate .",
    "while by no means an exhaustive collection of the models that can be generated from eqs .  [ eq : hooke ] and [ eq : general ] , eqs .  [ eq : pam1 ] , [ eq : pam2 ] , [ eq : pam3 ] , [ eq : pam4 ] , and [ eq : boltzmann ] illustrate , nevertheless , the rich variety of partial adjustment models the follow from a single linear differential relationship between the product and market rates that , in turn , follows from an anelastic interpretation of the relationship between the product and market rates .",
    "we now apply the anelastic approach to the description of the observed dynamics of administered rates .",
    "we have used the anelastic approach described above to model the dynamics of the cash maximizer@xmath61 ( cmx ) interest rates @xcite and of the rates for retail certificates of deposit ( cds ) .",
    "the cash maximizer@xmath61 account is a money market deposit account that requires a minimum of usd 2,500 to open and to avoid service charges .",
    "unlike the cmx product that has no defined maturity , the retail cd used in this study has a 3-month maturity .",
    "the cd that we shall analyze below has a face value of usd 2,500 .",
    "the cd and cmx rates are set by committee .",
    "the market rate driving changes in the cmx rates is taken to be that rate most closely matching a matched rate along the bank s cost - of - funds curve .",
    "since the marginal cost of funds for bank of america during this period is best reflected by the london interbank offer rate ( libor ) for short maturities , we have taken 3-month libor to be the market rate .",
    "the month - end cmx rates are shown together with 3-month libor for the period march 1983 - february 1997 in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmx ] . comparing these rates",
    "we see that the cmx rate is always less than 3-month libor and that the cmx rate roughly tracks the movements of 3-month libor in a largely attenuated and somewhat lagged manner .",

    "an identical analysis was performed on the month - end cd rates shown , together with 3-month libor for the period october 1983 - february 1997 , in fig .",
    "[ fig : cd ] .",
    "the results of the fitting described above are shown in table [ tab : cd ] .",

    "[ fig : cd ] . as in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig : cmx ] , differences among the various fits can not be meaningfully resolved by eye on this scale .",
    "we see in figs .",
    "[ fig : cmx ] and [ fig : cd ] that modeling changes in these product ( cmx , cd ) rates as an anelastic response to a market rate changes results in an expression ( e.g. eq .  [ eq : pam1 ] ) that can track the observed product rate quite well .",
    "this is remarkable given that these two products have quite different maturity assumptions : the cd has a fixed maturity while the cmx product has no maturity .",
    "these results , together with the observation made above that economic assumptions concerning the relationship between the market and product rates are the same as those of an anelastic process , provide compelling evidence that these product rates respond to market rates as if via anelastic relaxations .",
    "in a mechanical system the time dependent stress - strain behavior is `` an external manifestation of internal relaxation behavior that arises from a coupling between stress and strain through internal variables that change to new equilibrium values only through kinetic processes such as diffusion '' @xcite . similarly , time dependent market - administered rate behavior is an external manifestation of internal relaxation behavior that arises from a coupling between the market and product rates through internal variables such as competitor pricing responses and depositors balance elasticities that change to new equilibrium values only after the passage of time . in both mechanical and market systems",
    "this temporal lag in response to an applied force is a manifestation of friction .",
    "our identification of administered - rate dynamics as relaxations also provides a way of quantifying market friction . an expression for this dissipation",
    "- also known as  internal friction \" in the anelasticity literature - can be obtained by considering the case of a periodic market scalar stress @xmath62 due to a periodic market force @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the market stress at time @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 is the cyclic frequency of the market stress . the product rate will track the market force ( and market rate , due to linearity as discussed above ) with a lag that can be represented by a loss angle @xmath68 : @xmath69 these expressions for the market and product rates imply a frequency dependent proportionality factor @xmath70 ( the fourier transform of @xmath71 ) that is complex @xmath72 and a loss angle related to the components of @xmath70 by @xmath73 .",
    "the isomorphism between anelasticity and administered rates implies the existence of a state variable - a market equivalent of energy - at any phase in the market cycle given by @xmath74 taken between the start of the cycle up to the point of interest .",

    "[ eq : sas ] yields @xmath78 thus we see that the existence of an anelastic response ( @xmath79 ) in a market system implies a dissipation of market energy and a formal definition of market friction . as",
    "the existence of this loss angle is due to the gathering and processing of information needed to reestablish equilibrium - @xmath80 - it follows that the loss angle is also a measure of relative efficiency discussed by farmer and lo @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : loss ] where we see the loss angle as a function of cyclic frequency @xmath67 for both the cmx and cd rates . in the limit",
    "@xmath81 the market cycle become so long that any finite relaxation rate is , on the time scale of a market cycle , instantaneous and the rate systems behave as if there is no relaxation with @xmath82 . in the limit @xmath83 the market cycle becomes so short that the only component of the system that responds to the market force is the instantaneous portion @xmath22 . between these extremes",
    "we see the loss due to the relaxation behavior . for @xmath84 cycles per month ( cycles greater than about 6 months ) the cmx rate loss is greater than that of the cd .",
    "this is consistent with our expectation that the rate system that relaxes faster requires less market energy to achieve equilibrium and is , therefore , less lossy and more efficient . for @xmath85 ( cycles",
    "less that about 6 months ) the cd rate has a greater fractional loss per cycle .",
    "this perhaps unexpected result follows from the relative relaxation rates of these two systems .",
    "as the cyclic frequency increases the relaxation component begins to `` freeze out '' and the system behaves in an increasingly elastic manner with @xmath86 . since the cd rate relaxes faster than the cmx rate , the relaxation component of the cmx rate `` freezes out '' first making it less lossy than the cd rate in this frequency range",
    "administered rates are unique in that they are set by a group of individuals attempting to maximize profits in the face of market forces .",
    "as the future direction of market forces , commonly measured by market rates , is unknown and committee decisions exhibit a degree of inertia , equilibrium between the market force and administered rate is achieved only after the passage of a certain amount of time .",
    "historically this process has been formally expressed by an assumed linear equilibrium relationship and an _ ad hoc _ partial adjustment model to describe the change of the administered rate in response to a change in the market rate .",
    "common to most previous treatments of administered - rate dynamics are the postulates that ( i ) for every market rate there is a unique equilibrium rate , and vice versa , ( ii ) the equilibrium response is achieved only after the passage of sufficient time , and ( iii ) the market - administered rate relationship is linear .",
    "a contribution of this paper is the observation that these postulates also form the basis for a well - developed theory of relaxation processes in the physical sciences : indeed , these postulates are paraphrased directly from the introduction to anelasticity presented by nowick and berry @xcite .",
    "we have examined this market system and found that the assumed equilibrium rate relationship corresponds to hooke s law of elasticity and that the relaxation dynamics of administered rates are quite similar to anelastic relaxations . developing this isomorphism we demonstrated that the basic structure of popular _ ad hoc _ partial adjustment models could be reproduced easily using standard techniques for discretizing the simplest anelastic differential relationship between the administered rate and market rate .",
    "we applied these models to the observed interest rate dynamics of a cash maximizer@xmath87 account and a certificate of deposit and found that , in spite of significant differences in the maturity features of these products , their dynamics are described well as anelastic relaxations .",
    "finally we found that the anelastic description of these dynamics provides a natural definition of market friction as the realization of internal friction or dissipation in this market system .",
