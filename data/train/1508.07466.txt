    "the constrained random phase approximation as proposed in @xcite has allowed for the first principles determination of the effective local coulomb interaction , the `` hubbard @xmath14 '' , that is used as the bare interaction in a low - energy hamiltonian for a wide range of correlated materials ranging from transition metals @xcite , their oxides @xcite , pnictides and chalcogenides @xcite , @xmath1-electron materials @xcite to organic conductors @xcite and solid hydrogen @xcite .",
    "probably the most important advantage of crpa over previous methods such as the constrained lda @xcite or linear response @xcite schemes is the possibility of adapting @xmath14 to the chosen low - energy model . for reviews ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the underlying idea of the constrained random phase approximation is the observation that the hubbard @xmath14 should be obtained as the matrix element of a _ partially - screened _ interaction in some localized basis .",
    "this partially - screened interaction is constructed such that screening at the rpa level calculated for the low - energy hamiltonian or for the full coulomb hamiltonian lead to the same result for the fully - screened coulomb interaction .",
    "mathematically , this can be obtained by constructing a partial polarization function where certain screening processes are suppressed : @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the polarization within the low - energy space , which at the rpa level is a sum over particle - hole transitions that take entirely place within the low - energy subspace .",
    "the partially - screened interaction is then obtained as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the bare coulomb interaction .",
    "finally , the matrix of hubbard interactions @xmath92 is obtained as matrix elements of @xmath93 within the basis of localized wannier functions used for the construction of the hamiltonian .",
    "subtleties arise when one aims at constructing a multi - orbital hamiltonian which comprises more orbital degrees of freedom at the one - particle level than in its interacting part .",
    "the commonly applied strategy @xcite in this case is to construct wannier functions for all orbitals , but exclude screening transitions corresponding to the interacting degrees of freedom only . however , ambiguities arise in this case when the correlated bands are entangled with itinerant ones .",
    "several disentanglement strategies have been proposed @xcite , but it may appear somewhat insatisfactory to deal with effectively an altered one - particle band structure , in particular since by construction , the stronger the entanglement , the larger the deviations .",
    "alternatively , one may think that in these cases it could be advisable to rather reconsider the philosophy of cutting out only the few correlated states out of a bigger number of entangled states living roughly at the same energy .",
    "our work presents a well - defined solution following this philosophy .",
    "elemental cerium has intrigued the solid state community for decades due to its isostructural volume - collapse transition .",
    "this `` @xmath18-@xmath94 '' transition is of first order below a critical temperature t@xmath12 = 600k , and ends in a second - order critical point at t@xmath12 . at room temperature",
    "the decrease in volume when going from the @xmath94 to the @xmath18 phase is as large as 15@xmath0 .",
    "a curie - weiss magnetic susceptibility in the @xmath94 phase signals the presence of localized @xmath4 electrons that delocalize in the @xmath18 phase where the magnetic susceptibility becomes pauli - like . in this phase ,",
    "the @xmath4 electrons participate in the bonding ( resulting in the smaller volume ) and the formation of quasiparticles , as seen in photoemission @xcite .",
    "the origin of this transition has been the subject of intense debate in the literature .",
    "the `` mott transition picture '' interprets it as a delocalization - localization transition in the @xmath4 shell only @xcite .",
    "the `` kondo volume collapse '' ( kvc ) picture @xcite in contrast attributes the leading role to the hybridization between the @xmath4 electrons and ( @xmath23- ) itinerant states : the stronger hybridization in the @xmath18-phase leads to a high kondo temperature and thus to screening of the @xmath4 local moment , while the high - volume @xmath94-phase has a low kondo temperature , leading in practice to unscreened moments at intermediate temperatures .    cerium has long served as a test material for methods that go beyond the lda @xcite and in particular for dmft - based electronic structure calculations @xcite . combined dft+dmft was found to be able to disentangle subtle electronic - structure changes in the hybridization to elucidate the mechanism of the transition , and give a description of spectral , optical and magnetic properties in agreement with experiments .",
    "it was also emphasized , however , that at any relevant temperature the entropic contribution dominates over the internal energy changes and pressure contribution such that the question of the existence of a double minimum in the internal energy acquires a somewhat academic character .",
    "we mention very recent qmc calculations @xcite that advocate the existence of a transition down to zero temperature .    with the advent of more efficient monte carlo techniques for the dmft equations in the multi - orbital case in recent years",
    ", the problem has been extensively revisited , and not only total energies , but also entropy and free energy have been computed @xcite .",
    "recent work has also focused on the role of spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "while many - body calculations for cerium have thus been extremely successful , @xmath14 values have generally been used as adjustable parameters , and several authors have discussed the difficulties in determining the effective hubbard interactions from first principles .",
    "this comes without surprise since this material can be considered a `` worst - case '' scenario , precisely due to the strong hybridization of the @xmath4-states with itinerant conduction band states present at the same energy .",
    "has presented a detailed study of various choices of low - energy models , arriving at the conclusion that any low - energy hamiltonian of @xmath1-@xmath15 type would have @xmath22-values lower than 1 ev in crpa .",
    "this illustrates the problem : there is a clear consensus in the literature that a much larger value of 5 to 6 ev is necessary to reproduce the available experimental findings .",
    "nilsson et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a disentanglement scheme which , by essentially replacing the original band structure by an approximate one with reduced hybridization , yields larger ( though still too small ) values of 4.3 ev and 5.4 ev for @xmath18 and @xmath94 cerium respectively .",
    "nio has been put forward as a challenge to solid state theory and electronic structure calculations since the very early days : mott highlighted the inadequacies of the band picture in describing the physics of this compound .",
    "nio is an antiferromagnetic insulator below a nel temperature of 525 k. above t@xmath95 , the antiferromagnetic order disappears , but the material remains insulating with a large gap of 4 ev that largely exceeds the energy scale of the nel temperature ) .",
    "furthermore , its spectral properties are remarkably insensitive to the presence or absence of magnetic order .",
    "this calls for a theoretical description of the insulating nature without relying on magnetic order .",
    "the story became more involved with the seminal work of zaanen , sawatzky and allen @xcite , who distinguished between mott insulators where the gap opens due to the coulomb blocking between correlated states of the same shell character , and charge - transfer insulators where the hubbard interactions are larger than the o @xmath5 to ni @xmath3 charge - transfer energy such that the first ionization states are in fact of o @xmath13 character .    in nio",
    ", it was already known that a satellite feature at -8 ev binding energy is mainly of @xmath2 character , while the low - energy states at the fermi level have large oxygen @xmath5 character .",
    "a series of photoemission ( including resonant photoemission ) works elucidated the different transitions in detail @xcite .",
    "nio was treated within many - body perturbation theory within the gw approximation by aryasetiawan and gunnarsson @xcite .",
    "the authors found the gap to open within this approximation , but also pointed out failures concerning the gap character which remains mott - hubbard like , and satellite structures related to the strongly - atomic character of the @xmath3 states .",
    "the first dmft works on nio used a hamiltonian where only the tm @xmath3 states were included @xcite . soon thereafter , it was pointed out that this was questionable due to the @xmath2-ligand interplay at the fermi level .",
    "several subsequent works included ligand states as itinerant states in the one - body hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "however , none of the standard double counting corrections appeared to be appropriate in this case @xcite , and nio still appears to be a challenge to dmft - based or dmft - like theories @xcite .",
    "the actinide dioxides uo@xmath6 , puo@xmath6 and npo@xmath6 are insulating materials with similar gaps ( of 2.1 ev @xcite , 2.9 ev @xcite and 2.8 ev @xcite respectively , but quite different ground states .",
    "uo2 has been and remains the subject of intense interest from the applied materials perspective thanks to its application as a nuclear fuel .",
    "electronic structure calculations thus focus not only on questions of stability of different structures , but also attempt to assess the physics of impurities resulting from the radioactive decay processes .",
    "we mention for example the study of he atom incorporation into uo@xmath6 crystals by @xcite , where lda+u with @xmath96 ev was employed . for an extensive review and recent work",
    "see @xcite .",
    "interestingly , corrections to simple dft - lda calculations turn out to be necessary not only for the description of spectral properties but even in assessing the energetics , and uo@xmath6 has become a playground for electronic structure approaches . while the value of @xmath14 has typically been considered an adjustable parameter or guessed from spectroscopy experiments , we note that the values employed coincide remarkably well with our results discussed in the main text .",
    "the series of actinide dioxides has also attracted much interest due to their exotic low - temperature ( multi - polar ) ordered states . while in puo@xmath6",
    "the @xmath97 configuration leads to a non - magnetic ground state , uo@xmath6 has a complex antiferromagnetic order below a nel temperature of 30.8 k @xcite , with a transverse 3-k arrangement driven by quadrupolar interactions .",
    "npo@xmath6 on the other hand displays a longitudinal 3-k order below an ordering temperature of 25 k , with a rank-5 magnetic multipole ( `` triakontadipole '' ) . despite being difficult due to the noncollinear character of the order and high - rank order parameters , lda+u calculations are successful in describing the multi - polar order with interaction values of @xmath98 ev @xcite .",
    "their complex electronic structure has always been considered a challenge also for purely functional - based first - principles calculations , and it is not surprising that the actinide oxides became a playground and testbed for hybrid functionals ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a comprehensive review of various electronic structure calculations of the actinide oxides is given in @xcite .",
    "here we present the derivation of the shell - folded hamiltonian by the peierls - feynman - bogoliubov variational principle in a step - by - step manner and determine the form of our effective interactions @xmath99 and @xmath100",
    ".    consider the @xmath52 hamiltonian @xmath101    and the auxiliary hamiltonian @xmath55 where @xmath66 are the effective coulomb interactions for the @xmath2 and @xmath13 manifolds .",
    "we find their optimal values by minimizing @xmath102 + { \\langle h_{\\bf r } - \\tilde{h}_{\\bf r } \\rangle}_0 $ ] with respect to @xmath56 and @xmath57 , where @xmath59 refers to the average taken with the auxiliary hamiltonian .",
    "let us also extend the definition @xmath103 where @xmath104 or @xmath13 .",
    "then , from the stationarity condition @xmath105 we obtain @xmath106 and an analogous equation for @xmath57 .    solving the system of equations , we have for @xmath107 , @xmath108    simplifying this expression gives @xmath109    assuming that the total number of particles is invariant with respect to changes in the effective parameters , namely that @xmath110 or equivalently that @xmath111 we can simply the above to @xmath112    thus , we obtain that @xmath113    while the above derivation is presented for spin- and orbital - averaged interactions for simplicity , it is equally applicable to the orbital - resolved interactions @xmath114 .",
    "as long as we assume the intershell interaction to be an orbital - independent average @xmath36 , the resulting effective interactions are obtained from an effective reduced slater integral @xmath115 .",
    "note that quadratic terms @xmath37 are unchanged .",
    "as we are devising an effective model for the _ local _ @xmath60 , and as our summations run explicitly over all orbitals contained therein , we do not have to consider either the number of equivalent atoms within the unit cell or its coordination .",
    "in the principal part of the letter , we derived a low - energy model that we showed to be successful in treating intershell interactions in addition to the intrashell interactions . here ,",
    "using nio as an example , we describe the construction of the `` ring '' orbitals centred on the correlated site as a superposition of the ligand @xmath13 orbitals .",
    "this ring orbital construction is inspired by the cell - perturbation methods @xcite that emerged as a consequence of the zhang - rice construction @xcite for the cu superconductors .",
    "nio adopts the rock - salt structure with a face - centred cubic lattice of ni atoms intercalated with a face - centred cubic lattice of o atoms .",
    "as the conventional unit cell contains four formula units , for simplicity , we choose to work globally in the cartesian coordinate system with the primitive unit cell vectors @xmath116 our basis consists of one ni atom at @xmath117 and one o atom at @xmath118 .",
    "we define the corresponding @xmath119-vectors @xmath120 such that @xmath121 .    in order to find matrix elements of @xmath122",
    ", we first determine the ni @xmath3 to o @xmath5 hopping directions . using the slater - koster parametrization @xcite , we write the matrix elements of the real - space tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath123 as functions of the @xmath13-@xmath13 , @xmath13-@xmath2 and @xmath2-@xmath2 two - center bond integrals that give the strength of bonding in a given direction , reflecting the relative orbital lobe positions .",
    "we use the standard notation of @xmath124-bonding if the lobes point to each other and @xmath125-bonding if the lobes are parallel .",
    "the resulting matrix is finally fourier - transformed to @xmath122 in momentum space .",
    "we note that , besides hopping , the cubic crystal field splitting of ni @xmath3-states into @xmath126 and @xmath127 ( parametrized in the usual notation as @xmath128 ) is also included in @xmath122 .",
    "the final @xmath122 in matrix form is given in table [ tab : hk ] .",
    "the diagonalization of this hamiltonian yields the tight - binding band structure .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in table [ tab : literature_u ] we present an overview of hubbard u values used for calculations for uo@xmath6 in the literature .",
    "it is remarkable how close most of these values are to the result of our shell - folded theory .    nevertheless , a recent work by koloren _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite presented lda+dmft calculations using a larger value of @xmath79ev .",
    "the authors show that the observed spectral function closely resembles spectra calculated within the hubbard i approximation using a smaller @xmath14 of 3 ev .",
    "apart from a satellite structure at about 10 ev , the spectral features between these two theories presented an impressive match .",
    "they also note that these @xmath14 values are slightly on the small side relative to experiment .",
    "this is consistent with the observation in ref .   that the best description of the low - temperature ordered phase is obtained within lda+u with @xmath129 ev .",
    "et al . _  add an interesting discussion of the differences in the treatment of screening in lda+u and lda+hubbard i. they argue that screening by ligand states is absent at the lda+u or lda+hubbard i levels such that the @xmath14 used must already incorporate these screening processes . for lda+dmft , on the other hand , they argue that some screening comes in through the coupling of the @xmath1-states to a the dynamical bath , requiring a larger @xmath14 .",
    "our crpa calculations for the reduction of @xmath14 by screening through the ligands agrees well with these estimates .    for completeness",
    "we note that there is an additional effect .",
    "@xmath14 values will depend on the basis used with the two extremes being a set of localized atomic - like @xmath1- and @xmath13-orbitals and a block - diagonal basis where @xmath1-@xmath13 hybridization enters effectively .",
    "we illustrate this on a simple two - orbital model with atomic - like @xmath1- and @xmath13-orbitals , hybridizing with strength @xmath130 .",
    "the eigenvalues read , in terms of the energies of the local levels @xmath131 and @xmath132 of the @xmath1 and @xmath13 state respectively : @xmath133 and the eigenvectors can be expressed in terms of the atomic states @xmath134 , @xmath135 : @xmath136 with @xmath137 .",
    "since @xmath22 transforms as @xmath138 , the values in an atomic - like basis are reduced when transforming to a basis that block diagonalizes the @xmath80 hamiltonian .",
    "the precise amount of reduction depends on the orbitals since the hybridization is strongly orbital - dependent .",
    "the rewriting of the hamiltonian presented in the main text of our paper also allows for a deeper understanding of the relation between cluster model calculations and dft+dmft .",
    "indeed , by definition , the cluster model assumes the total particle number to be fixed to specific integer values , and diagonalizes the cluster hamiltonian for those . in dmft , in general",
    ", the bath introduces the possibility of charge fluctuations and the above assumption becomes less obvious . a cluster approximation for insulators",
    "is well justified since the bath hybridization is small . for metallic systems , restricting the hamiltonian the low - energy correlated subspace avoids the problem .",
    "the zhang - rice - like construction presented above provides a way to do so explicitly .",
    "otherwise , when the o @xmath13-states are to be kept explicitly in the description , the shifts induced by the changes in the particle number might have to be taken into account explicitly ."

    "<S> this requirement imposes that charge may be displaced from the correlated site to the ligand orbitals within the cluster as a result of changes in the interaction , which is equivalent to our assumption that screening takes dominantly place within the immediate neighbourhood of a given atom . imposing the requirement that increasing the interaction strength only results in charge flow from a site to its nearest neighbours in the single - orbital extended hubbard model ( that is , in an effective hamiltonian with local and intersite interactions ) , gives rise to an analogous result as derived in @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the effective interaction becomes @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the nearest - neighbour interaction . </S>",
    "<S> here , a multi - orbital model with two correlated shells and intershell interactions is mapped onto a model with reduced intrashell interactions only and a coupling only to the total charge on a cell , or if @xmath71 can also be neglected , onto a model with only one correlated shell .    </S>",
    "<S> we now discuss how the above shell - folding scheme resolves contradictions arising in modeling specific materials . for @xmath18-ce , </S>",
    "<S> our sf scheme finds @xmath72 ev , giving @xmath73 ev . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to the value usually used for cerium . </S>",
    "<S> more interestingly , the intrashell interactions @xmath74 ev for the @xmath2-orbitals are by the same mechanism renormalized to @xmath75 , since the intershell interaction equals the initial @xmath2-@xmath2 interaction within numerical accuracy , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ce ] at @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> this justifies the construction of the hamiltonian for dmft calculations for cerium , and in particular to the fact that only @xmath1-states are treated as correlated . </S>",

    "<S> the slater integrals @xmath81 needed to parametrize these interactions are given in table [ tab : uvalues ] . </S>",
    "<S> the increased localization of the @xmath1-orbitals in the @xmath1-@xmath80 model relative to the @xmath1-@xmath1 model is reflected in the larger values of @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of @xmath1-@xmath1 interactions in uo@xmath6 is significantly larger in the @xmath80-@xmath80 model , signaling the importance of @xmath13-to-@xmath1 screening transitions . </S>",
    "<S> while integration of the intershell interactions reduces @xmath78 to the sf value of 4.6 ev , this value remains larger than that obtained in the @xmath1-only models . as we proceed along the actinide series , the value of the @xmath1-@xmath1 interaction @xmath78 in the @xmath1-@xmath80 model decreases from 3.9 ( uo@xmath6 ) to 3.5 ( puo@xmath6 ) to 3.4 ev ( cmo@xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the increased screening efficiency of the o 2@xmath13-states as the charge - transfer gap shrinks outweighs the decreased @xmath1-orbital extension as the nuclear charge increases . </S>",

    "<S> for uo@xmath6 , the @xmath13-@xmath1 charge - transfer energy calculated from the local part of the dft hamiltonian , @xmath83 ev , is larger than the @xmath84 ev indicating the mott - hubbard character of the gap in uo@xmath6 ( opening between @xmath1-dominated states ) . on the other hand , puo@xmath6 and cmo@xmath6 , which respectively have @xmath85 and @xmath86 ev , </S>",

    "<S> the gap between the pes and ipes peaks is largely determined by @xmath22 ( given the classification of uo@xmath6 as a mott - hubbard insulator ) and is therefore sensitive to the value of @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the calculations both within the @xmath1-@xmath1 and @xmath1-@xmath80 hamiltonians severely underestimate the gap . </S>",
    "<S> the sf model @xmath78 matches the experimental estimate of @xmath87 ev to numerical precision @xcite and yields spectra in excellent agreement with experiments .    in summary </S>",
