    "of the @xmath4 1200 catalogued planetary nebulae ( pne ) in our galaxy , less than a dozen are truly metal - poor . these halo or `` type  iv '' pne , in the terminology of peimbert ( 1978 , 1990 ) , have ( o / h ) abundances more than a factor of 4 below solar , even allowing for the notorious disparity between stellar and nebular abundance scales due to uncertainties in nebular electron temperature structure ( e.g. peimbert 1967 , 1995 ; dinerstein 1990 ) .",
    "not surprisingly , this small sample has been the target of intense scrutiny in order to determine their chemical compositions .",
    "these studies have revealed that the ratios among the heavy elements in the halo pne are non - solar and differ from object to object ( e.g. torres - peimbert , rayo , & peimbert 1981 ; pea et al .",
    "1992 ; howard , henry , & mccartney 1997 ) .",
    "the heavier @xmath5-capture elements such as ar and s are more deficient than the cno group , and it has been argued by a number of authors that the former are more indicative of the initial stellar composition ( barker 1980 , 1983 ; torres - peimbert et al .",
    "1981 ) . however , since some important ions do not give rise to optical or uv emission lines , having ground configurations that produce only infrared fine - structure lines , the total abundances of these elements may be under- or over - estimated when these ions are not directly observed ( e.g. dinerstein 1995 ) .",
    "this circumstance has motivated a number of studies of infrared emission lines in pne using ground - based and space observatories ( dinerstein 1980a , 1980b ; beck et al .",
    "1981 ; pottasch et al .",
    "1986 ; liu et al .",

    "garnett & lacy ( 1993 ) attempted to measure the [ ] 10.5 @xmath6 line in two of the most metal - poor halo pne , ps  1 ( also known as k648 ) and bb  1 ( bobn  1 ) , to test the possibility that abundances inferred from the optical lines alone , which sample only [ ] and [ ] , might be too low . using irshell ( lacy et al .",
    "1989 ) , a fore - runner of the instrument we used here , they set stringent upper limits on the [ ] line fluxes and confirmed that the s / h abundances in these objects are indeed much lower than o / h .",
    "this result was consistent with earlier determinations of s / h by barker ( 1983 ) and others , and with the suggestion that elements such as ar and s provide a more reliable benchmark of the composition of the progenitor star , whereas o / h and possibly ne / h may be enhanced by internal processing ( torres - peimbert & peimbert 1979 ; barker 1980 , 1983 ; dopita et al .",

    ", we present measurements of [ ] 10.5 @xmath6 and [ ] 12.8 @xmath6 in two additional halo pne , dddm  1 and h  4 - 1 , in addition to new optical line measurements of the former .",
    "our detections of the infrared lines in dddm  1 and upper limits for their fluxes in h  4 - 1 confirms the idea that there are two classes of pne with the same range of o / h values : modestly metal - poor objects with normal heavy - element ratios , and extremely metal - poor objects in which o / h has been self - enriched during the agb phase .",
    "the mid - ir observations were obtained with texes , the texas echelon cross",
    "echelle spectrograph ( lacy et al . 2002 ) , at nasa s infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) on mauna kea , in late june 2001 .",
    "a 3.0@xmath7-wide slit was employed with slit lengths of @xmath1 7.5@xmath7 and 9@xmath7 respectively at 10 and 12 @xmath0 m .",
    "these apertures are large enough to contain essentially all of the line emission from these compact nebulae .",
    "the weather conditions were only fair , but the observed lines were doppler shifted to relatively clean parts of the atmosphere ; the radial velocity of dddm  1 is @xmath1 304  km  s@xmath8 ( barker & cudworth 1984 ; herefter b84 ) and that of h  4 - 1 is @xmath1 141  km  s@xmath8 ( miller 1969 ) .",
    "all of the observations were obtained at air masses less than 1.2 .",
    "we nodded the telescope 4@xmath7 or 5@xmath9 along the slit in order to increase the observing efficiency , with dwell times of 3 - 12 seconds per beam position .",
    "total integration times are given in table  1 .",
    "the objects were identified visually using the telescope on - axis camera , and offset guiding was used while observing .",
    "the data were reduced using the standard texes pipeline ( lacy et al .",
    "we removed the background emission by taking differences between target frames and blank sky frames , and corrected for pixel response variations and atmospheric effects by subtracting a sky frame from a blackbody frame to create a flat field , first - order atmospheric correction , and flux calibration .",
    "these frames are taken every 3 to 10 minutes .",
    "the zero point for the wavelength scale of each observation set was determined by specifying the pixel value and wavelength of one atmospheric line in one order .",
    "this process typically is accurate to better than 1  km / s across the entire observed region .",
    "after flatfielding , we resampled the array so that the spectral and spatial dimensions are orthogonal and run along rows and columns .",
    "we extracted the final spectra by summing over @xmath12.5@xmath10 on each side of the nod .",
    "flux calibrations were performed using similarly extracted spectra of @xmath5  boo and @xmath11  vir .",
    "where no line was detected , we set upper limits ( 3@xmath12 ) by summing over spectral regions corresponding to the width of the detected lines in dddm  1 . for an object which uniformly fills the aperture ,",
    "the resolving power of the 3.0@xmath10 slit is @xmath1 37,000 ; for dddm  1 , which is nearly a point source ( b84 ) , the effective resolution can be roughly twice as high , under good seeing conditions .",
    "the spectra for dddm  1 are shown in fig . 1 ; the ionic lines are strong enough that they were clearly visible in each nod pair .",
    "we also attempted to measure 76 ( hu  @xmath5 ) in dddm  1 , but were only able to set an upper limit on the line flux .",
    "no lines were detected in h  4 - 1 ( fig .",
    "2 ) , and no continuum was detected for either object .",
    "line fluxes are summarized in table  1 .",
    "for dddm  1 we also utilized a high - dispersion , flux - calibrated spectrum obtained on the mcdonald observatory 2.7  m harlan j. smith telescope , using the 2d - coud white pupil cross - dispersed echelle spectrometer ( tull et al .",
    "dddm  1 was observed on 10 july 1995 for a total integration time of 1 hour ( 60 min ) at an air mass of x = 1.011.04 .",
    "unfortunately , we did not observe h  4 - 1 , so parameters determined from optical lines are taken from the literature for this object .",
    "the data were reduced using the echelle package in iraf .",
    "the spectrum was extracted over an effective area of 1.8@xmath10 ( slit width ) @xmath2 8@xmath10 ( length ) .",
    "a rough wavelength calibration was established by observing a thar lamp , although this is poorly constrained beyond 9000  where we did not have accurate wavelengths for the calibration lamp lines .",
    "there was no ambiguity , however , in identifying the intrinsically strong lines of interest .",
    "the spectral resolving power was r  @xmath1  60,000 ( 5  km  sec@xmath8 ) . at this resolution ,",
    "the nebular lines are clearly resolved .",
    "the ionic lines such as [ ] 4959   and 4363   have double - peaked profiles , with a shallow ( 1015% ) dip between two peaks of roughly equal strength separated by 20.5 @xmath13 0.3 km  s@xmath8 .",
    "the fwhm as measured from the half - power points on the extreme blue and red sides of the overall profile is 41.0 @xmath13 0.3 km  s@xmath8 .",
    "given the lower s / n for the infrared lines , their profiles ( fig .",
    "1 ) appear consistent with those of the optical lines .",
    "standard stars @xmath12 sgr ( hr  7121 ) and @xmath14 aql ( hr 7236 ) were used with fluxes from alekseeva et al .",
    "( 1996 ) to construct the response function for flux calibration .",
    "due to atmospheric absorption at the long - wavelength end ( @xmath14 @xmath4 7000  ) and crowding of balmer lines in the calibration stars at the short - wavelength end ( @xmath14 @xmath15 4000  ) , as well as the difficulty of accurately compensating for differential refraction over such a broad wavelength range , the flux ratios of lines at widely separated wavelengths are relatively uncertain .",
    "however , flux ratios of lines in the same order , or in adjacent orders for which the flux calibration can be checked or scaled in the overlap region , should be accurate to @xmath110%  or better , which is sufficient for our purposes . in practice ,",
    "we have used known intrinsic ratios of various lines to adjust the fluxes of other lines , and thereby infer additional line ratios ( see  3.1.2 ) .    the [ ] 9069   line , which we use below to derive the ionic abundance ratio n(s@xmath16)/n(h@xmath17 ) , deserves further comment . a slight asymmetry in its profile as compared to the profiles of other ionic lines ( see above ) indicates a modest amount of absorption by telluric h@xmath18o ; the red side of the double - peaked profile is diminished by about 20%  relative to the blue side , and the red half of the line profile is slightly narrower than the blue side . by comparing the blue half of the line profile with the red half , we estimate that the line flux has been decreased by 10% ; we apply this correction to yield the [ ] 9069   flux reported below .",
    "in order to compute ionic abundance ratios relative to hydrogen , we need a measure of the h@xmath19 emission .",
    "since the apertures used for the observations were large enough to include the entire nebula and the extinction is negligible , we use the total h@xmath20 flux for this comparison . from our optical spectrum of dddm  1",
    "we find f(h@xmath20 ) = ( 1.52@xmath130.03 ) @xmath2 10@xmath21 erg  @xmath22  s@xmath8 , in excellent agreement with b84 and clegg et al .",
    "( 1987 ; hereafter c87 ) , who give ( 1.51@xmath130.20 ) @xmath2 10@xmath21 and ( 1.45@xmath130.15 ) @xmath2 10@xmath21 erg  @xmath22  s@xmath8 respectively .",
    "the extinction towards this object is effectively zero ( c87 ) , so we make no extinction corrections to the line fluxes .",
    "we also need values for the nebular electron temperature and density in order to compute effective line emissivities .",
    "we adopted @xmath23 = 12,000 k and @xmath24 = 4 @xmath2 10@xmath25 @xmath26 , after bc84 and c87 .",
    "the density - sensitive flux ratio of the [ ] lines is measurable in our optical spectra , with both lines appearing in the same order , and we find f(6731 )/f(6716  ) = 1.63@xmath130.08 , consistent with the value of 1.7 found by these authors .",
    "the lines which constitute the temperature - sensitive [ ] ratio f(4959 )/f(4363  ) are separated by 10 echelle orders in our spectrum , so it is not advisable to take their ratio directly .",
    "the intrinsically weaker [ ] 4363    line lies in the same order as h@xmath27 , and our measured ratio of these lines , 0.084@xmath130.004 ( see table 2 for a summary of the relevant optical line flux ratios ) , is slightly lower than the values of 0.11 and 0.10 found by b84 and c87 respectively .",
    "however , we also find a slightly lower ratio of f ( [ ]  4959 )/h@xmath20 ( 1.10@xmath130.05 ) than these authors ( 1.41.5 respectively ) , so that after scaling by the intrinsic emissivity ratio of the h@xmath27/h@xmath20 ( 0.47 ; osterbrock 1989 ) , we derive f(4959 )/f(4363  ) @xmath1 28@xmath133 , whereas c87 and b83 find values of 3233 .",
    "thus , our results are reasonably consistent with previous temperature determinations .",
    "the calculated value for the effective collision strength of the [ s iv ] fine - structure line at 10.5 @xmath6 has increased dramatically over the past couple of decades , altering the interpretation of earlier work on s@xmath28 in pne ( e.g. dinerstein 1980a , 1980b ; beck et al . 1981 ) .",
    "at the present time , we have a more satisfactory situation , with the recent publication of two independent calculations which are in good agreement .",
    "the iron - project calculations of saraph & storey ( 1999 ) yield @xmath29(12,000 @xmath30 ) = 8.55 .",
    "the value reported by tayal ( 2000 ) for @xmath31 = 10,000 k , @xmath29 = 8.536 , is consistent with that of saraph & storey .    using this collision strength for the nebular parameters cited above , the density - normalized volume emissivity for the [ ] line is ( ah@xmath32f@xmath18)/@xmath24 = 4.6 @xmath2 10@xmath33 erg  cm@xmath25  s@xmath8 , where a is the transition probability , @xmath32 is the frequency of the emitted line , f@xmath18 is the fraction of ions in the upper level of the transition , and the other symbols have their usual meanings . from our line measurement ,",
    "this yields s@xmath28/h@xmath17 = ( 2.7@xmath130.2 ) @xmath2 10@xmath35 , where the error bar includes only the uncertainties in the infrared line flux .",
    "the central star of dddm  1 is relatively cool , similar to that of the m15 pn k648 .",
    "pea et al .",
    "( 1992 ) find @xmath36(dddm  1 ) = 40,000@xmath135000 k and @xmath36(k648 ) = 35,000@xmath135000 k from uv and optical measurements of the stellar continuum , while howard et al .",
    "( 1997 ) calculated photoionization models based on observations from the literature and found best - fit values of @xmath36 = 45,000 k for both objects . at these low stellar temperatures ,",
    "one expects that most of the sulfur would be doubly , not triply ionized .",
    "the [ ] lines at 9069 and 9531   are among the strongest lines in the echelle spectrum of dddm  1 .",
    "fortuitously , each line is paired with a recombination line of that appears in the same order : [ ] 9069 with 9015   ( pa  10 ) and [ ] 9531   with 9229   ( pa  9 ) .",
    "however , this region of the spectrum is severely affected by telluric h@xmath18o absorption , and the wavelength position of a particular line  which depends on both the object s intrinsic radial velocity shift and the date - dependent geocentric correction  becomes critical . at our high resolving power ,",
    "r @xmath1 60,000 , we can clearly see telluric absorption in the spectra of our calibration stars , and are therefore able to assess its impact on the line measurements . for the date of the dddm  1 observations , absorption by h@xmath18o had only a minor effect on the measured flux of [ ] 9069   ( see  2.2 above ) , but [ ] 9531   is severely affected , with part of the line profile falling in a region of essentially zero transmission by the atmosphere .",
    "we therefore use the measured ratio of f ( [ ] 9069 )/f ( pa  10 ) = 9.5@xmath130.09 , together with the [ ] and h@xmath20 emissivities from the web - based multi - atom program of shaw & dufour ( 1995 ) and the emissitivity ratio of pa  10/h@xmath20 from osterbrock ( 1989 ) , and derive s@xmath16/h@xmath17 = ( 1.63@xmath130.16 ) @xmath2 10@xmath37 .",
    "previously published values for s@xmath16/h@xmath17 were based on the weaker , more temperature - sensitive [ ] 6312   line : ( 2.3@xmath130.5 ) @xmath2 10@xmath37 ( b84 ) ; and 2.56 @xmath2 10@xmath37 ( c87 ) .",
    "unfortunately , this line is not present in our data because it falls in a gap between echelle orders .",
    "however , all of these values are consistent with the expectation that s@xmath16 is the dominant ionization stage of s in dddm  1 . consequently , the uncertainty in the total s / h abundance is dominated by the uncertainty in s@xmath16/h@xmath17 .",
    "not explicitly included in the cited errors is any systematic uncertainty due to the choice of atomic parameters a and @xmath29 ( we used values from mendoza & zeippen 1982 and galavis , mendoza , & zeippen 1995 ) .",
    "we derived the abundance of s@xmath19 from the ratio f ( [ ] 6731 )/f(h@xmath20 ) ( table 2 ) and the multi - level atom predictions of shaw & dufour ( 1995 ) , finding s@xmath19/h@xmath17 = ( 2.2@xmath130.2 ) @xmath2 10@xmath35 .",
    "( we were unable to use h@xmath5 , which lies closer in wavelength , because it fell too close to the edge of the echelle order . )",
    "this value is intermediate between those found by b84 ( 1.6 @xmath2 10@xmath35 ) and c87 ( 2.7 @xmath2 10@xmath35 ) and comparable to the amount of s@xmath28/h@xmath17 .",
    "thus , the data bear out our expectation that s@xmath16 is the dominant ion of s in dddm  1 .",
    "the total s / h abundance in dddm  1 summed over the three main ionization states ( table 3 ) is thus ( 2.1@xmath130.2 ) @xmath2 10@xmath37 .",
    "this is about an order of magnitude lower than s / h in typical disk pns but an order of magnitude higher than for the extreme halo pns bb  1 , k648 , and h  4 - 1 as measured from s@xmath17 and s@xmath16 ( barker 1983 ; also see discussion below ) .",
    "the s / o ratio is less sensitive than s / h to the adopted nebular parameters because of the similar temperature dependence of the line emissitivies . depending on whether we adopt o / h = 1.1 @xmath2 10@xmath3 ( b84 ) or o / h = 1.4 @xmath2 10@xmath3 ( c87 ) , we have s / o = 0.0150.019 .",
    "this is larger than values for disk pne found by kwitter & henry ( 2001 ) and milingo , henry , & kwitter ( 2002 ) , who give s / o = .012@xmath13.007 and .011@xmath13.006 respectively , but did not measure s@xmath28 . on the other hand ,",
    "our s / o is only slightly below the value of .021 , determined from iso measurements of fine - structure lines of both [ ] and [ ] , for a metal - poor extragalatic region which has similar o / h to that dddm  1 ( nollenberg et al .",

    "the abundance of ne@xmath16 was found to be ne@xmath16/h@xmath19 = 3 @xmath2 10@xmath37 by both hawley & miller ( 1978 ) and torres - peimbert & peimbert ( 1979 ) .",
    "our upper limit rules out the possibility of the elemental abundance being more than a factor of 2.6 larger , leaving previous conclusions about elemental abundance ratios in h  4 - 1 essentially unchanged .",
    "metal - poor galactic planetary nebulae are sufficiently rare that each discovery of a new example is regarded as noteworthy .",
    "currently there are only @xmath1 1012 objects considered to belong to this class ( pea et al .",
    "1992 ; howard et al .",
    "1997 ) , with 34 of these objects located in globular clusters ( pease 1928 ; gillett et al .",
    "1989 ; cohen & gillett 1989 ; jacoby et al .",
    "the deficit of pne in globular clusters has long been regarded as puzzling ( r. kraft 1976 , private communication ) .",
    "it may be a consequence of the details of the mass - loss process which creates an observable planetary nebula , which is not well understood .",
    "for example , low - metallicity stars may only produce pne with low masses ; the ionized masses of the pne in m  15 and m  22 are @xmath1 0.02 m@xmath48 ( see references above ) .",
    "another possibility is that the galactic globular clusters are too old , and hence their turn - off masses too low , to produce a visible pn via normal , single - star evolution , and a more exotic evolutionary channel such as binary interactions or coalescence is required to produce a pn ( jacoby et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 ; alves , bond , & livio 2000 ) .    a difficulty in unambiguously identifying a candidate object as a bona fide halo population pn is that the initial metallicity determination is usually based on o / h , since o produces some of the strongest emission lines in their spectra .",
    "there is an overall discrepancy or `` offset '' between most determinations of nebular o / h and the solar value , such that nebular analyses adopting the standard `` isothermal '' assumption yield derived o / h abundances of up to a factor of 23 lower than solar ( e.g. dinerstein 1990 ; peimbert 1995 ) .",
    "recent studies indicating a lower solar abundance , o / h @xmath1 5 @xmath2 10@xmath38 ( allende prieto , lambert , & asplund 2001 ) diminish but do not entirely remove this discrepancy . however , it has been well - established that the ratios of elements such as c , ar , and s to o vary dramatically among the halo population pne ( see references given in  1 ) . furthermore , the fact that the pn in m  15 , has o / h = 5 @xmath2 10@xmath38 , which corresponds to [ o / h ] = 1.2 in the usual `` bracket '' notation where [ o / h ] = log ( o / h )  log ( o / h)@xmath49 , while the stars in the parent cluster have [ fe / h ] = 2.2 ( harris & harris 2000 ) , reinforces the point that o / h may not be a reliable index of general metallicity",
    "this could be due either to internal enrichment or to a more rapid build - up of o as compared to the heavier @xmath5-capture and fe - group nuclei over galactic history ( barker 1980 ; torres - peimbert et al .",
    "1981 , and references therein ) .",
    "low - metallicity pne can also be found within the metal - poor stellar populations of local group galaxies such as the lmc and smc ( dopita et al .",
    "1997 ; jacoby & de marco 2002 ) .",
    "for the lmc sample , the heavier @xmath5-elements appear to be reliable indicators of metallicity .",
    "in particular , ne does not appear to be affected by internal processing and dredge - up .",
    "more recently , pquignot et al .",
    "( 2000a , b ) found evidence of oxygen self - enrichment in two pne belonging to the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy which is merging with the milky way , based on low values of ne / o , s / o , and ar / o which appear to result from elevated o / h .",
    "this agrees with the current picture that dredge - up processes are more efficient in metal - poor stars than in those of near - solar metallicity .",
    "tovmassian et al .",
    "( 2001 ) reported the discovery that the previously catalogued emission - line object sbs 1150 + 599a is an extremely oxygen - poor pn , now designated png 135.9 + 55.9 .",
    "this unusual object shares many of the characteristics of the high - ionization halo pne ngc 2242 and ngc 4361 , in which the lines are strong and is absent .",
    "the weakness of the [ ] 4959 , 5007   lines in ngc 2242 and 4361 is due primarily to ionization effects , and these objects have been interpreted as optically thin nebulae which are mass - bounded with the he@xmath16 zone ( garnett & dinerstein 1988 ; torres - peimbert , peimbert , & pea 1990 ; liu 1998 ) .",
    "follow - up studies of png 135.9 + 55.9 by richer et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and jacoby et al .",
    "( 2002 ) appear to confirm that the o / h abundance is low , @xmath15 .01 solar , although the exact value is somewhat model - dependent .",
    "the abundances of other elements are harder to establish : richer et al .",
    "find ne / o = 0.5@xmath130.3 , while jacoby et al . derive ne / o = 2.34.3 .",
    "the heavier @xmath5 elements ar and s are still more difficult , since in the optical they are represented only by lines that are weak or from minority ions .",
    "another possibility is that this object has experienced a separation of gas and dust leading to deficiencies in selected elements , an effect seen in some post - agb stars ( e.g. napiwotzki , heber , & kppen 1994 ) .",
    "clearly , png 135.9 + 55.9 deserves further attention .    the initial sample of galactic type iv pne , k648 , h  4 - 1 , bb  1 , and dddm  1 ,",
    "all have o / h within a factor of two of @xmath1 10@xmath3 , and the additional halo pne discovered subsequently also have o / h in this range .",
    "however , as discussed above , they show a wide dispersion in the ratios of heavier @xmath5-capture elements to o. from optical studies , bb  1 , k648 , and h  4 - 1 had been found to have very low values of s / o , while dddm 1 showed an s / o value similar to that of disk pne . in view of the fact that the correction for s@xmath28 from ionization models was uncertain , garnett & lacy ( 1993 ) addressed this issue empirically by searching for [ ] 10.5 @xmath6 in k648 and bb  1 .",
    "they failed to detect the line in either object , setting upper limits of s@xmath28/h@xmath19 @xmath15 1 @xmath2 10@xmath35 and 3 @xmath2 10@xmath35 for k648 and bb  1 respectively , and corresponding limits of s / o @xmath15 2 @xmath2 10@xmath41 and @xmath15 6 @xmath2 10@xmath41 .",
    "garnett & lacy interpreted these results in terms of elevated o rather than anomalously low s , and suggested that the enhancement in o / h is due to nucleosynthesis and mixing in the progenitor star .",
    "our observations supplement and extend those of garnett & lacy by including two additional halo pne : h  4 - 1 , which appears to belong to the same extremely metal - poor population as bb  1 and k648 ; and dddm  1 , which is characterized by relative abundances of s / o and ar / o similar to those of ordinary disk pne .",
    "we have also observed the `` missing '' ion of ne , which is a lower ionization potential stage ( ne@xmath17 ) in addition to the missing higher ionization stage of s ( s@xmath28 ) .",
    "the two objects in the present study are well matched in excitation and stellar temperatures to the two pne observed by garnett & lacy , with dddm  1 being similar to k648 and h  4 - 1 having similar excitation as bb  1 ( see  3.1.2 ) . with this more complete set of observations , the conclusion that there are two distinct types of metal - poor galactic pne seems inescapable .",
    "the planetary nebula populations of external galaxies are being tapped as valuable tracers of a number of chacteristics of their parent galaxies : as distance indicators through match - up of their luminosity functions ( e.g. jacoby et al . 1992 ) ; as kinematical tracers of the gravitational potential wells of the spheroids of external galaxies ( e.g. napolitano et al .",
    "2001 ) ; and even as metallicity indicators ( walsh et al . 2000 ) .",
    "however , it is becoming clear that o / h abundances in the pn gas are more strongly affected by self - enrichment than previously suspected .",
    "indeed , these processes may effectively set an abundance `` floor '' for o / h which erases any original one - to - one correlation between o / h and the abundances of heavier elements such as ar , s , and fe .",
    "this erasure is presumably responsible for the wide scatter in ratios such as ar / o and s / o among the halo pne ( pea et al .",
    "1992 ; howard et al .",
    "the moral to be drawn is that caution must be applied when using o / h as a generic abundance indicator for pne , particularly in low - metallicity parent populations ; it is of utmost importance than abundances be measured for elements heavier than the cno group , in order to establish the original composition of the their stellar progenitors .",
    "we have observed the fine - structure lines [ ] 10.5 @xmath6 and [ ] 12.8 @xmath6 in two pne with similarly low o / h abundances , o / h @xmath1 10@xmath3 ; these objects belong to the small sample of galactic pne comprising the class of halo population or type iv nebulae .",
    "we detect both lines in dddm  1 , and set upper limits on their fluxes in pn h  4 - 1 .",
    "these observations , combined with new ( for dddm  1 ) and previous ( h  4 - 1 ) optical data , confirm that these two objects have distinctly different patterns of heavy element abundances , despite their similar values of o / h , which has traditionally been regarded as a reliable indicator of metallicity in ionized nebulae . as others have previously suggested , it appears that h  4 - 1 , along with the similar objects k648 and bb  1 observed by garnett & lacy ( 1993 ) , has self - enriched its nebular gas with oxygen synthesized within the star . in these objects , it is the heavier elements such as s and ar which more accurately reflect the initial stellar composition .",
    "in contrast , dddm  1 has similar heavy - element ratios to those of disk pne , and represents a distinct , only modestly metal - poor population , to which several other recently discovered galactic halo pne ( e.g. m  2 - 29 , prgm  1 ) also belong .",
    "these results suggest that o / h should be approached with caution as an indicator of metallicity in metal - poor pne .",
    "the study of pne in external galaxies has been rapidly expanding , from their initial use as distance indicators , to kinematical tracers of galaxy potential wells and indicators of the composition of their parent populations .",
    "however , in view of the discussion above , it is possible that extremely low o / h values may be very rare even in pne from very metal - poor populations , because of efficient dredge - up and consequent self - enrichment .",
    "further studies of metal - poor pne , both in the galaxy and in external galaxies , will be very useful for clarifying this issue and for helping determine the extent to which lower - mass stars are significant sources of oxygen to the ism .",
