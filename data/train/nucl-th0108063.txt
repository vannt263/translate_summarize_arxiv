    "understanding how nuclear forces emerge from the fundamental theory of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is one of the most important problem of quantum physics . to study hadron dynamics at scales where qcd is strongly coupled ,",
    "it is useful to employ effective field theories ( eft s ) [ 1 ] being an invaluable tool for computing physical quantities in the theories with disparate energy scales . in order to describe low energy processes involving nucleons and pions , all possible interaction operators consistent with the symmetries of qcd",
    "are included in an effective lagrangian of an eft .",
    "however such a lagrangian leads to ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences that must be regulated and a renormalization scheme defined .",
    "a fundamental difficulty in an eft description of nuclear forces is that they are nonperturbative , so that an infinite series of feynman diagrams must be summed .",
    "summing the relevant diagrams is equivalent to solving a schrdinger equation .",
    "however , an eft yields graphs which are divergent , and gives rise to a singular schrdinger potential . for this reason",
    "n - nucleon potentials are regulated and renormalized couplings are defined [ 2 ] .",
    "nevertheless , a renormalization procedure does not lead to the potentials satisfying the requirements of ordinary quantum mechanics , and consequently after renormalization nucleon dynamics is not governed by the schrdinger equation .",
    "this raises the question of what kind of equation governs nucleon dynamics at low energies .",
    "the schrdinger equation is local in time , and the interaction hamiltonian describes an instantaneous interaction .",
    "this is the main cause of infinities in the hamiltonian formalism . in ref.[3 ] it has been shown that the use of the feynman approach to quantum theory [ 4 ] in combination with the canonical approach allows one to extend quantum dynamics to describe the evolution of a system whose dynamics is generated by nonlocal in time interaction .",
    "a generalized quantum dynamics ( gqd ) developed in this way has been shown to open new possibilities to resolve the problem of the uv divergences in quantum field theory [ 3 ] .",
    "an equation of motion has been derived as the most general dynamical equation consistent with the current concepts of quantum theory .",
    "being equivalent to the schrdinger equation in the particular case where interaction is instantaneous , this equation permits the generalization to the case where the interaction operator is nonlocal in time .",
    "note that there is one - to - one correspondence between nonlocality of interaction and the uv behavior of the matrix elements of the evolution operator as a function of momenta : the interaction operator can be nonlocal in time only in the case where this behavior is `` bad '' , i.e. in a local theory it leads to the uv divergences .",
    "for this reason one can expect the nucleon dynamics that follows from renormalization of an eft to be governed by the generalized dynamical equation with nonlocal - in - time interaction operator . in the present paper",
    "we investigate the problem of renormalization of dynamical equations which arises in the eft approach . in sec.ii",
    "we review the principal features of the gqd . in sec.iii , by using a toy model of the separable nn potential leading to logarithmic singularities in the born series , we show that renormalization gives rise to nucleon dynamics which is governed by the generalized dynamical equation with a nonlocal - in - time interaction operator .",
    "the dynamical situation that arises in a quantum system of nucleons after renormalization is investigated in sec.iv .",
    "we show that the t matrix obtained in ref.[5 ] by dimensional regularization of this model does not satisfy the lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) equation but satisfies the generalized dynamical equation with a nonlocal - in - time interaction operator . finally , in sec.v we present some concluding remarks .",
    "as has been shown in ref.[3 ] , the schrdinger equation is not the most general dynamical equation consistent with the current concepts of quantum theory .",
    "let us consider these concepts .",
    "as is well known , the canonical formalism is founded on the following assumptions :    \\(i ) the physical state of a system is represented by a vector ( properly by a ray ) of a hilbert space .",
    "\\(ii ) an observable a is represented by a hermitian hypermaximal operator @xmath0 .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath1 of @xmath0 give the possible values of a. an eigenvector @xmath2 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath1 represents a state in which a has the value @xmath1 .",
    "if the system is in the state @xmath3 the probability @xmath4 of finding the value @xmath1 for a , when a measurement is performed , is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the projection operator on the eigenmanifold @xmath7 corresponding to @xmath8 and the sum @xmath9 is taken over a complete orthonormal set @xmath10 ( s=1,2 , ... ) of @xmath11 the state of the system immediately after the observation is described by the vector @xmath12    in the canonical formalism these postulates are used together with the assumption that the time evolution of a state vector is governed by the schrdinger equation . however , in qft the schrdinger equation is only of formal importance because of the uv divergences .",
    "note in this connection that in the feynman approach to quantum theory this equation is not used as a fundamental dynamical equation .",
    "as is well known , the main postulate on which this approach is founded , is as follows [ 4 ] :    \\(iii ) the probability of an event is the absolute square of a complex number called the probability amplitude .",
    "the joint probability amplitude of a time - ordered sequence of events is product of the separate probability amplitudes of each of these events .",
    "the probability amplitude of an event which can happen in several different ways is a sum of the probability amplitudes for each of these ways .",
    "the statements of the assumption ( iii ) express the well - known law for the quantum - mechanical probabilities . within the canonical formalism this law",
    "is derived as one of the consequences of the theory . however , in the feynman formulation of quantum theory this law is used as the main postulate of the theory .",
    "the feynman formulation also contains , as its essential idea , the concept of a probability amplitude associated with a completely specified motion or path in space - time . from the assumption ( iii )",
    "it then follows that the probability amplitude of any event is a sum of the probabilities that a particle has a completely specified path in space - time .",
    "the contribution from a single path is postulated to be an exponential whose ( imaginary ) phase is the classical action ( in units of @xmath13 ) for the path in question .",
    "the above constitutes the contents of the second postulate of the feynman approach to quantum theory .",
    "this postulate is not so fundamental as the assumption ( iii ) , which directly follows from the analysis of the phenomenon of quantum interference . in ref.[3 ] it has been shown that the first postulate of the feynman approach ( the assumptions ( iii ) ) can be used in combination with the main fundamental postulates of the canonical formalism ( the assumptions ( i ) and ( ii ) ) without resorting to the second feynman postulate and the assumption that the dynamics of a quantum system is governed by the schrdinger equation . as has been shown , such a use of the main assumptions of quantum theory leads to a more general dynamical equation than the schrdinger equation .    in the general case the time evolution of a quantum system",
    "is described by the evolution equation @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the unitary evolution operator @xmath16 with the group property @xmath17 here we use the interaction picture . according to the assumption ( iii ) ,",
    "the probability amplitude of an event which can happen in several different ways is a sum of contributions from each alternative way . in particular ,",
    "the amplitude @xmath18 can be represented as a sum of contributions from all alternative ways of realization of the corresponding evolution process . dividing these alternatives in different classes",
    ", we can then analyze such a probability amplitude in different ways .",
    "for example , subprocesses with definite instants of the beginning and end of the interaction in the system can be considered as such alternatives . in this way",
    "the amplitude @xmath19 can be written in the form [ 3 ] @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the probability amplitude that if at time @xmath22",
    "the system was in the state @xmath23 then the interaction in the system will begin at time @xmath22 and will end at time @xmath24 and at this time the system will be in the state @xmath25 note that in general @xmath26 may be only an operator - valued generalized function of @xmath22 and @xmath27 [ 3 ] , since only @xmath28 must be an operator on the hilbert space . nevertheless , it is convenient to call @xmath29 an `` operator '' , using this word in generalized sense . in the case of an isolated system",
    "the operator @xmath29 can be represented in the form [ 3 ] @xmath30 @xmath31 being the free hamiltonian .    as has been shown in ref.[3 ] , for the evolution operator @xmath15 given by ( 3 ) to be unitary for any times @xmath32 and @xmath33 , the operator @xmath29 must satisfy the following equation :",
    "@xmath34 this equation allows one to obtain the operators @xmath26 for any @xmath22 and @xmath27 , if the operators @xmath35 corresponding to infinitesimal duration times @xmath36 of interaction are known .",
    "it is natural to assume that most of the contribution to the evolution operator in the limit @xmath37 comes from the processes associated with the fundamental interaction in the system under study . denoting this contribution by @xmath38 , we can write @xmath39 where @xmath40 . the parameter @xmath41 is determined by demanding that @xmath38 must be so close to the solution of eq.(5 ) in the limit @xmath42 that this equation has a unique solution having the behavior ( 6 ) near the point @xmath43.thus this operator must satisfy the condition @xmath44 note that the value of the parameter @xmath45 depends on the form of the operator @xmath46 since @xmath26 and @xmath38 are only operator - valued distributions , the mathematical meaning of the conditions ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) needs to be clarified .",
    "we will assume that the condition ( 6 ) means that @xmath47 for any vectors @xmath48 and @xmath49 of the hilbert space .",
    "the condition ( 7 ) has to be considered in the same sense .    within the gqd the operator @xmath38 plays the role which the interaction hamiltonian plays in the ordinary formulation of quantum theory",
    ": it generates the dynamics of a system . being a generalization of the interaction hamiltonian",
    ", this operator is called the generalized interaction operator .",
    "if @xmath38 is specified , eq.(5 ) allows one to find the operator @xmath50 formula ( 3 ) can then be used to construct the evolution operator @xmath15 and accordingly the state vector @xmath51 at any time @xmath52 thus eq.(5 ) can be regarded as an equation of motion for states of a quantum system . by using ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , the evolution operator can be represented in the form @xmath53 \\exp[i(z - e_{n_1})t_0 ] } { ( z - e_{n_2})(z - e_{n_1 } ) } \\nonumber\\\\   \\times < n_2|t(z)|n_1>,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 from ( 9 ) , for the evolution operator in the schrdinger picture , we get @xmath57 where @xmath58 eq.(11 ) is the well - known expression establishing the connection between the evolution operator and the green operator @xmath59 , and can be regarded as the definition of the operator @xmath59 .",
    "the equation of motion ( 5 ) is equivalent to the following equation for the t matrix [ 3 ] : @xmath60 with the boundary condition @xmath61 where @xmath62 @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the generalized interaction operator in the schrdinger picture .",
    "the solution of eq.(13 ) satisfies the equation @xmath65 this equation in turn is equivalent to the following equation for the green operator @xmath66 this is the hilbert identity , which in the hamiltonian formalism follows from the fact that in this case the evolution operator ( 11 ) satisfies the schrdinger equation , and hence the green operator is of the formr @xmath67 @xmath68 being the total hamiltonian . at the same time , as has been shown in ref.[3 ] , eq.(5 ) and hence eqs.(13 ) and ( 15 ) are unique consequences of the unitarity condition and the representation ( 3 ) expressing the feynman superposition principle ( the assumption ( iii ) ) .",
    "it should be noted that the evolution operator constructed by using the schrdinger equation can be represented in the form ( 3 ) [ 9 ] .",
    "being written in terms of the operators @xmath26 , eq.(5 ) does not contain operators describing interaction in the system .",
    "it is a relation for @xmath26 , which are the contributions to the evolution operator from the processes with defined instants of the beginning and end of the interaction in the systems .",
    "correspondingly eqs.(13 ) and ( 15 ) are relations for the t matrix .",
    "a remarkable feature of ( 5 ) is that it works as a recurrence relation , and to construct the evolution operator it is enough to now the contributions to this operator from the processes with infinitesimal duration times of interaction , i.e. from the processes of a fundamental interaction in the system .",
    "this makes it possible to use ( 5 ) as a dynamical equation .",
    "its form does not depend on the specific feature of the interaction ( the schrdinger equation , for example , contains the interaction hamiltonian ) . since eq.(5 ) must be satisfied in all the cases , it can be considered as the most general dynamical equation consistent with the current concepts of quantum theory .",
    "all the needed dynamical information contains in the boundary condition for this equation , i.e. in the generalized interaction operator @xmath38 . as has been shown in ref.[3 ] ,",
    "the dynamics governed by eq.(5 ) is equivalent to the hamiltonian dynamics in the case where the operator @xmath38 is of the form @xmath69 @xmath70 being the interaction hamiltonian in the interaction picture . in this case",
    "the state vector @xmath71 given by ( 8) satisfies the schrdinger equation @xmath72 the delta function @xmath73 in ( 18 ) emphasizes that in this case the fundamental interaction is instantaneous .",
    "thus the schrdinger equation results from the generalized equation of motion ( 5 ) in the case where the interaction generating the dynamics of a quantum system is instantaneous . at the same time , eq.(5 ) permits the generalization to the case where the interaction generating the dynamics of a quantum system is nonlocal in time [ 3,6 ] . in the general case ,",
    "the generalized interaction operator has the following form [ 7 ] : @xmath74 where the first term on the right - hand side of this equation describes the instantaneous part of the interaction generating the dynamics of a quantum system , while the term @xmath75 represents its nonlocal - in - time part . as has been shown [",
    "3,7 ] , there is one - to - one correspondence between nonlocality of interaction and the uv behavior of the matrix elements of the evolution operator as a function of momenta of particles : the interaction operator can be nonlocal in time only in the case where this behavior is `` bad '' , i.e. in a local theory it results in uv divergences . in ref.[9 ] it has been shown that after renormalization the dynamics of the three - dimensional theory of a neutral scalar field interacting through a @xmath76 coupling is governed by the generalized dynamical equation ( 5 ) with a nonlocal - in - time interaction operator .",
    "this gives reason to expect that after renormalization the dynamics of an eft is also governed by this equation with a nonlocal interaction operator .",
    "in the next section we will consider this problem by using a toy model of the separable nn interaction .",
    "let us consider the evolution problem for two nonrelativistic particles in the c.m.s .",
    "we denote the relative momentum by @xmath77 and the reduced mass by @xmath78 assume that the generalized interaction operator in the schrdinger picture @xmath79 has the form @xmath80 where @xmath81 is some function of @xmath82 and the form factor @xmath83 has the following asymptotic behavior for @xmath84 @xmath85 let , for example , @xmath83 be of the form @xmath86 and in the limit @xmath87 the function @xmath88 satisfies the estimate @xmath89 , where @xmath90 @xmath91 in the separable case , @xmath92 can be represented in the form @xmath93 correspondingly , @xmath94 is of the form @xmath95 where , as it follows from ( 13 ) , the function @xmath96 satisfies the equation @xmath97 with the asymptotic condition @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 the solution of eq.(21 ) with the initial condition @xmath101 where @xmath102 is @xmath103 in the case @xmath104 , the function @xmath96 tends to a constant as @xmath105 : @xmath106 thus in this case the function @xmath107 must also tend to @xmath108 as @xmath109 from this it follows that the only possible form of the function @xmath81 is @xmath110 where the function @xmath111 has no such a singularity at the point @xmath112 as the delta function . in this case",
    "the generalized interaction operator @xmath79 has the form @xmath113 and hence the dynamics generated by this operator is equivalent to the dynamics governed by the schrdinger equation with the separable potential @xmath114 solving eq.(21 ) with the boundary condition ( 25 ) , we easily get the well - known expression for the t matrix in the separable - potential model @xmath115    ordinary quantum mechanics does not permit the extension of the above model to the case @xmath116 indeed , in the case of such a large - momentum behavior of the form factors @xmath117 the use of the interaction hamiltonian given by ( 28 ) leads to the uv divergences , i.e. the integral in ( 29 ) is not convergent .",
    "we will now show that the generalized dynamical equation ( 5 ) allows one to extend this model to the case @xmath118 let us determine the class of the functions @xmath107 and correspondingly the value of @xmath119 for which eq.(21 ) has a unique solution having the asymptotic behavior ( 22 ) . in the case @xmath120 the function @xmath96 given by ( 24 ) has the following behavior for @xmath121 @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 with @xmath125 the parameter @xmath126 does not depend on @xmath127 this means that all solutions of eq.(21 ) have the same leading term in ( 29 ) , and only the second term distinguishes the different solutions of this equation .",
    "thus , in order to obtain a unique solution of eq.(21 ) , we must specify the first two terms in the asymptotic behavior of @xmath96 for @xmath128 from this it follows that the functions @xmath107 must be of the form @xmath129 and @xmath130 correspondingly , the functions @xmath81 must be of the form @xmath131 with @xmath132,$ ] and @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the gamma - function .",

    "let us now consider the case @xmath146 . in this case",
    "the uv behavior of the form factor @xmath147 gives rise to the logarithmic singularities in the born series .",
    "for @xmath148 the function @xmath96 given by ( 33 ) has the following asymptotic behavior : @xmath149 where @xmath150 and @xmath151 . from this",
    "it follows that the functions @xmath107 must be of the form @xmath152 and @xmath130 by using the fact that , as it follows from ( 23 ) and ( 34 ) , @xmath153 we can obtain the interaction operator @xmath154 thus , in the case of the uv behavior of the form factors corresponding to @xmath155 , the interaction operator @xmath79 necessarily has the form ( 35 ) , where for given @xmath156 only the parameter @xmath145 is free .",

    "the motivation to use such a model for parameterization of the nn forces is the fact that due to the quark and gluon degrees of freedom the nn interaction must be nonlocal in time .",
    "however , because of the separation of scales the system of hadrons should be regarded as a closed system , i.e. the evolution operator must be unitary and satisfy the composition law . from this",
    "it follows that the dynamics of such a system is governed by eq.(5 ) with nonlocal - in - time interaction . in ref.[7 ] the following form factor was used for parameterization of the nn interaction @xmath172 with @xmath173 @xmath174 being the yamaguchi form factor @xmath175 here @xmath176 @xmath177 and @xmath119 are some constants . being the generalization of the yamaguchi model [ 10 ] to the case where the nn interaction is nonlocal in time , our model yields the nucleon - nucleon phase shifts in good agreement with experiment ( see figs.(1 - 3 ) ) . however , the main advantage of this model , is that it allows one to investigate the effects of the retardation in the nn interaction caused by the existence of the quark and gluon degrees of freedom on nucleon dynamics .",
    "as we have seen , there is the one - to - one correspondence between the form of the generalized interaction operator and the uv behavior of the form factor @xmath178 in the case @xmath179 the operator @xmath79 would necessarily have the form ( 26 ) . in this case",
    "the fundamental interaction is instantaneous . in the case",
    "@xmath180 ( the restriction @xmath181 is necessary for the integral in ( 24 ) to be convergent ) , the only possible form of @xmath79 is ( 31 ) , and , in the case @xmath155 , it must be of the form ( 35 ) , and hence the interaction generating the dynamics of the system is nonlocal in time . thus the interaction generating the dynamics",
    "can be nonlocal in time only if the form factors have the `` bad '' large - momentum behavior that within hamiltonian dynamics gives rise to the ultraviolet divergences :    @xmath182    from this it follows that the quark - gluon retardation effects must results in the `` bad '' uv behavior of the matrix elements of the evolution operator as a function of momenta of hadrons .",
    "note that eft s lead to the same conclusion : within the eft approach the quark and gluon degrees of freedom manifest themselves in the form of lagrangians consistent with the symmetries of qcd which gives rise to the uv divergences .",
    "note also that eft s are local theories , despite the existence of the external quark and gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "however , renormalization of eft s gives rise to the fact that these theories become nonlocal .",
    "below this will be shown by using the example of our toy model .",

    "it is easy to see that , taking this limit , we get the expression ( 36 ) for @xmath96 .",
    "thus renormalization of the ls equation with the above singular potential leads to the t matrix we have obtained by solving eq.(13 ) with nonlocal - in - time interaction operator .",
    "this t matrix satisfies the generalized dynamical equation ( 13 ) , but does not satisfy the ls equation .",
    "correspondingly the schrdinger equation is not valid in this case .",
    "the strength of the potential @xmath199 tends to zero as @xmath198 , and consequently the renormalized interaction hamiltonian is also tend to zero .",
    "thus despite the fact that the dynamics of each theory corresponding to the dimension @xmath200 is hamiltonian dynamics for every @xmath201 , in the limiting case @xmath202 we go beyond hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "the dynamics of the renormalized theory is governed by the generalized equation of motion ( 5 ) with nonlocal - in - time interaction operator which in the case of the model under study is given by ( 35 ) .",
    "as we have shown , renormalization in the model , in which the nn interaction is described by the singular potential , leads to the fact that the dynamics of the system is governed by the generalized dynamical equation with a nonlocal - in - time interaction operator , and in this way we get the same results we have obtained by using the model constructed within the gqd ( in the case @xmath155 ) .",
    "this is not surprising .",
    "in fact , eq.(5 ) is a consequence of the most general physical principles , and must , for example , be satisfied in order that the evolution operator be unitary , and satisfy the composition law ( 2 ) . hence , the t matrix obtained by using a renormalization procedure must satisfy eq.(13 ) , provided this procedure leads to physically acceptable results , i.e. the theory is renormalizable . on the other hand the freedom in choosing the form of the interaction operator determining the boundary condition for eq.(5 )",
    "is limited by the condition ( 7),and , as we have seen , in the case of the form factors having the uv behavior ( 19 ) with @xmath155 , the interaction operator must be of the form ( 35 ) where only the parameter @xmath145 is free . however , in the case of the @xmath183 channel , this parameter is completely determined by demanding that the t matrix has a pole at energy @xmath203 .",
    "thus we have a unique interaction operator satisfying the above requirements , the use of which in the boundary condition ( 14 ) for eq.(13 ) leads to the same results as renormalization in the separable - potential model .",
    "the main results of the above analyzes of the dynamical situation in the model under study is that renormalization gives rice to the fact that the dynamics of a quantum system is governed by the generalized dynamical equation ( 5 ) with nonlocal - in - time interaction operator . in ref.[8",
    "] this fact has been shown , by using the example of the three - dimensional theory of a neutral scalar field interacting through a @xmath76 coupling .",
    "this gives reason to suppose that such a dynamical situation takes place in any renormalizable theory , for example , in an eft .",
    "below we will consider some general argument leading to this conclusion .",
    "let @xmath204 be the green operator of a renormalizable theory corresponding to the momentum cutoff interaction hamiltonian @xmath205 with renormalized constants .",
    "for every finite cutoff @xmath206 , the operator @xmath204 obviously satisfies the hilbert identity ( 16 ) @xmath207 at the same time , the renormalized green operator @xmath208 is a limit of the consequence of the operators @xmath204 for @xmath209 .",

    "as we have shown , this allows one to use eq.(5 ) and hence eq.(13 ) as dynamical equations : only in the case where the interaction operator is of the form ( 18 ) , i.e. the dynamics of the system is hamiltonian , the operator @xmath59 can be represented in the form ( 17 ) . for every finite cutoff @xmath206 the dynamics of the system",
    "is hamiltonian . at the same time , in the limiting case @xmath212 the dynamics is governed by the generalized dynamical equation with a nonlocal - in - time interaction operator , i.e. the dynamics is not hamiltonian .    in order to clarify the characteristic features of the dynamics generated by the nonlocal - in - time interaction ,",
    "let us come back to our toy model . in the schrdinger picture , the evolution operator @xmath213 of the model ( 33 ) can be rewritten in the form @xmath214 where @xmath215 is given by ( 32 ) . since",
    "this t matrix satisfies eqs.(13 ) and ( 15 ) , the evolution operator ( 33 ) is unitary , and satisfies the composition law ( 2 ) .",
    "correspondingly , the operator @xmath216 constitute a one - parameter group of unitary operators , with the group property @xmath217 assume that this group has a self - adjoint infinitesimal generator @xmath68 which in the hamiltonian formalism is identified with the total hamiltonian .",
    "then for @xmath218 we have @xmath219 from this and ( 41 ) it follows that @xmath220 where @xmath221 since @xmath215 is an analytic function of @xmath222 , and , in the case @xmath223 , tends to zero as @xmath224 , from ( 44 ) we get @xmath225 for any @xmath226 and @xmath227 , and hence @xmath228 .",
    "this means that , if the infinitesimal generator of the group of the operators @xmath216 exists , then it coincides with the free hamiltonian , and the evolution operator is of the form @xmath229 .",
    "thus , since this , obviously , is not true , the group of the operators @xmath216 has no infinitesimal generator , and hence the dynamics is not governed by the schrdinger equation .",
    "it should be also noted that in the case @xmath223 , @xmath29 is not an operator on the hilbert space . in fact , the function @xmath230 is not square integrable for any nonzero @xmath231 , because of the slow rate of decay of the form factor @xmath147 as @xmath232 .",
    "correspondingly , the t matrix given by ( 32 ) does not represent an operator on the hilbert space .",
    "however , as we have stated , in general @xmath29 may be only an operator - valued generalized function such that the evolution operator is an operator on the hilbert space .",
    "correspondingly , the t matrix must be such that @xmath59 given by ( 12 ) is an operator on the hilbert space . in our model , @xmath29 and the t matrix",
    "satisfy these requirements , since the evolution operator given by ( 33 ) and the corresponding @xmath59 are operators on the hilbert space . at the same time , in this case we go beyond hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "we have shown that after renormalization nucleon dynamics is governed by the generalized dynamical equation ( 5 ) with a nonlocal - in - time interaction operator .",
    "the analyzes of the dynamical situation arising due to the existence of the external quark and gluon degrees of freedom leads to the same conclusion .",
    "as we have shown by using our toy model , such a nonlocality of the nn interaction can have significant effects on the character of nucleon dynamics .",
    "as is well known , the dynamics of many nucleon systems depends on the off - shell properties of the two - nucleon amplitudes . for this reason ,",
    "let us consider the effects of the nonlocality of the nn interaction on these properties .    in the nonlocal case",
    ", the matrix elements of the evolution operator as functions of momenta do not go to zero at infinity so fast as it is required by ordinary quantum mechanics , and within the hamiltonian formalism this leads to the ultraviolet divergences .",
    "for example , in this case the two - nucleon amplitudes @xmath215 do not go to zero fast enough to make the faddeev equation well - behaved .",
    "note that the same problem arises in the eft approach .",
    "another consequence of nonlocality in time of the @xmath233 interaction is that for fixed momenta @xmath227 and @xmath226 the matrix elements @xmath215 tend to zero as @xmath234 , while , in the local case , they tend to @xmath235 in this limit . to illustrate this , we present in fig.4 the off - shell behavior of @xmath215 in the limit @xmath234",
    "thus , nonlocality in time of the @xmath233 interaction caused by the existence of the quark and gluon degrees of freedom gives rise to an anomalous off - shell behavior of the two - nucleon amplitudes .",
    "the off - shell properties of the amplitudes for the ordinary interaction operator and the operator containing the nonlocal term are qualitatively different .",
    "this is true even when the two interaction operators have approximately the same phase shifts .",
    "such a large variation in the off - shell behavior of the amplitudes , even when the interaction operators are identical on - shell , can have significant effects on three- and many - body results [ 10 ] .",
    "this gives reason to expect that the anomalous off - shell behavior of the two - nucleon amplitudes can also have significant effects on nucleon matter properties .",
    "by using the model of the separable nn potential which gives rise to logarithmic singularities in the born series , we have demonstrated that after renormalization the dynamics of a nucleon system is governed by the generalized dynamical equation ( 5 ) with a nonlocal in time interaction operator . by using eq.(16 )",
    "we have shown that this should be true in the general case . at the same time , being very simple and exactly solvable , the toy model allows one to investigate some characteristic features of the dynamics of a theory after renormalization .",
    "we have shown that the dynamical situation in the toy model which arises after renormalization is completely unsatisfactory from the point of view of the hamiltonian formalism : the group of the evolution operators @xmath216 has no infinitesimal generator , and hence the hamiltonian of the renormalized theory can not be defined .",
    "on the other hand , as has been shown in ref.[3 ] , the current concepts of quantum theory allow the extension of quantum dynamics to the case where the group of the evolution operator @xmath216 has no infinitesimal generator ( in this case the interaction generating the dynamics of a system is nonlocal in time ) .",
    "the schrdinger equation is only a particular case of the generalized dynamical equation ( 5 ) derived as a consequence of the most general principles of quantum theory , and there are no reasons to restrict ourselves to the local case where the interaction is instantaneous and the evolution operator has an infinitesimal generator .",
    "moreover , in quantum field theory such a restriction gives rise to the uv divergences , and , as has been shown , after renormalization the dynamics of a theory is not hamiltonian . at the same time",
    ", we have shown that such a dynamics is governed by the generalized dynamical equation ( 5 ) with a nonlocal - in - time interaction operator .",
    "this means that the gqd provides the extension of quantum dynamics which is needed for describing the evolution of quantum systems within a renormalized theory .",
    "this gives reason to hope that the use of the gqd and parameterization of the nn forces like ( 35 ) can open new possibilities for applying the eft approach to the description of low - energy nucleon dynamics . by using an eft",
    ", one can construct the generalized interaction operator consistent with the symmetries of qcd .",
    "this operator can then be used in eq.(5 ) for describing nucleon dynamics . note that in this case regularization and renormalization are needed only on the stage of determining the generalized interaction operator . after",
    "this one does not face the problem of uv divergences .",
