    "black hole horizons continue to baffle physicists at the quantum level , especially in light of the recent firewall paradox ( see e.g. @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite ) .",
    "+ partly motivated by this , there has been a recent renewed interest in better understanding black hole horizons within quantum gravity @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . also within string theory",
    "specifically , multiple ideas have been explored . in @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite",
    ", a new massless mode was studied that lives on the euclidean geometry close to the tip of the cigar .",
    "this mode is absent in field theory . in @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , we interpreted this mode as the thermal scalar field representing the dominant contribution to the thermal string gas surrounding the black hole horizon .",
    "the cigar theory was further studied recently in @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . in @xcite@xcite@xcite ,",
    "real - time aspects of strings near horizons were discussed ( non - adiabatic string production and elongation of strings falling near a black hole horizon ) .",
    "long strings were also argued to be very important in between both horizons of rotating black holes in @xcite@xcite .",
    "all of these works have in common that they focus on aspects of strings near black holes that differ from the naive field theory extrapolation .",
    "+ in this paper , we will highlight yet another one of these aspects .",
    "we aim at describing manifestly non - interacting strings in euclidean rindler space and its conical orbifolds . on conical spaces ,",
    "this description is obscured even in field theory .",
    "it has been known for quite some time that computing the one - loop vacuum amplitude for free fields on a conical space can yield negative contributions to the entropy , associated to a surface term on the black hole horizon @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "this peculiarity arises only for spins @xmath0 and obscures a thermodynamic interpretation .",
    "it is closely related to the difficulty in defining entanglement entropy in lattice gauge theories , a topic that is attracting a lot of attention recently , see e.g. @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . + in either of these contexts , one encounters a surface contribution that represents the entanglement of the so - called _ edge states _ attached to the entangling surface .",
    "hence , within this context , the total partition function splits in a natural way in a piece that does not contain the surface terms and a piece consisting of solely these terms .",
    "+ susskind and uglum looked at the analogous question for closed strings and illustrated that negative contributions can arise from worldsheets that intersect the origin in euclidean rindler space @xcite .",
    "these were interpreted in real - time as emission and reabsorption processes with emergent open strings whose endpoints are stuck at the horizon .",
    "the qft and string case were argued to be manifestations of the same phenomenon , for which some evidence was gathered @xcite .",
    "however , the full equality of these features has not been demonstrated .",
    "+ very recently , the authors of @xcite provided a new powerful technique to compute an arbitrary higher spin partition function on a conical space .",
    "moreover , they demonstrate that the open string partition function is of precisely this same form , upon summing over the string spectrum .",
    "this allows a more direct comparison between the surface contributions of fields , and the analogous origin - intersecting worldsheet contributions of strings .",
    "also the larger question on if and how string theory can be looked at as simply a sum over field theories can be addressed .",
    "+ secondly , the method also allows a clear distillation of the surface contributions from the  normal \" part . extracting only the latter , and then summing over the string spectrum , one obtains candidate string partition functions that are manifestly related to the sum over their field content",
    ". we will explore this road throughout this work .",
    "+ our final goal will be to get indications on whether this procedure done at the level of the states in the string spectrum , can really be identified with string partition functions that exclude worldsheets that intersect the origin ( figure [ schematic ] ) .        throughout this work we attempt to better understand if and how the contact terms are encoded within string theory as worldsheets that intersect the black hole horizon .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , several consistency checks can be done for the remainder of the partition functions .",
    "+ firstly , once horizon - intersecting worldsheets are excluded , the remainder should have a conventional thermodynamic interpretation ( e.g. no peculiar negative contributions to the entropy ) .",
    "+ secondly , winding number and discrete momentum around the origin should be good quantum numbers , since one can now define wrapping numbers of the worldsheet in a clean fashion .",
    "+ thirdly , if good string theory models can be built in this way , the open and closed string sectors should be related by worldsheet duality .",
    "+ finally , for closed strings one needs modular invariance in order to have a consistent torus interpretation .",
    "+ our main effort throughout this work will be to try to establish these results and hence demonstrate that mathematically one can make sense of the theory that excludes horizon - intersecting worldsheets .",
    "+ on a related note , it is interesting to think about the proposal made by solodukhin in @xcite concerning the equality between black hole entropy and entanglement entropy .",
    "he proposed that the tree - level contribution matches the sum of the contact terms at one loop , up to a sign .",
    "this would cause the black hole entropy ( up to one loop ) to be fully equal to the entanglement entropy of the fields and be manifestly positive . when applying this proposal in string theory , these are precisely the partition functions that we will construct here , and we will argue that within perturbative string theory such a mechanism does not seem viable . + the partition functions we will construct in this way by dropping contact terms , experience a thermal divergence that can be associated to a maximal acceleration of string theory . maximal acceleration was argued to be a general feature of any consistent theory of quantum gravity in the past @xcite .",
    "the arguments are however based on local considerations which makes applying them to string theory questionable .",
    "+ a naive argument to do expect this in string theory is as follows .",
    "the local unruh temperature around a black hole increases all the way to infinity .",
    "when it crosses the hagedorn temperature , the supposedly ultimate temperature in nature , the strings can not be in equilibrium anymore and they fall into the black hole . a slightly more refined argument was given in @xcite , where the authors argue that a detector emersed in the hagedorn heat bath at string length from the horizon , would be seen by inertial observers as emitting long strings .",
    "this would provide a mechanism for energy loss and would prevent a further acceleration . + a much more elaborate indication of this effect , was given in @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , where explicit computations were carried out .",
    "the strategy was to compute a property of a massive scalar in rindler space ( the propagator or the stress tensor vev ) , and then sum over the complete string spectrum to obtain the string theory result , while ignoring possible spin - dependence .",
    "a divergence was found in each case , that can be interpreted as a maximal acceleration .",
    "of course , the strategy has been to sum over the complete string spectrum while _ assuming _ higher spin fields just behave as several copies of massive scalars .",
    "this has been a general strategy in string theory , ever since its conception .",
    "+ to put these considerations in another perspective , consider the celebrated computation by polchinski in @xcite , in which he showed that the free energy of a string gas in flat space can be viewed as the sum of the free energies of the particles in the string spectrum .",
    "a hidden assumption here is that for each higher spin field , one can utilize the same expression for the free energy . for flat space , of course",
    ", this works out nicely .",
    "this strategy is doomed to fail for a black hole , since the surface interactions with the horizon ensure a non - trivial difference between the fields of different spin : one would need to know the free energy of every field in the string spectrum explicitly , before attempting the summation over the spectrum .",
    "+ on a larger level , despite the fact that we expect quantum horizons to be only fully understood in a non - perturbative treatment , we believe it is worthwhile to further investigate the perturbative story as well , since many features of perturbative string theory in a black hole geometry are still ill - understood and a detailed study of them has already lead to some surprising conclusions in the past .",
    "+ with our interest on thermodynamics in mind , it is useful to first set the stage .",
    "all expressions for partition functions @xmath1 we will write down are for _ single _ particle loops ( or string loops ) on the thermal manifold .",
    "as is well known , a simple exponentiation gives the field theory vacuum amplitude where an arbitrary number of vacuum loops are included .",
    "this single particle partition function has an expansion into a vacuum part and a thermal part .",
    "the vacuum part follows formally by taking the @xmath2 limit of the partition function .",
    "our focus in this work , is on the remaining thermal part . within closed string theory ,",
    "the full partition function and the vacuum part are both separately modular invariant .",
    "this requires the thermal part to be modular invariant on its own .",
    "even more so , the thermodynamic entropy @xmath3 where @xmath4 also needs to be modular invariant .",
    "one of our main goals is to explicitly verify this modular invariance of our candidate non - interacting thermal partition functions .",
    "we will write down most of our results for general @xmath5 .",
    "if one is interested in rindler thermodynamics , one should take @xmath6 in the end .",
    "+ a gas of non - interacting bosonic matter _ in any space _ at temperature @xmath7 has for its free energy : @xmath8 for spacetime fermions , one has instead @xmath9 if the theory is spacetime supersymmetric , @xmath10 and the total free energy becomes : @xmath11 which implies sectors with @xmath12 even are absent .",
    "hence the characteristic factor of @xmath13 is one of the signatures of spacetime supersymmetry in thermodynamical quantities .",
    "the modular invariants we will construct for type ii and heterotic strings will indeed include such a factor . + a further immediate property ( well - known in flat space ) is that @xmath14 and @xmath15 for non - interacting matter .",
    "+ this paper is structured as follows . in section [ intuition ]",
    "we provide an intuitive argument to show that open strings stuck at the horizon are important for black holes , even in the lorentzian case . while we do not build upon this argument in the remainder , it is instructive to keep it in mind when tempted to dismiss the exotic open - closed interactions as a non - physical feature only occuring on the thermal manifold .",
    "section [ ospf ] recapitulates the work of @xcite with a particular emphasis on the field content of the open string partition functions .",
    "we provide a detailed comparison and an interpretation of the higher spin surface contributions in string language . starting with section [ closedsectio ] ,",
    "we take a look at closed strings .",
    "firstly , we will prove that surface terms of the higher spin fields in the spectrum can not be the end of the story in that case .",
    "section [ wsdual ] provides a first attempt at non - interacting closed strings , by utilizing worldsheet open - closed duality to make some statement about closed strings .",
    "we also extend this computation to type ii superstrings and we find similar conclusions .",
    "the main part of this work , section [ moddinv ] , discusses the construction of non - interacting closed string partition functions for bosonic , type ii and heterotic strings .",
    "a particular emphasis is placed on modular invariance of these partition functions and the relation with earlier work by emparan @xcite .",
    "section [ secdiv ] contains a detailed analysis on the interpretation of the ir divergence that arises in the partition functions for each string type .",
    "we end with a conclusion and outlook in [ concl ] .",
    "some technical details are included in the appendix , as well as several formulas on the fixed winding heat kernels on flat cones .",
    "before delving into the computations , we would like to give a qualitative argument showing that the exotic open - closed interactions on the euclidean black hole horizon envisaged by susskind and uglum , actually are very important in real time as well .",
    "to that end , it is instructive to recapitulate a basic physical argument in favor of the unruh effect @xcite",
    ". suppose we coordinatize our flat metric as @xmath16 the coordinate frame is shown below in figure [ topsidee ] .",
    "rindler space covers only a quarter of 2d minkowski space .",
    "constant rindler time slices ( i.e. constant @xmath17 ) are semi - infinite lines originating at the origin .",
    "the infinite past ( @xmath18 ) and infinite future ( @xmath19 ) in rindler time are the two diagonal lines drawn in the figure . + as is well known , an accelerating observer in flat space experiences the minkowski vacuum as being thermally populated . an intuitive account for this effect",
    "can be given by explaining how the accelerating observer describes the vacuum fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the heat bath seen by the rindler observer arises because of eternal vacuum fluctuations as shown in figure [ topsidee ] ( a ) .            the vacuum loop that encircles the origin is the relevant one to describe the unruh heat bath .",
    "it is viewed by a fiducial observer as being eternal : the vacuum fluctuations close to the rindler origin are no longer virtual .",
    "the analogous torus diagrams in string theory have been drawn in figure [ topsidee ] ( b ) .",
    "+ in string theory however , a second set of embeddings is possible , leading to an open string gas with fixed endpoints on the horizon as shown in figure [ topside2 ] .",
    "as mentioned above , this intuitive account of the unruh effect actually contains much of the basic physical principles at work here . and",
    "it clearly demonstrates the relevance of _ open _ strings when considering the heat bath created by the closed string minkowski vacuum .",
    "usually , open string theory requires closed string theory to make sense of its interactions .",
    "now it is apparent that a black hole horizon also requires the opposite to be true : closed string theory requires open strings .",
    "+ the remainder of the results of this work focus on the thermal ( euclidean ) theory , but it is interesting to keep the intuition developed in this section in mind when contemplating the physical relevance of these open strings .",
    "a general way of studying string theory on a flat cone is to consider orbifolding the plane using a @xmath20 subgroup of @xmath21 . for string theory ,",
    "such discrete cones are apparently the only ones where a consistent modular invariant partition function is known .",
    "afterwards , to study thermodynamics , one performs a continuation in the variable @xmath5 to a real number . + within qft , one can also perform this orbifolding procedure , but one is also free to simply study the field theory on a generic cone directly and avoid the artificial orbifolding .",
    "this for instance allows a description directly in terms of a wrapping number of particle paths around the conical singularity .",
    "+ for the special @xmath20 cones , both descriptions should agree of course .",
    "+ the logic throughout this work will be to start with string theory on the @xmath20 cones , and link it to its description in terms of the fields in the spectrum .",
    "each higher spin field in the spectrum contains a  normal \" part and a surface part .",
    "we will remove the surface part and study the remainder .",
    "fermions with the appropriate high level degeneracy of states .",
    "we remark that for the entropy it has been pointed out ( see e.g. @xcite ) that fermions do not contain a contact term : only bosonic fields do . ]",
    "the latter partition function allows us to take @xmath5 a real number immediately .",
    "this construction will be shown to yield modular invariant partition functions .",
    "+ in this section , we will start by taking a closer look at the open string partition function as obtained through summing all fields in the spectrum .      in @xcite",
    ". wrote down the ( single - particle ) partition function of a _ generic _ higher spin bosonic field of mass @xmath12 on the flat cone @xmath22 as @xmath23 upon subtracting the @xmath24 contribution ( which is independent of the conical angle ) . the number @xmath25 denotes the spin of the @xmath21 subgroup of @xmath26 in the 2d plane of the cone .",
    "+ or upon integrating over @xmath27 : @xmath28 the thermodynamic entropy can be readily found as @xmath29 . + for instance",
    ", for a spin-@xmath30 field , one obtains @xmath31 after subtracting the non - thermal part and making use of the sum : @xmath32    for open bosonic strings , the partition function on @xmath22 can be written down as well as @xmath33 where in the second line we have set @xmath34 .",
    "+ the string expression ( [ obspf ] ) can be directly compared to the field expression ( [ ftspf ] ) . upon expanding the dedekind @xmath35 functions in a power series as well ,",
    "this identifies @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the open string oscillator number of the 24 oscillators ( of which two are in the conical plane ) .",
    "the @xmath21 spin of each state can then be identified as @xmath38    of course , we still need to check that the combinatorics work out , i.e. that every state we construct is really represented in the above string construction . as a simple example of this point , consider the case where the exponent @xmath39 equals @xmath40 .",
    "the number of such terms is the number of partitions of @xmath40 .",
    "there are several options for creating this : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 or @xmath45 . in terms of states",
    ", we have : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 . and @xmath51 denote the 2d plane with the conical singularity . ]",
    "the first two options have spin @xmath52 .",
    "the final three states carry spin @xmath40 or spin @xmath30 , where only 1 linear combination carries spin @xmath30 : @xmath53 .",
    "this is indeed also the case for @xmath54 . + it turns out that we should interpret @xmath55 as counting @xmath56 and @xmath57 as counting @xmath58 , and indeed , this is how string partition functions on cones are typically computed in the first place : by combining the fields as @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xcite@xcite . + in appendix [ app1 ]",
    ", we illustrate this for level @xmath61 and then demonstrate that it is generally true at any level . hence summing the particle partition function over the full string spectrum",
    "gives precisely the above string partition function .",
    "+ the particle partition functions however contain surface terms at higher spin .",
    "the open string partition function on the other hand contains exotic configurations where an open string pierces the horizon , interpreted as an open string emitting and reabsorbing another open string ( figure [ openexotic ] ) .        the conventional thermodynamic contribution on the other hand consists of open strings that do not intersect the origin , such as those displayed in figure [ opennormal ] .",
    "the reason that this configuration is manifestly equal to the non - interacting thermal trace @xmath62 , is that it can simply be described as an open string moving a distance @xmath63 in euclidean time and then reidentifying the configuration .",
    "the only unknown here is the open string rindler hamiltonian @xmath64 , which performs a time translation of an open string .",
    "but one does not need to know it explicitly to ensure this interpretation ; its existence is sufficient .",
    "+ now , due to the equality between the sum - over - fields approach and the full string result , we conclude that _ surface contributions to the higher spin fields can be identified in string language as the exotic open string interaction diagrams where the cylinder worldsheet pierces the horizon .",
    "_ this is the interpretation as suggested quite some time ago by kabat @xcite , but the above results make this much more explicit for open strings .",
    "a puzzle that arises then is that , since the lorentzian computation ( tracing over fixed energy states in a canonical ensemble ) should always match the euclidean computation , how do these fixed open strings influence the @xmath65 behavior of the lorentzian string gas .",
    "apparently , their influence must also be felt in that language . and",
    "indeed , the argument presented in the previous section , although qualitative , shows that also in that language these open strings are important . ] + this also demonstrates that the correct density of states ( the same as in flat space ) has been utilized here : for every single field on ( lorentzian ) rindler space , we compute the heat kernel . finally summing these _ with the flat space density of states _ agrees precisely with the conical partition function of open string theory .",
    "+ now , let us turn to the manifestly non - interacting partition function , where we drop these strange surface interactions . from the particle heat kernels ,",
    "it is clear that these contributions arise from the spin - dependent parts .",
    "one can hence turn off these contributions by simply removing the spin - dependent exponential in the heat kernels ( [ ftspf ] ) . note that this procedure makes the partition function larger : the surface contributions are of negative sign in @xmath1 .",
    "they hence contribute positively to the free energy ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the same negativity of the surface interactions is true for the entropy @xmath66 for any higher spin field as can be seen in the work of @xcite .",
    "within string theory , this procedure translates into the removal of the same factor . for open bosonic strings ,",
    "one obtains for instance : @xmath67      the extension to fermionic fields was also given in @xcite .",
    "the authors wrote down a formula combining both bosonic and fermionic fields as : @xmath68 only odd @xmath5 are allowed in this formula , since fermionic fields only have an orbifold interpretation in this case .",
    "for an elementary spin-@xmath69 field for instance , one finds @xmath70 upon subtracting the non - thermal part .",
    "the relevant sum that was performed here is given by @xmath71 hence this recovers the old result that each majorana component of a 2d spinor contributes half as much as a real scalar ( [ spin0z ] ) .",
    "kabat indeed proved that a spin-@xmath69 2-component spinor has the same thermal entropy as a real scalar in rindler space @xcite .",
    "+ also the open superstring partition function can be written down and compared to its particle content .",
    "this was done in @xcite and we will refrain at this point from making any more detailed checks ( we come back to this partition function further on ) .",
    "+ just as for bosonic higher spin fields , where we drop all spin - dependent parts and effectively reduce them to scalars , we will do the same with higher spin fermionic fields and treat them as spin-@xmath69 fermions , which have no surface interactions .",
    "it is by now clear that the open string entropy can be viewed as a sum of the field theory entropies of all the states in the spectrum .",
    "our goal is to do the same analysis for closed strings .",
    "however , the string partition functions themselves that can be constructed as @xmath72 orbifolds do not lend themselves to an analogous comparison @xcite .",
    "the reason is the second quantum number ( next to @xmath73 ) that is summed over , for which a direct thermal interpretation is more difficult to make .",
    "in fact , the partition functions turn out to be different as we now illustrate . + the bosonic closed string partition function on the @xmath20 orbifold can be written down as @xmath74 on the other hand , the sum of fields approach yields @xmath75 which is basically simply the square of the open string partition function ( [ obspf ] ) .",
    "the difference is the second sum over @xmath76 and the difference in integration region over either the fundamental domain or the entire strip .",
    "the big question is now whether the expressions ( [ fundpf ] ) and ( [ stripf ] ) could be equal .",
    "one can readily prove here that this is impossible for any finite @xmath5 .",
    "if the range of all of the summations were infinite , then one could immediately use the standard unfolding theorem .",
    "the finite range obscures the question at hand , and makes it indeed improbable for something similar to succeed .",
    "+ the proof proceeds by trying to apply the mcclain - roth - obrien - tan theorem @xcite@xcite as much as possible .",
    "we hence start in the modular fundamental domain and try to build up the strip domain by applying suitable modular transformation to the @xmath77 sectors .",
    "this can be formulated in a mathematical language as a build - up of not the entire strip , but instead of ( parts of ) the fundamental domain for the hecke congruence subgroups @xmath78 of the modular group .",
    "this was studied previously in @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "this is done explicitly for several low values of @xmath5 in appendix [ hecke ] .",
    "these domains are never equal to the full strip ( except for @xmath79 ) and hence the above partition functions ( [ fundpf ] ) and ( [ stripf ] ) can not be equal . + the difference however , can be interpreted as coming from the small @xmath80 uv region , and much like the cosmological constant in closed string theory , it appears that string theory also handles the uv in a different fashion for conical entropies .",
    "+ the detailed comparison done in appendix [ hecke ] also shows that the sum - over - fields approach actually hugely overcounts the stringy result .",
    "every torus configuration is counted an infinite number of times .",
    "the way this happens is quite analogous to the vacuum energy in flat space closed string theory : in that case the sum - over - fields approach gives a modular invariant but integrated over the strip domain .",
    "this domain can then be folded into the fundamental domain , but an overall infinity is included in the process ( basically counting the number of images of the fundamental domain that lie within the strip ) due to the immense overcounting of the tori within field theory . whether one still calls this partition function modular invariant is only a matter of taste ; it is pathological and infinitely large when trying to interpret it as a modular invariant integrated over the fundamental domain .",
    "+ we would like to point out the difference between this situation and the flat space closed string case .",
    "for flat space , the free energy ( and entropy ) of the string gas is nicely given by the sum of the free energies ( or entropies ) of the fields in the spectrum ; the discrepancy between string and field theory only occurs for the non - thermal vacuum energy part . for the conical manifolds ( and hence the approach to rindler entropy )",
    ", it also seems to happen for the thermal part .",
    "it would be interesting to have a deeper understanding of the above feature , but we will take a more pragmatic approach in the remainder of this work . + an indirect way of saying something about closed strings is through open - closed duality . using this ,",
    "one can at least obtain information on the conformal weights of closed strings on the same space .",
    "this is the approach we will utilize in this section .",
    "let us first look at the full open bosonic string partition function ( [ obspf ] ) .",
    "worldsheet ( open - closed ) duality can be used in the standard fashion : one transforms @xmath81 and then analyzes the large @xmath82 limit .",
    "one finds an expansion where all closed string states appear propagating along the cylinder .",
    "the theta - function has the property @xmath83 and one finds for the most dominant closed string state propagating in the closed twist @xmath73 channel : @xmath84 which is indeed the most dominant closed string tachyon of twist @xmath73 @xcite@xcite . as we expect",
    ", worldsheet duality tells us something about the conformal weights of the states .",
    "+ next we try to do the same thing for the partition function for which the surface contributions have been deleted . dropping the spin - dependent exponent ,",
    "one recovers the pure thermal ( non - interacting ) contribution .",
    "it is worthwile to rewrite expression ( [ nonintpf ] ) a bit . for the open string partition function",
    ", one can arrive there by replacing @xmath85 in the first line of equation ( [ obspf ] ) , which basically eliminates the spin - dependent exponentials in the expansion written above .",
    "+ one can write down an expression for the resulting non - interacting partition function by defining @xmath86 as the @xmath87-function with the sine factor removed : @xmath88 then we can write : @xmath89 note that there is a thermal contribution @xmath90 and a non - thermal one @xmath91 . + again doing the worldsheet duality , one instead finds @xmath92 for any @xmath73 , showing that it is the closed string tachyon that propagates most dominantly , _ even in the twisted channels_. the non - interacting partition function hence diverges for bosonic strings .",
    "the divergence is independent of the twisted sector @xmath73 .",
    "this derivation of the most dominant closed string state evades having to contemplate the density of states for closed strings ( presumably the same as for flat space ) .      the extension to superstrings is readily made . in green - schwarz language",
    ", the open superstring partition function equals @xmath93 performing worldsheet duality again , one finds for large @xmath82 : @xmath94 hence one arrives at @xmath95 in this green - schwarz language , the sectors with @xmath96 will correspond to the oddly twisted ones in the rns language , whereas the sectors with @xmath97 are evenly twisted . using the riemann identity and a shifting of @xmath76 and @xmath12 in the _",
    "closed _ string partition function , these indeed get redistributed into even and odd sectors in the rns superstring language @xcite@xcite . +",
    "this dominant closed string propagating state is again well - known and is the most dominant state in the twisted sectors .",
    "+ the non - interacting partition function for open superstrings can be found quite analogously as above .",
    "one relies heavily on formulas derived in @xcite to obtain this .",
    "we include the relevant formulas for reference in appendix [ openapp ] .",
    "after performing the sum of the twisted sectors @xmath73 , one obtains @xmath98 in fact , @xmath99 .",
    "hence @xmath100 which will be consistent with the non - interacting _ closed _ string partition function we will construct below . + since for large @xmath82 , @xmath101 we get for the most dominant contribution of type ii closed superstring propagation : @xmath102 which is again the closed string tachyon .",
    "hence , even closed type ii superstrings have a divergent non - interacting partition function in the twisted sectors .",
    "note that tachyons in the twisted sectors can be interpreted as thermal tachyons , which are relevant for thermodynamics .      as a further application of the open - closed duality",
    ", we here explain that this leads to the conclusion that all winding numbers must be present in the closed string spectrum of the non - interacting partition function .",
    "+ we focus here on the @xmath103 limit , although a generic conical deficit does not alter any of our conclusions .",
    "we have in mind here the decomposition of the partition function into the different wrapping numbers around the polar origin ; the link of the orbifolding procedure and its twisted sectors ( labeled by @xmath104 ) with the actual wrapping numbers is a bit more difficult to make and we do not focus on this here .",
    "we elaborate on this link further on .",
    "+ the polar origin represents a topological defect around which string worldsheets can wrap .",

    "several important comments are in order .",
    "* the fact that the non - interacting thermal entropy diverges for bosonic , type ii and heterotic superstrings resonates with the fact that the non - interacting sum - over - states quantities are expected to experience maximal acceleration phenomena : it is impossible to have an arbitrarily high acceleration for a single particle or string @xcite@xcite .",
    "we will come back to this in the next section . *",
    "the modular invariants make clear that all windings contribute equally to the divergence , a property which has been discovered by parentani and potting several years ago @xcite .",
    "* the @xmath161 is indicative that this quantum number @xmath12 is indeed the correct one , since spacetime supersymmetric partition functions should contain this .",
    "the reader might be puzzled at this point , since we are discussing conical manifolds which manifestly break spacetime susy . however , the lorentzian spectrum on rindler space is spacetime supersymmetric and hence we expect the free energy to take the form of equation ( [ freesusy ] ) where this factor is indeed present .",
    "* unlike the @xmath72 orbifold models , the modular invariants we obtained here are valid for any real @xmath5 .",
    "modular invariance is _ not _ broken .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that any lorentzian particle state has a meaningful heat kernel on a cone with arbitrary conical deficit .",
    "as discussed previously , using the explicit heat kernel on the cone , it is possible to give a spacetime interpretation to the divergences arising in the constructed partition functions .",
    "we first show how this works for the different types of string theory , and then we explain its relation to the beautiful physical picture by parentani and potting @xcite .",
    "the partition function can be written as @xmath163 the conical heat kernel can be written as @xcite@xcite : @xmath164 here the variable @xmath76 is an additional dummy variable that has no direct physical interpretation .",
    "@xmath122 on the other hand is the radial coordinate in the 2d plane under consideration . + we will first review this spacetime interpretation as was given by emparan in @xcite . the idea is to analyze a possible divergence in the integral over @xmath165 as a function of @xmath122 .",
    "so we swap the integral over @xmath165 with the spatial integral over @xmath122 and the dummy integral over @xmath76 . of course , there is the possibly hazardous power divergence from the prefactor of @xmath166 .",
    "we know this is absent in string theory and we ignore it .",
    "a much more physical divergence arises if there is some exponential divergence if @xmath167 .",
    "since we are considering the modular strip domain , this is to be interpreted as an ir thermal divergence that is indeed relevant .",
    "+ using @xmath168 , in the limit @xmath169 , the integral over @xmath165 converges if @xmath170 for all @xmath76 .",

    "this gives @xmath173 .",
    "+ this perspective is however not without reservation : we naively swapped the @xmath76- and @xmath165-integrals .",
    "is this allowed ? also , the different wrapping numbers are already combined into a closed expression , and hence it is not obvious that the divergence arises from all of them in the same way . + to answer these questions , we will perform the same computation again , but instead using a different formula for the heat kernel .",
    "this will also clearly demonstrate that the divergence indeed arises from all winding numbers ( as we have demonstrated several times already ) .",
    "+ the idea is to use formula ( [ propag ] ) for a fixed winding number @xmath155 and insert this expression into the above expression ( [ divpf ] ) . the small @xmath165 behavior of these fixed winding heat kernels was analyzed in equation ( [ wind0 ] ) for the zero - winding contribution and in equation ( [ windnon0 ] ) for the non - zero winding contribution .",
    "the zero - winding contribution is to be dropped when considering thermodynamic quantities .",
    "the non - zero winding part on the other hand , has for its small @xmath165 asymptotics : @xmath174 which has no exponential ( thermal ) divergence only when @xmath175 , the same result as above .",
    "this computation was done independently of the wrapping number @xmath12 and we hence see from this perspective as well that all windings contribute in the same way to the thermal divergence .      for type ii superstrings ,",
    "the only difference is the oscillator contribution , which this time yields @xmath176 , in the end also giving the same formula @xmath177 but this time with the type ii flat hagedorn temperature used for @xmath178 .      for heterotic strings ,",
    "the situation requires a bit more care . to analyze the divergence in the strip domain",
    ", the approach reviewed in @xcite is ideally suited .",
    "we first expand the modular functions as @xmath179 the partition function to be analyzed can then be expanded as @xmath180 where the relevant part of the heat kernel has already been filled in .",
    "the integral over @xmath114 enforces @xmath181 .",
    "the integral over @xmath80 can be done in terms of a modified bessel function @xmath182 , the details can be found in @xcite .",

    "a very beautiful interpretation of these divergences was made in @xcite in a propagator context .",
    "the idea can be readily adapted to our case for the partition function @xmath1 and goes as follows .",
    "for all types of string theory , the divergence comes from a region close to the black hole horizon , which can be written suggestively as @xmath188 where one plugs in the correct flat space hagedorn temperature for the type of string ( bosonic , type ii or heterotic ) one is considering .",
    "+ usually , the hagedorn temperature is determined when the circumference of the singly wound string around the thermal circle becomes too small . in formulas",
    "@xmath189 where in a thermal theory with topologically supported thermal circle , the circumference is always the inverse temperature @xmath63 . + for the case at hand , there is no physical topologically supported circle .",
    "however , considering the coincident fixed winding heat kernel at a distance @xmath122 , there is a minimal circumference for any trajectory to have : twice the radial distance @xmath122 .",

    "this minimal length is independent of the winding number , as long as it is non - zero.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    afterwards , we integrate over the coordinate @xmath122 to obtain the traced heat kernel , where all locations @xmath122 that are too close to the origin ( black hole horizon ) lead to a divergence , in precisely the same way as when the circumference is below the hagedorn scale in a toroidally compactified model .",
    "+ we note that the associated critical temperature @xmath191 is local , and relies on an extrapolation of qft in curved backgrounds into the stringy regime .",
    "hence one should not attach too much value to it .",
    "the main conclusion is that the non - interacting partition functions for all string types exhibit a divergence , coming from the near - horizon region @xmath192 .",
    "+ as a further characterization of this divergence , we may look at it field by field . the minkowski vacuum which we assume to be used for each field , has a vanishing stress tensor ( by definition ) .",
    "the rindler observer explains this as due to a cancellation of the casimir contribution with the thermal contribution .",
    "when constructing the non - interacting partition functions , we are making modifications on the thermal part of each field .",
    "the casimir part was left alone .",
    "this implies that for each field , there is no longer a perfect cancellation and the stress tensor vev is non - zero in the constructed vacuum .",
    "these build up as one sums over the spectrum and ultimately lead to a divergence in the full string theory",
    ". this vev implies structure is present near the black hole horizon and an infalling observer would no longer be able to pass safely through the horizon . _",
    "the presence of a divergence is hence observer - independent_.",
    "in this paper , we have studied the partition functions of open and closed strings on @xmath20 cones .",
    "+ for open strings , we have demonstrated that the one - loop open string partition function contains exotic interactions with the horizon that are to be interpreted as the sum of the surface contributions of all the higher spin fields in the string spectrum . + whereas for open strings , the situation is more or less completely clear now , this is not so for closed strings .",
    "we demonstrated that there is a difference between the sum - over - fields approach and the full stringy result for the conical partition functions .",
    "this conclusion would not have been possible to make without the explicit expressions found in @xcite for the higher spin conical partition functions .",
    "+ to gain a better understanding of the surface interactions and the interpretation in terms of worldsheets either including or excluding the origin , we considered the partition functions obtained by deleting the surface interactions by hand within the higher spin contributions in the string spectrum .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , if this is a good operation within string theory , several consistency conditions are expected to be fulfilled .",
    "+ the main part of this work has been to establish these consistency requirements , providing faith in the identification of horizon - intersecting worldsheets as the surface interactions",
    ". + the constructions done here are identical to those emparan considered for bosonic strings over 20 years ago @xcite .",
    "inspired by some recent results on entanglement entropy in rindler space @xcite , we have been able to provide more rigor to this construction and extend emparan s idea to type ii and heterotic strings .",
    "the main technical results are partition functions for type ii and heterotic strings , that show explicit spacetime supersymmetry and modular invariance for _ any _ conical deficit .",
    "these partition functions also have a thermal divergence for any conical opening angle that is independent of the winding and momentum around the conical singularity .",
    "+ the upshot for closed strings is that we have a priori three candidate partition functions .",
    "the first is the full stringy result which is of course modular invariant and contains worldsheets intersecting the conical singularity .",
    "the second is the sum - over - fields approach , by including the full contribution from each higher spin field .",
    "this however is not the same as the string result , as an infinite overcounting of tori configurations is done , manifestly leading to an overall divergence .",
    "this candidate partition function hence seems invalid .",
    "the third construction is to sum over all fields and exclude all surface interactions .",
    "the result is modular invariant and is related by worldsheet duality to the same procedure for open strings .",
    "string worldsheets are not allowed to intersect the conical singularity in this case .",
    "a thermal divergence is present for all @xmath63 that can be related to maximal acceleration .",
    "+ in this respect , we have succeeded in deepening our understanding of the link between string theory and the field theories of the states in its spectrum , within these conical backgrounds .",
    "+ one of the lessons to be learned from our endeavors here is that the surface interactions first discovered by kabat for gauge fields , are an important and integral part of perturbative string theory . within string language",
    ", one can associate a clear geometric picture to these .",
    "+ recent work by wall and donnelly @xcite has taught us that for gauge fields , one can view the surface term as representing the edge modes present on the entangling surface , the negativity of these arising as a regularization artifact in the continuum limit .",
    "more precisely , in kabat s original computation @xcite , they arise by utilizing heat kernel regularization .",
    "string theory however has an innate preference for heat kernel regularization ( as the schwinger parameter is directly related to the torus modulus @xmath80 ) .",
    "the negative contributions are intrinsic to the perturbative worldsheet formulation of string theory , and one should be wary of dismissing them simply as a regularization feature in this case",
    ". it will be interesting to investigate this further .",
    "+ let s now come back to the proposal by solodukhin in @xcite as discussed in the introduction , where he envisioned an equality between the tree - level contribution to the bekenstein - hawking entropy and the sum of the contact terms at one loop , up to the sign .",
    "thus the black hole entropy up to one loop would be equal to just the sum of the `` normal '' contributions of the fields in the spectrum .",
    "however , in our string theory context , this is precisely the partition function we developed throughout this work .",
    "this would imply a divergent black hole entropy due to the maximal acceleration , something we deem impossible .",
    "+ an interesting extension would be to look into related orbifolds with fixed points , such as @xmath193 , and obtain the analogous non - interacting partition function .",
    "again modular invariance should be checked explicitly .",
    "+ the best check of our results here would be to simply compute the first quantized torus string path integral with fixed winding number in the strip modular domain and check whether it agrees with expression ( [ bospf ] ) .",
    "this is the analogous computation of that which was done for scalar particles in the past @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the computation seems untractable to perform .",
    "+ our original motivation for this work was to play devil s advocate and provide more detail on this sum - over - fields approach to black hole thermodynamics utilized in the older string literature , to hopefully ultimately show that this route is shaky .",
    "however , we appear to reach the opposite conclusion : good modular invariants can be constructed by simply summing the ( spin - independent parts of the ) lorentzian fields in the string spectrum .",
    "the resulting partition functions show properties that we expect them to have such as spacetime supersymmetry .",
    "+ of course , these non - interacting partition functions are not the ultimate goal when one is interested in thermodynamics in rindler space , as one can not approximate the full thermodynamic quantities by these in any way .",
    "the reason is that sending @xmath194 to zero ( the only way to really achieve the supposedly non - interacting theory ) , actually retains the open - closed interactions on the horizon .",
    "our entire endeavor in this paper has been to understand the difference between these two types of partition functions ( that either include or exclude the surface interactions ) to ultimately gain a better understanding of the surface interactions themselves .",
    "+ the fact that these partition function exhibit a divergence associated to maximal acceleration should not be taken as a failure of string theory , since these do not correspond to any physical observables .",
    "the entropy computed using the full partition function ( i.e. reincluding the surface interactions ) is finite for type ii superstring theory @xcite@xcite .",
    "+ _ hence the maximal acceleration phenomenon is fiction when treating the complete string theory .",
    "_ these partition functions , while mathematically consistent ( modular invariant for a torus interpretation and spacetime susy is apparent ) , can not be reached in a physical scheme when considering string thermodynamics .",
    "+ it is tantalizing to suspect that these non - interacting partition functions and their maximal acceleration divergence are related to the recent firewall paradox . especially since we have demonstrated that a crucial role in eliminating the divergence is played by spin , the role of which in formulating firewall paradoxes has to the best of our knowledge not been studied thoroughly .",
    "closely related , the hilbert space does not cleanly factorize here due to the surface contributions , whereas this factorization is assumed in formulating the firewall paradox .",
    "so we would suggest that the sum of the surface contributions cancels the maximal acceleration `` firewall '' originating from approximating all fields as scalars or spin @xmath145 fermions .",
    "a more detailed comparison is beyond the scope of this work and is left to future work .",
    "+ a basic question does remain at this point : how can one describe these divergences within a field theory action of wound strings ?",

    "how does this work in this case ?",
    "it seems that all winding modes are not aware of the intrinsic conical feature in the space , but instead simply behave the same as the @xmath112 limit of a circular dimension with radius @xmath195 . in some sense",
    ", this is as we would expect since we excised the conical singularity itself from the space by forcing all string worldsheets not to intersect it . a more precise investigation of this point will be very interesting and must unfortunately be left to future work . + it is our hope that the results reported in this paper will help unveil the true nature of quantum black hole horizons within string theory .",

    "one first utilizes the riemann identity to deconstruct this into the bosonic and fermionic contributions : @xmath202 performing a series expansion on the @xmath73-dependent theta - functions , one can write the partition function as @xmath203.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] just as for the bosonic string , the first exponential can be associated to the spacetime spin of each boson or fermion . dropping this contribution ,",
    "one finds for the first two terms precisely the same bosonic sum as before ( these are the bosons ) . ] where @xmath5 is odd . ]",
    "the third sum on the other hand , requires a spin @xmath145 sum ( [ fermsum ] ) .",
    "altogether , one retrieves the result shown in equation ( [ nonintfermpf ] ) .",
    "before starting with the proof , we will check whether the divergence of expression ( [ stripf ] ) as @xmath150 reproduces the winding tachyon divergence of ( [ fundpf ] ) as @xmath149 .",

    "nonetheless , the two partition function are definitely not equal as we now demonstrate .",
    "+ we try to apply the theorem established in @xcite@xcite to the extent that is possible .",
    "we hence start in the modular fundamental domain and try to build up the strip domain by applying suitable modular transformation to the @xmath77 sectors .",
    "+ the first step is to prove that the quantum numbers @xmath12 and @xmath76 transform as a doublet under @xmath206 and allow one to undo the modular transformation at hand .",
    "this was already proven in the early literature on this model , and we will not repeat it . the summary is the transformation rules @xmath207    we first reorder the sums over both quantum numbers such that they include both positive and negative entries , for instance @xmath208 and the same for @xmath12 and @xmath73 .",
    "we henceforth restrict our attention to odd @xmath5 .",
    "this makes the discussion more symmetric , and for type ii superstrings we are restricted to odd @xmath5 in any case .",
    "+ the lowest non - trivial value of @xmath5 is then @xmath209 .",
    "there are three possible values of @xmath76 and three of @xmath12 , yielding 9 states . removing the @xmath210 state",

    "the strategy is to take any fixed state ( @xmath211 ) and construct a suitable modular transformation to get to @xmath171 in a transformed domain that is included within the strip . for each such state ,",
    "the strategy is exactly the same as in flat space .",
    "let us present just the gist of it .",
    "the @xmath212 tranformation that we seek acts on @xmath213 as @xmath214 where @xmath215 and @xmath216 can be fixed by imposing that this transformation sets the new @xmath76 equal to zero .",
    "this entails @xmath217 , which leads to @xmath218 and @xmath219 , for @xmath220 the gcd of @xmath12 and @xmath76 .",
    "the remaining two parameters are then fixed by demanding the transformed modulus to be inside the strip modular domain combined with the determinantal condition @xmath221 .",
    "+ performing such modular transformations on the fundamental domain , one can reach the result of figure [ n3 ] .",
    ".,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the two states that are left alone are @xmath222 and @xmath223 . upon using the @xmath66-transformation",
    ", one finds the two states @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",
    "the region is mapped into the central wedge in the figure .",
    "one can perform analogous modular transformations to reach the other two regions that contain the contributions from the sectors : @xmath226 and @xmath227 for the leftmost wedge and @xmath228 and @xmath229 for the rightmost wedge .",
    "the required modular transformations are respectively , @xmath230 all four wedges contain only the strip quantum number @xmath231 as it should be . hence taking the partition function ( [ fundpf ] ) with @xmath171 , but integrated along the union of these four wedges , one finds back the original result of the fundamental domain ( [ fundpf ] ) . + but this is not the full modular strip of equation ( [ stripf ] ) !",
    "hence , at least for @xmath209 , the sum - over - fields result ( yielding the modular strip ) and the stringy result ( yielding the fundamental domain ) can not be equal in any way . + this result also allows us to explain why the winding tachyon divergence is present in the strip partition function as @xmath150 .",
    "we simply need to ask where the large @xmath80 region for a generic @xmath76 gets mapped into .",
    "one of the sectors that carries the winding tachyon divergence is the ( @xmath232 ) sector . since we started in the fundamental domain and transformed this divergence into the central lower wedge of this figure ; it must hence be present there .",

    "each of the red regions contain 6 states , each of the blue and green regions contain only 2 states .",
    "the total is @xmath253 indeed .",
    "+ one can see that increasing @xmath5 further will generate additional regions , but the contributions to the @xmath73-sum in each region will only fill up slowly , according to the number theoretic properties of the number @xmath5 .",
    "this also precludes a bit whether the @xmath79 limit really gives a nice construction here of the modular strip . for @xmath5",
    "very large but finite , there are still multiple zones that do not even have half of their states included . for @xmath5 strictly infinite however , one should find agreement with the modular strip , but the limit appears to be ill - defined .",
    "+ on a more mathematical level , the above displayed regions are fundamental domains for the hecke congruence subgroups @xmath78 of the modular group .",
    "now let s try to work in the opposite direction .",
    "we start with the sum - over - fields expression ( [ stripf ] ) and try to fold this into the fundamental domain .",
    "following the same theorem , one readily finds that @xmath254 agrees with the result ( [ stripf ] ) .",
    "the only difference with the full string result ( [ fundpf ] ) is the extension to all sets of integers with @xmath255 . from the periodicity of the terms in the partition function as @xmath256 and @xmath257",

    "this expression is ( formally ) modular invariant , since the set of all integers @xmath12 and @xmath76 restricted to @xmath258 for any fixed @xmath259 form an orbit under the full modular group : @xmath212 transformations are unable to change the value of @xmath259 .",

    "one simply finds : @xmath266 for the 2d area @xmath267 .",
    "+ it is interesting to try to reverse the order of these operations .",
    "first , we look at the integrated coincident heat kernel . afterwards , we sum over all @xmath12 .",
    "there are a few things we can learn already just by staring at formula ( [ propag ] ) long enough .",
    "firstly , the positive and negative wrappings sum into a real quantity and the latter is monotonically decreasing as @xmath268 increases . secondly ,",
    "all of these real contributions are strictly positive .",
    "we will see in the end that our resulting formulas respect these properties .",
    "+ to get started , we must regulate the integrals , as one obtains a divergence for each wrapping number and their geometric interpretation is a priori obscured .",
    "so we replace @xmath269 in equation ( [ propag ] ) .",
    "+ the physical interpretation of this regulator @xmath270 can be made apparent , by summing over @xmath155 , taking the coincident limit and then finally again integrating over the plane ( the order of operations done above ) .",
    "this gives @xmath271 so @xmath272 .",
    "+ now let s try to reverse the order of the operations .",
    "+ with this regulator , the integrated coincident heat kernel becomes @xmath273 the integral over @xmath122 can be rewritten as @xmath274 which is the laplace transform of @xmath275 : @xmath276 where we should take @xmath277 .",
    "+ the above integrated heat kernel becomes @xmath278 as a check , upon summing this again over @xmath12 , one obtains the replacement @xmath279 , an integer . with @xmath280 ,",
    "one then recognizes a geometric series : @xmath281 combining this with the expansion @xmath282 this leads again to @xmath283 as it should .",

    "we obtain @xmath287 for @xmath288 , the heat kernel becomes @xmath289 the other heat kernels ( @xmath137 ) are given by @xmath290 summing the latter leads to @xmath291 , again combining into the correct flat space heat kernel . + it is natural that these @xmath292 terms do not diverge as @xmath293 , as the path always has to be of a macroscopic distance to loop around the origin .",
    "they do not scale as the transverse area , which is also expected since the points far from the origin behave completely different than those close to the origin , effectively making the radial direction behave as if it were compact . that it is independent of @xmath165",
    "is unexpected . in equation ( [ propag ] ) would suggest that for all @xmath155 the resulting expression is independent of @xmath165",
    ". we should be careful though , as the integrals can be divergent , in which case an @xmath165-dependent regulator might be physically required . ]",
    "+ as a check on our analytical computations , we checked numerically that the following statements hold for large @xmath122 : @xmath294 confirming that the @xmath295 sector will have a divergent result due to the large @xmath122 integration , unlike the @xmath137 sectors .",
    "thus quite literally , the @xmath137 sectors are confined to the origin and behave as if in a potential well , cutting off the large @xmath122 region .",
    "the first of these formulas actually shows that for large @xmath122 , one has @xmath296 just like in ordinary flat space .",
    "this makes sense since the no - winding restriction is not felt at very large distance from the origin .",
    "the above expression for the heat kernel is perfectly capable of reproducing known formulas for conical spaces .",
    "suppose we consider a conical geometry with periodicity @xmath63 .",
    "a moment s thought reveals that the path integral with fixed wrapping number @xmath12 on the cone can be equivalently seen as the path integral on @xmath297 with wrapping number @xmath298 and an extra angular difference @xmath299 .",
    "+ using the general expression ( [ propag ] ) for this case , we readily obtain @xmath300 directly summing this expression over @xmath12 can not be done so trivially as before . ] which proves to be difficult to manipulate further .",

    "<S> we revisit non - interacting string partition functions in rindler space by summing over fields in the spectrum . in field theory , the total partition function splits in a natural way in a piece that does not contain surface terms and a piece consisting of solely the so - called edge states . for open strings , we illustrate that surface contributions to the higher spin fields correspond to open strings piercing the rindler origin , unifying the higher spin surface contributions in string language . for closed strings , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the string partition function is not quite the same as the sum over the partition functions of the fields in the spectrum : an infinite overcounting is present for the latter . </S>",
    "<S> next we study the partition functions obtained by excluding the surface terms . using recent results of @xcite , this construction , first done by emparan @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> can be put on much firmer ground . </S>",
    "<S> we generalize to type ii and heterotic superstrings and demonstrate modular invariance . </S>",
    "<S> all of these exhibit an ir divergence that can be interpreted as a maximal acceleration close to the black hole horizon . </S>",
    "<S> ultimately , since these partition functions are only part of the full story , divergences here should not be viewed as a failure of string theory : maximal acceleration is a feature of a faulty treatment of the higher spin fields in the string spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we comment on the relevance of this to solodukhin s recent proposal in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a possible link with the firewall paradox is apparent . </S>"
