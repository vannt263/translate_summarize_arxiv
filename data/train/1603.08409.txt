    "in january 2016 , a crocheter on the social networking site ravelry @xcite posted images of a coin purse she had made as a christmas present , and started a discussion thread asking readers of a particular forum if they could help her identify the name of its 3d shape ( hereafter termed _ the shape _ ) .",
    "the purse , shown in figure [ purse ] , had been constructed following a pattern @xcite by making a flat oval , and attaching a zipper to its edge in such a way that when the zipper closed , the purse was not folded over exactly in half onto itself ( flat ) , but sat up , enclosing an intriguingly - shaped volume .",
    "the crocheter had read the german version @xcite of an ian stewart column on the sphericon @xcite , and believed that the shape might be sort - of - but - not - quite a sphericon . however , the paper templates for making one s own sphericons that she had seen @xcite have curved edges only , which her oval did not .    in fact _",
    "oval _ is rather loose a term , and broadly means _",
    "egg - like_. the purse in question had been constructed from a _ stadium _ , the 2d shape made from a rectangle and two semi - circles , as shown in figure [ stad ] .",
    "over the next few weeks , various ravelry members , including the author of this paper , joined in on - line discussion and brain - storming about the shape .",
    "more than 500 of ravelry s ( admittedly 6 million ) members read at least part of the thread ( before , as threads do , it wandered off to shapes more generally ) .",
    "patterns for objects with similar construction were pointed out @xcite . as well as the sphericon family ,",
    "d - forms @xcite were mentioned .",
    "so , was the shape one of these , and if so , which was it ?",
    "this seemingly simple question , prompted by a hand - made christmas gift , has triggered this survey and investigation of sphericons and d - forms .",
    "the main conclulsions of this investigation are to be found in section [ concl ] .",
    "the sphericon has been described as ` [ a ] solid ... not as widely known as it should be ' @xcite , and conversations with mathematical colleagues , and presentations about this work , have shown this to be so .",
    "thus , an introduction to the history , properties and generalisations of sphericons , and of d - forms , make up the next two sections of the paper .",
    "the classification of the shape is then clear .",
    "the paper concludes with some more general results , summarised in table  [ classify ] , and includes templates for the surfaces required to make several particular generalised sphericons by d - forming , thereby stitching ( literally ) a connection between the sphericon family and d - forms .",

    "the sphericon , at least as a mathematical object , came to public attention in stewart s mathematical recreations column @xcite in 1999 .",
    "colin roberts , a joiner who had enjoyed geometry at school , sent stewart his creation , after seeing him on television . the column was written shortly after this .",
    "roberts had first made a sphericon from mahogany some thirty years earlier in 1967 @xcite .",
    "independently , in the early 1980s , an israeli designer david hirsch submitted a patent application for ` meander motion ' toys constructed on the same principles @xcite .",
    "roberts motivation , however , lay in producing a one - surfaced object , with no hole ( unlike the well - known mbius strip ) .",
    "the sphericon can be constructed from a pair of identical cones of apex angle 90 degrees joined at their bases ( a _ bicone _ ) . cut the bicone in half through the two apices so as to reveal its square cross - section , twist one half through 90 degrees , and then ` glue ' the square faces together again , as shown in figure [ cut ] .",
    "especially when made of grained wood , it is a beautiful object .",
    "it has a single , sinuous surface @xcite , and two disjoint curved edges , set at right angles ; see figure  [ sphericon ] .",
    "the surface has the property that if one traces a finger along the middle of it , one comes back to the starting point @xcite .",
    "( rather inaccurately from the point of view of mathematical terminology , this has been called a ` continuous ' surface @xcite ; we will avoid that term . ) the two curved edges each end in vertices ( four in total ) .    the sphericon rolls in an amusing manner , what stewart terms ` a controlled wiggle ' @xcite , the meander motion of hirsch s toys @xcite .",
    "a _ sphere _ will roll in a straight line , and a _ cone _ rolls in a circle . the sphericon changes direction as the parts of its surface come into contact with the surface it is rolling on , but on average the motion is in a line .",
    "hence the name _",
    "sphericon_. sphericons are one of the intriguing solids that can be assembled , and their rolling behaviour predicted , at momath in new york @xcite .",
    "the sphericon featured next in the monthly feature column of the american mathematical society @xcite .",
    "the sphericon was used as an interesting examplar of how edges and apices have to be treated carefully , in order to calculate the total gaussian curvature of the figure to be the expected @xmath5 .",
    "phillips introduced the _",
    "hexasphericon _ and found connections between such higher order sphericons ( to be introduced below ) and his work on mazes @xcite .",
    "some particular closed space curves were found to lie on the sphericon surface @xcite , and an explicit hybrid function form ( in cartesian coordinates ) is given .",
    "perhaps not surprisingly , given its origins , wood - turners began experimenting with the sphericon .",
    "a special join , called a paper join , enables the cutting - open process to be done without damage .",
    "the bicone can be replaced by any solid of revolution with appropriate cross - section symmetry .",
    "some makers introduced different profiles ( producing what they termed _ femispheres _ ) or non - convex cross - sections ( the _ streptohedrons _ ) @xcite .",
    "other makers @xcite generated some of the convex geometric objects that are classified as the series of @xmath6-icons @xcite .",
    "sphericons have been made of ceramic , glass , plastic ( 3d printing ) and as metal sculptures , as well as of wood .",
    "think of the bicone as the solid of revolution of a square about its diagonal ( as in the image ( a ) of figure [ cut ] ) .",
    "now replace the square by any other @xmath6-vertex regular convex polygon , and use one of the symmetry axes to generate a solid of revolution @xcite .",
    "when @xmath6 is odd , this axis will run through one vertex and one straight edge of the polygon .",
    "when @xmath6 is even , the polygonal cross - section can be rotated about an axis through two opposite vertices or through the midpoints of two opposing edges . for @xmath7 ,",
    "different ` @xmath6-icons ' can be produced by more than one rotation ( in the cut - rotate - reglue process ) , due to the rotational symmetries of the cross - section ; these may be completely different or may come in right- and left - hand pairs .",
    "a full classification of the family of solids requires one to specify @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the rotation ( in radians ) between cutting and regluing , termed the twist @xcite .",
    "two special cases will now be considered :    * the dual sphericon * rotating a square about an axis through the midpoints of opposite edges results in a cylinder of equal height and diameter . applying the cutting and rotating process ,",
    "an object with _ two surfaces _ and _ one closed edge _ is produced , as illustrated in figure [ dual ] .",
    "this object is dual to the original sphericon in a particular sense ; the sphericon has _ two disjoint edges _ ending in vertices and _ one surface _ that can be traced as described above .",
    "springett @xcite described this object , which wood - turners term _ side - cut _ , as being ` rather unexciting ' . in the cutting process",
    ", four semicircles are produced , which are then joined smoothly to the sides of the cylinder .",
    "the paper template for this object consists of not one stadium , but two .",
    "the dual sphericon is a possible two - sided die . indeed , such dice  and various @xmath10-icons",
    " are available from various 3d printing artists .",

    "( indeed , the crocheter mentioned in the introduction had done exactly this with her family , which is why she was familiar with them . ) of course , you will not have a solid sphericon ; you will have the surface and will manipulate and tape it to enclose a volume shaped like the solids .",
    "the d - form entered mathematics in a similar way to the sphericon  but this time from design .",
    "they are 3d objects formed when the boundaries of two 2d shapes of equal perimeter length are joined .",
    "the british designer and inventor tony wills says they came to him in a dream , as a way of expanding his working vocabulary of forms @xcite .",
    "wills has used d - forms in street architecture ( benches , bins , bollards ) @xcite .",
    "the constituent 2d shapes need to be made of a material that does not stretch or shear ; a typical cushion is not a d - form !",
    "two circles can not produce a ( non - trivial ) d - form , but two identical offset ellipses do , as seen in figure  [ ms ] .",
    "the cross - section of the object produced using two ellipses with their major axes set at right angles looks like the letter capital .",
    "( d is for dream , for the shape of this cross - section and also for developable surfaces @xcite . )",
    "as the shapes are joined , they inform each other as to how their joined boundary should curve in space .",
    "wills observed that choosing different points on the boundaries of the 2d shapes to start the seam between them changes the resulting d - form @xcite .",
    "he investigated joining the boundary of a circle to that of a square ( i.e. not a smooth boundary ) producing an object he termed a squaricle , and also used non - convex shapes .",
    "baseball construction @xcite is an example of d - forming that long pre - dates wills ; two flat pieces of leather have been designed ( by trial and error initially ) to be joined in such a way that their seam lies on a sphere .",
    "the initial 3d form is not spherical  the leather is subsequently stretched over a hard spherical core .",
    "d - forms are piece - wise _ developable surfaces _ , in that they can be cut open and each piece flattened , without creasing , to be planar @xcite , although they have been described thus far as being formed by the reverse process .",
    "developable surfaces have the advantage for designers , artists and builders that they can be constructed from rolled sheet metal ; even ships and airplanes are made this way @xcite .",
    "d - forms have been observed to have much in common with various sculptural works @xcite .",
    "predicting in advance what the d - form will look like , and hence what 2d shapes to use , is not easy , though computational methods ( based on meshes ) have been developed @xcite .",
    "a recent paper @xcite describes software used ( in the education of architecture students ) to match the perimeter length of different planar shapes , scaling them to be isoperimetric , in order that they can be used to create d - forms .    as with the sphericon , making a paper model , right now , will help you understand how d - forms evolve in front of you and how beautiful they can be .",
    "you can use a template @xcite  or you can easily cut your own using a double layer of paper .",
    "d - forms were introduced to the mathematical world by wills and sharp before their publications @xcite .",
    "questions @xcite regarding their creasing , and whether or not a d - form is always the convex hull of a space curve , were posed in 2001 and addressed in 2007 , with the boundaries of the 2d shapes restricted to being convex @xcite .",
    "demaine and orourke also introduced the concept of a _ pita - form _",
    "a pita - form is defined to be the 3d shape obtained by glueing ( or zipping ) the boundary of a _ single _ convex 2d shape to itself .",
    "demaine returned to the open questions surrounding d - forms with a different co - author in 2010 @xcite .",
    "they established that both d - forms and pita - forms are the convex hull of their seams , that d - forms are always crease - free away from the seam , but that a pita - form may have at most one crease , between the two endpoints of its seam .",
    "( of course , ` crease ' has to be defined a bit more carefully ( in terms of differentiability properties ) than by simply looking at a paper model , as this initially led to the proposition that pita - forms also might never have creases @xcite . )",
    "also introduced were _",
    "seam forms _ , a natural generalization to more flat ( convex ) pieces than two .",
    "( it may be pertinent to mention one more concept introduced by demaine and collaborators , that of _ zipper unfolding _ of a polyhedron @xcite , to prevent confusion . in this case , the surface being zipped is deliberately folded , marking it into the polygons that constitute the faces of the polyhedron . )",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , both sphericons and d - forms were suggested as describing the shape ( figure  [ purse ] ) , formed from a crocheted stadium , lined so that there is some rigidity to the surface and no shearing or stretching , before the zipper is added .",
    "the astute reader will by now have realised that , simply , it is a pita - form , made from a stadium .    this author has experimented with making various pita - forms from crocheted stadia , varying the ratio between the rectangle s height and the radius of the semi - circles , and with different starting points for the seam ( figure  [ pita ] ) .",
    "tips for making your own from fibre are given in appendix a.    but does the shape belong on the sphericon family tree also ?    as should have become clear from section  [ solid ] , any @xmath6-icon s surface is subject to symmetry , side length and angle constraints prescribed by its construction from a regular 3d object .",
    "what if one steps back from these origins , and hence from these constraints ?",
    "could not the stadium ( figure  [ stad ] ) be regarded as the outcome of relaxing conditions which led to figure [ temp ] ? just as the two shapes in figure [ hex ] are hexagons , one regular and one irregular , the shape , with its one surface and one -shaped seam between two distinct endpoints , could be termed an ` irregular trisphericon ' , to coin a phrase .",
    "iin 0, ... ,5 ( i ) at ( i60:1.5 ) ; iin 0, ... ,5 let 1=int(mod(i+1,6 ) ) in ( i )  ( 1 ) ;    ( 0,0 )  + +",

    "moving on further from the original question about the shape that motivated this investigation , what of other relationships between the sphericon family , and pita- and d - forms ?",
    "a kinship is foreshadowed in the works of the turkish artist ilhan koman .",
    "consider the piece called _ rolling lady _ which dates from 1983 @xcite .",
    "it consists of two bicones ( four developable surfaces ) interlocked at right angles in such a way as to roll . at its elegant heart",
    "lie two perpendicular circles , just as two perpendicular edges , circle sectors , are a striking feature of the sphericon .",
    "( in this article , the connection of the sphericon to the rollers and wobblers of @xcite , and to the oloid , has not been explored , being somewhat tangential to the identification question under consideration . )",
    "let s look at the shape that did not much interest springett , the dual sphericon ( figure [ dual ] ) .",
    "again , the astute reader has probably pre - empted the statement that this is precisely a d - form obtained from two stadia , with @xmath33 , and attached to one another symmetrically .",
    "this inspired the crocheted piece _ d - based _ shown in figure [ ball ] .",
    "d - forms made using stadia seem not to have been mentioned or visualised prior to 2007 @xcite .",
    "authors moved directly from dismissing the circle to trying out the ellipse .",
    "perhaps this springs from the fact that the cone is probably the most well - known developable surface @xcite , so that conic sections seemed a natural constituent for d - forms ( despite the fact that there is no formula for the perimeter of an ellipse , and matching perimeter length is the name of the game in making d - forms @xcite ) .",
    "of course , a stadium has a perimeter that can be calculated as precisely as one might wish : @xmath34 .",
    "two identical stadia can always be joined to form a d - form , but this will only be a dual sphericon if the midpoints of the semicircles on one stadium are joined to the midpoints of the straight sides of the other , and if @xmath35 . when @xmath36 , and the attachment is midpoint - to - midpoint , the elongated object is stable on one of its four semi - circular faces .",
    "such a d - form makes an excellent four - sided die .",
    "in fact , it is arguably nicer than the one based on the tetrahedron , which has a point , not a face , in the air ! when @xmath37 , and the attachment is symmetric , the object is stable only when it rests on the centre - line of one or other of its two curved surfaces .",
    "if tilted slightly from this position , it will rock back .",
    "hollow mock - ups of these two d - forms can be seen in figure [ stable ] .",
    "a perfectly constructed dual sphericon has stability properties that transition between these two cases . tilting the dual sphericon",
    "when it is sitting on the centre - line of one of its two curved surfaces does not raise or lower the centre of gravity , so that this is a position of neutral equilibrium ; it rolls , until it sits flat on one of its two semicircular faces .",
    "it is interesting to classify which @xmath0-icons , over and above the trisphericon and the dual sphericon , are d - forms and pita - forms ( in the sense of permitting the convexity condition on the constituent surfaces to be relaxed ) .",
    "the information needed to perform this classification is available , though using unconventional mathematical nomenclature , and at least one error , in early studies at un - maintained web sites @xcite .",
    "it is collected and corrected in table [ classify ] . in interpreting this table ,",
    "the values of @xmath38 are restricted to @xmath39 for @xmath6 odd , and to @xmath40 for @xmath6 even , limiting the forms to those which are unique ( up to chirality ) .",
    "[ classify ]    an @xmath0-icon will be a pita - form if it has one surface and one edge that runs between two distinct endpoints ; it will be a @xmath41-form if it has two surfaces and one closed edge .    from this we can conclude :    * when @xmath6 is odd , and co - prime to @xmath38 , the @xmath0-icon is a generalised pita - form .",
    "( this includes the trisphericon . the first values for which this does not apply are @xmath42 . ) * when @xmath6 is even , and the @xmath0-icon has been generated using the midpoint - to - midpoint symmetry axis , it will be a d - form , if @xmath43 and @xmath38 are co - prime .",
    "( this includes the dual sphericon .",
    "it also , for example , includes all 5 possible @xmath44 forms . )    by way of illustration , figure  [ hexasphericon ] shows a wooden version of the dual hexasphericon ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) ; the two semicircular ends that are visible are from the same surface .",
    "when a regular hexagon ( side length @xmath3 ) is rotated to form a solid of revolution ( about the midpoints of a pair of opposite straight edges ) , its vertices trace out three circles .",
    "two of these have radius @xmath3 , and the other has radius @xmath2 , the distance between opposite vertices in a regular hexagon , by elementary geometry ( see figure  [ hex ] ) .",

    "to crochet a stadium is not as daunting a task as making the lorentz manifold @xcite or even a hyperbolic plane @xcite . to make a dual sphericon , you will need to crochet two identical pieces . to make a pita - form , you need only one .",
    "you will need yarn , a crochet hook , a sewing needle and scissors ( only to cut threads , not to cut the surface ! ) .",
    "any ( free or purchased ) non - lacy pattern for an ` oval ' will suffice .",
    "this could be a pattern for a rug or table mat . `",
    "oval ' is used in craft forums ( and daily conversation ) for just about anything which is not symmetric enough to be a circle and not angular enough to be a rectangle , and even for 3d forms , so check to see that it is actually going to produce a stadium ( figure [ stad ] ) .",
    "if you are familiar with both knitting and crochet , you will realise that to produce a stadium , crochet is easiest .",
    "this is related to the reason that crochet is more natural for producing hyperbolic surfaces @xcite ; because one works with a stitch at a time on the hook , and can control stitch height , different types of shapes can be made in crochet from those made with knitting .",
    "i have chosen to make my models so far using plarn ( plastic yarn , made by recycling shopping bags ) which produces quite a stiff fabric even for treble ( uk ) stitches .",
    "using acrylic yarn and a smaller - than - usual hook to produce a dense fabric in double ( uk ) crochet would also work @xcite . if you decide to stuff your models , use just enough stuffing that they do not collapse , but not so much as to distort them .",
    "my models are quite small , but larger models will probably need stuffing .",
    "another method to get around the inherent stretchiness and floppiness of most knitted or crocheted fabric , and the shaping disadvantages of knitting , is to use felted knitted fabric , cut to shape , as seen in figure  [ ms ] .",
    "i closed my models by overstitching , pulling only tight enough to close the seam , again to avoid distortion .    for",
    "the dual sphericon , begin by joining the midpoint of a semicircle on one stadium to the midpoint of the straight side of the other , and then join stitch by stitch , until the two pieces are joined . for the pita - form",
    ", you can pick any starting point ( apart from the exact midpoints ) for your seam .",
    "it s fun to make several , using different starting points .    to control the size of the rectangular part of your stadium , vary the length of the starting chain .",
    "the diameter of the semi - circular parts depends on the stitch height ( double or treble ) and the number of rounds completed ; you will need to make a gauge swatch if you want stadia of precise measurements .",
    "it might be fun to use @xmath56        interesting pita - forms are obtained for @xmath58 such as those created using the pattern _ zippy strip _ @xcite . in this case , the stadium continues to wrap around itself , with the seam forming a helix in space ( rather than just an ) .",
    "again , the starting point of the seam will determine the final outcome .",
    "some makers describe a flattish purse ( figure [ zippy ] ) , while others obtain something more ` pyramidal ' . in making one myself",
    ", i observed that remarkable feature of d - forms , that they continue to develop right up until they are closed .",
    "this development is captured in figure [ contort ] ."
