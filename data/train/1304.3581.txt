    "the reliable prediction of the equilibrium structure and energetics of hybrid inorganic / organic systems from first principles represents a great challenge for theoretical methods due to the interplay of covalent interactions , electron transfer processes , pauli repulsion , and van der waals ( vdw ) interactions . during recent years",
    ", huge efforts have been made to incorporate vdw interactions into density functional theory ( dft ) calculations in order to determine the structure and stability of @xmath0-conjugated organic molecules on solid surfaces  @xcite .",
    "understanding these interface properties is relevant , _ inter alia _ , for electron transfer processes in organic devices . until now and despite the obvious benefit , there are only few a studies of metal - organic interfaces combining theory and experiment . here ,",
    "x - ray standing wave ( xsw ) measurements can provide an important test for dft calculations  @xcite .",
    "this is particularly important for systems with strong vdw contributions to the overall bonding , for which no simple substrate dependence is expected . as model system we chose diindenoperylene ( dip , @xmath3 ) , a @xmath0-conjugated organic semiconductor with excellent optoelectronic device performance , which has been studied over the last decade both in thin - films  @xcite and in monolayers on noble metal surfaces  @xcite .",
    "with respect to its chemical structure , dip is a relatively simple , planar hydrocarbon without heteroatoms .",
    "in contrast to the intensely studied perylene derivative 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride ( ptcda , @xmath4 )  @xcite with its four keto groups , the dip  substrate interaction is not complicated by polar side groups , and the influence of intermolecular interactions is expected to be smaller than for ptcda  @xcite . here , we present a systematic study with high - precision experimental data and state - of - the - art calculations of dip adsorbed on cu(111 ) , ag(111 ) , and au(111 ) .",
    "this allows us to assess the role and relative contribution of the vdw interactions , which , contrary to simplistic pictures , we find here to be lowest for the most polarizable substrate .",
    "dft calculations were performed using a method that extends standard pairwise vdw approaches  @xcite to model adsorbates on surfaces  @xcite .",
    "this was achieved by combining the dft+vdw scheme  @xcite with the lifshitz - zaremba - kohn ( lzk ) theory for vdw interaction between an atom and the surface  @xcite of a solid . in our approach ( dft+vdw@xmath1 ) , the vdw energy is given by a sum of @xmath5 terms , where @xmath6 are the distances between atoms @xmath7 and @xmath8 , in analogy to standard pairwise dispersion corrected dft methods . however , by employing the lzk theory we include the many - body collective response ( _ screening _ ) of the substrate electrons in the determination of the @xmath9 coefficients and vdw radii , going effectively beyond the pairwise description .",
    "interface polarization effects are accounted for via the inclusion of semi - local hybridization due to the dependence of the @xmath10 interatomic coefficients on the electron density in the dft+vdw method .",
    "the dft+vdw@xmath1 method has been shown to yield remarkably accurate results for the structure and adsorption energies of xenon , benzene , and ptcda on a variety of ( 111 ) metal surfaces  @xcite .",
    "the fhi - aims code  @xcite was employed for our dft calculations .",

    "the electron density and 10@xmath12 ev for the total energy of the system were used .",
    "a convergence criterion of 0.01 ev /  for the maximum final force was used for all structure relaxations . the scaled zeroth - order regular approximation ( zora )",
    "was applied for inclusion of scalar relativistic effects  @xcite . the dft+vdw@xmath13 method employed the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) functional  @xcite .",
    "the sampling of the brillouin zone was done using a @xmath14 @xmath15-point grid .",
    "we used a @xmath16 unit cell composed of a metal surface of three layers and one single dip molecule . in the absence of experimental data for the in - plane registry we placed the central ring of the molecule aligned with a topmost metal layer atom and the major axis of the molecule aligned along the cell diagonal .",
    "this structure was adopted for the cu(111 ) , ag(111 ) , and au(111 ) surfaces . in each simulation",
    "we obtained the adsorption energy curve using a rigid dip molecule and tuning the surface ",
    "molecule distance @xmath17 .",
    "the adsorption energy per molecule @xmath18 was calculated from @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the energy per unit cell of the isolated metal surface , @xmath21 is the energy per unit cell of the isolated dip molecule , and @xmath22 is the energy per unit cell of the combined system .",
    "we also obtained the relaxed geometries for all three systems starting from the static equilibrium geometry . during geometry relaxation",
    ", we allowed only the topmost metal layer and the molecule to relax while the other two metal layers were fixed . from the final relaxed configurations we obtained the bonding distance @xmath17 by taking the average position of all dip carbon atoms with respect to the unrelaxed topmost surface layer .",
    "this definition is consistent with the analysis of the xsw data .",
    "to measure the bonding distance of dip we used the xsw technique  @xcite , which yields precise and element - specific structural data .",
    "the experiments were performed at beamline id32 of the esrf @xcite .",
    "dip films were prepared and studied _ in situ _ under ultrahigh - vacuum conditions . a separate preparation chamber contained a knudsen cell , a quartz crystal microbalance , installations for ar@xmath23 sputtering , and a temperature - controlled sample stage .",
    "the main chamber , in which the xsw measurements were performed , was equipped with a sample manipulator and a hemispherical specs phoibos 225 hv photoelectron analyzer .",

    "surface cleanliness was confirmed with x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) as well as low - energy electron diffraction ( leed ) .",
    "sublimation grade dip was evaporated from a home - built knudsen cell .",
    "the intensity ratio of the c 1__s _ _ signal relative to a substrate core - level , normalized with the corresponding photoemission cross sections , was used to determine the number of dip molecules on the surface . with the unit cell size of dip on cu(111 )  @xcite , ag(111 )  @xcite , and au(111 )  @xcite , the coverages were calculated to be between @xmath27 and @xmath28 ml .     with the xsw setup at id32 . from each signal",

    "in addition to each main peak , a second weak feature at @xmath241ev higher binding energy possibly related to a shake - up process can be observed .",

    "[ fig : adsorption ] .",
    "we hence find that the pbe+vdw@xmath44 method applied to dip on cu(111 ) , ag(111 ) , and au(111 ) yields an agreement better than 0.1 between theoretical calculations and experiments . in accordance with the bonding distances ,",
    "the calculated adsorption energies listed in table  [ tab : dft_results ] follow the trend @xmath45 for small distances ] compared to ag(111 ) and au(111 ) , which is due to significant interaction between dip and cu(111 ) .",
    "one may speculate that the interaction mechanism includes hybridization between dip and cu states .",
    "in addition to the adsorption energies and average bonding distances , table  [ tab : dft_results ] holds the minimal and maximal bonding distances @xmath46 of individual carbon atoms in dip . these values indicate that the molecule adsorbs in a slightly tilted or distorted geometry . for cu(111 ) , where the effect is most pronounced , the calculated bonding distances @xmath47 and @xmath48 differ by @xmath240.4 , which is equivalent to a molecular tilt angle of 1.5@xmath25 .",
    "the corresponding spread of vertical positions of the carbon atoms leads to a reduced @xmath29 in the xsw scans .",
    "model simulations similar to those presented in ref .",
    "show that the dft - derived adsorption geometry on cu(111 ) results in a relatively small decrease of the coherent fraction ( @xmath49 ) , which lies within the standard deviation of our xsw measurements . to obtain a better understanding of the influence of lateral intermolecular interactions on the dip adsorption geometry",
    ", we also computed the relaxed dip geometry for different cu(111 ) , ag(111 ) , and au(111 ) unit cells . for dip on cu(111 ) , we increased the unit cell from @xmath16 to @xmath50 in order to reduce the molecule  molecule interactions .",
    "we studied various configurations , finding a flat relaxed geometry for each case considered .",
    "the bonding distance is slightly larger ( 2.64  ) than for the calculation with the smaller unit cell . for dip on ag(111 ) , we also considered a unit cell which was determined from a closed packed monolayer on ag(111 )  @xcite .",
    "the relaxed geometry of the molecules in the monolayer is flat and the bonding distance @xmath51   in almost perfect agreement with the experimental one , i.e. ,  even better than the result for ag(111 ) shown in table  [ tab : dft_results ] . for a @xmath52 unit cell of au(111 ) , the relaxed dip geometry yields an equilibrium distance of 3.15  , also in slightly better agreement with experiment than the result shown in table  [ tab : dft_results ] .",
    "overall , these calculations agree with the experimental observation that the vertical dip position depends only weakly on surface coverage .",
    "for the unrelaxed dip molecule as a function of its averaged distance @xmath17 from the cu(111 ) , ag(111 ) , and au(111 ) surfaces .",
    "the curves are shown for the pbe functional with and without the inclusion of long - range vdw interactions using the vdw@xmath1 method .",
    "the reported contribution of the vdw energy is shown at the equilibrium distance corresponding to the fully relaxed dip  surface geometry ( see text ) . ]    with the experimental and theoretical values at hand , and in view of their excellent agreement , we are in a good position to discuss the vdw interactions and the bonding distances in more detail . as described above , the ( atom - atom ) vdw energy is computed as @xmath53 , where the @xmath10 coefficient determines the strength of the interaction between atoms @xmath7 and @xmath8 , while @xmath6 is the distance between adsorbate and substrate atoms ( fig .  [",
    "fig : e_vdw ] ) .",
    "integration of the vdw energy for a single atom adsorbed on a semi - infinite surface yields the atom ",
    "surface vdw energy as  @xcite @xmath54 , where now @xmath55 determines the interaction strength between atom and surface , @xmath56 corresponds to the distance of the atom to the uppermost surface layer , and @xmath57 indicates the position of the surface image plane . in a rather naive picture ,",
    "the @xmath55 coefficient can be determined simply from the @xmath58 and the @xmath59 coefficients that correspond to the adsorbed atom and the metal atom , respectively . however , the situation for real surfaces is more complex because both localized and bulk metal electrons contribute to the @xmath55 coefficient in a non - trivial way , meaning that this coefficient depends on the dielectric function of the underlying solid .",
    "we computed the @xmath55 coefficients corresponding to the interaction between a carbon atom and the cu(111 ) , ag(111 ) , and au(111 ) surfaces . when describing the metal surface as a simple collection of non - interacting atoms we obtain @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 hartree@xmath63bohr@xmath64 .",
    "in contrast , when using the more appropriate lifshitz - zaremba - kohn expression  @xcite for @xmath55 , we obtain @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 hartree@xmath63bohr@xmath64 .",
    "this clearly illustrates that the vdw interaction between an atom and a solid surface is significantly modified by the collective electronic response within the substrate surface  @xcite .     between adsorbate and substrate atoms .",
    "( b ) vdw energy of dip adsorbed on cu(111 ) , ag(111 ) , and au(111 ) as a function of the distance between adsorbate and substrate atoms . ]    the very similar lzk @xmath68 coefficients for cu , ag , and au lead to essentially the same adsorption energy at large distances for dip on cu(111 ) , ag(111 ) , and au(111 ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : adsorption ] ) .",
    "however , at shorter molecule ",
    "surface distances , which include the equilibrium distance , the adsorption energy is determined by an interplay between the vdw attraction and the pauli repulsion with a possible covalent component .",
    "the pauli repulsion follows roughly the trend of decreasing vdw radii , with a faster onset in terms of the molecule ",
    "surface distance for au ( with the largest vdw radius ) , and then decreasing for ag and cu .",
    "therefore , for au the balance between the vdw attraction and the pauli repulsion is obtained _ further away _ from the substrate ( i.e. ,  at larger adsorption distances ) than for cu , which in turn makes the adsorption energies _ lower _ for au than for cu , in contrast to the possible naive expectation of au with its higher polarizability and @xmath9 coefficient exhibiting a stronger vdw interaction than cu .",
    "the difference in the vdw energy distribution for dip on cu(111 ) , ag(111 ) , and au(111 ) is visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig : e_vdw](b ) , where the vdw energy between dip and substrate atoms is plotted as a function of their distance @xmath6 .",
    "in contrast to ag(111 ) and au(111 ) , the small bonding distance of dip on cu(111 ) results in a second peak in the histogram at @xmath243.6  , which originates from the higher atomic density of the cu substrate .",
    "in conclusion , the bonding distances calculated with the pbe+vdw@xmath1 method are in excellent agreement with the xsw data for dip on cu(111 ) , ag(111 ) , and au(111 ) ( 2.51 , 3.01 , and 3.10  , respectively ) .",
    "our combined study demonstrates that the vdw energy is larger for dip on cu(111 ) than for dip on ag(111 ) and au(111 ) .",
