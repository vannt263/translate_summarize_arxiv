    "electron energy - loss spectroscopy ( eels ) is an efficient and widely used experimental method to study excitation processes on clean and adsorbates - covered surfaces of solids , and in thin ( including atomically thin ) films @xcite .",
    "this method utilizes the inelastic scattering of electrons , resulting in both the energy and momentum transfer from the projectiles to diverse kinds of excitations in the samples . reflected or transmitted electrons",
    "are analyzed with respect to the energy and momentum loss they have experienced in the interaction with a target , revealing a wealth of information about the properties of the latter .",
    "much efforts have been exerted over years to complement eels experimental techniques with comprehensive theoretical pictures @xcite . in this way , a clear understanding of elementary excitations ( such as electron - hole pairs generation , collective electronic excitations ",
    "plasmons , atomic vibrational modes , _ etc . _ ) , including their momentum dispersion , for solid surfaces , interfaces , and in thin films have been achieved .",
    "presently , the main approach to interpret eels data theoretically is to use _ energy - loss functions_. a clear example is the surface energy - loss function of a semi - infinite solid , which , with the neglect of the momentum dispersion , can be written as @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the frequency - dependent dielectric function ( df ) of the bulk solid .",
    "this example exhibits an important feature common also to other , much more sophisticated , loss - functions : @xmath2 of eq .",
    "( [ ls ] ) is a property of the target only . indeed ,",
    "it is not concerned with the setup of the eels experiment , such as the angles of incidence and reflection ( or transmission ) , the energy of the electrons in the incident beam , and , which is subtler , the detailed , desirably quantum - mechanical , motion of the probe electrons both outside and inside the target . as a clear reason why such an approach may not be adequate",
    ", we note that it can not , in principle , determine the relative intensities of the surface and the bulk plasmons in a given eels setup , the bulk response being given in the same approximation by another energy - loss function @xmath3 . for systems where the bulk and the surface excitations overlap ,",
    "as is the case , e.g. , of silver , this constitutes a serious limitation .",
    "meanwhile , a theoretical approach to eels taking full account of the incident electron kinematics had been introduced two decades ago @xcite .",
    "this is based on the solution to the problem of the energy - loss by an electron traveling in the lattice potential of a target , utilizing the method known in the scattering theory as the _ distorted - wave approximation _",
    "@xcite ( see eq .",
    "( [ dsdwdw ] ) of the next section ) .",
    "that formal theory of the response of the target system coupled to the quantum - mechanical motion of the projectile electron has , however , never been implemented to the full extent in calculations for specific systems .",
    "indeed , the formalism importantly stipulates that the density - functional theory@xcite ( dft ) potential used in the calculations of the ground - state and of the response of the target , on one hand , and the potential which determines the motion of the projectile electron , on the other , should be the same crystalline potential .",
    "only two specific applications of the theory have been made so far . in the first , the theory of ref .   has been implemented for jellium within a model of the incident electron reflected from an infinite barrier at a given position above / below the surface @xcite . in the other , which is an application to the inelastic low - energy electron diffraction ( leed ) of simple metals ,",
    "a severe approximation of the kinematic diffraction theory was used @xcite . at the same time , detailed measurements in the high - resolution eels ( hreels ) of silver surface in the wide energy range have become available recently@xcite , calling for the implementation of refined theoretical methods .",
    "[ h ]    the purpose of this paper is , therefore , two - fold .",
    "first , we aim at the implementation of the theory of eels of ref .   in its original form ,",
    "i.e. , that would treat the incident electron and the electrons of the target system on the same footing .",
    "secondly , we apply this theory to the eels of ag surface , which is exactly the case when the interplay of the response of the target with the details of the probe s motion is especially important , due to the overlap of the bulk and the surface features in the excitation spectrum of this material , as is illustrated in fig .",
    "thereby we both further advance the theory of eels and achieve an improvement in the understanding of the experimental spectra of the ag surface .",
    "since the fully _ ab initio _ solution to the problem of the dielectric response of @xmath4-metals still remains a computationally formidable task , we have to resort to some model considerations .",
    "first , we substitute the three - dimensional ( 3d ) problem with a one - dimensional ( 1d ) one , neglecting the system s non - uniformity in the surface plane .",
    "second , the @xmath4-electrons are included in a phenomenological way , using the model of liebsch @xcite of the background df .",
    "this work should , therefore , be considered as a step forward toward the full - featured 3d implementation of the same method , treating also @xmath4-electrons _",
    "ab initio_. however , the main ingredients of the theory ( among them , importantly , the necessary inclusion of the optical potential ) are presented and discussed in this work , facilitating the future implementation of the method in full .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ form ] we remind and further work out details of including the motion of the scattered electrons in the theory of eels . in sec .",
    "[ res ] , results of the calculations conducted with the use of our theory are presented and discussed .",

    ".    it must be , however , emphasized that the above picture is no more than a convenient verbal description of the strict mathematical formalism presented in ref .  : the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ dsdwdw ] ) does not rely on the substitution of the true quantum - mechanical scattering problem for an electron with an artificial charge - density .",
    "it rather solves the problem of the combined elastic and inelastic scattering of a charge at an arbitrary many- ( or a few ) body system , which , with a mild assumption that the impinging electron can be considered distinguishable from those of the target , can be put into the terms of the density - response function of the target and the elastic scattering states of the projectile .",

    "( [ dsdwdw ] ) is exact to the first order in the inelastic processes ( the first born approximation ) and it is exact to _ all _ orders in the elastic scattering .",
    "it includes both the long- and the short - range interaction of the probe electron with the target , i.e. , the dipole and impact scattering@xcite , respectively , within , most importantly , the quantum - mechanical treatment of the probe itself .",
    "of course , practically , the quality of specific calculations by eq .",
    "( [ dsdwdw ] ) depends on the accuracy of the approximations used to calculate its ingredients , i.e. , the density - response function of the target @xmath13 and the wave - functions of the incoming and outgoing electron utilized in the construction of @xmath23 .",
    "we now turn to the use of specific models .      in this work we will use a simplification of the potential @xmath21=@xmath24 averaged in the plane parallel to the surface ( which is chosen as the @xmath25-plane , with the @xmath26-axis normal to the surface and directed into vacuum ) . in this case",

    "then @xmath28 can be conveniently found as a solution to the schrdinger equation with the following asymptotic boundary conditions @xmath29    @xmath30    the asymptotic of @xmath31 is easily obtained from the relation @xmath32 therefore , using eqs .",

    "note that in vacuum it contains both outgoing and incoming beam .",
    "thus , while in leed and pe setups each of these kinds of the wave - functions enters separately , in eels they are present together .    for @xmath35 we can write @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38",

    "importantly , similar to the low - energy electron diffraction ( leed ) theory  @xcite , the inclusion of the optical potential ( op ) into the hamiltonian is necessary for eels theory as well .",
    "this can be understood considering that , without op , electrons having gone an arbitrarily long round - trip into the depth of the sample , would contribute to the spectrum .",
    "since , in the first born approximation , the probability of the bulk energy - loss is proportional to the path - length travelled , this would make the intensity of the bulk losses infinitely high .",

    "[ sp2 ] the results for the specular geometry with @xmath85 and the same primary energy are presented .",
    "the comparison of the theory with the experiment is reasonably good .",
    "most importantly , the sharp bulk and surface plasmon peaks near 3.7 ev , separately present in the plots of the corresponding energy - loss functions ( fig .",
    "[ sp0 ] ) , are never resolved from each other in our calculations , but they form a joint broadened peak with a contribution from the both types of excitations .",
    "this is in full agreement with the hreels experiments @xcite .",
    "a notable exception from the agreement between the theory and the experiment is the case of @xmath83 and @xmath86 , upper spectrum in fig .",
    "[ sp1 ] , when , surprisingly , the lower - energy plasmon peak , which is strong in the experimental spectrum , is absent in the theoretical one .    to examine the latter discrepancy closer , in fig .",
    "[ sp3 ] we plot theoretical spectra for the angle of scattering gradually changing from @xmath76 , when the peak in question is pronounced , to @xmath77 , when this peak disappears .",
    "these results show that the strength of the peak near 3.7 ev decreases systematically when the scattering angle @xmath87 increases .",
    "we note that a similar effect of the disappearance of the 3.7 ev peak with the growing momentum can be observed in the results of the calculations of ref .  , performed in the dipole - scattering mode within the same model of @xmath4-electrons .",
    "[ h ]    we analyze this tendency in detail in appendix [ prop ] to the conclusion that , although , the background df model is applicable in the higher energy range around 8 ev to account for the bulk , surface , and the multipole plasmons in ag@xcite , it fails for the lower - energy plasmons at larger values of the wave - vector .",
    "obviously , the future theory , which will include @xmath4-electrons from the first principles , will be free from this deficiency .    since our calculations based on eq .",
    "( [ dsdwdw ] ) are linear with respect to the interaction between the probe electron and the electronic subsystem of the target ( distorted - wave@xcite with the first born approximation for the inelastic processes ) , the multiple energy losses , e.g. , multiple plasmon excitations , are beyond the capacity of this approach .",
    "nonetheless , especially at higher primary energies , multiple losses can be expected in the experimental spectra . in fig .",
    "[ 8080 ] we plot the theoretical spectra together with the corresponding experimental ones for three different primary energies of 170 , 100 , and 70 ev at the specular geometry of @xmath88 , where we now focus on the higher energy range . while the theoretical lines are rather smooth in this range , the experimental spectra at @xmath89 170 and 100 ev have prominent peaks around 7.6 ev .",
    "considering that ( i ) the positions of these peaks are very close to the twice the energy of the strong single - plasmon peaks around 3.7 ev , ( ii ) their intensities change with @xmath90 consistently with those of the corresponding single - plasmon peaks , and ( iii ) these peaks are present in the experiment while absent in the linear - response based calculations , we are led to the conclusion that these peaks are due to the double - plasmon excitations .",
    "[ h ]    to reproduce the multiple plasmons theoretically , a theory of eels beyond the first born approximation is required .",
    "we note that the formal theory of inelastic scattering of a quantum - mechanical particle to the _ second _ born approximation , expressed in terms of the _ quadratic _ density - response function of a target , was constructed in ref .  .",
    "the practical implementations of this theory have not , however , been yet developed .",
    "we have revisited the problem of the energy losses by electrons in reflection electron energy - loss spectroscopy with the focus on the role of the probing electrons kinematics .",
    "the inadequacy of the description of eels in terms of the energy - loss functions has been emphasized for the materials where the bulk and the surface features overlap or are close in energy in the excitation spectra .",
    "we have implemented the theory including the effect of the detailed quantum - mechanical motion of the probe electrons during their energy losses , using ag surface as a representative example of a system where the kinematic aspect of the problem is particularly important .    since",
    "our primary interest lies in the role of the kinematic effects , for a sophisticated problem of the @xmath4-electrons response we have used a simplified model of the background dielectric function , which has immensely simplified the numerical implementation . as a side effect , although we have found a reasonably good overall agreement with hreels , at strongly off - specular geometries of the experiment , the theory and the measurements disagree .",
    "we have tracked this discrepancy down to the failure of the substitution of the @xmath4-electrons with the background dielectric function to describe the dispersion of the main loss feature of 3.7 ev in ag at larger values of the momentum .",
    "thus , the limits of the applicability of that , otherwise very useful model , have been set .",
    "this difficulty is anticipated to be overcome in the future theory , with all the ingredients included within the _ ab initio _ approach .",
    "another deviation of the theory from experiment we have found can be qualified as an evidence of the consistency of the former rather than its deficiency .",
    "namely , the experiment shows peaks at eel spectra that , by all the evidence , can be attributed to the double - plasmon excitations .",
    "the linear - response theory , which our approach is based on , fundamentally can not account for such losses , and we do not , accordingly , obtain the double - excitation peaks in the calculations .",
    "future implementations of the theory of the quadratic and higher - order response will be able to account for these processes .",

    "<S> we emphasize the equal importance of the second ingredient , pointing out the fundamental limitations of the conventionally used theoretical description of the electron energy - loss spectroscopy ( eels ) in terms of the `` energy - loss functions '' . </S>",
    "<S> our approach encompasses the dipole and impact scattering as specific cases , with the emphasis on the quantum - mechanical treatment of the probe electron . </S>",
    "<S> applied to the high - resolution eels of ag surface , our theory largely agrees with recent experiments , while some instructive exceptions are rationalized . </S>"
