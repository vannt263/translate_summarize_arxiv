    "in the last decade the studies about massive star forming regions have gained considerable attention .",
    "questions as whether the interaction of massive stars with their surrounding molecular clouds triggers the star formation have been amply discussed .",
    "the discovery of the `` infrared bubbles '' , a new type of object first cataloged through the glimpse @xcite at 8.0 @xmath0 m , offers a new powerful tool to investigate the star formation process .",
    "those objects present a bright border at 8.0 @xmath0 m , caused by the emission of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , excited by ultraviolet radiation ( uv ) , which surrounds a region of ionized gas @xcite .",
    "the bubbles were detected in observations performed by the spitzer satellite , in a survey that revealed about 600 bright objects at mid - infrared wavelengths @xcite .",
    "shortly afterwards the churchwell catalog were complemented by the milky way project ( mwp ) catalog by @xcite .",
    "this is the most recent scientific citizen - generated catalog , where the bubbles were identified by thousands of volunteers and therefore their classification is more reliable . @xcite",
    "have identified and studied a large sample of bubbles and concluded that the shell of each one , detected at 8.0 @xmath0 m , is an evidence of an hii region produced by the ionizing massive stars .",
    "@xcite suggested that the expansion of the bubbles triggers the formation of young stellar objects ( ysos ) which is a non - negligible process in galactic scales .",
    "@xcite also have observed this behavior and , although evidences of triggering via bubble expansion were missing , these authors found populations of ysos near the borders of expanding bubbles , which could offer us important clues to the star formation process and the expansion of infrared bubbles .",
    "we can interpret these bubbles as basically ionized gas surrounded by cold dust .",
    "a photon - dominated region ( pdr ) in the inner regions of the shell , can be identified and described at mid - infrared wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the pdrs can be the result of the hii region expansion .",
    "they can be seen as regions where the ionization front is still progressing in the densest medium of the original cloud , generating an interface between ionized and neutral gases .",
    "the larger density in the pdr is possibly due to material collected by the expansion of the hii region . in this region",
    "the uv flux decreases sharply , allowing the existence of molecular and grain species .",
    "the massive stars interact with the original molecular cloud and , by their uv radiation , generate the interface between ionized gas and neutral gas .    in principle , the structure of the objects , should it be spherical shells or rings , allow us to understand correctly the kinematics of the gas and the chronology of the newly formed stars .",
    "several works claimed that there was evidence for star formation triggered by the expansion of the hii region @xcite .",
    "@xcite found velocity differences of the order of 30 km s@xmath3 between distinct parts of the ring in the bubble n6 , which would indicate a quite larger expansion velocity than those considered by other authors , of a few km s@xmath3 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . @xcite and",
    "@xcite carried out simulations to study the effects of stellar feedback in molecular clouds .",
    "they suggested that it is not possible to determine if the formation of an yso was triggered or not by the expansion of the hii region and as a consequence studies of triggered star formation should be done statistically .",
    "therefore , it is important to gather a number of well studied bubbles to establish if they have similar formation histories , if they have similar morphology and if they give similar answers to the process about triggered star formation .    in this work we present a detailed study of , a remarkable bubble which has molecular clumps and ysos associated with its surrounding shell .",
    "we present our co observations and we analyze them together with the relevant data at different wavelengths : 8.0 @xmath0 m , pah emission ; 24 @xmath0 m , hot grains from ionized region ; 870 @xmath0 m , dust emission ; and 20 cm free - free emission , from hot gas .",

    "the 8.0 @xmath0 m emission in the border of bubbles is attributed to pdrs containing pahs ; the gas density in the pdr can be much larger ( up to a factor 10 ) than that of the surrounding medium @xcite . in figure [ n10_8microns ] we show an ellipse to mark the boundaries of the bubble , for later reference in images at different wavelengths .",

    "we found 565 wise sources in this area .",
    "we next filtered this list of sources by applying a serie of quality criteria defined by kl , that they call the uncertainty / signal - to - noise / chi - squared criteria .",
    "the purpose of this is to avoid regions in the space of these parameters with relatively high probability of spurious catalog entry .",
    "accordingly , the class i ysos are classified as such if their color matches with all the following criteria :    * @xmath112 ; * @xmath113 ; * @xmath114 ; * @xmath115 .",
    "these conditions reflect the divisions in the sed slope @xmath116 .",
    "the class ii objects were also classified according to kl , whose criteria are :    * @xmath117 ; * @xmath118 ; * @xmath119 ; * @xmath115 .",
    "for w3 we kept only the condition of s / n larger than 5 .",
    "it is considered that if a source satisfies the criteria of being a true source in any one of the bands , it has little probability of being a fake one and will be included in the final list . after this filtering the list of sources reduced to 407 entries .",
    "next step was to separate the sources into class i , class ii , transition disks and remaining objects .",
    "following kl , the class i and class ii ysos are classified as such , based on the w1-w2 versus w2-w3 color - color diagram only .",
    "the regions of the diagram that are used to classify the ysos are defined by a number of frontier lines , shown in figure [ ccdiag_01 ] .",
    "the equations of the lines are given by kl ( their equations 12 to 20 ) .",
    "we found 12 class i stars and 91 class ii sources .",
    "the transition disk stars are selected separately by means of the w1-w2 versus w2-w3 color - color diagram as shown in figure [ ccdiag_02 ] .",
    "we found 131 transition disk stars .",
    "note that the selection criteria follow an order of priority : a class i object will remain class i even if it also satisfies the criterion for class ii , and next the class ii selection prevails over the following selection .",
    "this is why we find many class ii objects in the box defining transition disk stars in figure [ ccdiag_02 ] : they were classified class ii in the previous step , on the basis of the different color - color plot .",
    "this selection of class i objects is robust , since these objects are well separated from the other classes in the color diagrams .",
    "furthermore , we made experiments with another classification scheme available in the literature ( using spitzer data , e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and the same class i objects were retrieved . on the other hand , the distinction between class ii and transition disk is a little arbitrary , as we can see some overlap in figures [ ccdiag_01 ] and [ ccdiag_02 ] . in the samples of objects previously known to belong to given classes , used by kl to decide the position of the frontier lines in figures [ ccdiag_01 ] and [ ccdiag_02 ]",
    ", one can see a number of transition disk sources in the locus of class ii and vice versa .",
    "so , one must consider that the decision to attribute sources to one or the other classes is only valid in a statistical sense , being correct in about 70% of the cases .",
    "we have compared the position of class i ysos , the most embedded young stellar sources , with the molecular distribution and the objects identified from # 1 to # 9 ( see table [ all_ysos ] ) are more likely to be physically related to n10 molecular structure .",
    "we have fitted their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) by using the online tool developed by @xcite .",
    "radiation transfer models were fitted to observational data extracted from wise catalog based on a @xmath120 test .",
    "we selected models for which @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the minimum value and @xmath123 is the number of input data .",
    "the fitting was performed using fluxes from wise data , distance ranges from 4.23 to 5.17 kpc .",
    "interstellar extinction in the direction of was predict to be approximately 10.7 mag according to model s of @xcite , values adopted were from 9.7 to 11.7 mag .",
    "the best fit are shown in figure [ sed_fitting ] .",
    "resulting values for model parameters are given in table [ model - parameters ] .",
