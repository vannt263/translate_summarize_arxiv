    "one of the outstanding problems facing high energy physics is the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking . although the usual higgs mechanism , which employs a single weak scalar isodoublet , is phenomenologically successful@xcite it is not theoretically satisfying .",
    "is it possible to generate the masses for the gauge bosons and fermions of the standard model(sm ) without encountering fine - tuning and naturalness issues as well as the associated hierarchy problem ? on the experimental side , we expect that the lhc should begin to probe for answers to these important questions over the next few years with potentially surprising results . while we wait , it is important for us to examine as many scenarios as possible which address these issues in order to prepare ourselves for these critically important terascale experimental results .",
    "grinstein , oconnell and wise(gow)@xcite have recently extended to the sm context an old idea by lee and wick(lw)@xcite based on higher - derivative theories .",
    "this model apparently solves the hierarchy problem and eliminates the quadratic divergence of the higgs boson mass that one ordinarily encounters in the sm .",
    "the most essential feature of the gow scenario is the introduction of negative - normed states into the usual sm hilbert space . in particular , one introduces a new massive degree of freedom ( or one vector - like pair in the fermion case ) for each of the conventional sm particles with the same spin .",
    "the resulting contributions of these exotic new particles to the higgs mass quadratic divergence then cancels those of the sm , partner by partner , leaving only safe logarithmic terms . in the gauge sector , , the following new fields are introduced : an @xmath1 octet of ` gluons ' , @xmath2 , with mass @xmath3 , an @xmath4 isotriplet of weak bosons , @xmath5 , of mass @xmath6 and a heavy neutral @xmath7 hypercharge field , @xmath8 , with mass @xmath9 .",
    "the interactions of these new fields with each other and with the familiar ones of the sm are given in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "gow argue that due to naturalness requirements and the present direct@xcite and indirect@xcite experimental constraints on the existence of such particles , one should anticipate that their masses must lie not too far above @xmath10 tev .",
    "the implications of such a scenario have been examined in a number of recent works@xcite .    within this context ,",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to address a purely phenomenological issue .",
    "as long as such states are not too massive , since their interactions are very similar to those of their conventional sm counterparts , it is already clear that they will be produced _ and _ observed at the lhc based on the results of other existing analyses@xcite . due to their rather strange and unusual properties",
    ", one might imagine that it would be rather trivial for lhc experimental data to be used to uniquely identify such states as arising from the gow framework .",
    "however , it was shown in an earlier work@xcite that this is not the case in the gauge boson sector due to the possible ambiguities in the signs of the couplings of new gauge bosons to the sm fermions .",
    "the issue we want to address in this paper is whether or not this situation can be overcome at future @xmath0 colliders , , can we tell that we have unambiguously observed these negative - metric lw fields and not something else ?",
    "we will demonstrate that measurements of the bhabha scattering process will allow us to answer this question conclusively in the affirmative .",
    "since we will be considering @xmath0 collisions , our attention will be focused on the new neutral electroweak gauge bosons in the gow model .",
    "the essential phenomenological features of these new states is straightforward to summarize : ( @xmath11 ) the propagators and decay widths of the relevant lw particles , @xmath12 , have signs which are opposite to those of the familiar sm fields ; ( @xmath13 ) the couplings of these lw gauge fields to sm fermions are exactly those of the corresponding sm gauge fields ; ( @xmath14 ) in the limit that @xmath15 , as will be the case discussed below , the mixing between the sm and gow gauge bosons can be neglected .",
    "when ( @xmath11 ) and ( @xmath13 ) are taken together they imply a strong destructive interference between the sm and gow amplitudes that can be symbolically written as @xmath16 apart from other overall factors .",
    "in particular the width @xmath17 has exactly the same magnitude as would a heavy copy of the relevant sm gauge field .",
    "note that here we have assumed that the decays of these heavy gauge bosons into pairs of the lw partners of the sm fermions is not kinematically allowed . in this case ,",
    "the width to mass ratio of these new gauge bosons is quite small @xmath18 .",
    "if such decays are allowed , only the widths of the new gauge states are modified and not their couplings to the sm fields which is what we wish to explore below . if decays to some of these fermions",
    "are allowed , we would still expect that @xmath19 or so .",
    "this overall situation is somewhat reminiscent of what happens in the sequential sm(ssm)@xcite or the case of flat , tev - scale extra dimensions where the fermions are confined to the origin of the fifth dimension ( apart from an additional numerical factor@xcite of @xmath20 which might be modified by the existence of brane - localized kinetic terms@xcite ) .",
    "a small , but important , difference here is that for the general case when @xmath21 , the two fields @xmath22 and @xmath8 will be the true mass eigenstates and we shall generally use this basis in what follows . to see this , we note that the angle describing the mixing between these two states is given by@xcite @xmath23^{-1}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 are the usual @xmath4 and @xmath7 sm couplings with @xmath25 the sm higgs vev .",
    "when @xmath9 and @xmath6 are substantially different , this mixing is quite small , , of order @xmath26 or less .",
    "however , when @xmath27 , a special case that we will consider below , the angle @xmath28 is large and is seen to be identical with the usual weak mixing angle , @xmath29 .",
    "clearly , mixing must be included in this case in any phenomenological analysis .    before beginning our analysis",
    "let us remind the reader about the source of the ambiguities encountered at the lhc . due to our particular interests below we focus on the the neutral electroweak gauge boson sector though the same problems arise for all gauge sectors .",
    "the primary way to observe a new gauge field with sm - like couplings at the lhc is in the drell - yan channel@xcite . as an example , let us consider the production and decay of heavy @xmath30-like states at the lhc , comparing three possibilities : @xmath31 the new fields are exact but heavier duplicates of the ones in the sm and , as discussed above , might occur in models with extra dimensions , @xmath32 they are lw - type fields , or @xmath33 they are sm - like fields _ but _ the overall relative sign between , , the initial state quarks and the final state leptonic couplings is opposite to that of the sm .",
    "as discussed in our earlier work@xcite , it was noted that such a situation could arise in models@xcite where fermions are localized on two different branes bounding an extra flat dimension .",
    "note that for the following phenomemological discussion , these alternatives to the lw model are treated only as ` strawmen ' against which the lw predictions can be tested . in the resonance region(s ) these three scenarios are essentially identical producing resonances with exactly the same ( apparent ) widths and branching fractions and with the same angular distributions for the outgoing leptons .",
    "below the resonances , @xmath31 differs from @xmath32 and @xmath33 since there is strong destructive interference in this case whereas the other two scenarios lead to constructive interference with the sm photon and @xmath34 exchanges .",
    "thus case @xmath31 can be distinguished from cases @xmath32 and @xmath33 by measuring the cross section in this interference region .",
    "however , cases @xmath32 and @xmath33 are found to be indistinguishable ; algebraically , the corresponding amplitudes in these two cases differ only in the sign of the imaginary parts in the @xmath22 and @xmath8 contributions which are sufficiently small in comparison to other terms in the amplitude as to be impossible to observe@xcite even at very high lhc integrated luminosities .",
    "can we get around this problem at an @xmath0 collider and separate all three of these possibilities , uniquely establishing the identity of the lw states ?",
    "this is the issue to which we now turn .",
    "to begin our analysis and to be as general as possible let us first imagine that we have available to us an @xmath0 collider with an adjustable center of mass energy in the tev range which will follow in the wake of the lhc .",
    "consider the set of processes @xmath35 where @xmath36 is any sm fermion .",
    "then it is well known@xcite that for any ( massless ) fermion , @xmath37 , the born - level production differential cross section for unpolarized @xmath38 due to the @xmath39-channel exchange of any number of ( ordinary ) neutral gauge bosons can be written as @xmath40\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is a color factor , @xmath42 , the angle being between @xmath43 and @xmath36 , with @xmath44 with @xmath45 being the vector and axial vector couplings of @xmath46 and @xmath36 to the @xmath11th gauge boson and @xmath47[i\\to j]}}\\,,\\ ] ] is the corresponding propagator factor . here",
    "@xmath48 are the mass ( width ) of the @xmath11th gauge boson . for polarized beams , a similar set of expressions",
    "can be written down to construct the left - right polarization asymmetry , @xmath49 ; to do this we make the replacements @xmath50 and then form the ratio @xmath51\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the effective beam polarization . in the calculations below we will set @xmath53 for simplicity .",
    "let us now consider the three models @xmath54 in this environment ; the expressions above apply directly to cases @xmath31 and @xmath33 as the gauge fields in these two cases are ` ordinary ' .",
    "as at the lhc , we see that flipping the relative sign of the initial / final fermion couplings of the @xmath55 and @xmath56 will change the the cross section in the interference region both below and above the resonances .",
    "this is shown explicitly in figs .",

    "it is clear from this exercise that the cross sections for scenarios @xmath32 and @xmath33 will differ by construction only in the sign of the terms proportional to the products @xmath64 . note that the resulting cross section for the lw case , @xmath32 , is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] lying directly on top of that for scenario @xmath33 , repeating our lhc experience .",

    "this depends upon , , the potential relative schedules of the ilc and clic as well as many other known and unknown unknowns .",
    "however , it is clear that at the first stage of the ilc , we will likely be limited to values of @xmath80 gev so that the properties of these new gauge bosons can only be indirectly studied in bhabha scattering .",
