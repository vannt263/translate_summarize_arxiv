    "bose - fermi degeneracy is well known to be a consequence of supersymmetry .",
    "however , it is not a feature one expects in a non - supersymmetric theory .",
    "so it is very interesting that , recently , kachru , kumar and silverstein @xcite constructed a @xmath1-dimensional non - supersymmetric type ii string model ( the kks model ) which has this bose - fermi degeneracy feature , _",
    "i.e. _ , the number of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom are equal at every mass level of the spectrum . in this paper",
    ", we construct a set of string models that also share this same feature .",
    "the models are non - supersymmetric @xmath1-dimensional type ii string models , constructed as asymmetric @xmath0 orbifolds .",
    "such models are easy to construct , using the free fermionic string model construction @xcite . starting from the @xmath1-dimensional @xmath2 supersymmetric ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath3 ) type ii model , we introduce a @xmath4 twist which breaks the supersymmetry to @xmath5 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath6 ) . on the other hand",
    ", we can introduce a different @xmath7 twist on the original @xmath8 model .",
    "judicious choices of these two twists result in non - supersymmetric @xmath0 orbifold models with zero one - loop partition functions .",
    "it turns out that there are two inequivalent types of @xmath7 twist that satisfy the requirements .",
    "the first type of @xmath7 twist breaks supersymmetry to @xmath5 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath9 ) .",
    "the @xmath7 twist in ref .",
    "@xcite belongs to this type .",
    "the other type of @xmath7 twist breaks supersymmetry to @xmath10 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath11 ) .",
    "in contrast to the model in ref .",
    "@xcite where the one - loop partition function vanishes because of the non - abelian nature of the orbifold , the one - loop vanishing in the @xmath0 orbifolds presented here is due to the fermionic zero mode .",
    "another novel feature of this set of models is that there are massless twisted sector states . despite the fact that the models are non - supersymmetric ( as the gravitinos are all projected out ) , the twisted sector states seem to fall into appropriate supermultiplets .    the non - trivial question about these models is whether the cosmological constant remains zero at higher loops . using an approach similar to that given in ref@xcite",
    ", we demonstrate that the cosmological constant vanishes at two - loops ( with the two - loop integrand vanishing point - wise in the moduli space ) .",
    "the structure of the models naturally leads to the conjecture that this property ( _ i.e. _ , vanishing multi - loop integrand ) persists to all loops .",
    "we give a plausible argument for this conjecture .",
    "let us assume that the cosmological constant does vanish to all orders in the perturbation expansion .",
    "each model actually represents a class of such models , since they have scalar fields that are moduli , _",
    "i.e. _ , the cosmological constant remains zero for different choices of the scalar field expectation values .",
    "the existence of a set of such models with this feature strongly suggests an underlying stringy symmetry that remains to be identified .",
    "some duality aspects of these types of models have been explored recently @xcite .",
    "in particular , kachru and silverstein show that the kks model is self - dual . here",
    "we generalize their analysis to more intricate situations .",
    "some care is necessary to distinguish seemingly similar models ( with the same orbifold twists and the same counting of states in the spectra ) which have diferent gso projections ( due to discrete torsions ) , and hence give rise to different spectra . _ a priori _",
    ", they have different duality properties , reminiscent of the situation of type iia / iib .",
    "this allows us to reproduce the self - duality property of the kks model , and in addition , construct a new strong - weak dual ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath12-dual ) pair , both of which have bose - fermi degeneracy .",
    "we argue that at least some of the non - perturbative corrections to the cosmological constants are absent .",
    "the existence of these models further suggests that it may not be too difficult to arrange realistic non - supersymmetric models with zero cosmological constant . in the realistic universe",
    ", the cosmological constant has to vanish only at an isolated point in the field space , which is a much more relaxed constraint . even if the cosmological constant vanishes in perturbative expansion , it may still receive a non - perturbative contribution . at weak coupling",
    ", we expect at most an exponentially suppressed cosmological constant , which may be consistent with nature .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ prelim ] ,",
    "we review the rules of the free fermionic string model construction .",
    "we follow the notation of ref@xcite .",
    "readers who are familiar with orbifolds but not familiar with the fermionic string construction may skip this section , since we will give a translation between the two languages later on . in section [ models ] , we give the explicit constructions of the models .",
    "it is illuminating to show how the massless spectra emerge under the various asymmetric @xmath4 twists .",
    "they are shown in the tables . in section [ duality ]",
    ", we show that one of the models constructed is self - dual .",
    "that model is similar to the kks model .",
    "we also show that two of the models form a dual pair . in section [ multiloop ]",
    ", we briefly discuss the issues of multi - loop contributions to the cosmological constant , and demonstrate the vanishing of the two - loop vacuum amplitude .",

    "readers who are familiar with orbifolds but not familiar with the fermionic string construction may also skip this section , since a translation between the two languages is given in section [ models ] . in what follows",
    ", we will concentrate on type ii string vacua with four non - compact space - time dimensions in the light - cone rns formulation . in the free - fermionic construction ,",
    "all of the world - sheet degrees of freedom corresponding to the compactified six space - like dimensions are fermionized .",
    "moreover , these degrees of freedom are described via _",
    "free _ world - sheet fermions , which are written in the complex basis , with various spin structures , that is , boundary conditions .",
    "we have the following world - sheet degrees of freedom : one complex world - sheet boson @xmath13 corresponding to two real transverse space - time coordinates in the light - cone gauge ; one complex fermion @xmath14 which is the world - sheet superpartner of @xmath13 ; three pairs of complex fermions @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 , corresponding to fermionization of three complex ( six real ) world - sheet bosons @xmath18 describing the compactified dimensions ; three complex world - sheet fermions @xmath19 which are superpartners of the world - sheet bosons @xmath18 .",
    "since we are discussing type ii strings , each of the above world - sheet degrees of freedom has a left- and right - moving component which we will denote by subscripts `` @xmath20 '' and `` @xmath21 '' , respectively .    in the following discussion",
    "we will mostly deal with the world - sheet fermions @xmath22",
    ". we will collectively refer to them as @xmath23 , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "similar notation will be used for the corresponding left- and right - moving components as well .",
    "it is convenient to organize the string states into sectors labeled by the monodromies of the world - sheet degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , consider the sector where @xmath29 note that @xmath30 since @xmath13 corresponds to space - time coordinates .",
    "these monodromies can be combined into a single vector @xmath31~.\\ ] ] the double vertical line separates the monodromies corresponding to the left- and right - moving components . without loss of generality we can restrict the values of @xmath32 as follows : @xmath33 . note that if a given monodromy is @xmath34 then the corresponding world - sheet degree of freedom is a complex ramond fermion ; if this monodromy is 0 , then it is a neveu - schwarz complex fermion .",
    "the monodromies @xmath35 can be viewed as fields @xmath23 being periodic @xmath36 up to the identification @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is an element of a finite discrete _ orbifold _ group @xmath39 . in this paper",
    "we will only consider abelian orbifold groups @xmath39 .",
    "in fact , we will focus on orbifold groups which are direct products of @xmath4 subgroups . in these cases",
    "all the @xmath35 vectors only have elements taking values 0 or @xmath34 .",
    "the requirement of world - sheet supersymmetry is necessary to ensure space - time lorentz invariance in the covariant gauge , which implies that the world - sheet supercurrents must have well defined monodromies .",
    "that is , for @xmath17 : @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 determine whether the corresponding space - time states are bosons or fermions : the ns - ns sectors with @xmath43 as well as the r - r sectors with @xmath44 give rise to space - time bosons ; the ns - r sectors with @xmath45 as well as the r - ns sectors with @xmath46 give rise to space - time fermions .",
    "the notation we have introduced proves convenient in describing the sectors of a given string model with an orbifold group @xmath39 .",
    "as we have already mentioned , we will confine our attention to the orbifold groups @xmath47 so that all the elements @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) are either 0 or @xmath34 . here",
    "@xmath50 for @xmath51 , and @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",

    "the elements @xmath67 of the group @xmath39 are in one - to - one correspondence with the vectors @xmath64 .",
    "it is the abelian nature of @xmath39 that allows for this correspondence by simply taking all possible linear combinations of the generating vectors @xmath35 .",
    "now we can identify the sectors of a given model .",
    "they are labeled by the vectors @xmath64 , and in a given sector @xmath64 the monodromies of the string degrees of freedom are given by @xmath68 .",
    "the sectors with @xmath69 give rise to space - time bosons , whereas the sectors with @xmath70 give rise to space - time fermions .    in the next section",

    "such a model ( subject to the consistency conditions discussed in the subsequent sections ) corresponds to a four dimensional type iia or type iib string theory ( depending on certain phases entering the one - loop partition function - see below ) with @xmath2 space - time supersymmetry .    as mentioned before",
    ", we will focus on orbifold groups that are direct products of @xmath4 subgroups .",
    "hence the boundary conditions of the complex fermions @xmath76 can only take values @xmath77 or @xmath78 .",
    "this implies that the worldsheet fermions do not need to be written in the complex basis ( in contrast to other @xmath79 orbifolds where the monodromies are complex and so a complex basis of the fermions is necessary ) . in cases where the worldsheet degrees of freedom contain real fermions ,",
    "the generating set @xmath55 must satisfy the _",
    "constraint @xcite : @xmath80 this ensures that we can find a complex basis for any three generating vectors , even though there is no complex basis which is common for _ all _ the generating vectors .",

    "+ @xmath206 for @xmath333 and @xmath334 , the original model is strongly coupled and at a small radius .",

    "one can further deduce from string duality that at least some of the non - perturbative corrections to the cosmological constant are absent . _ a priori _ , there can be non - perturbative corrections to the cosmological constant for finite @xmath289 . for instance , there may be non - zero contribution due to an unequal number ( or masses ) of bosonic and fermionic solitonic states coming from the ns fivebranes wrapped on @xmath271 .",
    "let us consider the limit when @xmath288 is large . in this limit ,",
    "the dual model is weakly coupled ( @xmath331 ) and the perturbative contributions in the dual model vanish for arbitrary @xmath332 due to the bose - fermi degeneracy , while the non - perturbative contributions in the dual model are exponentially suppressed .",
    "since eq .",
    "( [ barg ] ) maps the ns fivebranes wrapped on @xmath271 to the fundamental strings ( without winding on the @xmath271 ) in the dual model @xcite , the contribution from this type of solitonic states also obey bose - fermi degeneracy . as a result , the non - perturbative corrections due to this type of wrapped ns fivebranes are absent due to bose - fermi degeneracy",
    ".    it will be interesting to find out whether the ia model has exactly zero cosmological constant or not , that is , whether all its solitionic contributions obey bose - fermi degeneracy . as first pointed out by harvey @xcite ,",
    "duality is a powerful tool in addressing this issue .",
    "however , it is not clear that all duals are relevant to the above question . in particular",
    ", the heterotic dual @xcite of a type ii model with bose - fermi degeneracy has a non - zero one - loop cosmological constant .",
    "naively , this implies a non - vanishing dilaton potential , which is non - perturbative in the original type ii coupling .",
    "however , there is a barrier ( hence a tachyon ) as the dilaton expectation value interpolates between this particular dual pair .",
    "it is then not clear that , both away and around the barrier , the non - vanishing cosmological constant can be interpreted as coming from a set of solitonic states of the type ii model . if the dual pair is not connected by varying parameters in the non - perturbative string model , it may not shed light on the solitonic bose - fermi degeneracy issue .",
    "a non - zero cosmological constant coming from the solitonic sector is exponentially suppressed in the coupling . since the coupling in nature is rather small , a non - perturbative cosmological constant may be perfectly harmless phenomenologically .",
    "since model ia@xmath260 , ia@xmath263 and ia@xmath266 have different duality properties under the map eq .",
    "( [ barg ] ) , it is interesting to understand further the relations between these models . recall that these models differ only in the structure constants @xmath224 and @xmath225 which can take values @xmath77 or @xmath78 . in the orbifold language ,",
    "@xmath264 correponds to including @xmath163 in the action of @xmath139 .",
    "similarly , @xmath262 corresponds to including @xmath167 in the action of @xmath81 .",
    "let us start with model ia@xmath266 which has @xmath267 .",
    "consider @xmath288-dualizing one of the circles in @xmath227 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath336 .",

    "similarly , model ia@xmath263 can be obtained from model ia@xmath266 by first interchanging the left- and right - moving worldsheet degrees of freedom and then @xmath288-dualizing the action of @xmath139 . as a result ,",
    "the various models are then related by an intricate web of dualities :    = 10 cm    where @xmath12 is the @xmath12-duality operator defined in eq .",
    "( [ barg ] ) , @xmath288 and @xmath340 are two different @xmath288-duality operators",
    ".    it would be interesting to work out the duality properties of the other models ( _ i.e. _ ib , iib and iic ) presented in this paper .",
    "the question whether the cosmological constants of the models constructed above vanish beyond one - loop is clearly important .",
    "unfortunately , we are not able to give a definitive answer to this question , due to the subtleties involved in the multi - loop calculations .",
    "we can summarize the situation as follows .",
    "the calculation of the two - loop cosmological constant of the above models is exactly parallel to that of the model in ref@xcite . if we take the gauge choice in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is straightforward to demonstrate the vanishing of the cosmological constant ; in fact , the two - loop integrand vanishes point - wise in the moduli space",
    ". a naive generalization of the two - loop argument actually yields the point - wise vanishing of the multi - loop integrand in the vacuum amplitude . however , there is no proof of the validity of the particular gauge choice beyond two - loops .",
    "so , whether the cosmological constants of the these models vanish beyond one - loop hinges on the legitimacy of the particular gauge choice .",
    "since we do not have any particularly intelligent observations to make on this point , our discussions here will be brief .",
    "in evaluating the g - loop string vacuum amplitude , we are evaluating the amplitude associated with genus - g riemann surfaces .",
    "the amplitude has a holomorphic and a similar anti - holomorphic part , and we may consider them separately in the discussion . in the covariant formulation ,",
    "it is necessary to insert @xmath341 picture - changing operators , which correspond to the integration of the odd moduli and/or absorb the zero modes of the @xmath99 superghost @xcite .",
    "moving the positions @xmath342 of these insertion points changes the integrand in the vacuum amplitude by a total derivative . in this sense , we see the choice of @xmath342 as pure gauge choices .",
    "for arbitrary @xmath342 , the modes along the longitudinal and the time directions are not cancelled by the ( super-)ghost modes ( except in the one - loop case , where there is no picture - changing operator insertion ) , _ i.e. _ , their respective theta functions do not cancel .",
    "however , in the light - cone gauge , we have neither longitudinal / time nor ghost modes .",
    "so we expect that there must exist a choice of the positions @xmath342 so that the theta functions from the longitudinal / time modes cancel that from the ghost modes .",
    "the choice that is closest to this picture is the so called `` unitary '' gauge @xcite , @xmath343 where @xmath344 is a riemannn constant . for generic values of @xmath342 satifying this unitary gauge condition ,",
    "the theta functions still do not exactly cancel .",
    "in the two - loop case , there is a @xmath345 dependence in the integrand .",
    "now let us look at the situation in the light - cone gauge . recall that a picture - changing supercurrent must be inserted at each interaction vertex @xcite .",
    "since there are @xmath341 vertices in the g - loop diagram , we see that such insertions are an intrinsic part of the multi - loop light - cone amplitudes , _",
    "i.e. _ , the @xmath346 dependence in the two - loop case is not unexpected .    the consistency of the unitary gauge has been demonstrated in ref@xcite . in particular ,",
    "modular invariance has been shown for generic choices of @xmath342 satisfying the unitary gauge condition . in ref@xcite ,",
    "the further choice is made for the two - loop case @xcite @xmath347 this choice is perfectly reasonable .",
    "since the cosmological constant does not depend on @xmath345 , and there is no integration over @xmath342 in the evaluation of the cosmological constant , the @xmath346 dependence must be a pure gauge choice .",
    "different choices simply gives different total derivative terms , and the total derivative term in this gauge is simply zero .",
    "now , under the dehn twist , the phase factor @xmath348 $ ] in eq .",
    "( [ mod2 ] ) needed for modular invariance is apparently absent in this @xmath349 gauge , _",
    "i.e. _ , modular invariance is obscure . to resolve this ambiguity",
    ", we shall employ the following point - split approach . to carry out the dehn twist , we first split @xmath350 and @xmath351 , do the modular transformation , and then take the limit @xmath349 again . in this gauge choice",
    ", the cosmological constant of the non - supersymmetric string model constructed in ref@xcite is shown to be zero ( the two - loop integrand vanishes point - wise ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , and similarly for the models given in this paper .",
    "we shall demonstrate the point - wise vanishing of the two - loop integrand , using the above defined modular transformation .",
    "we also give an argument for the vanishing of the higher loop vacuum amplitudes .",
    "the argument relies on the assumption that even for higher loops , we can always go to the unitary gauge ( at least locally on the riemann surface ) in which the combined contribution of the ghost and longitudinal components is spin structure independent .",
    "this may be achieved with the special choice of @xmath352 .",
    "again , the higher - loop integrand vanishes point - wise in the moduli space .",
    "this is the basis of our conjecture that the cosmological constant vanishes to all orders in the perturbation expansion .      in the following ,",
    "we give an argument for the vanishing of the two - loop amplitude . for our considerations , we only need to worry about diagrams that involve both @xmath139 and @xmath81 twists .",
    "other diagrams which involve only one type of @xmath4 twist do not break supersymmetry and hence give no contribution to the cosmological constant .",
    "one can show that by multi - loop modular transformation , any twist that breaks space - time supersymmetry can be brought to one of the canonical forms : @xmath353 and @xmath354 where the twists are around the @xmath355 cycles .",
    "we will show in the following that for twists of the first type , the two - loop contribution vanishes ( before summing over the spin structures ) because of the fermionic zero modes  at least one of the @xmath202 worldsheet fermions has odd spin structure , whose theta function is identically zero . for twists of the second type , part of the two - loop contribution vanishes because of the fermionic zero modes , and the remaining contributions vanish ( after summing over the spin structures of the first torus ) due to the @xmath178 supersymmetry ( the supersymmetry that remains after only the @xmath139 twist ) .",
    "let us first consider the twist of the first type _",
    "i.e. _ , the @xmath139 and @xmath81 twists are around the @xmath83- and @xmath84-cycle respectively of only one of the tori .",
    "the worldsheet fermions can naturally be divided into four groups : @xmath356    in each of the above groups , the worldsheet fermions have the same boundary conditions on the tori where the @xmath139 and @xmath81 twists do not act ( since the only generating vectors are @xmath73 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 on these tori ) . as a result ,",
    "the fermions in the same group have the same @xmath357-loop spin structure , _",
    "i.e. _ , they all have odd spin structure or even spin structure .",
    "one the other hand , one can easily show that for at least one of the groups , the fermions in the same group must have opposite spin structure in the torus that both @xmath139 and @xmath81 act .",
    "the implication is that no matter what the @xmath357-loop spin structure of this group of fermions is , we can always find fermions within the group such that the total spin structure is odd .",
    "since the @xmath81-loop @xmath358 function for odd spin structure is zero , we conclude that the @xmath81-loop amplitudes of this type of diagrams vanish .",
    "it remains to show that the contribution of the other type of twists is zero . to show this ,",
    "let us consider @xmath359 but @xmath360 .",
    "in this limit , the combined contribution of the ghosts and longitudinal compoents does not have spin structure dependence . the @xmath81-loop amplitude with @xmath139 and @xmath81 twists around the @xmath83-cycles of two adjacent tori",
    "is given by @xmath361 where @xmath362 , @xmath363 , @xmath364 for @xmath365 and @xmath366 for @xmath367 .",
    "consider the two characters with the same @xmath368 and @xmath369 except for @xmath370 : + @xmath206   @xmath371  ; + @xmath206   @xmath372  .",
    "+ they have the same theta function dependence ( as only the roles of @xmath373 and @xmath374 are interchanged ) .",
    "the corresponding phases @xmath375 differ by a factor of @xmath376 .",
    "if @xmath377 or @xmath378 then the two terms in the @xmath81-loop amplitude have opposite signs and so they cancel .",
    "if @xmath379 and @xmath380 , the two terms do not cancel . in this case , however , the fermions in group @xmath223 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath381 , have periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath84-cycle of the first torus .",
    "on the other hand , around the @xmath83-cycle of the first torus , some of the fermions in group @xmath223 have periodic boundary conditions and some have anti - periodic boundary conditions . as a result , there are fermions with odd and even spin structure in the first torus",
    ". therefore , no matter what the spin structure of the @xmath357-loop amplitude is , there are always fermions with @xmath81-loop odd spin structure , and hence the @xmath81-loop amplitude vanishes due to the fermionic zero mode .",
    "duality of non - supersymmetric strings have been studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "we see that the models with the bose - fermi degeneracy feature are under better control . using free fermionic construction ,",
    "we have constructed a set of non - supersymmetric string models with the property that the number of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom are equal at each mass level . since the models are constructed as _ abelian _ orbifolds ( in contrast to the non - abelian orbifold in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , explicit calculations of the couplings and @xmath257-point amplitudes would be easier to carry out .",
    "the vanishing of the cosmological constant in the models has a natural explanation in string theory it is simply a remnant of the @xmath203-dimensional supersymmetry that defines type ii string theory .",
    "the exact form of this stringy symmetry remains to be identified .",
    "understanding this symmetry would help in constructing more realistic non - supersymmetric models in which the cosmological constant vanishes only at an isolated point of the moduli space ( instead of having free moduli as in the present case ) .",
    "another motivation for considering non - supersymmetric strings with vanishing cosmological constant is the recent interests in tev scale superstings @xcite . in this new scenario ,",
    "gauge and gravitational couplings can unify at the string scale which can be as low as a tev .",
    "this means the hierarchy problem is absent and so supersymmetry is no longer needed .",
    "( this is a relief , since dynamical supersymmetry breaking in string theory is poorly understood ) .",
    "it is therefore important to explore non - supersymmetric models with certain realistic features , for instance , vanishing ( or very small ) cosmological constant .",
    "however , a realistic model would require non - abelian gauge group which is absent in perturbative type ii string theory .",
    "it would be interesting to work out the d - brane spectrum ( which can give rise to non - abelian gauge group ) and see if the vanishing of the cosmological constant still persists in the presence of d - branes .",
