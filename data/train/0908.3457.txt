    "the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy 1h0707 - 495 ( z=0.0411 ; @xcite ) has been a popular target for x - ray observations due to its enigmatic spectrum and high variability .",
    "most attention has been focused on spectral features above 6  kev , which have been interpreted as being due to either deep partial covering absorption ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or relativistically - broadened fe  k@xmath2 line emission from the inner accretion disc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "most recently , analysis of a large xmm - newton dataset has supported the relativistic discline interpretation for the spectral and variability properties , and has also shown that the soft x - ray band contains a feature consistent with a discline from fe - l , the first ever such detection @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate a @xmath0380  ks high - resolution soft x - ray rgs spectrum from the january - february 2008 xmm - newton observations of 1h0707 - 495 .",
    "rgs spectra of seyferts frequently contain narrow line absorption from ionised winds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , narrow line emission from a kiloparsec - scale region co - spatial with the optical narrow line region ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , and sometimes also broader emission lines ( see  e.g. * ? ? ? *  and  references  therein ) .",
    "these latter features have velocity widths consistent with those of the optical broad line region ( blr ) , but it is as yet unclear whether the optical and x - ray lines share a common origin .",
    "we search for evidence of these various features in 1h0707 - 495 , and discuss the implications for the nuclear region of this agn .",
    "we used data from four xmm - newton observations of 1h0707 - 495 which took place in early 2008 .",
    "the observation ids , start dates and amounts of rgs1 good time ( after background filtering ) are listed in table  [ obs_details ] . in each case",
    ", the data were processed using sas version 7.1.0 ( xmmsas_20070708_1801 ) , and the event lists were filtered to remove intervals affected by high proton background .",
    "rgs spectra were obtained using rgsproc , and these spectra , from both rgs1 and rgs2 and including first and second spectral orders , were combined using the method of @xcite into a single spectrum representing @xmath0380  ks of exposure time , and rebinned into groups of three ( first - order ) spectral channels .",
    "this combined spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ total_spec ] . either spex version 2.00.11 @xcite or xspec version",
    "12.5.0aj @xcite were used for model generation and spectral fitting , as specified below .",
    "spectral fitting was performed using the c - statistic @xcite , and uncertainties are 1@xmath4 , unless otherwise stated .",
    "._xmm - newton _ observations of 1h0707 - 495 : observation i d ; start date ; rgs1 good exposure time in seconds , with the percentage of total exposure that these represent . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the spectral continuum in these plots and fits is the @xcite relativistic discline model , with the same parameters except that the blackbody temperature and normalisation , and the powerlaw and reflionx normalisations , were re - fitted in xspec to continuum regions of the rgs spectrum to account for the systematic calibration differences between epic and rgs .",
    "the resulting normalisations are respectively @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 in xspec units , and the blackbody temperature is 0.05  kev .",
    "the model was converted to a table model in spex for convenient fitting to rgs data , and its overall normalisation was allowed to vary during the gaussian fits described above in order to obtain the best local fit to each line .",
    "the depth of the z=0 o  i line in the rgs spectrum is consistent with neutral absorption due to our galaxy , in line with the findings of @xcite , so we set the z=0 neutral absorption to the galactic value of 4.31@xmath8  @xmath9 .      we can estimate the ionisation levels and elemental abundances of the broad - line emitting plasma through comparison with model spectra . in the following analysis , we fitted models to the blue and red components separately .",
    "we used the @xcite reflionx model in xspec to generate reflected emission - line spectra over a wide range of ionisation parameters , with the fe / o relative abundance ratio set to 1 .",
    "we chose this model , which is valid for an optically - thick reflector , because of the dynamical evidence of origin in an accretion disc ( see section  [ discussion ] ) .",
    "the resulting spectra were then imported into spex ( again for convenience of fitting to rgs data ) as table models , and convolved with gaussian velocity broadening with @xmath10  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "this value was chosen to match the best - constrained fitted fwhm , to the blue component of o  viii  ly@xmath2 , of @xmath05000  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "these emission line models were then added to the continuum described in section  [ broad_features ] .",
    "the ratio of o  viii to o  vii emission signals the ionisation level of the emitter .",
    "although the o  vii spectral region is ambiguous , it can nevertheless be used to constrain relative flux .",
    "we therefore fitted the models in narrow spectral regions around the wavelengths of o  viii  ly@xmath2 and the o  vii h - like triplet , fitting the two sets of lines for each velocity phase separately .",
    "we found that the blueshifted and redshifted components require different ionisation parameters : @xmath11 and @xmath12 erg  cm  s@xmath1 respectively , where @xmath13 ; @xmath14 is the 1 - 1000  ryd ( 13.6  ev-13.6  kev ) ionizing luminosity , @xmath15 is the gas density and @xmath16 is the distance from the ionizing source @xcite .",
    "this is necessarily a tentative result , since the fluxes of the o  vii lines can not be measured directly . also , the fitted o  viii / o  vii ratio for the red component will be affected by what we assume for the depth of intrinsic neutral absorption , since the o  i edge falls between the expected wavelengths of the two emission lines for this component .",
    "we note , though , that no o  i absorption line is detected at the relevant wavelength in the restframe of 1h0707 - 495 , so our assumption of no intrinsic neutral absorption is reasonable .    having estimated the ionisation parameter of each velocity component",
    ", we can then potentially use the models at the respective ionisation levels to make rough estimates of elemental abundances with respect to solar .",
    "this is only possible for elements with unblended lines , and so we can not reliably estimate fe / o , or indeed n / o since n  vii  ly@xmath2 is blended with the c  vi radiative recombination continuum ( rrc ) at the resolution of our model . only the blue component has detected lines from both oxygen and carbon .",
    "we therefore separately fitted the model normalisation in narrow spectral regions around o  viii  ly@xmath2 and c  vi  ly@xmath2 for this component ; the ratio of these normalisations gives an estimate of the elemental abundance ratio .",
    "we obtain a c / o ratio of @xmath17 relative to solar @xcite .",
    "the rgs spectrum of 1h0707 - 495 contains no evidence of narrow absorption features from a line - of - sight absorbing wind .",
    "this is unsurprising , since there is no intrinsic ionized uv absorber @xcite ; seyferts with a soft x - ray absorbing outflow also show evidence of an ionized wind in the uv @xcite .",
    "2 .   there are broad ( fwhm @xmath05000  km  s@xmath1 ) emission features in the spectrum , which correspond to o  viii  ly@xmath2 , n  vii  ly@xmath2 , c  vi  ly@xmath2 and a blend of fe  xix / fe  xx / ne  ix  he@xmath2 .",
    "the features have both blueshifted and redshifted components , with an average velocity shift of magnitude @xmath07400  km  s@xmath1 . with this line - of - sight velocity , and assuming that the emitting region has the same inclination to our line of sight as the inner accretion disc ( @xmath18=58.5@xmath19 as obtained from fits to epic data ; @xcite ) , we can derive the actual orbital velocity of the emitter , and then use the virial theorem to calculate a distance of @xmath20  cm from the black hole .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath01600 gravitational radii ( r@xmath21 ) , for a black hole mass of @xmath22  m@xmath23 @xcite .",
    "this distance , plus the existence of both blueshifted and redshifted components , show that the lines must originate in the accretion disc .",
    "the double - peaked lines are produced by doppler - shifted emission from material moving towards and away from us on respective sides of the rotating disc . for a disc around a black hole ,",
    "relativistic effects also come into play : the flux of the blue wing of the line is increased by doppler boosting , and gravitational redshift and time dilation move the lines to longer wavelengths , creating asymmetric velocity shifts ( see  e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these effects become less important with increasing distance from the black hole , so that they will not be highly significant for lines originating at @xmath01600  r@xmath21 .",
    "we calculated the expected velocity shifts of the lines using the diskline model in xspec , assuming the lines originate in a region at 1500@xmath241700  r@xmath21 ; these are overplotted on the measured velocity shifts in fig .",
    "[ vel_shifts ] .",
    "some of the variability in velocity shift between lines is likely to be due to line blending within the broad features , especially in the case of n  vii  ly@xmath2 , which is blended with the c  vi rrc .",
    "the emission features in the rgs could be the narrowest parts of the line cores , originating far out in the disc , of the broadband soft x - ray reflection spectrum identified in epic data .",
    "a similar interpretation has been advanced in the past for some fe k@xmath2 emission line components observed in certain seyferts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our findings thus provide independent support for the conclusions of @xcite and @xcite regarding the discline interpretation of the x - ray spectrum .",
    "4 .   the red and blue wings of the emission lines appear to originate in gas at different ionization levels .",
    "if this is a real effect , it implies density variations in the disc , and/or differences in illumination , perhaps as a result of disc warping or a patchy corona .",
    "the blending of lines within the relevant broad emission features prevents us from coming to any conclusions about the fe / o or n / o abundance ratios in the emitter , or making any direct comparison with the @xmath09 times overabundance of iron in the inner disc , as reported by @xcite . in the case of carbon , though , there is some indication of a supersolar abundance of @xmath04@xmath252 with respect to oxygen . 5 .   soft x - ray emission lines with velocity widths of a few thousand km  s@xmath1 have been detected in several seyfert galaxies , including ngc  4051 @xcite , ngc  5548 @xcite , mkn  509 @xcite , mkn  279 @xcite , and mkn  335 @xcite .",
    "they are often interpreted as originating in the blr .",
    "the likelihood that the soft x - ray broad lines in 1h0707 - 495 are produced in the accretion disc may not be relevant to these other sources since none of their broad lines are double - peaked .",
    "on the other hand , the 1h0707 - 495 broad lines may simply originate at a smaller disc radius , due to the small black hole mass in this source .",
    "6 .   what is the wider relevance of soft x - ray line reflection from the outer disc ?",
    "modelling of high - resolution radio observations of the nearby prototypical seyfert 2 ngc  1068 @xcite has shown that the radio emission from the inner 0.4  pc is likely to originate in an x - ray irradiated molecular disc , where gas is being heated and a radio bremsstrahlung - emitting disc wind is being driven off .",
    "their models predict that soft x - ray emission lines should be observable .",
    "this region in ngc  1068 is far larger than that from which the 1h0707 - 495 emission lines originate .",
    "nevertheless , our connection of broad soft x - ray emission lines with the accretion disc makes it tempting to speculate that the seyfert ` x - ray blr ' could be related to the outer disc x - ray emission predicted by @xcite .",
    "we also note that the blueshifted uv c  iv emission ( @xmath26 - 2000  km  s@xmath1 , @xmath275000  km  s@xmath1 ) in 1h0707 - 495 has been interpreted as originating near the base of an accretion disc wind @xcite . the uv lines lack a redshifted component , implying that they are produced further out ( or higher above the disc ) where wind emission dominates disc emission .",
    "the lower blueshift of the uv lines implies that the wind is decelerating with distance , or flowing at a greater inclination to our line of sight .",
    "the xblr would then be the link between the accretion disc and the base of a disc wind , which is perhaps the ultimate source of the optical broad line region itself .",
