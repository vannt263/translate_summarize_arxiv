    "recently , new examples of immersed  surfaces of finite total curvature in the hyperbolic @xmath1-space @xmath2 of curvature @xmath3 have been found ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "one method used to make these new examples is the following : the set of all conformal branched  ( i.e.  constant mean curvature @xmath4 ) immersions in @xmath5 of finite total curvature with hyperbolic gauss map @xmath6 defined on a compact riemann surface @xmath7 corresponds bijectively to the set of conformal pseudometrics of constant curvature @xmath8 with conical singularities on @xmath7 .",
    "( cf .  @xcite . ) by the work of small  @xcite , this correspondence can be explicitly written when the immersion can be lifted to a null curve in @xmath9 .",
    "this gives a method for constructing new examples .",
    "however , to construct non - branched  surfaces is still difficult , because the method above does not give any control over branch points .    in this paper",
    "we use a new method to construct new examples without branch points , which have higher genus , many symmetries , and embedded ends .",
    "more precisely , we prove that for each complete symmetric finite - total - curvature minimal surface in @xmath10 with a non - degenerate period problem , there exists a corresponding one - parameter family of   surfaces in @xmath2 .",
    "we define the terms `` symmetric '' and `` non - degenerate '' later . to prove the existence of these corresponding one - parameter families , we begin by using a small deformation from the original minimal surface in @xmath10 , preserving its ( hyperbolic ) gauss map @xmath6 and hopf differential @xmath11 .",
    "this gives us  surfaces in @xmath5 , for @xmath12 .",
    "finally , we rescale the surfaces into   surfaces in @xmath2 . the method is somewhat similar to that of @xcite , the main difference being that we use the duality on   surfaces to keep the symmetry properties of the initial minimal surfaces .    here",
    ", we briefly outline the construction : let @xmath13 be a conformal minimal immersion defined on a riemann surface @xmath14 .",
    "we set @xmath15 where the dot means the symmetric product .",
    "then @xmath6 is the gauss map of @xmath16 , and @xmath11 is the hopf differential , namely the @xmath17-part of the complexification of the second fundamental form .",
    "the pair @xmath18 is called the weierstrass data of @xmath16 . for the  surfaces in @xmath5",
    ", the weierstrass data can also be defined .",
    "the  surface @xmath19 with the same weierstrass data @xmath20 as @xmath21 is only defined on the universal cover of @xmath22 .",
    "we set @xmath23 in section  [ sec : red ] , we show that the set @xmath24 can be identified with the hyperbolic @xmath1-space @xmath25 .",
    "( we will use two different notations for hyperbolic space .",
    "the notation @xmath26 will be used to represent the ambient space for cmc surfaces , and the notation @xmath25 will be used to represent the parameter space of @xmath27 . )",
    "we show that any two  immersions in @xmath28 are non - congruent , and they are dual surfaces of the  surface @xmath19 .",
    "( as mentioned above , @xmath20 is the weierstrass data of @xmath19 .",
    "the duality exchanges the roles of the hyperbolic gauss map and the secondary gauss map , and at the same time the sign of the hopf differential is reversed . )    then , defining a subset @xmath29 of immersions which are single - valued on @xmath14 : @xmath30 we show that @xmath31 is either empty , or is a connected totally geodesic subspace of dimension @xmath0 , @xmath8 or @xmath1 in @xmath25 .",
    "( the two - dimensional case does not occur . )",
    "when @xmath32 , the unique  immersion in @xmath29 is irreducible in the sense of @xcite . for initial minimal surfaces @xmath16 , which are symmetric , and have non - degenerate period problems , we can construct a one - parameter family of  surfaces @xmath33 with the same symmetry properties as @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , if the initial minimal surface is generated from a fundamental domain by reflections with respect to three non - parallel planes , we can show that @xmath29 consists of only one point , whenever @xmath4 is sufficiently small .",
    "this unique surface coincides with the above @xmath19 . if we consider @xmath5 as the poincar model of radius @xmath34",
    ", then it converges to the initial surface @xmath16 as @xmath35 .",
    "( see remark  [ rem : converge ] . )",
    "the method we have just described can be applied to virtually all of the well - known symmetric minimal surfaces in @xmath10 .",
    "( see section  [ sec : ftc ] . ) when the hyperbolic gauss map @xmath6 and the hopf differential @xmath11 have certain properties , our method is valid even without initial minimal surfaces . in section  [ sec : fence ] , we demonstrate this by constructing hyperbolic correspondences of the catenoid fence and jorge - meeks fences ( cf .",
