    "ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are point - like x - ray sources located outside the nuclei of galaxies , with luminosities @xmath1 .",
    "these apparent luminosities , assuming isotropic emission , are above the eddington limit of a @xmath2 black hole .",
    "if the eddington limit applies to these objects then the most likely explanation is accretion onto intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) of mass @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "alternatively , ulxs may represent a class of super - eddington emitters and probe a regime in which the accretion rate is much higher than that seen in galactic black hole binaries ( gbhbs ; see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the reality is probably more complex than a single answer , with some ulxs being possibly slightly more massive than stellar mass black holes ( @xmath4 ) but still experiencing super - eddington accretion to some degree .",
    "in addition , mild beaming may be present @xcite .",
    "recently , the _ swift _ observatory has been used to follow up some of the most luminous ulxs @xcite and has allowed studies that span a few months to a year with many observations , compared to the previous deeper but sparse _ chandra_/_xmm - newton _ observations .",
    "the results from these observations have shown that their flux varies significantly by factors of 510 on timescales of days to weeks @xcite . in ngc  5408",
    "x-1 , a 115 day orbital period has been suggested @xcite .",
    "somewhat unexpectedly , most of the ulxs monitored with _",
    "swift _ to date ( holmberg  ix  x-1 , ngc  5408  x-1 , and ngc  4395  x-2 ) do not show pronounced spectral changes @xcite .",
    "the exception is the hyperluminous x - ray source ( @xmath5 ; @xcite ) hlx-1 @xcite which shows x - ray variability ( by a factor of @xmath6 ) but associated with spectral variability @xcite .    here",
    ", we report on a set of new _ swift _ observations aimed at studying holmberg  ii  x-1 ( hoii  x-1 hereafter ) .",
    "this source is a luminous ulx ( @xmath7 up to @xmath8 ; e.g. @xcite ) , located in the dwarf galaxy holmberg  ii , at an estimated distance @xmath9 @xcite . in optical wavelengths ,",
    "the ulx is surrounded by the `` foot nebula '' @xcite which is powered by reprocessing of x - rays and has enabled demonstration , using the @xmath10 nebular recombination line , that the true x - ray luminosity is close to that inferred from the x - ray flux assuming isotropic emission , thus excluding strong beaming effects for this source @xcite .",
    "this has been confirmed by an infrared study @xcite , using the [ ] @xmath11 emission line .",
    "this ulx has also been studied extensively in the x - ray band @xcite and has been seen with 0.310 kev luminosities ranging from a few @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "we obtained 68 observations under _ swift _ program 90217 ( pi : kaaret ) and also analyzed 6 observations obtained under program 35475 .",
    "all these observations were carried out using the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) instrument in its photon - counting ( pc ) mode . the first data set is contiguous and spans 131 days from 2009 december to 2010 april and the second one comes from observations executed in 2006 .",
    "we retrieved level 2 event files from all these observations .",
    "thus , we used the default data screening parameters as described in the xrt user s guide . each observation is composed of one or more snapshots .",
    "we analyzed each snapshot separately , rejecting the ones with an exposure time below 100 s. we were left with 124 snapshots .",
    "we extracted source counts from a circular region with a radius of 20 pixels ( @xmath14 , corresponding to 90% of the point - spread function at 1.5 kev ) and background counts from an annulus with an inner radius of 50 pixels ( @xmath15 ) and an outer radius of 120 pixels ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the same regions were chosen to extract the spectra .",
    "the count rates and spectra were corrected for the loss of flux due to bad pixels and bad columns . for this , an exposure map was generated for each snapshot and used to create an auxiliary response file ( arf ) .",
    "the light curves were binned at 1 day averages to increase statistics .",
    "we also calculated a hardness ratio , defined as the ratio between the net count rate in the 1.510 kev band versus the 0.31.5 kev band .",
    "we co - added spectra using three different count rate ranges ( see table [ tab_fp ] ) and keeping the 2006 data separate , using the addspec ftool .",
    "thus , we ended up with four co - added spectra , which we refer to throughout the letter as spectra 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ( table [ tab_fp ] ) where spectrum 2 is the spectrum for the 2006 data .",
    "the arfs were co - added separately using addarf and weighted accordingly to their counts .",
    "response matrix files ( rmfs ) were taken from the calibration database according to the date of the observations .",
    "concretely , we used the rmf ` swxpc0to12s0_20010101v011.rmf ` for the 2006 observations and the rmf ` swxpc0to12s6_20070901v011.rmf ` for the 2009/2010 observations .",
    "grppha was used to bin the spectra with at least 20 counts in each bin .",
    "finally , we fitted the spectra using xspec 12.6.0 @xcite .",
    "the x - ray light curve of hoii  x-1 ( figure [ lc ] ) shows significant variability , with count rates ranging from 0.02 to @xmath17 .",
    "we calculated a periodogram from the 0.310 kev light curve from the 2009/2010 data set , covering 131 days starting at mjd 55166 , using the method of @xcite for periods in the range of 465 days .",
    "we found no significant peaks in the resulting power spectrum .",
    "the hardness / intensity diagram ( hid ) is shown in figure [ hi ] .",
    "the data from the 2009/2010 data set show a slight trend where the hardness ratio increases with the count rate .",
    "this is confirmed by a @xmath18 test when we test for the null hypothesis of constant hardness .",
    "we get an average hardness of @xmath19 and @xmath20 for 54 degrees of freedom ( dof ) , ruling out constant hardness .",
    "a linear fit to the 2009/2010 data shows a good correlation between the hardness ratio and the rate , with a slope of @xmath21 and a corresponding @xmath18 for the fit of 52.2 for 53 dof .",
    "however , the 2006 observations show a clear offset in hardness with a mean value of @xmath22 , at a mean count rate of @xmath23 . at the same count rate ,",
    "the mean hardness ratio is @xmath24 in the 2009/2010 data . clearly , the hardness ratio is not solely a function of the count rate .",
    "we start the analysis of the spectra ( table [ tab_fp ] and figure [ splot ] ) by using the most simple model , i.e. , an absorbed power - law continuum .",
    "we fix the galactic column density to @xmath25 @xcite and allow for intrinsic absorption .",
    "the @xmath18 of the individual fits are statistically acceptable , except for spectrum 1 .",
    "spectra 1 , 3 , and 4 show a consistent extragalactic absorption with a value of @xmath26 and spectrum 2 shows a lower absorption with @xmath27 .",
    "the intrinsic column density is thus in reasonable agreement with previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) except the lower value for spectrum 2 .",
    "using the multicolor disk ( mcd ) blackbody model alone leads to a very bad fit , with a reduced @xmath18 above 2.0 for all individual fits .    adding an mcd component to the power - law model improves the fits significantly in spectra 1 and 4 , with @xmath28 for 2 additional dof .",
    "the inner - disk temperature is consistent within the errors between the different spectra , with a value of @xmath29 , in agreement with results reported by other authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "after we fitted the power - law index separately , we found that spectra 1 and 4 had the same index within the errors ( @xmath30 ) , consistent with the small evolution of the hardness ratio .",
    "spectrum 3 which has fewer counts shows a compatible index but with a larger error ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "considering the relatively small variation in hardness ratio over the 2009/2010 data , which may be due to a changing fraction of flux in the soft thermal component , we decided to tie these three indices together .",
    "the fit statistics are similar with @xmath32 when the photon indices are independent and @xmath33 when not .",
    "we note that the `` bump '' we see in the residuals of the fit ( figure [ splot ] ) between 2 and 5 kev is likely to be a real feature in the spectra ( as seen in a recent _ xmm - newton _ spectrum ; j.j.e kajava et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "this `` bump '' is most apparent in spectrum 1 , where the reduced @xmath18 of the fit is @xmath34 .",
    "more complicated models should be able to model that feature but here we are limited by statistics .",
    "the power - law plus mcd model has been proven to be very effective in the study of black hole x - ray binaries and has been used extensively with the moderate signal - to - noise spectra of ulxs , leading to claims of the presence of imbhs @xcite due to the presence of a soft excess .",
    "but this excess may also arise from the emission of an outflow at a large distance ( spherization radius ) from the central source @xcite .",
    "recently , some authors have shown that more physical models could be applied to high - quality spectra of ulxs . @xcite and",
    "@xcite use a comptonization model that reflects the coronal emission ( and thus replaces the power law ) in addition to a disk model .",
    "@xcite have applied a model based on a ionized disk reflection and power - law continuum .",
    "we attempted to apply one of the comptonization models ( diskpn + comptt , in xspec ) used by @xcite to our spectra but the fits suffer from huge uncertainties in the fitted parameters .",
    "we also summed all the 2009/2010 spectra but were still unable to constrain the model parameters .",
    "it is apparent from the spectra ( figure [ splot ] ) and spectral parameters ( table [ tab_fp ] ) that there are significant changes that are not only a function of the luminosity , as already seen in the hid .",
    "spectra 1 , 3 , and 4 share the same power - law index ( @xmath35 ) and inner - disk temperature ( @xmath36 ) within the errors although there is a factor of @xmath37 difference in luminosity between spectra 1 and 4 .",
    "the data from 2006 ( spectrum 2 ) definitely show a harder power - law index ( @xmath38 ) , but with the same @xmath39 and a luminosity close to spectrum  3 .    l*7cr",

    "if we attempt a comparison with the spectral states of gbhbs , the power - law index of spectra 1 , 3 , and 4 , which are typical of what has been seen during previous observations ( @xmath35 ) would be consistent with some kind of soft state .",
    "the thermal - dominant state as defined by @xcite implies a disk - flux fraction above 75% and a power - density spectrum with no quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) or very weak features .",
    "the timing properties would be consistent here since the x - ray variability of hoii  x-1 is weak on short timescales @xcite , but the fraction of the flux in the disk component is below 50 % ( with the caveat that the errors on the fractions are huge ) .",
    "thus , it appears that in 2009/2010 the ulx would be classified as being in the steep power - law state where the power - law component contributes more than 50% without the presence of qpos .",
    "spectrum 2 shows a power - law index ( @xmath38 ) that would be indicative of the hard state .",
    "the disk component contributes @xmath100 of the total x - ray flux which would be consistent with the fraction seen in gbhb in this state .",
    "however , the temperature is the same , within errors , in all the spectra .",
    "this is unlike the behavior in gbhb , where the disk blackbody usually has a temperature well below that in the soft states @xcite .",
    "the properties of the soft thermal component in the spectra of hoii  x-1 are unlike the behavior expected for a disk blackbody .",
    "thus , interpretation of the spectral states of hoii  x-1 in terms of the canonical states at gbhbs in which the thermal emission arises from an accretion disk is not valid .",
    "this particular ulx was only seen once in such a hard - like state ( and at a similar luminosity than the _ swift _ 2006 data ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) although it has been observed many times .",
    "looking at the hardness ratios , it appears that hoii  x-1 stayed in this state during the three _ swift _ observations executed in 2006 although they were separated by @xmath101 .",
    "since hoii  x-1 has been caught only once before in such a state and the recent coverage of @xmath102 does not show such a hard power - law index , interesting questions are raised such as does this `` transition '' happen rarely and how long does it last .",
    "we note that the evolutionary sequence of @xcite using comptonized models is constructed as a function of luminosity and does not include the behavior seen here .",
    "also , the constancy of the parameters of the disk component , discussed above , would require the corona to vary so as to cancel out the changes in the true disk temperature , which seems unlikely .",
    "it is also worth noting that the few persistent gbhbs behave quite differently compared to the transient ones .",
    "indeed , objects like lmc  x-1 , lmc  x-3 , or cyg  x-1 spend most of their time in either the soft state or the hard state with only a few transitions ( @xcite , and references therein ) . from a strictly spectral hardness point of view",
    ", hoii  x-1 also seems to spend most of its time in a soft state .",
    "other ulxs like holmberg  ix  x-1 seem to be , instead , locked in some kind of hard state @xcite .",
    "we also note that the ulx ngc  1313  x-1 was seen in two different `` states '' at a similar luminosity @xcite , hence showing an analogous behavior to hoii  x-1 .    on the other hand",
    ", the 2009/10 light curve reveals that hoii  x-1 experiences rapid flares that are not tied to spectral changes ( i.e. , the hardness ratio does not vary much ) .",
    "these flares occur on timescales shorter than the spacing between the observations , @xmath103 with a mean amplitude of @xmath104 ( absorbed flux / unabsorbed luminosity amplitudes of @xmath105 ) .",
    "if we consider all the snapshots without any additional binning , there are two cases that are indicative of a consecutive flux rise and decay in less than half a day each . other ulxs",
    "also show large x - ray variability without significant changes in their spectral hardness @xcite .",
    "the irregular flaring activity that we see here seems very similar to that of holmberg  ix  x-1 @xcite and could be also compared to the variability of the gbhb grs 1915 + 105 , which exhibits rapid flares ( on timescales of minutes ) that are associated with specific variability patterns @xcite and interpreted as an instability in the radiation pressure dominated part of the disk @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the ulx hoii  x-1 demonstrates x - ray variability by an average factor of @xmath37 on timescales of days to months . over 4 months in 2009/2010 ,",
    "its spectral properties did not vary much , with only a slight increase of the hardness ratio associated with an increase in the count rate . during that interval ,",
    "its spectrum was soft with a steep power - law component and a soft thermal component , similar to that seen during a number of previous observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "only the fraction of flux in the soft thermal component has been seen to vary as a function of x - ray luminosity .",
    "this quasi - absence of spectral variability over large changes in flux has been observed in other ulxs @xcite .",
    "but if we add the 2006 data , the hid becomes non - monotonic : the hardness ratio is higher and correspondingly the spectrum shows a harder power law , consistent with the hard state , although its luminosity is close to two of the other spectra .",
    "the thermal component appears at a temperature close to that seen in the soft spectra , which argues strongly against interpreting that component as due to disk emission .",
    "thus , while hoii  x-1 appears to exhibit hard versus soft states similar to gbhbs , interpretation of the thermal component in terms of gbhb states is likely invalid .",
    "even though our spectral analysis is limited by the use of simple and somewhat empirical models , there are spectral changes that are clearly not associated with flux changes .",
    "this behavior means that , as with gbhbs @xcite , at least two parameters determine the accretion state of this system and that the accretion rate is not the only variable responsible for spectral state changes .    to understand the physics involved , deeper spectra at different count rates and hardness ratios",
    "are needed . the unprecedented coverage possible with _ swift _ has led to new insights into the behavior of ulxs .",
    "combined use of _ swift _ with larger x - ray telescopes could lead to a better understanding of the evolution of the spectral properties of ulxs .",
