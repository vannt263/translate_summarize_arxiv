    "during the years of its discovery as a tev source the bl lac object mkn  501 showed modest integral fluxes , during 1995 about 1/12 of the crab flux above 300  gev @xcite and during 1996 about 1/3 of the crab flux above 1.5  tev @xcite . in the year 1997",
    "the source went into a state of surprisingly high activity in the x - ray @xcite and tev energy bands @xcite . during more than 6 months the source showed a succession of very strong flares with an average differential flux at 1  tev approximately 3 times higher than the flux of the crab nebula .",
    "the extraordinary high tev emission level as well as the significant improvement of detectors and analysis methods made it possible to study the temporal and spectral tev characteristics of a bl lac object with unprecedented detail .",
    "the measurements with the stereoscopic cherenkov telescope system of hegra revealed that while the tev flux varied by factors of up to 30 , the tev spectrum remained surprisingly stable . with a typical statistical accuracy",
    "( 1  @xmath7 ) of the diurnal spectral indices between 0.1 and 0.3 no spectral variability could be ascertained with a statistical significance exceeding @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , dividing the data into groups according to the flux level at 2  tev did not reveal any evidence for a flux hardness correlation ( statistical accuracy of the 1  tev to 10  tev spectral indices  0.05 ) .",
    "the excellent gamma - ray statistics combined with the 20% energy resolution of the hegra instrument resulted in the first detection of gamma - rays from an extragalactic source well beyond 10  tev , and the first high accuracy measurement of an exponential cutoff in the energy region above 5  tev , well into the exponential regime @xcite . from 500  gev to @xmath120  tev the differential photon spectrum could be approximated by a power - law with an exponential cutoff : @xmath9 with @xmath10 @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "note that the stability of the 1997 tev spectrum has been a matter of debate .",
    "the cat group reported evidence for a flux - hardness correlation in their 1997 mkn  501 data set : the spectrum of the 3 days with maximum @xmath14  gev flux in their data set seemed to be harder than the spectrum during the rest of the 1997 observations on a statistically significant level although they did not report an estimate of the systematic uncertainty on this result @xcite .",
    "the apparent contradiction between the hegra and cat results could be explained by the following 2 facts : ( i ) since the cat flux - hardness correlation stems from the energy range below 1  tev while the hegra constraints on the correlation are strongest at energies above 1  tev , the results could indicate a stronger flux - hardness correlation below 1  tev than above 1  tev @xcite ; ( ii ) since the evidence for the flux - hardness correlation is based on the detection of a harder spectrum for a small number of observation nights ( 3 nights ) it could well be that the flux - hardness relation found for these days does not represent the behavior of the source during the full 1997 flaring phase . while there are no hegra observations for the strongest flare in the cat data sample ( april 16th , 1997 ) , the hegra data of the day with the second highest tev emission in the cat data sample ( april 13th , 1997 ) also indicated a harder than average spectrum : the 1  tev to 5  tev photon index of 1.87@xmath15 deviated by 2.7  @xmath7 from the 1997 mean photon index of 2.25 @xcite",
    ". therefore a harder than average spectrum for at least 2 of the 3 cat nights is consistent with the hegra observations even if the spectrum hardened as much above 1  tev as it did below 1  tev .",
    "note that the hegra observations of several later 1997 flares with comparable and higher flux levels than that of april 13th did not show such a trend of spectral hardening in this paper we present hegra observations of mkn  501 during the years 1998 and 1999 and show how the energy spectrum evolved in the years following the 1997 flaring phase . after describing the telescope system as well as the dataset in sect .",

    "the system consists of five telescopes ( ct2 - ct6 ) which are operated as a single detector for the stereoscopic detection of air showers induced by primary gamma - rays in the atmosphere .",
    "the telescope system has been taking data since 1996 , initially with three and later four telescopes , and since fall 1998 as a complete five - telescope system . with an energy threshold of 500 gev",
    ", the telescope system achieves an angular resolution of 0.1@xmath16 and an energy resolution of 20% for individual photons , as well as an approximate energy flux sensitivity @xmath17f@xmath18 at 1 tev of 10@xmath19 @xmath20 ( s / n = 5  @xmath7 ) for 1 hour of observation time .",

    "the mkn  501 flux was clearly below the sensitivity threshold for diurnal observations and an event deficit rather than an event excess was found in the signal region .",

    "the systematic error @xmath39 on the change in spectral index from year to year is smaller than the error on the shape of individual spectra since several contributions to the systematic error affect all measured spectra in the same way ; we estimate that @xmath39  0.05 , i.e.   it is smaller than the statistical error on @xmath40 of 0.1 .",

    "the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) mechanism is widely believed to be responsible for the non - thermal x - ray and tev gamma - ray emission in bl lac objects @xcite",
    ". a high energy population of electrons embedded in a relativistic jet approaching the observer with a speed close to the speed of light emits x - rays as synchrotron radiation and tev gamma - rays as inverse compton radiation resulting from interactions of electrons with lower energy synchrotron photons .",
    "the recent observations of x - ray and tev gamma - ray flares correlated to within less than half a day for mkn  501 @xcite as well as for the other well studied tev emitting bl lac object , mkn  421 @xcite , are naturally explained in the ssc scenario and strongly support this model .",
    "more detailed theoretical work is needed to decide whether the multiwavelength data could reasonably be described with alternative models assuming that the non - thermal emission of mkn  501 is produced by hadronic interactions of a highly relativistic outflow which sweeps up ambient matter @xcite , by interactions of high energy protons with gas clouds moving across the jet @xcite , or by interactions of extremely high energy protons with ambient photons @xcite , with the magnetic field @xcite , or with both @xcite .",
    "note that in the proton synchrotron model the stable spectral shape is explained by the self - regulated synchrotron cutoff , while steepening in the low - flux state could be explained by the drop of the acceleration rate of protons @xcite . while the interpretation of tev gamma - ray spectra is hampered by the unknown modification of the spectrum due to intergalactic extinction as discussed , e.g.  by aharonian et al .",
    "( 1999b ) , the temporal evolution of the gamma - ray flux and the spectral shape is free of this uncertainty and should be explained by models of the origin of the tev radiation .",
    "assuming for the time being that the mechanism responsible for the x - ray and tev gamma - ray emission has been identified , a next step concerns the understanding of how the emission region(s ) is ( are ) embedded in the jet , how an emission region evolves with time , and where the energy which is ultimately converted into the observed non - thermal x - ray and gamma - ray radiation comes from . within ssc models the stability of the tev energy spectrum during the 1997 flares can be explained by a spectrum of accelerated electrons ( and possibly positrons ) which is stable throughout the whole flaring phase @xcite .",
    "the steepening of the tev energy spectrum reported in this paper can be accounted for , by e.g. , ( i )  a steepening of the spectrum of accelerated particles streaming into the emission region ; ( ii )  the shift of the break in the electron spectrum ( caused by the synchrotron and inverse compton cooling of the electrons , or by a lower energy cutoff of the spectrum of accelerated particles ) towards lower energies ; or , by ( iii )  a shift of the maximum energy of accelerated particles towards lower energies .",
