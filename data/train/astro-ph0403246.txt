    "there is an average milky way extinction relation , depending on only one parameter , the ratio of total - to - selective extinction , r@xmath2 , which is applicable to a wide range of interstellar dust environments ( cardelli , clayton , & mathis 1989 ( ccm ) ) .",
    "similarly , there is an interstellar polarization relation , correlated with a single parameter , @xmath0 , the wavelength at which the interstellar polarization is a maximum ( serkowski , mathewson , & ford 1975 ; clayton et al .",
    "1995 ; martin , clayton , & wolff 1999 ) . the parameters , r@xmath2 and @xmath0 , both involve integrals over the size distribution of interstellar dust grains and are well correlated with each other ( serkowski et al .",
    "1975 ; whittet & van breda 1978 ; clayton & mathis 1988 ) .",
    "the existence of these relations , valid over a large wavelength interval , suggests that the environmental processes that modify the grains are efficient and affect all grains .",
    "however , the ccm relation is not a universal law",
    ". it does not fit the observed extinction in the sightlines observed in the magellanic clouds ( e.g. , clayton et al .",
    "1996 ; gordon & clayton 1998 ; misselt , clayton , & gordon 1999 ; gordon et al .",
    "the differences in observed extinction properties seen among the local group galaxies may be due to various environmental factors including metallicity .",
    "the metallicity of the lmc and smc is lower than the galaxy .",
    "therefore , the nature of the dust in m31 is of great interest because its metallicity is similar to that in the milky way .",
    "the nature of interstellar dust in m31 is summarized in lequeux ( 2000 ) .",
    "the uv extinction data for m31 , which are based on only a few lightly reddened sightlines , show a ccm - like far - uv extinction and a weak 2175 a bump ( bianchi et al .",
    "several studies have suggested that the extinction in m31 in the u - band differs from the galaxy ( searle 1983 ; iye & richter 1985 ; massey et al . 1995 ) .",
    "it has also been suggested that there is a systematic change in the u - band extinction with distance from the center of m31 ( iye & richter 1985 ; freedman & madore 1990 ) .",
    "various extimates of r@xmath2 ranging from 2.5 to 3.8 have been made using individual stars and clusters in m31 ( kron & mayall 1960 ; sharov & lyutyj 1989 ; nedialkov & veltchev 1999 ) .",
    "recently , barmby et al . ( 2000 ) find that the u- to k - band extinction curve in m31 , derived from a large number of globular clusters , is consistent with ccm with r@xmath2=3.1 .    the interstellar polarization in the lmc and smc shows a similar wavelength dependence to that seen in the milky way and can be well fit by the serkowski relation ( clayton , martin , & thompson 1983 ; clayton et al .",
    "1996 ; rodrigues et al .",
    "some interstellar polarization measurements in m31 have been made using globular clusters as point sources ( hiltner 1958 ; martin & shawl 1979 , 1982 ) .",
    "however , the wavelength dependence of interstellar polarization has been measured along only one line of sight ( martin & shawl 1979 ) .",
    "this polarization measurement is consistent with the serkowski relationship and a small value of @xmath0 .",
    "we report further observations of the wavelength dependence of interstellar polarization in m31 .",
    "optical spectropolarimetry was obtained using the 6.5 m telescope of the multiple mirror telescope ( mmt ) observatory located on mount hopkins , arizona .",
    "observations were made of four globular clusters listed in table 1 on 2003 october 30 ut .",
    "all of the observations made use of the ccd spectropolarimeter ( schmidt , stockman , & smith 1992 ) , upgraded with a 1200 x 800 pixel , thinned , antireflection - coated , uv - sensitized ccd , and an improved camera lens and half - wave plate .",
    "all observations utilized a 600 line mm@xmath3 grating for high throughput and wide spectral coverage , 4100 - 8300  .",
    "the fwhm resolution with this grating and a slit width of 1  is @xmath417   ( 3 pixels ) .",
    "a polarimetric measurement sequence involves four separate exposures that sample 16 orientations of the semiachromatic half - wave plate and totalled 480 - 1440 s of integration for each of the four clusters through light cloud cover .",
    "polarization position angles were referenced to the equatorial system using interstellar polarization standards ( schmidt , elston & lupie 1992 ) . the spectral flux distribution is also obtained in the course of the observations and is calibrated relative to spectrophotometric standard stars selected from the iraf database ( massey et al . 1988 ) .",
    "the data have been binned and are plotted in figure 1 along with the spectra of the globular clusters .",
    "in addition , spectropolarimetric observations of s78 were obtained with the hpol spectropolarimeter on the 3.5 m wisconsin - indiana - yale - noao ( wiyn ) telescope on kitt peak .",
    "the spectropolarimeter is a modified boller & chivens spectrograph with a rotating superachromatic waveplate after the slit ( nordsieck & harris 1996 ; wolff , nordsieck , & nook 1996 ) .",
    "spectra are obtained at eight waveplate angles on a reticon 400 x 1200 ccd .",
    "two gratings are used , producing spectra and 3 pixel resolutions of 3200 - 6200   ( 9  ) and 6000 - 10500    ( 12  ) , respectively .",
    "two polarized star spectra and two polarized sky spectra are obtained simultaneously .",
    "the calibration accuracy in polarization is @xmath5p/500 and in position angle is @xmath51 .",
    "there is an uncertainty of 0.1% in the correction for instrumental polarization .",
    "this small uncertainty does not affect the results presented here .",
    "the wiyn spectropolarimetric data were obtained in 1996 december and 1998 october .",
    "the four nights of data on s78 have been combined and binned to increase the signal - to - noise .",
    "they are plotted in figure 1 .",
    "the polarization measured toward m31 must be corrected for a foreground component .",
    "these lines of sight pass through the disk and halo of the galaxy , and then the halo and disk of m31 . however , since m31 lies at a galactic latitude of -22 , the foreground extinction due to dust in the galaxy is small .",
    "several estimates have been made of the reddening foreground to m31 .",
    "they all indicate that e(b - v ) @xmath4 0.08 - 0.11 ( bianchi et al .",
    "1996 and references therein ) . using the well - known galactic relationship between reddening and interstellar polarization ,",
    "the maximum foreground polarization is @xmath4 0.9% ( serkowski et al .",
    "martin & shawl ( 1979 ) estimated the actual foreground polarization by measuring a sample of galactic stars lying in the direction of m31 as well as the nucleus of m31 itself .",
    "the foreground dust is patchy so there is no way to know a priori what the foreground component is along any given sightline .",
    "so , martin & shawl ( 1982 ) adopted a best - guess value of p@xmath6=0.4% , @xmath0= 5500   with a position angle of 90  by averaging several foreground sightlines .",
    "the new observations reported here have been corrected for foreground polarization in the same manner as martin & shawl ( 1982 ) . a galactic serkowski curve , as described above , was assumed and the foreground polarization at each wavelength was calculated and subtracted .",
    "the foreground - corrected polarizations are plotted in figure 1 .",
    "the observed and foreground corrected values are listed in tables 2 - 6 .",
    "the new data are consistent with the martin & shawl ( 1982 ) data for s78 in the overlapping wavelength range .",
    "similarly , the three wavelength bins for s150 and one bin for s233 , agree with our new data within 2@xmath7 .",
    "there is only one filterless observation of baade 327 having low s / n .",
    "the martin & shawl filter data are plotted for comparison in figure 1 .",
    "the interstellar polarization due to dust in m31 was first measured by hiltner ( 1958 ) using globular clusters as point sources .",
    "he made unfiltered observations of about 20 clusters finding several with significant amounts of polarization .",
    "filter polarimetry of a similar number of clusters was obtained by martin & shawl ( 1979,1982 ) .",
    "only one sightline in their sample , toward s78 , had enough wavelength coverage for a serkowski fit to be made .",
    "that sightline showed p@xmath6 = 1.98@xmath50.07 % , and @xmath0 = 3500@xmath5300 using the wilking et al .",
    "( 1980 ) formulation of the serkowski relation .",
    "our new data for s78 and three additional clusters cover approximately the same wavelength range ( 4100 - 8300  ) as martin & shawl but with many more data bins and smaller uncertainties .",
    "we performed nonlinear least - squares fits to the foreground corrected data for all four clusters using the serkowski law ( serkowski et al .",
    "1975 ; wilking et al . 1980 ; wilking , lebofsky , & rieke 1982 ; whittet et al . 1992 ) .",
    "we found that the k= 1.66@xmath1 relationship , that holds for galactic interstellar polarization , does not produce good fits for the m31 sightlines ( whittet et al .",
    ". however , the serkowski law with k as a free parameter does produce good fits for all of the sightlines .",
    "the three fit parameters are listed in table 1 .",
    "the relationship between k and @xmath0 is shown in figure 2 .",
    "although , we do not have enough sightlines to define the k-@xmath0 relationship for m31 , figure 2 shows that the slope may be steeper than in the galaxy .    the k-@xmath0 relationship for the m31 globulars",
    "is very interesting in that it produces distinctly narrower `` serkowski curves '' than those of the same @xmath0  in the galaxy . as has been shown many times in the past ( wolff et al .",
    "1994 ; clayton et al . 1995 ; martin et al .",
    "1999 ) , grain models have generally been able to reproduce observed galactic interstellar polarization curves by small changes to the size distribution of aligned grains , alignment efficiency , upper integration limit , etc .",
    "this is definitely not the case for the m31 curves in that similar changes to a distribution of astronomical silicates failed to produce k values of the observed amplitude .",
    "even more extreme modifications to the size distribution of silicate particles ( use of `` flat '' distributions , very narrow size ranges , etc . ) tended to produce k values that still remained 30 - 40% too low , at best . as a result",
    ", it would appear that there is something intrinsically different ( and interesting ) about the grains producing the observed polarization in m31 from those in our galaxy .",
    "we intend to investigate this behavior in much greater depth after our sample of m31 globulars has been increased .",
    "previously , only s78 had enough wavelength coverage for a serkowski fit .",
    "our new data , which have better wavelenth coverage and better s / n , show that @xmath1@xmath44775   for s78 , very different from that found by martin & shawl ( 1982 ) .",
    "their value of 3500   is at the extreme low end of @xmath0 values measured in the galaxy ( e.g. , serkowski et al .",
    "the unusual sightline toward hd 210121 , which has one of the lowest r@xmath2 values ever measured , has @xmath83800   ( larson , whittet , & hough 1996 ) .",
    "none of the @xmath420 sightlines measured in the lmc show @xmath0 values below 4900   ( clayton et al . 1983 ) .",
    "only a few sightlines have been observed in the smc and the signal - to - noise is relatively low but @xmath0 lies in the normal galactic range ( rodrigues et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the fits for the four sightlines in m31 reveal values of @xmath0 ranging from 4800 to 5500  .",
    "these are very average values of @xmath0 as measured in the galaxy and the magellanic clouds .",
    "it has been found that r@xmath9 5.5@xmath0 ( serkowski et al .",
    "1975 , whittet & van breda 1978 ; clayton & mathis 1988 ) .",
    "the range of @xmath0 measured in m31 corresponds to r@xmath2 values of 2.7 to 3.1 .",
    "the range in r@xmath2 seen in the galaxy is 2.5 to 5.5 .",
    "so , at least for this very small sample , m31 does not show evidence for sightlines with greater than average grain size , if the nature of the grains is the same as for the galaxy .",
    "this result is in contrast to the paucity of small grains inferred from iras colors ( xu & helou 1994 ) .",
    "the polarizing efficiency of the m31 dust grains can be estimated using the ratio of peak linear polarization to color excess , p@xmath6/e(b - v ) . while the quantity is often equated with the degree of grain alignment efficiency ,",
    "it is also a function of the grain s non - spherical nature as well as the angle between the alignment axis and the line of sight .",
    "however , for brevity , we simply refer to the value as the `` efficiency ratio . ''",
    "the maximum value of this ratio found in the galaxy is 9% mag@xmath3 ( serkowski et al .",
    "1975 ; clayton & cardelli 1988 ) .",
    "we corrected the estimated reddenings for a galactic foreground of e(b - v)=0.1 mag ( barmby et al .",
    "the values of p@xmath6/e(b - v ) for our sample are given in table 1 .",
    "they range from 7.1 to 15.3% mag@xmath3 .",
    "these values generally support the results of martin & shawl ( 1982 ) and imply a similar polarization efficiency in m31 and the galaxy .",
    "the values of p@xmath6/e(b - v ) for our sample are all near the maximum value but some bias is expected since sightlines known to have significant interstellar polarization were selected for inclusion in this sample .",
    "the polarization efficiency toward s233 seems very high , but the amount of reddening is fairly small and the uncertainty is a considerable fraction of the e(b - v ) value itself .",
    "baade 327 is of interest as it is both the most luminous globular cluster known and also the most reddened globular cluster in m31 ( barmby , perrett , & bridges 2002 ) .",
    "van den bergh ( 1968 ) suggested that it is strange that the brightest globular cluster in m31 would also be the most reddened .",
    "this coincidence led to speculation that perhaps the value of r@xmath2 might be small along this sightline resulting in less total extinction , a@xmath2 .",
    "our result for baade 327 , @xmath8 5450  implies that the dust along this sightline has the galactic average , r@xmath93.1 . even if r@xmath2 = 2.5 , as suggested by kron & mayall ( 1960 ) , baade 327 only drops to the second most luminous globular cluster ( barmby et al .",
    "they also point out that the most reddened globular clusters lie close to the center of m31 and those close to the center of m31 seem to be brighter .",
    "the polarization efficiency toward baade 327 is tantalizingly high , particularly given its large color excess and its anticipated favorable viewing geometry ( i.e. , the angle between alignment and line of sight ) ( martin & shawl 1979 , 1982 ) .",
    "clearly , additional observations of m31 globular clusters would provide further insight into the dust environment in that galaxy .",
    "we thank pauline barmby for providing us with reddening estimates for the globular clusters .",
    "we also thank xiaohui fan and gary schmidt for the use of the ccd spectropolarimeter at the mmt during periods when weather conditions were unsuitable for the primary science program .",

    "<S> the wavelength dependence of interstellar polarization due to dust in m31 has been observed along four sightlines . </S>",

    "<S> the fits for the four sightlines reveal values of @xmath1 ranging from 4800 to 5500  . </S>",
    "<S> these are consistent with average values of @xmath0 measured in the galaxy and the magellanic clouds . </S>",
    "<S> the range measured for m31 corresponds to r@xmath2 values of 2.7 to 3.1 . </S>",
    "<S> the range in r@xmath2 seen in the galaxy is 2.5 to 5.5 implying , for this small sample , that the average size of interstellar grains in m31 is typically smaller than that seen for galactic grains if the nature of the grains is the same . </S>",
    "<S> also , the polarization efficiency for these sightlines is large although some bias is expected since sightlines known to have significant interstellar polarization were selected for the sample . </S>"
