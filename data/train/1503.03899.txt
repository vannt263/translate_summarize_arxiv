    "the discovery of a @xmath0-ray transient coincident with the 2010 nova event in v407 cyg was a source of much excitement and surprise for the nova and @xmath0-ray communities alike @xcite . although mev @xmath0-rays produced by nuclear decay in nova ejecta have been predicted for many years ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , gev emission from novae , as detected with _",

    "2010 ) suggested that a blast wave driven into the wind from the mira giant companion accelerated particles to relativistic speeds and produced @xmath0-rays through either leptonic or hadronic secondary interaction . in follow - up work exploring the x - ray properties of v407 cyg , @xcite also claimed that the presence of a red giant companion was the primary characteristic of the system responsible for generating such a @xmath0-ray event and efficient acceleration of particles .",
    "they predicted that @xmath0-ray emission from novae would be very rare , as most systems have main sequence ( ms ) donors ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it did not take long for nature to prove this prediction incorrect . in 2012 ,",
    "the _ fermi_-lat detected two new transients that were spatially coincident with novae .",
    "the association of fermi j1750 - 3243 with the nova v1324 sco was made within a few weeks of the outburst @xcite .",
    "however , the nature of @xmath0-ray transient fgl j0639 + 0548 remained a mystery for several months after discovery @xcite , because its proximity to the sun prevented follow - up by optical observers .",
    "when the region became optically observable a few months after @xmath0-ray detection , a nova was discovered at the location of the _ fermi _ transient @xcite .",
    "thus v959 mon was the first nova _ discovered _ in the @xmath0-rays . in 2013 , the two naked - eye visible novae v339 del and v1369 cen joined the collection of novae detected in @xmath0-rays ( hays et al .",

    "furthermore , no spectral signatures of an evolved companion ( e.g. molecular bands of tio and vo ) were observed in the spectra obtained during outburst .",
    "x - ray observations ( e.g. , orio & pa 2012 , osborne et al . 2013 ) indicated the companion star was partially eclipsing and had an orbital period of 7.1 hours .",
    "the 7.1 hour periodicity was also observed at optical wavelengths ( e.g. , wagner et al .",

    "in fact , other than the @xmath0-ray detections themselves , no property of v1324 sco , v339 del , v1369 cen , or v959 mon is particularly unusual compared to other novae , although v339 del and v1369 cen were quite bright in the optical . a large number of other novae have been optically discovered since the launch of _ fermi _ , yet none of these have been detected as a @xmath0-ray source @xcite . an obvious question",
    "therefore arises_why did v959 mon , v1324 sco , and v339 del produce bright @xmath0-ray emission while others did not ? _",
    "one possibility , as suggested by @xcite , is that v959 mon and other @xmath0-ray - detected novae are unusually nearby compared with the general population of novae .",
    "accurate distances to novae are notoriously difficult to determine . the velocity of absorption systems in the interstellar medium can be measured from low - excitation lines like the  d doublet , and can be used to place limits on the distance to the nova ; however , this method has yet to be extensively tested and relies on knowledge of gas motions in the galaxy . in the case of",

    "the velocity is typically derived from measurements of the width of optical emission lines ( e.g. , slavin et al .",

    "the calibrated data were split into their two basebands , thereby providing two frequency points per receiver band .",

    "the nova had become so dim that only phase self - calibration was possible .    during the 2012 - 2013 campaign , v959 mon",

    "our results are presented in table  [ obs ] .",
    "the 2014 observations were too complex to be fit by a single component .",
    "single 2-d gaussian fits provide simple , first - order estimates of the changing dimensions of v959 mon , although the source is not perfectly described with this profile form . to better model a bipolar structure , we used difmap to model the source in the _ ( u , v ) _ plane using two elliptical gaussian components . modelling the source in the _ ( u , v ) _",
    "plane is often preferable to modelling in the image plane because the _",
    "( u , v ) _ data are not convolved with the restoring beam and are not influenced by the choice of weighting ( robust , natural , uniform , etc . ) for producing an image .",
    "these two - component models produced better ( lower reduced chi - square and smaller rms in the image ) fits to the data than single - component models in all of the first five epochs .",
    "the difmap modelfit procedure consistently placed the two components at either side of the nova in the east - west direction .",
    "this gives us two points per observation to with which to measure the north - south extent of the nova ejecta ( see figure [ difmap_mod ] ) .",
    "for the remainder of the paper , we refer to these two - component 2-d gaussian models as the `` difmap models '' .",
    "the 2014 a - configuration campaign revealed stark changes in the morphology of the nova ejecta .",
    "the nova went from being brightest along the east - west axis to being brightest along the north - south axis ( see figure [ aconfig2 ] ) .",
    "also , the source had become so diffuse that it was resolved out at ka - band ( 28.2 and 36.5 ghz ) . applying a taper to the ka - band data produced images similar to those at ku - band ( 13.5 and 17.4 ghz ) .",
    "while the ka - band observations were resolved out , the c - band ( 7.4 ghz ) images were finally nicely resolved .",
    "various studies found evidence for a bipolar morphology in v959 mon ( e.g. , obrien et al . 2012 , shore et al . 2013 ) .",
    "ribeiro et al . ( 2013 ) applied shape ( version 5 ; steffen et al .",
    "2011 ) to replicate the [ ] emission lines from v959 mon in order to determine the morphology and system parameters . at optical wavelengths ,",
    "the shape models were applied assuming an optically thin morphology , appropriate for the [ ] emission lines .",
    "they determined a maximum ejecta velocity of @xmath110 km s@xmath111 , an inclination angle of @xmath112 and a `` squeeze '' ( 1 minus the ratio of the minimum extent to maximum extent ) of 0.8 .",
    "in other words , the largest extent of the nova ejecta is 5 times the size of the minimum extent . also from ribeiro et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , the maximum extent along the north - south axis was assumed to be one - half the extent along the east - west axis .",
    "shore et al .",
    "( 2013 ) predicted a similar morphology based on their spectroscopic modelling .",
    "for this paper , we created models of the radio emission in shape using the values determined from ribeiro et al .",
    "( 2013 ) as input .",
    "the key difference between the optical shape and radio shape models is that in the latter case we have now incorporated emission and absorption coefficients for the free - free thermal process .",
    "we calculate the radiative transfer on a 3-d grid incorporating the structure via ray tracing to the observer .",
    "the emission and absorption coefficients are dependent on several parameters such as the ejecta density and temperature , as well as the observing frequency .",
    "synthetic radio images were generated assuming an emissivity proportional to the density squared .",
    "the density was taken to vary as @xmath113 and the shell was assumed to maintain a constant fractional thickness with the inner radius 0.25@xmath114 the outer radius .",
    "the velocity structure is taken as a `` hubble flow '' , where velocity increases linearly with radius , reaching a maximum of 2400 km s@xmath111 .",
    "the temperature of the ejecta was assumed constant at @xmath115k , the brightness temperature determined from the first vla ku - band a - configuration imaging using the standard technique .",
    "this was the earliest resolved image of the nova ejecta , and we assume it was still optically thick at this time and frequency .",
    "the ejecta was modelled on days 126 , 157 , and 199 after explosion , and at frequencies of 13.6 and 36.5 ghz .",
    "models were created with ejecta masses of @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 .",
    "models with higher ejecta masses remained optically thick for longer .",
    "the ejecta was assumed to have a filling factor of 1 .",
    "the models initially assumed a distance of 1 kpc to match the minimum expected distance from munari et al .",
    "later , the models were adapted in both pixel scale and flux density to correspond to a distance of 2 kpc , the maximum expected distance from munari et al .",
    "see figure  [ shape_mods ] for examples of the shape models .",
    "it must be noted that the optical spectroscopic observations used to determine the morphology in @xcite were made on 2012 october 29 , 133 ( mjd ) , but subsequent inspection of the _ fermi _ data led to the initial detection date being moved to 3 days earlier on @xmath121 ( mjd ) . ]",
    "days after _ fermi _ detection .",
    "this is close to our first high - resolution vla observation on 2012 october 23 , but not simultaneous .",
    "the maximum ejecta velocity was determined from 8 optical spectroscopic observations between day 63 and day 193 , again not exactly simultaneous with vla observations but close . in principle",
    ", the morphology of the ejecta should be set once the material has cleared the orbit of the secondary star , and it should expand at a roughly constant rate from that point . there is no strong evidence for a deceleration in the [ ] spectra , especially after day 133 ( ribeiro et al .",
    "however , there is the possibility that the ejecta underwent some deceleration which we have not taken into account .",
    "furthermore , the [ ] observed in the optical is not necessarily the material emitting at radio wavelengths and traces a relatively low density outer region of the ejecta ( ribeiro et al .",
    "2013 ) . therefore ,",
    "careful comparisons between the radio shape models built here and the radio observations are necessary to ensure that the two agree reasonably well .",
    "to compare the radio shape models with observations , the models were convolved with the vla restoring beam for the appropriate day and frequency .",
    "next , the models were scaled such that the peak flux density value in the model image matched the peak in the observed image .",
    "this removes the effect of distance from the model images flux densities and allows for the direct comparison of structure between models and observations .",
    "residual images were created by subtracting the scaled models from the observed images .",
    "figures [ res1kpc ] and [ res2kpc ] show the residual maps with the radio shape models at a distance of 1 kpc and 2 kpc , respectively .",
    "the flux scale is the same for all residual images at a given frequency .",
    "these images from the first a - configuration campaign represent a time when the nova ejecta were still largely optically thick .            from the residuals",
    ", it is apparent that the radio shape models do a fair job of matching the observations at 13.5 ghz , but they do not match very well at 36.5 ghz .",
    "the high frequency models become optically thin faster than the observations , especially in the east - west direction .",
    "this is an indication that the ejecta are not perfectly smooth , but have some clumping .",
    "shore et al .",
    "( 2013 ) indicated that a filling factor ( @xmath122 ) of 0.1 was appropriate for this nova .",
    "such a filling factor would allow the high frequency diffuse ejecta to remain optically think longer and better match the observations due to the fact that optical depth scales as @xmath123 ( e.g. , heywood 2004 , and nelson et al . 2014 ) .",
    "also , note from figure [ res2kpc ] that all models with a distance of 2 kpc , except for the highest mass 13.5 ghz model for day 126 , appear to be smaller than the observed images .",
    "we therefore conclude that the true distance to the nova is likely less than 2 kpc .",

    "from the optical shape models from @xcite , the squeeze of 0.8 puts a lower limit on the expansion velocity of @xmath140 the maximum velocity .",

    "however , this is simply due to the fact that the edges of the ejecta become optically thin and the emitting surface recedes as it expands . on the other hand , the fitted angular expansion rates for the north - south axis indicate that the expansion in the north - south direction did not begin until @xmath146 days after detection ( see table  [ tabrate ] ) .",
    "because the ejecta remains optically thick at the north - south edges , this delay may be real .",
    "it is also possible that acceleration is important during early times .",
    "however , given what is known about v959 mon from chomiuk et al .",
    "( 2014b ) , it is also possible that this apparent stall is the time period when the binary is transferring energy to the nova envelope in a common - envelope - like event , culminating in the envelope gaining sufficient kinetic energy to escape the system ( e.g. , livio et al 1990 ; lloyd et al .",
    "1997 ; porter et al .",
    "the recurrent nova t pyx showed similar behavior during its outburst in 2011 in both radio @xcite and x - rays @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to note that analysis of the x - ray light - curve of v959 mon indicates the @xmath147 for the @xmath148 decline occurs around 30 days after detection ( nelson et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "because the @xmath0-rays from v959 mon were detected during the first 21.5 days of the nova evolution @xcite , it seems likely that complex shock structures formed during this early interaction period .",
    "chomiuk et al . ( 2014b ) explain the evolution of nova v959 mon as relating to two ejecta components .",
    "the first component was denser , slower , and confined to the orbital plane of the binary system ( the north - south direction ) .",
    "the second component was a faster moving , less dense flow which was `` funnelled '' by the denser material and constrained to expand in the polar direction ( east - west ) . in the early stages of evolution ,",
    "the fast polar flow remained optically thick and dominated the observed structure of the ejecta .",
    "this fast polar flow was what we modelled with shape ( in both the optical and radio ) in sections 3 and 4 .",
    "an animation illustrating the evolution of optical depth in the fast component was presented in figure 3 of the online version of ribeiro et al .",
    "( 2014 ) .",
    "the slower component only became obvious when the nova was imaged during the 2014 vla a - configuration campaign .",
    "as shown in figure  [ aconfig2 ] , particularly for the 13.5 ghz and 7.4 ghz images , the ejecta in the orbital plane remains visible and optically thick much longer than the fast material in the polar directions .",
    "because this material is associated with the pinched region at the very center of the ejecta , its velocity must be the minimum derived from the optical shape model .",
    "that is , this material is moving at 480 km s@xmath111 .",
    "therefore , the expansion parallax of these late time bright spots should provide the best estimate of the distance because we know the velocity to reasonably high certainty .",
    "unfortunately , because the material is significantly dimmer at such late times , and because it has become so diffuse , it is harder to image and has more uncertainty in its position .",
    "in fact , as mentioned in section 2 , the ejecta had become so diffuse that it was nearly completely resolved out at 28.2 and 36.5 ghz . also , we only had two epochs per observing frequency during the 2014 a - configuration , so we are not able to reliably determine the expansion rate . still ,",
    "if we make some reasonable assumptions , we can calculate a most likely distance to the nova .",
    "first , we assume that the material has been expanding since the nova was detected by _",
    "fermi_. as mentioned in section 3 , the material may have started expanding about 25 days after expansion , but because these images were taken over 600 days after detection , an uncertainty of 25 days is only about 4% , which is much less than the uncertainty in the north - south angular extent of the ejecta .",
    "second , we assume that the slow components have been expanding with a constant velocity of @xmath149 km s@xmath111 .",
    "the uncertainty in the velocity is twice as large as used in section 4 in order to account for the fact that both the optical and radio shape models did not expressly contain fast and slow components , but they nevertheless produce results similar to the observations ( as demonstrated in section 3 ) .    due to the diffuse nature of the ejecta , we were unable to determine the locations of the components by modelling in the _ ( u , v ) _ plane with difmap",
    ". instead , we used the aips task ` jmfit ` to determine the central location of the north and south components .",
    "once the angular separations between the two components are known , the distance can be calculated using @xmath150 where @xmath143 is the distance in kpc , @xmath144 is the expansion velocity of the ejecta in km s@xmath111 with respect to the center of the nova , @xmath151 is the time from _ fermi _ detection in days , and @xmath152 is the separation between the two components in arcseconds . the separations between the two components and the calculated distances are presented in table  [ tabslow ] .",
    "the mean distance from these calculations is @xmath3 kpc .",
    "this places the nova nicely in the middle of the lower and upper limits found in section 4 .",
    "it also agrees well with distance estimates based on  d absorption ( munari et al .",
    "2013 ) .    as an amusing side note , chomiuk et al .",
    "( 2012 ) used photometric parallax calculations to estimate the distance to v959 mon based the @xmath153 ghz flux density on 2012 september 1 ( day 74 ) , using 2012 june 22 as day 0 , and assuming spherical symmetry , an expansion velocity of @xmath154 km s@xmath111 , and a temperature of @xmath155k .",
    "every single one of these assumptions was incorrect .",
    "the true day 0 was 2012 june 19 , so they assumed the ejecta had been expanding for 71 days instead of 74 .",
    "the ejecta is clearly _ not _ spherical , which also means there is a large range in the expansion velocity . finally , the temperature estimate was off by a factor of approximately @xmath156 . amazingly , despite all of these glaring inaccuracies , they estimated the distance to be @xmath157 kpc .",
    "purely by chance , the assumptions were all wrong in exactly the right way in order to result in the correct distance .",
    "clearly , such simplistic distance estimates should be treated with extreme caution .",

    "work by finzell et al .",
    "( in prep ) also indicates that v1324 sco is likely further away , and thus more luminous , than reported in @xcite .",
    "this makes v959 mon even more of a low - luminosity outlier than it already appears to be .",
    "using expansion parallax techniques and high - resolution radio imaging , we find that the distance to nova v959 mon is between @xmath1 kpc and @xmath2 kpc , with a most probable distance of @xmath3 kpc .",
    "these results agree well with estimates of the distance based on  d absorption @xcite .",

    "comparison of the vla images with the synthetic radio shape images also indicate the nova is closer than 2.0 kpc .    tracking",
    "the expansion of the ejecta in the radio images also indicates that the radio - emitting material may not have begun expanding until roughly 25 days after the nova was discovered by _",
    "fermi_. this apparent `` stall '' time is suspiciously similar to the time when @xmath148 decline occurs in the x - ray observations ( @xmath10730 days ; nelson et al .",
    ", in prep ) , and the total time that v959 mon was detected by _ fermi _ ( 21.5 days ; ackermann et al . 2014 ) . as proposed in @xcite , it is likely that during the first 25 days the nova was in a common - envelope - like phase where complex shock structures formed and led to both synchrotron and @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "interestingly , the infrared interferometric observations of another _ fermi_-detected nova , v339 del , from schaefer et al .",
    "( 2014 ) also shows a sudden increase in expansion rate around 30 days after initial detection .",
    "it is possible that many ( and perhaps all ) novae undergo this common - envelope - like phase during the first month of their evolution .",
    "the morphology of other _ fermi_-detected classical novae ( i.e. , novae without a giant companion ) are still largely unknown ( e.g. , schaefer et al .",
    "2014 ; ackermann et al .",
    "further modelling and observations are needed to investigate if they are mostly bipolar in shape like v959 mon , or perhaps a simpler spherical shape . however , in the case of a spherical shape , it is difficult to explain where the @xmath0-rays would originate without a multi - phase ejection model that produces internal shocks .",
    "also , if the common - envelope - like phase is as ubiquitous as we suspect , nearly all classical novae should have complicated bipolar shapes ( e.g. , lloyd et al . 1997 ; porter et al . 1998 ) .",
    "any apparent spherically - shaped nova may simply be due to the orientation with respect to our line - of - sight .",
    "using our calculated distance to v959 mon of 1.4 kpc , the @xmath0-ray luminosity is approximately @xmath168 erg s@xmath111 .",
    "this is much lower than the other three _ fermi_-detected novae presented in @xcite , indicating that the range of @xmath0-ray luminosities for novae is at least a factor of 10 .",
    "if v959 mon had been at a more typical distance for a nova ( e.g. , between 4 and 8 kpc ) , it probably would not have been detected by _",
    "furthermore , the existence of one such low @xmath0-ray luminosity nova indicates that there are likely many other novae with @xmath0-ray emission that are undetectable simply due to their distance .",
    "in fact , it is possible that all novae emit @xmath0-rays , but we only detect the most luminous and/or nearest of them .    the difference in the @xmath0-ray luminosity between v407 cyg and v959 mon are likely due to the presence of wind from a giant companion in v407 cyg while v959 mon has a main sequence companion with no such wind .",
    "the differences in luminosity between v959 mon and v339 del or v1324 sco require a different explanation .",
    "however , it is well - known that novae have a large range in ejected mass and the ejecta velocities and these factors are likely to be important in determining their @xmath0-ray luminosities .",
    "it should also be noted that the distances to the other _",
    "fermi_-detected novae remain highly uncertain , and we suspect they are even more luminous than reported in @xcite .",
