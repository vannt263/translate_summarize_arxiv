    "the study of gauge - fixed quark and gluon correlation functions on the lattice is a useful tool to understand the non - perturbative behavior of qcd . within lattice",
    "qcd one may hope that the quark - gluon vertex in particular may be a momentum dependent probe that displays discretization effects beyond those seen in the free field case .",
    "indeed one may hope that knowledge of the quark - gluon vertex allows the determination of improvement coefficients without resort to ward identities .",
    "this may allow the non - perturbative @xmath2 improvement obtained in the light quark limit for clover fermions@xcite using the pcac relation to be extended to the fermilab action@xcite at arbitrary quark mass .    beyond lattice",
    "qcd knowledge of the non - perturbative @xmath3-point functions gives the only theoretical access to the deeply infra - red sector of the theory and may be used to provide non - perturbative information for model calculations .",
    "further we can obtain the non - perturbative running of a physically defined coupling , and may be able to use these non - perturbative correlation functions in the dyson - schwinger equations .",
    "dses are of qualitative and quantitative importance in understanding dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and confinement , and simulations of lattice qcd also provide access to qcd s schwinger functions .",
    "previous studies of the quenched theory have yielded gluon@xcite and clover quark@xcite propagators and the quark - gluon vertex on the lattice has also been studied extensively@xcite .",
    "these previous studies of the vertex were limited to the on - shell improved , non - chirally symmetric clover action , and post - simulation field rotations were used to implement off - shell improvement .",
    "the domain wall chiral fermion action@xcite is automatically @xmath2-improved , and domain wall fields should greatly aid studies of off - shell correlation functions . the off - shell quark propagator has been previously and comprehensively studied for the domain wall fermion action@xcite , and renormalization constants were determined for many fermion bilinears in the chiral limit for the wilson and dbw2 gauge actions .",
    "the off - shell properties of the propagator were found to be remarkably continuum - like for this action , and one expects that this would also be seen for the domain wall vertex function .    in this paper",
    "we also use this more advanced domain wall fermion action , which is chirally symmetric ( bar exponentially small terms ) , and demonstrate that such improvement is indeed seen in our calculations of the quark - quark - gluon three - point function and the vertex function .",
    "further , one might expect that a dirac structure decomposition of the vertex function could be used to match the clover action ( with field rotations ) to the domain wall action .",
    "this could provide a mechanism for fixing the clover coefficient non - perturbatively without the imposition of the pcac relation , and it was hoped that this would allow a non - perturbative clover coefficient determination for all quark masses@xcite .",
    "however we find weak dependence on this coefficient after absorbing a trivial mass renormalization and instead find the correlation function is most sensitive to the @xmath1 improvement parameter .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : section  [ secdefinitions ] defines the notation and lattice correlation functions measured to obtain gauge - fixed two - point and three - point functions .",
    "section  [ secparams ] lists details of the simulation parameters .",
    "section  [ secgaugefix ] presents the gauge - fixing strategy used .",
    "sections [ secfermionprop ] and [ secgluonprop ] present simulation results of the quark and gluon two - point functions",
    ". section  [ secvertex ] presents simulation results of the quark - quark - gluon three - point function and the truncated vertex .",
    "section  [ secdiscuss ] discusses the off - shell improvement and contrasts the dwf and clover cases . finally , section  [ secfuture ] presents a summary , conclusions , and future outlook for this program .",
    "the on - shell @xmath2-improved wilson clover action@xcite can be written as @xmath4    to _ off - shell _ improve the physical quantities calculated from this wilson clover action , we keep the action unchanged but perform post - simulation rotations@xcite to improved quark fields of the form @xmath5\\psi\\nonumber\\\\ \\overline{\\psi } \\rightarrow \\hat{\\overline{\\psi } } & = & % \\mathcal z_q^{\\frac { 1}{2 } } \\overline{\\psi } \\left[1+a{c_q}^\\prime ( -\\!\\!\\stackrel{\\leftarrow}{d_c } + m ) - ac_\\mathrm{ngi } \\gamma_{\\mu}\\stackrel{\\leftarrow}{\\partial_{\\mu}}\\right ] .",

    "the gluon propagator ( in landau gauge ) is @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28      the quark - gluon vertex function can be calculated from the following three - point function@xcite : @xmath29 where the lattice gluon field @xmath20 is defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : gluon_field ] .",
    "the fourier - transformed , amputated and transverse - projected vertex function in momentum space for landau gauge is given by @xmath30 where the projected vertex function is introduced since the gluon propagator is singular for general momenta , posing problems for a full amputation .",
    "note that the @xmath31 means @xmath32 for the bare vertex and @xmath33 for the off - shell improved clover quark field .",
    "in the case of @xmath34 the gluon propagator is no longer proportional to the projection @xmath35 , but rather is @xmath36 the non - perturbative gluon propagator in a finite volume remains well defined and the same amputation process is used .",
    "all of the calculations in this paper were performed with the wilson gauge action@xcite in the quenched approximation at @xmath37 , @xmath38 gev with a @xmath39 lattice size@xcite .",
    "the simulation was performed using a heatbath algorithm with @xmath40 thermalization sweeps and @xmath41 measurements , separated by @xmath40 sweeps each .",
    "the fermion actions used are dwf and the wilson clover action with various parameters .",
    "the details are listed in table  [ tab : params ] , and we note that the pseudoscalar masses for three of the clover action combinations were ( somewhat approximately ) matched to the domain wall pseudoscalar mass using a single , low - statistics pass .",

    "we have calculated the form factors @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 for both the bare clover action and the dwf action in two kinematic regions .",
    "we have numerically demonstrated rather clearly the automatic off - shell improvement of chiral fermion formulations .    performing post - simulation rotations on the clover data",
    "can yield improved form factors .",
    "this involves worrisome systematic errors , such as the taking of @xmath47 , which are entirely avoided in the dwf formulation .",
    "we demonstrate here that the use of the vertex function form factors as a means of fixing at least one improvement coefficient of the clover action in a manner that does not require the light quark limit .",
    "unfortunately we have not been able to fix the crucial on - shell coefficient @xmath48 .    from the vertex form factors for the @xmath49 kinematics",
    ", we showed that we can provide an independent way of determining the coefficient @xmath1 appearing in the improved quark field for the non - perturbatively improved clover action .",
    "our finding of @xmath50 is very close to the tree - level prediction@xcite , @xmath51 with the same tree - level @xmath52 , or to the mean - field value of @xmath53 with @xmath54 , and also to previous calculations@xcite from the quark propagator alone .",
    "we note that simulations with different clover coefficients and matched pseudoscalar masses produced identical vertex function form factors .",
    "one would navely expect to see a difference due to different choices of clover coefficient , particularly in the @xmath46 form factor and in the large momentum region where the leading perturbative behavior should dominate and the universal cut - off - insensitive infrared physics disappears .",
    "however , it seems that the we have not yet reached a sufficiently fine lattice spacing where this perturbative intuition applies .",
    "thus this coefficient can not be fixed at these lattice spacings using this approach .",
    "in contrast to the insensitivity to the clover coefficient , we see a large change in off - shell behavior between the entire clover class of actions and the domain wall action . in particular , since the domain wall action is @xmath2 off - shell improved and this ( un - rotated ) clover action is not , large differences serve to demonstrate the effectiveness of the domain wall action , and it surely is a better action to study the vertex function in the future .",
    "we have studied the non - perturbative structure of two- and three - point functions for both the domain wall fermion action with an automatically @xmath2 off - shell improved quark field , and for the on - shell improved clover action with various choices of the @xmath48 coefficient at fixed pseudoscalar mass . for the clover action the vertex function shows weak dependence on various choices of @xmath48 at fixed pseudoscalar mass .",
    "studying various dirac structures at large momentum for the domain wall action showed vast improvements in the off - shell behavior of the theory .",
    "also promising is the use of the behavior of the vertex function as a new method of fixing the @xmath2 off - shell improved field coefficients for other fermion actions , in particular during the non - perturbative step scaling of relativistic heavy quark actions .",
    "comparison with the less - improved clover action allowed us to provide a new method to determine the coefficient @xmath1 through the form factor @xmath44 .",
    "the result found was consistent with the value calculated from the quark propagator and previous published results .",
    "further , this consistency may be taken as additional evidence that @xmath9 is negligible .",
