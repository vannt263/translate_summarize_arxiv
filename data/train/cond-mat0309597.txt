    "understanding some of the peculiar properties of the high temperature superconductors ( htsc s ) is one of the challenging problems in the condensed matter physics .",
    "especially , in the underdoped region , not only the unusually high superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath19 ) but also many normal state properties have defied our current knowledge of metal .",
    "the tremendous experimental results have been accumulated since since the discovery of htsc in 1986 .",
    "unfortunately , due to both the experimental and material constrains , many high quality data were collected on different materials .",
    "for instance , neutron scattering experiments require very large single crystals and therefore have almost exclusively been done on yba@xmath0cu@xmath4o@xmath20 ( y123 ) and la@xmath8sr@xmath9cuo@xmath10 ( ls214 ) that big crystals can be grown .",
    "angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) and scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) , which are sensitive to surface conditions , have been performed mainly on bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath20 that a virgin surface can be obtained by cleavage . on the other hand , resistivity @xmath21 , hall coefficient @xmath22 and thermoelectric power ( tep )",
    "@xmath23 have been measured on almost all htsc s .",
    "it will be most fruitful if different measurements done on different materials can be compared and analyzed on a common ground , say , hole concentration per cuo@xmath0 layer , @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath1 can be determined by sr content @xmath11 ( @xmath1 = @xmath11 ) in la@xmath8sr@xmath9cuo@xmath10 with only cation doping , but it is hard to determine @xmath1 unambiguously in the other systems with anion doping . if @xmath1 can be determined by either one of @xmath21 , @xmath22 or @xmath23 , then almost all the available data can be compared quantitatively and analyzed on a common physical ground .",
    "especially , establishing a scale based on tep is much powerful , since the @xmath23 of htsc is not sensitive to both the grain boundary effect and the porosity effect.@xcite therefore , with some precautions , both single crystal and polycrystalline data can be compared .",
    "the underdoped htsc is characterized by a gap - like anomaly appeared below a characteristic temperature , the so - called pseudogap temperature . the pseudogap behavior was first observed in @xmath24y nmr knight shift @xmath25@xmath26 and in the @xmath27cu spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath27(@xmath28)@xmath29.@xcite it also showed up as an anomaly in the @xmath21 and @xmath22 versus temperature curves.@xcite subsequently",
    ", the pseudogap behavior has been observed in many experimental probes , such as far infrared,@xcite arpes,@xcite tep,@xcite specific heat,@xcite time resolved quasiparticle relaxation ( qpr ) measurement@xcite and so on .",
    "the pseudogap temperature systematically varies with cation or anion doping in individual systems .",
    "however , due to the above reason , these pseudogap temperatures can not be compared based on the hole concentration .",
    "in such a situation , the room temperature tep ( @xmath7 ) was proposed to be useful for determining @xmath1.@xcite according to this scale , the pseudogap behavior is summarized on the phase diagram that the pseudogap temperature falls from higher temperature at lower hole concentration to zero at a critical hole concentration across the @xmath19 curve.@xcite on the other hand , the result of arpes suggests that the pseudogap temperature does not cross the @xmath19 curve , but smoothly merges with @xmath19 on the slightly overdoped side.@xcite    for ls214 system , @xmath19 appears at @xmath1 @xmath30 0.06 , passes a maximum @xmath19 ( @xmath31 ) at @xmath1 @xmath30 0.16 , and finally falls to zero at @xmath1 @xmath30 0.27 .",
    "it was approximated by a parabolic curve@xcite @xmath32 although formula ( 1 ) can be conveniently used to estimate @xmath1 for the systems with similar parabolic variation of @xmath19 , it can not be used for the systems with a complex variation of @xmath19 such as y123 .",
    "@xmath1 of y123 was estimated from the bond valence sum ( bvs ) analysis , which relied on accurate knowledge of interatomic bond lengths.@xcite later , it was shown that , for some htsc s , @xmath7 can be used to estimate @xmath1 consistent with that determined by either formula ( 1 ) or bvs analysis.@xcite the following empirical formula has been proposed.@xcite @xmath33\\!=\\!\\ ! \\left\\ {      \\begin{array}{ll }      \\!\\!372\\exp(-32.4p_{pl } ) & \\mbox{$(0.00\\!<\\!p_{pl}\\!<\\!0.05)$ } \\\\      \\!\\!992\\exp(-38.1p_{pl } ) & \\mbox{$(0.05\\!<\\!p_{pl}\\!<\\!0.155)$ } \\label{form2 } \\\\      \\!\\!24.2 - 139p_{pl } & \\mbox{$(0.155\\!<\\!p_{pl})$ } .",
    "\\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    formula ( 2 ) has been widely used with the distinct advantages that @xmath7 is material independent .",
    "therefore , it can be used to compare physical properties as a function of @xmath1 of very different htsc s .",
    "but , there are still difficulties in using formula ( 2 ) . for instance",
    ", there is no reason why the optimal @xmath1 , where @xmath31 appears , should be universally @xmath34 0.16 for htsc as has already been questioned in ref .  .",
    "it is also not trivial to apply bvs to determine @xmath1 for systems with internal strain due to the cuo chain structure such as y123.@xcite furthermore it is reported that , for ls214,@xcite ( ca@xmath3la@xmath2)(ba@xmath35la@xmath36)cu@xmath4o@xmath20 ( c@xmath3lblc ) , @xcite and bi@xmath0sr@xmath37la@xmath3cuo@xmath20 ( bi2201),@xcite @xmath1 s determined by formula ( 1 ) are not consistent with those determined by formula ( 2 ) .",

    "although it is not clear exactly how this scale works so well , we argued that @xmath7 is dictated by some intrinsic equilibrium properties of the electronic states of doped holes and , therefore , can be used as a common scale to measure @xmath106 of layered htsc cuprates .",

    "<S> we argue that @xmath7(@xmath1 ) represents a measure of the intrinsic equilibrium electronic states of doped holes and , therefore , can be used as a common scale for the carrier concentrations of layered cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> we shows that the @xmath1 determined by this new universal scale is consistent with both hole concentration microscopically determined by nqr and the hole concentration macroscopically determined by the formal valency of cu . </S>",
    "<S> we find two characteristic scaling temperatures , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , in the tep vs. temperature curves that change systematically with doping . </S>",
    "<S> based on the universal scale , we uncover a universal phase diagram in which almost all the experimentally determined pseudogap temperatures as a function of @xmath1 fall on two common curves ; @xmath14r @xmath15 temperature defined by the @xmath16 versus @xmath17 curve and @xmath18 @xmath15 temperature defined by the @xmath13 versus @xmath1 curve . </S>",
    "<S> we find that while pseudogaps are intrinsic properties of doped holes of a single cuo@xmath0 layer for all high-@xmath19 cuprates , @xmath19 depends on the number of layers , therefore the inter - layer coupling , in each individual system . </S>"
