    "time - dependent mixing - induced and direct @xmath0 asymmetries @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , in charmless three - body decays of the @xmath9 mesons have been measured by babar and belle for @xmath4 and @xmath10 final states .",
    "in addition , babar has also measured time - dependent @xmath0 asymmetries for @xmath11 and @xmath5 and performed a dalitz plot analysis for @xmath10 .    for @xmath0 eigenstates ,",
    "the measured mixing - induced @xmath0 asymmetry @xmath7 can be used to define an effective @xmath12 via @xmath13 with @xmath14 being the @xmath0 eigenvalue of the final state @xmath15 . while @xmath4 , @xmath16 and @xmath5 have fixed @xmath0-parities with @xmath17 respectively",
    ", @xmath18 is an admixture of @xmath0-even and @xmath0-odd components , rendering its cp analysis more complicated . by excluding the major @xmath0-odd contribution from @xmath19 ,",
    "the 3-body @xmath18 final state is primarily @xmath0-even .",
    "a measurement of the @xmath0-even fraction @xmath20 in the @xmath3 decay yields @xmath21 by babar @xcite and @xmath22 by belle @xcite , while the cp - odd fraction in @xmath11 is measured to be @xmath23 by babar @xcite .",
    "hence , while @xmath24 for the @xmath4 mode , @xmath25 for @xmath18 and @xmath26 for @xmath11 .",
    "the world average of @xmath12 measured in the decays @xmath27 with @xmath28 being a charmonium is @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "however , the time - dependent _ cp _ asymmetries in the @xmath30 penguin - induced two - body decays such as @xmath31 measured by babar and belle indicate @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "this seems to imply a 2.6 @xmath33 deviation from the expectation of the standard model ( sm ) where @xmath0 asymmetry in all above - mentioned modes should be equal to @xmath34 @xcite with a small deviation _ at most _",
    "@xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the measured results of @xmath36 for @xmath37 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are listed in table iv below . in order to see",
    "if the current measurements of the deviation of @xmath36 in these modes from @xmath34 signal new physics in @xmath38 penguin - induced modes , it is of great importance to examine and estimate how much of the deviation of @xmath36 is allowed in the sm .",
    "one of the major uncertainties in the dynamic calculations lies in the hadronic matrix elements which are nonperturbative in nature .",
    "one way to circumvent this difficulty is to impose su(3 ) flavor symmetry @xcite or isospin and u - spin symmetries @xcite to constrain the relevant hadronic matrix elements . while this approach is model independent in the symmetry limit , deviations from that limit can only be computed in a model dependent fashion .",
    "in addition , it may have some weakness as discussed in @xcite .    as mentioned above",
    ", babar has performed a dalitz plot analysis for @xmath39 decays and found that it is dominated by @xmath40-wave nonresonant contributions with fraction @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "a large nonresonant component is also found in @xmath42 decays @xcite .",
    "this is a surprise because it is known that in three - body decays of @xmath43 mesons , the nonresonant background is at most 10% .",
    "hence , it is very important to take into account the large nonresonant effects in any realistic model calculations .",
    "we consider the decay @xmath44 as an illustration . under the factorization approach ,",
    "its decay amplitude consists of three distinct factorizable terms : ( i ) the meson emission process , @xmath45 , ( ii ) the transition process , @xmath46 , and ( iii ) the annihilation process @xmath47 , where @xmath48 denotes a @xmath49 transition matrix element .    for the kaon emission process",
    ", the amplitude induced by @xmath50 currents reads @xmath51 ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 and @xmath55 are three unknown form factors . in principle",
    ", one can apply heavy meson chiral perturbation theory ( hmchpt ) to evaluate the form factors @xmath54 and @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the relevant diagrams are depicted in fig .",
    "1 . however",
    ", this will lead to too large nonresonant decay rates in disagreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "a direct calculation indicates that the branching ratio of @xmath39 arising from the current - induced process alone is already at the level of @xmath56 which substantially exceeds the measured total branching ratio of @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the issue has to do with the applicability of hmchpt . in order to apply this approach",
    ", two of the final - state pseudoscalars have to be soft .",
    "the momentum of the soft pseudoscalar should be smaller than the chiral symmetry breaking scale of order 1 gev .",
    "for 3-body charmless @xmath9 decays , the available phase space where chiral perturbation theory is applicable is only a small fraction of the whole dalitz plot .",
    "therefore , it is not justified to apply chiral and heavy quark symmetries to a certain kinematic region and then generalize it to the region beyond its validity .    to circumvent the aforementioned difficulty",
    ", we assume the momentum dependence of the nonresonant amplitude in the exponential form @xmath58 so that the hmchpt results are recovered in the soft meson limit @xmath59 .",
    "that is , the nonresonant amplitude in the soft meson region is described by hmchpt , but its energy dependence beyond the chiral limit is governed by the exponential term @xmath60 . the parameter @xmath61 can be constrained by the decay @xmath62 @xcite .      for the kaon emission process , there exist two more amplitudes , one induced by currents and the other induced by scalar densities : @xmath65 although the 3-body matrix elements in @xmath66 and @xmath67 are ozi suppressed , they do receive intermediate vector meson and scalar pole contributions , respectively .",
    "for example , @xmath68 where @xmath69 denote the generic @xmath70-type scalar mesons , @xmath71 .    for the transition amplitudes",
    ", we need to consider the two - body matrix elements @xmath72 and @xmath73 . both receive resonant and nonresonant contributions .",
    "the first matrix element can be related to the kaon electromagnetic ( e.m . )",
    "form factors @xmath74 and @xmath75 for the charged and neutral kaons , respectively .",
    "the nonresonant form factor can be constrained by the asymptotic behavior implied by pqcd @xcite .",
    "the second matrix element has the expression @xmath76 where the scalar decay constant @xmath77 is defined by @xmath78 .",
    "it turns out that the nonresonant background in @xmath79 transition described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : adalitz ] ) it too small to account for the experimental observation that @xmath80 is dominated by the nonresonant contributions .",
    "this implies that the two - body matrix element e.g. @xmath81 induced by the scalar density should have a large nonresonant component . in the absence of first - principles calculation",
    ", we will use the decay mode @xmath82 or @xmath83 to fix @xmath84 @xcite .    the calculated branching ratios of resonant and nonresonant contributions to @xmath44 and @xmath5 are summarized in tables [ tab : kpkmk0 ] and [ tab : k0pi0pi0 ] , respectively .",
    "the theoretical errors shown there are from the uncertainties in ( i ) the parameter @xmath61 which governs the momentum dependence of the nonresonant amplitude [ cf",
    "( [ eq : adalitz ] ) ] , ( ii ) the strange quark mass @xmath85 , the form factor @xmath86 and the nonresonant contribution @xmath84 constrained by the @xmath4 rate , and ( iii ) the unitarity angle @xmath87 .",
    "we see that the predicted rates for resonant and nonresonant components are consistent with experiment .",
    "the nonresonant background arises dominantly from the transition process ( 90% ) via the scalar density induced vacuum to @xmath88 transition , namely , @xmath73 , and slightly from the current - induced process ( 3% ) . in the @xmath5 mode ,",
    "the nonresonant fraction is found to be of order 40% .",
    "recall that large nonresonant contributions to the decays @xmath89 and @xmath90 , at the level of @xmath91 , have been reported by belle @xcite .    .branching ratios ( in units of @xmath92 ) of resonant and nonresonant ( nr ) contributions to @xmath80 .",
    "theoretical errors correspond to the uncertainties in ( i ) @xmath93 , ( ii ) @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath94 , and ( iii ) @xmath87 .",
