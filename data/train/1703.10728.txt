    "the most basic observational property of an x - ray source is its flux which , under the assumption of a radiation pattern , can be translated to a luminosity .",
    "ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are non - nuclear objects found in external galaxies that appear to be very luminous under the assumption of isotropic emission . the majority of ulxs are thought to be x - ray binaries powered by accretion onto a compact object and their luminosities are comparable to or above the eddington luminosity of stellar black holes .",
    "thus , ulxs offer a means to study either accretion near and above the eddington limit , if the compact objects are stellar mass black holes , or unusually massive black holes @xcite .",
    "the key physical properties of an ultraluminous x - ray binary are the mass , spin , and nature ( black hole or neutron star ) of the compact object , the nature of the companion star , and the orbital separation and eccentricity .",
    "these are related via the geometry and dynamics of the accretion flow , particularly the accretion rate , to the observed x - ray , optical / uv / ir , and radio emission from the system . in the following ,",
    "we first review the observational properties of ulxs including x - ray spectroscopy and timing and studies of their multiwavelength counterparts .",
    "we then discuss models for ulxs with emphasis on super - eddington accretion and review the evidence for unusually massive black holes in ulxs .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the implications of the knowledge gleaned from studies of ulxs for other topics in astrophysics .",
    "the _ einstein _ observatory obtained the first resolved images of external galaxies that enabled the discovery of the first ulxs @xcite .",
    "ulxs are defined as point - like sources within or near the optical extent of a host galaxy , but away from the nucleus in order to exclude accreting supermassive black holes .",
    "if defined strictly on the observed flux , the ulx population contains a small number of bright supernovae and supernova remnants .",
    "young rotation - powered pulsars may theoretically reach sufficiently high luminosities @xcite , but no example has been identified .",
    "x - ray binaries can be distinguished by their irregular variability and relatively dim optical counterparts .",
    "this review focuses on ultraluminous x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "several different threshold luminosities have been used in classifying ulxs .",
    "when introducing the term ` ultraluminous compact x - ray sources ' , @xcite used the eddington limit for a @xmath0 neutron star .",
    "a common definition in use today is @xmath1 which is convenient in cgs units and tends to be used for population studies as it produces larger samples .",
    "another commonly used definition is @xmath2 which closely corresponds to the eddington luminosity for a 20  @xmath3 black hole , more massive than any stellar black hole observed within the milky way @xcite , and use of this definition is an attempt to establish ulxs as a class physically distinct from stellar - mass x - ray binaries found in the milky way .    the x - ray luminosity functions ( xlfs ) of actively star - forming and old elliptical galaxies are shown in figure  [ fig : xlf ] .",
    "the xlf for star - forming galaxies has a break at ( 12@xmath4 @xcite , while that for ellipticals has a break at @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the xlfs are plotted assuming isotropic luminosity .",
    "beaming , which reaches a factor of 2 for a thin accretion disk and potentially higher for other accretion geometries ( section  [ sec : timing ] ) , could shift an observed luminosity break above the physical luminosity at which the break occurs .",
    "hence , the break in the elliptical xlf may correspond to the eddington luminosity for neutron stars and may suggest that there are few black hole x - ray binaries in such galaxies .",
    "the original definition of a ulx in terms of the eddington limit for a @xmath0 neutron star , after allowing for beaming from a thin disk , is justified by the break in the xlf of elliptical galaxies .",
    "the break in the star - forming xlf would correspond to objects 20 times as massive .",
    "however , the lack of a break near the neutron star eddington luminosity in the star - forming xlf , together with the fact that neutron star binaries are estimated to be 1050 times more numerous than black hole binaries @xcite , calls into question if either xlf break is related to an eddington luminosity . ulxs with luminosities up to the break therefore appear to be part of the same population as standard x - ray binaries .",
    "sources with luminosities above the break , @xmath6 , could represent a new class of objects .",
    "interestingly , extreme objects with luminosities above the break do exist .",
    "the first example was found in m82 @xcite and the term ` hyperluminous x - ray source ' ( hlx ) was first used in @xcite .",
    "hlxs are defined as sources reaching a peak luminosity of at least @xmath7 @xcite and ones with luminosities up to @xmath8 have been found and are discussed below .",
    "these sources may be the best candidates for intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) .",
    "the first systematic surveys of nearby galaxies for x - ray binaries were done using the _ rntgensatellit _ high resolution imager @xcite .",
    "chandra _ x - ray observatory greatly increased the sensitivity and , critically , enabled accurate source localization .",
    "background active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and foreground stars often masquerade as ulxs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these contaminates can be revealed by bright , point - like optical counterparts if accurate positions are available .",
    "@xcite identified 107 ulx candidates ( @xmath9 ) in a complete sample of galaxies within 14.5  mpc and with masses above @xmath10 , giving a local ulx density of one per 57 mpc@xmath11 .",
    "their xlf predicts at most one hlx ( @xmath12 ) within 100  mpc , requiring a distinct population to explain the observed hlxs .",

    "@xcite present a catalog of 470 ulx candidates in 238 nearby galaxies with an estimated contamination of @xmath1320% .",
    "the x - ray binary population of a galaxy is linearly correlated with both its star formation rate and stellar mass @xcite .",
    "dominance of the former in star forming galaxies suggests that their ulx population is young with ages of tens of myr , while dominance of the latter in elliptical galaxies suggest their ulx population is old with ages of gyr .",
    "ulxs are preferentially associated with star - forming galaxies , as can be inferred from the xlfs , and also with the star forming regions within galaxies @xcite .",
    "production of ulxs , per unit star formation rate , increases at sub - solar metallicities @xcite and is enhanced by a factor of @xmath14 in number @xcite and @xmath15 in total x - ray luminosity @xcite at very low metalliticies , @xmath16 .",
    "the maximum stellar black hole mass also increases at low metallicity , which could decrease the need for super - eddington accretion in ulxs @xcite .",
    "x - ray binaries within the milky way have been extensively studied and are an important benchmark in studying ulxs @xcite .",
    "galactic black hole x - ray binaries ( gbhbs ) exhibit pronounced variability with the x - ray flux changing by a factor as large as @xmath17 in some cases @xcite .",
    "the majority of gbhbs have low - mass companion stars and are transient objects that are usually in a quiescent state and flare to high luminosities , sometimes approaching the eddington limit , for weeks to months .",
    "in contrast , most ulxs are persistent for years or decades .",
    "ulxs in elliptical galaxies typically have low levels of variability @xcite .",
    "ulxs in star - forming galaxies are variable by factors often reaching 10 @xcite .",
    "variability by large factors , exceeding 100 , is unusual , but seen in some ulxs , ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "gbhbs exhibit a variety of x - ray spectral / timing states thought to be connected with the accretion rate and geometry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the x - ray spectra are commonly modeled as the sum of a multicolor disk blackbody component thought to arise from the accretion disk and a power - law or comptonization component thought to arise from a corona .",
    "power spectra of the x - ray variability typically show broadband noise extending from low frequencies up to about 10  hz and sometimes exhibit quasiperiodic oscillations ( qpos ) .",
    "a typical transient gbhb exhibits one or more spectral / timing states during outburst .",
    "outbursts typically begin and end in the _ hard _ state which shows a power - law x - ray spectrum with a hard photon index ( @xmath18 ) and strong variability on short timescales @xcite .",
    "the hard state is usually accompanied by a compact radio jet . during the outburst , the source may enter into the _ thermal _ state , the _ steep power law _ state , or one or more intermediate states that are less clearly defined . in the _ thermal _ state ,",
    "the accretion disk dominates the spectrum , fast variability is weak , and the compact radio jet is absent .",
    "the _ steep power law _",
    "state or _ very high _ state @xcite has strong emission from both the disk and a power - law component with a steep photon index , @xmath19 and is seen at luminosities approaching the eddington limit .",
    "this state often exhibits qpos , including ones at high frequency .",
    "spectral variability provides a strong test of the canonical gbhb spectral model .",
    "in particular , if the disk component truly represents a standard thin accretion disk extending all the way to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) around the black hole , then the disk should have a constant inner radius .",
    "in that case , the bolometric disk luminosity , @xmath20 , and the disk inner temperature , @xmath21 , should be related as @xmath22 .",
    "this is demonstrated with good accuracy in the thermal state of gbhbs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the radius of the isco is a function of only the black hole mass and spin , so the normalization of the relation can be used to infer the black hole mass given a spin value .",
    "it is interesting to ask how , or even if , ulxs relate to these sub - eddington spectral states .",
    "however , before we do , we need to introduce an important caveat . while it is common to directly compare the shape of ulx spectra and those of gbhbs , most observational results for the two classes are subject to a bandpass mismatch .",
    "observational data for gbhbs has predominantly been gathered by instruments designed for galactic science , primarily gas proportional counters , such as the proportional counter array on the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) , that have limited sensitivity below 3 kev but large collecting area at high energies up to @xmath1325  kev . in contrast , ulxs are generally observed by observatories that are more specifically designed for extra - galactic science , with ccd detectors and focusing optics , and so operate in the @xmath130.510  kev regime .",
    "observations of ulxs therefore go much softer than those of bhbs , and so are sensitive to soft features that are not observed in many bhb datasets .",
    "similarly most ulx datasets , before the advent of nustar , were not sensitive to the hard spectral components seen in gbhb data .",
    "this should be borne in mind when interpreting ulx data .",
    "our first views of ulx spectra in the 0.510  kev band , where there is sufficient bandpass to start discriminating between physical models , emerged from the _ asca _ mission in the late 1990s @xcite .",
    "these data showed that many ulxs have spectra that appear to be dominated by a single spectral component that is somewhat convex in shape , and so can be fitted with accretion disk models @xcite .",
    "these disks are both hotter ( with @xmath23 kev ) and more luminous than those seen in gbhbs , and @xcite suggested this is a consequence of ulxs hosting larger stellar mass black holes , up to @xmath24 in order to remain sub - eddington , that are rapidly rotating , causing the accretion disk to move closer to the black hole and heat up . some ulxs also show _ asca _ spectra that appear power - law dominated in some epochs ( e.g. two ulxs in ic 342 , * ? ? ?",
    "while these can be interpreted as a high luminosity manifestation of the hard state , @xcite note that a strongly comptonized disk spectrum provides a better physical explanation , consistent with objects in the steep power - law / very high state .",
    "early ulx studies with both _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ also largely used similar single component models to fit ulx spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , it quickly became apparent from deeper observations , particularly with _ xmm - newton _ but also with _ chandra _ , that single component models in the form of power - laws or simple accretion disk models such as the standard multi - color disk blackbody ( dbb ) are statistically excluded in virtually all cases with sufficiently high spectral quality .",
    "the spectra required either the inclusion of a second component or more complex single component models to obtain adequate fits .",
    "we focus our discussion below on these models .",
    "we note that where the data quality is low , e.g.  in short exposures or distant galaxies , single component models can not be statistically excluded ; however , this should not be taken as evidence that the ulx spectra have that physical origin , e.g.  an acceptable hard power - law fit alone is not sufficient evidence to indicate the x - ray hard state .      the first good quality _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ spectra were fitted with the same two - component model used in gbhbs : a soft accretion disk and a power - law .",
    "when fitted to many ulx spectra this results in very cool inner disk temperatures , @xmath25 around 0.10.3  kev , and relatively hard power - laws , @xmath263 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "crucially , if this disk temperature represents that of the innermost stable circular orbit around the black hole , then we expect that @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the black hole mass , for fixed eddington ratio and black hole spin .",
    "scaling from the typical temperatures of gbhbs in the thermal dominant state of @xmath131  kev , this would imply that imbhs with masses @xmath29 are present in many ulxs .",
    "however , in the ulx spectra , the power - law dominates above 1  kev , which is in sharp contrast to gbhb spectra in the thermal dominant state where the disk dominates in the 2 - 10  kev band .",
    "there are other technical issues in that continuation of the power - law to lower energies is unphysical , the absorption column density is usually strongly correlated with the disk temperature and flux complicating estimation of the latter , and the fits often have a second local minimum with a hotter disk ( @xmath30  0.82.5  kev ) and a steep power - law ( @xmath31  24.5 ) .",

    "if modeled as a dbb plus power - law , the power - law component acts to broaden the disk spectrum by emerging from beneath the disk spectrum at one or both ends of the spectrum .",
    "the spectrum shown is a @xmath35-free disk model with @xmath38 .",

    "the absorption is @xmath46 in all cases and is responsible for the edge features below 1  kev.,width=432 ]    perhaps more importantly , higher quality _ xmm - newton _ data revealed that the hard emission is not a power - law ; it shows curvature in the 210  kev band ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the curvature is well described by a break at energies of 27  kev @xcite , well below the breaks seen in gbhb which are typically @xmath1360  kev or above @xcite .",
    "hence the canonical gbhb x - ray spectral model does not apply to ulxs and interpretation of the cool component as the disk of an imbh accreting in a sub - eddington state appears very questionable .",
    "indeed , the general appearance of the ulx spectra , a hard component displaying curvature and a soft excess , does not directly map on to any of the standard sub - eddington states .",
    "the two - component spectra are almost always seen at luminosities above @xmath2 .",
    "it was therefore proposed that this may represent a super - eddington _ ultraluminous _ ( ul ) state @xcite .",
    "a physically - motivated two - component model , based on the physical interpretation of the canonical gbhb model , is a dbb plus comptonized corona . in these",
    "the disk temperature is again cool , @xmath25 around 0.10.3  kev , but in contrast to gbhbs where the coronae are hot and thin ( with electron temperature @xmath47 kev and optical depth @xmath48 ) , the coronae of ulxs appear cool and thick with @xmath4912  kev and @xmath33 .",
    "the relative flux of the disk and corona component varies .",
    "those in which the hot component dominates are ` hard ul ' spectra , while the cool component dominates in ` soft ul ' spectra @xcite .",
    "illustrative examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ulxspecs ] .",
    "these fits led to the suggestion that the inner accretion disks of ulxs are shrouded by an optically - thick corona leaving only the outer regions of the disk visible as the soft excess .",
    "a model based on this scenario , including energy coupling of the corona and disk , was used by @xcite to recover temperatures of the underlying accretion disk of @xmath50  kev in most ( but not all ) cases , consistent with stellar - mass black holes .",
    "however , two component spectra such as those observed might also be expected from supercritical accretion disks ( section  [ sec : bhsupereddmodels ] ) .",
    "some high quality ulx spectra appear more like a single , broad continuum than two distinct components , and can be well fitted with the @xmath35-free disk model , where the radial temperature profile of the disk is allowed to vary as @xmath51 .",
    "these show @xmath52 , as expected if the disk becomes radiatively inefficient due to the advection of radiation in its interior .",
    "this exponent is lower than the @xmath53 of a standard thin disk which broadens the range of temperatures contributing to the emission and therefore the resulting energy spectrum .",
    "these spectra are referred to as ` broadened disk ' ( bd ) .",
    "bd spectra are seen to dominate below luminosities of @xmath2 .",
    "they are also seen from several objects with luminosities well above @xmath54 , for example ulxs in ngc 5907 @xcite and ngc 5643 @xcite .",
    "it is unclear whether this resemblance to lower - luminosity bd spectra is due to the same underlying physical processes or represents a different spectral regime .    beyond confirming the spectral curvature at high energies found with _",
    "xmm - newton _ , several simultaneous _ nustar_/_xmm - newton",
    "_ spectra hint at the presence of an additional hard component .",
    "the strongest detection is in ho ii x-1 @xcite and the emission can be modeled as an optically thin , hot or non - thermal electron scattering corona with @xmath55 , as seen in gbhbs in the steep power - law / very high state .",
    "if this is a corona then it signifies that the hard component of the @xmath56 kev spectrum can not be a corona ; instead it is most likely emission from the inner regions of the accretion disk , see section  [ sec : bhsupereddmodels ] .",
    "there is a sub - class of ulxs for which most of the flux is emitted below 1 or 2 kev .",
    "the spectra of these very soft or supersoft ulxs can be decomposed into a dominant blackbody component , with a temperature typically of 100  ev , and a minor power - law component that extends to high energies with @xmath572 - 4 .",
    "these supersoft ulxs ( ssulxs ) are also referred to as ultraluminous supersoft x - ray sources or ulss @xcite .",
    "only a handful of these sources have been well studied .",
    "the observed luminosities of these sources are mostly around or below @xmath58 , although their inferred luminosities once absorption is removed are often much higher @xcite .",
    "we have so far dealt with ulx spectra as continua .",
    "however , all are subject to absorption from cold , neutral material along our line of sight to the ulx , whether it lies in our galaxy , the host galaxy of the ulx , or is intrinsic to the ulx itself .",
    "however , establishing the correct absorption columns to ulxs using continuum modeling is fraught with uncertainty , as the measured absorption is strongly dependent upon the continuum model used , e.g.  power - laws return far higher columns than disk models due to the absorption being the sole cause of the low - energy downturn in spectra modeled by a power - law .",
    "in general , most models show that ulxs are not subject to very high columns , with typical absorption columns of @xmath13(13)@xmath59 in excess of galactic foreground absorption , although there are a minority of objects with higher absorption ( e.g.  ic 342 x-2 with a column above @xmath60 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite suggest that these columns are not local to the ulx , but instead consistent with the line - of - sight in the host galaxy , based on early _ xmm - newton _ data",
    ". however , some ulxs do show evidence that their column varies which puts this is doubt @xcite .",
    "there are also additional uncertainties caused by the metallicity of the neutral absorber ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "early _ asca _ spectroscopy of ulxs revealed that individual ulxs can display different spectra in different observational epochs ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "perhaps the simplest way of tracking this spectral variability with time is through x - ray color analyses .",
    "@xcite monitored ngc 5204 x-1 with _",

    "subsequent studies have concentrated mainly on the large monitoring datasets for individual ulxs acquired by _",

    ".    however , x - ray spectral data from large telescopes are usually good enough that it is more useful to directly contrast the spectra obtained in different epochs .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite did this for a small number of ulxs observed on multiple occasions by _ xmm - newton_. both found correlated @xmath61 behavior for some ulxs that could be modeled as power - laws , though the direction of this behavior changed in different ulxs : some softened , and others hardened , at higher luminosities .",
    "@xcite found that four ulxs that could be fitted with single component disk - like spectra showed positive disk luminosity versus temperature evolution , as seen from gbhbs . in contrast , @xcite studied the evolution of disk luminosity and temperature in the ( cool ) dbb plus power - law model for ngc 1313 x-2 and found that the disk luminosity decreases with temperature , in strong contrast to @xmath62 relation expected for an accretion disk with a fixed inner radius .",

    "ulxs reach significantly higher luminosities and if some fraction of ulxs host stellar - mass black holes , then they must also be super - eddington accretors .",
    "there is substantial evidence for strong outflows from ulxs from the presence of shock - powered optical and radio giant bubble nebulae ( section  [ sec : nebulae ] ) , broad optical emission lines ( section  [ sec : optoutflows ] ) , and blue - shifted x - ray absorption features ( section  [ sec : xrayoutflows ] ) .",
    "the kinetic energy required in the outflow is often comparable to or larger than the x - ray luminosity and suggests that a large fraction of the total energy release of the accretion flow goes into powering an outflow .",
    "these strong outflows are additional evidence in favor of super - eddington accretion in ulxs . in this section ,",
    "we examine the mechanisms whereby the mass transfer for super - eddington accretion may arise and models of the accretion flow near the compact object .      the first requirement in exceeding the eddington limit",
    "is that there must be a sufficient transfer of material towards the compact object to power the extreme energy release .",
    "we can infer the mass transfer rate from the companion star , @xmath149 , from the bolometric luminosity @xmath150 of an accreting system as    @xmath151    where @xmath152 is the radiative efficiency of the accretion flow . taking a value of @xmath153 , appropriate for efficient conversion of accreted mass to radiation with little or no outflow ,",
    "a mass transfer rate of @xmath154 is required for a bolometric luminosity of @xmath58 . as the eddington luminosity @xmath155 for a compact object of mass @xmath156 ( in solar units )",
    "accreting hydrogen , the mass transfer rate to reach the eddington limit can be given as    @xmath157    hence , a @xmath158 black hole requires a mean accretion rate in excess of @xmath159 to exceed its eddington limit .",
    "this is far in excess of the mass transfer rates in typical galactic systems  for example , an lmxb undergoing roche lobe overflow with an average outburst luminosity @xmath160 , and a duty cycle of 0.01 , requires an average mass transfer rate of @xmath161 ; a persistent wind - fed hmxb with an average luminosity of @xmath162 requires @xmath163 of mass transfer .",
    "how then is such a high mass transfer rate achieved ?",
    "the best candidate appears to be thermal - timescale mass transfer in high mass binaries @xcite , which occurs when the massive secondary star in a binary containing a compact object evolves into the hertzsprung gap and expands , so filling its roche lobe .",
    "@xcite used binary evolution models to show that the mass transfer might be high enough during main sequence evolution to fuel a ulx , if the secondary is more massive than @xmath164 ; however the accretion rates peaked at a factor @xmath165 higher during the thermal - timescale phase .",
    "the mass transfer rates during this epoch can be very extreme , for example @xcite show that a stellar - mass black hole accreting from a similarly - massive star in the thermal - timescale phase can have a mass transfer rate of @xmath166 for @xmath167 yr .",
    "they also show a neutron star undergoing thermal - timescale mass transfer from a helium - burning secondary with mass @xmath1312  @xmath3 will see even higher mass transfer rates of @xmath168 for @xmath169  yr .",
    "these results were expanded on by @xcite , who show that stable mass transfer is possible for a wide range of binary parameters , including for high secondary star / black hole mass ratios , with mass transfer rates of @xmath170 regularly reached during the @xmath171  yr thermal - timescale mass transfer stage . however",
    ", this may not be the only situation that can fuel super - eddington accretion ; @xcite suggests that long - lasting transient outbursts in wide orbital separation lmxbs ( such as grs 1915 + 105 ) are capable of depositing material onto a black hole at highly super - eddington rates .",
    "it is clear , then , that the necessary mass accretion rates for super - eddington ulxs are physically plausible .",
    "neutron star accretion is a complex situation since the stellar radiating surface and potentially high magnetic field may strongly influence the accretion process .",
    "the discovery of pulsations in m82 x-2 ( section  [ sec : timing ] ) has prompted the development of models to explain how to apparently exceed the eddington limit by a factor @xmath172 .",
    "a key parameter is the strength of the neutron star magnetic field , while two key observational diagnostics on the accretion rate are the luminosity and the pulse frequency derivative .",
    "it is usually assumed that the flow at large radii will be via a standard accretion disk . at the alfvn or magnetospheric radius , @xmath173 , defined as the location where the magnetic pressure balances the ram pressure of the flow , the accretion flow transitions from following keplerian orbits to following magnetic field lines .",
    "however , accretion onto the neutron star surface will proceed only when the angular velocity of the accretion disk at @xmath173 is higher than that of the neutron star ; so that the gravitation force at the boundary exceeds the centripetal acceleration of matter tied to the magnetic field lines .",
    "if the accretion rate is low , the magnetospheric radius recedes from the star and accretion is stopped or greatly slowed .",
    "this is the ` propeller effect ' .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath173 and the difference between the keplerian angular velocity at @xmath173 and the angular velocity of the neutron star determine the torque produced by the accretion flow on the neutron star and hence the secular pulse frequency derivative ( the frequency also changes due to orbital motion ) .    for strong fields ,",
    "the accretion flow is magnetically threaded on to the neutron star and near the neutron star surface , the flow has the geometry of a column or funnel .",
    "this provides a geometric means to exceed the eddington limit as radiation can escape from the sides of the funnel , perpendicular to the flow .",
    "@xcite estimate a maximum enhancement of @xmath174 .",
    "if the magnetic field is sufficiently high , @xmath175  g , near the funnel , then the field will restrict the motion perpendicular to the field lines of electrons in the flow , reducing their scattering cross - section to below the thomson value for photons polarized perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "this provides another means to exceed the eddington limit .",
    "@xcite estimate the accretion rate onto m82 x-2 via the pulse frequency derivative assuming that the system is in spin equilibrium as may be expected given the short spin - up timescale , @xmath176  yr .",
    "they find a rate only a few times higher than eddington and infer @xmath177  g. they suggest that the large apparent luminosity is due to beaming .",
    "however , the sinusoidal pulse profile is inconsistent with the narrow beam expected if there is significant beaming , unless we view a fan beam at a favorable inclination .",
    "this appears untenable now that three ulx pulsars all show sinusoidal pulse profiles .",
    "@xcite suggest that the mass accretion rate was underestimated because the torque is due to differential rotation between the disk and neutron star at @xmath173 and is therefore small if the system is near spin equilibrium .",
    "they estimate that the dipole field is @xmath178  g and suggest that there may be stronger multipole fields near the neutron surface that could allow the observed luminosity via opacity reduction . @xcite",
    "similarly suggest that luminosities of @xmath179 can be achieved for @xmath180  g. @xcite interpret the system as having @xmath181  g , only mild beaming consistent with the sinusoidal profile , and note that the low luminosity state may be due to the propeller effect .",
    "@xcite found a bimodal luminosity distribution for m82 x-2 that they ascribe to the propeller effect and use to infer @xmath182  g. the other two ulx pulsars also show strong variability that may be due to the propeller effect .",
    "for the ulx pulsar in ngc 5907 , the magnetic field inferred from the apparent luminosity is so high that object should be continually in the propeller regime . to resolve this conundrum , @xcite",
    "suggest that the neutron star has a strong , multipolar surface field , while only the weaker dipole component is important at the magnetospheric radius .",
    "models have also been suggested for lower magnetic field neutron stars .",
    "@xcite suggest that the accretion disk extends to the surface of the neutron star because the ratio of the pulse frequency derivative to the luminosity , assuming isotropic emission , implies that the accretion torque is applied at a radius comparable to the neutron star radius . in this case , the magnetic field would be weak , @xmath183  g , and a large fraction of the luminosity would be liberated in the disk , hence the considerations discussed below for super - eddington black hole accretors would apply .",
    "additional development of the models and their application to observational properties other than the apparent luminosity will be necessary to distinguish amongst them .",
    "for example , the bimodal luminosity distribution of m82 x-2 appears to favor interpretation in terms of the propeller effect and a strong magnetic field .",
    "such an effect would not be expected for a low magnetic field star in which the disk extends to the stellar surface . the observed sinusoidal pulse shape and the energy dependence of the pulsed fraction",
    "could be compared with sufficiently developed models .",
    "also , future observatories with x - ray polarimetric detectors may be able to distinguish between these different proposed magnetic fields .",
    "given that neutron star binaries are estimated to be 1050 times more numerous than black hole binaries @xcite , it is reasonable to ask if a large fraction of ulxs host neutron stars . in some models , beaming is predicted to be stronger by factors @xmath184 in neutron stars compared to black holes , which could compensate for the lower eddington limits of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "since the magnetic field should lose strength as it is buried by accretion , a large proportion of the ulx population may be neutron stars that do not exhibit pulsations @xcite .",
    "conversely , highly super - eddington emission from neutron stars may require such high magnetic fields that they are quite rare @xcite .",
    "it may be possible to make progress on this question observationally .",
    "the x - ray luminosity function of star - forming galaxies shows no break around the eddington luminosity for a neutron star , consistent with a constant neutron star fraction even at the highest luminosities .",
    "the spectrum of ngc 7793 p13 certainly resembles other ulx spectra with its two - component form , albeit it is relatively hard @xcite .",
    "ngc 5907 ulx appears disk - like , similar to some other ulxs at their highest luminosities @xcite .",
    "m82 x-2 , on the other hand , may not show a turnover in its spectrum below 10 kev , unlike most ulxs @xcite .",
    "the variability seen from the ulx pulsars is of significantly larger amplitude than seen from most ulxs and may suggest that pulsars represent a relatively small fraction of the ulx population .",
    "also , the one unique optical counterpart of a ulx pulsar appears different from other ulxs .",
    "the optical light , in some accretion states , is dominated by the companion star rather than the accretion disc and its wind as is typical for ulxs ( section  [ sec : companion ] ) . hence , there are tantalizing suggestions that observational indicators other than pulsations might help us distinguish this new class .",
    "one simple way of exceeding the eddington limit is anisotropic emission , in which case the accretion rate need not even exceed the eddington limit for an object to appear super - eddington if viewed along the correct sight line @xcite .",
    "such _ beaming _ can take two forms : relativistic and geometric .",
    "in the former case , we view a standard x - ray binary directly along the beam of its jet ( i.e. as a ` microblazar ' ) , which could boost its apparent luminosity by a factor 77 for a lorentz factor @xmath185 , although this would only be seen for the 2% of binaries that we view at the correct angle @xcite .",
    "however , as we have seen , ulx spectra do not appear similar to the power - law spectra we would expect from such beamed jets .",
    "geometric ( or mild ) beaming could be the result of structure in the accretion disk limiting the escape of photons such that they preferentially emerge in the directions of lowest scattering optical depth , i.e.  along the rotational poles @xcite .",
    "the high disk scale heights necessary for this effect do not naturally occur in sub - eddington disks ; they may instead be a natural consequence of disks undergoing super - eddington accretion .",
    "the eddington limit refers specifically to globally isotropic accretion ; this is of course not the geometry in which disk accretion occurs .",
    "in fact , for disk accretion the infall direction of the material ( radially through the disk , towards the black hole ) and the preferential direction for radiative energy release ( upwards from the disk surface ) are to first order perpendicular , and so the radiation should not necessarily be expected to act to limit the accretion rate on a global scale .",
    "that disks can exceed the eddington limit has been hypothesized since disk accretion theory was formulated @xcite ; this has led to a variety of models for how disks work in this supercritical accretion regime .",
    "one early model was the so - called ` polish doughnut ' model , named for the tight , torus - like structure it predicted for the supercritical disk ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the central regions of these axisymmetric , rotating accretion flows are optically and geometrically thick , with their height above the disk mid - plane @xmath186 , at a radius @xmath187 , supported by radiation pressure .",
    "@xcite showed that    @xmath188    where @xmath189 is the schwarzschild radius and @xmath190 where @xmath191 and @xmath192 are the specific angular momentum and its value at the inner boundary of the disk , respectively .",
    "hence , for accretion rates that exceed eddington by factors 15 or more , the disk height @xmath193 in its innermost regions . this can create narrow funnels of optically thick material around the rotation axis that could readily beam the x - ray emission from nearest the black hole towards an observer .",
    "however , limitations of this model include that it only applies if the disk is radiatively efficient , and it ignores physical processes in the disk interior . in fact , in geometrically thick super - eddington disks , we should expect that the inflow time for material in the disk is shorter than the diffusion time for photons to reach the last scattering surface of the disk and radiate away ; photons are therefore trapped in the disk , and advected into the black hole .",
    "models that take this effect into account are generally termed ` slim disk ' models @xcite , that are characterized by low radiative efficiencies and , as equation ( 3 ) is modified in proportion to the radiative efficiency , hence @xmath194 .",
    "although much work has focussed on slim disks occurring at around the eddington rate @xcite , recent studies have shown that advection acts to limit the disk height and , as a result , degree of beaming at all super - eddington rates , such that we should always expect the disks to be slim rather than very geometrically thick @xcite .",
    "indeed , a further set of models predict that super - eddington accretion and , in particular , radiation release is possible from thin disks if extreme accretion rates exacerbate their internal density inhomogeneities and lead to the non - linear development of photon bubbles .",
    "this results in the disk becoming somewhat porous to radiation from the interior of the disk , permitting it to escape , hence the epithet ` leaky disks ' @xcite .",
    "a further characteristic of super - eddington accretion is that the eddington limit always applies locally ; thus excess material will be driven from the disk , in the form of a massive wind .",
    "this becomes important when the mass transfer rate exceeds @xmath195 @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the outer parts of the accretion disk remain geometrically thin down to a certain radius @xmath196 , the spherization radius , where @xmath197 in units of the inner disk radius @xmath198 . within this radius",
    "the disk becomes geometrically thick as radiation pressure inflates it , and any excess material is removed from the disk s upper layers in the form of a radiation - pressure driven wind .",
    "this wind will be very massive and will remain optically thick as it moves away from the disk , thereby providing collimation of the x - ray emission from the central regions .",
    "sufficient material is lost in the wind that ( in the absence of advection ) the accretion rate at the inner edge of the disk should be equal to @xmath199 .",
    "in such a model , we can express the apparent luminosity of a ulx as    @xmath200 \\label{eqn : beaming_logmdot}\\ ] ]    where @xmath201 is the beaming factor @xcite , and this varies with the accretion rate ( in eddington units ) as @xmath202 @xcite .",
    "this model of a geometrically thick disk and a radiation - driven wind derives directly from the supercritical disk model first described by @xcite , and more recently expanded on by @xcite and @xcite . here",
    "we briefly describe its structure , based on these works , and present a schematic in figure  [ fig : supeddmodel ] .    , and",
    "within this radius a massive , optically - thick outflow is blown from the top of the disk by radiation pressure ( the wind , in yellow ) , which persists down to @xmath203 .",
    "the wind is clumpy in nature , but as it moves away from the disk the wind material diffuses perpendicular to its path of motion , illustrated by the expanding blob blown from @xmath196 .",
    "however , the wind remains optically thick well beyond the region shown , with the outer photosphere ( region to @xmath204 ) extending well over the disk .",
    "this geometry results in harder spectra for lines of sight close to the rotation axis of the black hole ( 1 ) , softer spectra as the line of sight crosses the wind ( 2 ) , and ultrasoft or uv - dominated spectra for lines of sight that view only the outer photosphere ( 3).,width=384 ]    the structure of a supercritical flow can be divided into 3 main zones , demarcated by three different radii : @xmath203 , the inner edge of the photosphere at which the optical depth of the photosphere drops to unity ; @xmath196 ; and @xmath204 , the outer edge of the photosphere at which the optical depth of the photosphere drops to unity .",
    "these zones are :    * * zone a : @xmath205 .",
    "* at the smallest disk radii the wind is optically thin to electron scattering in the vertical direction , and the x - ray emission resembles a distorted , hot accretion disk . * * zone b : @xmath206 . * the wind is opaque in this region , becoming effectively a vertical extension of the inflow .",
    "advection is important in this material , and so it has a @xmath207 temperature profile , with the radiation escaping at a radius roughly double that of where it is produced as it is advected by the wind . *",
    "* zone c @xmath208 . *",
    "the optical depth of the wind blown into this region falls as @xmath209 , and so the radiation emerges at approximately the radius it is produced .",
    "the temperature profile appears as the classic disk @xmath210 profile , with roughly the eddington luminosity generated in this region .",
    "crucially , the geometry of the supercritical accretion scenario ( illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : supeddmodel ] ) means that different zones will be visible at different viewing angles for the system , hence its predicted appearance varies as a function of inclination to the line of sight .",
    "for example , the line of sight to the central regions of the accretion flow ( 1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : supeddmodel ] ) will be dominated by the inner disk , with this emission enhanced by beaming up the evacuated funnel . at intermediate angles ( 2 )",
    ", the view will pass through the wind , and so be dominated by the soft , thermal component with a temperature similar to that at the spherization radius . at the largest inclination angles ( 3 ) the view will be of the outer photosphere , that will be much cooler to the point that its emission will be predominantly in the uv regime .",
    "changes in the accretion rate affect the mass flow entering the wind and therefore the wind scale height , thus changing the appearance at fixed inclination .    the validity of the main features of this model have been confirmed via numerical simulations .",
    "these require the use of advanced radiation - magnetohydrodynamics ( rmhd ) , or general relativistic rmhd codes , to fully simulate the conditions in accretion flows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these models confirm the presence of a large scale height inflow , a powerful outflow , and a central evacuated funnel .",
    "however , they show some differences to the analytical predictions .",
    "@xcite find a clumpy wind that they suggest is due to rayleigh - taylor instabilities .",
    "in addition , @xcite and @xcite find that vertical advection of radiation caused by magnetic buoyancy increases radiation escape from the disk producing an efficiency not too dissimilar to standard disks , @xmath211 , although the location of the bulk of the radiation release differs strongly between these models .",
    "interestingly , these models do not display any hint of photon bubbles @xcite , likely due to the turbulent nature of the disk interiors .",
    "* ultraluminous ( ul )  * the spectra are distinctly two - component .",
    "the soft thermal component is thought to arise from the inner photosphere within the outflow and can be modeled with a simple blackbody or a multicolor black body with a temperature of 0.10.3  kev .",
    "the hard component is thought to arise from the hot , inner regions of the accretion disk and can be modeled as a dbb or optically thick corona with temperatures of @xmath212  kev .",
    "hard ul spectra would correspond to low inclination sight lines ( near # 1 in fig  [ fig : supeddmodel ] ) where the inner disk is prominent .",
    "soft ul spectra would arise from moderation inclination ( near # 2 in the figure ) where the view of the inner disk is reduced and that of the photosphere is increased .",
    "the spectra may correspond to large inclinations ( near # 3 in the figure ) .",
    "the inner disk would then be obscured and the spectrum dominated by emission from the outer and cooler photosphere .",
    "ssul spectra may also arise when the accretion rate increases to the extent that the outflow covers the disk at most inclinations .",
    "the spectra are thought to be dominated by the accretion - disk , but with the disk structure modified from the standard thin disk due to the high accretion rate . for the bulk of the bd population near @xmath58 this could correspond to near eddington accretion rates , but the much more luminous examples may need a different explanation , for example they may be ul objects viewed down the funnel where the beamed inner disk emission dominates the x - ray spectrum .",
    "x - ray spectra are indicative of the processes within the inner accretion flow , and so can tell us much about whether the flows are behaving as we would expect for a super - eddington flow . here , we attempt to relate models of super - eddington accretion to the observational results on ulxs presented above .",
    "the sidebar `` super - eddington spectral regimes '' describes the phenomenological classification of the ultraluminous spectral regimes presented in section  [ sec : xrayspectra ] and graphically in fig .",
    "[ fig : ulxspecs ] in terms of a super - critical accretion flow as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : supeddmodel ] .",
    "we note that the similarity of the ulx pulsar spectra to the spectra discussed here raises a serious caveat in the interpretation of other ulx spectra in terms of black hole accretion .",
    "some ulx spectra can be interpreted in terms of the emission expected from ` slim disk ' models , where advection within the disk becomes a dominant process .",
    "this should change the relationship between luminosity and temperature , flattening it such that @xmath213 in the classic @xmath214 relationship for disk luminosity @xmath65 and temperature @xmath66 ; this is seen in ulxs @xcite .",
    "similarly , the radial emission profile of the disk temperature is @xmath215 at a radius @xmath187 , where @xmath53 is expected for a standard thin accretion disk , and @xmath216 for a slim disk .",
    "model fits with @xmath35 as a free parameter show that ulxs tend to have @xmath217 ; however this does not constitute a good fit to all high quality ulx spectra , with slim disks tending to fit better to bd spectra ( section  [ sec : contspec ] ) .",
    "in addition , a study of the highest quality data from a bd ulx , m33 x-8 , demonstrates that it does not behave as per the expectations of a simple slim disk @xcite , and a study of a transient ulx in m31 shows that advection does not alter its spectrum substantially from that predicted in a standard disk @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this remains a possible physical solution for many ulxs with bd spectra , for example a variable ulx in m83 @xcite .",
    "the two - component spectra of brighter ulxs have been physically interpreted via supercritical accretion models , with the soft component being emission from the inner photosphere within the outflowing wind @xcite and the hard component being the hot , inner disk emission @xcite .",
    "this differs from the original interpretation of the two - component ul spectra discussed above .",
    "the luminosity of the soft / wind component is then predicted to decrease with increasing temperature @xcite , in strong contrast with the expected behavior of a disk . as discussed in section  [ sec : spec_var ] , the soft component of ulx spectra fitted with two - component models generally show decreasing luminosity , both total and in the soft component , with increasing temperature @xcite , with a relationship @xmath218 @xcite .    in the supercritical model , the observational characteristics of ulxs should be a function of the viewing angle , with harder spectra for lines of sight close to the rotation axis of the black hole ( low inclination , # 1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : supeddmodel ] ) , softer spectra as the line of sight crosses the wind ( moderate inclination , # 2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : supeddmodel ] ) , and ultrasoft or uv - dominated spectra for lines of sight that view only the outer photosphere ( high inclination , # 3 in fig .",
    "[ fig : supeddmodel ] ) .",
    "for the latter , the observed x - ray luminosity should be low as the hot disk is hidden .",
    "these three lines of sight match the hard ul regime , the soft ul regime , and the ssul regime , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the wind height is predicted to increase with the accretion rate increasing the beaming of emission in the central funnel .",
    "hence , the observer s view of the disk versus wind emission will change with accretion rate . at low inclinations where the ulx is viewed down the funnel , the beaming of the hard component increases as @xmath219 while the soft component luminosity increases as @xmath149 , so the spectrum gets harder with increasing @xmath149 and becomes dominated by the hard component alone @xcite . at moderate inclination angles ,",
    "one would see the soft ( wind ) emission increase relative to the hard ( disk ) emission as the luminosity increases .",
    "@xcite see two ulxs that clearly demonstrate this latter behavior .",
    "accretion disks are known to precess , which could change our observed inclination angle ; this would manifest as spectral degeneracy with luminosity .",
    "spectral degeneracy has been seen in ulxs ( section  [ sec : spec_var ] ) .",
    "@xcite show that the spectral variability and degeneracy of ho ix x-1 fit into the patterns expected for variation of both accretion rate ( soft component @xmath220 and hard component @xmath221 for an object viewed into its funnel ) and inclination angle .",
    "the patterns of flux variability with spectral shape in ulxs also support a super - eddington interpretation .",
    "in particular , @xcite show that high levels of rms variability are not seen in hard ul or ( most ) bd observations ; yet they are common for soft ul spectra .",
    "this variability is much stronger above 1 kev than below and the spectrum of the variable component matches that of the hard component ( section  [ sec : lowfreqvar ] ) .",
    "this is best interpreted as extrinsic variability , imprinted on the hard component in the ulx spectra , by its passage through a clumpy wind @xcite ; the softness of the spectra support this by implying that our line - of - sight must at least graze the wind .",
    "however , @xcite note that the timing properties of the soft component in ssulxs are different from those seen in soft ul sources and suggest that the accretion rate may play a more important role than the viewing angle .",

    "stellar black holes may also increase their mass via accretion or mergers .",
    "the low mass end of the smbh distribution is an area of active research and extends at least as low as @xmath225 @xcite .",

    "the high end of the imbh range is sometimes taken to overlap with the low end of the smbh range , but here we keep the two classes distinct and consider only objects thought to be accreting from a companion star rather than the interstellar medium .",
    "the discovery of an imbh that is not a low - mass smbh while well above the maximum possible stellar black hole mass would require a novel mechanism for its formation . such objects may have been important in the formation of smbhs ( _ cf_. * ? ? ?",

    "there is a break in the xlf of star - forming galaxies at ( 12)@xmath227 ( section  [ sec : xlf ] ) .",
    "objects at higher luminosities , hlxs , appear to be a separate class @xcite .",

    "contamination by foreground stars and background agn is severe for hlx catalogs , reaching @xmath1370% @xcite ; optical observations are needed to remove interlopers ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "eso 243 - 49 hlx-1 has an extremely high luminosity , peaked above @xmath8 and is well removed from the nucleus of the host galaxy eso 243 - 49 @xcite .",
    "the source makes transitions from the hard state to the thermal state , as seen in gbhbs .",

    "they also confirmed the @xmath238 power relation between disk luminosity and temperature .",
    "@xcite applied a fully relativistic slim disk model and constrained the mass to be between 6,000 and 200,000  @xmath3 ; the wide range is due to the unknown spin .",

    "m82 x-1 exhibits a peak luminosity close to @xmath241  erg  s@xmath242 and is another promising imbh candidate on the basis of two pieces of evidence .",
    "one is the detection of a pair of hf - qpos as discussed in section  [ sec : timing ] . the high coherence and 3:2 frequency ratio measured with 2% accuracy of these qpos is strong evidence in favor of interpreting them as hf - qpos from a black hole with a mass of @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "the other evidence comes from correlated spectral and low frequency timing variability . in 2008/2009",

    "the latter range is shifted lower than , but overlaps with , that from @xcite and that derived from the hf - qpos .",
    "m82 x-1 lies near the super star cluster mgg 11 .",
    "a possible mechanism for the formation of imbhs is stellar collisions in the cores of dense stellar clusters .",
    "@xcite found that the extremely compact size of mgg 11 , its half light radius is only 1.2  pc , causes massive stars to rapidly sink to the cluster center via dynamical friction and makes the cluster a good candidate for the production of an imbh .",
    "@xcite examined 8 hlxs in _ xmm - newton _ data and found that their spectra are well modeled by an absorbed power - law with @xmath248 , which is harder than typical ulxs .",
    "some show evidence for strong variability , with rms of 1020% on timescales of 0.22 ks .",
    "these properties are consistent with the hard state , suggesting that the sources are sub - eddington and that their high luminosities indicate high black hole masses .",
    "one notable object in the sample is ngc 2276 - 3c from which @xcite reported a compact jet , described in section  [ sec : compactradio ] .",
    "if confirmed , the radio jet would verify that the hlx is in the hard state and establish it as an imbh .",
    "it is now thought that the supermassive black holes we see in most galactic nuclei have grown over time from seed black holes , created when the universe was only a small fraction of its current age , via accretion and mergers .",
    "the mass and creation mechanisms for these seeds are the subject of much debate , with possible seed masses ranging from large stellar mass black holes , @xmath249 , to the top end of the imbh regime , @xmath250 @xcite .",
    "however , the presence of qsos containing very massive black holes at high redshifts ( e.g. @xmath251 at @xmath252 , a mere 0.78 gyr after the big bang , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) means that the growth of the seeds can not be eddington - limited ; the only way to get such massive objects that early in cosmic history is through super - eddington accretion .",
    "it is also becoming apparent that there are some super - eddington agn in the local universe , commonly found amongst those agn classified as narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( e.g. rx j1140.1 + 307 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "super - eddington accretion is therefore not solely the domain of stellar - mass objects .",
    "the physics of super - eddington accretion onto supermassive black holes is thought to broadly resemble that seen in ulxs , with one important caveat : the accretion is generally from an ism , rather than a dense gravitationally - bound object such as a star .",
    "this means that the accretion flow is more susceptible to being impeded by the radiation and/or mechanical pressure released in accretion .",
    "for example , @xcite show that the large - scale inflow towards a super - eddington agn is only stable for luminosities below a certain threshold ; above this , the inflow becomes strongly episodic .",
    "the physics of the accretion disk itself is very similar to ulxs , with recent modeling showing that slim disk solutions permit the growth rates to increase significantly above that expected from eddington - limited accretion during short ( 10 kyr - 10 myr ) , heavily - obscured accretion episodes @xcite .",
    "such episodes should also drive strong outflows , as in ulxs , that should provide mechanical feedback that contributes to limiting the accretion and so affects the black hole / galaxy spheroid mass relations we see at the current epoch .",
    "@xcite calculate the strength of this wind for hyper - eddington accretion ( accretion rates @xmath253 times eddington ) , and note that this would lead to significantly smaller black holes than are seen in bulges today as material is swept away and not accreted ; hyper - eddington accretion must therefore be very rare in agn , with their super - eddington epochs limited to luminosities close to eddington .",
    "x - ray binaries likely dominated the x - ray emission in the early universe and contributed to the heating of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) during the epoch of reionization when the igm changed from being cold and neutral to being warm and ionized @xcite .",
    "detection of x - ray binaries in the early universe is not currently possible .",
    "one observational avenue to derive the properties of early x - ray binaries is the study of local analogs to high redshift galaxies .",
    "the early universe was highly metal deficient , even at @xmath254 the average metallicity is @xmath255 @xcite .",
    "metallicity appears to have a strong impact on the formation and properties of x - ray binaries , particularly in the high luminosity range , hence study of ulxs is important to inform our understanding of the early universe .",
    "studies of x - ray binaries and ulxs in star - forming galaxies show that their production , relative to the star formation rate ( sfr ) , is enhanced at sub - solar metallicities @xcite .",
    "these trends are enhanced at very low metalliticies , @xmath16 , with an increase , relative to near - solar - metallicity galaxies , of a factor of @xmath14 in the number of ulxs @xcite and @xmath15 in the total galactic x - ray luminosity @xcite .",
    "hence x - ray binary production was likely enhanced in the early universe .",
    "@xcite suggested a ` fundamental plane ' relation linking the total x - ray luminosity of a galaxy to its star formation rate and metallicity with a scatter of 0.25  dex that has been used in simulations of heating by x - ray binaries in the early universe @xcite . because the total luminosity is dominated by ulxs , the ulx spectral shape determines the penetration of the x - rays into the igm and , thus , the morphology of x - ray heating having implications for the detection of 21-cm hydrogen hyperfine radiation from the epoch of reionization @xcite .",
    "population synthesis calculations of binary formation and evolution also show enhanced x - ray emission and suggest physical causes .",
    "the decreased mass transfer due to radiative - driven winds from the companion stars increases the number of binary systems evolving into roche - lobe overflow systems @xcite .",
    "the decreased mass loss increases the maximum mass of black holes formed at the end of stellar evolution , reaching as high as @xmath256 for @xmath257 versus @xmath258 for @xmath259 @xcite .",
    "lyman @xmath135 and lyman continuum radiation from massive stars , that are copiously produced in starburst regions in early galaxies , is thought to have powered reionization of the igm .",
    "however , the fraction of the radiation that escapes from galaxies is low because lyman continuum and line emission is absorbed by dust and ly@xmath135 is resonantly scattered by neutral hydrogen .",
    "some source of feedback is required to blow neutral gas and dust away from the starburst to allow the lyman emission to escape ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as summarized in section  [ sec",
    ": supereddevidence ] , there is strong evidence for powerful outflows from ulxs .",
    "@xcite identified two candidate ulxs in haro 11 , one of the few confirmed lyman continuum emitting galaxies in local universe .",
    "they suggested that outflows from the ulxs blow neutral material away from the starburst regions where the ulxs are located , allowing the lyman radiation produced by the massive stars in the starburst to escape .",
    "if the correlation between ulxs and lyman continuum emitting galaxies is confirmed with a larger sample , this may indicate that ulxs had an important role in the reionization of the igm .      the first gravitational wave event ( gw150914 ) discovered by the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo )",
    "was produced by a pair of black holes with masses of @xmath260 and @xmath261 @xcite . these are larger than any known stellar black hole in the milky way @xcite , but within the range suggested for some ulxs and theoretically predicted to be produced in low metallicity environments .",
    "@xcite performed population synthesis simulations that suggest that the binary progenitor of gw150914 was formed in an environment with a metallicity less than 10% .",
    "a possible binary evolution leading to the observed merger begins with massive stars ( @xmath262 and @xmath263 @xmath3 ) that evolve through a common envelope phase into an x - ray binary consisting of a he star and a @xmath264 black hole .",
    "ulx binaries are formed through similar channels and offer a means to test the simulations , potentially helping to determine whether binary evolution or dynamical interactions in clusters is the dominant production mode for gravitational wave event progenitors .",
