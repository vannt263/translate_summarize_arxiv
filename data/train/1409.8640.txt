    "by transforming the general ef equation into an autonomous two - dimensional ode system one can classify the solutions based on linear stability analysis . this mapping can be achieved by using the transformations given by jordan and smith in @xcite @xmath62 with @xmath63 will turn ( [ efnormal ] ) into an autonomous two - dimensional ode system @xmath64 where @xmath65 and with the four equilibrium points given by @xmath66    following standard methods of phase - plane analysis , we use the linear approximation of the equilibrium points to classify them . the jacobian matrix of ( [ l2 ] ) is    @xmath67=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc } -1 - 2x+\\alpha y & \\alpha x\\\\",

    "as we can see from the table  [ tab1 ] the location in the phase space depends on the nonlinear coefficient @xmath73 and the powers @xmath74 , while the type of fixed point ( its classification ) is given only by the powers @xmath74 .    in order to have purely periodic solutions a center",

    "therefore the curve @xmath75 is given exactly by the rosenau first integrability condition @xmath39 which is a _ necessary _ condition for periodic solutions .",

    "therefore , now the second rosenau integrability condition is satisfied and one can use the parametric system ( [ equ6 ] ) with @xmath42 to generate solutions of the pseudo - oscillator equation , including solution ( [ gen ] ) .",
    "since now we have a center we can also write the invariant @xmath106 as in the previous case we are able to solve the invariant eq .",

    "following the same idea of nonlinear superposition , we obtain an obvious particular solution to ( [ get ] ) @xmath119{\\frac 3 2 ( 1+s)^4}~.\\ ] ]              using the phase - plane analysis of the counterpart autonomous two - dimensional ode system for the emden - fowler equations of the type ( [ ef ] ) , we have proved that these equations have small amplitude smooth periodic solutions when the trajectories lie in a neighborhood of the equilibrium @xmath124 provided that the rosenau integrability condition is satisfied , i.e. , @xmath39 , and @xmath125 .",
    "this is obtained from the condition of having at least one center in the set of fixed points , which is equivalent to the nullity of the trace of the jacobian matrix , a condition which comes out to be identical to the rosenau first integrability condition , whereas the sufficiency implying @xmath125 is obtained from the determinant of the jacobian matrix .",
    "thus , we conclude that @xmath126 has periodic solutions only when @xmath127 .",

    "any ef equation of type ( [ efw ] ) becomes @xmath131 when the first rosenau condition @xmath28 is satisfied it generates the same equation @xmath132 while the partner equation obtained using first integrability condition @xmath29 leads to its partner equation @xmath133 thus , one can get solutions of ( [ efw ] ) from solutions of ( [ efwq ] ) and vice versa , and can generate periodic solutions of ( [ efw ] ) by varying @xmath48 in ( [ efwr ] ) .    for both integrability conditions we found the invariant ( [ 100 ] )",
    "when @xmath39 and ( [ 1005 ] ) when @xmath29 respectively . in both cases ,",
