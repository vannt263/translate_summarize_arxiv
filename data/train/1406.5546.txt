    "quantum statistical effects dominate when the de broglie wave length is comparable to or larger than the average interparticle spacing .",
    "when the de broglie wave length is small , the particle statistics plays a negligible role and the system dynamics is governed by boltzmann statistics . since the de broglie wave length scales as @xmath0  @xcite , where @xmath1 is the temperature , changing the temperature allows one to turn the particle statistics `` on '' and `` off '' .",
    "atomic gases , which can be cooled to below the quantum degeneracy temperature , thus provide an ideal platform for investigating the importance of particle statistics .    for macroscopic samples ,",
    "a prominent example for a thermal phase transition is the transition from the normal to the superfluid phase as observed in bosonic liquid @xmath2he and fermionic liquid @xmath3he  @xcite .",
    "bose - einstein condensation , the macroscopic occupation of a single particle state , is another important example . while bose - einstein condensation occurs for ultracold bosonic atomic gases  @xcite , it does not occur , at least not directly , for ultracold fermionic atomic gases  @xcite .",

    "these fundamental differences , which are due to the particle statistics , continue to play an important role at low temperature but die out at sufficiently high temperature . an interesting question , which we attempt to answer in this paper , is thus what happens at intermediate temperatures .",

    "a key ingredient of the above analysis is that the fall off of the superfluid fraction is due to the center of mass excitations .",
    "this suggests an alternative viewpoint that defines the superfluid fraction with respect to the relative degrees of freedom only . if we replace the @xmath82-component @xmath84 of the total orbital angular momentum operator in eq .",
    "( [ eq_quantummomentofinertia ] ) by the @xmath82-component of the relative orbital angular momentum operator and modify the definition of the classical moment of inertia accordingly , then we find that the fall off of the superfluid fraction is correlated with the transition temperature .",
    "the spirit of the latter approach underlies the arguments of ref .",
    "@xcite , which considers a bose gas with @xmath261 and refers to the phase governed by the @xmath5-droplet state as superfluid phase .",
    "we emphasize , however , that ref .",
    "@xcite did not perform any quantitative calculations of the superfluid fraction or superfluid properties of the system . instead , ref .",
    "@xcite put forward qualitative arguments based on the exchange paths .",
    "we reiterate that the combined model breaks down when @xmath243 is not much larger than @xmath216 , i.e. , when the size of the trimer approaches the harmonic oscillator length . in this case",
    ", the lowest efimov trimer does not define a separate energy scale and the phase transition like feature discussed in this work disappears .",
    "qualitatively , we expect that the bose gas with @xmath292 changes from having a significant superfluid fraction to a small superfluid fraction as the temperature increases from zero to a few times @xmath216 . the @xmath261 case has been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this section considers a single - component gas consisting of @xmath167 particles with an impurity .",
    "we assume that the impurity interacts with the @xmath167 `` background '' atoms through the gaussian potential @xmath118 with diverging @xmath4-wave scattering length @xmath95 .",
    "the background atoms do not interact with each other .",
    "our goal is to investigate the temperature - dependence of the system properties as the statistics of the @xmath167 background atoms changes from bose to boltzmann to fermi statistics .",
    "as before , we consider equal mass systems .",
    "efimov trimers do not exist for two identical fermions and a third distinguishable particle ( in our case , the impurity )  @xcite .",
    "for two identical bosons and a third particle or two boltzmann particles ( i.e. , two distinguishable particles ) and a third particle , however , efimov trimers can exist  @xcite .",
    "an interesting question is thus how the finite temperature properties of the @xmath162 system with @xmath293 depend on the statistics .    from the discussion in the previous subsection it is clear that the properties of the trimer at low temperature determine the characteristics of larger bose systems provided @xmath262 is much larger than @xmath216 .",
    "throughout this section , we consider the situation where the lowest energy eigen state of the @xmath294 system with bose statistics has an energy comparable to @xmath216 , i.e. , @xmath295 [ note , the lowest energy eigen state of the @xmath294 system with boltzmann statistics has the same energy ] .",
    "for the same model interactions , the lowest energy eigen state of the @xmath294 system with fermi statistics also has an energy comparable to @xmath216 ; the energy for the system with fermi statistics is , however , larger than that for the system with bose statistics .",
    "we will show that the low temperature properties of the @xmath162 systems display , as might be expected naively , statistics dependent characteristics for temperatures around or below @xmath216 .",

    "[ 31statistics](a ) , the pair distribution functions for the systems with boltzmann and bose statistics are nearly indistinguishable and notably different from the pair distribution function for the system with fermi statistics .",
    "this can be explained as follows .",
    "the systems with bose and boltzmann statistics have the same ground state energy while the system with fermi statistics has a notably larger ground state energy . due to the absence of bound trimer states for the system with fermi statistics for vanishing confinement ( i.e. , for @xmath320 ) ,",
    "the pair distribution function is fully determined by the trap length and the temperature  @xcite . for the systems with bose and boltzmann statistics ,",
    "the pair distribution function takes on large values at small @xmath233 , reflecting the fact that these systems form a droplet like state for vanishing confinement .",

    "the energy , heat capacity , hyperradial distribution function , and superfluid fraction were monitored as a function of the temperature .",

    "we established that the statistics can be treated perturbatively at high temperature .    in the future",
    ", it will be interesting to extend the few - body studies presented here to larger number of particles . for bosons",
    ", this should be fairly straightforward . for fermions , however , the sign problem will place constraints on the temperature regime that can be covered .",
    "an important question is if the @xmath5-boson droplet state discussed here can be probed experimentally .",
