    "@xcite and @xcite noticed that the galaxy gives rise to a dla system in the spectrum of the qso .",
    "@xcite studied sbs  1543 + 593 using hst imaging and ground based spectroscopy",
    ". they classified it an sm dwarf galaxy with properties that are entirely in line with those of other local dwarf galaxies .",
    "several of 33 hst - discovered hii regions were analyzed with emission - line diagnostics . for the brightest region ( # 5 ) all emission lines necessary to derive the o and n abundances were detected .",
    "sbs  1543 + 593 offers an excellent opportunity to directly compare element abundances inferred from cool interstellar gas ( dlas ) and ionized gas ( sfgs ) .",
    "none of the previously imaged dla galaxies resolves to show individual hii regions . in none of them , does the sightline to the qso intercept the disk of the galaxy well within its optical radius , let alone , close to its center , thus eliminating concerns over metallicity gradients .",
    "sbs  1543 + 593 facilitates an important inquiry into the behavior of galaxy metallicities with redshift , because almost all available abundances at high redshifts are determined from qso absorption line studies and refer to iron - peak elements such as zn and cr @xcite , whereas at low redshifts , derivations of chemical abundances are based on nebular emission - line studies in star - forming regions , and are primarily , based on the alpha - capture element oxygen ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite recently derived o abundances from emission - lines in one dla and one sub - dla galaxy ; the qsos spectra allowed them to determine absorption - line abundances of fe .",
    "these data are not suited to the comparison we are interested in here , because fe is a highly depleted element ; we do not know the @xmath0/fe ratio ; and their qsos have impact parameters larger than the optical disks of the galaxies .",
    "sbs  1543 + 593 is unique , since it enables a direct comparison between the emission- and absorption - line techniques , and allows alpha element abundances of a dla and its host galaxy to be contrasted in a low - redshift qso - galaxy pair .",
    "two sets of hst / stis observations of the qso hs  1543 + 5921 were performed ( i d 9784 , pi bowen ) using grating g140 m with a dispersion of 0.05 / pix and centered on 1222.0  and on 1272.0 .",

    "we find that the metallicities in the ionized and neutral gas agree within the errors .",
