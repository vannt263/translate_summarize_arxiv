    "<S> the transport properties of neutron star matter play an important role in many astrophysical processes . </S>",
    "<S> we report the results of a calculation of the shear viscosity and thermal conductivity coefficients of the hard - sphere fermion system of degeneracy @xmath0=2 , that can be regarded as a model of pure neutron matter . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is based on the effective interaction obtained from the formalism of correlated basis functions and the cluster expansion technique . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting transport coefficients show a strong sensitivity to the quasiparticle effective mass , reflecting the effect of second order contributions to the self - energy that are not taken into account in nuclear matter studies available in the literature . </S>"
