    "particle detection in liquid scintillators benefits of a powerful technique to discriminate among interacting particles : the light pulse shape discrimination ( psd ) , a key feature to extract the searched signal from the background .",
    "+ the psd relies on the different time profiles of the scintillation photon emission , dependent on the energy loss and hence on the kind of ionizing particle crossing the media .",
    "this technique is particularly effective in discriminating light particles , as electrons and positrons , from heavy particles , like protons , ions and alpha particles ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . however , such technique is inadequate to distinguish between electrons and positrons .",
    "recently , a new psd technique @xcite has been proposed to separate electrons from positrons .",
    "the latter , in fact , may be identified by exploiting the formation of a metastable electron ",
    "positron bound state ( positronium ) , a competitive process with respect to direct annihilation .",
    "the positron  induced pulse shape in liquid scintillators is indeed the sum of two components : the positron ionization and the positronium decay @xmath0 s .",
    "the latter is delayed by the positronium mean lifetime .",
    "+ positronium exists in two states : the singlet , called para  positronium ( p - ps ) , which decays into two @xmath0 s with a lifetime in vacuum of 125  ps , and the triplet , or ortho  positronium ( o - ps ) , which decays into three @xmath0 s with a lifetime of 142  ns .",
    "triplet and singlet states are formed in a ratio of 3:1 .",
    "+ in the case of p - ps , the delay between the ionization and the annihilation @xmath0 s is negligible with respect to the characteristic detection times .",
    "+ in matter , o - ps is subjected to chemical reactions ( oxidation or compound formation ) , magnetic effects ( spin  flip ) , and interactions with the surrounding electrons ( pick  off , the dominant effect in liquid scintillator in absence of electric and magnetic fields ) .",
    "these interactions yield a two body decay  @xcite and cause a sizable shortening of the o - ps lifetime to a few nanoseconds  @xcite .",
    "+ nevertheless , even such an o - ps mean lifetime may induce an observable distortion in the photon emission time distribution .    the signature provided by the o - ps  induced pulse shape distortion",
    "has already been successfully exploited by the borexino collaboration @xcite in the identification and rejection of the cosmogenic @xmath1c @xmath2 decays , the dominant background in the solar _ pep _ neutrino rate measurement .",
    "+ more in general , cosmic muon interactions in organic liquid scintillators produce several other sources of @xmath2 decays , such as @xmath3b , @xmath4be , and @xmath5c @xcite , which represent critical contaminations in underground low - background neutrino experiments , such as borexino  @xcite and sno+  @xcite .",
    "+ furthermore , the o - ps  enhanced psd may strengthen the electron anti ",
    "neutrino detection , usually performed via the inverse beta decay process : @xmath6 .",
    "the positron identification , in addition to the positron  neutron delayed coincidence , can abate the rate of random coincidences and correlated electron ",
    "neutron background , such as the cosmogenic @xmath4li and @xmath3he decays .",
    "this technique can be applied in reactor neutrino experiments , like double chooz  @xcite , daya bay  @xcite and reno  @xcite .",
    "the o - ps properties ( lifetime and formation probability ) have already been measured in the solvents for organic liquid scintillators commonly used in neutrino physics ( pseudocumene ( pc ) , linear alkylbenzene ( lab ) , phenylxylylethane ( pxe ) , and dodecane ) and in scintillator mixtures , based on pseudocumene and 2,5-diphenyloxazole ( ppo ) with or without isoparaffin @xcite . + recent progress in chemistry allows to obtain stable scintillators loaded with organo - metallic compounds .",
    "elements like gadolinium and lithium are employed to enhance neutron detection , thanks to their large cross section . in particular , gadolinium is commonly used to improve the signature in reactor anti  neutrino experiments , whereas lithium is particularly useful in neutron detection due to charged particle production after capture ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . both metal - doped scintillators could also be used as a veto for low background experiments such as direct dark matter search ones .",
    "+ scintillators can also be loaded directly with the signal source , like in the case of sno+ , where the double beta emitter , originally @xmath7nd , and very recently replaced by @xmath8te  @xcite , is mixed with the active mass .    in this work",
    ", we measured the effects of the gadolinium , neodymium , lithium and tellurium compounds on the positronium properties in liquid scintillator , as a function of their concentrations .",
    "a standard pals system made of two plastic scintillators ( pilot u ) detectors was used to measure the o - ps formation fraction and its lifetime .",
    "a detailed description of the apparatus can be found in ref .",
    "the @xmath9na positron source , deposited between two kapton@xmath10 ( dupont ) layers 15  @xmath11 m thick , is immersed in the vial containing scintillator to be tested .",
    "the first plastic scintillator is configured ( lower energy threshold at 900  kev ) to produce a trigger signal detecting the 1.27  mev @xmath0 emitted in the @xmath9na decay along with a positron .",
    "the other detector ( 350 to 500  kev energy range ) generates a second signal when a 511 kev from the positron annihilation is revealed . the difference in time between the two signals",
    "is measured to reconstruct the o - ps lifetime .",
    "a typical observed spectrum can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] .",
    "the fit is performed using the roofit package  @xcite based on minuit .",
    "the fit function is a combination of three exponentials and a constant term : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( i = 1 , 2 ) correspond to the effective amplitude and lifetime of direct annihilation and p - ps ; a@xmath15 and @xmath16 refer instead to o - ps .",
    "the constant term @xmath17 accounts for the accidental background .",
    "the use of two exponentials for the description of direct annihilation and p - ps is a standard practice in positron annihilation spectroscopy , and depends on the fact that the positron thermalization lifetime is different in the source support ( kapton in our case ) and in the medium to be tested ( liquid scintillator ) .",
    "the fit function @xmath18 is convoluted with a gaussian distribution to model the detector resolution ( @xmath19  120  ps ) .",
    "the o - ps properties are extracted from the fit result .",
    "the fit parameter @xmath16 is a direct measurement of the o - ps lifetime .",
    "it consists in an effective value resulting from the two and three gamma decay modes , whose fractions are respectively : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the vacuum o - ps lifetime of 142  ns .",
    "the evaluation of the o - ps probability formation ( @xmath22 ) is less straightforward . assuming a different detection efficiency for the two ( @xmath23 ) and three gamma ( @xmath24 ) decays , the number of annihilation ( @xmath25 ) and o - ps formation ( @xmath26 ) measured are : @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the number of annihilations measured in the kapton and @xmath30 the total number of events in the scintillator volume .",
    "+ the fraction of annihilations in kapton , @xmath29 , was extrapolated from measurements at various kapton layer thicknesses and found to be @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "+ solving the system of eq .",
    "[ eq : a1 ] and [ eq : a2 ] , the o - ps probability formation is found to be : @xmath32    as it can be seen in eq .",
    "[ eq : f ] , the evaluation of the o - ps formation probability relies on the knowledge of the ratio of the detection efficiencies for the three and two gamma channels .",
    "+ since this value could not be measured with high precision in the experiment , the o - ps formation fraction was computed in the two extreme cases @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the average of the two obtained values was taken as measure of @xmath22 , while the difference was taken as contribution to the systematic error ( 1.2% ) .",
    "furthermore , another component of the systematic error was estimated looking at the discrepancies between the measurements of the same sample ( each one was measured three times ) : this resulted in an error of about 1.3% .",
    "+ the error budget on the o - ps formation fraction includes also a statistical component , given by the error propagation in eq .  [ eq : f ] , which is typically of the order of 0.6% .",
    "the same was done for the lifetime evaluation where an error of about 0.9% ( corresponding to @xmath35  ns ) was found . moreover ,",
    "an error of 0.3% on the time coming from the setup calibration procedure is included .    to summarize , adding each error contribution quadratically the error on the o - ps formation fraction obtained is @xmath36 whereas @xmath37 error is obtained on its lifetime .",
    "the gd doped sample is a lab based scintillator mixed with 3  g / l of ppo , 15  mg /",
    "l of 1,4-bis(2-methylstyryl)benzene ( bis  msb ) and gd at a concentration varying from 0.01% to 0.45% .",
    "+ the obtained scintillator , under minor modifications , is the one typically used in reactor antineutrino experiments , such as daya bay  @xcite and reno  @xcite .    as it can be seen in tab .",
    "[ tab : resgd ] , the o - ps formation fraction decreases as the gd concentration increases , whereas the lifetime is almost constant .",
    "it can be noted that when a very small fraction of doper is added ( 0.01% ) the formation fraction increases slightly with respect to the case of pure lab : this is a known effect as explained in ref  @xcite .",
    ".results for the o - ps formation fraction and mean lifetime in gd doped lab samples . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the trends of the o - ps lifetime and formation fraction as a function of the te and water concentrations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : timete ] and [ fig : fracte ] respectively .",
    "the o - ps formation fraction and lifetime were measured in different doped liquid scintillators .",
    "in particular we studied the dependence of the o - ps properties as a function of the doper concentration , using gadolinium , neodymium , lithium and tellurium as dopers .",
    "as first result , we observed that the o - ps lifetime is constant and unaffected by the doper . +",
    "the formation fraction is instead sensitive to the presence of a metal in the lab and it typically decreases as the doper concentration increases .",
    "this behavior is particularly evident for the gd and nd loaded scintillators .",
    "+ scintillators loaded with li and te have a slightly different behavior due to the different loading procedure which results in the presence of water and a surfactant in the final sample .",
    "we found that both the presence of the doper and of the water have an almost negligible impact with respect to the surfactant one .    in conclusion",
    ", the o - ps pulse shape discrimination can be exploited in both anti  neutrino and neutrino  less double beta decay experiments , to enhance the anti - neutrino signal or to reject positron like background , respectively . however , if in the first class of experiments , high concentrations of high neutron cross section dopers can reduce by up to @xmath3825% the o - ps formation , the double beta emitters must be embedded in molecules containing surfactants , which suppress by up to @xmath3840% the o - ps component with respect to the undoped scintillator mixtures .",
