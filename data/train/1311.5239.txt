    "gallium nitride growth by metal organic chemical vapor deposition ( mocvd ) and hydride vapor phase epitaxy ( hvpe ) is carried out using ammonia ( nh@xmath0 ) as source of active nitrogen . despite implementation of these methods on a massive scale , some aspects of its still remain unclear and detailed understanding of these processes needs additional investigations",
    ". therefore thorough description of the atomic scale composition , the structure and the processes at gan(0001 ) surface is essential for understanding , controlling and manipulation of the ammonia based growth of the nitride crystals and layers .",
    "previously , first principles calculations , used to obtain gan surface phase diagrams showed that the thermodynamically stable structures obey @xmath2 symmetry and are compliant with the _ electron counting rule _",

    "in simple terms , this rule is satisfied if all electrons can be accommodated in surface bonds in such a way that the valence band ( vb ) and conduction band ( cb ) states are filled and empty , respectively @xcite .",
    "recently , walkosz _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that inn(0001 ) surface under nh@xmath0 exposure does not obey ecr .    in the present work we will apply recently obtained results showing that the adsorption energy depends on the electronic charge transfer during process at the semiconductor surface @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the difference of the fermi energy between the semiconductor and the surface adsorbed species leads to the charge transfer if the free states are available @xcite .",
    "the energy contribution depends on the states involved in the electron transfer , effectively these are the states close to the fermi energy and the surface states emerging due to adsorption . in the case",
    "when the fermi level is not pinned at the surface , the adsorption energy depends on the fermi level in the bulk i.e. doping @xcite while in the case of the fermi level pinned , the energy is different for the different pinning states , i.e. the coverage @xcite . the effect could change the adsorption energy by several electronvolts , as shown for ammonia adsorption at partially hydrogen covered gan(0001 ) surface .",
    "the present study discuss the processes involving hydrogen at nh@xmath0/nh@xmath1 covered gan(0001 ) surface is inadvertently at variance with the earlier studies where such dependence was neither identified nor modeled .",
    "the incompatibility of the present and the earlier results is additionally related to the use of an insufficient size of the simulated systems previously , usually based on @xmath2 supercells , which were not able to reproduce some configurations of the surface .",
    "therefore , in our study we focus on systems larger than those previously published .",
    "we report the results for the most stable gan(0001 ) surface configurations in ammonia - rich conditions i.e. covered with nh@xmath0 and nh@xmath1 mixture , obtained employing @xmath3 supercells . in the analysis of these states the thermodynamic and mechanical stability criteria",
    "are defined and compared .",
    "the thermodynamic approach was then used to determine the nh@xmath1/nh@xmath0 coverage in function of partial pressure of molecular hydrogen .",
    "the consequences of the present result to general understanding of the growth and doping of semiconductor crystals are discussed in detail .",
    "all calculations described in this paper were performed using density functional theory ( dft ) within gga approximation and wu - cohen exchange - correlation potential @xcite employing siesta code @xcite , employing numerical atomic orbitals and pseudopotential method .",
    "the ions were described by troullier - martins pseudopotentials and nonlinear core corrections ( nlcc ) were included for the ga species which had @xmath4 electrons explicitly included as valence states .",
    "the basic functions were specifically optimized with the simplex method and have the following implementation : n@xmath5 dz , ga@xmath5 dzp , n@xmath6 tzp , ga@xmath6 tzp ( 3d  dz ) , h  qzp .     slab representing the gan(0001 ) surface covered with mixture of nh@xmath0 and nh@xmath1 admolecules.,width=4 ]    in order to represent the semi - infinite gan(0001 ) surface a supercell approach was used with periodically repeated slabs consisting of eight double layers of gan with lateral size of @xmath3 units cell , such as the geometry shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : slab ] .",
    "the vacuum regions of about 47   were used to isolate slab replicas .",
    "the lower artificial surface of the slab is passivated by pseudo - hydrogen atoms of the fractional atomic number equal to either 0.75 or 0.735 .",
    "the impact of changes of the slab termination is described in detail in ref .",
    "the three topmost layers of atoms are fully relaxed and the all others are relaxed in @xmath7-direction and fixed at the ideal positions of the lattice @xmath8 .",
    "the optimization of geometry was performed until the forces acting on the mobile atoms are smaller than 0.04 ev/. due to the large size of a simulated system ( @xmath3 slab containing more than 320 atoms ) only one @xmath9-point sampling in @xmath10 point of first bz was used during the relaxation of the atomic positions .",
    "then for the final optimized configurations , the total energies were calculated using @xmath11 monkhorst - pack kgrid .",
    "the equivalent plane wave cutoff for the grid was set to 275 ry .",
    "the calculated lattice parameters of gan are @xmath12   and @xmath13   in decent agreement with commonly known experimental values : @xmath14   and @xmath15   @xcite .",
    "in principle the energy calculations determine mechanical stability of the continuum of the possible microstates . effectively , any mechanical stability criterion may be applied to the energy extrema only . as it is expected , the energy maxima disintegrate instantaneously , thus the energy minima are the only physically relevant states .",
    "mechanical stability is an important class of the stability criteria as it determines whether the considered state ( extremum ) may survive for a long time .",
    "the mechanical stability is usually determined by the energy landscape connecting the two or more energy minima .",
    "the one of the lowest energy is the mechanically stable thus it may persist for indefinitely long time , at least in low thermal agitation",
    ".    the higher energy state ( extremum ) may be metastable in the case of existing energy barrier ( then it is a minimum ) or unstable in the case when the energy barrier does not exists and the state is attained in the asymptotic sense ( effectively it is a neutral energy point ) .",
    "the latter case may by encountered in the desorption processes .",
    "thus the metastable state may survive for a finite time whereas the unstable one disintegrates instantaneously .",
    "therefore the metastable states may be prepared in some , sometimes non - equilibrium conditions to be accessible for investigations .",
    "the existence period of such state is determined by the heights of the energy barriers and the thermal agitation of the system .",
    "naturally , the mechanically metastable state may last forever under appropriate thermodynamic stimulus compensating the escape from the metastable state by the reverse , thermodynamically enforced process . without this , under thermal agitation , the metastable or even fully stable state may be disintegrated . in the case of the desorption to infinite extent of the vapor",
    ", the process may lead to total escape from the surface .",
    "therefore , thermodynamic stability criteria , accounting presence of the compensating flux of the externally chemical potential level , are usually applied to the mechanically stable or metastable states .",
    "depending on these thermodynamic conditions , such surface states may be stabilized , attaining the equilibrium with the extent of infinite vapor or not .    in summary ,",
    "mechanical stability criterion determines the possibility of the existence of some surface states .",
    "the thermodynamic stability determines which states are achieved in equilibrium with the given chemical potential mass source . in the case of the surface states a physical realization of such sources requires specification of the temperature and the partial pressure of the surrounding vapor .",

    "therefore the surface content of ammonia is defined as number of nh@xmath0 molecules divided by total number of the nodes on the slab surface .",
    "due to high partial pressure of ammonia and high v / iii ratio , typically close to 4000 in movpe growth of gan layers , it is likely that all ga sites are covered either by ammonia admolecules or by nh@xmath1 radicals . in accordance to earlier publications @xcite in such dense coverage these molecules are located in the _ on - top _ positions , as shown in fig .",

    ", the maximal number of the surface sites is 16 , that are potentially covered by the equal summaric number of ammonia admolecules or nh@xmath1 radicals , thus the ammonia coverage can be sampled by 1/16 ml intervals in the range from  0 to 100% .",

    "the negative value of @xmath23 means that the configuration with the pair of hydrogen atoms attached to the surface have lower energy than that of the h@xmath1 molecule separated from the slab .",

    "it is worth to underline that the adsorption energy of hydrogen shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : h2 - 3x3x1 ] varies from the energy gain of about 5 ev / molecule to the energy loss of about 3 ev / molecule .",

    "the effect is striking as it is well known that ammonia undergoes thermal decomposition at high temperatures .",
    "therefore gainn layers are grown using nitrogen gas only , and at relatively low temperatures , not exceeding 1100  k , such that ammonia decomposition is negligible .",
    "it is expected that at the typical movpe growth arrangement , the decomposition of ammonia in the growth zone is low , so the vapor consist of nitrogen and ammonia with fairly low addition of molecular hydrogen .",
    "it is anticipated that the presence of molecular hydrogen may affect the incorporation of indium into the growing layers either by the change of the coverage of gan(0001 ) surface or by the influence on the steps kinetics .",
    "the first scenario may be assessed using the above described results .",
    "the principal factor is the thermodynamic stimulus for the adsorption of hydrogen , direct generalization of the supersaturation in standard crystal growth theory , i.e. thermodynamic potential difference between the hydrogen adsorbed at the surface and the chemical potential value of the atomic hydrogen in the vapor : @xmath24 - \\mu[gan(0001 ) + h]\\ ] ] or alternatively the pair of hydrogen atoms adsorbed at the surface and the hydrogen molecule @xmath25 in the vapor : @xmath26 - \\mu[gan(0001 ) + h_2]\\ ] ] the latter describes the physically relevant case of the molecular hydrogen vapor .",

    "these arguments may be summarized as follows :    * the adsorption energy of open shell system species depends on the electronic charge transfer at surfaces * for pinned fermi level surfaces it depends on the pinning state * for unpinned fermi level surfaces it depends on doping in the bulk * for majority semiconductor surfaces the fermi level is pinned * the growth proceeds by an increase of the density of adsorbed active species , depinning the fermi level * the equilibrium pressure of active species is exponentially dependent on the adsorption energy , thus for typical change of the coverage it changes by more than 10 orders of magnitude * the pressure change during typical growth process is not likely to be sufficient to attain the second pinning state , thus fermi level is unpinned during the process * the adsorption energy depends on the fermi level in the bulk , i.e. the doping that constitutes primary molecular mechanism explaining influence of the doping in the bulk on the vapor growth and the doping of semiconductors    the above points constitute terse description of the newly proposed scenario explaining basic features of the vapor growth and doping of the semiconductor crystals in general .",
    "the newly proposed dependence of the adsorption energy on the charge transfer at the surface was confirmed .",
    "it was shown that the adsorption energy of hydrogen at nh@xmath0/nh@xmath1 covered gan(0001 ) surface changes by several electronvolts depinning on the fermi level at the surface ( pinned ) and in the bulk ( unpinned ) .",
    "the two different stability conditions are analyzed : the newly defined mechanical and the well known thermodynamic . it is argued that the mechanical stability criterion defines unstable regions of the states that are not accessible in the standard experiments .",
    "the mechanically stable regions , i.e.  those potentially realized in the experiments are divided into meta- and fully stable parts .",
    "the meta and fully stable states may be realized and their existence depends on the thermodynamic state of the surrounding vapor .",
    "the thermodynamic stability is then invoked and analyzed for the gan(0001 ) surface covered by a mixture of nh@xmath0 molecules and nh@xmath1 radicals with respect to the exchange of hydrogen molecules from the gas phase .",
    "it has been shown that the surface becomes mechanically metastable with respect to the escape of h@xmath1 molecules at the ammonia content in the 3040% interval , depending on the doping in the bulk .",

    "analysis the chemical potential of hydrogen is translated into the thermodynamic control parameters of real processes : the temperature and the partial pressure of molecular hydrogen .",
    "it was shown that relatively small change of the content of ammonia admolecules is equivalent to the change of the partial pressures of molecular hydrogen by several orders of magnitude .",
    "thus the impact of hydrogen on the movpe gan growth is limited and hydrogen partial pressure may change the state of the surface only in the limited range of the coverage compositions .    the new general scenario of the growth of semiconductor crystal on the surface is presented in which the fermi level is unpinned during the process .",
    "this observation led to formulation of the novel molecular mechanism explaining the dependence of the growth and doping on the position of the fermi level in the bulk , i.e. doping in the bulk .",
    "the analysis of the electron density of states shows that gan(0001 ) surface under mixed nh@xmath0/nh@xmath1 coverage does not fulfill electron counting rule for the ammonia content different from 25% . at these state",

    "<S> _ ab initio _ calculations were performed to study the physical properties of gan(0001 ) surface in ammonia - rich conditions , i.e. covered by mixture of nh@xmath0 molecules and nh@xmath1 radicals . </S>",
    "<S> the fermi level is pinned at valence band maximum ( vbm ) and conduction band minimum ( cbm ) for full coverage by nh@xmath0 molecules and nh@xmath1 radicals , respectively . for the crossover </S>",
    "<S> content of ammonia of about 25% monolayer ( ml ) , the fermi level is unpinned . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that hydrogen adsorption energy depends on the doping in the bulk for the unpinned fermi level , i.e. for this coverage . </S>",
    "<S> surface structure thermodynamic and mechanical stability criteria are defined and compared . </S>",
    "<S> mechanical stability of the coverage of such surfaces was checked by determination of the desorption energy of hydrogen molecules . </S>",
    "<S> thermodynamic stability analysis indicates that initally equilibrium hydrogen vapor partial pressure steeply increases with nh@xmath0 content to attain the crossover nh@xmath0/nh@xmath1 coverage , i.e. the unpinned fermi level condition . for such condition </S>",
    "<S> the entire range of experimentally accessible pressures belongs showing that vapor growth of semiconductor crystals occurs predominantly for unpinned fermi level at the surface , i.e. for flat bands . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , adsorption energy of most species depends on the doping in the bulk that is basis of the possible molecular scenario explaining dependence of the growth and the doping of semiconductor crystals on the doping in the bulk .    </S>",
