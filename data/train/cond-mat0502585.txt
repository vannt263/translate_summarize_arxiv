    "in the last decade , the research group of professor marc ilegems at epfl has been working intensively and enthusiastically on the physics and device applications of artificial photonic systems , such as semiconductor microcavities and photonic crystals . in this _ festschrift _ paper , we are going to present a theory of some exotic physical properties of coherently excited semiconductor microstructures in the strong exciton - photon coupling regime .",
    "we hope that the rich phenomenology here described will contribute to a very pleasant celebration of his 65th birthday .",
    "the behavior of a quantum fluid has played an important role in many fields of condensed matter and atomic physics , ranging from superconductors to helium fluids  @xcite and , during the last decade , bose - einstein condensates of cold trapped atoms  @xcite .",
    "one of the most dramatic manifestations of macroscopic coherence of an interacting many - body system is superfluidity  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the predicted non - equilibrium propagation properties of a two - dimensional gas of polaritons in a semiconductor microcavity in the strong exciton - photon coupling regime @xcite . thanks to their photonic component",
    ", polaritons can be coherently excited by an applied laser field and detected through the emitted light .",
    "thanks to their excitonic component , polaritons have strong binary interactions , which have been shown to produce spectacular and rich polariton amplification effects through matter - wave stimulated collisions @xcite , as well as spontaneous parametric instabilities  @xcite .",
    "recently , a significant amount of research has been also focusing on the quantum optical properties of the polariton emission in the parametric regime with the possibility of observing polariton squeezing and polariton pair entanglement @xcite .    here",
    ", we are going to present a detailed discussion of the interplay between the peculiar polariton collective excitations and the rich variety of parametric instabilities , which occur in presence of a nearly - resonant continuous wave pump laser .",
    "in addition , we are going to discuss the impact on the propagation properties of a moving polariton fluid and analyze in detail the superfluid regime , which we predicted in a very recent letter @xcite .",
    "as our system is a strongly non - equilibrium one , the polariton field oscillation frequency is not fixed by any equation of state relating the chemical potential to the polariton density , but it can be tuned by the frequency of the exciting pump laser .",
    "this opens the possibility of having a collective excitation spectrum which has no counterpart in usual systems close to thermal equilibrium .",
    "in particular , we will analyze the propagation in presence of a static potential ( either for the photonic or exciton component ) , which is known to produce resonant rayleigh scattering ( rrs ) of the exciting laser field  @xcite .",
    "superfluidity of the polariton fluid manifests itself as a dramatic collapse of the resonant rayleigh scattering intensity when the flow velocity imprinted by the exciting laser beam is slower than the interaction - induced sound velocity in the polariton fluid .",
    "furthermore , a dramatic reshaping of the rrs pattern due to polariton - polariton interactions can be observed in both momentum and real space even at higher flow velocities , e.g. with the appearance of cherenkov - like patterns .",
    "we will present a rich set of predicted far - field and near - field images of the resonant rayleigh scattering emission .",
    "in order to describe a planar microcavity containing a quantum well with an excitonic resonance strongly coupled to a cavity mode , we will consider the following model hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath0\\,{\\hat\\psi}_{j } ( { { \\bf x}})\\\\ + \\frac{\\hbar g}{2}\\int\\ ! d { { \\bf x}}\\,{\\hat\\psi^\\dagger}_{x } ( { { \\bf x}})\\,{\\hat\\psi^\\dagger}_{x } ( { { \\bf x}})\\ , { \\hat\\psi}_{x } ( { { \\bf x}})\\,{\\hat\\psi}_{x } ( { { \\bf x}})+\\\\ + \\int\\!d { { \\bf x}}\\,\\hbar f_{p } ( { { \\bf x}},t ) \\,{\\hat\\psi^\\dagger}_{c } ( { { \\bf x}})+\\textrm{h.c.}~,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the in - plane spatial position and the field operators @xmath2 respectively describe excitons ( @xmath3 ) and cavity photons ( @xmath4 ) .",

    "note that , for simplicity , we will limit our treatment to the case of polariton modes with the same circular polarization , which can be excited by a circularly polarized pump .",

    "<S> we present a description of the non - equilibrium properties of a microcavity polariton fluid , injected by a nearly - resonant continuous wave pump laser . in the first part </S>",
    "<S> , we point out the interplay between the peculiar dispersion of the bogolubov - like polariton excitations and the onset of polariton parametric instabilities . </S>",
    "<S> we show how collective excitation spectra having no counterpart in equilibrium systems can be observed by tuning the excitation angle and frequency . in the second part , we explain the impact of these collective excitations on the in - plane propagation of the polariton fluid . we show that the resonant rayleigh scattering induced by artificial or natural defects is a very sensitive tool to show fascinating effects such as polariton superfluidity or polariton cherenkov effect . </S>",
    "<S> we present a comprehensive set of predicted far - field and near - field images for the resonant rayleigh scattering emission . </S>"
