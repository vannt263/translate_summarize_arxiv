    "a large class of phenomena in biology , chemistry , engineering and physics occurs via the transport of particles driven along periodic substrates by an external bias .",
    "these phenomena include polymer diffusion at interfaces  @xcite , motion of fluxons in superconductors containing a periodic arrangement of defects  @xcite , adsorption on crystal surfaces  @xcite , super - ionic conduction  @xcite , motion of molecular motors along microtubules  @xcite , granular flows on rough inclined substrates  @xcite or in a narrow pipe  @xcite .",
    "the study of transport properties of granular systems represents an open issue in statistical mechanics of considerable interest and difficulty in view of the continuous energy dissipation caused by particle inelastic interactions  @xcite . in this perspective",
    ", we consider a simple model consisting of a granular fluid moving on a tilted rough substrate , which may favor clustering and jamming behaviors .    in our formulation , a granular system is a large number of particles ( grains ) colliding with one another and losing a little energy in each collision  @xcite .",
    "if such a system is shaken to keep it in motion its dynamics resembles that of fluids as the grains move randomly .",
    "@xcite    we carry out a comparative study of the behavior of three models : the inelastic particle system ( ips ) , the elastic particle system ( eps ) , and finally the non interacting system or independent brownian particles ( ibp ) to understand how the interactions influence the collective transport .",
    "the absence of interactions between particles makes the basic phenomenology of the ibp well understood .",
    "it reduces , indeed , to the motion of a single particle in a force field resulting from the interplay between a constant force @xmath0 , such as gravity or electric field , a spatially periodic force , simulating the presence of a rough substrate , a viscous force accounting for the friction , and a noise term , representing thermal fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "the scenario is the following : particles diffuse with a bias in the direction of the steady force , @xmath0 , with an average velocity , @xmath1 , which is an increasing function of the applied load @xmath0 .",
    "however , when the load is below a critical value , @xmath2 , and the noise sufficiently small , the average velocity tends to zero . in other words",
    "the particles remain locked in the minima of the periodic potential . on the other hand , above the threshold , @xmath2",
    ", the particles may travel from one minimum to the other along the tilt direction .",
    "the critical value , @xmath2 , depends on roughness , friction and temperature . according to the value of the friction coefficient two different scenarios",
    "may be observed . in the so called overdamped limit",
    ", @xmath2 occurs only when the tilt is such that the local minima completely disappear . in the opposite limit , _",
    "i.e. _ , in the underdamped regime , the particles may overcome many barriers even for low values of @xmath0 at which the potential still displays local minima .",
    "in fact , the particles may cross a barrier , provided their gain in potential energy , to go from one minimum to the next , exceeds the energy dissipated along this pathway . in the underdamped limit the exact value of @xmath2 depends on the temperature .",
    "two indicators may serve to characterize the collective transport properties of the system , the mobility , @xmath3 , and the diffusion constant , @xmath4 .",
    "the former relates the average velocity to the tilt @xmath0 according to @xmath5 .",
    "the latter measures the average spreading of particles : @xmath6 ^ 2 \\rangle\\;. \\label{diffusion}\\ ] ] the average is meant over the thermal noise realizations . in all the cases where @xmath7 asymptotically grows linearly in time",
    ", we can identify the normal diffusion constant @xmath4 defined as the slope of the law @xmath8 that generally is computed numerically through simulations of the system evolution .",
    "the study of the dependence of @xmath3 and @xmath4 on @xmath0 and other system parameter is necessary to determine the efficiency of the transport , i.e. the ratio between drift and spreading of a swarm of particles .",
    "a detailed theory capable of describing the behavior of the ibp for arbitrary values of the damping has been developed by risken  @xcite who derived an analytical expression for the mobility , @xmath3 , as a function of noise level , tilting force and substrate characteristics .",
    "a closed formula for the diffusion coefficient exists only for the overdamped situation  @xcite .",
    "it predicts the presence of a striking enhancement of @xmath4 near a threshold , @xmath9 , separating the locked from the running phase and corresponding to the disappearance of the local minima of the potential .    on the other hand , in the underdamped regime",
    "there is no analytic expression for @xmath4 , but the enhancement of the diffusion coefficient , occurs at a lower threshold , @xmath10  @xcite due to the effect of inertia , and the phenomenon remains qualitatively similar .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to consider the effects of interactions among particles on the transport properties in such systems .",
    "specifically , we will address the following question : how do interactions occurring via elastic / inelastic hard - core collisions affect the mobility and the diffusion of an assembly of particles ?",
    "this issue is particular relevant in one dimension where a repulsive hard - core interaction inhibits the particles to pass each other ; this constraint is known to influence dramatically the dynamics of a group of particles . as an example , we can mention the anomalous self - diffusion in single file systems @xcite .",
    "we focus our dynamical approach only on exploring the effects of repulsive interactions via impulsive contact collisions .",
    "we consider two possibilities , energy conserving collisions and dissipative inelastic collisions .",
    "both situations are still largely unexplored in systems with washboard potentials and display non - trivial behaviors , as we shall illustrate .",
    "for instance , the mutual repulsion between the particles induces dynamical correlations which may favor or hinder their motions : it can promote their exit from a potential well via energetic collisions , or , on the contrary , it can prevent a jump to a given site when this is too crowded .",
    "in addition , the granular temperature , defined as the average kinetic energy per particle , in inelastic systems is in general lower than the corresponding temperature of elastic systems .",
    "therefore , the transport , occurring via thermally activated processes across substrate barriers , is expected to be less efficient for inelastic particles  @xcite",
    ". then few questions can be addressed .",
    "does the diffusivity @xmath4 present an enhancement analogous to that of non interacting systems ? does the threshold locked - to - running occur at larger values of the tilt ? in the following ,",
    "we answer the questions by examining a variety of situations and analyzing the overdamped and the underdamped regimes separately .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the model and discuss the contact elastic / inelastic interaction with their main implication in the system dynamics . in section iii , we analyze the results from the molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of the over - damped regime . in section iv",
    ", we summarize the corresponding results for the under - damped regime discussing the salient differences with the over - damped case .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in section v.",
    "we consider a randomly driven granular gas , already introduced in previous works  @xcite , composed of @xmath11 impenetrable hard - rods , of mass @xmath12 and size @xmath13 , moving on a line of length @xmath14 in the presence of an external washboard potential .",
    "the overall dynamics of this gas is described by the langevin equation for each rod @xmath15}{d x_i } + f   \\label{kramers2}\\ ] ] that embodies four types of physical phenomena : friction with the surroundings , random accelerations due to external driving , inelastic collisions among the particles and external time independent , but spatially varying , force .",
    "we model the first two effects by means of a stochastic bath with a viscous friction @xmath16 and gaussian random force , with zero average and covariance @xmath17 satisfying a fluctuation - dissipation relation , with @xmath18 proportional to the intensity of the stochastic driving  @xcite .",
    "the damping term fulfilling einstein s relation renders the system stationary even in the absence of collisional dissipation and physically can represent the friction between the particles and the container .",
    "the interactions among the particles , indicated formally by @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ kramers2 ] ) , amount to simple impulsive forces acting on the rod @xmath20 due to the collisions with the neighboring particles @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "thus a rod @xmath20 performs , under the influence of the bath and collisions only , independent brownian trajectories , unless it gets in contact with particle @xmath21 , i.e. @xmath22 , at which point the velocities of the colliding pair @xmath23 change instantaneously according to the inelastic rule @xmath24 @xmath25 the prime indicating post - collisional variables and @xmath26 the coefficient of restitution , with @xmath27 .    the total force , in eq .",
    "( [ kramers2 ] ) , on each particle is supplemented by terms representing the presence of a constant external bias , @xmath0 , and a periodic substrate generating a potential @xmath28 , with period @xmath29 and amplitude @xmath30 , @xmath31 a quantitative criterion to distinguish between an overdamped and an underdamped regime is provided by the dimensionless parameter @xmath32 , where @xmath33}_{min}\\ ] ] is the oscillation frequency at the potential minimum .",
    "if @xmath34 the dynamics is overdamped , and in the opposite limit is underdamped .",
    "as discussed by borromeo and marchesoni @xcite , the present model is equivalent to consider the particles in a traveling potential , i.e. a periodic potential moving at speed @xmath35 , which is related to the tilt force by the relation @xmath36 . interestingly for speeds lower than a certain threshold the traveling wave has the capability of dragging the particles , a mechanism known as stokes drift @xcite .    thus , the system can equivalently describe the physics of a one dimensional granular gas where the periodic potential @xmath28 represents a series of compartments separated by walls , an experimental set - up recently employed to study the clustering behavior of vibrated granular gases  @xcite , or the roughness of an inclined plane  @xcite .",
    "we shall begin by considering the nearly overdamped regime ( @xmath37 ) , whose study is better understood because the system reaches a steady state rapidly due to the large value of the friction .",
    "our md simulations were carried out by evolving an initial configuration , where the particles were all located in the central well without overlaps and their velocities were extracted from a maxwell - boltzmann distribution of temperature @xmath18 .",
    "each run involved @xmath38 particles of size @xmath39 , mass @xmath40 , with three different values of the coefficient of restitution , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , respectively . the substrate potential was characterized by wells of width @xmath44 and height @xmath45 , in units of @xmath46 .",
    "finally , the heat - bath temperature has been chosen to be @xmath47 and @xmath48 . the time is measured in units of @xmath49 .",
    "the friction coefficient is @xmath50 .",
    "the cyclic system studied has been taken to be of length @xmath51 so that it is virtually equivalent to a system with open boundary conditions . in this condition of high dilution ,",
    "the global system density @xmath52 is extremely low , however it is not meaningful parameter , rather it is the initial density profile , characterized by the number of particles in a well @xmath53 , that has a strong influence on the system behaviour .",
    "indeed , at the beginning of the evolution , the system needs to be packed enough to reach a not negligible collision rate . only in the later stages of the simulations ,",
    "a crossover is observed toward the behaviour of rarefied gases .    at first sight ,",
    "the md simulations of the interacting system display a mobility quite similar to that of the non - interacting system : the curves @xmath54 versus @xmath0 for elastic and inelastic hard - rod systems are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mob ] . in the same figure",

    "the system evolution is simulated for @xmath62 time units .",
    "the full line indicates the corresponding curve for the non interacting particles obtained by the continued fraction method @xcite.,width=321 ]    however , a closer inspection reveals that differences do exist between the ibp and the interacting systems with different inelasticity @xmath26 .",
    "figure  [ fig : rapmob ] shows the ratio of the mobilities of interacting systems to the mobility of the ibp .",
    "this ratio , for small values of the load , @xmath63 , can be significantly different from @xmath64 , and more specifically the mobility of the eps exceeds the mobility of the ibp , whereas the mobility of the ips is lower .",
    "the reason for these differences can be found in the fact that contact interactions may change drastically , with respect to the ibp , the time that particles spend in a given potential minimum .",
    "( @xmath56 ) for @xmath65 ( circles ) , @xmath66 ( squares ) and @xmath41 ( triangles ) .",
    "the remaining parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : mob].,width=321 ]    in more detail , these behaviors can be explained by recalling that two competing mechanisms contribute to the system mobility : the excluded volume and the inelasticity .",
    "the first leads to an effective reduction of the barrier height and favors the escape from the wells , thus basically increasing the mobility .",
    "the second , instead , tends to decrease the average kinetic energy , rendering longer , on average , the time spent by the particles in a given well . for low values of the forcing field @xmath0",
    ", the mutual repulsion dominates and thus we observe a larger mobility of the eps with respect to the ibp at the same values of @xmath0 and @xmath18 .",
    "however , as we switch the inelasticity on , the mobility of the ips can become lower than that corresponding to the ibp . for @xmath67",
    ", @xmath3 turns out to be the same for all systems because in this regime only the forcing field @xmath0 matters .",
    "in fact , the absence of minima in the total potential reduces the influence of the mutual interactions so the particles follow coherently the strong effect of the drift .",
    "the role of the excluded volume can be highlighted by monitoring the trajectories of some specific tagged particles whose dynamics can be very representative of the evolution of the whole system .",
    "more specifically , we consider the two extremal particles , @xmath64 and @xmath11 ( having labeled the rods along the drift direction from @xmath64 to @xmath11 ) and the central particle @xmath68 .",
    "the first particle is , on average , braked by the collisions of the preceding particles , whereas the @xmath11-th particle is pushed ahead by the pressure of those behind .",
    "their overall behavior is expected to be qualitatively rather different from that of the central particle . in figure",
    "[ fig : raptraj ] , we display , for @xmath69 and @xmath70 , the evolution of the mean displacement of these three tracer particles from their initial position .",
    "each displacement is normalized with respect to the displacement of the center of mass of the whole system from its initial position : @xmath71 with @xmath72 and @xmath11 .",
    "all the averages are performed over @xmath73 independent runs .",
    "we consider , first , the eps for three values of the tilt @xmath0 , first column of fig .",
    "[ fig : raptraj ] . for all values of @xmath0 , the central particle moves with velocity very close to the center of mass velocity @xmath74 as shown by the fact that @xmath75 stays almost pinned around the value @xmath64 .",
    "the velocities of the extremal particles , instead , are very different from @xmath74 only during an initial transient when the system remains compact .",
    "indeed , it is clear that , in a system not yet too diluted , the motion of the first particle is frequently hindered by the others , while the motion of the last is favored .",
    "asymptotically , the differences in the motion of rods @xmath64 , @xmath76 and @xmath11 become less evident because the interactions become less effective as the packet spreads over and over .",
    "notice , also , the asymmetry between the first and the last particle .",
    "the major change observed when the inelasticity is turned on ( @xmath77 ) is that the velocity of the last particle displays a pronounced deviation from @xmath74 .",
    "these different behaviors are also evident by an inspection of the shapes of the instantaneous coarse grained distributions of particle positions ( fig .",

    "the dissipation , favoring clustering , makes the packets of the ips more compact and , in addition , changes the direction of the asymmetry , as seen for @xmath66 and @xmath41 , in fig .",
    "[ fignx ] .",
    "this effect can be quantified by means of the skewness of the particle distribution around their center of mass , @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the standard deviation and @xmath87 the center of mass position .",
    "positive values of @xmath88 entail distributions with an asymmetric shape extending out toward more positive tails .",

    "this means that it is not possible to reproduce the behavior of the ips by an appropriate choice of an effective temperature accounting for the inelasticity . a smaller temperature , in fact , would give a higher peak , but would not change the value of @xmath0 at which it occurs .",
    "moreover , the width of the peak decreases with @xmath18 and fails to reproduce the observed broadening in the ips , which is due to the inter - particle interactions . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : diff - ud ] , we display the ratio between the kinetic temperature @xmath132 and the heat bath temperature @xmath18 .",
    "notice that in both cases the peak occurs in correspondence of the peak of the curve @xmath133 of the elastic system and the ratio approaches , as expected , the value @xmath64 at low and high bias @xmath0 .",
    "in summary , in this work we have reported a numerical study on the dynamics and the transport of an array of identical particles in a inclined washboard potential .",
    "we investigated , at several tilting @xmath0 , the role of hard - core repulsive interactions among the particles on both the mobility and the spreading of the system with respect to its center of mass , indicators that are customarily used to characterize collective transport is such systems .",
    "we compared the behavior of three models involving respectively : independent brownian particles ( ibp ) , elastic particles ( eps ) and inelastic particles ( ips ) .",
    "we have found that , in the high friction regime , the transport behavior of the system with interacting particles is qualitatively similar to that of the non interacting system ( ibp ) .",
    "basically , the interactions do not strongly affect the mobility which remains close to the ibp value , while they modify the diffusivity that appears to be larger .",
    "this conclusion is intuitive , if we consider that @xmath3 is related the center mass velocity of the system , a quantity rather insensitive to the presence of interparticle interactions . to achieve a a finer information about the structure of the collective motion",
    ", we monitored the evolution of the particle spatial distribution .",
    "such a distribution strongly depends on the choice of the geometrical parameters and of inelasticity .",
    "this analysis shows that an initial localized packet of particle spreads differently in the inelastic system from the elastic one .",
    "the scenario in the underdamped regime is more complex .",
    "the eps systems , in fact , are similar to ibp either analyzing the mobility , or the diffusion of the particles .",
    "the inelastic interactions practically do not affect the mobility , whereas determine a marked change in the behavior of the diffusion at low temperatures and forces .",
    "the spreading , @xmath7 ( eq . ( [ diffusion ] ) ) , presents a clear two stage behavior : it increases nonlinearly in a transient regime which is then followed by a nonlinear growth , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sqrm ] . at higher temperatures",
    ", however , the diffusion of the inelastic particles exhibits a single regime , with a linear growth typical of a standard diffusion .",
    "our study indicates , moreover , that a group of particles interacting via inelastic hard - core collisions spread over much more than elastic particles .",
    "the mobility @xmath3 seems to be a global indicator that poorly encodes the information about the details of the interactions . on the contrary ,",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath4 is a much more representative observable being more sensitive to the presence of elastic or inelastic interactions .",
    "we believe that in the overdamped regime , it should be possible to apply theoretical methods already employed in the study of dense molecular fluid in narrow channels  @xcite , whereas the treatment of the underdamped case remains more problematic .",
    "the aim of the present numerical work is , perhaps , to stimulate further investigation and new theoretical proposals ."
