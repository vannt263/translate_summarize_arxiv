    "the unusual properties of strongly correlated electron liquid recently observed in high-@xmath1 superconductors ( htsc ) and heavy - fermion ( hf ) metals are due to quantum phase transitions taking place at their critical points .",
    "therefore , direct experimental studies of these transitions and critical points are of crucial importance for understanding the physics of strongly correlated metals . in case of htsc such direct experimental studies",
    "are absent since the corresponding critical points are `` shadowed '' by the superconductivity .",
    "recent experimental data on the behavior of hf metals pour a light on the nature of these critical points and corresponding phase transitions .",
    "thus , it is extremely important to study simultaneously both the high-@xmath1 superconductivity and the anomalous behavior of hf metals .",
    "a quantum phase transition is driven by control parameters such as composition , pressure , density @xmath2 of electrons ( holes ) , magnetic field @xmath3 , etc , and occurs at temperature @xmath4 .",
    "qcp separates an ordered phase generated by quantum phase transition from previously existing disordered phase .",
    "it is expected that the universal behavior is only observable if the heavy electron liquid in question is very near qcp , for example , when the correlation length is much larger than the microscopic length scales .",
    "quantum phase transitions of this type are quite common , and we shall label them as conventional quantum phase transitions ( cqpt ) . in this case , the approach known as the moria - hertz - millis theory is dealing with some kind of magnetically ordered state of a substance and focuses on the long wavelength low energy thermal and quantum fluctuations on this state background .",
    "the corresponding critical state near qcp is characterized by the complete absence of quasiparticles .",
    "it is commonly believed that the absence of quasiparticle - like excitations is the main cause of the non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) behavior and other types of the critical behavior in the quantum critical region .",
    "however , the predictions of theories based on cqpt fail to explain the strong nfl behavior observed in such hf metals as cecu@xmath5au@xmath6 , cecoin@xmath7 and ybrh@xmath8si@xmath8 near the magnetic ordering transition or in such hf metal as @xmath9 showing neither evidence of the magnetic ordering and/or superconductivity down to the lowest temperatures nor the lfl behavior @xcite .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the magnetic ordering does not play the key role in the nfl behavior and can be considered as a side effect adding specific features to the corresponding nfl behavior .",
    "the landau fermi liquid ( lfl ) theory rests on both the notion of quasiparticles representing elementary excitations of a fermi liquid and the concept of the order parameter which characterizes the ordered phase .",
    "quasiparticles are appropriate excitations to describe its low temperature thermodynamic properties .",
    "the inability of the lfl theory to explain the experimental observations which point to the dependence of quasiparticle effective mass @xmath10 on temperature @xmath11 and applied magnetic field @xmath3 may lead to the conclusion that landau paradigm related to the quasiparticles and order parameter fail to explain the experimental facts on the nfl behavior of strongly correlated electrons @xcite .",
    "however , other experimental facts show that quasiparticles do exist near cqp @xcite while @xmath10 depends strongly on magnetic field and temperature @xcite . as a result",
    ", we can safely conclude that the fluctuations are not responsible for observed nfl behavior , the quasiparticles are not suppressed by them @xcite and landau paradigm survives also when dealing with strongly correlated electrons @xcite",
    ". therefore the problem of the nfl behavior can be resolved within the lfl theory providing that quasiparticles form so - called fermion - condensate ( fc ) state @xcite emerging behind the fermion condensation quantum phase transition ( fcqpt ) @xcite .",
    "it is possible to explain the `` whole bunch '' of observed thermodynamic properties of hf metals on the basis of fcqpt allowing for existence of landau quasiparticles down to the lowest temperatures @xcite .",
    "the experiments on hf metals and htsc explore mainly their thermodynamic properties .",
    "it is highly desirable to probe the other properties of the heavy electron liquid like quasiparticle occupation numbers , which are not directly linked to the density of states or to the behavior of the effective mass @xmath10 .",
    "both scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) and point contact spectroscopy ( pcs ) based on andreev reflection ( ar ) @xcite being sensitive to both the density of states and quasiparticle occupation numbers are ideal techniques to study the effects of particle - hole symmetry violation , making the differential tunneling conductivity and dynamic conductance to be asymmetric function of applied voltage .",
    "this asymmetry can be observed when hf metals and htsc are either normal or superconducting .",
    "we note that this asymmetry is unusual in conventional metals , especially at low temperatures . in the case of lfl the particle - hole symmetry conserves and both the differential tunneling conductivity and dynamic conductance are symmetric functions of voltage bias .",
    "thus , stm and pcs provide a new direction in the experimental studies of the nfl behavior of htsc and hf metals .    in this letter",
    "we show that a particle - hole symmetry is violated when the heavy electron liquid undergoes fcqpt . as a result , both the differential tunneling conductivity @xmath12 and the dynamic conductance @xmath13 become asymmetric as a function of voltage @xmath0 .",
    "we demonstrate that the asymmetric part is defined by a temperature independent part of the entropy characterizing the normal state of the electronic system of a strongly correlated metal , and the study of the thermodynamic properties is possible by measuring the transport characteristics of the metal . while the application of magnetic field destroys the nfl behavior of the heavy electron liquid and restores the above symmetry .",
    "therefore the measurements of asymmetric part of the conductance can be viewed as a powerful tool to investigate the nfl behavior of strongly correlated fermi systems .",
    "the tunneling current @xmath14 through the point contact between two ordinary metals is proportional to the driving voltage @xmath0 and to the squared modulus of the quantum mechanical transition amplitude @xmath15 multiplied by the difference @xmath16 @xcite . here",

    "the wave function calculated in wkb approximation is proportional to @xmath19 . as a result",
    ", the density of states cancels down and the tunneling current becomes independent of @xmath20 @xcite .",

    "we use an atomic system of units : @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are electron charge and mass , respectively . since temperature is low , we approximate @xmath22 by the step function @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the chemical potential .",

    "we have shown that at small values of the voltage bias the asymmetric part is a linear function of the voltage and inversely proportional to the maximum value of the gap and does not depend on temperature provided that metal is superconducting , when it becomes normal the asymmetric part diminishes at elevated temperatures .",
    "our theoretical results are in good agreement with available experimental data while it proved out to be very useful to explore the asymmetric part of conductivity rather then the conductivity .",
    "since in pure lfl case the particle - hole symmetry is conserved and both the differential tunneling conductivity and dynamic conductance are symmetric functions of voltage bias , the measurements of asymmetric part of the conductance can be viewed as a powerful tool to investigate the nfl behavior of strongly correlated fermi systems .",
    "we have derived that the asymmetric part is defined by the temperature independent part of the entropy characterizing the normal state of the electronic system of a strongly correlated metal . as a result , it became possible to study the thermodynamic properties measuring the transport characteristics of a substance . thus , stm and pcs provide a new and very useful direction in the experimental studies of the nfl behavior of htsc and hf metals .",
    "finally , our consideration of the conductance asymmetry observed in both hf metals and high-@xmath1 superconductors and described within the same framework suggests that fcqpt is intrinsic to strongly correlated substances and can be viewed as the universal cause of the non - fermi liquid behavior ."
