    "the d0 collaboration has recently reported a new measurement of the like - sign dimuon charge asymmetry in semileptonic @xmath0-hadron decays  @xcite which disagrees with the standard model ( sm ) prediction by about three standard deviations .",
    "although this finding still needs to be confirmed by future experiments , it might be a clue to the presence of unexpectedly substantial @xmath1-violating new physics in the mixing of @xmath2 mesons .",
    "subsequently , we have suggested as one of the possible scenarios for the new physics that the d0 result could be attributed to a nonstandard spin-1 particle lighter than the @xmath0 quark , with flavor - changing couplings to the @xmath0 and @xmath3 quarks  @xcite .",
    "specifically , we showed that the effect of the new particle can lead to a prediction which is consistent with the new data within its one - sigma range .",
    "new - physics scenarios involving nonstandard spin-1 particles with masses of a few gev or less have been discussed to some extent in various other contexts in the literature .",
    "their existence is generally still compatible with currently available data and also desirable , as they may offer possible explanations for some of the recent experimental anomalies and unexpected observations .",
    "for instance , a spin-1 boson having mass of a few gev and couplings to both quarks and leptons has been proposed to explain the measured value of the muon @xmath11@xmath122 and the nutev anomaly simultaneously  @xcite . as another example , @xmath13(mev ) spin-1 bosons which can interact with dark matter as well as leptons may be responsible for the observed 511-kev emission from the galactic bulge  @xcite .",
    "if its mass is at the gev level , such a particle may be associated with the unexpected excess of positrons recently observed in cosmic rays , possibly caused by dark - matter annihilation  @xcite . in the context of hyperon decay , a  spin-1 boson with mass around 0.2gev , flavor - changing couplings to quarks , and a dominant decay mode into @xmath14 can explain the three anomalous events of @xmath15 reported by the hypercp experiment several years ago  @xcite .",
    "although in these few examples the spin-1 particles tend to have suppressed couplings to sm particles , it is possible to test their presence in future high - precision experiments  @xcite .",
    "it  is therefore also of interest to see if the light spin-1 boson that could be responsible for the anomalous d0 result contributes to some other @xmath0-meson processes , perhaps with detectable effects , which we will attempt to do in this paper .",
    "here we consider the possibility that the new spin-1 particle , which we shall refer to as  @xmath16 , has flavor - conserving couplings to the electron and muon , besides its flavor - changing couplings to the @xmath0 and @xmath3 quarks .",
    "accordingly , it can contribute to a number of rare @xmath5 transitions involving the charged leptons , via the quark - level process @xmath17 , where @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , we will deal with the impact of @xmath16 on the inclusive @xmath0-meson decay @xmath18 and the exclusive ones @xmath19 and @xmath20 , all of which have been observed  @xcite , as well as the leptonic decay @xmath21 . using the existing experimental information on",
    "the @xmath0-meson decays as well as the recent data from  d0 on @xmath2 mixing , we will explore constraints on the couplings of  @xmath16 . since @xmath16 has flavor - conserving interactions with the leptons and hence contributes to their anomalous magnetic moments , we will also take their measured values into account .    in the following section ,",
    "we write down the relevant lagrangians and derive the amplitudes for the processes of interest . in sec .",
    "[ numbers ] , we present our numerical results for the constraints on the @xmath16 couplings and provide some predictions which may be tested at lhcb or future @xmath8 factories .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ concl ] and collect some of the formulas in appendixes .",
    "we adopt a model - independent approach , assuming in addition that @xmath16 carries no color or electric charge and its couplings to the fermions have both vector and axial - vector parts .",
    "the lagrangian for its flavor - changing interactions with the @xmath0 and @xmath3  quarks is then  @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 parametrize the vector and axial - vector couplings , respectively , and in general can be complex , which would be new sources of @xmath1 violation . moreover , the flavor - conserving couplings of @xmath16 with a charged lepton @xmath25 is described by @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are real parameters because of the hermiticity of  @xmath29 .",
    "we will study only the @xmath30 and @xmath31 cases due to lack of the relevant data for @xmath32 at present . in the absence of model specifics , @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    "are not necessarily related . in principle",
    ", @xmath16  can have additional interactions , flavor - conserving and/or flavor - violating , with other fermions which are parametrized by more coupling constants .",
    "we assume that these additional parameters already satisfy other experimental constraints to which they are subject , but which we do not cover in this paper .    together @xmath35 and @xmath36 generate the contributions of @xmath16 to the above - mentioned @xmath5 transitions .",
    "for the inclusive decay @xmath18 , the resulting amplitude is @xmath37b\\,\\bar\\ell\\gamma_5^{}\\ell } { m_x^2\\bigl(q^2-m_x^2+i\\gamma_x^{}m_x^{}\\bigr ) } ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the combined momentum of the dilepton and @xmath39 the total width of  @xmath16 .",
    "we remark that the presence of the @xmath40 dependence in the denominators distinguishes this new - physics scenario from others involving heavy particles , which would induce four - fermion operators with coefficients independent of @xmath40 , as have been studied in the literature  @xcite .",

    "one can see that the @xmath56 amplitude is independent of  @xmath24 .",
    "the corresponding decay rate is given in appendix  [ rates ] .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that the @xmath63-meson decay @xmath64 involving a pseudoscalar meson @xmath65 containing an @xmath66 component in its quark content , such as @xmath67 and @xmath68 , also has an amplitude independent of  @xmath24 .",
    "consequently , the observation of @xmath64 will provide additional information on the @xmath16 contributions involving the products @xmath69 and @xmath70 .      from the squared amplitude for @xmath71",
    ", one can arrive at two additional observables which have been measured besides the branching ratio .",
    "they are the @xmath79 longitudinal polarization fraction @xmath80 and the lepton forward - backward asymmetry @xmath81 , which are defined from  @xcite @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the angle between the directions of @xmath84 and @xmath85 in the dilepton rest frame . since these observables are ratios of squared amplitudes , their dependence on the hadronic form - factors is partly canceled , which reduces the theoretical uncertainties associated with the form factors .",
    "especially @xmath81 is predicted with good precision in the sm to have a zero - crossing point at @xmath86  @xcite , which makes this asymmetry very sensitive to the signals of new physics that can shift the location of the point . in appendix  [ rates ] we have written down @xmath80 and @xmath81 in terms of  @xmath87 .",

    "( [ hb2sx2sll ] ) after making the approximation @xmath88 in the center - of - mass frame of  @xmath89 and neglecting the @xmath39 part .",
    "thus , using the matrix elements @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 , we arrive at  @xcite @xmath93 since @xmath94 , the sm yields @xmath95 the sum of the two results in the decay rate @xmath96 hence @xmath97 does not probe either @xmath23 or  @xmath27 .    the @xmath16 interaction with the lepton @xmath25 as described by @xmath36 in eq .",

    "<S> the anomalously large like - sign dimuon charge asymmetry in semileptonic @xmath0-hadron decays recently measured by the d0 collaboration may be hinting at the presence of @xmath1-violating new physics in the mixing of @xmath2 mesons . </S>",
    "<S> it has been suggested that the effect of a nonstandard spin-1 particle lighter than the @xmath0  quark with flavor - changing couplings to @xmath0 and @xmath3 quarks can reproduce the d0 result within its one - sigma range . </S>",
    "<S> here we explore the possibility that the new particle also couples to charged leptons @xmath4 and thus contributes to rare @xmath5 processes involving the leptons . </S>",
    "<S> we consider in particular constraints on its couplings from existing experimental data on the inclusive @xmath6 and exclusive @xmath7 decays , as well as the anomalous magnetic moments of the leptons . </S>",
    "<S> we find that there is parameter space of the particle that is allowed by the current data . </S>",
    "<S> future measurements of these @xmath8 transitions and rare decays of the @xmath2 meson , such as @xmath9 and @xmath10 , at lhcb and next - generation @xmath8 factories can probe its presence or couplings more stringently . </S>"
