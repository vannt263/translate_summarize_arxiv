    "already for some time , it has been customary to look for cp - violating effects beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "all extensions of the sm contain possible new sources of cp violation through additional cp - violating phases .",
    "in particular , in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the higgs mixing parameter @xmath10 in the superpotential , two of the soft susy - breaking majorana gaugino masses @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , and the trilinear couplings @xmath13 ( corresponding to a fermion @xmath14 ) can have physical phases , which can not be rotated away without introducing phases in other couplings  @xcite . from the point of view of baryogenesis , one might hope that these phases are large  @xcite . on the other hand , the experimental limits on electron and neutron electric dipole moments ( edms )  @xcite , @xmath15  e / gev , @xmath16  e / gev , place severe constraints on the phase of @xmath10 , @xmath17  @xcite , for a typical susy mass scale of the order of a few hundred gev .",
    "a larger @xmath18 imposes fine - tuned relationships between this phase and other susy parameters  @xcite .",
    "cp - violating effects that might arise from @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 are light quarks ) are very much suppressed as they are proportional to @xmath21 . on the other hand ,",
    "the trilinear couplings of the third generation @xmath22 can lead to significant cp - violation effects , especially in top quark physics  @xcite .",
    "phases of @xmath10 and @xmath22 also affect the higgs sector in a relevant way . although the higgs potential of the mssm is invariant under cp at tree level , at loop level cp is sizeably violated by complex couplings  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the three neutral higgs mass eigenstates are superpositions of the cp eigenstates @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .    in this paper , we study cp violation in the decays @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the mssm with complex parameters .",
    "in particular , we calculate the cp - violating asymmetry @xmath26 due to one - loop exchanges of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath24 , see fig .  1 , taking into account cp violation in the neutral higgs system according to @xcite . of course , the diagrams of fig .",

    "since @xmath18 is highly constrained , the most important phases in our analysis are @xmath32 and @xmath33 , the phases of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , we expect the graph with @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 in the loop to be the most important one , and @xmath3 to be large in the case @xmath34 . in principle , there would also be a contribution due to @xmath35 and @xmath36 exchange analogous to fig .",
