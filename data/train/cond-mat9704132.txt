    "recent experiments on @xmath8 have exploited nonuniform current distributions to reveal the nonlocal nature of the conductivity in the vortex - liquid regime .",

    "the conductivity is always nonlocal on some microscopic scale , but the term  nonlocal \" is generally reserved for cases in which the length scale involved is much longer than some underlying microscopic one .",
    "a nonlocal conductivity implies a nonlocal resistivity , though the length scales on which each varies may differ .",
    "nonlocality may result if the  integrity \" of the vortex along the @xmath0 axis is maintained ( _ i.e. _ not much cutting and reconnecting ) as then a current applied at the top of a sample will yield a response not only at the top but also at the bottom . the interactions between vortices may also lead to nonlocal effects within the @xmath1 plane",
    ".    the nonlocal nature of the conductivity has been studied by safar _",
    "@xcite they injected small currents into the top of a sample with a magnetic field applied along the @xmath12 axis .",
    "they extracted the current in one case from a second contact along the top and in another case from the bottom . in each configuration a series of voltage differences were taken .",
    "the results were then analyzed assuming a local though anisotropic conductivity ( @xmath13 )  the so - called modified montgomery analysis .",
    "safar _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite found an effective value for the ratio @xmath14 for each configuration and discovered a discrepancy of order @xmath15 between them .",
    "the inadequacy of the local analysis is taken as evidence for a nonlocal conductivity .",
    "similar evidence for nonlocal effects in bscco has been reported @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out that the nonlocal interpretation has been questioned both on theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite grounds .",
    "it should also be noted that the large effects seen by safar _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite were in heavily twinned samples .",
    "evidence for nonlocal effects in pure samples is somewhat weaker .",
    "_ @xcite made a direct comparison of twinned and untwinned samples .",
    "in the first of the current configurations described above ( current into and out of the top ) , they took voltage measurements across the top and bottom of their samples as a function of temperature .",
    "in twinned samples of ybco , the resulting curves @xmath16 and @xmath17 became almost indistinguishable at temperatures above the melting transition , indicative of a long @xmath0-axis length scale in the vortex liquid regime . in untwinned crystals , on the other hand ,",
    "the curves only met at the melting transition .",
    "this result demonstrates the enhancement of the vortex - line integrity and hence nonlocality by the correlated defect .    on the theoretical side nonlocal conductivity",
    "has been studied within the hydrodynamic framework@xcite .",
    "we are assuming a linear but nonlocal relationship between current and electric field , _ i.e. _ an integral version of ohm s law @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "if the system is translationally invariant , fourier transforming equation ( [ ohm ] ) results in @xmath20 where nonlocality now implies @xmath21 the emphasis is on the large - distance behavior in real space and so presumably on the small-@xmath22 behavior of the fourier transform .",
    "huse and majumdar@xcite explored a hydrodynamic approach , in which the small-@xmath22 expansion of @xmath23 is truncated as follows : @xmath24 in the example they work out in detail to explain features seen by safar _",
    ", they include only one @xmath25 : @xmath26 .",
    "it models the  tilt viscosity \"  which measures the influence of pancake vortices moving in one @xmath1 plane on those moving in another when they travel with different velocities.@xcite    stability requires that @xmath27 be a positive definite matrix .",
    "for the hydrodynamic form of @xmath27 , it implies , for example , that @xmath26 and @xmath28 must be positive .",
    "when these conditions are met , one finds that the _ resistivity _ decays with a length scale of order ( @xmath29 ) , which is in turn the length scale of the electric - field and current distributions.@xcite ( the hydrodynamic approach also predicts surface currents which supposedly should be spread out over some small length scale not accessible by that technique . ) recent calculations@xcite starting from the time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) equation find that many of the @xmath25 s do not have the requisite sign  at least not for clean samples at high temperatures .",
    "those calculations were taken only to gaussian order ( lowest order in perturbation theory ) ; the purpose of the present paper is to go beyond gaussian order and also to explore the effect of various sorts of defects : point , columnar and planar .",
    "recent simulations of the tdgl equations in two dimensions did find a region above the melting transition in which @xmath30 .",
    "@xcite ( the problem of calculating the voltage distribution whether or not the conductivities are of the  hydrodynamic \" form will be presented elsewhere .",
    "@xcite )    the first order of business is to calculate the uniform conductivity @xmath31 .",
    "the resistivity of clean samples of ybco in the vortex - liquid regime varies smoothly with temperature until it experiences a sudden drop generally associated with the first - order melting transition to a pinned vortex solid .",
    "the temperature and field dependences in this smooth region agree with the flux - flow formula @xcite which was originally conceived of in the vortex - solid phase where one pictures the translation of the entire unpinned vortex lattice .",
    "so how is it that the same physics applies in the vortex - liquid regime ?",
    "the important feature of the flux - flow formula besides the absence of pinning by defects would seem to be its insensitivity to viscous effects . as it is the entire vortex system that moves , the amount of entanglement along the @xmath0-axis or the extent of crystalline order in the @xmath1 plane is irrelevant .",
    "it takes a nonuniform current distribution to probe such viscous effects .",
    "we will determine @xmath31 in two ways .",
    "first , we will consider the tdgl equation with an explicit uniform electric field applied , calculating the current and extracting @xmath31 directly .",
    "second , we will calculate the conductivity from the kubo formula , a version of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem which yields the linear response of a system not too far from equilibrium .",
    "the electric field does not explicitly appear in the latter .",
    "we will see that a delicate cancellation of terms arising in the kubo calculation is necessary for the two approaches to agree , and we will demonstrate this cancellation to second order in perturbation theory for the conductivity of two - dimensional samples",
    ". we will then proceed to examine the nonlocal effects within the kubo formalism , see how the @xmath32 cancellation breaks down at @xmath33 and show how viscous effects may enter .",
    "next we consider the effect of disorder  first on the uniform conductivity .",
    "it would seem to have two competing effects .",
    "on one hand , defects pin the vortices and thus might lower the resistivity . on the other hand , they disrupt the formation of a vortex lattice @xcite which is more readily pinned than individual vortices , and thus they might raise the resistivity .",
    "in fact , both effects are seen in the experiments of fendrich _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite in which point defects were induced by electron irradiation . introducing the defects eliminated the sudden drop in resistivity at @xmath34 . at temperatures above @xmath34 ,",
    "the irradiated sample had a lower resistivity ; while at temperatures below @xmath34 , it had a higher resistivity .",
    "another outcome of inducing the defects is that the temperature and field dependence is no longer of the flux - flow type . at low temperatures",
    "an activated form might be expected @xcite , but such considerations are beyond the scope of the present work which employs standard perturbation theory .",
    "we will examine the effect of these defects in the weak disorder limit .",
    "even the lowest - order calculation of @xmath35 , the wave - vector and frequency - dependent conductivity , is cumbersome .",
    "@xcite to simplify the results we will concentrate on the leading behavior . in the presence of a magnetic field , landau levels provide a natural basis for calculating and describing various phenomena .",
    "two energy scales naturally arise : the first is @xmath36 , the energy of states in the @xmath37 or lowest landau level ( lll ) ; the second is the energy spacing between landau levels given by @xmath38 with @xmath39 the cyclotron frequency .",
    "we will gain an immense simplification by focusing on the regime in which @xmath40 , the so - called lll approximation .",
    "arguments based on the _ renormalized _ values of @xmath36 and @xmath38 suggest that such a separation of scales holds over a significant portion of the vortex - liquid regime .",
    "@xcite note that @xmath40 limit does not imply that only @xmath37 states are employed in a calculation , although it usually does imply that the number of @xmath41 states is kept to a minimum . considering only fluctuations in the lll states",
    "serves not only to simplify the calculations but also to regularize them .    before presenting the calculations in detail",
    "let us highlight a couple key features .",
    "the kubo formula for the conductivity involves the product of two current densities , and each current density involves a product of a @xmath42 and a @xmath43 , where @xmath42 is the superconducting order parameter .",
    "( see eqs .",
    "( [ kubo1 ] ) and ( [ kubo2 ] ) below . )",
    "thus , calculated in this way the conductivity is a  four - point \" object , that is , it involves four @xmath42 fields .",
    "if these @xmath42 s are expanded in the landau - level basis , a crucial question arises : how many of these four @xmath42 s can be in the lll ? already we find a notable distinction between the @xmath0-axis conductivity , @xmath44 , for which the answer is all four and the @xmath1-plane conductivity , @xmath45 , for which the answer is only two . as a result , in the lll regime",
    "the characteristic time scale inherent in @xmath46 is much larger than that in @xmath47 .",
    "another outcome is that in terms of lll states ( @xmath45 ) is a two - point quantity and as such is independent of viscous effects which are related to four - point quantities .    understanding the effect of random pinning in the vortex - liquid regime is no trivial matter .",
    "@xcite when point disorder is added , translational invariance is destroyed . moreover , while the division of @xmath48 into @xmath37 and @xmath49 parts persists , the @xmath37 component now becomes a four - point object sensitive to viscous effects . as a result the associated time and length scales may grow .",
    "the separation of @xmath37 and @xmath49 states also plays a role in the distinction between @xmath0-axis length scales in materials with correlated and uncorrelated disorder . to each energy level there",
    "is associated a @xmath0-axis length scale , and the one linked to the @xmath37 level is much longer .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath0-axis length scale of @xmath47 is controlled by the @xmath37 states in the presence of columnar and planar defects but by the @xmath49 states in the presence of point defects .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we lay the groundwork for the calculations that follow by constructing the green s function and correlation function from the tdgl equation . in the section following that we calculate the uniform conductivity , @xmath50 , first by explicitly applying the electric field and then via the kubo formula .",
    "we then move on to consider the nonlocal conductivity @xmath51 .",
    "after that we examine the conductivity of films .",
    "we then consider the effect of weak disorder and finally summarize .",

    "we have investigated the conductivity in the vortex - liquid regime via perturbation theory . using an approach in which an electric field is applied",

    "we identified the subset of diagrams that yields the same result calculated within the kubo formalism and conjectured that the remaining diagrams must cancel .",
    "we verified this cancellation to second order in perturbation theory and also demonstrated that the cancellation does not extend to the nonlocal conductivity @xmath51 , allowing viscous effects to enter .",
    "when it comes to the nonlocal conductivity and the issue of characteristic lengths , the present work has certainly raised more questions than it has answered .",
    "for instance , the lowest - order ( gaussian ) diagram of the transverse @xmath1-plane conductivity already revealed a long , temperature - dependent length ; while all of the diagrams for the longitudinal @xmath1-plane conductivity individually had short , temperature - independent length scales . if the longitudinal length scale is to grow long , as is suggested by its identification with shearing effects of a growing crystal , it will be through the combined effect of many diagrams .",
    "the nature of the diagrams that may lead to such an effect have been identified , but what remains unclear is whether the longitudinal and transverse length scales are independent or related .",
    "there is a similar question regarding the @xmath0-axis .",
    "every diagram contributing to the lll approximation of @xmath46 has @xmath233 , the temperature - dependent correlation length , as its length scale . on the other hand , at each order in the perturbative expansion of @xmath47 , the @xmath0-axis length scale is @xmath208 , a temperature - independent magnetic length . if @xmath301 is to become substantially nonlocal as @xmath221 is lowered , it will be through the combined effect of various orders .",
    "if the two length scales are long , it is unclear whether they will turn out to be essentially the same or distinct .",
    "in addition , there is the question of whether or not the @xmath1-plane and @xmath0-axis length scales grow independently .",
    "finally , these matters must be readdressed with regard to the nonlocal resistivity which may have its own distinct length scales .",
    "we also examined the effect of disorder on the @xmath1-plane conductivity . while there was a subset of diagrams that lead to the disordered analog of the flux - flow formula ,",
    "there were other contributions that coupled to the viscous effects even at @xmath32 .",
    "we also showed that diagrams contributing to the lll approximation had as their @xmath0-axis length scale @xmath208 in the presence of point defects and @xmath233 in the presence of columnar and planar defects .",
    "missing from this work is any consideration of what vector - potential fluctuations might do . including them would require a new kind or vertex , one involving a @xmath42 , a @xmath43 and an @xmath302 , where @xmath302 is the fluctuating part of the vector potential .",
    "the arguments leading to the flux - flow result may no longer hold when these new vertices are added . also lacking are the effects of maxwell s equations which are needed to form a complete set of equations . at low order these lead to back - flow effects and",
    "at higher orders may produce lattice effects .",
    "there are many challenging aspects of this problem to be resolved .",
