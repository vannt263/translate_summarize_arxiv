    "interstellar dust is heated by interstellar radiation from stars and reradiates in the far - infrared regime .",
    "if we fix the size distribution and composition of interstellar dust and the spectrum of interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) , we are in principle able to predict far - infrared spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "dsert , boulanger & puget ( 1990 ) discussed the interstellar dust size distribution and composition which reproduce various far - infrared data and interstellar extinction curve of the galaxy .",
    "dwek et al .",
    "( 1997 ) investigated more comprehensive interstellar dust size distribution and composition by using the data taken by the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) / diffuse infrared background experiment ( dirbe ) .",
    "they concluded that their models could explain far - infrared sed and extinction curve except far - uv extinction .",
    "dsert , boulanger & puget used the data taken by several instruments and in several sky fields , while dwek et al . only used the data taken by the cobe / dirbe and the cobe/ far infrared absolute spectrophotometer ( firas ) in three limited fields .    on the other hand , after fixing optical properties , size distribution and composition of dust grains , a series of papers by draine and li have modeled the far - infrared sed and the extinction curve ( e.g. , draine & li 2001 ) .",
    "they compared their model seds with observational far - infrared data of high galactic latitudes ( the galactic cirrus component ) , of two narrow regions in the galactic plane ( li & draine 2001 ) and of a smc region ( li & draine 2002 ) .",
    "they concluded that their model explains the far - infrared sed of the cirrus compoents and the smc .",
    "however , they could not explain the far - infrared sed from two galactic plane regions even if a mixture of two different temperature components is considered .",
    "the interstellar extinction curve is successfully explained by their dust model .",
    "zubko , dwek & arendt ( 2004 ) presented a new interstellar dust model considering the consistency with the interstellar elemental abundances .",
    "some of their models simultaneously explain the far - ultraviolet to infrared absorption and diffuse infrared emission of the interstellar dust .",
    "almost all these studies treated far - infrared radiation from cirrus at high galactic latitude or narrow regions of the galactic plane .",
    "nevertheless , the strongest far - infrared radiation comes from the galactic plane .",
    "shibai , okumura & onaka ( 1999 ) and okumura et al .",
    "( 1999 ) dealt with far - infrared data of the galactic plane .",
    "they investigated the color - color correlation of the cobe / dirbe far - infrared data in low galactic latitude areas with @xmath2 .",
    "they found that there is a strong correlation between 60  @xmath0 m , 100  @xmath0 m and 140  @xmath0 m intensities .",
    "nagata et al . ( 2002 ) derived an empirical relation between the 60  @xmath0 m ",
    "100  @xmath0 m flux color and the temperature of large grains ( lgs ) based on the color - color correlation in shibai et al .",
    "lgs have large heat capacities and are in radiative equilibrium with isrf .",
    "they developed a method of estimating the total far - infrared ( @xmath3 m ) flux only from 60  @xmath0 m and 100  @xmath0 m fluxes .",
    "they argued that their estimation is more accurate than previous ones such as helou et al .",
    "( 1988 ) .",
    "when we observe far - infrared radiation from the galactic plane , since the optical depth in the far - infrared is much smaller than that in the visible , we can detect a sum of far - infrared radiation from interstellar dust illuminated by a variety of isrf in a line of sight .",
    "we call this effect `` overlap effect '' . to avoid the overlap effect ,",
    "previous works have excluded the galactic plane data as can be seen in dsert , boulanger & puget ( 1990 ) and dwek et al .",

    ". 1999 and nagata et al .",
    "2002 ) , and an overall analysis of the far - infrared data of the entire galactic plane is still required to comprehend the intrinsic far - infrared emission properties of interstellar dust .    in this paper , we investigate the far - infrared emission properties of interstellar dust with the cobe / dirbe 60  @xmath0 m , 100  @xmath0 m and 140   @xmath0 m zodi - subtracted mission average ( zsma ) maps",
    ". analyzed areas are the galactic plane , the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) . in section 2 , we describe the data and the analysis method .",
    "the resultant color - color correlation and the validity of our analysis are examined in section 3 .",
    "we discuss the far - infrared emission properties of interstellar dust in section 4 , and finally we conclude in section 5 .",
    "we analyze the cobe / dirbe zsma map data , which is obtained in the cobe mission by averaging all data except the data with low confidence ( cobe / dirbe explanatory supplement : the galactic plane maps , 1993 ) , and by removing the zodiacal light .",
    "the angular resolutions of the cobe / dirbe all bands are 0.7 degrees .",
    "we analyze every pixel of the cobe / dirbe map data and do not integrate in some region .",
    "we analyze the 60  @xmath0 m , 100  @xmath0 m and 140  @xmath0 m data since it was demonstrated by shibai , okumura & onaka ( 1999 ) that there exists a strong correlation among the intensities in those three bands .",
    "the fluxes in those bands are considered to originate from the thermal radiation from large grains ( lgs ) and very small grains ( vsgs ) .",
    "the grain radii of lgs are larger than about 20 nm and they are in radiative equilibrium with isrf ( e.g. , draine & li 2001 ) .",
    "vsgs , which have smaller radii , are characterized by their small optical cross sections and heat capacities ; thus , the impact of individual photon is important for heating and the fluctuation of the grain temperature is large .",
    "this heating process is called stochastic heating , and stochastically heated grains temporarily achieve a temperature high enough to emit mid - infrared photons ( aannestad & kenyon 1979 ) .",
    "we do not use data in wavelengths other than 60  @xmath0 m , 100  @xmath0 m and 140  @xmath0 m .",
    "the flux in the cobe / dirbe 1.25  @xmath0 m , 2.2  @xmath0 m , 3.5  @xmath0 m and 4.9  @xmath0 m bands is dominated by stellar radiation ( dwek et al .",
    "we do not adopt those wavelengths since we study the optical properties of interstellar dust .",
    "as for 12  @xmath0 m and 25  @xmath0 m bands of the dirbe , shibai , okumura & onaka ( 1999 ) showed that the intensities in those bands correlate less strongly with 100  @xmath0 m and 140  @xmath0 m intensities , compared with the 60  @xmath0 m intensity .",
    "the radiation sources of 12  @xmath0 m and 25  @xmath0 m bands are vsgs and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) ( dwek et al .",
    "pahs are composed of carbon and hydrogen and their sizes are smaller than those of vsgs . as a result , in addition to optical properties as vsgs , optical properties as hydrocarbon",
    "are revealed in pahs . especially in the 12  @xmath0 m bands ,",
    "there are several pah band emission lines in addition to near to mid- infrared continuum ( dwek et al .",
    "the pah optical properties are dealt in other works such as draine & li ( 2001 ) and sakon et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "long - wavelength data at @xmath4 are also available .",
    "dwek et al .",
    "( 1997 ) showed that the integrated 240  @xmath0 m intensity in high galactic latitude is explained by simple extension of the 100  @xmath0 m and 140  @xmath0 m intensities radiated from lgs .",
    "thus , the 240   @xmath0 m band does not provide us any independent information on the lg temperature .",
    "instead it has information on the emissivity index @xmath5 ( see section 2.4 ) , which we assume to be 2 in this paper .",
    "the value of emissivity index , 2 , is according to the theoretical studies , e.g. , draine & lee ( 1984 ) , and the observational studies using the cobe / firas spectral resolved data , e.g. , reach et al .",
    "furthermore , the 240  @xmath0 m intensity data of each pixel do not have enough s / n .",
    "we examined the emissivity index by using the data at 100 , 140 , and 240 @xmath0 m by assuming a single - temperature component , and found that the emissivity index of each pixel is in the range of 2  4 . even if the emissivity index is not 2 , though each band s correction factor of cobe / dirbe will be changed , the results of this paper are changed little . the variations caused by",
    "the change of the emissivity index is comparable to the uncertainties of each band intensity .",
    "the problem of emissivity index does influence lg temperatures of each pixel .",
    "as emissivity index is larger , the lg temperature derived from the 140  100  @xmath0 m ratio is lower . for a precise determination of the emissivity index , sub - millimeter observations may be better suited ( e.g. , aguirre et al .",
    "2003 ) .      for the galactic plane",
    ", we analyze the region with @xmath6 and with @xmath7 .",
    "but because of the uncertainty in the zodiacal light model , we exclude the regions whose 60  @xmath0 m intensity is less than 3  mjy  sr@xmath8 .",
    "the excluded regions are about 10 percent of the entire galactic plane region .",
    "our purpose is to study the far - infrared emission properties of interstellar dust illuminated by isrf .",
    "when we observe far - infrared radiation from the galactic plane region , because the optical depth in the far - infrared is smaller than that in the visible , it is highly probable that we observe interstellar dust illuminated by a variety of isrf intensity in a line of sight . in these regions ,",
    "the hypothesis of uniform isrf intensity in a line of sight is not valid .",
    "we identify and exclude such regions in the galactic plane by taking correlation with radio continuum map in the following way .",
    "we use the radio continuum map at 10  ghz shown in handa et al .",
    "( 1987 ) and compare it with the cobe / dirbe zsma map .",
    "the radio map covers the galactic longitude @xmath9 from to and the absolute galactic latitude @xmath10 .",
    "we employ this radio continuum map in @xmath11 .",
    "we compare this map with the same region of the cobe / dirbe zsma map .",
    "the 10  ghz radio continuum mainly comes from supernovae remnants , planetary nebulae , and h ii region ( hirabayashi 1974 ) , where the isrf may tend to be locally high .",
    "such high - isrf regions should be more compact than the general interstellar medium which is known to be irradiated by a lower isrf intensity ( shibai , okumura & onaka 1999 ) .",
    "thus , a line of sight with high radio intensity is considered to contain a large volume of `` normal '' isrf intensity regions and a small volume of high isrf intensity regions , especially in the low galactic latitude because of the `` overlap effect '' .",
    "we distinguish such strong radio continuum regions from the other regions in the cobe / dirbe zsma map .",
    "we adopt a disk - like region with a radius of 5@xmath12 centered at ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) = ( , ) ( j2000 ) for the lmc region . in order to subtract the galactic far - infrared component in the lmc region",
    ", we use the outer rim of the lmc region , which is contained in the defined lmc region , to determine the galactic contribution .",
    "we fit a linear function of the coordinates to @xmath15 at each wavelength in the rim region .",
    "then this functional form is applied to the inner region and subtracted from @xmath15 of the lmc region .    considering the uncertainty in our estimate of the galactic far - infrared intensity , our analysis is limited to the region which matches the following criterion .",
    "we calculate the standard deviation ( @xmath16 ) of the residual intensity of the lmc rim region after subtracting the galactic far - infrared component ( @xmath17=0.23  mjy  sr@xmath8 , @xmath18=1.0  mjy  sr@xmath8 , @xmath19=5.4  mjy  sr@xmath8 ) .",
    "we adopt the data of the area where the intensity of the identified lmc component at all the wavelengths are higher than 5@xmath16 . as a result",

    "1999 ) .",
    "the angular resolution of the cobe / dirbe ( ) corresponds to 0.6 kpc at the distance of the lmc ( 50 kpc ) . in order to avoid the overlap effect ,",
    "we discriminate 30 doradus ( 30 dor ) from the other lmc regions , since there is a large variation of isrf intensity on small angular scale .",
    "we identify `` 30dor region '' as a disk - like region centered at ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) = ( , ) with a radius of .",
    "for the smc , we adopt a disk - like region centered at ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) = ( , ) with a radius of . to subtract the galactic far - infrared components",

    "the selected region corresponds to the western bar ( mizuno et al .",
    "2001 ) , but the eastern wing ( mizuno et al .",
    "2001 ) is excluded after our selection .      because the published cobe / dirbe all bands intensities are derived by assuming a source spectrum @xmath20 constant , we need to apply the color correction to the cobe / dirbe far - infrared data .",
    "the sed of the lg component is expressed with the emissivity index @xmath5 as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the planck function .",
    "the intensities at a wavelength @xmath23 before and after correction are defined as @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , and are related by the color correction factor , @xmath26 , as @xmath27 @xmath26 is derived from the table in the cobe / dirbe `` explanatory supplement : the galactic plane map '' by assuming that @xmath28 .",
    "we also suppose that the emissions at @xmath23=100 and 140  @xmath0 m originate from lgs .",
    "thus the lg temperature can be determined from @xmath29 .",

    "if the lg temperature is lower than 30 k , most of @xmath34 comes from vsgs . practically , the lg temperatures of all pixels analyzed in this investigation are lower than 30 k.    on the other hand , we mention the color correction of @xmath34 .",
    "there are many investigations about the shapes of sed around 60  @xmath0 m ( e.g. , dwek et al .",

    "the cobe / dirbe correction factors for @xmath37 ( @xmath36 ) are 0.91  1.00 .",
    "since these are `` modeled '' sed not `` observatianal '' sed , we do not apply the color correction to @xmath34 . and",
    "the uncertainty in the color correction will be same or much less than 60 @xmath0 m band uncertainties .",

    "the lmc and smc show significantly lower @xmath29 than the galactic plane .",
    "this indicates that the lg temperature is higher in the lmc and smc than in the galaxy .",
    "we propose some reasons for this . in the lmc and smc , because star formation activities are higher than in the galaxy , the mean isrf intensity and dust temperature are higher .",
    "low metallicity of the lmc and smc may also be responsible for their large isrf , since dust extinction tends to be small in metal - poor galaxies ( hirashita et al .",
    "2001 ; boissier et al . 2004 ) .    in the lmc and smc ,",
    "smaller dust extinction may also cause a harder isrf than in the galaxy .",
    "when isrf become harder such as in the lmc and smc , even if the total intensity of isrf is same , the ratio of uv photons to all photons become larger and the probability that uv photons hit vsgs become larger . as a result ,",
    "typical vsg temperature becomes higher and the 60  @xmath0 m intensity becomes higher than in the galaxy .",
    "however , the far - infrared color correlations of the lmc and smc seem to be on the main correlation of the galactic plane .",
    "if the main correlation exhibits the general optical properties of interstellar dust , this may indicate that there is little difference in the hardness of isrf among the galaxy , the lmc and the smc .",
    "this isrf hardness problem will be investigated in our future work .    on the other hand ,",
    "the color correlation in the 30dor region is similar to the sub - correlation of the galaxy .",
    "this suggests that the overlap effect is important in the 30dor ( see section 4.3 ) .    from shibai ,",
    "okumura & onaka ( 1999 ) , the mean value of @xmath29 in the range of @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) is lower than the mean value in the range of @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "they concluded that the variation of the isrf is not very large . to confirm this fact and investigate the variation of the far - infrared color in the galactic plane depending on the galactic longitude",
    ", we divide the cobe / dirbe galactic plane data into every @xmath63 .    in figure 6 , we show the color - color diagrams in various ranges in the galactic longitudes .",
    "the longitudes are divided in a width of .",
    "used data is same as figure 1a and 1b . from these figures , components around the dashed line shift along the main correlation as the galactic longitudes change",
    "this means that the dust temperature continuously drops as the direction changes from the galactic center to the anti - center .",
    "since the dust temperature reflect the isrf , the trend is consistent with the picture that the isrf is a decreasing function of the galactocentric distance .",
    "we calculate the mean value of @xmath29 of the each galactic longitude range from the value of all pixels of the each range .",
    "the mean lg temperatures in each range are derived from the mean value of @xmath29 in the each range .",
    "the mean lg temperature in @xmath64 is 18.2 k , while that in @xmath61 is 16.3 k ; therefore , the mean isrf intensity in the direction of the galactic center is twice as high as in the direction of the galactic anti - center by using equation ( a.3 ) .",
    "the present interpretation about the far - infrared color correlations is that the main correlation appears in the directions of no strong uv sources in a line of sight , and the sub - correlation appears in the directions of some strong uv sources . from figure 6 and the comparison with the radio intensity map ( above - mentioned ) ,",
    "this interpretation is most plausible .",
    "( 120mm,180mm)fig6.eps      as shown in figure 5 , the main correlation is not explained by the lg model , which indicates that other dust components such as vsgs should be considered .",
    "however , the main correlation does not agree with li & draine ( 2001 ) , although they include vsg components . on the other hand , the correlation identified by nagata et al .",
    "( 2002 ) is the sub - correlation defined by us .",
    "thus we do not have any appropriate physicals model which explains the main correlation .",
    "shibai et al .",
    "( 1999 ) took into account the two - photon heating to explain the far - infrared color correlation of the galactic plane , and fitted their model to the same sub - correlation as we identified .",
    "however , the two - photon heating model seems to be marginally consistent with the main correlation as well as with the sub - correlation , especially in the low @xmath58 ( i.e. , low @xmath65 in appendix ) regime .",
    "see appendix for the color correlation predicted by the two - photon heating model .",
    "the sub - correlation may result from the `` overlap effect '' , i.e. , effect of observing various interstellar grains illuminated by various isrf in a line of sight ( section 3.2 ) .",
    "as shown in figures 3a and 3b , the sub - correlation is seen in the directions with strong radio continuum , where the overlap effect is considered to be large ( section 2.1 ) .",
    "the other reason explaining origin of the sub - correlation , the difference of isrf hardness is available . from our estimation by using draine & li interstellar dust model , the main and sub - correlations can not be explained by changing only the intensity of isrf . to reproduce the sub - correlation by using draine & li dust model , we shall have to change the size distribution of interstellar dust and the hardness of isrf at the same time .    to examine the overlap effect , we construct the following model . for simplicity , we consider mixture of only two components .",
    "we assume that the first component has a common color , ( @xmath29 , @xmath54 ) = ( 2.50 , 0.176 ) , which is typical of the galactic plane in the region of @xmath66 ( shibai et al .",
    "we examine three colors for the second component : ( @xmath29 , @xmath54 ) = ( 1.50 , 0.337 ) , ( 1.00 , 0.570 ) and ( 0.500 , 1.42 ) , called cases 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively .",
    "the first two colors of the second components follow the main correlation , and the last color ( @xmath29 , @xmath54 ) = ( 0.50 , 1.42 ) is introduced based on the lg model to represent hot dust in high isrf environments . in each case , we change the mixing ratio of the first component to the second component from 0 to 100 .",
    "the color relations calculated by these mixtures are plotted in figure 7 and compared with the observational data of the galactic plane ( contour in figure 7 ) .    from figure 7",
    ", we observe that the calculated color correlations are located near to the sub - correlation in the color - color diagram .",
    "the fact that the color correlation shifts above the main correlation by the mixing effects can qualitatively explain the position of the sub - correlation .",
    "but it is difficult to reproduce the overall sub - correlation by a simple mixture of two components , especially at low @xmath29 .",
    "it may be necessary to consider an elaborate model of radiation transfer effects .",
    "for example , onaka et al ( 2003 ) demonstrated how far - infrared sed are changed by varying the distribution function of isrf intensity .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)fig7.eps      the main correlation can be fitted as @xmath67 we compare this relation with the colors of nearby galaxies compiled by nagata et al .",
    "for this aim , we derive @xmath58 from @xmath29 by fitting the planck function multiplied by @xmath68 .",
    "then we finally obtain the relation between @xmath54 and @xmath69 for the main correlation as shown in figure 8 . in the same figure",
    ", we also present the relations calculated from the lg model , and from the results in li & draine ( 2001 ) and in nagata et al .",
    "from figure 8 , we conclude that the main correlation reproduces the far - infrared color correlation of nearby galaxies .    dale & helou ( 2002 ) modeled typical infrared seds of nearby galaxies as a single parameter family of 60  100  @xmath0 m flux ratio . in figure 8",
    ", we show the color correlation found in their work .",
    "dale & helou color correlation is quite similar to the main correlation of the present work .",
    "we have investigated the far - infrared sed of the galactic plane , the lmc and the smc with the cobe / dirbe zsma map at @xmath70 60  @xmath0 m , 100  @xmath0 m and 140  @xmath0 m . for the galactic plane ,",
    "we have adopted the region with @xmath71 . to avoid an overlap effect ( effect of detecting all the cumulative far - infrared radiation from interstellar dust illuminated by various of isrf intensities in a line of sight ) , we have compared the galactic far - infrared map with the 10  ghz radio continuum map and have identified high radio continuum regions as regions with strong overlap effect .",
    "we have also analyzed the lmc and smc regions , where the contribution from the galaxy has been subtracted . to avoid the overlap effect ,",
    "the 30dor region has been separated from the other lmc area .",
    "we have examined the far - infrared color - color ( 60  @xmath0 m  100  @xmath0 m vs. 140  @xmath0 m  100  @xmath0 m ) diagram of the galactic plane , the lmc and the smc .",
    "we have found a common far - infrared color correlation ( called `` main correlation '' in this paper ) among those three objects .",
    "this fact indicates that there is a common far - infrared optical property in these three galaxies in spite of difference in isrf intensity and metallicity .",
    "then the main correlation reveals the existence of grain components other than lgs .",
    "although other components such as vsgs are taken into account , currently available models by li & draine ( 2001 ) fail to explain the main correlation .",
    "on the other hand , another color correlation ( called `` sub - correlation '' ) is found in regions with high radio continuum .",
    "the sub - correlation itself is identified by shibai , okumura , & onaka ( 1999 ) .",
    "the sub - correlation can be qualitatively explained by mixing two or more components , each of which have a color satisfying the main correlation or a color of a hot lg component ( representative of active star - forming regions ) .",
    "finally , we heve compared the main correlation with the color of nearby galaxies .",
    "we have found that the main correlation reproduces the far - infrared color correlation of nearby galaxies .",

    "shibai , okumura & onaka ( 1999 ) referred to okumura ( 1998 ) and investigated the process of grain heating by comparing 60  @xmath0 m intensity normalized to the total lg intensity with ultra - violet ( uv ) isrf intensity .",
    "they supposed that the radiation at @xmath70100  @xmath0 m and 140  @xmath0 m originates from lgs which are in radiative equilibrium with isrf . on the other hand , the radiation at @xmath7060  @xmath0 m is attributed to stochastically heated vsgs plus the lgs .",
    "the contribution of lgs to the 60  @xmath0 m intensity depends on the lg temperature , which is determined by fitting a spectral of @xmath72 of to the intensities at @xmath70100  @xmath0 m and 140  @xmath0 m . because the maximum of lg temperature is around 30 k in the analyzed region of their study ,",
    "the contribution from lgs to the 60  @xmath0 m band is negligible , and almost all the radiation at @xmath23=60  @xmath0 m comes from vsgs .",
    "then the 60  @xmath0 m intensity normalized to the total intensity of lgs can be interpreted as the far - infrared intensity radiation from vsgs normalized to that from lgs .",
    "we estimate this normalized intensity as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the optical depth at @xmath70100  @xmath0 m and @xmath22 is the planck function .",

    "the dependence of @xmath82 on the isrf intensity can be used to constrain the heating mechanism of vsgs . if @xmath83 , @xmath84 photons are absorbed on a cooling timescale of a vsg ( okumura 1998 ) .",
    "shibai , okumura & onaka ( 1999 ) concluded that the heating process of vsgs in the galaxy is two - photon heating .",
    "however , they identified only the sub - correlation ( see figure 1b ) .",
    "we consider that the main correlation is more essential and that the sub - correlation arises from the overlap effect ( see section 4.3 ) .",
    "we show the relation between @xmath65 and @xmath82 of the galactic plane , the lmc and the smc in figure 9 .",
    "the contours , which show the density of data points on the diagram , are drawn in the same way as in section 3.1 but the logarithmic bin size is 0.2 .",
    "we also show the relation calculated by the lg model , li & draine ( 2002 ) s model and nagata et al .",
