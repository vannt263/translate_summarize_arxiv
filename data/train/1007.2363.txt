    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) with a center - filled or composite morphology often host young pulsars whose strong relativistic winds can lead to the formation of pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) . in recent years",

    "in which a putative pulsar is suspected to power a pwn is g18.951.1 . for this composite snr , which is considered to be located in the sagittarius arm at a distance of @xmath22kpc @xcite ,",

    "@xcite also detected a localized region of hard x - ray emission in the 410kev energy band whose peak emission is centered at ra=18@xmath2129@xmath22033 , dec=@xmath2352589 ( see also their fig .  2 for its location ) .",
    "this hard x - ray emission is slightly offset from the region of enhanced radio synchrotron emission , similar to g326.31.8 @xcite .",
    "harrus et al . found that the x - ray emission from g18.951.1  is predominantly thermal , heavily absorbed with a column density of about @xmath3@xmath4 , and can be best described by a non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) model with a temperature of @xmath20.9kev and an ionization timescale of @xmath24@xmath25s@xmath7 . in a reanalysis of the _ asca _  data of the localized hard x - ray emission",
    ", we confirmed the existence of a non - thermal component , which seems to dominate the spectrum above 2kev .",
    "although _ asca _ s spatial resolution is insufficient to detect a point source within this region , it is possible that the hard x - ray emission indicates the location of an undetected pulsar .",
    "we have learned from _",
    "chandra _",
    "observations that many young pulsars , like those in 3c 58 and g21.5 - 0.9 as well as currently undetected pulsars , e.g. , the one in g327.1 - 1.1 , are embedded in extended non - thermal emission from the pwne . in the case of g18.951.1",
    "the extended emission is most likely also contaminated by diffuse thermal emission from the snr , but any non - thermal emission from a possible point source remained unresolved by _",
    "asca_. with _",
    "chandra _  we now have the opportunity to detect a point source in this extended emission .",
    "therefore , we conducted a follow - up _ chandra _  observation of g18.95 - 1.1 in order to search for an x - ray point source embedded in the extended emission , to determine its nature , and to characterize the spatial and spectral distribution of the hard emission to test if it is consistent with an x - ray synchrotron nebula .",
    "a 45ks _ chandra _  observation was executed on august 3rd , 2009 ( obsid 10098 ) using acis - i in vfaint mode with the aimpoint of the acis - i array centered onto the region in which the 410kev emission from _ asca _  overlapped the radio synchrotron emission ( see fig .",
    "data reduction was carried out with ciao4.2 and caldb version 4.2.2 , following standard procedures , except for the charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) correction .",
    "as during the last 11ks of the observation the focal plane temperature was warmer than -118.7c ( increasing from -119.0c to -118.4c ) , we applied a time - dependent cti correction following @xcite .",
    "the effects of this correction are marginal in the 0.358.0kev energy band as it adjusted the gain on average by @xmath20.5% to account for the increased cti at higher temperatures .",

    "this hard emission seems to originate from a point - like source and its immediate vicinity ( its extent corresponds to region e1 highlighted in fig .",
    "the point - like source is located at the northern tip of a trail of softer diffuse x - ray emission extending towards the se and pointing back towards the center of the remnant .",
    "the extended emission is well aligned with the radio synchrotron nebula , but does not appear to cover the full extent of the latter ( see red contours in fig .",

    "this object , cxouj182913.1 - 125113 hereafter , is the only x - ray point source detected within a circle of 14 radius centered on the position of the source .",
    "cxouj182913.1 - 125113 has no known radio , 2mass , optical , or @xmath30-ray counterpart .",
    "the brightest point source in the field ( the bright white object near the southern edge of the fov in fig .  [ f1]b ) was classified by @xcite as a late - type star and appears not to be associated with g18.951.1 .",
    "there are other sources in the field which could be pulsar candidates , notably the pair of sources near ra=18@xmath2128@xmath22360 , dec=@xmath2351008 ( @xmath26=@xmath2754574 , @xmath28=@xmath2951520 ) . however , these sources have soft x - ray spectra as indicated by their colors in fig .",

    "the other point - like objects in the field which appear on or outside the edge of the fov are most likely artifacts of the smoothing in regions with low and/or variable exposure .",
    "in addition , faint enhancements in the diffuse emission or in the background might appear to be point - like after smoothing .",
    "although the searches for pulsations in the radio by @xcite proved unsuccessful ( their closest search position is @xmath2@xmath32 away from cxouj182913.1 - 125113 ) , the coincidence of the x - ray and radio synchrotron emission as well as the cometary - shaped morphology of the diffuse x - ray emission , with a hard x - ray point source at the tip , seems to point at a pulsar and its wind nebula .    to test",
    "if the point source and the extended emission are consistent with this interpretation , we extracted spectra for the putative pulsar and from three extended regions to the south of this source , using the ciao tool specextract . for the putative pulsar we extracted all counts within a radius of @xmath33 , while the three elliptical extraction regions shown in fig .",

    "they contain all counts in the e2@xmath34e1 and e3@xmath34e2 regions .",
    "this approach was chosen because we wanted to see how the spectra and the x - ray luminosity change as a function of increasing distance from the pulsar candidate .",

    "the @xmath1 was allowed to vary , but was initially set to the galactic value of @xmath60@xmath4 @xcite .",

    "although these values are significantly higher than the typical ones of about 500kms@xmath7 @xcite , they are not unusual for pulsars with periods significantly larger than several milliseconds @xcite . a pulsar would be consistent with the derived spectral index from the powerlaw fit and the displacement between the radio synchrotron nebula and the x - ray point source .",

    "the spectra with a single vnei model @xcite resulted in @xmath69 values @xmath702 , while a vnei model with an additional component ( e.g. , @xmath71 ) produced ionization timescales of @xmath72s@xmath25 which indicate that the plasma is in collisional ionization equilibrium .",
    "the spectrum labeled e3 covers the bulk of the extended x - ray emission near the center of g18.951.1 .",
    "it has 8975 net counts and provides evidence of emission around 1.35kev .",
    "the model predicts a thermal plasma temperature of 0.48kev and a photon index of @xmath73=1.8 .",
    "the best - fit results are shown in table  [ t1 ] and are given for a 90% confidence level . in case of e3 , we freed the magnesium abundance to remove significant residuals around this line , yielding a relative mg abundance of 1.4@xmath74 .",
    "this ratio is consistent with the galactic value and agrees well with that reported by @xcite .",
    "the x - ray luminosities for e3 provide evidence that the gas is predominantly thermal , as 87% of @xmath12 is emitted by the thermal plasma component in the 0.58kev energy band .",
    "the thermal emission could originate from the snr s shell seen along the line - of - sight or from the pwn if it has been disturbed by the reverse shock so that thermal emission and non - thermal emission are intertwined .    for e3 , as well as for e1 and e2 ,",
    "the fitted hi  column density is consistent with the average galactic value of @xmath75@xmath4 .",
    "a column that high seems to imply a distance much larger than 2kpc .",
    "however , as @xcite and @xcite argue , the alternative distance of 15kpc suggested by @xcite appears unlikely , as the derived radio luminosity at this distance would be twice that of the crab nebula , and the swept up mass of about 3000@xmath76 and the explosion energy of @xmath77erg are unreasonably high . even if we determine a distance based on the best - fit , assuming @xmath78@xmath4 and an hi  volume density of @xmath79@xmath25 @xcite , yielding a distance of about 11kpc , the explosion energy of @xmath80erg as well as the swept up mass of @xmath81@xmath82m@xmath83 are still unreasonably high .",
    "we therefore adopt a distance of 2kpc for g18.951.1  and quote our results as a function of distance .",
    "the line emission seen in e3 remains undetected in the spectra for regions e2 and e1 ( 1685 and 435 net counts , respectively ) , but the bumps at about 1.87kev indicate the presence of emission and therefore a partly thermal origin of the gas .",
    "the photon index does not steepen significantly from e1 to e2 and the emission remains soft . for e1 73% and for e2 51% of the x - ray luminosity",
    "is produced by the thermal plasma component .",
    "fitting the spectra e1 , e2 , and e3 with only an absorbed powerlaw generally produces significantly worse fits ( @xmath84 ) with photon indices of @xmath73=1.9 ( e1 ) , 2.2 , ( e2 ) , and 3.9 ( e3 ) , respectively .",
    "moreover , the potential emission features make a pure non - thermal origin of the x - ray emission appear very unlikely .    because the pulsar and the pwn candidate are embedded within g18.951.1 , the non - thermal emission from these objects is expected to be highly contaminated by the thermal emission from the snr .",
    "we therefore adopt the temperature obtained from spectrum e3 to be representative for the inner part of g18.951.1  and freeze the @xmath64 for e1 , e2 , and @xmath85 , respectively ( see table  [ t1 ] ) .",
    "this approach seemed to be justified , because spectra extracted from diffuse emission north of the pulsar candidate also suggested the @xmath64 to range from about 0.40 to 0.55kev with relatively large uncertainties of 0.15kev and  values which are consistent with those listed in table  [ t1 ] .",
    "for the extended x - ray emission to be consistent with a pwn , several criteria have to be met ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "first , the x - ray surface brightness should decrease with increasing distance from the point source .",
    "second , the radio spectral index @xmath86 should be relatively flat ( @xmath87 , @xmath88 ) .",
    "third , the photon index @xmath73 should be steeper at x - ray energies than in the radio .",
    "as a consequence , the extent of the x - ray emission can be smaller than the extent of the radio emission , as the synchrotron lifetime of the electrons in the x - ray regime can be shorter than those at radio wavelengths .    to test these criteria and to model how much the spectra change with increasing distance from the pulsar",
    ", we discuss spectra extracted from regions e1 , @xmath85 , and @xmath89 and focus on the hard , non - thermal x - ray emission emitted above 2kev , which we solely attribute to the putative pulsar and the pwn . as can be seen from table  [ t1 ] , the fraction of the x - ray luminosity above 2kev decreases from 16% ( e1 ) , to 13% ( @xmath85 ) , down to 6% ( @xmath89 ) . if we take the hard x - ray luminosities and divide by the area of the extraction regions , we get surface brightnesses which decrease from @xmath90@xmath6ergs@xmath7arcsec@xmath91 for e1 , to @xmath92@xmath6ergs@xmath7arcsec@xmath91 for @xmath85 , down to @xmath93@xmath6ergs@xmath7 arcsec@xmath91 for @xmath89 .",
    "hence , the first criterion is fulfilled .    for the inner region of g18.951.1 ,",
    "flat radio spectral indices of @xmath94 @xcite and @xmath95 @xcite have been reported . as the radio emission",
    "is also polarized in this region , @xcite report an integrated polarization percentage of about 2.5% at 4.75ghz for the whole remnant , the second criterion is met , too .",
    "the average photon index derived from the x - ray spectral fits is @xmath96 , significantly steeper than the radio index , thereby satisfying the third criterion .",
    "there is no significant steepening towards the edge of the nebula ( see column 8 , table  [ t1 ] ) .",
    "we also fitted the spectra with the  fixed to the value of e3 , but the uncertainties were still too large to say with any confidence that there is a clear trend in photon index .",
    "furthermore , the major half - axis diameter of the x - ray emission in region e3 is about @xmath97 ( @xmath814pc@xmath8 ) , which is much less than the extent of the radio synchrotron contours at 10.55ghz in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] indicate .",
    "we conclude , that the extended hard x - ray emission originates from a pwn with a photon index between @xmath10 and an unabsorbed luminosity of @xmath98@xmath6 erg s@xmath7  in the 28kev energy band .",
    "we can now begin to estimate some of the fundamental properties of the putative pulsar in g18.95 - 1.1 . using the relationship between the spin - down energy loss rate ( @xmath99 ) and the non - thermal x - ray luminosity of the pulsar and the pwn @xcite of @xmath100@xmath6 erg s@xmath7",
    ", we estimate @xmath99 to be @xmath101 erg s@xmath7 .",
    "following @xcite , adopting an average age of g18.951.1  of @xmath102yr ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a canonical moment of inertia of the neutron star of @xmath103g@xmath104 , and assuming further a constant braking index of 3 , that spin down happens via magnetic dipole radiation , and that the current value of the pulsar s spin period is much larger than its initial one , the current spin period ( @xmath15 ) , the period derivative ( @xmath16 ) , and the surface magnetic field of the pulsar is estimated to be @xmath105s , @xmath106ss@xmath7 , and @xmath107 g , respectively .",
    "these parameters can only serve as rough estimates as they are derived from the relation between @xmath12 and @xmath99 which can vary by about one order of magnitude ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it should also be kept in mind that @xmath108 gives the field strength at the magnetic equator and that the field strength at the magnetic poles can be a factor of 2 higher .",
    "if the inferred values for the period , period derivative , and magnetic field are correct , this pulsar candidate occupies a highly interesting and sparsely populated place in the @xmath109 diagram .",
    "it would be located close to the line of the quantum critical field of @xmath110 g ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which divides normal radio pulsars and the more exotic radio - quiet objects , such as the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axp ) and soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) .",
    "we report the detection of a faint x - ray point source , cxouj182913.1 - 125113 , in the inner part of the composite snr g18.951.1  and a trail of diffuse emission pointing towards the center of the snr .",
    "these sources are considered to be the pulsar and its wind nebula .",
    "the best fit to the spectrum of the pulsar candidate is an absorbed powerlaw model ( @xmath73=1.6 , = @xmath3@xmath4 ) with an unabsorbed luminosity in the 0.58kev energy band of @xmath12@xmath111@xmath112@xmath6 erg s@xmath7 .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the pwn ( @xmath10 , = @xmath113@xmath4 ) amounts to @xmath12@xmath111@xmath114@xmath6 erg s@xmath7  in the 0.58kev energy band .",
    "it appears as if the spectrum extracted from the region which contains the pwn shows thermal emission from the snr along the line - of - sight or the pwn has been disturbed by the reverse shock so that thermal and non - thermal emission is mixed .",
    "although pulsations have not been reported for the pulsar , we estimate the spin period and the period derivative to be @xmath15=@xmath115s and @xmath16=@xmath116ss@xmath7 , assuming the dipole approximation .",
    "compared to other rotation - powered pulsars , a high magnetic field of @xmath107 g is implied by its location in the @xmath15@xmath16 diagram .",
    "this value is close to that of the quantum critical field and makes this source a highly interesting object for follow - up observations .",

    "<S> the x - ray spectrum of the point source is best described by an absorbed powerlaw model with @xmath0 and an @xmath1 of @xmath2@xmath3@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this model predicts a relatively low unabsorbed x - ray luminosity of about @xmath5@xmath6erg s@xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the distance in units of 2kpc . </S>",
    "<S> the best - fitted model of the diffuse nebula is a combination of thermal ( @xmath9kev ) and non - thermal ( @xmath10 ) emission . </S>",
    "<S> the unabsorbed x - ray luminosity of @xmath11@xmath6erg s@xmath7 in the 0.58kev energy band seems to be largely dominated by the thermal component from the snr , providing 87% of @xmath12 in this band . </S>",

    "<S> if we assume an age of @xmath25300yr for g18.95 - 1.1 and use the x - ray luminosity for the pulsar and the wind nebula together with the relationship between spin - down luminosity ( via magnetic dipole radiation ) and period , we estimate the pulsar s period to be @xmath13s . compared to other rotation - powered pulsars , a magnetic field of @xmath14 g </S>",
    "<S> is implied by its location in the @xmath15@xmath16 diagram , a value which is close to that of the quantum critical field . </S>"
