    "spectral lag , the arrival time delay between light curves in different energy bands ( or between correlated photons with different energies ) , is a common feature in gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ; e.g. , ) . generally speaking ,",
    "most grbs show _ positive _ lags , i.e. , light curves at higher energies ( say , in the mev range ) peak earlier than those at lower energies ( say , in a range of 10 s to 100 s kev ) . however , there some rare cases showing zero lags or even _ negative _ lags ( e.g. , @xcite ) . since the launch of the _ fermi _ satellite , many grbs with high energy emission above 100 mev have been detected .",
    "in contrast to the _ positive _ lags of low energy emission , gev photons are found delayed with respect to mev photons in many ( but not all ) grbs ( i.e. , _ negative _ lags ; see @xcite ) .",
    "some physical models have been formulated to account for the intrinsic origin of lags ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "particularly , @xcite showed that the intrinsic _ positive _ lags could be well reproduced by a simple model invoking synchrotron radiation from a rapidly expanding outflow .    on the other hand , one possible explanation for the _ negative _ lags",
    "is provided by quantum gravity ( qg ) effects .",
    "one such effect is the lorentz invariance violation ( liv ) .",
    "lorentz invariance is typically expected to be broken at the plank scale ( @xmath4 gev ; see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "many theories of qg predict that liv happens at high energy scales , since high energy photons may interact with the foamy structure of space - time at small spatial scales @xcite . in such cases , the speed of light in vacuum would depend on the energy of the photon , and high energy photons propagate in vacuum slower than low energy photons @xcite . the energy scale for liv , @xmath5 , could therefore be constrained by the arrival time differences of the photons with different energies originating from the same astronomical source @xcite .    thanks to their short spectral lags , cosmological distances , and very high energetic photons , grbs have been viewed as the most promising sources for studying the liv effects @xcite . in the past ,",
    "various limits on liv have been obtained from the spectral time lags of individual grb or a large sample of grbs ( e.g. , ) . in particular , @xcite used the time lag of the highest energy ( 13.2 gev ) photon from grb 080916c to constrain the linear liv energy scale ( @xmath6 ) and presented a stringent limit of @xmath7 gev , improving the previous limits by at least one order of magnitude . @xcite",
    "set the current strictest limits on both the linear and quadratic liv energy scales by analyzing the arrival time delay between a 31 gev photon and the low energy ( trigger ) photons from grb 090510 .",
    "the limits set are @xmath8 and @xmath9 gev . however , these limits were based on the rough time lag of a single gev - scale photon .",
    "it is necessary to consider using the true spectral time lags of bunches of high energy photons ( i.e , the lags of high - quality high energy light curves ) to constrain the liv .",
    "furthermore , since the emission mechanism of grbs is still poorly understood , it is difficult to distinguish an intrinsic time delay at the source from a delay induced by propagation in vacuum to the observer .",
    "that is , the method of the flght - time difference used for testing liv is hindered by our ignorance concerning the intrinsic time delay in different energy bands ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    the first attempt to disentangle the intrinsic time delay problem",
    "was presented in @xcite .",
    "they proposed to work on statistical samples of grbs at a range of different redshifts , and formulated the problem in terms of a linear regression analysis where the slope corresponds to the qg scale related to the liv effect , and the intercept represents the possible intrinsic time delay .",
    "this analysis has the advantage that it can extract the spectral time lags of broad light curves in different energy bands . in this manner ,",
    "a weak evidence for liv was found under the assumption that all grbs had the same intrinsic time delay @xcite . however , due to the fact that the durations of grbs span about six orders of magnitude , it is not likely that the high energy photons emitted from different grbs ( or from the same grb ) have the same intrinsic time lag as compared with the emission time of the low energy photons @xcite . as an improvement ,",
    "@xcite fitted the data of the energetic photons from grbs on straight lines with the same slope but with different intercepts ( i.e. , different intrinsic time lags ) .",
    "unfortunately , photons from different grbs on the same line still mean that the intrinsic time lags between the high energy photons and the onset low energy photons are approximately the same for these grbs , which is not always true and it could be a coincidence .",
    "@xcite estimated the intrinsic time lag between emissions of high and low energy photons from grbs by using the magnetic jet model .",
    "however , the magnetic jet model relies on some particular theoretical parameters , and this leads to uncertainties on the liv results .",
    "recently , _ fermi _ detected a peculiar burst grb 160625b , which had three dramatically different isolated sub - bursts @xcite , with unusually high photon statistics allowing the use of amply populated energy bands .",
    "here we calculate the spectral lags between the lowest energy band ( 1012 kev ) and any other high energy band for the second sub - burst of grb 160625b , and find that the lag increases at @xmath10 mev , and then shows a steep decline in the energy range @xmath11 mev . in other words ,",
    "the behavior of the spectral lags of this grb is quite different , and a transition from _ positive _ lags to _ negative _ lags is , for the first time , discovered within a burst . if the liv effect which happens at high energy scales is considered here , the observed time lag ( @xmath12 ) between different energy bands of a grb should consist of two terms @xmath13 where @xmath14 represents the intrinsic emission time delay , and @xmath15 denotes the time delay induced by the liv effect . instead of assuming an unknown constant for @xmath14 , we argue that the intrinsic lag should be positively correlated with the energy , i.e. , the higher - energy photon arrives earlier than the lower - energy photon @xcite . due to the liv effect at high energy scales , a high - energy photon emitted ( ideally ) simultaneously with a low energy photon",
    "is to be observed later than that low - energy photon .",
    "here we study the liv effect of the high energy photons in this direction .",
    "put differently , @xmath14 and @xmath15 have a different sign and , therefore , this positive correlation between the lag and the energy gradually becomes an anti - correlation .    in this work",
    ", we develop a new method through which a reasonable formulation of the intrinsic time delay can be derived , by fitting the energy dependence of the time lag .",
    "this allows us simultaneously to obtain robust limits on the 1st order and 2nd order qg energy scale .",
    "we describe the data analysis in section  [ sec : obser ] , and our methods and results are presented in section  [ sec : liv ] .",
    "our conclusions are briefly summarized in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "at @xmath16 ut on 2016 june 25 , the _ fermi _ gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ; @xcite ) triggered and located grb 160625b for the first time .",
    "then the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ; @xcite ) detected a sharp increase in the rate of high - energy photons at 22:43:24.82 ut , resulting in an onboard trigger on a bright pulse from the same grb . at 22:51:16.03 ut ,",
    "gbm triggered again on grb 160625b @xcite .",
    "the gamma - ray light curve of grb 160625b consists of three dramatically different isolated sub - bursts with a total duration of about @xmath17 s ( 15350 kev ; @xcite ) .",
    "the first sub - burst ( precursor ) that initially triggered the gbm is soft with a duration of about 0.84 s. the precursor is followed , corresponding to the lat trigger and starting at @xmath18 s , by the main , extremely bright and spectrally - hard episode with a duration of about 35.10 s. after a long waiting time ( @xmath19 s ) , the third sub - burst trigger gbm again which has a duration of about 212.22 s. spectroscopic observations reveals absorption features consistent with mg i , mg ii , mn ii and fe ii lines at a redshift of @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "since the second sub - burst of grb 160625b is very bright , we can easily extract its light curves in different energy bands ( see figure  [ f1 ] ) . in this analysis",
    ", we use the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) method to calculate the lags between light curves of different energies for intervals 180.6215.7 s of the burst .",
    "the detailed ccf method is described in @xcite .",
    "we look for spectral time lags in the light curves recorded in the lowest energy band ( 1012 kev ) relative to any other gbm light curves with higher energy bands , and find that the lag behavior is quite different .",
    "a transition from @xmath0 lags to @xmath1 lags is first discovered at @xmath21 mev ( see figure  [ f2 ] ) .",
    "the observed time lags we extract from the energy - dependent light curves are listed in table  [ table1 ] , together with their energy bands .",

    "as mentioned above , the liv - induced time lag @xmath15 may be accompanied by an unknown intrinsic energy - dependent time lag @xmath14 caused by the unknown emission mechanism of grbs . here",
    "we propose , for the first time , that the contributions of both the intrinsic time lag and the liv effects can result in a lag behavior with a transition from @xmath0 lags to @xmath1 lags . due to the fact that the dominant fraction of grb light curves show @xmath0 lags ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ", we suggest that there is a positive correlation between the intrinsic time lag and the energy . as the liv effect takes the lead at the high energy scales , this positive correlation trends in an opposite way .      in the observer frame",
    ", we assume the intrinsic positive time lag ( between the lowest energy band and any other high energy bands ) increases with the energy @xmath24 in the form of an approximate power - law function : @xmath25\\;{\\rm s } \\ ; , \\label{eq : tint}\\ ] ] with @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 kev is the median value of the fixed lowest energy band ( 1012 kev ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath29 and the index @xmath30 are free parameters , which must be optimized simultaneously with the qg energy scale @xmath5 ( more on this below ) .",
    "we emphasize that a @xmath0 lag corresponds to an earlier arrival time for the higher energy emission in this study .      in qg scenarios ,",
    "the liv induced modifications to the photon dispersion relation can be expressed by the leading term of the taylor expansion as @xmath31\\ ; , \\label{eq : dispersion}\\ ] ] which corresponds to a photon propagation speed @xmath32\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath5 denotes the qg energy scale , the @xmath33-th order expansion of the leading term corresponds to the linear ( @xmath22 ) or quadratic ( @xmath23 order ) , and @xmath34 is the  sign \" of the liv effect ( @xmath35 or @xmath36 stands for a decrease or an increase in photon velocity with an increasing photon energy ) . in the case of @xmath35 , photons with higher energies would travel slower than those with lower energies in vacuum .",
    "this predicts a @xmath1 spectral lag due to liv , so we consider the @xmath35 case in the following .    because of the energy dependence of the photon speed , two photons with different energies ( denoted by @xmath24 and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 ) emitted simultaneously from the same source would arrive on earth at different times .",
    "taking into account the cosmological expansion , the liv induced time delay is given by @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the arrival times of the low energy photon and the high energy photon , respectively . here",
    "we use the cosmological parameters determined by the @xmath42 observations : @xmath43 km @xmath44 @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .      with the 37 lag  energy measurements ( see table  [ table1 ] and figure  [ f2 ] ) , from equations  ( [ eq : tobs ] , [ eq : tint ] , and [ eq : tliv ] ) , we perform a global fitting to determine the free parameters ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath5 ) simultaneously using the monte carlo ( mc ) approach .",
    "a fitting engine ( @xmath48 ) has been developed , which employs a bayesian mc fitting technique to realistically fit free parameters that are constrained by the observed data even when other parameters are unconstrained . with the help of this technique ,",
    "the best - fit parameters and their uncertainties can be reliably determined by the converged mc chains .",
    "we first fit the observed lag  energy data with the linear liv case ( i.e. , @xmath22 ) .",
    "the resulting constraints on @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath6 are shown in figure  [ f3 ] .",
    "these contours show that at the @xmath49 level , the best - fit parameter values are @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , with a @xmath53 .",
    "next , we consider the quadratic liv case ( i.e. , @xmath23 ) to fit the observed lag  energy data .",
    "the parameter constraints are displayed in figure  [ f4 ] .",
    "we see here that the best - fit corresponds to @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 . with @xmath57 degrees of freedom",

    "it has been proposed that liv could be the origin of the threshold anomalies @xcite .",
    "that is , the liv scenario could be tested not only by the study of spectral lags but also by analysis of data on such threshold anomalies .",
    "the limits on liv from the threshold anomalies are at a level well beyond the sensitivity of the analysis reported in this paper ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "on the other hand , it is well known that threshold anomalies do not apply to the dsr scenario ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these results on threshold anomalies would imply that the analysis of spectral lags reported in this paper would not carry much weight on the debate concerning liv ( since more stringent limits may be established via the threshold anomalies ) , being instead a more valuable contribution to the debate on the dsr scenario .",
    "the observed spectral lags of grbs have been widely used to constrain the energy scales of liv .",
    "the key issue in the idea of searching for spectral lags , however , is to distinguish the possible time delay induced by the liv effect from any source - intrinsic time lag in the emission of photons at different energies . in order to overcome the intrinsic time lag problem",
    ", @xcite proposed a data fitting procedure to test the liv effect , and an unknown constant was assumed to be the intrinsic time lag in the linear fitting function , and furthermore assuming that all grbs have the same intrinsic time lag .    here , instead of assuming an unknown constant for the intrinsic time lag",
    ", we argue that the intrinsic lag has a positive dependence on the photon energy . on the other hand , the liv effects which are expected at high energy scales would make high energy photons travel in vacuum slower than low energy photons , so we suggest that the positive correlation between the lag and the energy will gradually become an anti - correlation at the high energy scales . in this work , we successfully fit the evolving behavior of the spectral lags of grb 160625b ( i.e. , the existence of a transition from @xmath0 lags to @xmath1 lags ) , by considering the contributions of both the intrinsic time lag and the lag by the liv effect .",
    "this is the first time , to our knowledge , that it has been possible to give both a reasonable formulation of the intrinsic energy - dependent time lags and robust limits on liv through direct fitting of the spectral lag data of a grb .",
    "our limit on the linear liv case ( @xmath2 gev ) obtained here from the spectral lags is comparable to the limit found from @xcite with an unknown constant for the intrinsic time lag , being less than three orders of magnitude below the planck energy scale .",
    "our limit on the quadratic liv case ( @xmath3 gev ) is four orders of magnitude below the current best limit from the single gev photon of grb 090510 @xcite .",
    "while the spectral lags of grb 160625b do not currently have the best sensitivity to liv constraints , there is nonetheless merit to the result .",
    "firstly , because the true spectral time lags of broad light curves in different energy multi - photon bands are used to obtain reliable constraints on liv , rather than the rough time lags obtained from a single gev photon . secondly , because the analysis of the intrinsic time lag performed here is important for studying the flight time differences from the astronomical sources to test the liv effect , since it impacts the reliability of the resulting constraints on liv . compared with previous works , the problems associated with the intrinsic time lags can be obviously handled better with our new method .",
    "furthermore , it is reasonable to expect that grb 160625b is not the only burst where a transition from @xmath0 to @xmath1 lags can be determined , and the method presented here can be used for any burst with similar lag features .",
    "more stringent constraints on liv can be expected as our method is applied to larger numbers of grbs with higher temporal resolutions and more high energy photons .",
