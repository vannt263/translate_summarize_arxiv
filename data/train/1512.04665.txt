    "then numerous groups have developed sophisticated techniques to perform calculations allowing the description of rotational bands for very elongated shapes .",
    "the phenomenon of superdeformation constitutes a spectacular manifestation of the mean - field properties of nuclei .    the change of shape of nuclei and other properties of nuclear structure with neutron number has attracted much theoretical and experimental attention for many years  @xcite .",
    "the conditions needed for the observation of shapes coexisting in such nuclei have been a matter of challenge and theoretically calculated by patra and panda  @xcite in 1993 .",
    "the change of shapes of pt isotopes was studied by sharma and ring  @xcite .",
    "the shapes of nuclei such as os and pt have also been studied by using the hartree - fock bogoliubov ( hfb ) formalism within the non - relativistic framework  @xcite .",

    "@xcite studied the shape co - existence in zr isotopes .    the nuclei with @xmath6 consists of both rare earth metals(yb ) as well as the transition metals(hf , w , os , pt , hg ) .",
    "they manifest a lot of interesting phenomena like shape co - existence , change of shape in an isotopic chain etc  @xcite . in this region of the atomic number , variety of shapes such as prolate , oblate and spherical configuration of nuclei appears in ground state@xcite .",
    "many theoretical as well as experimental papers have focused their interest on the shape transition  @xcite , shape isomerism and the observation of superdeformed bands  @xcite in neutron - deficient hg isotopes .",
    "the aim of this manuscript is to explore the neutron rich side of the concerned mass region with rmf formalism .",
    "mainly the structure informations like deformation , two neutron separation energy , single particle energy levels etc . have been extracted using nl3 force parameter .",
    "further , @xmath7 decay has been remained a very powerful tool to study the nuclear structure since its discovery by becquerel in 1896 .",
    "we also find other exotic decay modes like @xmath5 decay , spontaneous fission , cluster - decay etc .",

    ". this force parameter set is successful in both @xmath5-stable and drip - line nuclei .",
    "the lagrangian contained the term of interaction between meson and nucleon and also self - interaction of isoscalar - scalar _ sigma _ meson .",

    "the photon field @xmath8 is included to take care of coulombic interaction of protons .",
    "the pairing correlation is taken care by using bcs approach  @xcite .",
    "we start with the relativistic lagrangian density for a nucleon - meson many - body system , @xmath9 here sigma meson field is denoted by @xmath10 , omega meson field by @xmath11 and rho meson field is denoted by @xmath12 . in the equations",

    "a definite set of coupled equations are obtained from the above lagrangian and solved self - consistently in an axially deformed harmonic oscillator basis .",
    "the total energy of the system is given by the expression ,    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the sum of the single - particle energies of the nucleons and @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 are the contributions of the meson field , the coulomb field and the pairing energy respectively .",
    "the center of mass ( c.m . ) motion energy correction is estimated by the harmonic oscillator formula @xmath29 mev , where @xmath30 is the mass number of the nucleus .",
    "the total quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath31 and hexadecoupole parameter @xmath32 of the nucleus can be obtained from the quadrupole moment @xmath33 and hexadecoupole moment @xmath34 , respectively using the relations @xmath35 where r is the nuclear radius . the root mean square ( rms ) matter radius",

    "as we know , if we go near the neutron drip line , then coupling to the continuum become important  @xcite . in this case the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( rhb ) approach  @xcite has been proved to be a more accurate formalism for this region .",
    "however in case of rmf - bcs formalism also , the pairing constants along with nl3 parameters are adjusted so that it can reproduce the bulk properties of a nucleus near the drip line region .",
    "for example , in fig .",

    "it is evident from the figure that the binding energy from our calculation is in a nice agreement with frdm and experimental results in neutron rich region .",
    "further , our present result agrees acceptably well with the available rhb data . by using bcs pairing correlation model ,",
    "it has been shown earlier by different groups  @xcite that the results from relativistic mean field bcs ( rmf - bcs ) approach is almost similar with the rhb formalism .",
    "however due to the lack of nl3-rhb data in neutron rich region for the concerned isotopes , we are unable to compare their individual merits , but the above figure and references suggest that the present formalism can be extended in neutron rich region .          in order to choose the proper basis , we calculate the physical observables like binding energy , root mean square(rms ) radii and quadrupole deformation parameter(@xmath52 ) .",
    "to select optimal values for @xmath53 and @xmath54 , we select @xmath55yb and @xmath56hg as test case and increase the basis quanta from 8 to 20 step by step in fig .",

    "but our calculation is extended far beyond the stability line which demands a comparatively large basis space for calculation .",

    "the parameter @xmath31 is directly connected to the shape of the nucleus .",
    "the ground state quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath31 is plotted in fig .",
    "we have compared our rmf results with frdm  @xcite results .    in case of yb isotopes in fig .",

    "again it changes to prolate state . in lower and higher mass region ,",
    "maximum isotopes are prolate in shape . in the middle region , these changes to oblate shape .",
    "therefore one can say that , in yb isotopes , at @xmath63 and @xmath67 , there is a shape transition from oblate to highly prolate .",
    "frdm also shows the same trend in shapes .",
    "the same trend is found in other isotopes except mercury ( hg ) .",
    "mercury shows prolate shape at @xmath68 whereas frdm shows oblate shape in the same region .",
    "the two - neutron separation energy @xmath69(n , z ) = be(n , z ) - be(n-2 , z ) is shown in fig .",

    "we can predict the stability of these nuclei by @xmath69 energy .",
    "if @xmath69 is large , it means nuclei will be stable with two - neutron separation whereas the two neutron drip line for an isotopic chain can be identified as the nucleus having zero or slightly positive separation energy value .",
    "therefore , it is evident from the figure that the two neutron drip line for the @xmath70(yb ) isotope comes at @xmath71 , the same for @xmath72 isotopes is approximately at @xmath2 . in case of @xmath73(hg ) , the two neutron drip line arrives at the neutron number @xmath74 .",
    "furthermore , in all cases , the @xmath69 values decrease gradually with increase in neutron number .",
    "there is a kink appeared at neutron magic number @xmath75 in every cases . in order to visualize this scenario with a bit clarity , in the next subsection , we defined differential variation of two - neutron separation energy given in fig .",

    "@xcite and  @xcite respectively . in general , the large , sharp , deep fall in the @xmath76(z , n ) is observed for yb , hf , w , os , pt and hg isotopes at n=82 and 126 ( fig .",

    "[ single ] we plotted single particle energies for neutron levels near the fermi surface for hg isotopes ( @xmath73 ) at neutron shell closures ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "we have used deformed configuration to calculate these levels . from table [ hg ] , it is evident that @xmath79hg and @xmath80hg are nearly spherical and therefore the single particle levels are almost identical to that of the spherical configuration .",
    "for example , in @xmath79hg , the level g@xmath81 actually consists of four overlapped energy states having spins @xmath82 . in both cases , we found some large gaps at @xmath83 shell closures . here , the green dotted line shows the approximate fermi level . in case of yb ,",
