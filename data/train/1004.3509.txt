    "[ fig2 ] , is apparent .",
    "an analogy between this two  state approach to synchronization and the sis epidemiological model discussed in section [ sis ] can in turn be derived from the identification of the unsynchronized state with the susceptible state on one hand , and of the synchronized state and the infectious state on the other . with this identification ,",
    "the transitions us @xmath164 ss and us @xmath164 uu correspond , respectively , to contagion from the infectious partner and to the spontaneous recovery of an infectious agent . the rates @xmath7 and @xmath1 play the same role in both dynamical models , with the difference that in the sis model @xmath7 does not depend on the recombination rate .",
    "another difference is that the two  state approach to synchronization includes the transition uu @xmath164 ss , which in the sis model would correspond to simultaneous infection of two susceptible partners a forbidden event .",
    "the sis model , in turn , allows for the recovery of just one among two infectious partners , which would stand for the inexistent transition ss @xmath164 us .",
    "notwithstanding these differences , we realize that the plot of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] is the equivalent in the two  state approach to synchronization as the endemic threshold depicted in the insert of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] where both the infectivity @xmath7 and the recombination @xmath51 are normalized by the recovery probability @xmath1 .",
    "the two thresholds have qualitatively the same functional dependence on the respective parameter . in addition",
    ", the transition to full synchronization in our two  state formulation is a transcritical bifurcation , the same kind of critical phenomenon as in the sis model .",
    "we have here studied two critical phenomena in the collective behaviour of large ensembles of interacting dynamical elements namely , the appearance of endemic states in an sis epidemiological model , and the stabilization of full synchronization of identical chaotic maps when the corresponding interaction patterns are highly disconnected and , concurrently , change with time .",
    "specifically , we have considered  ` monogamous' interaction patterns , represented by networks where each site is connected to only one neighbour at a time , but such that neighbours can be exchanged at random at a specified rate . while in the absence of neighbour exchange or , as we have called it , of recombination the occurrence of endemic states and synchronization would be impossible due to the lack of connectivity in the ensemble , sufficiently frequent recombination events make it possible that coherence is established all over the system , thus allowing for organized collective dynamics .",
    "recombination of interacting couples in a monogamous pattern introduces a new dynamical parameter the recombination rate . the two critical phenomena studied here",
    "take now place upon variation of this parameter : endemic states and full synchronization occur above a certain critical value of the recombination rate .",
    "moreover , for the sis epidemiological model with a given infectivity , we have found that the limit of infinitely large recombination rate is equivalent to the situation where the interaction pattern is static but not disconnected .",
    "for chaotic maps , on the other hand , the fact that time elapses by discrete steps imposes a limit to the recombination rate : any interacting couple can at most be recombined once per step .",
    "this establishes in turn an upper limit for the lyapunov coefficient of individual maps such that they can be synchronized by recombination .",
    "if the maps are `` too chaotic '' , synchronization is not possible even at the maximal rate of one recombination per couple per time step .",
    "the fact that , instantaneously , each dynamical element of the two ensembles considered here has just only one interaction partner , makes the corresponding problems analytically tractable to a large extent . in particular , we have obtained analytical approximations for the critical values of the recombination rate which are in very good agreement with numerical results . for sis epidemics ,",
    "the critical recombination rate was found both from the integration over the whole population of the epidemiological dynamics within each couple , and from the dynamics of the number of couples in each epidemiological state .",
    "for the chaotic maps , we have replaced this latter approach by a kind of symbolic schematic representation of the dynamics of couples . in this representation , which can also be adapted to the sis model and qualitatively reproduces the critical behaviour of the two systems , maps ( or epidemiological agents ) are though of as two  state elements .",
    "their interactions induce transitions between the two states following a small set of intuitive rules .",
    "we conjecture that this kind of representation is capturing the essential mechanisms that govern the relative prevalence of unsynchronized / susceptible elements at one side of the critical point , and of synchronized / infectious elements at the other .",
    "collective dynamics on monogamous interaction patterns have the advantage of analytical tractability .",
    "it should however be borne in mind that these patterns represent a kind of extreme case among disconnected networks : they have the minimal number of links that avoids isolated elements .",
    "networks with less severe lack of connectivity should impose lower limitations to the development of collective self - organized behaviour . in these cases , therefore , we expect that recombination , even at lower rates , will also be able to compensate the lack of connectivity , triggering critical phenomena such as those studied here ."
