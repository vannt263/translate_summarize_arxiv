    "statistics of large fluctuations of current in non - equilibrium steady states of diffusive lattice gases has become a central topic of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "the  standard model \" here involves a lattice gas between two heat baths kept at different temperatures , or between two reservoirs of particles at different densities .",
    "most of the works on this subject assumed one - dimensional geometry .",
    "it is interesting to see what new effects high dimensions can bring @xcite .",
    "here we consider a simple setting which can be studied in arbitrary dimension .",
    "suppose an infinite lattice gas of density @xmath0 is brought in contact with an immobile macroscopic ( for simplicity , spherical ) absorber .",
    "the gas particles are absorbed immediately when they hit the absorber .",
    "here there is only one reservoir : the absorber which enforces a zero gas density in its vicinity .",
    "this simple setting has a long history .",
    "it was originally suggested by smoluchowski @xcite as a minimalistic model of diffusion - controlled binary chemical reactions ( where the absorber mimics a very large particle of the minority species ) .",
    "the average particle flux into the absorber mimics the reaction rate @xcite .",
    "here we are interested in large fluctuations of the particle flux , and the two main questions we ask are the following :    * what is the probability distribution @xmath2 that @xmath3 particles are absorbed during a very long time @xmath4 ? (",
    "the long - time limit is achieved when @xmath4 becomes much greater than the characteristic diffusion time determined by the absorber radius and the gas diffusivity . )",
    "* what is the most probable density history of the gas , conditional on the absorption of @xmath3 particles during the time @xmath4 ?",
    "the special case of @xmath5 ( all the gas particles survive until time @xmath4 ) , corresponds to the celebrated _ survival _ problem .",
    "this problem , and its extensions , have been extensively studied in the past @xcite .",
    "most of these studies assumed that the gas is composed of non - interacting brownian particles in a continuous space , or non - interacting random walkers ( rws ) on a lattice .",
    "an account of interactions between the particles ( which is important , for example , in crowded environments such as a living cell @xcite ) makes the problem much harder .",
    "recently , the survival problem with interactions has been addressed in ref .",

    "large - scale fluctuations in these gases are described by the langevin equation @xmath16 + \\nabla \\cdot \\left[\\sqrt{\\sigma(n ) }       \\,\\text{\\boldmath$\\eta$ } ( \\mathbf{x},t)\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is a zero - mean gaussian noise , delta - correlated in space and in time @xcite .",
    "as one can see , the coarse - grained description of the fluctuations includes an additional transport coefficient , @xmath18 .",
    "this coefficient comes from the shot noise of the microscopic model , and it is equal to twice the mobility of the gas @xcite .    here",
    "we considerably extend upon the previous work by investigating the full absorption statistics of particles in diffusive lattice gases , and by providing answers to the two main questions formulated above .",
    "the long - time absorption statistics can be conveniently described by the macroscopic fluctuation theory ( mft ) of bertini , de sole , gabrielli , jona - lasinio , and landim .",
