    "unquestionably , the calculation of the scaling exponents that characterize correlation functions in turbulence is one of the coveted goals of nonlinear statistical physics . in a recent paper @xcite , hereafter referred to as paper i , a formal scheme to achieve such a calculation was outlined . in the present paper",
    "we discuss the first order steps of this scheme , identify the mechanism for anomalous scaling in turbulence , and discuss the series of steps available if one wants to improve the numerical values of the computed anomalous exponents .",
    "the main ideas how to achieve the lowest order closure without breaking the rescaling symmetry of the euler equation are formulated such that they repeat essentially unchanged in any higher order closure ; it seems that no new ideas are necessary .    to set up the developments of this paper , we present now a short review of some essential ideas and results .",

    "this is first aim of a statistical theory of turbulence_.    one could assume that also the time correlation functions @xmath24 are homogeneous functions of their arguments , including the time arguments .",
    "it should be stressed that this is not the case , and that in the context of turbulence , when the exponents @xmath0 are anomalous , dynamical scaling is broken .",

    "@xcite it was shown that the scaling properties of the time correlation functions can be parametrized conveniently with the help of one scalar function @xmath31 . to understand this presentation , consider first the simultaneous function @xmath32 . following the standard ideas of multi - fractals @xcite the simultaneous function can be represented as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a typical velocity scale , and greek coordinates stand for dimensionless ( rescaled ) coordinates , i.e. @xmath35 in eq .",

    "our presentation of @xmath1th order objects on the  @xmath41-slice \" in terms of lower order ones is also exact , it just _ defines _ at the @xmath1th step of the procedure a group of @xmath114th new vertices .",

    "= 8.6truecm 0.1 cm = 8.6truecm 0.1 cm = 8.6truecm 0.5 cm    it would be only fair to say that the idea for this procedure came from a careful examination of the fully renormalized perturbation theory for this problem , @xcite . in that procedure one can _ derive _ equations for the @xmath117 order objects that appear symbolically like figs .  [ f4]a , [ f4]b . etc .",
    "in addition , one can at each step of the procedure have an infinite expansion for the irreducible contributions .",
    "nevertheless , the procedure explained above is different ; firstly , it is consistently developed on an ",
    "@xmath41-slice \" , whereas the renormalized perturbation theory is done for the standard statistical objects .",
    "secondly , at no point is there any infinite expansion whose convergence properties are dubious .",
    "we just go through a set of explicit definitions solving an exact set of equations .",
    "the only question that needs to be understood is the speed of convergence of this scheme in terms of the scalar function @xmath31 which parametrizes the anomalous behavior .",
    "a crucial property of our closure procedure is that it guarantees that power counting remains irrelevant on an  @xmath41-slice \" for an arbitrary step of the procedure , and the scalar function @xmath31 can not be computed from power counting . to see this we need to find the rescaling properties of the triple and higher order vertices .",
    "we start with the triple vertices @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 . the first one",
    "is defined by its relation to @xmath99 , see fig .",
    "[ f3]b . using the facts that @xmath118",
    "we find that @xmath94 has to transform according to @xmath119 armed with this knowledge we proceed to the definition of @xmath95 through its relation to @xmath98 , equation in fig .",
    "we can check that the rescaling property of @xmath120 agrees exactly with the two terms that contain the vertex @xmath94 on the rhs . accordingly",
    "also the term containing @xmath95 has to transform in the same way , leading to @xmath121 in making this assertion we assumed that there is no cancellation of the leading terms in the equation .",
    "otherwise the vertex @xmath95 would be smaller .",
    "lastly we use the definition of @xmath96 by the relation to @xmath97 , see fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , that transforms like @xmath122 all the terms that include @xmath94 and @xmath95 have the same rescaling exponent as that of @xmath123 . we can therefore find the rescaling exponent of @xmath96 :",
    "we again assumed that there is no cancellation of the leading terms in the equation for @xmath97 .",
    "if there is cancellation , the vertex @xmath96 can be smaller .    at this point",
    "we can check that the first step in our closure scheme leads to a @xmath31 covariant procedure .",
    "consider firstly the three contributions of gaussian decomposition which are first on the rhs of the equation in fig .",
    "these rescale like @xmath125 , and their ratio to the lhs is proportional to @xmath126 . for @xmath31",
    "positive these contributions become irrelevant in the limit @xmath127 .",
    "the 45 contributions that come next contain pairs of triple vertices , and we need to use the rescaling properties ( [ rescalea ] ) , ( [ rescaleb ] ) , and ( [ rescalec ] ) to find their rescaling exponents .",
    "we find that they _ all share the same rescaling exponent _ . in hindsight",
    "this should not be surprising .",
    "this is a result of the _ assumption _ that in the definitions of the three vertices there are no cancellations in the leading scaling behavior .",
    "thus the rescaling exponent of all the 45 contributions could be obtained from analyzing one of them .",
    "the nontrivial fact is that the common rescaling of all these terms is exactly the rescaling of the lhs of the equation , which is @xmath128 .",
    "this means that our closure for the 4th order correlation functions can not introduce power counting .",
    "note that the rescaling neutrality with respect to counting of @xmath41 and of natural numbers follows from the rescaling symmetry of the euler equation , and is shared also by gaussian contributions . on the other hand",
    "the neutrality with respect to @xmath31 is nontrivial , and follows from a judicious choice of the proposed closure scheme",
    ". we will refer this property as @xmath44-covariance .",
    "it is important to understand now that the proposed closures for the other 4th order objects , like fig .",
    "[ f4]b are also @xmath44-covariant .",
    "all that changes is the number of wavy and straight tails on the lhs and rhs of the equations , and the rescaling exponents change in the same way on the two sides of the equation .",
    "we can now consider the next step of closure , taking into account the irreducible 4th order vertices ( empty squares ) , discarding the 5th order empty pentagons ( irreducible contributions , for details , see paper 1 the procedure follows verbatim the one described above for the triple vertices and the rescaling exponents of the irreducible 4th order vertices @xmath129 are determined : @xmath130 we can check the terms that appear in the 5th order correlation and green s functions , which are made of combinations of triple and 4th order vertices .",
    "we discover that all these terms share the same rescaling exponent , and that it agrees precisely with the rescaling of the 5th order correlation and green s function . accordingly",
    "also the second step of closure is @xmath44-covariant .",
    "it becomes evident that we develop a systematic @xmath44-covariant closure scheme , and that power counting will not creep in at any step of the procedure . in the next section",
    "we show that the scalar function @xmath31 can be computed from this scheme as a generalized eigenvalue .",
    "we also explain the role of the boundary conditions in the space of scales , and how the re - normalization scale is chosen .",
    "in this section we demonstrate that at any step of our closure , the scalar function @xmath31 can be found only from a solvability condition .",
    "we will also explain the role of the boundary conditions in the space of scales in determining the scaling functions in this theory .",
    "the point is really rather simple .",
    "first observe that our initial equations for correlation and green s functions on an  @xmath41-slice \" , like ( [ greater ] ) or ( [ g2 - 1])-([g1 - 2 ] ) are _ linear _ functional equations .",
    "the equations for the correlation functions are not only linear , but also homogeneous .",
    "the equations for the green s functions are not all homogeneous , but as we explained in the last section the inhomogeneous terms are much smaller than the homogeneous terms in the limit @xmath127 , and they can be discarded .",
    "this means , of course , that all the functions on an ",
    "@xmath41-slice \" can be determined only up to an over all numerical constant . at this point",
    "we may have even more than one overall free constant ; on the face of it the equations for the correlation functions are independent of the equations for the green s functions , and we can have different overall constants in the correlation and the green s functions .",
    "every step of closure turns a set of linear functional equations into a set of nonlinear functional equations .",
    "we claim that nevertheless all the functions appearing in these equations can be determined only up to an overall numerical constant .",
    "the extra freedom of many possible constants disappears now , since the correlation and the green s functions are coupled after closure .",
    "but one overall constant remains free .",
    "the reason is of course the property of @xmath44-covariance , which includes as a special case invariance to an overall scaling factor , or rescaling by @xmath131 .",
    "if our equations were linear , this freedom would have meant that we need to require the standard solvability condition that the linear operator had an eigenvalue zero , and the functions that we seek would have been identified as the  zero - modes \" associated with this eigenvalue .",
    "our equations are not linear , and the solvability condition is not that simple .",
    "nevertheless we know apriori that at every step of the closure we will need to find the solvability condition of the nonlinear set of equations , and this condition will determine the numerical value of @xmath31 .    even after determining @xmath31 the statistical functions will be determined only up to a factor which may depend on @xmath41 , which is the measure @xmath132 in eqs([repres ] ) and ( [ represg ] ) . in order to determine this factor",
    "we will need to fit all correlation functions @xmath23 to the boundary conditions in the space of scales . at that point",
    "the computed values of @xmath31 will determine whether it is the inner or the outer scale of turbulence that appears as the renormalizaiton scale .",
    "we will show in the lowest step of closure that the outer scale @xmath2 is selected .",
    "up to now we described the general ideas and how the closure scheme should work .",
    "the main point of the analysis is that the equations of motion of the statistical objects admit an exact rescaling group that contains , for a given  @xmath41-slice \" , one unknown scalar function @xmath31 whose calculation is sufficient for the evaluation of the scaling exponents @xmath0 via eq .",
    "( [ znzh ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , the actual calculations that are called for in this scheme are far from trivial . in the lowest step of closure",
    "we are faced with five coupled integro - differential equations in many space - time variables , and the complexity increases rapidly in the higher steps of closure .",
    "we are currently attempting to solve numerically the lowest step of closure with the aim of _ demonstrating _ the existence of anomalous scaling .",

    "<S> the closure procedure is constructed to respect the fundamental rescaling symmetry of the euler equation . </S>",
    "<S> the starting point of the procedure is an infinite hierarchy of coupled equations that are obeyed identically with respect to scaling for any set of scaling exponents @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this hierarchy was discussed in detail in a recent publication [ v.s . lvov and i. procaccia , phys . </S>",

    "<S> the scaling exponents in this set of equations _ can not _ be found from power counting . in this draft </S>",
    "<S> we discuss in detail low order non - trivial closures of this infinite set of equations , and prove that these closures lead to the determination of the scaling exponents from solvability conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the equations under consideration after this closure are _ nonlinear _ integro - differential equations , reflecting the nonlinearity of the original navier - stokes equations . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless they have a very special structure such that the determination of the scaling exponents requires a procedure that is very similar to the solution of _ linear _ homogeneous equations , in which amplitudes are determined by fitting to the boundary conditions in the space of scales . the re - normalization scale that is necessary for any anomalous scaling appears at this point . </S>",
    "<S> the hlder inequalities on the scaling exponents select the renormalizaiton scale as the outer scale of turbulence @xmath2 .    .#1 </S>"
