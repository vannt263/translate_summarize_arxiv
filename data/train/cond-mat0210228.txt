    "pentacene has recently gained interest as a molecular conductor with a very high electronic mobility .",
    "mobilities of 1  @xmath1/vs were reported at 300k , increasing to 10@xmath2  @xmath1/vs at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "moreover , evidence for superconductivity up to 2  k in field effect devices was reported @xcite .",
    "we study the origin of this high mobility and its relation with the crystal structure , _",
    "i.e. _ the stacking of the molecules . the crystal structure and growth of pentacene",
    "has been subject of a number of studies @xcite .",
    "pentacene crystallizes in a layered structure with a herringbone arrangement within the layers , see fig .",
    "[ fig : penta ] .",
    "the layer periodicity , @xmath0(001 ) ,    is by far the largest repeat unit , and thus characteristic of the structure . in the early sixties , campbell _ et al . _",
    "determined the single crystal structure using a film method @xcite .",
    "these results were slightly modified @xcite , but yielded both a characteristic @xmath0(_001 _ ) value of 14.4   . in 1991",
    "et al . _ reported on the growth and crystal structure of thin films @xcite . they reported for thin films @xmath0(_001_)-spacings of 15.0 and 15.4   .",
    "it was only noticed by dimitrakopoulos _",
    "_ @xcite that these thin film polymorphs must be different from the single crystal .",
    "they also observed for the first time the coexistence of two phases , of 14.4 and 15.4   .",
    "the growth of these polymorphs was studied by schoonveld _",
    "these phases are generally referred to as the `` single crystal '' and `` thin film '' phase .",
    "we argue the former name to be incorrect as more recent redeterminations of the single crystal structure by holmes _",
    "@xcite , siegrist _",
    "_ @xcite and by us @xcite show the single crystal @xmath0(_001 _ ) value to be 14.1   . apparently there exist several polymorphs of pentacene .",
    "identification of these pentacene polymorphs is especially important when the electronic properties are related to the crystal structure .",
    "recent band structure calculations show that the electronic properties depend strongly on the particular stacking of the molecules within the layers @xcite . in this paper",
    "we discuss how the various polymorphs can be made , and what their crystal structures are .",
    "we identify four different polymorphs and determine by x - ray and electron diffraction their unit cell parameters .",
    "of one of the polymorphs we determine the hole mobility , _ via _ space - charge - limited - current measurements on a single crystal .",
    "thin films of pentacene were prepared by evaporation in a high vacuum environment of 10@xmath3  mbar .",
    "the source material , pure pentacene was obtained from aldrich and not further purified .",
    "it was placed in a tantalum crucible and heated to 540  k. as substrate thermally oxidized silicon ( @xmath4-sio@xmath5 ) or kapton ( polyimide ) was used .",
    "the substrate temperature was measured with an al - cr thermocouple and the substrate could be heated or cooled .",
    "the evaporation rate of the sublimed material was monitored by a quartz oscillator and the layer thickness was determined using a dektak .",
    "the evaporation was kept constant at a low rate of 0.1  nm / sec to ensure crystallinity .",
    "a shutter allowed the evaporation rate to become stable before the substrate was exposed to the pentacene flow .",
    "single crystals of pentacene were grown using a vapour transport method @xcite .",
    "a pyrex tube was thoroughly cleaned by heating it under a stream of pure nitrogen gas .",
    "200 - 400  mg of unprocessed pentacene , obtained from aldrich , was placed at one end of the tube in a platinum crucible .",
    "the growth was performed either under a stream of nitrogen gas mixed with hydrogen gas , with a volume percentage of 5.1(1)% hydrogen , or under an argon flow .",
    "transport gases were obtained from aga with 5n purity for n@xmath6 and ar and 4n5 purity for h@xmath6 .",
    "great care was taken to avoid contamination with o@xmath6 and h@xmath6o .",
    "nitrogen and argon gases were further purified over activated copper and alumina columns .",
    "a temperature gradient was applied by resistively heating two heater coils wrapped around the tube .",
    "crystallization took place some 300  mm from the sublimation point at a temperature of approximately 490  k. single crystals were also grown from a solution of trichlorobenzene ( tcb ) .",
    "violet crystals were obtained by slowly ( four weeks ) evaporating the tcb at 450  k , under a stream of ultra pure nitrogen gas .",
    "the x - ray diffraction patterns of the obtained single crystals were measured with an enraf - nonius cad-4 or a bruker smart apex diffractometer .",
    "both diffractometers use monochromated mo - k@xmath7 radiation .",
    "the structures are solved using shelxs and shelxl @xcite .",
    "the x - ray diffraction patterns of pentacene thin films were measured using a d8 powder diffractometer of bruker a.g . in a bragg - brentano geometry , with monochromatic cu - k@xmath8 radiation . a variable temperature stage is used for in situ temperature dependent measurements between 100  k and 650  k , in a vacuum of 10@xmath9  mbar .",
    "the obtained spectra were analyzed using the topas software package @xcite .",
    "electron diffraction ( ed ) measurements were performed on a philips cm200/feg ( 200  kv ) transmission electron microscope . during the measurements",
    "the electron dose was held low , to prevent radiation damage of the samples .",
    "experiments were performed in the electron microscopy group of the department of biophysical chemistry in groningen and in the national centre for hrem in delft .",
    "in the literature different @xmath0(_00l _ ) values are reported for pentacene thin films @xcite . to investigate this ,",
    "we have grown thin films of pentacene , using different growth conditions . a typical x - ray diffraction pattern of a pentacene thin film is shown in fig .  [ fig : xraypoly ] .",

    "[ fig : xraypoly ] , parts of two diffraction patterns of two thin films , grown in different ways , are shown .",
    "we observe reflections centered at 5.80 , 5.92 , 6.19 and 6.33 degrees 2@xmath12 .",
    "analysis of the entire spectra shows the reflections to correspond to @xmath0(_001 _ )  spacings of 14.1 , 14.4 , 15.0 and 15.4  .",
    "this result indicates that at least four polymorphs of pentacene are present in the various thin films .",

    "the 14.4    phase is observed above this critical thickness , and at an elevated substrate temperature .",
    "the fraction of this polymorph increases with the film thickness @xcite .",
    "we observe that this dependence on the substrate temperature and the film thickness also holds for the 15.0 and 14.1    polymorphs . here , the 15.0    polymorph is stable for small film thicknesses and low substrate temperatures .",
    "typical growth conditions to obtain single - phased films are listed in table  [ tbl : thinfilms ] .",
    "we have grown single phased films of the 15.0 and 15.4    phases at ambient temperature with a film thickness of approximately 50  nm , on a kapton and @xmath4-sio@xmath5 substrate , respectively .",

    "we have no explanation for this difference and neglect it .",
    "the 14.4    phase was present , as an observed @xmath17 value ( ed2 ) indicates the presence of this polymorph .",
    "the third set of parameters observed in our ed experiments ( ed3 ) is in good agreement with the values observed by minakata _",
    "et al_. however , their reported @xmath18 value was measured on a sample grown under the same conditions , but on a different substrate . since we observed the nature of the substrate to be of crucial importance to the growth of a specific polymorph , we omit their reported value of @xmath18 .",
    "ed4 in table [ tbl : struc ] lists a third set of @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 values .",
    "these sets of data , ed3 and ed4 , will belong to the 15.0 and 15.4    polymorphs .    in these experiments the electron beam was perpendicular to the substrate .",
    "by tilting the sample other reciprocal lattice vectors can be brought in diffraction condition .",
    "if sufficient _ hkl _ spots are identified , the unit cell can be constructed .",
    "however , the tilting may not change the small single crystalline area under study .",
    "presently , tilting did affect the sample position , and we could not ascertain that the diffraction pattern belonged to the same polymorph . furthermore , after a short exposure to the electron beam , the material suffered from radiation damage .",
    "future modifications of the apparatus will allow to tilt the sample while keeping the same crystal in the beam .",
