    "ic  5181 is a member of the loose ngc  7213 group .",
    "it forms a pair with the edge - on spiral galaxy ngc  7232a at @xmath5 separation corresponding to a projected linear distance of 58.4 kpc .    in the framework of acquisition events occurred in the lifetime of galaxies , we present ic  5181 as a new case of a disk galaxy characterized by a geometric and kinematic orthogonal decoupling between its stellar body and the ionized - gas component .",

    "the h@xmath1 image of the galaxy shows an ionized gas structure perpendicular to the stellar disk of ic  5181 .",
    "the disk and bulge are featureless and regular as expected for an s0 galaxy .",
    "the only noticeable fact is the change in position angle ( @xmath9 ) of the isophotes around @xmath10 and that the disk is edge - on ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the kinematics of the stellar component show no anomalies .",
    "the ionized gas is instead moving on polar orbits and its extension along the minor axis is twice the extension along the major axis .",
    "we interpret these results as the indication that ic  5181 has a central triaxial structure ( a bar or a bulge ) and that the ionized gas is moving onto a plane perpendicular to its long axis . to check",
    "if this picture is consistent with the observations , we build a geometric model of the galaxy .",
    "we derived its asymptotic circular velocity from the stellar kinematics finding @xmath12 @xmath13 .",
    "we measure a projected asymptotic velocity of the ionized gas of @xmath14 @xmath15 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : kin ] , right panel ) . assuming that the ionized gas is moving with the same @xmath16 as the stars",
    ", we derive its inclination : @xmath17 .",
    "the two angles describing the orientation of the galaxy are therefore known : the inclination of the stellar disk @xmath11 and the inclination of the ionized gas @xmath18 .",
    "the direction of the angular momentum of the gas can be found and it lies along @xmath19 .",
    "this is consistent with the orientation of the ionized gas seen in the h@xmath1 image ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phot ] , right panel ) .",
    "if the gas is orbiting in the equilibrium plane perpendicular to the long axis of a triaxial structure , @xmath20 is also the position angle of this structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a scheme of the geometric model can be found in fig .",
    "[ fig : modgeo ] .",
    "the small difference ( @xmath21 ) between the position angles of the disk major axis and bulge / bar long axis and the high inclination have prevented to decompose it properly in a two - dimensional surface photometry analysis .",
    "the kinematical decoupling between the gaseous and stellar components suggests the occurrence of an accretion event or merging @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is straightforward to explain the existence of the orthogonally rotating gas in ic  5181 as the end result of the acquisition of external gas by the pre - existing galaxy .",
    "the nearby environment of ic  5181 shows no strong evidence of such an event .",
    "ic  5181 does not interact with its closest companion , ngc  7232a , and is one of the few galaxies of the ngc  7213 group to be undetected in @xcite . proved that the environment of galaxies that experienced past gas accretion do not appear statistically different from those of normal galaxies .",
    "in addition , the polar orientation of the ionized gas and its possible low metal content fits well with the scenario proposed for the formation of polar ring galaxies , where the gaseous ring is formed by the accretion of material from a cosmic filament @xcite .     and is oriented along @xmath22 .",
    "the ionized gas polar disk ( green circle ) is perpendicular to the stellar disk and has an inclination of @xmath23 .",
    "the ionized gas polar axis ( dashed line ) is aligned with the central triaxial structure along @xmath24 , only @xmath25 clockwise from the galaxy major axis . [",
