    "the cosmic  dark ages , \" stretching from the last scattering surface of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) at @xmath10 to the formation of the first luminous sources at @xmath0 , are one of the last frontiers for observational cosmology .",
    "the problem is the difficulty of finding any probes : because the intergalactic medium ( igm ) has mostly decoupled from the cmb , there is no background radiation field against which we can study it , and ( by definition ) there are no local light sources .",
    "this is unfortunate because , at least in principle , the physics of the dark ages is sufficiently simple that we can hope to understand it in detail .",
    "the only factors that enter are the cmb , the expanding universe , recombinations , compton scattering ( which couples the cmb to the igm ) , and gravitational growth  almost entirely in the linear regime .",
    "thus , the igm properties during the dark ages ( and especially its fluctuations ) constitute a strong test of fundamental cosmological parameters in an entirely analogous way to the cmb .",
    "conversely , if we take the physics as well - understood , probes of the dark ages would offer stringent tests of exotic physics .",
    "two examples are dark matter decay and annihilation .",
    "if either of these processes happen ( even for only a fraction of the dark matter ) , they could inject high - energy photons ( or other particles ) into the igm .",
    "these would then scatter and deposit some or all of their energy as ionizations and heat .",
    "an altered reionization history may affect the total optical depth and , as a consequence , the cmb power spectrum .",
    "decaying dark matter particles were in fact initially advocated as a possible explanation for the high optical depth detected in the first year of _ wmap _ data @xcite .",
    "such data allowed an upper limit on the energy injection rate and consequently on the decay time ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "( these constraints , and others mentioned throughout this paper , were obtained with the first - year _ wmap _ data , but we do not expect the newer data @xcite to improve them substantially given the many uncertainties on the various reionization processes affecting the total optical depth . )    however , the cmb is only affected if a substantial fraction of the cmb photons interact with the igm  or in other words if the optical depth to electron scattering is substantially altered by the decay products @xcite .",
    "compared to the igm temperatures of @xmath12@xmath13 at @xmath0@xmath1 , ionization requires a substantial energy input , and decays with long timescales ( or low energy injection rates ) can not be ruled out with the cmb .",
    "nevertheless , because the igm temperature is so small , these models can still significantly affect the thermal history of the igm @xcite and hence the history of star formation .",
    "a number of recent particle physics models motivate such scenarios ( see the discussion below in  [ particles ] ) .",
    "dark matter annihilation has also been considered recently , primarily as an explanation for gamma - ray sources in the local universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) . but any such scenario will also predict an annihilation background from encounters between igm particles ; because the physical density increases like @xmath14 , such events could be relatively common in the early universe and so affect the cmb @xcite .",
    "of course , these scenarios will continue to affect the igm throughout the dark ages as well .",
    "the 21 cm background can offer powerful constraints on dark matter decay and annihilation ( or indeed any exotic process that injects energy into the igm during the dark ages ) .",
    "the hyperfine level populations of the ground state of neutral hydrogen are determined through competition between absorption of ( and emission stimulated by ) cmb photons ( and possibly uv photons ) and collisions . since the igm is dense at high - redshifts ,",
    "collisions dominate , driving the level populations into equilibrium with the kinetic temperature of the gas . because the latter is colder than the cmb",
    ", the igm is a net absorber of cmb photons at @xmath0@xmath1 .",
    "thus , the 21 cm transition can be used to map fluctuations in the igm during the dark ages , offering a pristine probe of cosmology @xcite .",
    "previous work has emphasized the possibility of constraining the matter power spectrum with this tool @xcite .",
    "here we point out that the fundamental properties of the fluctuations  on all scales  depend sensitively on the thermal history ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "thus the 21 cm background can be used to constrain dark matter decay and annihilation .",
    "it is much more sensitive than the cmb to dark matter decay because ( i ) it depends on the thermal history , not just the ionized fraction , and ( ii ) it is directly sensitive to the late time behavior ( when most of the energy is injected ) .",
    "it is less useful for constraining annihilation scenarios because in that case a large fraction of the energy is injected at early times .",
    "the excess heating and ionization induced by dark matter decay and annihilation can also affect the chemistry of the igm .",
    "in the simple chemical environment of the primordial igm , their most important effect will be on the h@xmath9 abundance , which is significant because that molecule is an important coolant for low - temperature gas @xcite and is thought to play a key role in the formation of the first stars @xcite . unfortunately , the implications  and even magnitude  of any possible boost to early structure formation are controversial @xcite . here",
    ", we provide a more detailed look at @xmath15 formation and incorporate some hitherto neglected effects in the calculation .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we briefly review the physics of the 21 cm background in ",
    "[ 21 cm ] .",
    "we describe our simple model for dark matter decay and annihilation , and review some particle physics motivation , in  [ dm ] .",
    "we then present our results for the 21 cm background in  [ results ] and for the h@xmath9 abundance in  [ htwo ] .",
    "finally , we discuss their implications in  [ disc ] .    in our numerical calculations , we assume a cosmology with @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 ( with @xmath20 ) , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , consistent with the most recent measurements @xcite , although we have increased @xmath23 from the best - fit _ wmap _ value to improve agreement with weak lensing .",
    "we quote all distances in comoving units , unless otherwise specified .",
    "we review the relevant characteristics of the 21 cm transition here ; we refer the interested reader to ref .",

    "it is obvious that fluctuations in the density , temperature , ionized fraction , radiation background , and velocity all source fluctuations in the brightness temperature .",

    "the implications of dark matter decay ( and/or annihilation ) for the thermal and ionization histories of the igm have been considered by a number of authors @xcite . here",
    "we first review some particle physics scenarios that can affect the dark ages , and then we show how to compute the resulting igm histories .",
    "dark matter particles can ionize and heat the igm through either decay or annihilation .    for decay ,",
    "short lifetimes ( @xmath57 , with @xmath58 denoting the dark matter particle ) are disfavored , as they cause the cmb power spectra to disagree with existing data @xcite . on the other hand , particles with exceptionally long lifetimes , such as gravitinos with mass @xmath59@xmath60 ( and",
    "hence @xmath61 @xcite ) only affect the igm temperature at low redshift ( @xmath62 ) @xcite .",
    "we wish to consider particles with lifetimes in the range @xmath63@xmath64 .",
    "one such example is an axino with mass @xmath65@xmath66 ; positrons produced as their decay products could explain the 511 kev emission excess from the galactic center @xcite .",
    "axinos in this mass range have @xmath67@xmath68 .",
    "the ionized fraction produced by such particles is too low to be observable with the cmb @xcite , but the igm temperature departs from the standard case by @xmath69 and at @xmath70 is @xmath71 times higher , if energy transfer is perfectly efficient @xcite .",
    "however , in these particular models a detailed accounting of the interactions between decay products and the igm substantially decreases their effect and pushes it to lower redshifts @xcite .",
    "another possible candidate is a sterile neutrino with @xmath72@xmath73 .",
    "again , even for the highest mass in this range , the ionized fraction produced by these particles is small ( @xmath74 at @xmath75 ) , but the present - day igm temperature increases by several orders of magnitude ( although again the energy transfer is likely not perfectly efficient ; @xcite ) .",
    "although such a neutrino is unlikely to be the sole dark matter component @xcite , it may still constitute a non - negligible fraction of the dark matter .",
    "such neutrinos have decay times @xmath76 .",
    "decays of super - heavy dark matter particles ( @xmath77 ) have been considered as possible sources of reionization @xcite and also as a production mechanism for ultra - high energy cosmic rays @xcite . with such energetic particles , the precise ionization and heating",
    "strongly depend on the type of reactions assumed .",
    "two kinds of annihilating dark matter have been investigated in connection with non - standard reionization : neutralino annihilation ( e.g. @xcite ) , involving particles with @xmath78 , and light dark matter annihilation ( @xmath65@xmath79 @xcite ) .",
    "while the expected ionization fraction is small , it extends to high redshifts , greatly affecting the cmb power spectrum .",
    "these models can already be constrained with current cmb data and will be better constrained by future cmb polarization measurements @xcite . in the most reasonable models , the igm temperature can be several times larger than normally expected at @xmath80@xmath81 .",
    "the effects of light dark matter annihilation on cmb power spectra have also been considered .",
    "cmb data still allow models with small ionization fractions but with igm temperatures a few times larger than in the standard scenario ( e.g. , @xmath82 times larger at @xmath83 ; @xcite ) .      rather than examine each of these models individually , we will follow the method of ref .  , who presented a simple but general model for the effects of dark matter decay .",
    "we first suppose that the dark matter particle has a decay rate @xmath84 , so that the physical number density of particles is @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the comoving number density . in our calculations",
    "we will assume @xmath87 , so that the exponential factor can be ignored . while not strictly necessary",
    ", this is probably the most interesting case ( because otherwise the decaying particle could not serve as the dark matter we see around us today ) and serves to illustrate the basic results .",
    "the total comoving emissivity is then @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the fraction of decay energy that is potentially available to the igm ( e.g. , excluding particles that free stream without interacting , such as neutrinos ) ; the meaning of the superscript will become apparent momentarily .",
    "it is convenient to define @xmath90 to be the decay rate normalized for notational convenience to the baryon fraction ( i.e. , the equivalent decay rate if it were the baryons that decayed ) .",
    "then @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the comoving number density of baryons .    for concreteness",
    ", we will assume that the particle decays to high - energy photons , which then either scatter through the igm or free stream to lower redshifts .",
    "( other decay products are of course possible and will have similar qualitative effects ; the important parameter is the total energy injection rate . )",
    "high - energy photons can interact with their surroundings through photoionization , compton scattering , pair production ( via scattering off neutral atoms , free electrons , cmb photons , or ions ) , and scattering with cmb photons @xcite . at the high redshifts of interest here , photoionization and scattering off of free electrons and atoms",
    "dominates energy loss at low photon energies ( @xmath93 ) ; in this regime , the igm is opaque . at high energies ( @xmath94@xmath95 gev , depending on redshift ) , pair production off cmb photons dominates , and",
    "the total optical depth is also large .",
    "the resulting pairs rapidly deposit their energy in the igm . however , between these thresholds lies a  transparency window \" of relatively low optical depth ; photons in this regime experience optical depths ( over a hubble length ) @xmath96@xmath97 at @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "thus they lose only a fraction of their energy to the igm , with the rest free streaming to the present or being lost to cosmic expansion .",
    "the decay energy can be deposited in heating , collisional excitation , or ionization ; while the fractions @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 in each process actually depend on the initial photon energy and the ionized fraction @xcite , to the accuracy of our simple models the rules @xmath102 and @xmath103 suffice @xcite .",
    "when the decay products experience a large optical depth , the energy deposition rate is simply @xmath104 ( hence the superscript ) .",

    "more detailed calculations of @xmath112 can take into account the specific interactions with the igm for a given particle physics model ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but we forego these here to keep our calculations generic .",
    "thus decay into the transparency window can be described in the same way as instantaneous energy injection provided we make the replacement @xmath113 $ ] . in this case",
    ", most of the energy would free - stream to the present day and contribute to the x - ray and @xmath114-ray backgrounds .",
    "if the decay photons are monoenergetic , the observed background provides fairly powerful constraints : @xmath115 for @xmath116 mev or @xmath117 for @xmath118 gev @xcite .",
    "however , existing constraints allow @xmath119 to be much larger if the photons have a wide range of energies",
    ".    we will also consider the case of dark matter annihilation .",
    "neglecting the evolving clumpiness of the dark matter field , the comoving energy deposition rate is @xmath120 where the factor of two occurs because two particles annihilate in each event and @xmath121 is the velocity - averaged annihilation cross section . in this case",
    ", we can define an effective baryon - normalized  lifetime \" via @xmath122 like decay into the transparency window , annihilation can be thought of as a redshift - dependent decay rate . obviously , annihilation injects relatively more energy at high redshifts . for particle decay ,",
    "the free parameter is @xmath123 , which is easy to interpret . for annihilation , it is the less intuitive quantity @xmath124 .",
    "reasonable values for neutralino annihilation are @xmath125 and @xmath126 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for illustrative purposes",

    "we now wish to describe how these processes affect the igm ; our approach in this section is similar to ref .  .",
    "first consider the effects on the globally - averaged temperature and ionized fraction . without dark matter ,",
    "the mean igm temperature @xmath130 is determined by the competition between adiabatic cooling and compton scattering of cmb photons off of the residual free electrons .",
    "we obtain @xcite @xmath131 where @xmath132 , @xmath133 is the cmb energy density at redshift @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 is the helium fraction by number ( we assume helium remains neutral for simplicity )    the mean ionized fraction evolves according to @xmath138 where the first term describes recombinations with an effective coefficient @xmath32 ( taken from ref . ) and @xmath139 is the total mean density of ionized and neutral hydrogen nuclei ( note that gas clumping is negligible at the redshifts of interest here ) . the second term results from dark matter decay ; @xmath140 is the hydrogen ionization threshold .",
    "most ionizations are caused by collisions with hot secondary photo - electrons rather than by direct photoionization , with a total number of ionizations @xmath141 for a photon of energy @xmath142 at @xmath143 @xcite  which agrees well with our assumption that @xmath144 .",
    "note that , by increasing @xmath145 , dark matter decay also makes compton scattering more efficient in equation  ( [ eq : tk ] ) , which provides a second channel for heat input .",
    "this modification to the reionization history affects the cmb temperature and polarization power spectra through thomson scattering during the dark ages .",
    "the _ wmap _ experiment requires @xmath146 @xcite for energy deposition in the optically thick regime .",
    "a more subtle effect of the energy injection is to set up a global ly@xmath32 background , which can couple the spin and kinetic temperatures through the wouthuysen - field effect .",
    "this occurs through collisional excitations induced by fast photoelectrons ( see the analogous discussions in the context of x - ray heating in @xcite ) .",
    "each hydrogen excitation will produce a cascade of line photons ; the lyman - series photon produced in the cascade will then scatter through the ( extremely optically thick ) igm .",
    "higher ly@xmath147 photons will eventually cascade further , with @xmath148 of them being  recycled \" into ly@xmath32 photons @xcite . if a fraction @xmath149 of the input energy eventually goes into ly@xmath32 photons ,",
    "the background is @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the ly@xmath32 line frequency and @xmath152 is the number density of baryons .",
    "interestingly , this can induce relatively large coupling : @xmath153 where @xmath154 .",
    "as we shall see , this becomes potentially important at lower redshifts , when collisional coupling between @xmath155 and @xmath156 weakens .",
    "estimating the precise coupling requires a detailed examination of the collisional excitation processes , which we will forego here given our generic and crude approach .",
    "we will simply assume that one - half of the total excitation energy goes into ly@xmath32 photons , i.e. @xmath157 ( see @xcite for a more comprehensive discussion ) .",
    "this ly@xmath32 background also affects the igm temperature , but the rates are completely negligible in the models we consider @xcite .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : tk ] ) , ( [ eq : xionevol ] ) , and ( [ eq : jalpha ] ) suffice to describe the evolution of the global 21 cm background . but a more interesting observable is how this signal fluctuates , which is easier to measure because the signal monopole is severely contaminated by foregrounds ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : d21 ] ) shows that these fluctuations have a variety of sources",
    ". how do variations in the energy deposition rate source 21 cm fluctuations ?",
    "we can imagine some simple cases for perturbations to @xmath158 .",
    "the first is uniform deposition",
    ". this would be appropriate if , for example , the decays produce particles with long mean - free paths that then deposit energy after interacting with a uniform background ( such as the cmb ) .",
    "this is probably not realistic , because in most cases the majority of energy is ultimately transferred to the igm through relatively low - energy photons or particles with short mean free paths . in such a scenario ,",
    "the local energy injection rate will be proportional to the density ( because the energy deposition rate _ per particle _",
    "is constant ) , even if the intermediate decay products have reasonably long mean free paths . to distinguish these scenarios ,",
    "we define a variable @xmath159 such that the energy deposition rate is proportional to @xmath160 ( i.e. , @xmath161 for uniformly deposited energy ) . for annihilating particles ,",
    "if the energy is deposited immediately , we would have @xmath163 ( assuming that @xmath164 and taylor expanding ) ; in the perhaps more plausible case that the intermediate products have long mean free paths , @xmath165 would be more appropriate .",

    "figure  [ fig : signal - ann ] shows that the effects on @xmath204 and the 21 cm fluctuations are also relatively modest .",

    ", we do not expect the 21 cm background to be as useful for studying dark matter annihilation ( as opposed to decay ) .",
    "this is because a large fraction of the energy is injected at high redshifts , when the 21 cm background vanishes .",
    "fortunately , this is also precisely the regime to which the cmb is most sensitive , so together these techniques will offer a useful window into dark sector processes .",
    "atomic species in gas of primordial composition lack low - lying energy levels .",
    "thus , before the production of metals , molecular hydrogen is a critical coolant vital for star formation to proceed .",
    "an increased @xmath15 abundance could also in principle change the temperature of the gas and affect 21 cm observations . computing the production of @xmath15 in the early universe",
    "has a long history stretching back to the first calculation by saslaw & zipoy @xcite , but more recently it has been the subject of intense study as computational resources and estimates of reaction cross - sections have improved . generally , the amount formed in pregalactic gas , @xmath230 @xcite , is insufficient to be of physical consequence , although the abundance @xmath231@xmath219 formed in the denser and hotter gas of collapsed halos ( where reactions can proceed more quickly ) , _ is _ sufficient to trigger star formation @xcite . if dark matter decay preheats and ionizes the igm , this will boost @xmath15 formation both due to the increased temperature ( since reaction rates are highly temperature dependent ) and the increased abundance of free electrons ( which are a key catalyst )",
    ". it would be exceedingly interesting if this boost was sufficient to affect subsequent structure formation , or left an observational signature .",
    "recent estimates differ as to the magnitude of this boost @xcite . here",

    "in contrast to previous studies , ref . resolve all 423 rotational - vibrational levels of the @xmath233 ion and show that the @xmath233 pathway is greatly suppressed .",

    "we use the fits for @xmath241 from @xcite and calculate @xmath242 as in @xcite . in particular , we take care to compute the non - thermal spectral distortion to the cmb from hi two - photon decay and ly@xmath32 photons from cosmological recombination ( the two have roughly comparable contributions ) by running recfast @xcite and performing the appropriate integrals @xcite .",
    "we use the parametric fit to the two - photon profile given by @xcite .",
    "this component generally becomes important at @xmath243 , when cmb photons above the @xmath232 photo - detachment threshold energy of @xmath244 ev lie in the steeply declining wien tail , and before a significant fraction of distortion photons redshift below threshold .",
    "as we shall see , this is also the period of peak @xmath15 production , even in cases where the igm is pre - heated and ionized .",
    "finally , we also include collisional @xmath15 destruction processes , with reaction rates as given in @xcite , generally the most significant being the charge exchange reaction @xmath245 .",
    "while normally unimportant , they can become significant when the igm is heated above @xmath246 k.    before proceeding to calculate @xmath15 abundances in our energy injection scenarios , we need to consider the importance of other sources of radiation .",
    "the energy injected into the igm from dark matter decay / annihiliations introduces an additional non - thermal component to the radiation field , namely hydrogen lyman series photons from atomic excitations ( as well as two - photon decay products from ionized hydrogen atoms ) .",
    "photodissociation of @xmath232 and @xmath15 could in principle retard @xmath15 formation .",
    "in particular : ( 1 ) ly@xmath32 ( and other ) photons could photodissociate @xmath234 ( which has a @xmath244 ev threshold , and peaks at @xmath247 ev ) . however , this effect is strongly subdominant to the cmb , and ( at @xmath248 ) the spectral distortion from cosmological recombination at @xmath249 .",
    "the latter is easy to see : there must be at least one non - thermal photon per baryon from recombination .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath250 , then as a crude first approximation there are @xmath251 non - thermal photons per baryon from dark matter decay , much less than the contribution from recombination .",
    "( 2 ) lyman - werner ( lw ) photons in the @xmath252@xmath253 ev band could photo - dissociate @xmath15 molecules . unlike @xmath232 photo - dissociation , this possibility only exists with high - redshift energy injection : the non - thermal distortion from recombination only extends up to @xmath254 ev , and rapidly redshifts to lower energies . on the other hand , ly@xmath255 and higher series photons from atomic excitations can photo - dissociate @xmath15 .",
    "we can estimate this effect as follows . about @xmath256 of excitation",
    "energy goes into ly@xmath255 photons ( or @xmath257 of injected energy ) , with a much smaller fraction going into higher order transitions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "each ly@xmath255 photon scatters @xmath258 times before being downgraded to a ly@xmath32 photon @xcite .",
    "thus , ly@xmath255 photons are produced at a rate @xmath259 , and destroyed at a rate @xmath260 n_{\\beta}$ ] .",
    "since the destruction timescale is much shorter than the hubble time , we can consider the ly@xmath255 photons to assume their time - independent value and obtain @xmath261 by setting @xmath262 .",

    "note there is no explicit redshift dependence , apart from possible dependence of @xmath266 on redshift .",
    "since @xmath267 @xcite , this implies a dissociation rate per hubble time of : @xmath268 thus , at most a few percent of @xmath15 molecules will be photo - dissociated by the ambient lw radiation field , and we will ignore this effect ( of course , star formation seeded by @xmath15 production could produce a much larger uv background with much more significant consequences for @xmath15 chemistry ) .    could we observe the non - thermal spectral distortion to the cmb produced by ly@xmath32 photons from energy injection at high redshift ? if @xmath269 , then the comoving number density of ly@xmath32 photons is @xmath270 .",

    "by contrast , the observed extragalactic background light at these wavelengths is @xmath274 ( see fig . 9 of @xcite ) .",

    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : h2_redshift ] .",
    "we see that the boost in @xmath15 production can be substantial in dark matter decay scenarios , with values approaching @xmath276 , which is comparable to the maximal asymptotic abundance of @xmath277 in gas cooling via atomic transitions from @xmath278 k ( the  maximally heated \" case of long - lived dark matter with @xmath217 tends to approach this value , but @xmath15 is rapidly destroyed by charge exchange reactions as the igm temperature climbs past 3000 k ) .",
    "the latter  freeze - out \" value can be understood from simple timescale arguments @xcite . note that we have only computed @xmath15 formation at the mean density of the igm",
    " it will be more efficient and rapid in the higher temperature and denser environments of collapsed halos .",
    "thus , close to the maximal amount of @xmath15 can be formed , certainly comparable to the abundance @xmath231 needed for molecular hydrogen to trigger cooling and star formation in collapsed halos ( e.g. , see @xcite ) . in particular",
    ", it exceeds the @xmath15 abundance formed in low mass halos ( where reactions are slower due to lower temperatures ) catalysed by the low primordial electron fraction @xmath279 .",
    "thus , some of these dark matter decay scenarios may be ruled out on the grounds that they would naturally seed a good deal of high redshift star formation which would violate bounds on the observed _ wmap _ optical depth . however , a variety of interlocking feedback mechanisms are at play , so it is difficult to make quantitative claims without further study .",
    "for example , one possible caveat to the claim that early preheating / reionization would seed early star formation is that the entropy of the igm will suppress gas accretion onto halos and instead exert a negative feedback effect @xcite",
    ". however , early reionization by decaying dark matter differs in one crucial respect from early reionization by stars , the scenario envisaged by ref .",
    ": unlike early star formation , reionization by decaying dark matter is accompanied by a negligible lw background . ref . showed that the cores of gas accreted from a high entropy igm had low enough densities that a small lw background would suffice to destroy any @xmath15 formed ",
    "i.e . , the photo - dissociation timescale was much shorter than the @xmath15 cooling time .",
    "by contrast , in our present scenario the lw background is negligible and indeed , @xmath15 can form and survive at the mean density of the igm .",
    "thus , as long as the gas can contract to sufficient density that the cooling time falls below the expansion timescale , the effect of the entropy floor is unimportant .",
    "of course , once some star formation takes place , the lw background rises and @xmath15 destruction in low density cores and the igm proceeds .",
    "therefore , detailed study is necessary to understand if an early epoch of preheating and copious @xmath15 production will indeed result in extensive star formation in violation of wmap optical depth bounds .",
    "there are a few general features worth noting about @xmath15 production in these scenarios .",
    "most of the @xmath15 in all scenarios is made at @xmath280 ; this is the highest redshift at which @xmath232 photo - detachment from the high - energy tail of cmb becomes unimportant , yet where the igm gas is still sufficiently dense that reactions can proceed rapidly .",
    "this era of peak @xmath15 production is fairly independent of temperature or ionization history in the different scenarios .",
    "the boost in @xmath15 production is primarily due to the increased free electron fraction ; for low @xmath281 , we see from equation ( [ eqn : h2_production ] ) that @xmath282 ( indeed , the peak @xmath15 abundance can roughly be estimated from @xmath283 , where @xmath284 , and @xmath285 is the redshift at which @xmath286 peaks ) .",
    "the @xmath15 formed should not have a significant effect on the temperature of the igm : since the @xmath15 cooling function @xmath287 for @xmath288 k , the cooling time is : @xmath289 where @xmath25 is the gas overdensity .",
    "this is substantially greater than the hubble time and the compton cooling time @xmath290/100)^{-4 } ( x_{e}/10^{-2})^{-1 } { \\mbox { yr}}$ ] .",
    "the effects of @xmath15 cooling are only important in dense virialized halos .",
    "apart from the possible effect of seeding high - redshift star formation , there are few observable consequences of this large amount of early @xmath15 formation .",
    "they could potentially increase fluctuations in ly@xmath32 coupling ( due to the consumption of lw photons in photo - dissociation regions ) , but this is likely difficult to detect .",
    "the 21 cm transition is , at least in principle , a window into the dark ages of structure formation at @xmath291 .",
    "we have argued that , because of the overall simplicity of the ( known ) physics at that time  the expanding universe , hydrogen recombination , and linear gravitational growth ",
    "it presents a unique probe of both cosmology @xcite and exotic processes such as dark matter decay and annihilation .",
    "the heating and ionization induced by the decay ( or annihilation ) products can significantly affect the igm .",
    "these processes can modify the cmb power spectrum @xcite , but this is a relatively insensitive measure because it requires a large @xmath145 for scattering to be significant .",
    "here we have shown that the 21 cm history is a sensitive measure of decay and annihilation during the dark ages ( see also @xcite ) , because it directly measures the thermal history of the igm . in the standard calculation , adiabatic cooling drives @xmath130 to such low levels that heating the igm significantly requires much less energy than ionizing it .",
    "we have shown that dark matter with lifetimes @xmath292@xmath64 can substantially affect the 21 cm background ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : signal - thick ] and [ fig : signal - thin ] ) .",
    "these timescales are about three to four orders of magnitude longer than those probed by the cmb .",
    "the improvement is considerably smaller for annihilation scenarios , because those tend to inject most of their energy nearer the surface of last scattering , when the cmb is more sensitive and the 21 cm background vanishes .",
    "we have made predictions for both the sky - averaged signal  which measures the total energy deposition rate @xcite  and the 21 cm power spectrum .",
    "because the temperature , ionization fraction , and ly@xmath32 background all affect the 21 cm signal , the overall amplitude and redshift evolution ( at _ any _ scale ) of @xmath206 can provide powerful constraints on such exotic processes : reasonable scenarios produce order unity effects on the power spectrum and also introduce non - trivial redshift dependence if the igm ever becomes hotter than the cmb .",
    "thus _ any _ measurement of @xmath206 during the dark ages ( such as those advocated by @xcite ) will be useful in this context , even if it only measures fluctuations on rather large scales .",
    "more detailed measurements can begin to constrain the decay and annihilation processes themselves by inferring the properties of the products that interact with the igm .",
    "for example , if the decay produces either soft ( @xmath293 ) or extremely hard ( @xmath294 ) photons , the energy will be deposited into the igm nearly instantaneously @xcite . in this case",
    "the effects will be most obvious at lower redshifts , when there is more time for heating to take place and compton coupling with the ( spatially uniform ) cmb is weaker . on the other hand ,",
    "if the igm is optically thin to the products ( or if the dark matter annihilates ) , the consequences are more confined to higher redshifts ( where the optical depth is larger because of the increased density ) .",
    "more subtly , the interaction processes between the igm and the decay products determine the fluctuations in the ionizing and heating rates , which in turn affect @xmath206 ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : breakdown ] and [ fig : signal - ann ] ) . in some cases",
    ", this could even introduce extra spatial dependence into the power spectrum , although we have not examined such effects here .    rather than examining specific particle physics models",
    ", we used a generic and flexible formulation for decay and annihilation .",
    "we refer the interested reader to the discussions in  [ particles ] and in refs .   for the thermal and ionization histories in specific models . in general",
    ", however , we note that among recently popular models , decaying light dark matter ( such as axinos and sterile neutrinos ) would have the strongest effects",
    ". the decay of heavy dark matter could also affect the thermal history , though this depends strongly on the allowed decay channels .",
    "neutralino annihilation , or the annihilation of light dark matter , could also provide an interesting signal .",
    "we have also shown that the heat deposited in the igm , as well as the excess ionization , can affect the chemistry of the igm .",
    "in particular , the increased temperature and ionization can dramatically increase the rate of h@xmath9 formation . while the resulting abundance can be up to orders of magnitude higher than the standard value ( and in some cases comparable to the maximal asymptotic abundance @xmath277 for gas phase @xmath15 formation ) ,",
    "it is not an important coolant at the low densities of the igm .",
    "thus its direct observable effects are small .",
    "however , the increased @xmath15 abundance will strongly simulate early star formation in dense halos , quite possibly violating wmap constraints on @xmath295 . with better modeling",
    ", observations of the first stars and @xmath295 may also provide limits on dark matter decay and annihilation .",
    "we must of course acknowledge the tremendous difficulty posed by 21 cm observations at @xmath291 , the regime in which dark matter decay signatures would be cleanest .",
    "the principal challenge is the enormous brightness of the galactic synchrotron foreground , which has a brightness temperature @xmath296 at the relevant frequencies of @xmath297 .",
    "it will make measurements of the smoothly varying @xmath204 extremely difficult ; searches for fluctuations will probably be much easier ( though still well beyond current capabilities ) .",
    "the largest transverse wavenumber observable by an array distributed in a circle with radius @xmath298 is @xmath299 \\ , ( r_{\\rm max}/2 \\ , { \\rm km } ) { \\mbox { mpc$^{-1}$}}$ ] . for a crude sensitivity estimate",
    ", we consider an array with uniform baseline coverage observing the spherically - averaged signal .",
    "then the error on the power spectrum at wavenumber @xmath45 would be @xcite @xmath300 where @xmath301 is the array covering factor , @xmath302 is its effective area , @xmath303 is the bandwidth of the observation , @xmath304 is the total integration time , and we have binned the data in segments of logarithmic length @xmath305 .",
    "here we have assumed that @xmath45 is much larger than the wavenumber corresponding to the total bandwidth of the experiment ( @xmath306 for @xmath307 ) and much smaller than @xmath308 .",
    "most importantly , we have assumed a large field of view  of order one steradian  corresponding to baselines of order 10 m ; thus , the instrument must be composed of many small antennae .",
    "our parameter choices in equation  ( [ eq : sens ] ) allow a direct comparison with the figures in this paper at @xmath8 if @xmath309 km .",
    "clearly , several square kilometers of collecting area are required to produce any useful limits .",
    "moving to larger scales can help slightly , but foreground removal will probably compromise measurements at @xmath310 ( see  9.3 of ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "fortunately , more compact array designs improve the sensitivity over a uniform baseline distribution by factors of a few ( see fig .  6 of ref .  ) .",
    "exploration of the highly - redshifted 21 cm sky is just beginning , and over the next few years we should learn much more about what is possible .",
    "when experiments to open up the dark ages do eventually come along , they will provide important constraints on dark matter decay and annihilation  which can plausibly have order unity effects on the 21 cm signals .",
