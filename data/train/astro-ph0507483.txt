    "recent measurements of the uhecr composition by the hires prototype / mia experiment@xcite ( hires / mia ) and by hires in stereo mode@xcite ( hires stereo ) , seem to indicate that the cosmic ray composition is changing from heavy to light below @xmath1 ev , and then remains light above @xmath1 ev .",
    "this interpretation depends on the fact that hires / mia measures a large elongation rate , larger than expected from an unchanging composition , while hires stereo measures an elongation rate consistent with an unchanging composition .",
    "the two measurements barely overlap in energy range , and the change in the elongation rate is in just this overlapping range .",
    "one would like to observe the low energy , changing composition becoming constant at higher energies , all in one experiment . to do so with the hires detector one must go lower in energy , which also requires that one look at monocular data ; lower energy showers",
    "will only be observed from one site , if at all .",
    "unfortunately , the limited elevation coverage of the hires - ii detector biases the @xmath0  acceptance , with the bias increasing at lower energies .",
    "the bias stems from the requirement that one find @xmath0   within that extent of the shower observed in the detector .",
    "events that are closer to the detector are more likely to have @xmath0  above the visible range , and thus be cut .",
    "furthermore , because lower energies can only be observed close to the detector , events at these energies will have a larger acceptance bias than those at higher energies .",
    "iron showers at a given energy , will be more affected than proton showers .",
    "this bias precludes performing an elongation rate analysis at energies below @xmath1 ev .",
    "instead of performing an elongation rate analysis , we have chosen to fit the @xmath0  distribution to a combination of @xmath0  distributions from proton and from iron primaries .",
    "the proton and iron @xmath0   distributions are generated by monte carlo ( mc ) simulation .",
    "the @xmath0  distribution , in a given energy bin , is stored in a histogram , and the data histogram is then fit to a combination of the proton and iron mc histograms to find the proportion of each .",
    "the fit is performed using the binned maximum likelihood technique as implemented in the hbook@xcite routine hmclnl .",
    "the statistical uncertainty of the fit is taken from the width of @xmath2 as fit to a quadratic in the region about the minimum .",
    "once the proton fraction in an energy bin is determined , one must correct for the fact that proton and iron showers have different acceptances at a given energy .",
    "this is done using the acceptances calculated from the same mc samples used to make the @xmath0   distributions for fitting the data .",
    "the observed events at a given energy are split up into the proton events and the iron events according to the proton fraction .",
    "each of these samples is then corrected for the acceptance , giving the number of proton events and the iron events one would see with a fixed aperture and no @xmath0   bias .",
    "these corrected numbers of events are then used to calculate the true proton fraction .",
    "we generated three sets of monte carlo ( mc ) data using corsika / qgsjet01@xcite .",
    "these three sets all use the broken power law fit to the fly s eye@xcite stereo spectrum as an input spectrum .",
    "the sets differ according to the composition , with one being pure proton , one being pure iron , and one having the mixed composition implied by the elongation rate measurements compared to qgsjet expectations .",
    "this last set is also the one used in the hires - ii monocular spectrum analysis .",
    "the fitting procedure itself only uses the pure composition sets ; the mixed composition set is used for cross checking .",
    "the results of the fits for proton fraction in the various energy bands are shown in figures  [ fig : compfit ] .",
    "two component composition fits of the @xmath0  distribution in bins centered at @xmath3 , 17.6 , 17.8 , 18 , 18.2 , 18.4 , 18.65 and 19.2 ( @xmath4 in ev ) .",
    "the left side shows the quality - of - fit versus the proton fraction .",
    "the right side shows the best fit ( red ) against the data ( black points ) along with the two components , protons ( blue ) and iron ( green ) . ]",

    "the measurement indicates that the composition is dominated by protons above an energy of @xmath5 .",
    "the composition lower energies , but there are large uncertainties .",
    "the top plane shows the measured proton fraction in each energy bin . the bottom plane shows the proton fraction after the acceptance correction .",
    "the hires / mia and hires stereo @xmath0  measurements , interpreted as a proton fraction using the qgsjet01 expectations , are shown in green.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    as a cross check of our procedure , we have performed the same analysis using the mixed mc .",
    "the results , before and after the acceptance correction , are shown in figure  [ compfit - res - mc ] . in the mc case , we can know the particle type of each shower that passes the analysis cuts .",
    "this is used to calculate the exact proton fraction , which is shown as the blue points in the top plane of figure  [ compfit - res - mc ] .",
    "these points agree well with the proton fractions obtained from fitting .",
    "likewise , the corrected mc composition matches very well the hires / mia and hires stereo proton fractions which were used as inputs .",
    "the top plane shows the measured proton fraction of a mc sample ( filled black points ) , along with the exact fraction ( open blue points ) .",
