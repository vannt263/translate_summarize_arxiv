    "radio astronomy began with the discovery of celestial radio emission by k.  jansky at  20.5  mhz @xcite . throughout the 1950s and 1960s , key discoveries and technological advances in radio astronomy  at low - frequencies ( @xmath1  mhz ) in particular",
    " helped form the basis of modern astronomy , including :    * the introduction of non - thermal processes as an astrophysical source of emission @xcite , motivated by early observations of the diffuse galactic radio emission at  160  mhz @xcite , though it took some time for the importance of non - thermal processes to be accepted widely ; * the discovery of pulsars through observations at  81  mhz @xcite ; and * the development of aperture synthesis interferometry at  38  mhz @xcite .",
    "( see also the work by @xcite and @xcite using a `` sea interferometer '' at frequencies between  75 and  3000  mhz . )    by the late 1960s and early 1970s , however , interest turned to obtaining high - resolution images .",
    "powerful centimeter - wavelength interferometers began to provide sub - arcminute angular resolution ( or sub - arcsecond resolution in the case of the vla by the late 1970s ) with dynamic ranges of several hundred or better .",
    "even so , a number of low - frequency interferometers continued to be constructed , some with truly impressive collecting areas ( @xmath2  m@xmath3 ) , including the utr-2 @xcite , the culgoora radioheliograph , the cambridge synthesis telescope , and the clark lake tpt radio telescope @xcite .",
    "however , with the exception of the merlin @xcite and gmrt 151  mhz systems @xcite and for all telescopes operating below 100 mhz , the maximum baselines were relatively limited ( @xmath4  km ) .",
    "the corresponding angular resolution was relatively poor ( @xmath5 ) , and the resulting high confusion levels meant poor sensitivities ( @xmath6  jy ) .",
    "the primary constraint on baseline length were the phase distortions imposed by the earth s ionosphere over the intrinsically wide fields of view and the lack of suitable algorithms to compensate for the distortions .",
    "on baselines longer than a few kilometers , ionospheric phase distortions are severe enough to cause decorrelation , making higher - resolution imaging difficult to impossible , especially at the lowest frequencies ( @xmath7 mhz ) .",
    "this paucity of large aperture , high - sensitivity , synthesis instruments operating below  100  mhz has left this portion of the radio spectrum poorly explored . yet",
    ", there are a variety of topics that could be addressed by a sensitive , high - angular - resolution , low - frequency telescope including :    * continuum spectra over much larger frequency dynamic ranges for studies of shock acceleration and spectral aging in galactic ( supernova remnants ) and extragalactic ( radio galaxies and galaxy cluster relics ) sources ; * efficient detection of large numbers of steep spectrum sources , which can be imaged in some cases , including high - redshift radio galaxies , shocks driven by infalling matter in clusters of galaxies , and pulsars in the milky way and possibly in external galaxies ; * probing the ionized interstellar medium ( ism ) via measurements of radio - wave scattering and absorption , the distribution of low - density ionized gas toward nonthermal sources , and hydrogen and carbon recombination line observations of very high rydberg state atoms ; * the large opacity of regions below  100  mhz can enable distance determinations to various foreground objects , in both the galaxy and external galaxies , from which the three - dimensional distribution and spectrum of cosmic - ray emissivity can be determined as well as being used to measure their emission measures , temperatures , pressures , and ionization states * detection of coherent emission from sources such as the sun , jupiter , pulsars , and possibly radio bursts from nearby stars and extrasolar planets .    while earlier experience with merlin and the vla ( and more recently with the gmrt ) demonstrated that large ( @xmath8 5  km ) interferometers could compensate for ionospheric effects below @xmath9330  mhz ,",
    "a prototype 74  mhz system was the first to demonstrate that self - calibration techniques can correct for the large ionospheric - induced phase errors below 100 mhz .",
    "the prototype 74  mhz system consisted of eight of the vla s 28 antennas equipped with 74  mhz receivers , and @xcite were able to produce images with sub - arcminute resolutions and sub - jansky sensitivities , thereby demonstrating that these self - calibration techniques were able to correct for ionospheric phase errors on baselines at least as long as the longest vla baselines ( 35  km ) and , in principle , much longer . because of the limited number of antennas , the prototype 74  mhz system had relatively poor @xmath10-@xmath11 coverage , so only the strongest ( @xmath12  jy ) sources , numbering a dozen or so , were imaged .    in  1998",
    "january all 28 vla antennas were equipped with  74  mhz antennas .",
    "this improved the capability of the instrument greatly , and it is now possible to detect hundreds of sources in single fields at high angular resolution and sensitivity . at the same time",
    ", a number of innovative procedures and software solutions have been developed to handle the data , some of which are significantly different than at centimeter wavelengths and others of which are applicable to , and new to , centimeter wavelengths .",
    "figures  [ fig : resolution ] and  [ fig : sensitivity ] illustrate the levels of resolution and sensitivity now possible with this new system , improvements that are all the more impressive given that the relatively modest collecting area and low efficiency of the vla ( @xmath13  m@xmath14 effective collecting area , @xmath15% of many of the other telescopes shown ) .",
    "this paper describes the fully operational 74  mhz system ( hardware and software ) on the . in  [ sec : history ] we summarize briefly the characteristics of the prototype array as they relate to the current system . in  [ sec : general ] we review general characteristics of the current low frequency system , summarize its general performance , and highlight those aspects that are significantly different than at centimeter wavelengths .",
    "we describe the calibration of 74  mhz observations in  [ sec : calibrate ] and their imaging in  [ sec : imaging ] . in  [ sec : dynamic ] we suggest how the current system could be improved via dynamic scheduling . in  [ sec : future ] we discuss possible future expansions of low - frequency synthesis instruments using the lessons from the 74  mhz system , and we present our conclusions in  [ sec : conclude ] . in appendix",
    "[ sec : example ] we present selected examples of imaging of moderately strong 3c sources .    throughout the paper",
    "we shall illustrate various effects with images or other figures produced from 74  mhz observations .",
    "the examples we show are a heterogeneous lot , resulting from a number of different observations of different sources acquired for different purposes .",
    "our objective is to present a representative sample of various effects , but not all effects will necessarily be present in every observation .",
    "the original design of the very large array included only four frequency bands , centered near wavelengths of  21 , 6 , 2 , and  1.3  cm @xcite . however , there is no fundamental reason a low - frequency system can not operate on the array  the principles of aperture synthesis are as applicable to  50  mhz as they are to  5  ghz .",
    "more importantly , the key components of the array  the signal collection ( antennas ) , signal transmission ( waveguide ) , and signal processing ( correlator and post - processing)are essentially frequency independent within the radio part of the spectrum . as soon as the construction phase of the vla ended , discussions on implementing a low - frequency capability began .",
    "@xcite advocated a free - standing array that would make use of the vla s infrastructure ( most importantly , the waveguide transmission system ) to achieve approximately 25  resolution .",
    "however , no source of funding was obvious , and it was decided subsequently that trial systems could be implemented on the vla itself to address key questions regarding the calibration and imaging of low frequency , long - baseline data .    the initial low - frequency system , operating at  90  cm ( 300 to  340  mhz ) , was installed between  1983 and  1989 .",
    "it is a prime - focus system , as it is impractical to implement a secondary focus system at such a low frequency .",
    "the feed is a crossed dipole , situated in front of the cassegrain subreflector , which thus acts as a ( rather imperfect ) ground plane . because of this , and because the phase center is located approximately 50  cm ( @xmath16 ) in front of the true focus , this system has both a low efficiency ( less than 40% ) and a very broad shoulder of width approximately 12  in the antenna power pattern .",
    "nevertheless , it has been a very successful and widely used frequency band at the .",
    "most importantly , it encouraged the development of the multi - faceted imaging algorithms @xcite needed for wide - field , low - frequency observing , as described later in this paper .",
    "its operation also demonstrated the robustness of angle - independent self - calibration (  [ sec : pcal ] ) for removing ionospheric distortions across the large ( @xmath92.5 fwhp )  90  cm field of view .",
    "the success of the 330  mhz system soon led to consideration of a lower frequency facility . a protected radio astronomy frequency allocation exists between  73 and  74.6  mhz .",
    "again , funding constraints led to the decision to deploy a trial system , comprising a simple feed system on a few of the vla s antennas .",
    "the feed system chosen is essentially the same as that used at  330  mhz  crossed dipoles in front of the subreflector .",
    "because of the long wavelength , the defocussing errors that affect 330  mhz performance severely are not serious at  74  mhz . however , because the antenna itself is only approximately @xmath17 in diameter , the subreflector is an imperfect ground plane , and the profound effect of the antenna quadrupod structure , it was anticipated that the forward gain and sidelobe structure would be fairly poor  as subsequent measurements have borne out . @xcite",
    "describe the prototype 74  mhz system in more detail and describe the initial data calibration and imaging methodologies .",
    "amplifiers and feeds for the complete 74  mhz system were built during the summer of  1997 by two of us ( wce and bh ) at the nrl and deployed during the fall of that year .",
    "all antennas were equipped with dipoles by  1998 january .    because of concerns about blockage at higher frequencies , a deployable crossed - dipole feed was designed .",
    "the half - wavelength dipoles contribute to blockage and a higher system temperature , resulting in a total sensitivity loss of about  6% at  1.4  ghz and smaller losses at higher frequencies , so they are deployed only during a fraction of the time in each configuration .",
    "a simple mounting system is used  two ropes , each of which supports one dipole , are threaded through eyebolts located on opposite quadrupod legs at the appropriate height .",
    "the ends of these ropes are tied to cleats located at a convenient height on the quadrupod legs .",
    "the signal cables drop about  7  m to the antenna surface , where they pass through the roof of the vertex room to the amplifiers .",
    "figure  [ fig : mount ] shows the dipoles and mounting system developed .",
    "the receiver units combine the linearly polarized signals of the dipoles to produce circular polarized signals , then amplify and bandpass filter these signals , and pass them to the vla intermediate frequency ( if ) system .",
    "they also contain an integral noise calibration source . in order to produce serviceable receivers on a short timescale and at low cost ,",
    "they were constructed almost entirely from commercial components .",
    "the vla signal transmission system allows for two pairs of two parallel - hand signals to be transmitted .",
    "the receiver system is designed so that the two senses of circular polarization from the 74  mhz receivers occupy one pair of signal transmission channels while the two senses of circular polarization at  330  mhz occupy the other pair of signal transmission channels .",
    "thus , 74 and  330  mhz observations can be acquired simultaneously .",
    "@xcite used this simultaneous , dual - frequency capability for ionospheric calibration via phase transfer from  330 to  74  mhz ( see  [ sec : calibrate ] ) .",
    "an alternate signal transmission approach is to use one pair of signals for the upper half of the 1.5  mhz bandpass and the other pair for the lower half , thereby obtaining higher spectral resolution , primarily for radio frequency interference ( rfi ) excision purposes (  [ sec : rfi ] ) .",
    "measurements of circular polarization are normally available and have been used for both astronomical ( solar , t. bastian , private communication , 1998 ) and rfi excision purposes.30 % , and since initial attempts at polarization calibration using aips task polcal failed , users have not been encouraged to utilize this mode .",
    "it is possible that a dedicated effort with the evla correlator might permit full polarization astronomical measurements in the future , although it is suspected that many , except relatively nearby sources , might be depolarized at this frequency due to faraday rotation . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : receiver ] presents a complete block diagram of a receiver . in detail , the receiver units are comprised of the following components :    1 .",
    "the two orthogonal linear feeds are converted by a full quad hybrid into right and left circular polarizations ( rcp , lcp ) .",
    "2 .   an onboard source injects a noise calibration signal into both the rcp and lcp chains via directional couplers .",
    "this source is directly powered by a `` cal '' signal provided by the site .",
    "out - of - band rejection filtering is provided by high - q cavity filters with a center frequency of  73.9  mhz and a 1.7  mhz bandwidth .",
    "such a narrow bandwidth is necessitated by the close proximity of local television stations .",
    "( tests have been conducted with a 3  mhz bandwidth ; the tv signals saturated the receivers . )",
    "4 .   for the vla",
    ", the signal is transferred directly to the if system while for the pt receiver , the signal is upcoverted in order to pass into the vlba if system , by mixing the rcp and lcp channels with a reference local oscillator ( lo ) signal .",
    "5 .   two power combiners consolidate the 74 and 330  mhz channels for transport to the correlator .    the initial work on the 74  mhz system focused on the vla alone .",
    "concurrently nrao was in the process of testing fiber optic transmission techniques by tying in the nearby pie town antenna ( pt ) of the very long baseline array ( vlba ) .",
    "first fringes between a vla subarray and the pt antenna were observed in  1998 december , and a successful test with the pt antenna and the full vla was conducted in  1999 september .",
    "routine observations on this facility began in  2000 october .",
    "consequences of this fiber - optic link to pie town ( the pt link ) are that the longest vla baselines are extended to approximately 70  km , but the number of antennas in the vla decreases to  26 because the pt antenna replaces one of the antennas in the vla and the vla signal electronics requires removing another antenna from the array to accommodate the pt signal",
    ".    initial efforts on the pt link focused on frequencies above  1000  mhz .",
    "the vlba does have a standard observing frequency at  330  mhz , but it does not have a 74  mhz operating capability . in  2000 ,",
    "nrl and nrao initiated a program to add a 74  mhz capability to the pt antenna and to operate the pt link at both 74 and  330  mhz .",
    "initial tests were conducted with the 74  mhz receiver replacing the 330  mhz receiver , but the electronics path has been modified subsequently to operate at both 74 and  330  mhz simultaneously .",
    "figure  [ fig : ptlink ] shows the first successful fringes at  74  mhz , obtained on the quasar in the fall of  2001 . in the remainder of this paper",
    "we shall focus on the vla system alone .",
    "many of the techniques we describe are equally applicable to observations with the pt link , though experience with that system is considerably more limited and has only been used to observe relatively bright , isolated objects @xcite .",
    "see appendix  a for an example of the full synthesis vla+pt image of cas  a ( figure  [ fig : casapt ] ) .",
    "table  [ tab : perform ] summarizes the performance characteristics of the vla s 74  mhz system .",
    "we quote a sky - noise dominated system temperature that is appropriate for the galactic polar caps .",
    "while the sky - noise for fields on the galactic plane can be up to ten times higher , in practice the low forward gain of the primary beam smooths out and lowers the variations in t@xmath18 to typically a factor of two or less (  [ sec : ampcal ] ) the sensitivity listed is typical for the a and  b configurations , for regions away from the galactic plane .",
    "sensitivities for the smaller configurations are considerably poorer , because of confusion (  [ sec : confuse ] ) and presumably because of low - level , broad - band rfi from the antennas and equipment located at the vla site .",
    "figure  [ fig : beam ] shows the primary beam power pattern measured for one of the antennas .",
    "other antennas show similar power patterns .",
    "table  [ tab : perform ] cites the primary beamwidth as 117 , but it is clear that the beam has only a modest forward gain and a broad plateau with a poor sidelobe structure .",
    "these result from the aforementioned aspects of the system that the antenna itself is only approximately @xmath17 in diameter and the antenna quadrupod structure .",
    "notice that the sharp edge seen on the right side of the beams presented in figure  [ fig : beam ] is due to the fact that this portion of the beam was not sampled .",
    "this was due to motion limitations of the vla antennas during the holography measurements used to determine the beam power pattern .",
    "nevertheless , this sampling issue did not affect the mapping of the most important part of the beam , down to 20 - 25  db from the peak .",
    "the poor primary beam definition gives rise to significant sidelobe confusion , as discussed below and further in  [ sec : confuse ] .",
    "figures  [ fig : bandwidth ] and  [ fig : time ] show the system sensitivity , as measured by the rms noise level in an image , as a function of increasing receiver bandwidth and integration time .",
    "this behaviour is typical of observations obtained in the a and b configurations .",
    "these images were excised of narrow - band rfi , calibrated and imaged following the procedures described in sections 4 and 5 .",
    "the deviation from a @xmath19 dependence with increasing receiver bandwidth in figure  [ fig : bandwidth ] indicates that the system is not thermal noise limited . on the other hand",
    ", figure  [ fig : time ] shows an approximate @xmath20 dependence normally indicative of a thermal noise limited response .",
    "taken together we conclude that we are mainly sidelobe confusion limited since its effects should be independent of bandwidth to first order , but scale roughly as @xmath20 because sources moving through the sidelobes contribute noise in a random walk fashion that averages out with time-@xmath11 coverage repeats . in practice , however , position shifts caused by the ionosphere (  [ sec : pdelay ] ) act to `` thermalize '' the sidelobe confusion contribution .",
    "thus , we believe that the noise due to sidelobe confusion will continue to decrease , at least initially , as @xmath20 even after the @xmath10-@xmath11 coverage repeats . ] for integrations of @xmath211  hr , the deviation from thermal noise is typically a factor of 2 - 4",
    ".    the residual effects of incompletely removed rfi must also play a role in the reduced sensitivity .",
    "in fact the sensitivity in the c and d configurations is much poorer than expected from confusion alone , and our hypothesis is that the effects of low - level , broad - band rfi are responsible for that . in practice the 74 mhz system is rarely used in either the c or d configurations .",
    "we note that while table  [ tab : perform ] quotes an 8 hour sensitivity limit of  25 mjy , in practice the achievable sensitivity may vary considerably due to the positionally dependent sky noise dominated system temperature , and more importantly from the relative proximity to the handful of extremely bright sources that often dominate the sidelobe confusion ( e.g. , , etc . ) in  [ sec : confuse ] we discuss both sidelobe and classical confusion further , and show that in the more compact configurations the latter effect can become significant .",
    "observations of the brightest sources in the sky ( e.g. , , ) with the prototype 74  mhz system demonstrated that the methodologies and algorithms that had been developed for calibration at the standard vla frequencies were generally sufficient for 74  mhz @xcite , with self - calibration being particularly important . the larger number of antennas now available makes self - calibration even more robust , but it has also revealed its limits more clearly .    in this section we motivate and describe the procedures we have developed for the calibration and imaging of  74  mhz data . the procedure can be summarized as follows :    bandpass calibration (  [ sec : bpass ] ) : :    observations at  74  mhz are acquired in a spectral line mode , both to    enable rfi excision and to avoid bandwidth smearing over the    relatively large fields of view . therefore we need to apply a baseline    correction to the data .",
    "rfi excision (  [ sec : rfi ] ) : :    largely because of self - interference , 74  mhz data always must be    edited to remove",
    ". amplitude calibration (  [ sec : ampcal ] ) : :    as at higher frequencies , a source whose flux density is presumed to    be known must be observed to set the flux density scale .",
    "the primary    flux density calibrator for the vla at  74  mhz is .",
    "other sources that    can be used when is not available are , , and .",
    "phase calibration : :    the dominant source of phase corruption at low frequencies is due to    the earth s ionosphere .",
    "unlike at higher frequencies , one can not    employ as a phase calibrator a source nearby in the sky to one s    target source or field .",
    "instead we have developed two strategies :    +    * when the isoplanatic patch ( scale over which the rms phase    difference between two lines of sight is approximately 1  radian ) size    is larger than the field of view of interest (  [ sec : pcal ] ) , a single    phase calibration can be applied to the entire field of view . it is    most useful in the more compact configurations ( c and  d ) or in the    larger configurations ( a and  b ) when imaging a strong source .",
    "this    strategy relies heavily on current implementations of    self - calibration , and it is similar to the calibration strategy used    by @xcite . as such , this strategy is a confirmation of their    prediction that self - calibration can be used to remove ionospheric    phase fluctuations .    * when the isoplanatic patch size is smaller than the field of view of    interest (  [ sec : pdelay ] ) , an angular dependence _ within the field of    view _ of interest",
    "must be used in the phase calibration .",
    "we have used    a method called `` field - based '' calibration to do this , which models    the ionosphere as a phase - delay screen and uses a grid of background    sources to solve for the ionospheric refraction , both globally and    differentially within the field of view .",
    "following sections describe imaging requirements (  [ sec : imaging ] ) and present examples designed to illustrate the efficacy of both phase calibration strategies (  [ sec : example ] ) .",
    "this section parallels closely the discussion in our online tutorial , which contains more detailed descriptions of the procedures , as well as sample inputs for reducing data within aips .      as described below (  [ sec",
    ": rfi ] ) , the vla generates considerable internal radio frequency interference .",
    "consequently , observations are performed in a spectral - line mode , which also avoids bandwidth smearing over the large regions ( typically ) imaged (  [ sec : imaging ] ) .",
    "characteristic spectral channel bandwidths are 12  khz in a 1.5  mhz total bandpass . as with any spectral line observation , the amplitude variations across the band ( and phase gradients due to delay errors )",
    "must be removed by bandpass calibration .",
    "fortunately , the flux density of ( @xmath22  kjy ) is nearly always much greater than the equivalent flux density of any rfi , even in the narrowest channels that the vla correlator can produce ( 12  khz ) , meaning that one can use observations of it to calibrate the bandpass prior to excising .",
    "other sources  such as , , can also be used ; their lower signal - to - noise ratios on longer baselines can require judicious choices of time or frequency ranges or both in order to calibrate the bandpass .",
    "bandpass calibration is traditionally performed with the assumption that the flux density of the calibrator can be represented by a single value across the bandpass . in the case of 74  mhz observations with the vla",
    ", however , the fractional bandwidth of the system is large enough that the intrinsic visibility of can change across it .",
    "a rough estimate shows that the effect of resolution can be ignored if @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the fractional bandwidth and @xmath25 is the source size expressed in units of the synthesized beam . in the a configuration ,",
    "the left - hand side of equation  ( [ eqn : bpass ] ) is 0.3 , so there is a 30% change ( worst case ) in visibility across the bandpass on the longest baseline ; in the smaller configurations , the error introduced by the fractional bandwidth is proportionally less .",
    "two options exist for dealing with the effects of the intrinsic visibility change across the bandpass .",
    "first , one can set an upper limit to the baseline length to be considered , effectively decreasing @xmath25 .",
    "second , one can divide the observed visibilities at each frequency by a model of the source , thereby transforming the visibilities into what would have been obtained had a point source been observed . in practice ,",
    "the second option is used most often in order to employ the maximum amount of the data possible , and models of , , , and are available online .",
    "this second method , dividing the visibilities by a model of the source , is done before the visibility amplitudes are calibrated . at higher frequencies ,",
    "the standard bandpass calibration procedure at the vla is to divide by the `` channel  0 '' continuum data , formed by averaging the inner 75% of the bandpass . rather than using a `` channel  0 '' continuum , which would be contaminated by the presence of the 100  khz comb (  [ sec : rfi ] )",
    ", one first solves for the individual channel corrections ( both amplitude and phase ) .",
    "these corrections are then normalized so that the mean correction across the spectrum is unity .",
    "various weighting schemes can be used during the normalization process . in practice ,",
    "the weights used in normalization are often taken to be independent of channel ; the converse , scaling the weights by some function of the amplitude in each channel , can have the effect of giving more weight to baselines with more rfi ( higher amplitudes ) and the short baselines ( which are most often affected by rfi ) .",
    "in general a single bandpass correction is determined from all observations of the bandpass calibrator , and this correction is applied to all other observations within that `` observing run . '' for bright sources , residual bandpass calibration errors can introduce systematic errors in the image ( appearing in the shape of the beam , but which can not be cleaned ) and thereby limit the dynamic range of the image . in these cases , one of two strategies can be adopted .",
    "if one has multiple observations of the bandpass calibrator , one can attempt to form the bandpass correction as a function of time .",
    "alternately , during self - calibration one can produce a different phase correction for each channel ( or small number of channels ) .",
    "radio frequency interference ( rfi ) is a significant problem for low frequency vla observations , though we note that there is little _",
    "rfi within the passband of 73.074.6  mhz .",
    "rfi is the major limiting factor for the dynamic range of the data observed with the more compact vla configurations ( c and d ) , due to the interference between the individual antennas of the array .",
    "it also constitutes an important issue for the more extended configurations ( a and b ) , and needs to be dealt with appropriately .",
    "essentially all non - astronomical signals are generated internally by the electronics of the vla s antennas and ( to a lesser degree ) signals emanating from other sources on the vla site . by far",
    "the most common is a 100  khz `` comb '' generated by the vla s monitor and control system .",
    "the oscillators responsible for this are located in every antenna .",
    "the oscillators can be coherent , with low phase rates such that phase differentials of less than 1  radian are obtained in an integration time , so that the coherence is maintained over long periods of time .",
    "the result is spurious correlation , especially between certain pairs of antennas whose oscillators appear to maintain coherence regardless of where they are located in the array .",
    "the net ( averaged over frequency ) spurious visibility is not great ( @xmath26  jy ) and can be effectively removed in the spectral domain .",
    "( by contrast , rfi at  330  mhz is mainly externally generated but can be excised using the same procedures as described below . ) figure  [ fig : rfi ] ( left panel ) shows an example of the 100  khz `` comb '' for a single baseline .",
    "various procedures exist to accomplish rfi excision , depending upon the dynamic range requirements .",
    "notice that the final image dynamic range will also depend on the position of the source in the field , usually being lower closer to brighter sources , and how well ionospheric effects can be solved ( sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .",
    "rfi excision appropriate for moderate dynamic range images ( dr@xmath27 ) can be accomplished with the following procedure .",
    "one begins by identifying a `` baseline '' region within the spectrum to which only the astronomical source(s ) and the noise within the system ( i.e. , @xmath28 ) contribute .",
    "usually , this `` baseline '' region is non - contiguous and does not include the `` comb . ''",
    "next , visibilities with excessive amplitudes ( e.g. , @xmath29 ) are flagged , regardless of where they appear in the spectrum ( inside the baseline region or not ) . a linear fit to the `` baseline '' region",
    "is made and subtracted .",
    "the objective of this linear fit is to avoid ( or reduce ) the extent to which the flagging is biased by the astronomical source(s ) and the system .",
    "finally , visibilities whose residual values exceed a user - defined threshold ( typically 6@xmath30 ) are flagged in channels both inside and outside of the `` baseline '' region .",
    "the results of this procedure are presented in the right panel of figure  [ fig : rfi ] , where we show the example of the visibility spectrum on a baseline after rfi editing .",
    "an inspection of this image shows that this procedure has eliminated the rfi emission present in the left panel .",
    "a similar procedure , also appropriate for moderate dynamic range imaging , is to flag all of the channels comprising the 100  khz comb and then clip any remaining data with excessively large amplitudes .    while elementary , these approaches have proven to be reasonably effective in removing rfi at  74 ( and  330 ) mhz .",
    "additional tests also have been found to be useful .",
    "for instance , channels in which the ratio of the real part of the visibility to the imaginary part exceeds a given value can be flagged . various observers have noted that rfi can often be strongly circularly polarized so a test on the amplitude of the circular polarization ( stokes v parameter ) in each channel is also useful . for the highest dynamic range images ( dr@xmath31 ) , it is often necessary to inspect the data by hand and perform additional editing .",
    "@xcite describe in more detail post correlation rfi excision with the vla and vlba ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the limited spectral resolution of the vla s original correlator means that even the narrowest channels provided are 12  khz wide . as a result ,",
    "the procedure we describe can remove a significant fraction of the data  typically 10 to  25% .",
    "a key design goal of any future correlator would be to provide considerably more channels with higher frequency resolution , allowing much more precise removal of these artificial signals .",
    "such improvements are forthcoming for the 74 mhz system with the transition to the evla and its widar correlator .",
    "furthermore , techniques of pre - correlation rfi excision would clearly offer key advances over current approaches .",
    "a final note is that the discussion above focuses on narrow - band rfi , much of whose source is relatively well understood . since the sensitivity and dynamic range in the rarely used c and d configurations appears worse than attributable to confusion or poorly excised narrow - band rfi , we hypothesize that an additional form of low - level , broad - band rfi is limiting the system performance in those configurations .",
    "that suggests that the source of interference is the vla itself , or equipment at the site .",
    "clearly another lesson for future instruments is design them with a focus on eliminating or at least shielding against self - generated rfi .        despite relatively limited sensitivity compared to that typical of higher frequency observations ,",
    "the sensitivity of the 74  mhz vla is unprecedented for frequencies below  100  mhz , and so it has now become possible to obtain flux density measurements for thousands of radio sources that have never been measured before at these frequencies . however , it is important to note that flux density scales are rather uncertain below  100  mhz for several reasons .",
    "first , the galactic background dominates system noise temperatures , so system temperatures vary as an antenna is scanned across the sky and system gain and temperature must be measured continuously .",
    "antenna gains vary at less than the few % level as a function of time and are consistent with elevation dependent deformation of the feed or dish structure being negligible at 4-m wavelength .",
    "this trend is consistent with elevation - dependent gain variations at l - band ( 20-cm ) measured at less than 1% , while variations at p band ( 90-cm ) have never been seen . @xmath28",
    "certainly changes with time , as it depends on @xmath32 which is a strong function of sky position , being much greater on the galactic plane than off .",
    "early single antenna tests showed variations of up to a factor of 2 between `` on '' and `` off '' regions against the galactic plane - being greatest towards the galactic center .",
    "this is much less than the known contrast in brightness temperature between inner regions of the galaxy and cooler parts of the extragalactic sky as determined by early , lower resolution measurements ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however that real variation is diluted by the poor directivity of the 25-m dishes at 74 mhz , with @xmath3320% of the power in the main beam and the rest scattered in sidelobes across the sky .",
    "hence while @xmath28 does change as a function of time , the variation is greatly smoothed out and is normally less than a factor of two over the course of any pointed , full synthesis observations .",
    "a related consideration is that calibrator observations of calibrators like not drive the system response into a regime in which a non - linear correction of its correlation coefficient is required .",
    "fortunately the increase on @xmath28 when observing is modest .",
    "a rough estimate from existing low resolution sky maps suggests an increase in @xmath28 of @xmath3340% in the main beam alone , again consistent with early single antenna tests .",
    "thus the contribution from the distributed `` hot sky '' still dominates the measured power , and are consistent with the measurements described below indicating that variations in system gain and temperature are being tracked accurately ( see also sections 3 and 5.1 ) .",
    "second , many systems utilize fixed antennas whose power patterns are not very well determined . the relative flux densities of sources at adjacent declinations can be determined reliably because they traverse the same parts of the fixed antenna s pattern , but measurements of sources at widely separated declinations are difficult .",
    "also , many measurements must be made far from the maxima of the primary response patterns of the antennas , where the patterns are less stable than at the maxima .",
    "finally , ionospheric amplitude scintillations often disturb measurements below 50  mhz and ionospheric absorption can affect them below 20  mhz .",
    "the vla has features that avoid most of these problems .",
    "first , the gain and noise temperature of each antenna are monitored continuously by the injection of noise calibration signals into every preamplifier . at higher frequencies",
    ", experience has shown that the gain properties of the vla electronics system are stable at the 0.1% level , and that linearity is preserved even if the t@xmath34 changes by a factor of 3 or more .",
    "second , the vla antennas are pointed at each source under observation , and the antenna power pattern is stable , at least for measurements made near its center .",
    "sources at different declinations should be directly comparable .",
    "third , 74  mhz is a high enough frequency that ionospheric amplitude scintillations and absorption are minimal , though occasional episodes of scintillations have been seen during observations of strong sources .      because of the high system temperature of the 74  mhz system , the best source to use for calibrating the visibility amplitudes is .",
    "however , as it is partially resolved , a good model is required for accurate amplitude and phase calibration .",
    "we have used multiple observations in multiple vla configurations to generate such a model , and it is available online .",
    "we base our flux density scale on that of @xcite , in which has a flux density of  17086  jy at  74  mhz .",
    "although is by far the best amplitude calibrator , other sources can be employed , if necessary .",
    "is acceptable in all vla configurations , while and can be used in the smaller configurations . as with ,",
    "all of these sources are resolved significantly , so model images ( available online ) are necessary for calibration .",
    "the amplitude calibration is done in the usual way in aips , with the task calib used to derive the antenna complex gains .",
    "residual amplitude errors are corrected by self calibration in the final stages of the reduction . as described below",
    ", measurements demonstrate that reliable fluxes , at the 5% level , can be obtained down to the half power beam point . in the rare case of severe ionospheric weather conditions such as ionospheric scintillations (  [ sec : pdelay_motivate ] ) ,",
    "amplitude correction is not possible and the data are discarded .      in order to quantify our ability to cope in practice with the problems described above (  [ sec : ampcal1 ] ) , it is necessary to examine the robustness of the flux density scale for the vla . as part of a snapshot survey (  [ sec : example ] ) , we observed a number of strong sources , which we have used to constrain the gain stability of the 74  mhz system .",
    "@xcite presented the spectra of  518 extragalactic radio sources that have flux densities above  1  jy at  5  ghz , using data compiled from many catalogs .",
    "the absolute flux density scale was based on that of @xcite .",
    "although the data below  100  mhz are rather sparse , the spectra of @xcite have proven to be quite reliable in most cases .",
    "they do not include any sources near the galactic plane and give analytic expressions for spectra only when they are fairly simple ( straight or moderately curved ) .",
    "sources with complex spectra are included in the catalog , but no attempt was made to fit such spectra with analytic expressions .",
    "of the 29 sources in our snapshot survey , eleven have spectra for which @xcite give analytic expressions . table  [ tab : fluxscale ] compares our measured 74  mhz flux densities with the value predicted at  73.8  mhz from those expressions .",
    "( see also table  [ tab : list ] . )    because of their relatively simple structure even at the highest angular resolution , the four most reliable sources for comparison appear to be , , , and  .",
    "these yield an average flux density ratio ( vla/@xcite ) of  0.99 @xmath35 0.06 .",
    "a simple average of all eleven ratios yields 0.98 @xmath35 0.13 . in either case",
    "the agreement between the @xcite and vla flux density scales appears to be as good as 2% .",
    "we conclude that 74 mhz flux density measurements are stable at the few percent level , and that the absolute flux density scale as tied to the @xcite value for cygnus a is accurate to at least 5% .",
    "these results also confirm that antenna system temperatures and gains are being tracked correctly , and that power is being detected linearly .",
    "hence the 74  mhz flux scale is reliable for those sources never observed before at this frequency .",
    "however , @xcite give correction factors that should be used to adjust the data from the various catalogs to their flux density scale .",
    "when making comparisons , these corrections should be used .",
    "the phase calibration procedure employed commonly at centimeter wavelengths makes use of a secondary calibrator , a modestly strong source much closer in the sky to the target source than the amplitude calibrator .",
    "it is chosen to be strong enough to dominate the total flux within its field of view , so that a unique phase can be derived for the contribution of the array s electronics .",
    "in contrast , at  74  mhz the field of view is so large that few sources are strong enough to dominate the field .",
    "thus , an _ initial _ phase calibration is determined from ( or another strong source such as those listed above , ",
    "[ sec : ampcal ] ) , which usually provides sufficient coherence on enough short ( @xmath36  km ) baselines to form an initial image even if the target source is in a completely different portion of the sky .",
    "oftentimes , coherence is retained even after the phases are smoothed over long time scales , even longer than the duration of the observation .",
    "_ this technique works only for bright sources .",
    "implicit in this procedure is the assumption that a single phase suffices for the entire field of view  hence its _ angle - invariant _ designation .",
    "_    this initial phase calibration works because relatively larger scales ( @xmath37  km , i.e. , larger than the vla ) present in the ionosphere dominate the phase fluctuations .",
    "it is also the reason previous low frequency ( @xmath38  mhz ) systems with baselines less than about  5  km were able to function without ionospheric correction techniques  except for a constant refractive shift arising from the large - scale structures , short baselines ( @xmath39  km ) were , to first order , relatively unaffected by the ionosphere @xcite .",
    "the initial image obtained from this calibration must be subsequently astrometrically corrected and self - calibrated .",
    "we write the observed phase on a given baseline as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the phase contributed by the intrinsic structure of the source , @xmath42 is the phase contributed by the vla electronics , and @xmath43 is the ionospheric contribution .",
    "we write @xmath44 to emphasize that the phase is a function of time , not only because the earth - rotation synthesis means that the phase can change as the array samples different portions of the @xmath10-@xmath11 plane ( @xmath41 ) but also because of the temporal variations imposed by the ionosphere ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "can also be a function of time because of phase jumps in the electronics .",
    "these are sufficiently rare that we shall ignore them . ] during calibration observations of a strong source , the first term  @xmath41 can be calculated and removed using a model of the source , so we shall ignore it henceforth .",
    "the smallest scales in the ionosphere over which the rms phase varies by more than 1  radian at  74  mhz are typically no smaller than 5  km . as a result",
    ", the ionospheric phase term , @xmath43 , can be considered to be relatively constant across at least the short baselines in the array ( @xmath4  km ) .",
    "transferring the phases determined toward the calibrator source ( i.e. , ) to another direction in the sky introduces a term , @xmath45 , the ionospheric phase distortion toward the calibrator .",
    "however , for the short baselines , this term is effectively constant .",
    "it introduces little more than a refractive shift of the apparent source positions @xcite .",
    "this refractive shift can be removed by registering the image with an existing all - sky survey at a higher frequency ( i.e. , the nvss , @xcite ; wenss , @xcite ; and sumss , @xcite ) .    this initial , crude phase calibration is sufficient to produce an image .",
    "the initial image then serves as the initial model for hybrid mapping , which consists of iterative loops between self - calibration and imaging . with the large number of antennas in the full vla",
    ", convergence occurs rapidly . in this respect ,",
    "the process is similar to that employed often in very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) in which a crude initial model is combined with several iterations of hybrid mapping to produce the final image @xcite .",
    "phase self - calibration is warranted only if a sufficient signal - to - noise level can be obtained @xcite . in practice",
    "there are two signal - to - noise level thresholds that must be met , but both can be exceeded quite easily .",
    "the first signal - to - noise threshold that must be met is that there must be a source or sources that are strong enough to be detected in the approximate ionospheric coherence time ( @xmath46  min . ) .",
    "both an extrapolation of higher frequency source counts @xcite and source counts derived from 74  mhz observations indicate that there should be roughly 150  jy of flux from different sources within the primary beam , originating from sources stronger than about  5  jy , which is about  5 times the rms noise level obtained in a 1  min .",
    "integration time .",
    "the second signal - to - noise threshold is that the phase derived from the calibrator source must dominate over weaker sources in the field .",
    "this criterion can be understood by considering the calibrator , with a flux density  @xmath47 , to be immersed in a `` sea '' of randomly - located background sources , with a typical flux density  @xmath48 . treating the visibilities of the sources as phasors",
    ", the background sources will contribute to a jitter of the phase determined for the calibrator .",
    "a rough estimate of the magnitude of this jitter is @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the number of background sources in the field of view . for the purposes of a rough estimate",
    ", we take @xmath51 ( implying a phase jitter signal - to - noise threshold of  5 ) . with @xmath52  jy and @xmath53",
    ", we find @xmath54  jy .",
    "though clearly a rough estimate , experience has shown that it is possible to achieve successful phase self - calibration with as little as 50  jy from bright sources in the initial model .",
    "more generally , nearly every randomly - picked field of view will contain at least one 3c object ( or equivalent at southern declinations ) whose flux density alone is close to this minimum value , and existing all - sky surveys at higher frequencies can be used to identify the ( few ) strongest objects totaling at least 100  jy within the field of view .",
    "( the phase fluctuations in the top panel of figure  [ fig : ptlink ] are consistent with the estimate derived here for the phase jitter due to background sources . )    a potential weakness of this method is its limited utility to the larger configurations ( a and  b ) . depending upon the state of the ionosphere",
    ", it may be difficult or impossible to obtain sufficient signal - to - noise on the more limited number of short baselines . in turn",
    ", this may impair one s ability to produce an initial model for self - calibration .",
    "an alternate phase calibration strategy does not rely on the phases transferred from a distant source . instead ,",
    "a strong source , like , is used to establish the amplitude scale .",
    "an all - sky survey ( particularly the nvss or wenss ) is used to construct a sky model within the primary beam ; for sources north of declination  @xmath55 , the lower frequency wenss is preferable to .",
    "this sky model then serves as an initial model for self - calibration . in effect",
    ", no attempt is made to use an external calibrator to calibrate the phases .",
    "a primary benefit of this approach is to produce a map with astrometrically correct positions , as the coordinate system of the map is locked to the _ a priori _ known position of sources in the sky , while self - calibration with a model produced from raw data locks the final position to an arbitrary sky position determined by the position of the model or ionospheric refraction .",
    "this alternate strategy is a simplified application of the field based phase calibration technique , described in the next section .",
    "the prior calibration strategy is most useful at  74  mhz within a restricted field of view containing a strong source or strong sources located relatively close together . in this section",
    "we first motivate why phase angle independent self - calibration is insufficient for all observations , then describe the method we have developed to handle more general observations .",
    "the isoplanatic patch is the characteristic scale over which the rms phase difference between two lines of sight is approximately 1  radian . at low frequencies",
    "the size of the isoplanatic patch is determined primarily by the ionosphere .",
    "the phase contributed by a cold plasma is @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the classical electron radius , @xmath58 is the free - space wavelength , @xmath59 is the electron number density , and @xmath60 is the electron column density ( also known as the total electron column , tec ) . for reference , two lines of sight for which @xmath61  rad at  74  mhz would differ in electron column density ( tec ) by @xmath62  m@xmath63",
    ".    two lines of sight separated by the diameter of the primary beam pierce the f - layer of the ionosphere ( the most dense region of the ionisphere at an altitude of @xmath9400  km ) at a linear separation as large as 80  km .",
    "this is larger than the size of the array itself , even with the pt link , and the ionosphere can have significant column density variations at much smaller scales ( @xmath15  km ) , so the primary beam typically includes multiple isoplanatic patches .",
    "figure  [ fig : isoplane ] , which itself is a portion of a larger image , shows the effect of constructing an image larger than the isoplanatic patch .",
    "clearly evident is a systematic distortion of the sources attributable to incorrect phase calibration .",
    "figures  [ fig : ionshift][fig : ionsmall ] illustrate the successively higher order ionospheric effects that lead to the break - down of a simple angle - invariant self - calibration .",
    "figures  [ fig : ionshift ] and  [ fig : ionwedge ] shows the effects of the largest scale ( @xmath64  km ) ionospheric structure , a `` wedge '' that acts to shift the entire field of view , without source distortion , on time scales of minutes .",
    "this structure dominates the total electron content ( tec ) and also causes faraday rotation of linear polarization .",
    "a gps - based method to correct this effect has been demonstrated at the vla @xcite , but self - calibration alone can compensate for it if the time scale on which the phase corrections are calculated is sufficiently short to track this gross refraction .",
    "it will , however , leave the field with a gross astrometric offset from the correct source positions .",
    "figure  [ fig : iontid ] shows the phase effects imposed by ionospheric mesoscale structure .",
    "these mesoscale structures are due typically to traveling ionospheric disturbances ( tids ) , with scale sizes on the order of hundreds of kilometers , column densities of order @xmath65  m@xmath63 and periods less than 90 minutes . while the size of the vla  even in its a configuration  is smaller than that of a tid , it is still sufficiently large that tids can impose a ( mainly ) linear phase gradient down the arms of the .",
    "the effect of this linear phase gradient can be seen as a ( nearly ) linear increase in the phase with increasing distance from the array center ; the amplitude of the offset also increases with baseline , as the antenna separation becomes a larger fraction of the .",
    "( in the example shown in figure  [ fig : iontid ] , the traveling nature of the disturbance is also present as a lag between the times when the maximum phase offset is obtained at the various antennas . )",
    "self - calibration can remove the effects of tids only for a limited region in the field of view . at",
    "any given instant , sources outside this region are `` differentially refracted '' or shifted by varying amounts in proportion to their distance from nominal direction of the self - calibration solution . because a typical observation lasts much longer than the time it takes a tid to pass over the array , the differential refraction changes with time .",
    "thus , sources in a map made using all of the data are blurred as well .",
    "@xcite conducted an extensive study of acoustic gravity wave generated tids having phase speeds less than 200  m  s@xmath66 and periods greater than @xmath67  s using the vla at  330  mhz .",
    "they found them to have a quasi - isotropic distribution in azimuth . on shorter time scales ( @xmath68  s ) they found the ionospheric phase effects to be dominated by faster ( @xmath69  m  s@xmath66 ) magnetic eastward - directed disturbances ( meds ) . over the baseline relevant to the extended vla configurations and the pt link ( @xmath70  km ) , both tids and meds",
    "contribute to  74  mhz phase effects .",
    "figure  [ fig : ionsmall]a - f were obtained from an 8 hour observation towards a strong source ( virgo a ) , and illustrate a variety of effects due to ionospheric phenomena typically observed at the vla on scales sizes both larger and smaller than tids .",
    "figures  [ fig : ionsmall ]  a and b illustrate first order effects on the visibility phase towards virgo a. figures  [ fig : ionsmall ]  c and d track the flux density and apparent position of virgo a , while figures  [ fig : ionsmall ]  e and f reflect differential refraction towards five field objects after the first order term has been removed .",
    "these differential phase effects due to smaller scale ionospheric structures , on scales of tens of kilometers , are the most intractable and pose a major challenge for future instruments .",
    "( the high frequency `` jitter '' superposed on the tid - produced structure in figure  [ fig : iontid ] is also contribution from smaller scale structure . )",
    "these phase effects are generated by turbulent structures comparable to or smaller than the size of the vla , and lead to source distortion .",
    "there is no current means of correcting for these effects over a wide field of view and when they are severe , the data must be discarded . if these small - scale structures generate phase distortions larger than 1  radian on scales smaller than the size of the vla antennas , the result is ionospheric scintillations ( also illustrated in figure 14 ) .",
    "we believe that there will never be a means for compensating for this effect , at least so far as imaging applications are concerned , as the data are effectively smeared in phase before they arrive at the antennas .",
    "( ionospheric scintillations can be useful for studying the ionosphere itself , though . )",
    "fortunately ionospheric scintillations are rare at the vla at  74  mhz , but when they do occur those portions of the data must be removed .    in principle , a data - adaptive calibration scheme , based on self - calibration , could be used to remove the phase errors that result from imaging a region larger than the isoplanatic patch .",
    "current implementations of self - calibration model the phase error on the @xmath71 antenna at time  @xmath72 as a single quantity , @xmath73 , equivalent to assuming that the isoplanatic patch has an infinite extent above the array . the key assumption for self - calibration  that errors can be modeled as being antenna - dependent  remains true for a data - adaptive scheme .",
    "thus , a joint multi - source self - calibration , in which the calibration correction would become a function of position on the sky , @xmath74 , seems possible .",
    "limited testing suggests that such a scheme could work , though it probably requires considerably better signal - to - noise than can be achieved with the vla ; no comprehensive attempt to implement and assess such a scheme has been performed yet . in principle",
    "such a technique might allow wide - field imaging across the full extent of the primary beam on the longest baselines allowed by natural limits of brightness temperature sensitivity ( for a related discussion , see also @xcite ) .",
    "when it is desired to image an entire field of view , the assumption of an infinite isoplanatic patch is no longer valid .",
    "the effects of such an assumption can be seen as a tendency to detect a larger number of sources toward the direction of the strongest source in the field @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : scbias ] illustrates this effect in a field containing ( @xmath75  jy ) .",
    "the density of sources across the field is clearly non - uniform . besides the effects of anisoplanaticity , which shows up at scales of 5 - 10@xmath76 ,",
    "the non - uniform density can also arise from two other related causes .",
    "first , if sufficiently high - order ionospheric distortions are present , they contribute to increasing phase errors at increasing distances from the effective phase center .",
    "sources at large distances will be blurred , thereby decreasing their brightnesses .",
    "second , figure  [ fig : wander ] demonstrates that the apparent source positions also wander over time . because the amount and direction of the wander can vary both over the field of view and with time , sources are smeared further and their brightnesses decrease further . only in the neighborhood of a strong source",
    "are the self - calibration solutions able to track the ionospheric phase distortions accurately .",
    "if one is interested in imaging only a strong source , the non - uniform distribution of sources is usually unimportant .",
    "if a field does not contain a strong source , the self - calibration solutions represent some `` average '' ionospheric phase distortion across the field .",
    "again , depending upon the scientific problem being attacked , using angle - independent self - calibration may be sufficient .",
    "compensation for higher order ionospheric phase distortions is required @xcite , when the entire field of view is of interest ( e.g. , in the vla low - frequency sky survey @xcite ) or when the object of interest is `` close '' to a strong source .",
    "the latter case happens fairly frequently given that the typical separation of 3c sources on the sky is approximately 8 , comparable to the size of the vla field of view .",
    "moreover , the dynamic range required to detect or image a weak source close to a strong source may impose much more stringent constraints on the need to determine the ionospheric phase than the approximate 1  radian criterion that we gave at the beginning of the previous section .    in such cases , we model the ionosphere as a phase - delay screen .",
    "we return to equation  ( [ eqn : visphase ] ) , assume that @xmath41 is calculable and can be removed , and expand the ionosphere term as @xmath77 here @xmath78 refers to the phase distortion introduced by low spatial frequency structures in the ionosphere while @xmath79 refers to high spatial frequency structures . in order to make a division between `` high '' and `` low '' spatial frequencies ( or `` long '' and `` short '' wavelengths ) we make a `` frozen - flow '' approximation in which the ionospheric structures are assumed not to change internally over the time it takes for them to be transported across the array . under this assumption ,",
    "spatial and temporal scales become equivalent .",
    "the smallest structures ( @xmath80  km ) are transported at speeds of order 100  m  s@xmath66 on time scales of order 100  s. we consider these to be high spatial frequencies .",
    "structures of  100  km or larger are transported across in time scales of order 15  min . ; these are low spatial frequencies .",
    "the large - scale structures are larger than even the maximum baselines of the a configuration .",
    "we therefore decompose the low - frequency ionosphere term into low - order zernike polynomials @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the zernike polynomial , @xmath83 is the coefficient of that polynomial , and the standard conditions apply that @xmath84 and @xmath85 is even .",
    "the @xmath86 terms account for the large - scale refractive shift of the field of view while the @xmath87 terms describe astigmatism or differential refraction within the field of view .",
    "the @xmath88 term is not used because it represents an overall phase advance or delay ( `` piston '' ) to which the interferometer is insensitive .",
    "we use zernike polynomials because they represent a class of polynomials orthogonal on a circle .",
    "thus , they are useful for representing distortions across the aperture of the array .",
    "table  [ tab : zernike ] summarizes the polynomials used .",
    "the methodology is quite similar to that used in adaptive optics systems in optical astronomy .",
    "one important difference between our use of the zernike polynomials and that in adaptive optics , however , is that these polynomials are used to describe wavefront errors in or near the aperture for the case of adaptive optics systems in optical astronomy whereas here they represent errors quite far from the aperture plane .    in order to derive the required corrections , snapshot images of sources in an `` astrometric grid '' are produced , and the offsets between the apparent and expected locations of sources in the astrometric grid are determined .",
    "the snapshots must be formed on short enough timescales so as to track the ionospheric phase variations , typically 1  min .  or shorter .",
    "both the nvss and wenss can be used to produce this astrometric grid as both are constructed at a high enough frequency and from a sufficiently large number of sources that the positions of sources within these catalogs is known to an accuracy much better than the synthesized beam at  74  mhz , even in the a configuration . from the source offsets , the coefficients of the zernike polynomials can be found in a least - squares minimization .",
    "figure  [ fig : zernike ] shows an example of a ( subset ) of an astrometric grid and the resulting @xmath78 over the vla for a particular observation .",
    "the snapshot images of the astrometric grid sources are useful only if two conditions are met .",
    "first , the ionosphere must be stable enough that sources are not defocused seriously but merely shifted from their expected positions by refraction .",
    "second , one must be able to determine @xmath42 prior to forming the snapshot images . as in  [ sec : pcal ] , the initial phase calibration is determined from observations of , or another primary calibrator . for a single source at a well - known position ,",
    "one need solve for only the @xmath86 terms describing an overall refractive shift . correcting for this global refractive shift should yield @xmath42 .",
    "if @xmath79 is non - negligible ( meaning that sources may be defocused ) , it will corrupt estimates of @xmath42 . because no phase calibration is performed during this strategy ( but see below ) , any errors in determining @xmath42 remain in the data during all subsequent processing .",
    "figure  [ fig : scunbias ] presents the same field as in figure  [ fig : scbias ] , only this time calibrated using this field - calibration strategy .",
    "the density of sources across the field is seen to be far more uniform .",
    "figure  [ fig : sf ] quantifies the improvement that the field - based calibration ; it shows the rms jitter in the apparent separations of pairs of sources of various separations .",
    "this rms jitter is a fairly direct measure of the refraction differences induced by the low spatial frequency ionospheric irregularities . for separations greater than 2@xmath89 ,",
    "the phase screen corrections dramatically reduce the jitter . also important",
    "is that the rms jitter shows no trends as distance from the phase center increases .",
    "one weakness in our current implementation of this strategy is that the ionosphere is modeled in a piece - wise fashion in time .",

    "work is ongoing to rectify this weakness .    in order to assess",
    "if ( or to what extent ) @xmath79 is corrupting our estimate of @xmath42 , we observe multiple times during the course of an observing run . by comparing or ,",
    "more often , averaging the various estimates of @xmath90 , we seek to minimize the contribution of @xmath79 to our estimate of @xmath91    we close this section with a few general comments on our choice of zernike polynomials and our implementation . from the work of @xcite",
    "showing that much of the ionospheric structure above the vla is in the form of waves , one might wonder if a fourier representation would not be more appropriate .",
    "we have chosen to use zernike polynomials to describe the ionospheric structures precisely because they were invented for the purpose of describing phase errors across a circular aperture . moreover , compared to a rectangular fourier transform , many fewer terms of zernike polynomials are required to describe the ionospheric phase fluctuations . given the limited sensitivity of the vla ,",
    "this criterion is quite important . finally ,",
    "although it is not yet contained within our implementation , a natural extension of our method would involve requiring the ionospheric phase corrections to be smooth in time . in order to impose this requirement ,",
    "one requires an orthogonal basis for the modeling since the interpolation in time is by interpolating the coefficients and this only works if the terms being interpolated are orthogonal .",
    "we emphasize that our division between @xmath78 and  @xmath79 is phenomenological and has the effect of making the division based on the order of the zernike polynomials used rather than on physical properties of the ionosphere .",
    "the range of spatial scales in the ionosphere implies that one could use higher - order zernike polynomials to decompose the phase distortions . in principle , by incorporating a sufficient number of zernike polynomials one could reduce @xmath79 to a sufficiently low level so as to be unimportant ; orders as high as 80 are not unusual for correcting large optical telescopes .",
    "however , the number of zernike coefficients that can be determined is limited by both the sensitivity of the system and the _ aperture _ distribution of the .",
    "the sensitivity of the vla is an issue because the field must be imaged on less than the ionospheric coherence time , which in turn depends upon the array configuration as the amount of phase contributed by the ionosphere can depend upon the baseline length ( figure  [ fig : iontid ] ) . in 1  min .",
    ", a coherence time appropriate for the b configuration , a typical field of view contains no more than 1520 sources strong enough to be detected ; for a configuration , a more typical coherence time is approximately 20  s. even during times of ionospheric quiescence , fewer than 10 sources may actually be detected ; during poor ionospheric `` weather '' conditions or when sidelobes from strong sources obscure weaker sources , the actual number detected with any confidence may be no more than 5 sources .",
    "hence , in order to avoid ( or minimize the occurrence of ) spurious zernike coefficients , we have restricted the modeling to only the @xmath92 terms .",
    "this model of the ionosphere is constructed anew every 12  min .",
    "the aperture distribution ( as opposed to the more traditional concerns in interferometry regarding the @xmath10-@xmath11 distribution ) is related to the range of spatial scales sampled in the ionosphere . in order to characterize large - scale ionospheric structures ( e.g. , tids ) that are of concern under typical `` weather '' conditions , only a modest number of pierce points through the ionosphere are required . in this respect",
    "the aperture distribution of the compact configurations ( c and  d ) provides adequate sampling of the relevant spatial scales , though such sampling is also often not needed because the array remains nearly coherent in these configurations .",
    "in contrast , in order to characterize smaller scale ionospheric structures , a high density of closely spaced pierce points is required , which in turn requires high spatial frequencies in the aperture plane , rather than in the @xmath10-@xmath11 plane . in the extended configuration ( a and  b )",
    ", the sparseness of the aperture distribution means that small spatial scales are hardly sampled at all .",
    "the design of future low frequency instruments may require a compromise between the good uv coverage important for imaging and the good aperture plane coverage that might be required to allow sufficient modelling of small scale ionospheric structure .      under especially severe ionospheric weather conditions ( with ionospheric phase rates on long baselines in excess of  1  deg  s@xmath66 )",
    ", it may become necessary to scale the 330  mhz ionospheric - induced phase rates , transfer , and remove them from the 74  mhz data stream @xcite . in practice , this dual - frequency ionospheric phase transfer technique has been required only rarely , as even in the a configuration phases transferred from a strong source anywhere in the sky retain sufficient coherence on enough short spacings to provide an initial model for self - calibration .",
    "subsequent iterations of self - calibration then improve the phases on the longer baselines . as with straight - forward self - calibration , phase transfer does not compensate for the main failing of self - calibration , which is the lack of an angular dependence on the antenna based phase solutions",
    ". however phase transfer may well be of great benefit to future low frequency instruments , especially those planned to operate at lower frequencies and longer baselines than the vla , such as the lwa @xcite and lofar ( kassim et al .",
    "therefore it is important that their design does not preclude the possibility of simultaneous observations at multiple frequencies .",
    "the previous sections illustrate successive schemes of ionospheric phase calibration that continue to evolve with real observational experience . a technique such as joint , multi - source self - calibration is required to realize the full potential of emerging larger low - frequency instruments such as the lwa and lofar but has yet to be developed and tested .",
    "other related appoaches to the calibration of large , low frequency arrays continue to be proposed and discussed @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab : ioncalib ] presents a simple overview of these evolving schemes ; the illustrations in cotton et al .",
    "( 2004 ) may help orient the reader with respect to the applicable geometries .",
    "in this section we summarize the essential procedures needed for effective imaging in the presence of effects that are particularly significant at these low frequencies .",
    "a key limitation to previous low frequency interferometers operating below 100 mhz has been the poor and confusion - limited sensitivity that arose from their low angular resolution .",
    "the high angular resolution of the larger ( a- and b- ) configurations of the vla provides some mitigation , but the poor forward gain of the antennas increases the confusion .",
    "in fact , two effects are at work , and we distinguish between _ classical _ confusion and _ sidelobe _ confusion .",
    "the former occurs when the density of sources within the synthesized beam becomes so large that they can not be separated ( e.g. , 1 source per every 10  beams is a common criterion for the onset of classical confusion ) .",
    "the latter results from the incompletely removed sidelobe response to bright sources .",
    "table  [ tab : confuse ] summarizes the classical confusion limits for the four vla configurations , where we have taken classical confusion to occur when there is one source per 10 synthesized beams . in order to estimate these classical confusion limits ,",
    "we have adopted a @xmath93-@xmath94 relation derived from existing 74  mhz observations , @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the areal density of sources , in units of deg@xmath63 , stronger than @xmath97  jy .",
    "strictly , this @xmath98-@xmath94 relation is valid only for flux densities",
    "@xmath99  jy , based on the flux densities of the sources from which it was determined . expectations of source densities , based on higher frequency source counts , suggest that this @xmath98-@xmath94 relation will tend to overestimate the confusion flux density levels , though , and estimates using source counts scaled from higher frequencies give similar results .",
    "even with the uncertainty in the low - frequency @xmath93-@xmath94 relation , the results presented in table  [ tab : confuse ] show that classical confusion is unlikely to limit the sensitivity of  74  mhz observations in the a configuration and probably not in the b configuration ( possibly only in crowded regions like the galactic center ) , but it is a serious factor for c- and d - configuration observations .",
    "sidelobe confusion results from the improperly subtracted response to bright sources both inside and outside the main field of view , and is exacerbated when those sources are unresolved by the synthesized beam .",
    "the dominant effect is often from the pathlogically brightest sources ( e.g. , , etc ) outside the main field of view whose emission `` rumble '' through the primary beam sidelobes .",
    "this problem is particularly severe for the 74  mhz vla because of the relatively small aperture ( @xmath100 ) and the sidelobes caused by the feed support structure .",
    "thus the primary antenna gain is low , the primary beam is large ( fwhm @xmath101 ) , and the sidelobe levels are high and asymmetric ( peak sidelobes are typically only 20  db down from the main lobe ) , with a large area of sky in the `` close - in sidelobe '' region ( figure  [ fig : beam ] ) .",
    "moreover , the receiver noise is a small fraction of the total system temperature , so objects all over the sky , including those seen through the sidelobes , produce measurable coherence . because of this `` signal - rich '' environment at  74  mhz , it is often necessary to image the entire primary beam and a small number of sources outside it .    competing factors mitigate the effects of sidelobe confusion , including delay beam and `` ionospheric '' smearing of the residuals of subtracted sources .",
    "nevertheless remaining artifacts from the few , strongest sources outside the main field of view often limit the sensitivity and dynamic range .",
    "sidelobe confusion can still dominate over classical confusion even in the more compact configurations , since in those cases the arc - minute size scale of the normally offending sources ( most notably , , , , , and ) prevents them from being resolved out , and hence their residual effects are worse .",
    "( the dominance of sidelobe confusion over thermal noise was indicated earlier in figures 7 and 8 and discussed in  [ sec : general ] . as noted earlier",
    ", the sensitivity in the compact configurations is worse than attributable to either form of confusion alone , and our hypothesis is that low - level , broad - band rfi , possibly self - generated , are limiting the performance .",
    "this situation is in direct contrast to that at centimeter wavelengths ( * ? ? ?",
    "figure  15 ) where the receiver temperatures dominate the sky temperature , a more uniform aperture illumination produces lower sidelobes , and the non - thermal spectra result in most sources being fainter than at low frequencies , so that only rarely does one have to contend with sources outside the primary beam .",
    "the standard two - dimensional fourier inversion of visibility data requires that @xmath102 where @xmath103 is component of the interferometric baseline in the direction of the source and @xmath104 is the field of view .",
    "this assumption is not valid for 74  mhz observations over any significant hour angle .",
    "consequently , inverting the visibility data requires either a three - dimensional fourier inversion or `` polyhedral imaging , '' in which the field of view is tessellated into facets over which the assumption of a two - dimensional inversion is valid ( e.g. , figure  [ fig : scunbias ] ) . for further details and examples ,",
    "see @xcite and @xcite . in general , polyhedral imaging is the more common technique .",
    "table  [ tab : facet ] gives general guidelines as to the size and number of facets required for acceptable polyhedral imaging over the entire primary beam . in constructing table  [ tab : facet ]",
    "we have made use of the criterion @xcite that the radius of a facet ( in radians ) should be @xmath105 where @xmath104 is the ( fwhm ) diameter of the synthesized beam ( @xmath106 for a baseline  @xmath107 ) .",
    "larger facets can be used to reduce the computational burden at the expense of increased phase errors at the edges of the facets .",
    "an alternate strategy , `` targeted faceting , '' exploits two aspects of the radio astronomical sky .",
    "first , the majority of the sidelobe confusion results from the strongest sources either inside or outside the primary beam .",
    "the variance in the flux density is given by the expectation value of @xmath108 , which because @xmath109 with @xmath110 ( equation  [ eqn : counts ] ) means that the variance is dominated by the strongest sources .",
    "second , most of the the sky remains largely dark ( empty of sources ) , even at these frequencies .",
    "based on these facts , instead of tessellating the entire primary beam , which would take a large amount of time and computer power , one makes use of _ a priori _ knowledge of the field of view , e.g. , from the nvss or wenss , to place small facets only where there are sources .",
    "we usually have a few hundred small facets per pointing . depending upon the sensitivity of one s image and the desired image",
    ", this strategy can produce a useful computational savings .",
    "recently , a new technique for wide - field imaging know as the `` w - projection '' has been proposed .",
    "it projects the intrinsically 3-d data onto a 2-d plane with an appropriate fernel - like convolution , and avoid the teidum involved with polyhedron imaging and targetted facetting .",
    "this technique is currently being tested at the vla @xcite .",
    "even with the relatively large synthesized beam , compared to that attainable at higher frequencies , accurate astrometry at  74  mhz is desired .",
    "the astronomical motivations are varied but include spectral index studies , for which one wants to align images obtained at different frequencies ( to the extent allowed by any frequency - dependent shifts within the source ) , and followup at other wavelengths , for which positional accuracies of 1  or better can be required .",
    "if self - calibration is used during phase calibration (  [ sec : pcal ] ) , self - calibration will `` freeze '' the large - scale refraction but leave the image with an arbitrary absolute position ( as in figure  [ fig : ionshift ] ) .",
    "the nvss or wenss sources that appear in the image can then be utilized to re - register the astrometry to an accuracy of approximately 5 . if the ionosphere is treated as a phase - delay screen (  [ sec : pdelay ] ) , the astrometric source grid used in the procedure results in source positions comparable to that of the survey from which the astrometric grid was constructed ( e.g. , a few arcseconds for nvss ) , provided that there are no other systematic effects .",
    "a potential operational improvement in conducting 74  mhz observations ( and low - frequency observations in general ) would be to determine when ionospheric conditions are sufficiently quiescent to make useful observations .",
    "currently , observations are scheduled on the telescope well in advance and proceed at the scheduled time .",
    "this procedure carries the risk that the ionosphere could be in a sufficiently disturbed state so as to preclude useful observations .",
    "a better approach would be to schedule the telescope in a `` dynamic '' fashion . in order to do this , one would have to conduct a test or identify a proxy observable that could establish the state of the ionosphere rapidly .",
    "if the ionosphere was disturbed so that 74  mhz observations would be unlikely to be successful , observations at a higher frequency could proceed with the 74  mhz observations being deferred until such time as the ionosphere is more amenable to correction via methods described here .",
    "our experience suggests a number of ways in which such dynamic scheduling could be implemented .",
    "in general , the ionospheric phase effects that dominate calibration issues at low frequencies are a manifestation of highly unpredictable ionospheric weather conditions .",
    "the key consideration for low frequency observations is not the total thickness of the ionosphere , as measured by the tec , but variations in tec such as tids and smaller scale ionospheric structures (  [ sec : pdelay_motivate ] ) .",
    "stable ionospheric conditions can occur at mid - day , when the tec is highest . at the same time",
    ", highly disruptive ionospheric scintillations can occur during the middle of the night .",
    "periods of particular ionospheric instability are [ after ] sunset and especially sunrise ( figure  [ fig : ionsmall ] ) , but it is often easy to avoid observations during these times",
    ".    solar activity can affect 74 mhz observations both directly , due to radio emission from the sun that occur during the daytime , and indirectly , from ionospheric turbulence generated by manifestations of space weather linked to solar activity that can occur any time of the day or night .    at  74  mhz",
    "the quiet is a benign 2  kjy disk ( compared to at  17  kjy ) , and , at 30  or larger in size , is significantly resolved out with the a and  b configurations .",
    "however , nonthermal solar radio noise [ storms ] can have flux densities in excess of  1  mjy , and by entering through the far - out sidelibes of the primary beam render observations completely incapable of being calibrated . however they are usually short - lived , on the order of 30 minutes or less , and can be excised from the data in way similar to the treatment of narrow - band rfi .",
    "the second direct effect is due to the scattering effects of the solar wind .",
    "these lead to asymetric angular broadening and distortion of the brightness distribution of observed sources , and the effects are worst in the a and b configuration when the angular resolution is highest .",
    "experience with both of these direct effects indicates that a useful rule of thumb is to allow at least 60 degree stand - off betweeen the target source and the sun .",
    "the indirect effects are more important since bad ionospheric weather conditions related to a geomagnetic storm precipitated by solar activity can persist for days and render observations useless throughout .",
    "one well known manifestation are the massive solar ejections of plasma and magnetic field known as coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) .",
    "energetic earth - ward directed cmes take 20 to 48 hours to arrive and , given a suitable magnetic field orientation , their impact can transfer massive amounts of energy into the upper atmosphere .",
    "the resulting geomagnetic storms can damage satellites , knock out power grids , and disrupt communications .",
    "ionospheric disturbances of terrestrial origin , for example acoustic gravity waves can also generate ionospheric variations and poor low frequency observing conditions .",
    "however the most severe ionospheric disturbances are usually associated with solar activity .    various spacecraft and ground - based observatories monitor the sun , and indices exist to quantify the level of solar and geomagnetic activity .",
    "hence proxies exist to predict both direct and indirect effects of solar and geomagnetic activity , and in principle these could be used to provide an `` ionospheric weather '' forecast to guide low frequency observations .",
    "however no systematic effort has been conducted yet to assess the correlation between various indices and satisfactory ionospheric imaging conditions . in the mean time , the self - calibration solution , or short time scale stability of the phase on a few baselines from a short scan on a strong 74  mhz source ( , ) is the most useful means of determining whether ionospheric weather conditions are suitable for observations . if they are deemed too poor to observe , the observations should be postponed , and conditions revisited on the timescale of several hours , or sooner if monitoring of strong sources can be efficiently built in to a dynamic scheduling system .",
    "only limited attempts have been made to quantify the usefulness of this latter approach ; while this procedure appears useful , it may not be able to distinguish excellent ionospheric imaging conditions from only fair conditions .",
    "the 74  mhz system expanded from an initial trial system to an operational component of the .",
    "even so , its sensitivity is limited fundamentally by the vla s modest collecting area ( @xmath111  m@xmath14 , which translates to @xmath112  m@xmath113 given the @xmath915% aperture efficiency at this frequency ) and poor sensitivity . even if the vla telescopes could be made 50% efficient , and the bandwidths increased significantly (  [ sec : general ] ) , it is not possible for the vla ( or the evla or the gmrt ) to be more sensitive in plausible integration time ( @xmath114 10 hrs ) than roughly 1  at 74  mhz100 times less sensitive than at  1400  mhz to normal - spectrum objects ( i.e. , those with spectral indices @xmath115 , @xmath116 ) .    the only way to achieve a sensitivity at these wavelengths comparable to that available at centimeter wavelengths is to build a system with much greater collecting area .",
    "the long wavelength array ( lwa , @xcite ) , low - frequency array ( lofar , @xcite ) and mileura widefield array ( mwa , @xcite ) seek to accomplish this at different levels , with different collecting areas , spatial resolutions and frequency ranges .",
    "the objective of these projects is to produce aperture synthesis instruments , operating at frequencies between  10 and  300  mhz , with collecting areas of up to @xmath117  m@xmath14 at  20  mhz with maximum baselines of up to 500  km or longer . as such",
    ", they would have considerably more collecting area than the vla ( and more than any other previous low - frequency telescope as well ) and angular resolutions comparable to that of the vla at frequencies near  1  ghz .    these projects must take into account the lessons learned from previous low frequency instruments .",
    "here we emphasize some of these lessons , which became apparent during the deployment of the 74  mhz vla system :    * the system should be designed with careful attention to the signals it emits so that the instrument does not pollute itself with . *",
    "the complex gain and noise temperature of each antenna should be monitored continuously .",
    "measurements of the round - trip phase through the system should also be available .",
    "* channel bandwidths should be kept small ( @xmath118 ) so as to avoid strong terrestrial transmitters as often occur at low frequencies and to enable wide - field imaging .",
    "* wide - band receiving systems should be employed so that more than a single frequency can be observed .",
    "compare the vla to the clro in figures  [ fig : resolution ] and  [ fig : sensitivity ] .",
    "* large , well - filled primary collectors ( presumably composed of numerous individual dipole antennas phased together ) should be used so as to produce a primary beam with high forward gain .",
    "* ionospheric calibration should be considered during the design of the array . in particular",
    ", adequate ionospheric calibration may require good _",
    "aperture_-plane coverage , rather than good @xmath10-@xmath11 plane coverage usually sought in synthesis imaging .",
    "also , the ability to make simultaneous measurements at widely spaced frequencies ( for phase transfer ) and pointing positions ( for modelling the ionosphere over the array ) should be available . rapid ( < 10sec ) switching may suffice over true simultaneous measurements , given sufficient sensitivity to track ionospheric changes on short time scales .",
    "we have described the 74  mhz system that is installed on the nrao very large array and the pie town antenna of the very long baseline array .",
    "all 29 antennas have been outfitted with 74  mhz receivers . with these low - frequency receivers and in the vla s a configuration , the vla is the world s highest resolution , highest dynamic range interferometer operating below  150  mhz .",
    "working in conjunction with the pt antenna , the vla - pt interferometer , with baselines approaching 70  km , represents the longest baselines ever used for connected element synthesis imaging below  150   mhz .    the calibration strategy for the 74  mhz vla incorporates a number of features not common at higher frequencies .",
    "chief among these is the importance of the isoplanatic patch size relative to the primary beam diameter . at  74  mhz ,",
    "the isoplanatic patch size is determined by the ionosphere and the size of the array , particularly in its larger configurations , and can be smaller than the primary beam .",
    "we have developed new _ field - based _ methods of calibrating 74  mhz vla data that are not restricted to assuming that a single phase correction must apply to the entire field of view . for certain types of observations ,",
    "e.g. , a field dominated by a single strong source that itself is the object of interest , normal , position - independent self - calibration ( such as is used at centimeter - wavelengths ) can be employed to obtain images with reasonable dynamic ranges .",
    "we have presented snapshot images of 3c sources of moderate strength as examples of routine , angle - invariant calibration and imaging , and a sub - sample of these sources with previously well determined low frequency spectra indicate that the 74 mhz flux scale at the very large array is stable and reliable to at least 5 percent .",
    "the absolute flux density scale is tied to a model of cygnus a with a flux density fixed to the @xcite value .",
    "other aspects of calibration and imaging are not unique to 74  mhz but assume greater importance relative to higher frequencies .",
    "for instance , at  1400  mhz one can observe in a pseudo - continuum mode ( i.e. , low spectral resolution mode ) in order to maintain a large field of view , to identify rfi , or both . at  74  mhz ,",
    "the internal rfi is sufficiently bad that a pseudo - continuum mode ( with somewhat higher spectral dynamic range than used typically at  1400  mhz ) is essential .",
    "similarly , at  1400  mhz there are typically other sources in the field of view , and it is possible for there to be strong sources outside the field of view that must be cleaned in order that their sidelobes do not reduce the dynamic range in the image . at  74  mhz , the presence of many sources in the field of view and of strong sources outside the field of view is guaranteed .",
    "although we expect that the 74  mhz system will continue to be a productive , `` facility - level '' system of the vla ( and evla ) for many more years , we also anticipate that the 74  mhz system will be superseded eventually by lofar and the lwa and possibly the low - frequency end of the square kilometer array ( ska ) .",
    "nonetheless , we believe that it offers many lessons for these future high resolution telescopes , as well as the apparatus to explore new science in its own right .    we have benefited from discussions with many individuals .",
