    "in the standard model of star formation the magnetic field plays the major role in the support of dense cores against gravitational contraction ( e.g. shu , adams , & lizano 1987 ) .",
    "while the mechanism for the magnetic support may be direct support by the field and/or by turbulent motions induced by the field , it is certain that the magnetic field can only directly influence the motions of charged species inside the cloud .",
    "thus the majority of gas mass , residing in neutral species , is only influenced via collisions with the ionized species , and the level of ionization inside the core becomes a critical factor in the dynamics of the star formation process .",
    "the standard model has predominantly focused on the formation of low mass stars , because these objects sometimes form in an isolated fashion and , therefore , are easier to study individually . in this model",
    "the diffusion of magnetic flux inside the core is controlled by the ionization fraction through ion - neutral collisions , or ambipolar diffusion , and the initially magnetically subcritical core evolves to the supercritical state and collapse ensues ( e.g. mckee et al . 1993 ) .",
    "however , the majority of star formation ( both high and low mass ) does not occur in an isolated fashion .",
    "instead most stars generally form in clusters or aggregates ( lada & lada 1991 ; zinnecker , mccaughrean , & wilking 1993 ) . thus",
    ", the standard model of star formation may not be applicable to most stars .",
    "in particular , the enhanced radiation fields in regions of cluster formation may increase ion abundances and , therefore , the coupling of the magnetic field to the gas .",
    "star formation may , therefore , require a different formation mechanism .",
    "to examine the coupling of the magnetic field to the gas in dense cores we have undertaken an observational and theoretical study to survey the ionization fraction in dense cores with a variety of star forming properties . in the companion paper to this work , williams et al .",
    "( 1998 ; hereafter paper i ) , we combined observations of molecular neutrals and ions with chemical theory and determined electron abundances inside an isolated sample of low mass cores .",
    "we found that the ionization fraction ( @xmath10 is typically @xmath11 and shows no difference between cores with embedded stars and those without ( see also caselli et al .",
    "this value is in agreement with previous estimates of the ionization fraction in gulin , langer , & wilson ( 1982 ) and wootten et al .",
    "( 1982 ) , which were based on observations of fewer cores and on less detailed chemical models .",
    "in this paper we extend upon the previous work by deriving the ionization fraction in cores located in the l1641 and l1630 molecular clouds  two regions that are currently forming stellar clusters ( e.g. lada et al .",
    "1991a ; strom , strom , & merrill 1993 ) .",
    "the molecular cores in these regions have properties that are typically associated with clouds forming high mass stars and stellar clusters in that they are generally larger , more massive and turbulent , than the low mass cores observed in paper i.    using a set of consistent assumptions and the same chemical model , we will compare the fractional ionization of these objects with their low mass counterparts . with",
    "the addition of previously determined ionization fractions in even more massive star forming sites in de boisanger et al .",

    "5 discusses the implications of these results on field - gas coupling and on the stability of molecular cores .",

    "a census of young stars in the l1630 cloud finds that between 5496% of the stars in the cloud are grouped into dense stellar clusters ( lada et al .",
    "1991a ) . a more recent j , h , and k photometric search for a population of stars on the edges of l1630 finds little evidence for a distributed population ( li , evans , & lada 1997 ) .    within l1641 and l1630",
    "we have chosen sources based upon the iras - selected nh@xmath17 survey of harju , walmsley , & wouterloot ( 1993 ; hereafter hww ) who mapped the  @xmath18 and @xmath19 emission in dense cores associated with iras point sources . in some instances , while mapping  emission around iras sources , hww found local maxima in the  emission maps that were apparently unassociated with star formation activity .",

    "( 1993 ) and we have used their observations to perform a deeper search for associated embedded stars .",
    "we find that all infrared sources coincident with core ( b ) have colors consistent with those of background stars seen through the edges of the core , although there is a 3.6 cm continuum source ( without a near - ir counterpart ) that is on the edge of the emission region ( anglada et al .",

    "hww presented a comparison of the properties of cores found in orion with those in the taurus molecular cloud .",
    "they demonstrate that the orion cores have masses , sizes , and velocity line widths that are more than a factor of two higher than the taurus cores . among our sample of the hww orion cores the average radius and temperature is 0.16 pc and 15 k , respectively .",
    "the low mass cores in paper i have an average radius of @xmath20 0.09 pc , with an average temperature of 10 k ( benson & myers 1989 ) .",
    "furthermore , the character of stars forming within our sample of orion cores is distinctly different when compared to those in paper i. the median infrared luminosity of the stars in the orion sample ( as derived from iras ) is @xmath21 @xmath22 , as compared to a median of @xmath203 @xmath22 for stars associated with the cores observed in paper i. the low mass cores are also primarily associated with one or no star , while the orion cores are in a region where cores form single stars or small groups of @xmath23 .",
    "these characteristics also distinguish our sample of orion cores ( and the low mass cores ) from even more massive objects such as omc-1 in orion or w3 .",

    "as discussed in detail in paper i , the determination of electron abundances from observations of molecular ions requires information on the physical structure of the cloud , in particular the density and temperature of the gas probed by the respective tracers .",

    "the best fit models are presented in table  [ csden ] and show that the densities of the gas probed by cs are typically @xmath60 .",
    "the density uncertainty is also listed in table 5 and this value is based on the observed baseline rms noise , and an assumed systematic uncertainty of 30% .",
    "one concern is that the density is derived on the basis of two adjacent rotational transitions that may not be sensitive to material with a density much greater than the critical density of the  transition .",
    "we can attempt to address these questions by comparison to other measurements in the literature .",
    "one core ( iras05399 ) was included in a multitransitional cs study in lada , evans , & falgarone ( 1997 ) who detected emission from the  transition .",

    "the large difference between cs and dust continuum density measurements in iras05399 may be due to the higher resolution of the dust continuum observations ( @xmath37 ) , which will result in greater sensitivity to warmer , denser , material close to iras05399 .",

    "we have adopted the method described in paper i. in particular , we vary both physical parameters and atomic abundances in the chemical model to match observed abundances of molecular ions and column density ratios and derive electron fractions . the chemical model is described in bergin & langer ( 1997 ) and uses the pure gas - phase reaction network from millar , farquhar , & willacy ( 1996 ) .",

    "the density in these sources is constrained by the emission analysis discussed in section 4.1 to lie within a range of @xmath87 , and we adopt @xmath88  for our analysis . the visual extinction within a  beam can be determined using the  column densities provided in table  [ colden ] . if we assume that [ ] / [ ] @xmath89 ( based on direct h@xmath14 and co measurements in lacy et al .",

    "i , to constrain the range of potential cosmic ray ionization rates , we balanced the heating due to a variable cosmic ray flux with the molecular line cooling calculations of neufeld , lepp , & melnick ( 1995 ) and goldsmith & langer ( 1977 ) for a cloud temperature of 10 k. a similar analysis allowing for temperatures as high as 1520 k suggests that ionization rates between @xmath93 s@xmath25 will heat the gas to temperatures that lie within the allowed range . we have therefore performed model runs with @xmath94 1 , 5 , 10 , and 15 @xmath95 s@xmath25 .",
    "this was done for all permutations of varied parameters ( i.e. density , temperature , initial atomic abundances ) . from these models we found that @xmath96 s@xmath25 best reproduced the observations and we have adopted this value for the remainder of this paper .",
    "this value of @xmath97 is consistent with the value found in paper i for low mass cores .",
    "additional parameters in our model are the initial abundances of carbon , oxygen , nitrogen , and heavier `` metal '' atoms . as in paper",
    "i we alter the initial chemical abundances from fiducial values which represent abundances typically used for theoretical chemical models .",
    "these fiducial conditions have c , o , and n with mild depletions with respect to solar ( factor of 23 ) , and the heaver species ( mg , fe , s .... ) depleted by several orders of magnitude from solar values . thus the fiducial set of initial atomic abundances are already depleted from solar and we will raise and lower our initial model abundances from these fiducial values .",
    "we use the same fiducial set of abundances as given in paper i. for each set of parameters ( density , temperature , cosmic ray flux , etc . )",
    "the abundances of metal ions are varied from 1/10 to 150 times the normal value .",
    "for a given cosmic ray ionization rate this will effectively raise and lower the ionization level respectively .",
    "upon comparison with observations we found that only a small range of factors between 2  10 times fiducial values is required . to account for variable depletions in the carbon and oxygen pools",
    "the carbon and oxygen abundances were also varied from 0.5 to 1.2 times the fiducial values .",
    "we also varied the nitrogen abundance and found that it does not affect the derived @xmath7 .    in summary ,",
    "perhaps one of the greatest uncertainties in the calculation of theoretical chemical abundances is the large number of variables involved in the calculation . in this work",
    "we have attempted to avoid this obstacle by computing over 600 model runs covering as many permutations of the parameter space as possible .",
    "where possible we have used observations to constrain particular variables . in the following section",
    "we demonstrate that a reasonable range of these parameters can cover the observed spread in the data  and allow for an estimation of electron abundances in these cores .",
    "a compilation of the chosen model parameters for our `` best fit '' model is provided in table  [ tab_model ] .",
    "figure  [ highlow ] plots the abundance of  relative to co against the deuterium fractionation ratio : [ ] / [ ] for our sample of orion cores ( as open diamonds ) . also shown as solid dots are the same ratios for low mass cores taken from paper i. comparing our data to the low mass cores shows general agreement in the same overall range of  abundances .",
    "however , the level of fractionation in deuterium is slightly different : the majority of massive cores have very low deuterium fractions ( log@xmath6([]/ [ ] ) @xmath98 ) . moreover , the two cores with the lowest fractionation ratios have outflows that are traced by cs emission .",
    "figure  [ model ] overlays the best - fit chemical models on the orion core data ( same axes as figure  [ highlow ] ) .",
    "vertical lines in figure  [ model ] indicate the model temperature , whereas the horizontal contours denote the log of electron abundance ( log@xmath99 ) .",
    "this family of models has @xmath100 , @xmath101 , carbon and oxygen abundances depleted by 20% from the nominal values ( see table 6 ) .",
    "the cores containing stars are plotted as filled circles and starless sources are open circles . as in paper",
    "i the vertical spread in the data is accounted for by variations in metal ion abundances .",
    "the line for log@xmath102 in figure  [ model ] corresponds to 2 times the fiducial metal abundances and the line for log@xmath103 corresponds to 10 times the fiducial values .",
    "thus the range of our observations requires only a small variation in metal abundances . as the fiducial abundances are already heavily depleted from the observed abundances in diffuse clouds ( and even more so from solar values )",
    "our results still require highly depleted metals .",
    "the electron abundances derived for the surveyed orion cores are determined on the basis of the best fit model shown in figure  [ model ] .",
    "values are given in table  [ colden ] along with the maximum and minimum abundances derived from the model and the 1 @xmath75 observational errors in the ratios .",
    "there is one major difference between the models presented here and those constructed for low mass cores ( paper i ) . the range of densities observed in low mass cores allowed us to fit models with constant temperature and a small range of c and o depletions ( 0.5 to 1.2 times the fiducial values ) .",
    "however , the densities in the massive cores are constrained to a fairly narrow range , with most falling around 10@xmath104 cm s@xmath25 ( table 5 ) . at this",
    "density models similar to those presented in paper i are unable to reproduce the low [ ] / [ ] ratios observed in some cores . for a fixed temperature the lowest ratios require high carbon and oxygen abundances , to a degree that is inconsistent with observed depletions towards diffuse clouds .",
    "moreover the orion cores observed here are much denser than diffuse clouds and should , if anything , show larger depletions .",
    "temperature variations within the sample of massive cores offer a simple solution to account for the observed differences . the main reaction that forms  ( and eventually ) is :    @xmath105    the forward reaction ( formation of ) is favored at low temperatures , but once the temperature becomes greater than @xmath2020 k the reverse reaction will begin to contribute significantly and",
    "the [ ] / [ ] ratio will be lowered .",
    "therefore , we account for the range of [ ] / [ ] ratios in figure  [ model ] by varying the temperature from 15 k to 30 k ( vertical lines ) .",
    "we believe this explanation is plausible because the cores that contain stars and molecular outflows have the lowest fractionation ratios , whereas the starless cores have [ ] / [ ] ratios close to those observed in the colder low mass cores ( paper i ) . a similar analysis of deuterium fractionation in a wide range of cores by wootten et al .",
    "( 1982 ) also suggests that temperature variations are necessary to account for the observed differences .",
    "carbon and oxygen depletion is still a variable in the model calculations .",
    "as demonstrated in paper i changes in the carbon and oxygen depletion can alter the electron fraction ( a depletion of 25% from the normal values raises @xmath7 by @xmath10625% ) .",
    "the best fit to our data requires an additional depletion of 20% from the nominal values of [ c]/ [ ] = @xmath107 and [ o]/ [ ] = @xmath108 . however , our data are consistent with c and/or o depletions of 50% and enhancements as high as 125% , provided that the temperature is still a variable .",
    "chemical models of the orion ridge near the trapezium cluster , a region that is quite unique compared to the rest of the orion cloud , suggest that oxygen atoms might be more depleted than carbon atoms ( giving higher c / o ratios : bergin et al .",
    "in addition a recent compendium of oxygen depletion measurements from the goddard high resolution spectrometer suggests that the total oxygen abundance is homogeneous in the solar vicinity and is two - thirds of the solar value ( meyer , jura , & cardelli 1998 ) .",
    "given the best fit c and o abundances , and the range of allowed depletions in the models , our results do not disagree with the chemical models of the orion ridge or with the recent oxygen measurements .",
    "within the observational and theoretical errors ( estimated to be a factor of 4 ; see discussion in  5.3 ) our electron abundances are consistent with those estimated by wootten et al .",
    ". however , our paper uses a direct comparison to chemical models , with associated improvements in reaction rates .",
    "another study observed several molecular ions and neutrals , and with comparison to current equilibrium chemical models , derived electron abundances in several massive star forming cores ( de boisanger et al .",
    "their chemical models are similar to ours in the sense that the cosmic ray flux is constant for an entire cloud ( or complex ) , but their sources contain a significantly larger amount of mass and are located near o and b clusters .",
    "our approach of fixing the ionization rate is different from that found in caselli et al .",
    "( 1998 ) who derived electron abundances for a sample of low mass cores ( mostly in taurus and ophiuchus ) .",
    "caselli et al .",
    "( 1998 ) used the cosmic ray ionization rate as a true variable parameter in their analysis and account for the spread in [ ] / [ ] and [ ] /[co ] ratios through an intrinsic variation of the cosmic ray flux from core to core .",
    "our analysis takes the flux of cosmic rays as a variable only to fit the entire sample .",
    "slight differences in temperature between cores can account for the changes in deuterium fractionation between the different cores .",
    "since our small sample of cores is located solely in the orion complex , it is likely that the exteriors of these cores are bathed in a similar cosmic ray flux . a single value for the cosmic ray flux for a region several parsecs in size is also supported by the large - scale consistency of the diffuse gamma - ray emission , which is believed to originate from cosmic ray interactions with matter , with the large - scale distribution of the ism ( see bertsch et al . 1993 and references therein ) .    an important source of concern in our models is the requirement that metal ions vary in abundance among our small sample of cores by a factor of 6 .",
    "as noted in  4.2 this small variation still implies that metal abundances are heavily depleted from diffuse cloud values .",
    "such a variation could be found if these cores have slightly different density structures and formation histories . in this regard",
    "it is encouraging that the electron abundances and predicted metal depletions in the two sources with multiple cores are quite similar .",
    "another complication is that the non - linear character of chemical equations has been shown to give rise to multiple solutions with high- and low - ionization phases ( le bourlot , pineau des forts , & roueff 1995 ) .",
    "these solutions are found to be dependent on the initial conditions .",
    "thus , the fractional ionization may not be uniquely determined from the molecular column density ratios used here . however , in our models we have examined a large fraction of the parameter space ( abundances of metals , cosmic ray ionization rate , temperature , and density ) . in all , over 1200 models were run for this paper and in paper i to find the the best match to the data . in no case was a bistable solution found and our results are consistent with the low - ionization phase ( see plume et al .",
    "finally , the non - inclusion of gas - grain interactions could be important . for a detailed discussion of these effects and other possible sources of electrons the reader",
    "is referred to the discussion in paper i.      in terms of electron abundances and the radiation field there are two possible effects .",
    "one concern is that the local radiation from an associated young star may heat the surrounding molecular envelope and produce a gradient in the deuterium fractionation along the line of sight .",
    "in contrast the  abundance will not be as strongly affected .",
    "using figure  [ model ] we can attempt to quantify these effects . along a line of constant [ ] /[co ] , the derived electron fraction increases by a factor of 1.6 as the deuterium fractionation ratio declines .",
    "thus , a gradient in d - fractionation will result in an overestimation of the actual electron abundance .    for most cases",
    "we have avoided this particular concern by performing our analysis along lines of sight away from the stellar position . the analysis for one source , iras053890756a ,",
    "is performed near the position of the iras source and it is possible that this could affect our determination of the electron abundance . if we examine figure  [ model ] the [ ] / [ ] ratio for iras05389 core ( a ) , which is near the ir source , and core ( d ) , which is apparently unassociated with star formation , are nearly identical .",
    "this suggests that , for this source at least , such line of sight effects may not be a dominating factor . to probe this question",
    "further we can compare the [ ] / [ ] ratio computed at the stellar position with a single position away from the source for all surveyed cores .",
    "we find that , on average , the change is 20% in the direction of lower fractionation .",
    "a typical statistical error in the d / h ratio is @xmath109% which suggests that , on average , this effect is not important at the observed spatial resolution .",
    "one source , iras053020537 , one of the more luminous stars in our sample ( @xmath110 ) , shows a 67% decrease .",
    "thus , there is some ( inconclusive and limited ) evidence of this effect .",
    "a larger sample of sources and data with greater spatial resolution and sensitivity will be required to examine this question in more detail .",
    "a second potential effect is from the external radiation field .",
    "mckee ( 1989 ) showed that for a homogeneous gas layer illuminated by the normal interstellar radiation field , cosmic ray ionization and photoionization contributed equally at @xmath111 .",
    "we have investigated the effects of the radiation field on our chemical calculations by lowering the visual extinction or , equivalently , raising the external uv field .",
    "since these cores are located in the orion cloud , which have several local sources of intense radiation ( e.g. genzel & stutzki 1989 ) , we have investigated raising the uv radiation field by a factor of 500 .",
    "we find that our results are unaltered .",
    "raising the uv field to @xmath112 corresponds to lowering the visual extinction to @xmath113 ( depending on the molecular photoabsorption cross - section ) , and at these depths co molecules are still partially shielded from radiation .",
    "it is important to note that our models do account for the self - shielding of co.    we have further investigated the effect of the radiation field by comparing the [ dco@xmath114/[hco@xmath114 ratio and the h@xmath12co@xmath115 abundances in the core edges to those found in the center .",
    "the separation between the core edges and center is defined as the contour at which the dco@xmath115 j = @xmath116 integrated intensity is equal to half the peak value . for a particular molecule ,",
    "all spectra that lay in the `` edge '' region ( @xmath117 ) were combined to produce a single `` edge '' spectrum whereas those that fell in the `` center '' were combined to produce a single `` center '' spectrum . in this fashion",
    ", we obtained average `` edge '' and `` center '' spectra for each molecule in each of the cores in our sample .",
    "this analysis was performed on iras053990121 and iras053020537 , since these cores are centrally condensed and have enough spectra to construct meaningful averages . we find that , in iras053990121 , the [ dco@xmath114/[hco@xmath114 ratio increases by only 0.1 in the log between the edge to the center , and the [ hco@xmath114/[co ] ratio increases by less than 0.3 in the log . in iras053020537 , both the [ dco@xmath114/[hco@xmath114 and [ hco@xmath114/[co ] ratios increase by only 0.1 in the log as one goes from the edge to the center . inspection of figure  [ model ] shows that these small changes in the abundance ratios lie well within our observational error bars and have a minimal effect upon the derived electron abundance .",
    "thus , we find no difference in the deuterium fraction or the  abundance between the low visual extinction core edges and the core centers .",
    "the ionization fraction implied by this result depends on the unknown density structure of these cores . for a constant density ( and temperature )",
    "our models will predict similar ionization levels between edge and center of the maps . if these cores have a power - law density profile as found for some low mass cores ( goldsmith & arquilla 1985 ; ward - thompson et al .",
    "1994 ) and suggested by zavagno et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for iras053890756 , then the model predicts a slightly higher level of ionization at the core edges",
    ". however , for both scenarios cosmic ray ionization provides the main source of electrons .    in order to more",
    "carefully investigate the effects of photoionization we can utilize the model of jansen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) who examined the depth dependent chemistry of ic63 , which has a b star located @xmath26 pc away .",
    "this work includes a detailed treatment of the observed uv field of the b star , and its coupling to the photodissociation rates for various molecules . in their model ,",
    "the abundance of  is @xmath118 near the core edges , due to the increased abundance of photo - produced electrons . at larger depths ( @xmath119 4 ) the abundance increases to @xmath120 .",
    "since our results show no evidence for a decline in the  abundance we conclude that we are tracing gas that is shielded from uv radiation and ionized primarily by cosmic rays .",
    "the lack of abundance variation from the edge to the center is similar to recent measurements of abundances across the m17 molecular cloud / ionization front interface where molecular abundances show little variation despite large changes in the radiation field ( bergin et al .",
    "1997b ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to compare the electron abundances between our sample of massive and low mass objects . in order to extend our study towards even more massive cores we use previous studies in the literature .",
    "wootten et al .",
    "( 1982 ) surveyed many sources for emission from dco@xmath121 , , and .",
    "we have used their raw data from ngc1333 and in serpens ( ser mc1 in their notation ) to derive column densities and , with comparison to our models , electron abundances .",
    "we find that @xmath122 in ngc1333 and @xmath123 in serpens .",
    "we can also draw upon the recent work of de boisanger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) who examined electron abundances in denser , very massive sources : w3 irs5 ( @xmath124 ) and ngc2264 ( @xmath125 ) . finally , we compare the observations of bergin et al .",
    "( 1997a ) in the omc-1 core to our chemical models to obtain @xmath126 .",
    "before we compare the electron abundances between our work here and in paper i with those of de boisanger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) it is worthwhile to estimate the total uncertainty in the derived electron fraction . in table  7",
    "we provide an estimate of the minimum and maximum electron abundance that is consistent with the statistical errors in the observed column density ratios .",
    "the average range is @xmath127log@xmath6(@xmath128 , which suggests that the uncertainty is , roughly , a factor of @xmath201.4 .",
    "this range does not include any systematic error that might be introduced by our assumptions with regard to the physical parameters such as the density and temperature .",
    "for the massive cores sampled here , the uncertainty in the determined density , including statistical and systematic effects , is typically a factor of @xmath1293 ( see table 5 ) .",
    "this produces a factor of two uncertainty in the derived ionization fraction .",
    "for the temperature , if we assume that the allowed range is between 15 and 25 k then this is an additional factor of 1.5 .",
    "therefore , with the additional assumption that the cosmic ray ionization rate is the same for each core ( see  5.1 ) , the total uncertainty in the derived electron fraction is a factor of @xmath204 .",
    "the same reasoning applies to the analysis in paper i , while de boisanger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) find that their chemical model predictions are within a factor of two of the observed abundances of 7 ions .",
    "perhaps the most meaningful comparison between electron abundances among the overall sample of cores would compare the level of ionization to the density of each core . however , there is no comprehensive examination of the density using similar models , observations , and methods for the entire range of objects .",
    "the densities of the very massive cores ( e.g. omc-1 ) have been determined via excitation analyses of cs , , and , with values @xmath130  ( e.g. mundy et al .",
    "1985 ; plume et al . 1997 ; bergin , snell , & goldsmith 1997 ) .",
    "the massive cores studied in this work have lower densities , @xmath131 , from our cs analysis .",
    "however , the low mass cores have not been systematically studied using these techniques , although caselli & myers ( 1995 ) show that for a given radius low mass cores have smaller densities by about a factor of three ( i.e. massive cores are larger and denser ) .",
    "since the density is not consistently derived for each source we have opted to use the total  column density along the line of sight .",
    "the  column density is determined using n(c@xmath71o ) , and an assumed fractional abundance of @xmath132 .",
    "column densities for w3 irs5 and ngc2264 are taken from de boisanger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , while for omc-1 we use the column densities in bergin et al .",
    "( 1997a ) .",
    "the electron abundance shown as a function of n ( ) is presented in figure  [ xemvir ] .",
    "examining figure  [ xemvir ] , the abundances for the low mass cores show a large degree of scatter , with a median value of @xmath133 . the massive cores ( along with serpens and ngc1333 ) overlap with the low mass sources , but are more clustered with a lower median electron abundance of 6 @xmath134 . given the estimated uncertainties , which will be reduced by @xmath135 ( n @xmath136 the number of cores ) for the median , and the small number of data points for massive cores , the differences between these two samples are only suggestive .",
    "however , there is a significant difference in the ionization fraction between the very massive ( and densest ) cores ( w3 , omc-1 , and ngc2264 ) and the low mass cores .",
    "these results suggest that the regions with the highest column and volume densities also have lower electron abundances , as would be expected from the conventional picture of cosmic ray ionization .",
    "however , these results must be viewed with caution as there are only 3 data points for very massive sources and the electron abundances for these sources were derived from a different ( although equally valid ) model .",
    "it is noteworthy that there appears to be no difference in the ionization fraction between cores directly associated with star formation and cores without any activity .      in paper",
    "i we examined the question of the ion - neutral coupling in low mass cores in terms of the wave coupling parameter .",
    "the wave coupling parameter , @xmath137 , is defined as the ratio of the core size , @xmath138 , to cutoff wavelength @xmath139 .",
    "the cutoff wavelength is defined by @xmath140 $ ] , where @xmath141 is the alfvn speed , @xmath142 the ion density , and @xmath143 the ion - neutral collision coefficient .",
    "if w @xmath144 the field and gas are coupled over a large range of size scales . for w @xmath145",
    "the ions are decoupled from the field and mhd waves are suppressed ( see paper i for a more comprehensive discussion )",
    ".    the ionization fraction is determined by the balance of cosmic ray ionization and recombination , along with any contribution from metal ions with low ionization potential and longer recombination timescales .",
    "the relation between these values can be expressed as    @xmath146    where @xmath147 is a constant that contains the relative contributions of molecular ions and metals to the ionization balance .",
    "mckee ( 1989 ) derives @xmath148 @xmath149s@xmath150 for an idealized model of cosmic ray ionization . in paper",
    "i we derived a value of @xmath151 @xmath149s@xmath150 . if we use our average electron abundance of @xmath152 and density of 10@xmath153 , we find , for the massive cores in orion , a value of @xmath154 @xmath149s@xmath150 .",
    "considering the error in the electron fraction the difference between the value derived here and for low mass cores is not significant .    for cores which are ionized primarily by cosmic rays and are dominated by non - thermal motions ,",
    "the wave coupling parameter is independent of density and can be expressed as :    @xmath155^{1/2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath156 @xmath157s@xmath25 , and @xmath158 is the mean molecular mass per particle . the equation is listed for the case of maximum turbulence as appropriate for massive cores . both of these conditions , high non - thermal width and cosmic ray ionization , are satisfied for the massive cores in our study and using our best fit value of the ionization rate , @xmath100 s@xmath25 , gives @xmath159 .",
    "thus the field - neutral coupling w of the seven massive cores analyzed here is similar to , or perhaps slightly larger than , that deduced for the 20 low mass cores in paper i ( w = 11 ) . for both samples ,",
    "the coupling is `` marginal , '' i.e. strong enough to allow propagation of mhd waves , but weak enough for some wave damping to occur ( martin , heyvaerts , & priest 1997 , nakano 1998 , myers & lazarian 1998 ) .",
    "this suggests that both low mass and massive cores are more vulnerable to fragmentation and dissipation of their turbulence than are their lower - density , better - coupled environs ( myers 1997 ) .",
    "however , the massive cores considered in this paper appear better able to form stellar groups and clusters than the low mass cores in paper i , for two reasons .",
    "first , the massive cores can be `` clumpier '' than low mass cores , because they have a greater ratio of turbulent to thermal speeds than do the low mass cores ( myers 1998 ) .",
    "second , the typical massive core is a factor of @xmath202 larger than the typical low mass core , so the massive core has more high - density gas and more volume available in which to form stars , than does the typical low mass core",
    ". it will be useful to extend the observations and analysis presented here to more `` very '' massive regions forming ob stars and rich clusters .",
    "we have mapped the emission of three molecular ions ( , , and ) and two neutral species ( cs and ) in massive dense cores . in all we survey 5 cores that are currently associated with star formation and 2 that are starless .",
    "these cores are located in the l1630 and l1641 star forming regions , and are more massive , turbulent , and larger than the sample of low mass cores subject to a similar study in paper i. we have used these observations to derive electron abundances using the same method and chemical model as applied to the low mass cores in paper i. the principal results of this study are :    \\1 ) with use of observations to constrain variables in the chemical calculations , we have constrained the electron fraction in our sample to lie within a small range 6.9",

    "these values are consistent with previous analyses of ionization fractions in other star forming regions . no difference is found between the electron abundances inferred for cores with and without stars .",
    "however , the cores directly associated with stars and molecular outflows have lower levels of deuterium fractionation , which can be attributed to differences in temperature between the various sources .",

    "the observed levels of deuterium fractionation and  abundances do not change with position .",
    "the exact value of ionization fraction implied by the constant ratios depends quite critically on the unknown density / temperature structure of these sources .",
