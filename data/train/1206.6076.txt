    "this effect is referred to as the weyl - anomaly .",

    "the following section consists in inventing a series of massive particle species some of which are `` ghosts '' in the sense of being counted negatively when it comes to the constructions of , say , @xmath9 from their dirac seas  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "`` negatively counted '' species may be a better name since `` ghosts '' is used for something similar but not exactly the same .",
    "that is to say that in our regularization procedure we introduce two series of extra species with different masses .",
    "then the idea is to let some of these extra species count negatively  in the sense that their contributions to energy momentum etc .",
    "( say particle number charge ) are counted negatively while others are counted just as usual fermions .",
    "the basic idea now is to arrange the masses for these extra species so as to cancel out the contributions from the numerically large single particle energies so that the combined system of species together with the original fermion gets cut off .",
    "the typical mass of the extra species come to function as the cut - off scale @xmath111 .    in order to get the main ( quadratic ) divergence field",
    "we need to have including the original fermion just equally many species `` counted negatively '' as counted positively .    in order to get the logarithmic divergence cancel",
    "it is needed to arrange that the coefficient to the term of the form @xmath112 in the large @xmath113 expansion of the energy @xmath114 of the momentum @xmath115 level for the various introduced extra species plus the original fermion cancel out . since the energy @xmath114 of a particle with mass @xmath116 and momentum @xmath117 is large @xmath113 expanded as @xmath118 the condition to be imposed to cut - off the `` logarithmic divergence ''",
    " meaning the coefficient in the total counting ( the `` negative counted '' counted with an extra minus sign ) to @xmath112  is @xmath119    here of course the @xmath120 is  for the `` negative '' and + for the original fermion and extra species being counted positively . in the same notation",
    "the main cut - off being indeed a cut - off condition is @xmath121    with the conditions ( [ c1 ] and [ c2 ] ) the combined system will indeed function as a cut - off . since the proposed cut - off is just based on massive particles ( counted through negatively some of them ) , it will be lorentz invariant and translational invariant and particle number conserving .",
    "however , it will have , nor , nor chiral invariance !",
    "with such a cut - off we should thus be able to preserve lorentz invariance and translational invariance , but risk anomalies in weyl and scale invariance .",
    "that is to say that for a vacuum , which does not break the mentioned symmetries , we should find @xmath122 .    while in the uncut - off theory it looks so conformally invariant that the variation of @xmath79 in the metric @xmath123 is not felt the fermion field , with our cut - off procedure such an influence can come in .",
    "indeed the mass terms in the lagrangian for our extra species become @xmath15-dependent .",
    "indeed we have in the weyl - transformation modified flat space - time metric @xmath124 the massive dirac equation lagrangian @xmath125 so that even after going to the tilded notation @xmath126 we have the mass term @xmath127    by expanding the exponential @xmath128 this term gives rise to `` yukawa''-like couplings of the `` extra species '' to @xmath15 .",
    "if we do not care for the logarithmic divergence but only go for calculating the weyl or conformal anomaly meaning @xmath129 we may not care to fulfill ( [ c1 ] ) and can if we like do with only one extra species , and that one should then be negatively counted .",
    "we shall do so in the following section 4 .",
    "since the weyl or equivalently the conformal is known to mean that the trace of the energy momentum tensor  @xcite @xmath7 turns out to be nonzero , in fact @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the ricci scalar curvature , we need a procedure for extracting this energy momentum tensor @xmath132 .",
    "it is well known [ birrel - davies ] that ( interpreting @xmath13 as renormalized are ( see the footnote 2 lines above ) ) the expression in terms of the fields of a theory including a metric @xmath31 for the energy momentum tensor @xmath133 is obtainable from the action @xmath16 by functional differentiation with respect to the metric @xmath134 or @xmath135 if we rather than the formal expression in terms of the fields such as @xmath136 would like the expectation value in ( say ) the vacuum situation with some background gravitational field  we think of our @xmath137 above  we might extract this expectation value for @xmath138 at a certain space - time point @xmath139 by logarithmically functionally differentiating the vacuum to vacuum s - matrix / transition matrix element @xmath140    here the vacuum in which we are interested should be  of course  the one the dirac sea filed . here",
    "it should be understood that the second quantized hamiltonian @xmath141 should contain the background metric @xmath142 ( unless it `` accidentally '' drops out ) .",
    "this means that the vacuum could develop away from being a vacuum  getting e.g.  pairs produced  due to the effect of the background metric .",
    "however , as we have seen in the action ( [ 2.20 ] ) formally our background field @xmath15 and thus @xmath143 does influence the fermions described in the @xmath144 notation at all . thus unless the cut - off might change the situation",
    ", there is no effect of the considered background metric .",
    "thus if this holds the dirac sea vacuum @xmath145 will remain undistributed by the background metric in the @xmath144 notation .",
    "let us remember though that it is only because we keep to the still metric @xmath146 , that there is no effect of the background metric .",
    "keeping to metric only being of the @xmath146 type we can not extract the @xmath9 proper , because we can not vary the metric arbitrarily , but we extract the @xmath147 , since indeed @xmath148    indeed we have of course with @xmath149 that @xmath150    we might thus extract the trace @xmath7 of the energy momentum tensor @xmath9 alone from varying the background field by some ( extra ) weyl transformation by say @xmath151 i.e.@xmath152 and looking for the variation of the @xmath16-matrix element from vacuum to vacuum .    since we already wrote the formalism above for a by one weyl transformation modified space , it may be most effective to just combine the further for @xmath153-extracting purposes introduced weyl transformation @xmath151 with the already introduced one @xmath15 to one combined @xmath154 weyl transformation @xmath155      since in @xmath156-formulation we have effectively flat space  only with an @xmath157-circle space , @xmath131x@xmath157 space - time  in spite of a non - trivial @xmath79 or say @xmath158 in ( 6.4 ) , we can in reality in @xmath158-independent way expand the second quantized fermion fields @xmath65 and @xmath66 and their hermitean conjugate annihilation and creation operators @xmath159 and correspondingly the daggered second quantized fields would be expanded on a priori creation operators @xmath160    formulated in the complete space - time description using eq .",
    "( [ 2.22 ] ) inserted into the formulas ( [ 4.8]-4.10 ) we obtain the expansion for @xmath51 s .",
    "@xmath161      if we work in the euclidean space - time , we have for the flat case  or if we ignore as we can @xmath158 because it does not couple .    a priori we have a different world each time we change the background field @xmath158 and",
    "thus in principle we should have the creation and annihilation operators @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 depend on @xmath162 so that we should write for example @xmath163}_{n}$ ] , @xmath164}_{n}$ ] , @xmath165}_{n}$ ] and @xmath164}_{n}$ ] .",
    "however , since @xmath166 does appear in the equations of motion of the @xmath66 and @xmath65-fields we may suggestively ignore such @xmath151-dependence and identify them such as @xmath167}_{n}=\\widetilde{b}^{[0]}_{n}\\ ] ] the energy operator @xmath168 while the momentum operator is @xmath169    thus the dispersion relation is depicted in fig.[fig:1 ] .",
    "we have seen above that formally the modification of the metric from @xmath170 to @xmath171 ( see ( [ 2.3 ] ) ) makes no change in the hamiltonian ( see ( [ 2.34 ] ) ) .",
    "really this is seen ( also ) from the equations ( [ 2.34 ] ) , in which @xmath172 has the same expression in @xmath163}_{n}$ ] and @xmath173}_{n}$ ] as @xmath141 in @xmath174}_{n}$ ] and @xmath175}_{n}$ ] .",
    "we can thus stress that in these ( formal ) expressions the modification of the metric has completely dropped out .",
    "so any dependence on the `` weyl transformations '' on the flat space can only come in via the regularization .    in this section 5",
    "we shall now propose a regularization of most importantly the dirac sea .",
    "indeed , a regularization is performed by adding to the system yet a particle species in addition to the fermion described by @xmath176}_{n}$ ] or @xmath177}_{n}$ ] ( which are actually equal to each other ) .",
    "this added particle species should have the quantities to result from its dirac sea be rather than added as for our usual fermion .",
    "so we should declare that energy momentum and particle number from the dirac sea for this added species should be counted with an extra minus sign .",
    "let us immediately give the idea that using our earlier works an `` dirac sea for bosons ''  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite a boson with exactly the same action and equations of motion as the fermions we start from would have this property of subtraction its contribution from collected quantities such as energy momentum and particle number because we found out the dirac sea for bosons should have one particle ( i.e.  added -1 particle ) from each negative energy single particle state .",
    "thus we should imagine that our added species to cancel the contribution from the fermions could be a boson with exactly the same equation and spin etc .  as the fermion .",
    "it would thus not obey the spin statistics theorem in general but rather remind of a ghost - particle species .",
    "now we do not want such a proposed ghost to cancel all the contribution from the fermion dirac sea , but only the beyond the wanted cut - off part .",
    "we propose therefore the `` ghost particle ''  the boson with fermionic equation of motion and `` spin ''  to have a mass @xmath178 of the order of the wanted cut - off @xmath111 , i.e.  @xmath179 .",
    "using such a massive `` ghost '' has the advantage of letting the theory including the cut - off have the usual symmetries such as translational invariance and particle number conservation , but not weyl invariance and not chiral symmetry .",
    "so with this cut - off procedure we can not get anomalies in momentum or particle number conservation , but we `` risk '' to get a weyl anomaly as well as a chiral anomaly .    while the massless fermion is formally untouched by the modification @xmath18 of the metric @xmath180 the ghost - like boson to remove its high energy contribution will `` feel '' this modification via its mass @xmath178 .",
    "indeed the mass term should in principle be understood relative to the physical metric tensor @xmath181 .",
    "we shall be allowed to use totally flat space - time as long as we do not cut - off and use the @xmath66-fields .",
    "however , the mass term which brings the cut - off by being there for the compensating ghost - like species must physically be defined in the @xmath182 -notation .",
    "for instance the mass term @xmath183 for one of our `` negatively counted '' fields in @xmath184-notation would be written in the @xmath185-notation as analogous to ( [ 3.5 ] )    @xmath186    by using for @xmath184 the analogous rewritting to a tilde field @xmath185 to ( [ 2.19 ] ) .",
    "here we used the symbol @xmath187 for the mass in the untilded notation to remind us that this mass is indeed a cut off . in the tilde - notation",
    "we then have an ( effective ) mass @xmath188 which is now space - time dependent .",
    "it is not hard to check that this @xmath79-dependence of the effective mass @xmath189 is consistent with dimensionality considerations .",
    "in fact the distance element @xmath190 is given by @xmath191 so that the physical distance @xmath190 is @xmath192 times the flat distance element @xmath193 given by @xmath194    so a mass @xmath178 given as say @xmath187 in the @xmath190 measuring would in the flat notation based on @xmath193 look like being scaled opposite to the distance  since @xmath178 has dimension of inverse distance  @xmath195    of course such an @xmath196-dependent mass @xmath197 can be interpreted as an interaction of the fermion ( really the boson - ghost ) in a yukawa - type way with the background field @xmath198 by expanding the mass term @xmath199    the @xmath79-dependence only come in via the higher order terms in this expansion firstly of course via @xmath200 and there is no interaction with the original fermion field @xmath201 itself , only with this `` compensating '' ghost - field @xmath185 .",
    "( @xmath202 stands for `` negatively counted . '' )    to truly cancel even logarithmic divergenses we may need both positively and negatively counted massive extra particles such as @xmath184 . in fig 1.5 a suggestive picture of the dispersion relations for the originally occurring particles plus the extra species invented in order to regularize the energy and momentum from the dirac sea .",
    "these dispersion relations are just ordinary relativistic dispersion laws , only the extra `` ghosts '' are massive while the original particle is massless .     of particles in the dirac sea as indicated by the small minussigns  - \" on the negative energy branches of the dispersion relations .",
    "the four different species have their dispersion relations denoted by respectively.,width=453 ]",
    "in order to evaluate the dependence of the functional derivative ( [ 4.1 ] ) on a further weyl transformation @xmath203 leading to the @xmath204 ( [ 4.6 ] ) we need to evaluate @xmath205 at least to second order in @xmath166 . now according to the discussion above",
    " see ( [ 2.20]) the @xmath166 dependence come in only via the cut - off which means then the extra particle which in our simplified case is the negatively counted field .",
    "we shall now calculate the one - loop correction to the second order term in the background @xmath166 field .",
    "it is the idea here to do this by considering the one loop `` vacuum '' diagrams due to the @xmath166 interaction vertices .",
    "@xmath206    the one loop diagrams second order in @xmath166 `` vacuum '' feynman - diagrams are        it is possible to argue that keeping included all the species proposed in our cut - off procedure in section 2 with the conditions ( [ c1 ] ) and ( [ c2 ] ) we can achieve convergence .",
    "in fact we see that for dimensional and lorentz invariance reasons both diagrams give terms proportional to the mass square multiply a logarithmic divergence or a finite dimension as number .",
    "since the logarithmic divergence will not depend on the distance between @xmath207 and @xmath208 we thus with our condition ( [ c1 ] ) we achieved convergence for the sum of these diagrams over the introduced species .",
    "i.e.  the regularizations works .",
    "there of course should come the @xmath209 sign factor from the loop from the furrey - theorem which is missing for the negatively counted species , since they are effectively bosons . as long as we do not look for the dependence on @xmath210 or equivalently the momentum @xmath74 conjugate to @xmath210 our regularization cause cancellation of both the fig.3 a ) and fig.3 b ) diagrams .",
    "since however fig.3 a ) is only nonzero for @xmath211 it means that this diagram offer the summation over our species become totally zero .",
    "so we only have to evaluate the diagram fig.3 b ) .",
    "now we shall remember that + 1)this diagram only gets constructions from the species ( not the original fermion ) .",
    "+ 2)the mass(es ) of the extra species are really the cut - off scale , i.e.  very large .",
    "thus in the @xmath139-representation this diagram   only contributes when there is very short distance between the points @xmath139 and @xmath212 .",
    "thus we should in principle be allowed to taylor expand this diagram in @xmath213 .",
    "if we go to the fourier transformation i.e.  to the momentum representation we should correspondingly be allowed to take the small @xmath214 approximation , only including terms proportional to the first few powers in @xmath214 .",
    "i.e.  we shall assume @xmath215 , as of course is natural since the @xmath116 are of the scale of the cut - off .",
    "the diagram becomes in @xmath139-representation in the simplified form of only one negatively counted species .",

    "of course from translational invariance this @xmath218 only depends on the difference @xmath213 and may fourier transform its dependence on this difference @xmath213 .",
    "@xmath220 where then the fourier transformed @xmath221 of @xmath222 is easily seen to be given by @xmath223    it should be had in mind that because our in the loop encircling particle is a `` negatively counted one '' we at the end do have the furry - theorem s sign corresponding to the loop being a fermion loop but rather we should treat it as a boson loop with respect to furry sign .",
    "i.e.  there should be no furry - sign .",
    "had we included the full set of extra species the logarithmic divergence of the integral would have cancelled out to be 0 .",

    "we write @xmath246 and thus we get @xmath247 \\frac{d\\mu}{4\\pi } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\biggl[\\frac{1}{1\\cdot m^{2}}-\\frac{8m^{2}}{2\\cdot ( m^{2})^{2}}+\\frac{8m^{4}}{3\\cdot ( m^{2})^{3}}\\biggr ] \\cdot \\frac{1}{4\\pi } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{m^{2}}\\bigl(1 - 4+\\frac{8}{3}\\bigr)\\cdot\\frac{1}{4\\pi } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{-1}{4\\pi m^{2}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{3 } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{-1}{12\\pi m^{2}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    so the coefficient in the expansion ( [ 6.6 ] ) to @xmath248 thus is @xmath249    fourier transforming back to @xmath213 representation we have @xmath250 and we shall remember that the ricci curvature scalar is @xmath251    thus a term in @xmath205 of the form + @xmath252 , means that differentiating with respect to @xmath79 so as to extract @xmath253 would give @xmath254 thus we derived @xmath255 this is the well - known weyl anomaly .",
    "we have recomputed the weyl anomaly  the relation of which to the conformal anomaly is described below in the physical picture of being due to the dirac sea , the energy and momentum described by the @xmath13- tensor is simply the ones of the dirac sea particles .",
    "as always you can only obtain an anomaly after having had to regularize .",
    "we have proposed a somewhat new regularization method a bit reminiscent of pauli - villars regularization .",
    "it consists in introducing in addition to the original particles in the theory a little series of similar formal particles .",
    "the crucial feature of some of the introduced formal species of particles is that they are declared to in the dirac sea .",
    "taken it that these formally introduced and negatively counted behave analogous to the original particles except that they get assigned masses of the order of the cut off scale , @xmath256 , we easily see that the contributions to e.g.  energy density or momentum density from the numerically highest energy particles in the ( combined ) dirac sea get cancelled and thus an effective cut off of these numerically high energy contributions . by a little series of formally introduced particles counted some negatively and some",
    "positively it is possible to cancel the divergencies in the dirac sea contribution to e.g.  the @xmath13 -tensor as we discussed it in the present article .",
    "thus one achieves in this way our regularization .",
    "taking into account our earlier article `` dirac sea for bosons '' in which we consider it that there is in second quantizing bosons removed one boson from each negative energy state analogous to diracs adding one for fermions one sees a great similarity of our negatively counted formal regularization - particles and bosons with the wrong spin .",
    "in fact our formally introduced negatively counted particles corresponding to the fermions described @xmath182 above must indeed be essentially bosons just with the wrong `` spin '' or equivalently set of field components inherited from the fermions they shall regularize , because indeed in feynmanloop integrals it would be needed to have from the negatively counted particles analogous loops with just the same large loop four momentum dependence of the integrand so as to cancel the divergence .",
    "such a cancellation could just be achieved due to the furry sign making the boson and fermion loops provided with opposite signs if we simply take the negatively counted specied to be opposite statistics `` for regularization purpose introduced '' particles ; that is to say as bosons if the original particle species is a fermion , or oppositely .    in this sense",
    "our regularization scheme ( proposal ) has some similarity to the role of super - symmetry in removing the ( in)famous quadratic divergence in the higgs mass square thereby presenting a solution to the so called hierarchy problem .",
    "both cancellations are due to bosons cancelling fermions or opposite .",
    "but there is one important difference between the susy cancellation in which fermions and sfermions both obeying spin statistics theorem and our regularization method in which say a fermion contribution is cancelled by a boson that is a `` ghost '' in the sense that it .    according to our `` dirac sea and bosons '' work  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite",
    "such a violation of the spin statistics theorem would mean that our regularized theory has the possibility of negative norm states ( in the fock space ) if you truly treat the to be negatively counted particles regularizing the fermions as bosons .",
    "but that is just as usual : a regularized theory is not satisfactory in all respects .    the weyl symmetry anomaly we recomputed turned out that the energy momentum tensor @xmath253 which would have been expected to be zero in a truly weyl invariant theory turned out to be instead @xmath257    the easy way to see that naively the @xmath19 should be zero if there had been weyl invariance meaning that varying @xmath79 in @xmath258 is think of that the equation @xmath259    implies @xmath260 if @xmath261 does not depend on @xmath79 .",
    "let also remark that the weyl symmetry in which we have recomputed the anomaly is closely related to conformal invariance .",
    "in fact if a theory in 2 dimensions is weyl invariant , it will be conformal invariant even when a background gravity field is included . in a parametrization",
    "in which the metric tensor of the background gravity field of the form @xmath262 a conformal transportation of the matter fields could namely be extended to the background gravity field by varying just the scalar field @xmath263 .",
    "thus if this variation , which just is a weyl transformation @xmath264 is indeed a symmetry of the theory , then the theory will also be conformally invariant even though the space - time is not flat .",
    "then of course if there is an anomaly in the weyl invariance symmetry there will be a corresponding one in the conformal symmetry for the space .",
    "this should also be true in general even for flat space since even in flat space a conformal transformation being extended to the gravitational field would induce a weyl transformation .",
    "however , the special form of the weyl anomaly , being proportional to the curvature scalar @xmath131 will of course turn out to vanish in the flat space .",
    "so because of this feature that the anomaly of be proportional to the curvature ( scalar ) @xmath131 one becomes allowed to say that there is in no conformal anomaly .",
    "we hope that we can find other examples of applying to anomaly calculations :    \\a ) the regularization method with the not spin statistics theorem obeying `` ghost '' particles    \\b ) the dirac sea as a physical picture .    here",
    "we have in mind attempting to recompute the gravitational anomalies  @xcite in chiral fermion theories ( with majorana - weyl in @xmath265 dimensions . )",
    "the authors acknowledge yasuhiro sekino for discussions and comments .",

    "however , the quantum corrections to the effective action obtain divergent terms , that can even involve second order gravity lagrangian contributions , which thus have to be remormalized .",
    "this means that the separation between gravitational and matter energy momentum tensor becomes ambiguous .",
    "we could claim that equation ( [ 4.1 ] ) is understood to be interpreted to be true only after the gravitational effective lagrangian terms induced from the matter fields have been renormalized away . strictly speaking this interpretation of ( [ 4.1 ] ) as being valid for the `` renormalized @xmath266 '' means that we take ( [ 4.1 ] ) as a definition of @xmath13 ( for the matter ) , a definition that is needed because of the just mentioned ambiguity in the concept of `` matter '' .",
