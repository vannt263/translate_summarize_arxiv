    "in the 17 years since the detection of the first known transiting exoplanet hd209458 @xcite , transit surveys have come of age and refined our understanding of exoplanetary system architectures .",
    "we now know of several thousand transiting planets . while the _ kepler _ space mission @xcite was responsible for most of these discoveries , the majority of the @xmath10 with masses @xmath11 were discovered by ground - based surveys that are optimized to find giant planets in short - period orbits , now called hot jupiters .",
    "one such survey is the kilodegree extremely little telescope ( kelt ) project @xcite which has been carrying out synoptic observations of the sky for more than a decade . owned and operated by ohio state , vanderbilt , and lehigh universities ,",
    "kelt features two 42 mm diameter telescopes , one in arizona ( kelt - north ) and one in south africa ( kelt - south ) .",
    "each has a @xmath12 field of view and a pixel scale of @xmath13 , and together they survey @xmath14 of the sky with a cadence of 10 - 20 min and photometric precision of @xmath15 .",
    "kelt aims to detect transits of stars in the magnitude range @xmath16 , filling a niche between the brighter stars generally targeted by radial - velocity surveys and fainter stars measured by other transit surveys .",
    "this is also the range that will be covered in the forthcoming transiting exoplanet survey satellite tess @xcite , for which kelt and other surveys are laying the groundwork .",
    "even though the number of known transiting hot jupiters has grown , some regions of their parameter space are still sparsely sampled . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the kelt survey includes a higher percentage of hot , luminous stars than do transit surveys targeting fainter stars .",
    "coupled with the fact that surveys like kelt are biased towards finding planets on the large end of the underlying radius distribution @xcite this means that kelt is efficient in detecting strongly irradiated and inflated giant planets .",
    "their bright hosts make them excellent candidates for follow - up observations and detailed characterization with a range of techniques , and their extremes in host temperature and planet radius make them useful for constraining models of hot jupiter formation and evolution .    in this paper , we present the discovery of kelt-18b , an inflated hot jupiter orbiting a hot @xmath0 mag f4 star .",
    "kelt-18b joins a still - small collection of very low density , highly inflated planets transiting hot hosts .",
    "we describe kelt and follow - up photometry , spectroscopy , and adaptive optics imaging observations (  [ sec : obs ] ) , and we use them to characterize stellar and planetary parameters (  [ sec : star],[sec : planet ] ) .",
    "we also report the detection of a faint neighboring star and consider whether it is a bound companion (  [ sec : neighbor ] ) .",
    "finally , we situate kelt-18b in the landscape of hot jupiters and discuss its potential to provide constraints on models of hot jupiter formation and evolution (  [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "the star bd+60 1538 = tyc 3865 - 1173 - 1 = kelt-18 was identified as a candidate host star of a transiting planet in kelt - north field 21 , a @xmath12 region centered on @xmath17 .",
    "the discovery light curve , shown in figure [ fig : discoverylc ] , was based on 4162 observations obtained between 2012 feb and 2014 dec .",
    "a box - least - squares @xcite analysis yielded a preliminary period of @xmath18 , duration of @xmath19 , and depth of @xmath20 . a detailed description of kelt image analysis procedures is given in @xcite .",

    ". these observations also help to identify false positives such as blends and nearby eclipsing binaries that lie inside the large apertures used with the kelt telescopes @xmath13 pixels .",
    "kelt - fun observers plan photometric follow - up observations with the help of custom software tools including a web - based transit prediction calculator based on the tapir package @xcite .",
    "observers reduce their own data and generate preliminary light curves that are submitted to the kelt science team . when an exoplanet is confirmed , the individual follow - up images are collected by the science team and final aperture photometry is carried out using the astroimagej package ( aij ; @xcite ) .",
    "all times are converted to barycentric julian dates at mid - exposure , bjd@xmath8@xcite .",
    "the kelt - fun photometric observations for kelt-18 are summarized in table [ tab : photom ] .",
    "we obtained five full transits and 11 partials between ut 2016 apr 15 and 2016 jul 21 at 10 different observatories : acton sky portal ( asp ) , ankara university krieken observatory ( aukr ) , canela s robotic observatory ( crow ) , grinnell college grant o. gale observatory ( grinnell ) , kutztown university observatory ( kuo ) , the university of louisville moore observatory ritchey - chrtien ( morc ) telescope , swarthmore college peter van de kamp observatory ( pvdk ) , westminster college observatory ( wco ) , wellesley college whitin observatory ( whitin ) , and roberto zambelli s observatory ( zro ) .",
    "several of the partials suffer from systematics that precluded their use in the global fits (  [ sec : globalfit ] ) , as detrending parameters are not always well - constrained if there is not both a pre - ingress and post - egress baseline .",
    "the individual light curves used are shown in figure [ fig : all_lightcurve ] .",
    "the lower panel shows these curves combined and binned in 5-minute intervals , as well as the residuals from the model .",
    "this combined and binned light curve is not used for analysis , but rather to illustrate the overall signal - to - noise ( s / n ) that results from the full set of follow - up photometry .    when producing the preliminary individual light curves in aij , we fit a transit model to each data set with limb - darkening parameters chosen appropriately for the stellar type .",
    "we use the bayesian information criterion to select the best complement of comparison stars for each dataset , as well as to determine which observed parameters may be systematically affecting the differential photometry .",
    "these  detrending parameters , \" shown in table [ tab : photom ] , are then included as free parameters when incorporating the kelt - fun photometric data sets in the global fits ( see  [ sec : globalfit ] below ) .",
    "airmass is always included as a detrending parameter , as even differential photometry may suffer airmass - dependent effects particularly when the comparison stars have different colors from the target .",
    "other parameters considered include the position of the target on the ccd (  x \" and  y \" ) , which may induce trends due to residual flatfielding and illumination patterns ; the aij estimate of the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the stellar images (  fwhm \" ) ; the summed counts in the ensemble of comparison stars (  total counts \" ) ; the sky brightness near the target (  sky / pixel \" ) ; and a constant offset that can be applied to discontinuous data ( denoted  meridian flip \" as it often results from position shifts that occur when a meridian crossing requires a telescope flip on some equatorial mounts ) .",
    "we also include in table [ tab : photom ] the sizes of the apertures used for photometry .",
    "kelt - fun photometric aperture sizes vary from data set to data set because of the differences in plate scale and seeing conditions at this diverse collection of observatories , plus the fact that some observers intentionally defocus to minimize the effects of flatfielding errors .",
    "optimal photometric apertures are determined individually for each data set .",
    "we include them here to allow an assessment of possible contamination from any neighboring objects .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      we know that the rv signals are not coming from the faint neighbor because the spectroscopic apertures exclude it .",
    "several lines of evidence help us to rule out other false - positive scenarios for kelt-18b .",
    "first , our follow - up light curves cover the @xmath58 and @xmath59 passbands , and are all consistent with the global model as shown in figure 2 . while this evidence is not conclusive on its own , blends often produce detectable light curve depth chromaticity across the optical bands .",
    "second , examination of a high - resolution spectrum reveals no absorption lines from a second star .",
    "third , we use the procedures outlined in @xcite ( tres ) and @xcite ( apf ) to examine the rv bisector spans and check whether the rv variations might instead be caused by spectral line asymmetries due to a nearby eclipsing binary star or stellar activity in kelt-18 itself .",
    "the bisector values are reported in table [ tab : spectra ] and shown in figure [ fig : bisectors ] .",
    "we find a spearman rank correlation coefficient of @xmath60 with probability @xmath61 , giving no indication that the periodic rv signal is due to any astrophysical phenomena other than the orbital motion .",
    "finally , the ao images rule out any blended source up to 8 mag fainter than kelt-18 at a projected separation of @xmath62 ( see figure [ fig : aocontrast ] ) .",
    "none of our radial - velocity observations were obtained during a transit , so we do not have additional information from a doppler tomographic signal that would add constraints to any blend scenario .",
    "in a series of recent papers , the friends of hot jupiters collaboration ( fohj ; @xcite and references therein ) has been examining the frequency , properties , and implications of stellar companions to hot jupiter hosts .",
    "they find that hot jupiters are commonly found in multiple - star systems with separations in the range 50 - 2000 au with a frequency higher than expected based on the statistics for field stars . at our derived distance of 311pc (  [",
    "sec : sed ] ) , the projected separation of @xmath63 (  [ sec : ao ] ) between kelt-18 and its on - sky neighbor corresponds to a projected physical separation of @xmath64 , right in this range .",
    "thus if the two stars are bound , kelt-18 fits the pattern and adds to the collection of  friends . \" in this section we argue that the neighbor is plausibly a bound companion .      if the neighbor is a physical companion , we can assume it has the same distance and reddening as kelt-18 and compare its absolute @xmath65 magnitude to the predictions of the @xcite stellar evolutionary models for low - mass stars .",
    "we take the neighbor s apparent magnitude @xmath66 (  [ sec : ao ] ) and distance @xmath67 pc (  [ sec : sed ] ) to get an absolute magnitude @xmath68 ( the extinction in @xmath65 is negligible ) . for the estimated age of @xmath69 gyr (  [ sec : evol ] ) , the models predict @xmath70 which is consistent with our estimate of @xmath71 determined from @xmath72 and @xmath73band magnitudes in  [ sec : sed ] .",
    "this implies that the neighbor is plausibly at the same distance as kelt-18 .      to investigate this further , we compute the probability that a star of similar or brighter magnitude to the neighbor would be found within @xmath74 of any random point of sky in this region .",
    "we used ds9 to download a 2mass k - band image surrounding kelt-18 and via its catalog tool determined that in a @xmath75 box there are 186 ( or 268 ) objects per square degree with k@xmath7612.9 ( or 13.5 , which is the 3 sigma faint limit ) .",
    "this is a relatively small on - sky density because kelt-18 is at high galactic latitude ( @xmath77 ) . even for the fainter magnitude ,",
    "the probability of a chance alignment within any @xmath78 circle in this area is only @xmath79 for a probability of 0.08% .",
    "we conclude that with @xmath80 confidence the neighbor is likely a physical companion to kelt-18 .",
    "if the neighbor is a bound companion as we suspect , the projected angular separation implies a minimum circular orbital period of @xmath81 years , too long to detect .",
    "thus , it should effectively travel across the sky with the same proper motion as kelt-18 and the separation should remain constant . to check for this",
    ", we attempted to measure multi - epoch astrometry .",
    "one epoch was provided by our own ao image .",
    "we also used the sdss _",
    "z_-band image ( observed 2001 may ) , where the neighbor is best - resolved , to measure the separation . using three different metrics to determine the center of the saturated kelt-18",
    ", we find an average separation of @xmath82 where the uncertainty represents the scatter from the three methods .",
    "the separation and position angle are both in agreement with those determined from the ao measurement .",
    "kelt-18 s proper motion of @xmath83 ( derived from values in table [ tab : litprops ] ) would translate to a relative shift of @xmath84 over the 15 yr baseline _ if _ the neighbor had zero proper motion .",
    "given the uncertainty in the sdss measurement we could expect at best a @xmath85 detection of a shift , so the fact that we see none is not yet significant .",
    "the much better @xmath86 precision of the ao observations does however suggest that , unless the neighbor has proper motion similar to kelt-18 s , a second ao observation with tolerance 001 could detect relative motion in just a few years .",
    "kelt-18b is a highly inflated hot jupiter in a @xmath87 au circular orbit transiting a 2 gyr old f4v host star . among the known planet hosts",
    ", kelt-18 joins a small group that are as hot ( @xmath88k ) , as massive ( @xmath89 ) , and as bright ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "the other hosts in this group are : hat - p-49 , hat - p-57 , kelt-7 , kelt-17 , wasp-33 , and the extremely massive kepler-13b ( @xmath91 ; @xcite ) . of these",
    ", kelt-18 hosts the planet with the lowest mass ( @xmath92 ) but also the largest radius ( @xmath93 ) , i.e. kelt-18b has the lowest density ( @xmath94 ) among the planets with hot , bright hosts . comparing kelt-18b with those planets will help to inform our overall understanding of planet formation around massive stars .",
    "kelt-18 s low density is not surprising given that its proximity to its hot host subjects it to a very high level of incident flux , or insolation .",
    "as shown in table [ tab : kelt-18b_global_fit_properties ] , the current level is @xmath95 , which is @xmath96 higher than the threshold for radius inflation @xcite .",

    "@xcite have derived an empirical relation for a planet s radius as a function of flux @xmath98 . for large planets , defined as @xmath99 , they find that the insolation is a bigger factor than the mass in determining the radius , and that @xmath100 with an rms scatter of @xmath101 . however , there are only a few planets in the compilation with insolation as high as kelt-18b s , so its addition to the collection adds a useful check . for kelt-18b ,",
    "the relation predicts a radius of @xmath102 , which is consistent with our inferred radius of @xmath93 .",
    "kelt-18b is also consistent with the recent results of @xcite , who analyzed hot jupiter masses and radii together with the evolutionary states of their hosts .",
    "they interpret a relationship between the planetary radius and the stellar fractional age to indicate that hot jupiters are reinflated as their hosts age through their main sequence lifetimes . according to their formalism",
    ", we find that kelt-18 s fractional age ( 0.6 ) and kelt-18b s radius put this system right in the middle of their distribution .",
    "kelt-18b presents an excellent opportunity for observations aimed at atmospheric characterization . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vmags ] , it has a host that is one of the hottest among the brightest hosts of transiting hot jupiters , much like its southern cousin kelt-14b .",
    "@xcite describe how kelt-14b s very high equilibrium temperature ( 1904 k ) and bright host star @xmath103-band magnitude ( @xmath103 = 9.424 ) , make it a prime target for direct detection of thermal emission from the daytime side of the planet through infrared photometric measurements made near secondary eclipse .",
    "kelt-18b provides an even stronger opportunity : the host is even brighter ( k = 9.21 ) and the planet hotter ( 2100 k ) .",
    "kelt-18b is also an excellent candidate for atmospheric transmission spectroscopy ; it is much like the collection of planets recently observed with the hubble space telescope by @xcite . because the atmospheric scale height @xmath36 varies inversely with the surface gravity ,",
    "kelt-18b s low @xmath104  means that features could be relatively strong . to estimate @xmath36 we adopt the equilibrium surface temperature @xmath105 k and surface gravity @xmath106 @xmath107   from table [ tab : kelt-18b_global_fit_properties ] and assume a fiducial mean molecular weight of @xmath108 to get @xmath109 km . for kelt-18b that corresponds to a fractional difference in transit depth with wavelength of up to @xmath110 .",
    "kelt-18b could also help to constrain cloud and haze formation scenarios at high temperatures .",
    "an added bonus is that its very hot host means there would be fewer complications from stellar absorption features compared to many of the other bright hosts with later spectral types .",
    "we strongly encourage transmission spectroscopic observations .     and @xmath30-band magnitude for known transiting exoplanets .",

    "kelt-18 s effective temperature places it well above the kraft break @xcite , and in the regime where stars are generally rapidly rotating .",
    "the underlying distribution of rotational speeds for main sequence stars as hot as @xmath111 6670 k is not well - enough constrained observationally to permit a precise calculation of the inclination based on the observed @xmath112 .",
    "however the recent models of @xcite indicate that for stars with kelt-18 s temperature and surface gravity , the rotational velocities are typically in excess of 100 @xmath45 .",
    "the observed slow @xmath113 thus makes it possible that we are seeing the star close to pole on .",
    "we are led to a similar conclusion from the recent compilation of rotational periods for 24,000 kepler stars by @xcite , which indicates that for stars in kelt-18 s effective temperature range , the distribution of rotational periods is strongly peaked at @xmath114 days .",
    "kelt-18 s rotational period assuming an",
    "edge - on view of the rotation would be @xmath115 days , out on the very low - amplitude tail of the distribution .",
    "we conclude that the evidence is suggestive , but not conclusive , that kelt-18 is seen close to pole - on .    in some cases ,",
    "it is possible to get an independent measurement of the star s rotational speed by carrying out an analysis of time - series photometry to search for periodic signatures such as those that could result from starspot modulation .",
    "kelt-18 is hot enough that these signatures may be weak , but we can check for them using the kelt photometry by generating a lomb - scargle @xcite periodogram . to do",

    "red boxes show the same data binned to illustrate the variation more clearly . ]",
    "our evidence is suggestive but not yet conclusive that kelt-18 is seen nearly pole - on .",
    "however , if this is the case , then its spin and the orbit of its transiting planet would necessarily be misaligned .",
    "@xcite have found that misaligned systems tend to occur for hosts more massive than 1.2@xmath120 .",
    "a misaligned kelt-18 would add to this collection , with a host more massive than any in that study .",
    "it would also fit into the framework proposed by @xcite and further developed by @xcite based on rossiter - mclaughlin determinations of projected spin - orbit angles , or obliquities : hot jupiters are formed with a range of obliquities , which are damped by tides only for the case of hosts with relatively large convective stellar envelopes .",
    "this can include both zero age main sequence @xmath121 stars and hotter stars once they are old enough to be evolving off the main sequence .",
    "kelt-18 s temperature , mass ratio , and orbit size are in the ranges for which high projected obliquities are found .",
    "future spectroscopic observations during transit should allow an independent check on the alignment for the kelt-18 system , adding a useful high , @xmath122 data point .",
    "one possibility is that kelt-18 s high inferred obliquity is related to the presence of its suspected companion (  [ sec : neighbor ] ) , for example via kozai - lidov migration ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the fohj collaboration @xcite and references therein concluded that for hot jupiters detected by ground - based surveys like kelt , kozai - lidov oscillations can not be the dominant migration mechanism .",
    "nonetheless we can explore the possibility for kelt-18 .",
    "we compute and set equal the kozai and general relativistic precessional periods ( using the @xcite equations 1 and 23 with eccenticity 0.5 for the stellar orbits following @xcite ) to find that if kelt-18 s neighbor is bound , and its projected separation is the true separation , then the kozai mechanism could be effective for a formation distance of @xmath123 .",
    "thus it is at least plausible as a contributor to the orbital evolution .",
    "if kelt-18 is _ not _ in fact seen at high inclination but is instead a naturally slow rotator , the measured @xmath124 implies a rotation period of @xmath125 . in this case , we can model the insolation history and future of kelt-18b using the techniques of @xcite and following the approach described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "briefly , we assume that the host star rotates as a solid body with period longer than the planet s orbit , and that tidal torques ( with constant phase lag ) exerted by the planet are the only physical influence on the stellar rotation .",
    "we take as boundary conditions the current stellar parameters and orbital semi - major axis from table [ tab : kelt-18b_global_fit_properties ] and adopt the appropriate yy stellar evolutionary track to account for the star s changing radius and luminosity with age .",
    "we consider a range of stellar tidal quality factors @xmath126 where @xmath127 is a product of the love number and the tidal phase lag .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : orbitalevol ] .",
    "assuming that the evolution has been driven by tides alone , we see that kelt-18b s insolation has been well above the radius inflation threshold for the whole main sequence life of its host independent of @xmath126 .",
    "though other mechanisms ( e.g. disk migration , scattering ) would have had to bring kelt-18 close to the star initially , we see that for small @xmath128 , the inward migration due to tides alone could have begun with the planet as much as 60% farther away than it currently orbits ( about 5 stellar radii ) and could end as soon as 40 myr from now as the planet converges on the star . however , we reiterate that this model is only valid if the star is rotating sub - synchronously , which we believe is unlikely to be the case .     and assuming that the star s spin period is longer than the orbital period ( which may not be the case ;  [ sec : spinorbit ] ) .",
