    "modern realistic nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) potentials using a sufficiently large number of parameters describe current nn phase shifts very well .",
    "the most prominent ones are cd - bonn@xcite , nijmegen 93 , i , ii @xcite , and argonne av18  @xcite .",
    "they predict nn observables up to about 350 mev nucleon laboratory energy perfectly well with a @xmath2 .",
    "this potential description is linked to a nonrelativistic schrdinger equation . converged , nonrelativistic three - nucleon bound state calculations based upon these potentials give values for the triton binding energy between 8.0 and 7.6  mev @xcite , whereas the experimental result is 8.48  mev . there is some sensitivity to nonlocalities in the nn interactions , which influences the value of the triton binding energy .",
    "while the nijmegen 93 and i and the av18 potential are local , nijmegen ii and cd - bonn incorporate nonlocalities either via a @xmath3 dependence or the nonlocality structure given by dirac spinors and so - called ` minimal relativity ' factors .",
    "it is well established by now that the purely local interactions in the above list lead to a triton binding energy of about 7.7  mev , leaving about 0.8  mev unexplained .",
    "in general , the missing binding energy is attributed to some combination of nonlocality in the nn interactions , three - nucleon force effects and relativistic effects .",
    "of course , these effects are often intermingled , i.e. relativity can motivate specific nonlocalities , and negative energy components of a nucleon wave function could be viewed as a specific subset of three - nucleon forces @xcite .",
    "the estimation of relativistic effects on the binding of three nucleons has been the focus of a lot of work .",
    "however , up to now there has not been reached closure even on the sign of    a relativistic contribution to the three - nucleon binding energy .",
    "there are essentially two different approaches to a relativistic three - nucleon bound state calculation , one is a manifestly covariant scheme linked to a field theoretical approach , the other one is based on relativistic quantum mechanics on space - like hypersurfaces ( including the light front ) in minkowski space . within the first scheme rupp and tjon @xcite find attractive corrections to the triton binding energy , using separable interactions to facilitate the solution of the bethe - salpeter - faddeev equations .",
    "a three - dimensional reduction of this equation also finds attractive contributions @xcite . the calculations of stadler _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite are based on a relativistic three - nucleon equation , incorporate the effects of dirac spinors and include negative energy components .",
    "they also incorporate off - shell effects of the negative energy components of the dirac spinors , and by varying this part , which is not constraint by on - shell nn data , they can achieve an attractive contribution to fit the experimental value . within the second scheme the relativistic hamiltonian consists of relativistic kinetic energies , two- and many - body interactions including their boost corrections .",
    "the boost corrections are dictated by the poincar algebra @xcite .",
    "there exist already applications for the three - nucleon bound state @xcite , which suggest a repulsive contribution to the three - nucleon binding .",
    "thus , the relativistic effects found in the two schemes appear controversial , in the approach based on field theory , relativistic effects increase the triton binding energy , in the approach based on relativistic hamiltonians , relativistic effects decrease the triton binding energy .    to the best of our knowledge",
    "we are not aware of any three - nucleon ( 3n ) scattering calculation including relativity in one or the other scheme due to the increased difficulty of a scattering calculation . in order to extend the hamiltonian scheme in equal time formulation to 3n scattering",
    "it would be a very convenient starting point to have the lorentz boosted nn potential which generates the nn @xmath0-matrix in a moving frame via a standard lippmann - schwinger equation . in this paper we work out the nn potential in an arbitrary frame , and thus place our work in the scheme based on relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "as application of our lorentz - boosted potential we restrict ourselves to the calculation of the triton binding energy .    the starting point for an nn potential in an arbitrary moving frame",
    "is the interaction in the two - nucleon c.m .",
    "system , which enters a relativistic nn schrdinger or lippmann - schwinger equation . while realistic nn potentials are defined and fitted in the context of the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation",
    ", nn potentials refitted with the same accuracy in the framework of the relativistic nn schrdinger equation do not yet exist .",
    "a first step in that direction has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the av18 potential has been refitted to describe nn phase shifts in the relativistic context .",
    "here we prefer to use a different route and employ an analytical scale transformation of momenta which relates nn potentials in the nonrelativistic and relativistic schrdinger equations such that exactly the same nn phase shifts are obtained by both equations @xcite .",
    "though this transformation is not a substitute for a nn potential with proper relativistic features and though it suffers from some conceptual defects  @xcite , it can serve the purpose of this work , namely to illustrate the effects of a lorentz boosts on nn potentials .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we derive and explicitly formulate the lorentz - boosted potential related to a given nonrelativistic potential . in section iii we apply our formulation to the reid soft core potential and discuss features of the lorentz boost",
    ". then we solve the relativistic 3n faddeev equation based on that lorentz - boosted potential .",
    "we end with a brief summary and outlook in section iv .",
    "a formalism for treating the relativistic three - body faddeev equations has been introduced in @xcite .",
    "there a lorentz boosted t - matrix is constructed from the relativistic two - nucleon @xmath0-matrix given in the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) center - of - mass ( c.m . ) system .",

    "( [ vrel ] ) is general and independent of the way , the relativistic potential was obtained .    in order to study the effect of the boost on the potential in more detail , we choose as the nonrelativistic potential the reid soft core potential ( rsc ) @xcite .",

    "it is interesting to notice , that in the case of the yamaguchi potentials , which are purely attractive , the relativistic , repulsive effect is weaker , namely only about 0.2  mev .",
    "this is presumably connected to the absence of short range repulsive force components , i.e. high momentum components , which are presumably mostly affected by the relativistic effects .",

    "<S> a lorentz boosted two - nucleon potential is introduced in the context of equal time relativistic quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical input for the boosted nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) potential is based on realistic nn potentials , which by a suitable scaling of the momenta are transformed into nn potentials belonging to a relativistic two - nucleon schrdinger equation in the c.m . </S>",
    "<S> system . </S>",
    "<S> this resulting lorentz boosted potential is consistent with a previously introduced boosted two - body @xmath0-matrix . </S>",
    "<S> it is applied in relativistic faddeev equations for the three - nucleon bound state to calculate the @xmath1h binding energy . </S>",
    "<S> like in previous calculations the boost effects for the two - body subsystems are repulsive and lower the binding energy . </S>"
