    "raman scattering is an effective tool to study the excitation spectrum of magnetic systems since the intensity of the inelastically scattered light is directly related to the density of singlet states at zero momentum . in local - moment magnets with well defined magnon excitations",
    "this quantity is linked to the two - magnon density of states .",
    "therefore , magnetic raman scattering plays an important role in understanding the dynamics and interactions of magnons in conventional spin systems @xcite .",
    "this is particularly true for the spin-@xmath3 square - lattice heisenberg antiferromagnet ( haf ) of the high - t@xmath4 superconductor parent compounds , where experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies of the magnetic correlations by raman scattering may provide important insight into the energy scales relevant to the pairing mechanism ( for reviews see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    raman scattering from hafs can be understood in terms of the loudon - fleury ( lf ) processes @xcite , in which two magnons are simultaneously created by light absorption and emission . in the limit of large on - site coulomb correlations @xmath5",
    ", the hamiltonian describing these processes can be obtained as a leading term of the expansion in @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) hopping , and @xmath8 is of the order of photon frequencies @xcite .    the raman intensity of hafs on hypercubic lattices with unfrustrated nn exchange and collinear type of antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order allows for a straightforward semi - quantitative interpretation in terms of the lf processes .",
    "in fact , in real space , exchanging two nn spins of @xmath0 leads to an excitation with energy @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the coordination number and @xmath11 is the afm exchange energy .",
    "the reduction of @xmath12 by @xmath13 is a consequence of the exchange link between the nn sites and can be interpreted in terms of a two - magnon interactions in the final state . in momentum space ,",
    "the linear spin - wave theory yields non - dispersive magnons along the the magnetic brillouin zone ( bz ) boundary , leading to a square - root divergence of the bare two - magnon density of states at @xmath14 .",
    "inclusion of the final state magnon - magnon interactions broadens the singularity and shifts it down to @xmath15 @xcite in two dimensions , which is consistent , both with the real - space result @xmath16 , and with the experimentally observed raman profile .",
    "in contrast to conventional collinear hafs , very little is known theoretically about raman scattering from frustrated hafs .",
    "this is intriguing , since the singlet spectrum is believed to be an essential fingerprint of such magnets .",
    "the spin @xmath0 haf on the triangular lattice ( thaf ) with nn exchange interactions is a prominent example of strongly frustrated spin systems .",
    "it has a ground state with non - collinear @xmath17 degree ordering of the spins . due to this non - collinearity of the classical ground state , nontrivial corrections to the spin - wave spectrum",
    "appear already to first order in @xmath1 .",
    "it has been shown in refs.@xcite that @xmath1 corrections strongly modify the form of the magnon dispersion of the triangular haf .",
    "the resulting dispersion turns out to be almost flat in a wide range of momenta in which it possesses shallow local minima , `` rotons '' , at the midpoint of the faces of the hexagonal bz .",
    "this differs strongly from the classical spin - wave spectrum , which lacks such minima and flat zones .",
    "similar results have been obtained in series expansion studies @xcite .    motivated by these recent findings , in this paper",
    ", we analyze the raman scattering from the thaf by @xmath1 expansion .",
    "this is complementary to the recent analysis of raman scattering on finite , 16 sites thafs by means of exact diagonalization @xcite .",
    "first , our results show that the raman intensity is very sensitive to both @xmath1 corrections of the magnon spectrum and the magnon - magnon interactions in the final state .",
    "moreover , we find that the loudon - fleury process on the thaf leads to a raman profile , which is independent at @xmath2 of the scattering geometry .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] , we review results from existing calculations @xcite of the one magnon excitations in the thaf to first order in @xmath1 needed for our study of the raman spectra . in section [ sec3 ] we consider the lfp to leading order in @xmath1 . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we calculate the raman spectrum on various levels of approximation in @xmath1 , i.e. bare , one - magnon renormalized , and including final state interactions , and show that raman profile is very sensitive to the magnon - magnon interactions .",
    "we discuss our results in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "the hamiltonian of the thaf reads @xmath18 where @xmath19 are spin@xmath20 operators , @xmath21 refers to sites on the triangular lattice , @xmath22 denotes nn summation , and @xmath11 is the exchange interaction .",
    "the classical ground state of the thaf @xcite is a non - collinear @xmath17 degree ordering of spins which is shown in fig.[geometry]a ) . to avoid the complexity of a three - sublattice notation",
    "it is convenient to work within a locally rotated frame of reference in which the magnetic order is ferromagnetic . to achieve this",

    "second , as the bz - boundary saddle - point of @xmath47 has turned into a flat region , occupying substantial parts of the bz for @xmath57 , the intensity of the lower energy peak is strongly enhanced due to the very large density of one - magnon states .",
    "equally important , the imaginary part of @xmath57 is finite in the bz - region which corresponds to the maximal one - magnon energies .",

    "discarding momentum dependencies and iterating the two - magnon bubble times the irreducible vertex @xmath93 , leads to a renormalization of the intensity by a factor , roughly of the form @xmath146 , where @xmath147 refers to the two - magnon bubble . directly at the peak position of the raman bubble",
    "this renormalization factor may get small , thereby suppressing the over - all intensity . while exactly the same mechanism is at work also for the square lattice haf , its impact on the spectrum is complete different . in the latter case",
    "the peak - intensity without final state interactions is at the upper cut - off of the raman intensity .",
    "suppression of this peak - intensity simply shifts the maximum intensity to lower frequencies within the raman spectrum .",

    "such reasoning can not be pursued in the present case .",
    "to summarize , we have investigated magnetic raman scattering from the two - dimensional triangular heisenberg antiferromagnet considering various levels of approximation within a controlled @xmath1-expansion .",
    "our study has revealed several key differences as compared to the well - known magnetic raman scattering from the planar square lattice spin-@xmath3 antiferromagnet .",
    "first , we found that the intensity profile is insensitive to the in - plane scattering geometry of the incoming and outgoing light at @xmath2 .",
    "this has to be contrasted against the clear difference between a@xmath148 and b@xmath149 symmetry for the square - lattice case .",
    "second , on the level of linear spin - wave theory , we showed that the raman intensity has two van - hove singularities .",
    "the less intensive peak is located at the upper edge of the two - magnon density of states and stems from twice the maximum of the one - magnon energy .",
    "this is similar to the square lattice case .",
    "however , the dominant peak is located approximately in the center of the two - magnon density of states .",
    "this peak stems from the loudon - fleury raman - vertex strongly selecting the brillouin zone boundary regions where the one - magnon dispersion on the triangular lattice has an additional weak van - hove singularity .",
    "this is absent on the square lattice .",
    "next , we calculated the raman intensity with the one - magnon spectrum , renormalized to @xmath2 , however neglecting final - state interactions within the raman process .",
    "in this case we have obtained a sharp and almost @xmath150-functional raman peak at energy @xmath151 . at this energy",
    "the real part of the renormalized one - magnon dispersion shows a large plateau - region at the brillouin zone boundary with a roton - like shallow minimum .",
    "moreover , due to phase - space constraints the one - magnon life - time is large in this region .",
    "therefore , the two - magnon density of states in this region is strongly enhanced , as compared to the linear spin - wave result .",
    "in contrast to that , the intensity at the upper edge of the spectrum is suppressed further , since the @xmath2 corrections lead to the significant one - magnon damping .",
    "finally the overall width of the spectrum is reduced by a factor of approximately @xmath152 .    in a last step , we considered the impact of the final - state interactions to @xmath2 . due to the non - collinear ordering on the triangular lattice , and in sharp contrast to the square - lattice case , we find , that even to lowest order the two - magnon scattering is neither instantaneous in time , nor separable in momentum space .",
    "our solution of the corresponding bethe - salpeter equation reveals a broad continuum - like raman profile which results from a smearing of the intensity of the two - roton peak by virtue of repeated two - magnon scattering . while , at this order in @xmath1 the over - all form of the raman profile is reminiscent of that on the square - lattice , one has to keep in mind , that in the latter case the position of the maximum in the center of the raman continuum has to interpreted rather differently , namely in terms of a two - magnon binding effect .",
    "in conclusion we hope that our theoretical investigation will stimulate further experimental analysis of triangular , and more generally frustrated magnetic systems by raman scattering .",

    "<S> we investigate two - magnon raman scattering from the @xmath0 heisenberg antiferromagnet on the triangular lattice , considering both the effect of renormalization of the one - magnon spectrum by @xmath1 corrections and final - state magnon - magnon interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the bare raman intensity displays two peaks related to one - magnon van - hove singularities . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath1 self - energy corrections to the one - magnon spectrum strongly modify this intensity profile . </S>",
    "<S> the central raman - peak is significantly enhanced due to plateaus in the magnon dispersion , the high frequency peak is suppressed due to magnon damping , and the overall spectral support narrows considerably . </S>",
    "<S> additionally we investigate final - state interactions by solving the bethe - salpeter equation to @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to collinear antiferromagnets , the non - collinear nature of the magnetic ground state leads to an irreducible magnon scattering which is retarded and non - separable already to lowest order . </S>",
    "<S> we show that final - state interactions lead to a rather broad raman - continuum centered around approximately twice the roton-energy . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the dependence on the scattering geometry . </S>"
