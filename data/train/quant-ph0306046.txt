    "in many quantum information applications a basic ingredient is a strongly squeezed gaussian state  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the generation of such a state is often fraught with technical difficulties , as demonstrated by vacuum squeezed light from a subthreshold optical parametric oscillator system , which involves a laser , an upconversion process and the squeezing interaction itself  @xcite .",
    "owing to this complexity it will appear fruitful to devise some alternative systems , capable of producing efficient squeezing with a higher degree of simplicity and hence scalability . towards this aim",
    "we investigate , theoretically , the amount of squeezing that can be expected in a certain polarization state of a laser beam using a polarization nondegenerate ( type ii ) second harmonic generation ( shg ) process located inside a laser cavity .",
    "the intensity noise of a standard laser operating well above laser threshold is usually at the quantum noise limit ( qnl ) provided that the pump source is at the qnl  @xcite .",
    "it is , however , possible to enforce squeezed state production via different means .",
    "regularizing the pumping mechanism , e.g. using a sub - poissonian pump , may lead to amplitude squeezing at low frequencies of the laser field  @xcite .",
    "this has been shown experimentally for semiconductor lasers , pumped with a sub - poissonian electrical current  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , squeezed states can be produced by some mechanisms intrinsic to the laser medium .",
    "for example if the decay rate from the lower lasing level and the pumping rate are matched  @xcite or if the coherence effect between the pump levels plays a significant role  @xcite , amplitude squeezing is expected to occur . finally , squeezing effects",
    "are anticipated to appear if a nonlinear @xmath0-crystal is placed inside the laser cavity  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the system comprising a polarization degenerate ( type i phase matched ) shg crystal internal to a laser has been investigated theoretically .",
    "garcia - fernandez _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and levien _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that perfect quadrature squeezing may be obtained in the laser field and the upconverted second harmonic field , respectively , for certain settings of the decay rates involved .",
    "a rigorous treatment of the same system was carried out by white _",
    "et al . _",
    "contrary to other theoretical investigations , these authors included the effect of very fast dephasing of laser coherence , a practical fact in all common laser systems .",
    "they found that the inclusion of this effect leads to additional noise , obscuring the squeezing to the extent that the experiment is not feasible for squeezing production using a type i shg crystal .",
    "this conclusion has been further corroborated by the fact that squeezing effects from a laser with internal frequency doubling have so far never been observed experimentally .",
    "however , in this paper we show that one should not give up on a up - conversion process internal to a laser as a source of efficiently squeezed light . rather than incorporating a type i crystal inside the laser cavity , as done in ref .",
    "@xcite , we here consider the case of a type ii phase matched crystal placed inside the cavity . in a type ii shg process , two fundamental beams along the crystal axes have to be excited . we show that this extra degree of polarization freedom may give rise to very efficient squeezing of a certain polarization state of the fundamental field .",
    "the way of attacking the problem is to derive a set of linearized langevin equation for the fluctuations of the atomic variables and the fundamental fields ( section  [ sec2 ] ) and together with the steady state values derive the spectrum for the relevant quadrature ( section  [ sec3 ] ) . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    "we discuss the experimental feasibility and calculate the degree of squeezing that might be expected in a realistic system .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec4 ] we conclude this work .",
    "many different approaches have been developed to characterize the quantum fluctuations of a laser .",
    "here we use a linearized input - output approach in which linearized quantum langevin equations , derived from the hamiltonian , are solved directly in fourier space to yield solutions for the quadrature noise spectra . details regarding such derivation for a laser system ( without a nonlinear crystal )",
    "can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this section",
    "we use this approach to describe a system consisting of a laser crystal and a type ii nonlinear crystal for shg located inside a commen cavity .    a schematic diagram of the model is shown in fig .  [ app2_laser]a .",
    "the frequency doubling laser consists of a four level laser crystal ( with one of the levels adiabattically eliminated ) , a type ii nonlinear medium and two orthogonally polarized ring modes ; the parallel polarized mode , @xmath1 , and the orthogonally polarized mode , @xmath2 ( see fig .  [ bases ] ) .",
    "the former mode constitutes the laser mode as well as one of the fundamental modes of the type ii shg process .",
    "this mode is therefore coupled to the lasing atoms via the coupling strength , @xmath3 , and to the nonlinear crystal via the coupling parameter , @xmath4 .",
    "the orthogonally polarized mode also has to be taken into account due to the nondegenerate polarization character of the shg process .",
    "we assume that this mode does not couple directly to the laser medium .",
    "this is a good assumption as long as the mode occupies the vacuum state , but it becomes invalid when the mode is intense .",
    "however , the implementation of an extra ring cavity , which is coupled to the laser cavity around the shg - crystal , assures that this assumption is valid .",
    "we should point out that we consider the system in a basis which is rotated 45@xmath5 with respect to the basis spanned by the principal axes of the nonlinear crystal  @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ bases ] .",
    "the reason for this basis shift is to make the intense laser field parallel to one of the fundamental fields and also because , as we will see soon , these polarization directions are particularly interesting .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the internal mode interaction in the laser- and the shg - process is @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the collective atomic lowering and raising operators between level 2 and 3 .",
    "the second harmonic mode is represented by the annihilation operator @xmath9 and the creation operator @xmath10 . using the interaction hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) together with the reservoir hamiltonian a set of quantum langevin equations of motion for the internal field operators , the occupation operators and the coherence operators can be derived directly  @xcite .",
    "we introduce a series of assumptions consistent with most laser systems with intra - cavity shg .",
    "firstly , we assume that the decay rate of the second harmonic field is high ; the field escapes the cavity immediately after its generation , enabling an adiabatical elimination from the langevin equations .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the laser coherence , the pump coherence , the pump cavity and the upper level decay very rapidly .",
    "this enables an adiabatical elimination of the pump mode and the occupation operator of the upper level ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "this results in a three - level laser description as shown in fig .",
    "[ app2_laser]b .",
    "the steady - state solutions for the atomic populations and the fields are required to evaluate the field spectra .",
    "the semiclassical equations of motion are given by @xmath11 @xmath12 is the population of level @xmath13 scaled by the number of atoms @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xmath16 are the amplitudes scaled by @xmath17 .",
    "the total decay rates for the ring modes are @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the pump rate is denoted by @xmath20 and the decay rate between level 3 and 2 ( 2 and 1 ) is given by @xmath21(@xmath22 ) .",
    "@xmath23 is the stimulated emission rate per photon for the laser mode and the non - linear coupling parameter is @xmath24 , which is proportional to @xmath25 .",
    "homogeneous steady - state solutions are derived by equating ( [ app_classic ] ) to zero whereby three different solutions are found .",
    "the solutions for the internal fields depend on the power level of the beam , pumping the laser process , and can be divided into three regimes as shown in fig .",
    "[ app2_laser2]a .",
    "below threshold for laser action , we naturally have @xmath26 ( region ( i ) ) . above laser threshold one of the field solutions",
    "destabilizes associated with the occurrence of the parallel polarized fundamental field , e.g. the laser field ( region(ii ) ) .",
    "another instability , which corresponds to the emergence of the orthogonally polarized fundamental mode , can be reached by increasing the pump power further ( region(iii ) ) .    for completeness , the second harmonic power is shown in fig .",
    "[ app2_laser2]b , and we observe that , due to the back - conversion ( associated with the generation of a bright orthogonally polarized mode ) , the second harmonic output clamps at a certain value .    . solid curve in ( a ) represents the parallel polarized field ( the laser field ) amplitude while the dashed curve is the orthogonally polarized mode .",
    "( b ) the second harmonic power versus the coupling strength.__,width=264 ]    to solve for the quantum dynamics we now conduct a linearization approximation by inserting the superpositions @xmath27 into the quantum langevin equations .",
    "we then arrive at the following set of linearized langevin equations for the quadrature fluctuations of the fundamental fields @xmath28 where the quadrature fluctuation amplitudes , @xmath29 , of the fields are defined by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 represent the amplitude and phase quadratures , respectively . @xmath33 and @xmath34 apply to the amplitude and the phase quadrature , respectively .",
    "@xmath35 for the amplitude quadrature while @xmath36 for the phase quadrature . in both equations",
    "the ` plus ' sign and ` minus ' sign are associated with the amplitude and phase , respectively .",
    "the operators @xmath37 represent the input fluctuations associated with the various passive loss mechanism while @xmath38 is the fluctuations in the laser pump mode . @xmath39 and @xmath40 are fluctuations associated with the atomic populations in the two lasing levels ; level 2 and 3 .",
    "finally , the decay rates for the two fundamental fields , @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) , are associated with the losses for the cavity mirrors and the other passive losses , respectively .",
    "from the langevin expressions we see that the quadratures for the parallel polarized mode are , not surprisingly , directly coupled to the laser process .",
    "this means that the laser noise adds considerable noise to the parallel polarized mode , which is subsequently transferred into the orthogonally polarized mode .",
    "therefore , we might expect that the laser source has an adverse impact on the production of squeezed light , an expectation also alluded to by white _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for type i shg inside a laser cavity .",
    "however , we see that in the regime where the orthogonally polarized mode is unexcited , corresponding to region ( ii ) in fig .  [ app2_laser2]a ,",
    "i.e. @xmath44 , the mode decouples from the parallel polarized mode . in turn",
    "this means that the laser noise stays in the latter mode and the orthogonal polarization mode evolves independent of the laser mode . setting @xmath44 in the langevin equation for the phase quadrature for the orthogonally polarized mode we find @xmath45    we proceed by evaluating the output fluctuations of the orthogonally polarized mode , @xmath46 in frequency space , and",
    "subsequently derive the phase quadrature spectrum : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the analyzing frequency and @xmath49 this corresponds to the steady - state solution indicated by region ( ii ) in fig .",
    "[ app2_laser2]a .",
    "we immediately see that the expression for the spectrum ( [ variance ] ) resembles the one for a subthreshold optical parametric oscillator  @xcite .",
    "it is a well known fact that such a process is capable of producing perfect squeezing near its oscillation threshold  @xcite .    strictly speaking the linearization approximation breaks down when the steady - state solution becomes comparable to the size of its fluctuations .",
    "therefore , in the above mentioned case where @xmath50 , the linearization approximation is invalid .",
    "however , in a realistic system a small part of the parallel polarized field will always be coupled into the orthogonally polarized wave due to inevitable imperfect alignment of the direction of the laser polarization .",
    "in fact , only a few microwatts have to be transferred from the laser polarization to the orthogonal polarization mode to justify the linearization approximation . due to the vanishingly small amount of light , which is transferred between the two polarization modes ,",
    "the seeded light will be at the qnl .",
    "therefore , the asymmetry will not be detrimental to the production of squeezed light .",
    "we now proceed with a discussion of the experimental feasibility of generating squeezed light in the system mentioned above under realistic conditions .",
    "a practical setup has to fulfill a number of important criteria : it is important to maintain low losses at the orthogonally polarized states in order to obtain high squeezing .",
    "both the parallel and orthogonal polarization states have to be kept simultaneously at resonance .",
    "it is crucial to make the type - ii phase matched nonlinear crystal work as a full wave plate to avoid unwanted cross coupling between the two polarization states .",
    "finally beam walk - off has to be eliminated since it introduces cross coupling between the polarization states .",
    "a setup that fulfills the above mentioned design criteria is shown in fig .",
    "[ sqz2 ] . here a standard unidirectional bow - tie ring laser , confined by the mirrors m1-m4 , is coupled to a secondary resonator through polarization beam splitters e.g. wollaston prism polarizers ( wp ) . using wollaston prisms ,",
    "low losses are obtained in both cavities and a high extinction ratio is possible .",
    "therefore , the parallel polarized wave circulates in the laser cavity while the orthogonally polarized wave is confined in the coupled cavity , which is defined by the two prisms and the mirrors m5 and m6 .",
    "the second cavity can be locked resonantly to the laser , using normal locking techniques by probing the coupled cavity in the counterpropagating direction with a fraction of the laser field that leaks out of mirror m3 .",
    "/2 : half - wave plate .",
    "_ , width=264 ]    a phase - matching scheme without beam walk - off has to be chosen in order to avoid direct coupling of the fundamental fields .",
    "this is achieved either by choosing a lasing wavelength where noncritical phasematching can be obtained using a type ii crystal e.g. ktp at 1080  nm  @xcite or by co - doping the nonlinear crystal to match the desired lasing wavelength  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , careful temperature control should be applied to stabilize the non - linear crystal as a full wave plate .",
    "optimum squeezing in the orthogonally polarized vacuum state occurs at the point of its oscillation , which corresponds to : @xmath51 .",
    "thus we can estimate the diode pump strength needed to reach the point of instability and hence optimum squeezing . using realistic values of @xmath52 s@xmath53 and @xmath54 s@xmath53 we find @xmath55 , which again corresponds to a pump rate of 12.6 s@xmath53 .",
    "this pump rate is readily reached , using e.g. a diodepumped nd : yvo@xmath56 laser .    in fig .",
    "[ sqz2 ] we have plotted the expected degree of squeezing at 2  mhz as a function of the pump rate normalized to the pump rate at the instability point . in calculating this degree of squeezing we have used realistic parameters for the laser medium , the cavity and the non - linear medium ( see fig . text ) .",
    "squeezing at oscillation threshold is given by @xmath57 from this expression and using the parameters mentioned above we estimate that as much as 7.5  db squeezing at 2  mhz should be observable in a realistic experiment .    , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61.__,width=264 ]",
    "we have investigated , theoretically , squeezing in a frequency doubler based on a type ii phase matched nonlinear crystal located inside a laser cavity .",
    "the system is resonant for two orthogonal polarizations directions of the fundamental field ( doubly resonant for the fundamental ) while the generated second harmonic field is allowed to escape freely .",
    "contrary to previously published results concerning type i frequency doubling , where pump laser noise couples strongly into the quadratures of the generated laser field and subsequently into the generated second harmonic light , we find that in the regime between the threshold for generation of the parallel polarized fundamental laser field and the threshold for down - conversion into the orthogonally polarized fundamental field it is possible to obtain squeezing in the fundamental field .",
    "in fact , we show that the langevin equation for the phase quadrature of the orthogonally polarized fundamental is identical to the one for sub - threshold optical parametric oscillation .",
    "consequently , we claim that our setup can in principle produce perfectly squeezed light in the orthogonally polarized fundamental field near the threshold for down - conversion .",
    "we propose an experiment for verification of this idea based on a unidirectional bow - tie laser with a type ii phase matched second order nonlinear crystal .",
    "the resonance for the orthogonally polarized light is provided by a separate cavity , which is aligned with the laser cavity by means of polarization dependent components .",
    "the advantage of the proposed technique is its simplicity compared to previous setups for subthreshold optical parametric oscillators , which require locking between the laser cavity , the upconverter the squeezing cavity and a reference beam .",
    "we believe the proposed method with carefully aligned components will allow detection of squeezed light from a frequency doubler internal to a laser , a process which has so far not been practical due different noise sources triggered by the laser process .",
