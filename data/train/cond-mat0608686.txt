    "bareh@xmath0 is the prototypical member of a family of hydrides , based on ( reh@xmath3 and ( tch@xmath3 structural units . @xcite these compounds are of interest from a fundamental point of view @xcite because of the unusual coordination of the transition metal atoms , which are surrounded by 9 hydrogen atoms , with relatively short metal - h bond lengths and are in an high formal valence state of 7 .",
    "these compounds are also of practical interest because of the high hydrogen to metal ratio of 4.5 in bareh@xmath0 .",
    "although no mn based examples of these compounds have been synthesized to date , the hypothetical 3@xmath1 analogue , mgmnh@xmath0 , would have a hydrogen content in excess of 10 weight percent .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to analyze the electronic structure of bareh@xmath0 in order to understand its bonding and the prospects for synthesis of mn based analogues .",
    "this follows a previous electronic structure calculation by orgaz and gupta , @xcite done using the x - ray crystal structure of ref . and the @xmath4 method .",
    "the present calculations were done using a general potential self - consistent method , with calculated h positions , and allow us to present a more accurate electronic structure and detailed analysis of the bonding .    the crystal structure ( spacegroup @xmath5 ) , which was determined using x - ray diffraction by stetson and co - workers , @xcite is depicted in fig .",
    "[ structure ] .",
    "it consists of alternating triangular layers of ba and re stacked along the @xmath6-axis , such that the re are at the center of trigonal prisms formed by the ba .",
    "each re is coordinated by three h atoms in its own plane ( the h1 ) positions , and six other h atoms ( the h2 ) above and below the plane .",
    "these h2 atoms form a trigonal prism .",
    "thus the h atoms are arranged in tricapped trigonal prisms around the re atoms .",
    "the unit cell contains two ( reh@xmath3 units , stacked so that the orientation of these units alternates along the hexagonal @xmath6-axis .    0.4 cm , showing ba and reh@xmath0 layers stacked along the @xmath6-axis ( top ) and the structure of the hexagonal planes ( bottom ) .",
    "the h1 and h2 sites are shown by small light and dark red spheres , respectively , ba by large light green spheres , and re by large dark blue spheres .",
    "the atomic coordinates are those obtained by lda structure relaxation.,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ] 0.4 cm",
    "the calculations reported here were done within the local density approximation ( lda ) using the general potential linearized augmented planewave ( lapw ) method .",
    "@xcite local orbitals @xcite were used for the semicore states ( re 5@xmath2 and 5@xmath7 , and ba 5@xmath2 and 5@xmath7 ) , and to relax the linearization of the @xmath1 bands .",
    "lapw sphere radii of 2.0 @xmath8 and 1.1 @xmath8 were used for the metal and h atoms , respectively .",
    "we used well converged basis sets consisting of more than 3200 lapw functions and local orbitals for the two formula unit primitive cell .",
    "we tested larger basis sets , but found no significant changes in the results .",
    "we also tested various brillouin zone samplings for the iteration to self - consistency , but found that the results were already converged at a sampling of 6 special * k*-points in the irreducible wedge of the hexagonal zone .",
    "no doubt this reflects the large band gap insulating character of the compound .",
    "the calculations for hypothetical bamnh@xmath0 were done with similar parameters , except that the mn and h radii were 1.8 @xmath8 and 1.05 @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "while the lattice parameters , metal positions , and basic structure determined by stetson and co - workers ( ref . ) are undoubtedly correct , it is difficult to accurately determine h positions in a complex compound containing heavy atoms without neutron scattering .",
    "accordingly , we used the experimental lattice parameters ( @xmath9=5.287 , @xmath6=9.323 ) here , but determined the internal coordinates of the h atoms by energy minimization within the lda .",
    "the calculated structural parameters are given in table [ struct - tab ] along with those of hypothetical bamnh@xmath0 , which is discussed later .",
    "as may be seen , the tricapped trigonal prisms are quite compact and regular in that the re - h1 and re - h2 bond lengths are short and similar , although there is a compression along the @xmath6-axis , as may be seen from the fact the the h2-h2 neighbor distance on the top of the trigonal prism is longer than the h1-h2 distance between the prism and cap hydrogen sites .",
    "it is also notable that the h1-h2 distance of 1.92@xmath10 is very short compared with most metal hydrides , which generally have h - h distances larger than 2.1  .",
    "@xcite these short h - h distances within the ( reh@xmath3 units suggest that direct h - h interactions may be important in forming the electronic structure , which in fact is what we find .",
    ".calculated structural parameters of @xmath5 bareh@xmath0 and hypothetical bamnh@xmath0 , obtained within the lda .",
    "the lattice parameters were fixed at the values @xmath9=5.287 , and @xmath6=9.323 , as reported in ref . for bareh@xmath0 . for hypothetical bamnh@xmath0 we used @xmath9=5.067 , and @xmath6=8.883@xmath10 ( see text ) .",
    "the coordinates of the atoms are ba ( 2@xmath9 ) : ( 0,0,0 ) , re / mn ( 2@xmath6 ) : ( 1/3,2/3,1/4 ) , h1 ( 6@xmath11 ) : ( @xmath12,2@xmath12,1/4 ) and h2 ( 12@xmath13 ) : ( @xmath14,2@xmath14,@xmath15 ) .",

    "as in the calculation of ref . , we obtain a wide band gap insulator , but the bands and the structures and positions of the features in the dos are significantly different . we obtain a direct band gap of 3.58 ev at @xmath16 , which may be an underestimate , as is common in lda calculations . in any case , this large band gap is consistent with the observed transparent nature of the material , and also indicates the nature of the band formation . in particular",
    ", it is an extremely large value for a crystal field gap , and also is not consistent with an ionic gap , since in a scenario with h@xmath17 and re@xmath18 ions , one would expect low lying re @xmath1 levels and therefore a small gap due to the high re valence .",
    "such an ionic scenario is also unlikely considering the short h - h bond lengths in the ( reh@xmath3 units .    0.4 cm   on a per formula unit basis .",

    "the integrations are on a per formula unit basis . , title=\"fig:\",width=230 ] 0.4 cm    examining the band structure in greater detail , we note that there are three manifolds of states .",
    "these are a narrow set of two bands ( one band per formula unit ) extending from -6.2 ev to -5 ev ( relative to the valence band maximum ) , a manifold of 16 bands extending from -3.3 ev to the valence band maximum and a broad set of conduction bands . while valence bands are often less dispersive than conduction bands in semiconductors , this electron - hole asymmetry is particularly noticeable in the bareh@xmath0 .",
    "as may be seen from the projections , of the dos there is no appreciable ba contribution to the valence bands , and therefore , as expected , ba occurs as ba@xmath19 .",
    "there is , however , ba @xmath1 character in the upper conduction bands starting at @xmath20 7 ev , and the ba @xmath21 resonance is visible from @xmath20 10 - 11 ev .    with the exception of the lowest ,",
    "split - off peak in the dos , which is h @xmath2 in character , the remainder of the dos shows a mixture of re @xmath1 and h @xmath2 character , demonstrating covalency between re and h. this is distinct from what is seen in naalh@xmath22 , for example . @xcite    the projected densities of states and electron counts are based on integration within the lapw spheres . in the lapw method",
    "these spheres are constrained to be non - overlapping , and in addition they must be chosen so that core states are contained within them .",
    "these constraints require the use of rather small spheres at the h sites . here",
    "we used @xmath23 = 1.1 @xmath8 .",
    "this is significant for the interpretation of the projected dos , because most of the h @xmath2 charge lies outside this radius . in particular , for a neutral non - spin - polarized h atom in the lda only 0.329 electrons are contained within 1.1 @xmath8 , and 0.305 electrons within 1.05 @xmath8 .",
    "this factor needs to be kept in mind when analyzing the dos .",
    "the advantage of the small h lapw sphere is that the h wavefunction near the nucleus is much less sensitive to the environment , which means that charge within this size sphere is almost entirely due to the h @xmath2 states , with very little contamination by charge entering from neighboring atoms .",
    "we verified this by integrating the @xmath7 projection in the h spheres , which would come from tails of neighbors , and found less than 0.02 electrons , supporting this conclusion .",
    "thus , integration of the h @xmath2 projection can provide a useful measure of the h valence , when normalized by the charge of a neutral h. the charge obtained in this way corresponds to h@xmath24 for both the h1 and h2 sites .",
    "this analysis can not be easily applied to the conduction bands because there is no plateau at the top of the re @xmath1 derived dos , presumably because of contributions from the free electron like states , which would provide h @xmath25 and other contributions .",
    "nonetheless , by this measure , 2 electrons per h would be included by integrating up to 9 ev , while integrating to 10 ev , where the re @xmath1 character becomes small , yields 2.1 electrons . in any case , these numbers indicate substantial covalency between re and h. this is also consistent with the large bandgap , which comes from the bonding - antibonding splitting associated with the covalency .",
    "to understand the bonding , we examined the symmetry of the h @xmath2 states when expanded about the re site , using the projections of the h tails into the re sphere .",
    "based on this , the lowest split - off peak containing 2 electrons comes from the symmetric combination of the h @xmath2 states , and is @xmath2-like at the re site .",
    "the second peak , which contains 16 electrons per ( reh@xmath3 unit has both @xmath7-like and @xmath1-like combinations of the h @xmath2 states . considering the short h - h distance in the h@xmath0 cage , and the simple electronic structure of h",
    ", the electronic states of a h shell should be ordered according to the number of nodes , yielding , in order , a fully symmetric state ( @xmath2-like ) , three states with one node ( @xmath7-like ) and five states with two nodes ( @xmath1-like ) .",
    "in fact , calculations for free be@xmath0 and mg@xmath0 clusters , @xcite which have 18 electrons and single @xmath2 orbital ions , show that these clusters are exceptionally stable and have a tricapped trigonal prismatic ground state structure , similar to 18 electron ( reh@xmath3 . furthermore , the electronic structure @xcite shows clearly separated groups of states , which are , in order , s - like , p - like and d - like . the energy splittings of the states within the groups due to the non - spherical , @xmath26 , symmetry are small compared to the splittings between the groups .",
    "this strong shell structure of the orbitals is associated with the stability of these clusters and their shape , as discussed by reimmann and co - workers , @xcite and may be expected to be a general tendency in 18 electron , 9 site clusters with only @xmath2-orbitals .",
    "this forms the basis for understanding the electronic structure and bonding of bareh@xmath0 , as schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ levels ] . specifically , the d - like states of the h@xmath0 shell have angular character about the re site that favors bonding with the re d - states .",
    "this yields five bonding states , which are @xmath27 bonding combinations in the radial direction , and five antibonding states , which have nodes between the re and the h shell .",
    "this provides an explanation for the asymmetry of the valence and conduction bands , since the antibonding combinations will be directed away from the ( reh@xmath3 clusters , leading to greater dispersion than for the bonding combinations .",
    "the strong bonding of the @xmath1-like combinations of h @xmath2 states on the h@xmath0 shell and re @xmath1 states leads to a large band gap , and shifts the bonding states so that they are in the same energy region as the @xmath7-like combinations of shell states , which are non - bonding with re @xmath1 orbitals .",
    "thus , the 16 electron main peak in the valence dos comes from 10 electrons in bonding re @xmath1 - shell @xmath1 states , and 6 electrons in shell @xmath7-like states .",
    "considering the large bonding - antibonding splitting of @xmath20 8 ev as measured by the energy separation of the centers of the valence and conduction re @xmath1 dos , there should be approximately equal mixtures of re @xmath1 and h @xmath2 character in both the bonding and antibonding states .",
    "this would yield an electron count of 13 h 1@xmath2 electrons in the valence bands ( including the @xmath2-like and @xmath7-like shell states ) and therefore a hydrogen valence of h@xmath28 , in reasonable accord with the estimate obtained from integrating the projected dos .",
    "0.4 cm   electronic structure from the levels of a tricapped trigonal prismatic h@xmath0 cluster ( see ref . ) and the re @xmath1 orbitals .",
    "the levels of the cluster are labeled according using @xmath26 representations , and also @xmath2 , @xmath7 and @xmath1 according to their approximate angular momentum character when expanded around the center of the cluster .",
    "note that all the h states shown are derived from different linear combinations of h 1@xmath2 orbitals .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=336 ] 0.4 cm",
    "the bonding mechanism discussed above is quite general in principle , depending on a proper electron count and the formation of strong bonds between @xmath1 orbitals and appropriate combinations of h @xmath2 orbitals .",
    "the @xmath1 orbitals of 3@xmath1 elements are much less extended than those of 4@xmath1 and 5@xmath1 elements .",
    "thus , as is well known , 3@xmath1 compounds typically have smaller band widths and reduced covalency with ligands than 4@xmath1 and 5@xmath1 analogues .",
    "this might be used to provide an explanation for why salts containing ( mnh@xmath3 have not been reported . nonetheless , considering that the bonding in bareh@xmath0 appears to be very strong , based on the large bonding - antibonding splitting and the fact that the phase competes with the very stable hydride bah@xmath29 , it is of interest to study the mn based analogue .",
    "we note that the binding energy of mgh@xmath29 is less than half of that of bah@xmath29 , and that the binding energy of beh@xmath29 is even lower , and so even with reduced stability of the anionic cluster , salts may be formed with appropriate cations .    in order to investigate the electronic structure of hypothetical bamnh@xmath0",
    ", we reduced the @xmath9 and @xmath6 lattice parameters of the re compound based on the difference in the covalent radii of re and mn ( 0.11 ) , to obtain @xmath9=5.067 , and @xmath6=8.883 .",
    "this corresponds to a volume reduction of 12.5% relative to bareh@xmath0 . using these lattice parameters",
    ", we relaxed the h positions in the unit cell .",
    "the resulting h coordinates and bond lengths are give in table [ struct - tab ] .",
    "remarkably , the relaxed structure maintains a cage of nine h atoms at approximately the same distance from mn , and with short h - h distances",

    "[ dos - mn ] ) , the electronic structure is qualitatively similar to bareh@xmath0 , although the detailed peak structure of the main valence band dos differs and the split - off h state moves to lower energy .",
    "this larger splitting between the shell @xmath2-like state and the shell @xmath7-like states is what is expected based on the smaller h - h distances in the more compact h@xmath0 cage of the mn compound , since this will yield larger hopping matrix elements and therefore stronger shell structure . as in the re compound , integration of the h @xmath2 projection of the dos , normalized by the amount of charge within a 1.05 @xmath8 sphere for a neutral non - spin - polarized h atom in the lda ,",
    "yields a hydrogen valence , h@xmath24 .",
    "furthermore , although the band gap of bamnh@xmath0 is reduced to 3.0 ev , the bonding - antibonding splitting as measured by the centers of the mn projection of the dos is nearly the same as in the re compound .",
    "the implication of the above results is that salts containing ( mnh@xmath3 may be realizable .",
    "synthesis may , however , be difficult because of competition from stable hydride phases . as noted",
    ", mgh@xmath29 is less stable than bah@xmath29 .",
    "however , mgh@xmath29 still has a binding energy of 75 kj / mol h@xmath29 , and furthermore mg forms other stable hydrides with mn , such as mg@xmath30mnh@xmath31 .",
    "@xcite    the lda often overbinds solids . nonetheless , it is of interest to compare the heats of formation of bareh@xmath0 and hypothetical bamnh@xmath0 .",
    "we calculated these values by subtracting calculated total energies of the elemental metals and the h@xmath29 molecule from the total energy of the compounds .",
    "for mn , we used the fcc structure and made a correction of 5 mry per atom , which comes from energy difference between the fcc structure and the ground state non - collinear antiferromagnetic @xmath32-mn , as obtained by hobbs and hafner .",
    "@xcite we made no correction for zero point energy .    with the lda value of the energy of h@xmath29 ,",
    "as obtained in a supercell calculation , @xmath33 = -2.294 ry , the resulting formation energies are -99 kj / mol h@xmath29 for bareh@xmath0 and -86 kj / mol h@xmath29 for hypothetical bamnh@xmath0 .",
    "the main uncertainties are ( 1 ) the crystal structure of bamnh@xmath0 , which if different from that assumed would lead to a higher stability , ( 2 ) the neglected zero point motion , which typically affects the cohesive energies by less than 20 kj / mol h@xmath29 and here would likely destabilize the compounds as the h - metal and h - h bonds are short , suggesting stiff phonons , and ( 3 ) the use of the lda , which based on calculations for other metal hydrides , @xcite overestimates stability typically by @xmath20 20 kj/ mol h@xmath29 , though this varies from compound to compound . in any case , based on these results ,",
    "we conclude that bareh@xmath0 and hypothetical bamnh@xmath0 have similar stabilities , assuming that the decomposition is to similar products , _",
    "e.g. _ bah@xmath29 and re / mn metal .",
    "electronic structure calculations show that the high coordination in bareh@xmath0 is due to bonding between re 5@xmath1 states and @xmath1-like states formed from combinations of h @xmath2 orbitals in the h@xmath0 cage .",
    "this explains the structure of the material , its short bond lengths and other physical properties , such as the high band gap .",
    "similar bonding is found in hypothetical bamnh@xmath0 and in fact both compounds are found to have similar cohesive energies . while bamnh@xmath0 may not be the most favorable target due to the stability of bah@xmath29 as a competing phase , our results suggest that synthesis of ( mnh@xmath3 salts may be possible and should be attempted .",
    "we note that the chemistry of mn vii is different than that of re vii .",
    "for example , kmno@xmath22 is highly oxidizing in aqueous solution , while kreo@xmath22 is not .",
