    "the photon is a remarkably robust candidate for a qubit , and easy to transport long distances ; however , as we know , they interact only weakly with each other , which makes the realization of quantum gates based on photons difficult . for instance , in linear optical quantum computation(loqc ) @xcite , extra measurements are required . on the other hand , ensembles of trapped atoms or molecules may serve as convenient and robust quantum memories for photons .",
    "they can act as an interface with flying qubits , and store and retrieve single photons , for example by electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite , which allows to keep coherence of quantum states up to several hundreds of millisecond @xcite .",

    "suppose the two most distant atoms are in the state @xmath403 .",
    "the energy shift between them should be around 1mhz , depending on the spatial distribution of atoms . in our scheme , where two atoms may also be in different single - atom states",
    "( actually in different manifolds ) , we could naturally extend our original analysis , but we expect a similar result .    in practice , we would want to use higher energy rydberg states ; for instance an @xmath407 state @xmath408 for the intermediate state and an @xmath409 state @xmath410 for the register state , to get both longer lifetimes ( more than 300 - 400@xmath85s for @xmath409 can be achieved in a cryogenic environment @xcite ) and a stronger dipole - dipole interaction . since higher energy rydberg states should behave more like the rydberg states of hydrogen",
