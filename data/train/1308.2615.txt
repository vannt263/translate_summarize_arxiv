    "in bulk transition metal oxides , @xmath0 electrons exhibit interesting and intriguing electronic and magnetic properties.@xcite thanks to recent progress of epitaxial growth techniques , perovskite oxide heterostructures can now be made and controlled at atomic scales so that @xmath0 electrons are confined within a region of a few unit cells ( @xmath21@xmath3 ) in the @xmath4-direction of the epitaxial growth@xcite . as a result of the confinement , many novel physical phenomena occur , including orbital - selective quantum well states@xcite , metal - insulator transitions and superconductivity tunable by gate voltage,@xcite enhanced thermoelectric effects,@xcite thickness dependent ferromagnetism,@xcite strong spin - orbit coupling effects @xcite , tunable correlation @xcite and a rich variety of phases including spin , charge and orbital ordering @xcite .",
    "a direct consequence of the confinement at the interface are , in particular , quantum well states , which can serve as a starting point for other complex physical phenomena .",
    "very recently , quantum well states have been convincingly observed experimentally by means of angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy for two distinct oxide heterostructures : ( i ) srvo@xmath1 ( svo ) ultrathin films @xcite , where electrons are geometrically confined inside the film , and ( ii ) srtio@xmath5 ( sto ) surfaces@xcite ( which can be considered as a sto / vacuum heterostructure ) , where electrons are confined in a two - dimension ( 2d ) surface potential well @xcite . in both cases , very similar orbital - selective quantum well states are observed : @xmath0 electrons with @xmath6/@xmath7 orbital characters exhibit a large quantization of the energy levels , whereas @xmath8 electrons exhibit a much smaller level spacing .",
    "this behavior has been ascribed to a nearly free electron ( nfe ) model in the literature@xcite .",
    "the nfe model is widely used in semiconductors heterostructures as well as for simple metal thin films@xcite .",
    "electrons are regarded to move almost freely with an energy vs.  momentum ( @xmath9 ) dispersion relation @xmath10 in terms of the effective mass @xmath11 .",
    "the confinement in the @xmath4 direction is described by a potential well @xmath12 of a characteristic length of 10@xmath3 .",
    "such a simple model with only two variables @xmath11 and @xmath12 works perfectly for semiconductor heterostructures . however , its applicability to oxide heterostructure is questionable , because it is well known that @xmath0 electrons are much more localized than the @xmath13 electrons in semiconductor heterostructures . in a perovskite oxide ,",
    "an electron is tightly bound to a transition metal ion site and moves in the crystal structure by hopping from one site to a neighboring site .",
    "one might therefore expect that a tight binding ( tb ) model will give a much better description of oxide heterostructure than the nfe model .",
    "while finalizing this paper , a related work by park and millis @xcite suggested a nfe model in - plane and a tight - binding model out of plane , where no hopping terms along @xmath14 and @xmath15 are considered and @xmath6 orbital in the @xmath16 direction is dispersionless .",
    "hence , while the tb modeling appears natural and first steps have been undertaken in this direction @xcite , a systematic comparison between tb and nfe model for oxide heterostructures is hitherto missing . similarly , there has not been a systematic investigation of how many tb parameters are needed for an accurate description .",
    "hence , it is unclear at present how complicated or simple the tb description actually is for such heterostructures .    in this paper , we do first - principles density functional theory ( dft ) calculations and construct from these tb models for describing the quantum well states in perovskite oxide heterostructures and surfaces .",
    "we further simplify our models to an effective hopping term @xmath17 and a local potential term @xmath18 , instead of @xmath11 and @xmath12 for the nfe model .",
    "we show that for thin svo films , the geometrical confinement is described by cutting the hopping term from surface layer to vacuum .",
    "the quantized energies are @xmath19 , where n is the thickness of the film and @xmath20 is a quantum number , ranging from 1 to @xmath21 . in contrast",
    ", the nfe model yields @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the lattice constant of bulk svo .",
    "moreover , we study the potential well confinement at sto surfaces or laalo@xmath5/srtio@xmath1 ( lao / sto ) heterostructures . here , we need to include a layer-@xmath24 dependent potential @xmath25 in our model . for a realistic potential well",
    ", we find the lowest quantized @xmath6/@xmath7 state is on the verge of becoming a surface bound state .",
    "hence , its spatial distribution can be easily tuned by a gate voltage or an electric field .",
    "our results show that the tb approach , instead of the nfe approach , is the natural basis for modelling heterostructures of transition metal oxides .",
    "our tb model can serve as a starting point for follow - up studies such as advanced transport or many - body effects .",
    "bulk svo ( fig.[fig1 ] ) is a non - magnetic correlated metal with perfect cubic perovskite structure of space symmetry group 221 @xmath26-@xmath27 .",
    "when studying its thin film growth along the ( 001 ) direction , we usually regard it as an alternating stacking of sro and vo@xmath28 layers . in this paper , we study symmetric svo thin films containing @xmath21 layers of vo@xmath28 and @xmath29 layers of sro so that the surfaces are sro terminated , see fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "we employ a sufficiently thick vacuum of 10  for the supercell calculation and vary the thickness @xmath21 one to ten svo unit cells .",
    "we fix the in - plane lattice constant to the calculated equilibrium bulk value @xmath30=3.86 , and optimize the internal coordinates .",
    "our dft results reveal that the surface oxygen atom relax outward by 0.06 , while the sr atom relax inward by 0.12 ; the relaxation of other atoms is negligible .",
    "we note that including sto as a substrate or making a svo / sto superlattice will not change our main conclusion .",
    "a vo@xmath28 terminated surface instead of a sro one on the other hand is rather different as this breaks the vo@xmath31 octahedral crystal field of bulk svo .",
    "first - principles density - functional - theory ( dft ) calculations are performed using the all - electron full - potential augmented plane - wave method in the wien2k@xcite implementation .",
    "we use the generalized gradient approximation ( gga)@xcite of the exchange - correlation potential and 10@xmath3210@xmath321 @xmath33-point grid .",
    "let us note in passing that including a on - site coulomb interaction u within the dft+u method does not improve the calculations : it can not give renormalized bands ; and , even worse , it will give a magnetic ground state inconsistent with experimental observations .",
    "considering the formal charge valence sr@xmath34 , v@xmath35 and o@xmath36 , bulk svo has a @xmath37 electronic configuration with one electron in the v 3@xmath0 states . due to the crystal field splitting of the vo@xmath38 octahedron ,",
    "three @xmath39 states ( @xmath8 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) are shifted down in energy while two @xmath40 states are pushed up .",
    "thus , one electron will partially fill three @xmath39 orbitals centered at the v sites .",
    "one of the @xmath39 orbitals , the @xmath6 orbital , is schematically shown in fig.[fig1](a ) as an example .",
    "this orbital predominantly expands in the @xmath41-@xmath4 plane , and a pair of its lobes point to a corresponding pair of lobes from @xmath6 orbital at nearest neighbor sites in the @xmath41 and @xmath4 direction , see fig.[fig1](a ) .",
    "the other two orbitals , i.e , @xmath8 and @xmath7 , have the same character and are related by cubic symmetry to the @xmath6 orbital ( i.e. , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively ) .",
    "our dft calculations show : below the fermi energy , o@xmath44 states are located between -7.2ev and -2.1ev ; near the fermi energy , ti 3@xmath0 @xmath39 bands are found between -0.96ev and 1.47 ev and are slightly hybridized with o@xmath44 ; above the fermi energy , @xmath40 states are located between 1.2ev to 5ev .",
    "thus , as expected , the o@xmath44 states are fully occupied , v @xmath40 states are empty , and three @xmath39 states are partially filled with one electron in total , equally distributed to the three orbitals because of the cubic symmetry .",
    "the @xmath39 bands are plotted in fig.[fig1](b ) along high symmetric @xmath33 lines .",
    "the total bandwidth is 2.5ev , ranging from -0.96ev at @xmath45 to 1.47ev at r@xmath46 . at @xmath47",
    "the three bands are degenerate . along @xmath47-x(@xmath48,0,0 ) , the @xmath6 band has a much smaller energy dispersion of only 0.12ev , whereas the two @xmath8/@xmath7 are degenerate in this direction and have a much larger energy dispersion of 1.9ev .     @xmath6 orbitals with lobes expanding in the @xmath41-@xmath4 plane .",
    "( b ) svo band structure calculated by dft ( black dotted lines ) and compared to the @xmath39 tb hamiltonian eq.([h ] ) ( red solid lines ) . along x-@xmath47 ,",
    "a red dashed line indicates a fit to a cosine function , and the blue one a fit to a parabolic function . ]    around @xmath47 , we fit the dft bands by a parabolic energy dispersion of nearly free electron @xmath10 as shown in fig.[fig1](b ) , and obtain effective masses @xmath11=0.56@xmath49 for the @xmath8/@xmath7 bands and @xmath11=8.4@xmath49 for the @xmath6 band , where @xmath49 is free electron mass . considering the rotation symmetry of the @xmath39 orbitals",
    ", we can argue that carriers with @xmath6 characters are light in the @xmath41 and @xmath4 direction , but heavy in the @xmath50 direction .",
    "in other words , along a specific direction such as @xmath4 , there are two light carriers ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) , and one heavy carrier ( @xmath8 ) @xcite . at higher energies , e.g. towards the x point ,",
    "the energy dispersion of the @xmath39 bands follows a cosine function , instead of a parabolic function of nfe , see fig.[fig1](b ) .",
    "since this high - energy part does contribute to the quantized energies in heterostructures , the applicability of the nfe model for describing svo thin films becomes questionable .",
    "the unit cell of svo thin films have @xmath21 layers of vanadium , containing 3@xmath21 @xmath39 orbitals in the supercell . in our notation",
    ", the @xmath4 axis denotes the out of plane direction and the @xmath50 and @xmath41 axis the in plane directions .",
    "an electron is allowed to move only in - plane whereas it is confined by the film in the @xmath4 direction .",
    "hence , instead of a dispersion in the @xmath4 direction , we obtain @xmath21 quantized levels for each orbital and in - plane @xmath33 point .    the dft calculated band structure for @xmath21=6 layers is plotted in fig.[fig2 ] along high - symmetric in - plane @xmath33 points . in total",
    ", 3@xmath326 @xmath39 bands are located between -1.0 to 1.5ev . analyzing the symmetry of the bands as well as projecting on each orbital and site , we are able to identify the character of all bands .",
    "when going from svo bulk to thin films , the translation symmetry along the @xmath4 direction is broken , whereas the in - plane translational and rotational symmetry remains .",
    "therefore , the initial triply degenerate states at @xmath47 split into a @xmath8 state and a doubly degenerate @xmath51 state .",
    "-direction leads to quantized energies levels which are indicated by arrows for the @xmath6/@xmath7 orbitals at @xmath47 .",
    "inset : atomic structure of the svo thin film . ]    at @xmath47 , the lowest band is of purely surface v @xmath8 character , followed by the @xmath8 orbitals of the second and third layer .",
    "the surface @xmath8 band is 0.16ev lower than the other @xmath8 bands which are all close in energy .",
    "such a band splitting arises from a local potential drop of the surface layer , as revealed by the wannier projection discussed below in table [ interface ] . here",
    ", we see that the dispersion of all @xmath8 bands is similar to that of bulk .",
    "this is because @xmath8 orbitals expand mainly in - plane , and the confinement along the @xmath4 direction has hence little influence .",
    "turning to the @xmath51 orbitals , we note that @xmath6 has a small and @xmath7 a large energy - momentum dispersion along @xmath47-x , i.e. , in the @xmath50 direction . of course",
    "the behavior is opposite in the @xmath41 direction , and the two orbitals are degenerate at @xmath47 .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath8 bands , the two @xmath51 orbitals exhibit a pronounced energy subband structure : six discrete energies are separated by an energy level spacing of about 300mev .",
    "this is because the @xmath6/@xmath7 orbitals expand in the @xmath4 direction .",
    "along this direction , their energy dispersion is large and hence the confinement along @xmath4 leads to a pronounced energy quantization if the electrons are confined in a thin film .",
    "projecting the @xmath6/@xmath7 states onto each site ( not shown ) reveals that all quantized @xmath6/@xmath7 states do not belong to a single layer , but indeed spread throughout the thin film .",
    "hence in contrast to the @xmath8 bands , each @xmath6 subband is a superposition of @xmath6 orbitals from all layers .",
    "orbitals as a function of svo film thickness @xmath21 at the @xmath47 point .",
    "results with quantum numbers @xmath20=1 - 4 are shown in black , red , blue and green , respectively .",
    "experimental results ( unfilled symbols ) are taken from ref .  ;",
    "dft results with a renormalization factor @xmath52 ( filled symbols ) are extracted from the band structures of svo thin films with different thickness @xmath21 , in the same way as shown in fig.[fig2 ] for @xmath21=6 .",
    "the nfe models gives @xmath53 ( dashed lines ) , and the tb model @xmath54 ( eq.([quantized ] ) solid lines ) .",
    "here , @xmath55 and respectively @xmath56ev , @xmath57 are estimated from the dft , which yields consistency results in the limit of @xmath58 . ]    the subband energy structure of the @xmath6 orbitals at @xmath47 ( arrows in fig.[fig2 ] ) have been experimentally observed in angular - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite .",
    "fig.[fig3 ] shows the comparison of experiment and theory for varying film thickness @xmath21 . to account for correlation effects beyond dft",
    ", we have renormalized the dft band structure by a factor of 1/@xmath59 with a renormalization factor @xmath59=1.8 taken from bulk svo @xcite .",
    "clearly , there is a good agreement of theory and experiment regarding the magnitude and the general behavior of the quantized energy levels .",
    "we note that a metal - to - insulator transition occurs for svo ultrathin film with @xmath602 @xcite , and hence the picture of renormalized quasi - particle fails in that region .    considering the good agreement between dft and experimental results",
    ", we now try to extract a simple model based on the dft results , for describing the quantum confinement . in a nfe model , the geometrical confinement of svo thin films is approximated by an infinite potential well , where the wavefunction at the boundary is hence zero . such a boundary condition results in quantized energy levels with energies @xmath22 at the @xmath47 point .",
    "as shown in fig.[fig3 ] , at low @xmath20 and thick films @xmath21 , the nfe model gives consistent results with the dft calculations .",
    "however , at larger @xmath20 and for thin films , i.e. , small values of @xmath21 , the discrepancy between the nfe model and dft calculations becomes apparent .",
    "this is expected since , in bulk svo , the nfe model gives parabolic energy dispersion @xmath10 which is only valid for a small momentum @xmath33 . at larger @xmath33",
    "the discrepancy between nfe ( parabola ) and tb model ( cosine function ) increases dramatically , as is shown in fig.[fig1](b ) for the bulk .",
    "for the same reason , the nfe model fails especially when the quantized energy is high ( i.e. , @xmath20 is large and @xmath21 is small ) , which explains the large difference in fig.[fig3 ] between dft and nfe model for such values of @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "in contrast , the energy dispersion of the tb model is in good agreement with dft for small _ and _ large momentum @xmath33 , see fig.[fig1](b ) .",
    "we therefore expect a tb model to reliably describe the quantum well states .",
    "in this paper we take maximally localized wannier orbitals for constructing a realistic tb hamiltonian .",
    "the tb hamiltonian has matrix elements @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes lattice sites , @xmath63 and @xmath64 denote orbitals in the wannier basis , @xmath65 represents a hopping integral from orbital @xmath63 at site @xmath66 to orbital @xmath64 at site @xmath62 , and @xmath9 is the wave vector . the wannier projection on dft calculated v @xmath39 bloch waves",
    "was performed with the wien2wannier package @xcite , employing wannier90 @xcite for constructing maximally localized wannier orbitals .    for bulk svo",
    ", we have a unit cell with a single v site and obtain three wannier orbitals which are essentially @xmath39 orbitals , but slightly hybridized with o@xmath44 orbitals @xcite .",
    "for simplicity we still denote these wannier orbitals by @xmath67 .",
    "all the orbitals are well localized with a localization function ( variance ) @xmath68=1.89@xmath69 ( defined in ref .  ) . for the following ,",
    "we introduce the notation @xmath70 , where @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 are lattice vectors along @xmath50 , @xmath41 and @xmath4 direction , respectively , and @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 are integer numbers .    through the wannier projection , we obtain all hopping terms and construct a tb hamiltonian according to eq.([h ] ) which exactly reproduces the dft calculated @xmath39 bands as shown in fig.[fig1](b ) . all the major hopping terms are listed in table [ bulk ] .",
    "the @xmath77 terms represent the local crystal field energies which is the same for the three orbitals due to cubic symmetry ( often denoted as @xmath18 ) , and zero for inter - orbital elements such as @xmath78 . for @xmath79 ,",
    "the inter - orbital hopping term is null due to symmetry , see positive ( red ) and negative ( blue ) lobes in fig.[fig1](a ) .",
    "the intra - orbital hopping term for @xmath6 and @xmath7 orbitals is large ( -0.259ev ) because these orbitals expand in the @xmath4 direction , while it is small ( -0.026ev ) for the @xmath8 orbital which does not .",
    "analyzing all hopping terms @xmath65 , we identify two basic characteristic features : ( i ) all the inter - orbital hopping terms are null or negligibly small , i.e. , for @xmath80 or @xmath81 they are exactly zero and for @xmath15 and @xmath82 they are tiny ( 0.009ev or even less ) , see table [ bulk ] . as a result",
    ", the inter - orbital hopping process can be ignored to a very good approximation ; all three orbitals are decoupled and can be treated separately .",
    "( ii ) along any specific direction , the next nearest neighbor hopping term ( with @xmath83 @xmath84 2 ) is generally small .",
    "hence , the nearest neighbor hopping already yields a good description for bulk svo .    .hopping integral @xmath65 in the maximally localized wannier basis for bulk svo between orbital @xmath63 at site 0 and orbital @xmath64 at site @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath77 indicates the local energy term ; @xmath79 and @xmath85 are the nearest and next nearest neighbor along the @xmath4 direction , respectively .",
    "all values are in units of ev . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ interface ]    in contrast to bulk svo , this thin film now has 18 wannier orbitals which are centered around the 6 v sites and which have a similar character as bulk wannier orbitals .",
    "nevertheless , the hamiltonian has some essential changes .",
    "one major change arises from the geometric confinement of thin films . in thin films ,",
    "the lattice vector @xmath62 becomes two dimensional with @xmath86 ; the previous @xmath87 component now points to different v sites _ within _ the unit cell and such a hopping is henceforth denoted by @xmath88 . in @xmath33 space",
    "this translates to a band structure which is dispersionless in the @xmath4 direction , but now we have @xmath21-times more bands .    table [ interface ] lists the calculated hopping integrals of the wannier orbitals . clearly there is no hopping from the surface layer ( 1st v layer ) to the vacuum , while there is a large hopping term ( @xmath89ev ) between 1st and 2nd v layer .",
    "in contrast , all other layers contain hopping terms of similar magnitude to _ two _ neighboring sites along the @xmath90 direction . in this sense ,",
    "the predominant effect of the geometric confinement is to cut the hopping term from surface layer to vacuum .",
    "this simply reflects that electrons are not allowed to move outside the thin films , as illustrated in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "such a geometric confinement plays a key role in quantum well states of svo thin films .",
    "there is a second important effect induced by the surface caused by the relaxation of the surface atoms : the surface sr atom shifts inwards 0.12  and the surface o atom outwards 0.06 , due to surface dangling bonds .",
    "this changes the local crystal fields in the surface layer and to a lesser extend in the neighboring subsurface layers . as listed in the table [ interface ] , the local crystal field energies ( 1st and 2nd column ) become site and orbital dependent .",
    "the biggest effect is observed for the @xmath91 of the surface layer which has a 0.16ev lower energy than in the second layer .",
    "this local potential is responsible for the dft pronounced level splitting of the @xmath8 orbitals at @xmath47 , see fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "we note @xmath18 and @xmath17 converge to the bulk values very quickly ; already for the third layer the difference to the bulk value is small . in this sense",
    ", a surface potential well will be formed . in the following sections",
    ", we will show that such a potential well plays a crucial rule for the surface confinement of 2d electron gas at sto surfaces and lao / sto interfaces .",
    "hence , we need to include this effect for surfaces and interfaces ( section [ sec : surface ] ) , whereas it is of lesser relevance and hence has not been taken into account for the thin film geometry ( section [ sec : thinfilm ] ) .      to obtain an intuitive physical picture",
    ", we will again simplify the first - principles based tb model .",
    "we first ignore the surface effect ( surface or interface potential well ) , and focus on the geometrical confinement of the hopping term only .",
    "we here employ the same approximation and parameters as in the simplified tb model for bulk in eq.([expression ] ) .",
    "that is , for a given orbital and specific @xmath92 , @xmath93 , we have a one - dimensional intra - band tb hopping . for the thin layer ,",
    "this single - band tb hopping is confined within @xmath21 sites .",
    "hence we simply cut the hopping term from surface layer to vacuum , as illustrated in fig.[fig4 ] and justified by table [ interface ] .",
    "the hamiltonian is then expressed as a @xmath94 matrix @xmath95 here @xmath17 and @xmath18 depend on @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath63 in the same way as in eq .",
    "( [ expression ] ) .",
    "the eigenvalues of the matrix are the quantized energies of the quantum well states that are confined to the thin film .",
    "for such a tri - diagonal matrix the eigenvalues have a simple analytical expression : @xmath96 where the quantum number @xmath20 indexes the @xmath21 quantized energy levels emerging from the confinement in the @xmath4 direction . at @xmath47",
    ", we take the bulk values @xmath17=-0.475ev and @xmath18=-0.01ev for the @xmath6 orbital .",
    "the quantized energies of eq.([quantized ] ) give much better results than the quantized levels @xmath22 of the nfe model , as the comparison with dft in fig.[fig3 ] shows .",
    "for a low quantum number @xmath20 and a thick film with large @xmath21 , the quantized energies are small , and the two models give consistent results .",
    "however , for larger quantum number @xmath20 or thin films with small @xmath21 , the tb gives much better results .",
    "this is expected , since the tb model yields a good description for both a small and large momentum @xmath33 , as is shown for bulk svo shown in fig.[fig1](b ) .",
    "while the dft clearly shows the superiority of the tb model , experimentally more data are needed for a clear statement in this respect .",
    "this is possible by growing thinner films ( small @xmath21 ) , where the separation between nfe and tb model becomes apparent .",
    "next , we will consider a surface potential well as a further source of confinement . in principle",
    "this can be done for the svo thin layer . however , in the case of the @xmath6 orbitals of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the quantum well state spreads over all layers of the thin film , so that the surface potential hardly affects the results of fig .",
    "this is different for the @xmath8 orbitals , as here the wave functions are localized within single layers and the surface layer has a rather different potential ( see table [ interface ] ) .",
    "the effects are however even more dramatic for a ( single ) surface or interface . here , without surface / interface potential the wave functions spread throughout the ( semi)infinite structure , and the behavior is hence the same as in the bulk . in this situation ,",
    "the surface potential is needed to generate a quantum well state , and we hence study sto surfaces and interface in the following section .",
    "in contrast to svo ultrathin films , where electrons are geometrically confined within the thin films by cutting the hopping terms from the two surfaces into vacuum , sto surfaces ( or lao / sto interfaces ) is a semi - infinite system with only one surface ( or interface ) where the hopping term is cut .",
    "hence the cut hopping in itself is not sufficient for a quantum confinement and quantized energy subbands .",
    "an attractive potential at the surfaces is required to trap electrons in a 2d conducting sheet .",
    "( black ) and @xmath6 ( red ) energy eigenstate due to a surface potential of strength @xmath97 and a width of three layers as depicted in the inset . ]",
    "generally , the surface potential can be generated by two sources : extrinsic defects such as accumulation of defects at the surface , and intrinsic surface effects such as atomic relaxation . to calculate the former one , we need the distribution of the defects , and then solve the potential well and 2deg self - consistently . in this case , the quantitative strength of the extrinsically induced surface potential depends on experimental details and might vary considerably .",
    "this extrinsic surface potential is not considered in our work and would add to the latter intrinsic one which can be well included by dft calculations .",
    "instead , we consider the intrinsic surface potential of a defect - free surface due to the atomic relaxation at the surface .    indeed , both the dft calculation of the latter @xcite and experiment @xcite show a potential well of width 3 to 4 layers and of depth 0.2@xmath20.3ev at the sto surface .",
    "the dft calculated band structure is very similar to the case of svo thin films , which indicates some general behavior of perovskite oxide heterostructure , such as the splitting between @xmath8 and @xmath6 bands , quantized @xmath6 subbands , and that the lowest @xmath6 orbital has a large spread into the bulk layers .",
    "( a ) and @xmath6 ( b ) character when confined by a surface potential @xmath98mev as depicted in the inset of fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "we show the charge distribution without ( filled circles ) and with an external electric field of -5mv per unit cell lattice vector ( unfilled squares ) .",
    "the layer with index 1 denotes the surface layer . ]    to model the surface potential well , we introduce a site dependent @xmath18 , as depicted in the inset of fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "the width of the surface potential well is taken to be three unit cell as suggested by both , dft and experiment .",
    "if we assume that the @xmath8 and @xmath6 orbitals have the same local potential @xmath18 , i.e , the same @xmath99 in fig.[fig5 ] , the two orbitals only differ regarding the magnitude of their hopping terms : @xmath100 - 0.03ev and @xmath101 - 0.475ev for hopping along the @xmath4 direction .",
    "we cut the hopping term from the surface layer to vacuum , and increase the thickness @xmath21 up to 100 sites to simulate the semi - infinite condition until the quantized energies are converged .    in the tb model",
    "we have to calculate the eigenvalues of the matrix eq.([matrix ] ) supplemented by a layer dependent @xmath18 .",

    ", no 2d electron gas can be formed at the surface ; both @xmath8 and @xmath6 electrons will spread into the bulk layers . for -30mev@xmath103 - 200mev ,",
    "only @xmath8 electrons are 2d confined , whereas electrons in the @xmath6 orbitals still spread into the bulk .",
    "this is because the @xmath104 hopping is much larger than @xmath105 , and hence @xmath6 orbitals extend more easily into the bulk .",
    "eventually for a potential strength @xmath106 - 200mev , both @xmath8 and @xmath6 electrons can be confined at the surface like and a 2deg is formed .",
    "both the dft @xcite calculated and the experimental @xcite observed surface potential @xmath97 is about -300 to -200mev per three unit cell .",
    "hence , we conclude that @xmath8 carriers are always localized at the surface , whereas @xmath6 carriers are on the verge of a 2d confinement .",
    "our results therefore suggest that whether @xmath6 states are quantized or not is very sensitive to surface details .",
    "this might explain why santander - syro _",
    "et al._@xcite observed a @xmath6 subband at sto surfaces , whereas meevasana _",
    "et al._@xcite did not .",
    "if we take @xmath97=-240mev , the splitting between @xmath8 and @xmath6 states at @xmath47 will be about 150mev , which is compatible with experimental and dft values .",
    "for this typical surface potential strength , we plot the charge distribution of the lowest quantized @xmath8 and @xmath6 states in fig.[fig6 ] .",
    "the @xmath8 state is strongly localized at the surface layer ( upper panel of fig.[fig6 ] ) , and hence its quantized energy in fig.[fig5 ] also basically reflects the local surface potential @xmath97 . in a similar way , the second quantized state is localized at the sub - surface layer , and its energy reflects the local potential of sub - surface site , i.e. , @xmath107 ( not shown ) . on this basis , we argue that the energy of the @xmath8 subbands @xcite can serve as a measure of the surface potential well .",
    "in contrast , even the lowest @xmath6 state has a very long tail extending @xmath210 unit cells into the bulk @xcite .",
    "that is , even though the surface layer has the lowest local potential , the lowest quantized @xmath6 state has actually a large contribution from the second and third layer .",
    "we emphasize that this tb result is consistent with dft @xcite .",
    "since the lowest @xmath6 subband is on the verge of a 2d confinement for a realistic surface potential well , an external electric field might strongly influence its 2d properties .",
    "we hence apply an external electric field which together with the induced polarization yields an effective internal field which we assume to be -5mv per unit cell .",
    "hence , we add a potential of -5mev per layer . considering the huge polarization of sto ,",
    "such an internal electric field is experimentally feasible @xcite .",
    "fig.[fig6 ] shows that the charge distribution of the lowest @xmath6 state changes dramatically , whereas the @xmath8 orbital is virtually unaffected .",
    "this striking result indicates that applying an electric field can not tune the @xmath8 charge carries , but does tune the @xmath6 charge carriers .",
    "this result hence indicates that electric field tunable properties such as superconductivity @xcite , spin - orbit coupling@xcite , and mobility @xcite stem predominantly from @xmath6 charge carriers .",
    "the fact that the lowest @xmath6 subband is on the verge of the 2d confinement might be the key for understanding all the puzzling behavior at lao / sto or sto surfaces .",
    "in this paper , we developed first - principles based tight - binding ( tb ) models with hopping @xmath17 and site dependent potential @xmath18 to study the quantum condiment of perovskite oxide heterostructures of two specific cases : ( i ) svo ultrathin films , where electrons are geometrically confined by cutting a hopping term @xmath17 from surface to vacuum ; ( ii ) sto surfaces or lao / sto interfaces , where electrons are confined by a surface potential well as described by a layer - dependent potential @xmath18 . in both cases , we have shown that a simple tb model gives a much better and more reliable description of @xmath0 electrons in transition metal oxides than a nearly free electron ( nfe ) model .",
    "already the two hopping parameters in the two inequivalent nearest neighbor directions of the @xmath39 orbitals , describes the complex dft and experimental bandstructure of svo films well , including the orbital - selective quantum well states . by means of the tb model ,",
    "we find that the discrete energy levels at @xmath108 with quantum number @xmath109 , in contrast the nfe model with levels at @xmath22 . for sto surfaces and lao / sto interfaces with a reasonable surface potential well , @xmath8 states are always localized as 2d carriers which is directly reflected by the discrete @xmath8 energy levels . in contrast",
    ", the lowest @xmath6 state is on the verge of 2d confinement and has a much large extension into the bulk layers . as a consequence",
    "we show that the @xmath6 charge distribution , but not the @xmath8 , can be tuned by an experimental accessible electric field",
    ".    generally speaking , the tb model can give an intuitive physical picture as simple as the nfe model but is much more accurate for surfaces , interfaces and superlattices of transition metal oxides .",
    "all parameters of the tb model can be determined from dft through a wannier function projection .",
    "the tb model hence provides the basis for subsequent calculations such as large - scale simulation , transport properties or many - body effects .",
    "incorporating also magnetism , correlations , spin - orbit coupling , and superconductivity will complete the tb model and allow us to figure out all the essential physics of oxide heterostructures .",

    "we still need to determine @xmath118 and @xmath119 , which depend on the orbital and direction considered .",
    "for instance , in case of the @xmath6 orbital and @xmath4-direction the hopping terms are as listed in table [ bulk ] : @xmath120ev , @xmath121ev , @xmath122ev , @xmath123ev ; for the @xmath8 , @xmath7 orbital related terms have to be taken . from these",

    "orbital , we then obtain @xmath127 - 0.423ev and @xmath128ev . in this direction ,",
    "the @xmath7 orbital has the same parameters due to cubic symmetry .",
    "for @xmath8 orbital on the other hand , the two effective tb parameters are @xmath129ev , and @xmath130ev . at @xmath47 ,",
    "all three orbitals are degenerate and have the energy @xmath131 .",
    "alternatively , we can fit @xmath104 and @xmath132 directly to the dft bandstructure : the band dispersion of the @xmath6 orbital from @xmath47(0,0,0 ) to z@xmath133 is 1.90ev .",
    "hence , eq.([expression ] ) and dft give the same band width for @xmath134ev@xmath135ev .",
    "the center of gravity of the band allows us to determine @xmath136ev .",
