    "the reason for this is simple : in contrast to those used in the original hall effect work with @xmath34=0.9@xmath39 cm @xcite , the best modern crystals with @xmath34=90n@xmath33 cm are so pure ( @xmath17=1.1@xmath49 m ) that the strong - field regime ( @xmath13@xmath251 ) can be reached at fields as low as 4 t .",

    "@xcite , this is in much better agreement with a calculation based on the full fermi volume ( i.e. the volume of the hole fermi - surface sheet minus that of the two electron sheets ) than the weak - field value of @xmath52@xmath29@xmath51m@xmath30/c .",
    "the fact that the hall resistivity can be accounted for so well in terms of an analysis based on orbital effects already gives good evidence that such effects dominate the transport properties of doped sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
