    "using both high resolution imaging from hst wfpc2 and spectroscopy from lris on keck , we study the cluster galaxy populations in cl1358 + 62 using 142 confirmed members .",
    "the imaging provides colors , morphological type , and quantitative structural parameters such as bulge / total fraction , bulge and disk scale lengths , half - light radius , galaxy asymmetry , and ellipticity .",
    "the spectroscopy provides membership , velocity dispersions ( @xmath1masses ) , and line indices for measuring recent star formation , e.g. h@xmath2 and [ oii ] . with our complementary approach",
    ", we can place constraints on the evolution of cluster early - type ( e / s0 ) and post - starburst ( e+a ) galaxies in cl1358 + 62 .",
    "jorgensen & franx ( 1994 ) suggest that elliptical and s0 galaxies ( @xmath3 ) are of the same galaxy class where e s are face - on members and s0 s the more edge - on ones , @xmath4 these are the same galaxies where viewing angle is the primary discriminator .",
    "if the cl1358 + 62 sample has ellipticals that are mainly round and s0 s that are elongated while both share a similar bulge fraction ( @xmath5 ) distribution , this would support a common parent population for both .",
    "we show the ellipticity distributions of e s and s0 s in fig .  1 ( left ) . results from the kolmogorov - smirnov tests of the @xmath5 and ellipticity distributions for this sample supports a common parent population for ellipticals and s0 s .",
    "e+a galaxies are still a mystery ( dressler et al .",
    "spectroscopically defined as galaxies that formed stars within the recent past ( @xmath6 gyr ; balogh et al .",
    "1999 ) , they may be the transition between late type spirals and early type systems . if e+a s are a snapshot in the transformation of the former to the latter , they are a fundamental phase in galaxy evolution .    to test if e+a s can evolve into the bright , massive early type cluster galaxies observed nearby , we examine the bulge fraction , bulge scale length , and velocity dispersion of e+a s in cl1358 + 62 .",
    "their scale lengths and velocity dispersions ( fig .  1 ,",
    "right ) show a population different from e / s0 galaxies .",
    "the e+a s in cl1358 + 62 may evolve into early type systems but they can not become massive ones ."
