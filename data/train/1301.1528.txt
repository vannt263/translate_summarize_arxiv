    "for signals buried into noise , to decide between the detected and non - detected statements is a long debated problem ; in addition , any non - detected decision must include a detection - limit statement .",
    "for instance , in analytical chemistry , the detection limit is defined as the lowest quantity of a substance that can be distinguished from no substance at all to within a stated confidence limit @xcite .",
    "the orthodox approach to the estimate of detection limits @xcite is based on the concept of confidence interval and of its interpretation as outlined in seminal papers by neyman @xcite .",
    "we investigate an alternative approach that uses bayesian inferences to test the different hypotheses and to quantify the signal amplitude or detection limit .    using the nuclear activation analysis as an example , that is , the detection of the nuclear activity of a radioisotope in a background photon - count , we illustrate how bayesian inferences can be used to chose between the signal - plus - background and no - signal hypotheses and to quantify the signal amplitude or detection limit .",
    "the contaminant amounts are linked to what it is observed  the photon numbers in given energy bins  by calibration factors .",
    "the sampling statistics applies to the counts and , therefore , our paper deals only with the observed signal and its associated noise , but the conclusions can be easily extended to the concentrations . as regards as the terminology",
    ", the background count is what would be observed in a non - contaminated sample , the gross count is what is actually observed , and the net count is what would be observed in the absence of background .",
    "the term measurand will indicate the mean net - count , whereas the terms background- and gross - signal will indicate the expected background- and gross - count .    according the neyman s view",
    ", the detection limits evaluated from the results of a large set of repeated measurement must bound a fixed measurand value with a given frequency .",
    "the detection - limit calculation uses hypothesis testing and the distributions of the measurement results given opposite hypotheses .",
    "firstly , the sampling distribution of the background is used to establish a critical limit @xmath0 such that , if the measurand is zero and the count is only noise ( null hypothesis ) , a net count smaller than @xmath0 would be obtained with a high probability , say 95% .",
    "next , this statement is reversed by choosing the detection limit @xmath1 in such a way that , if the measurand is more than @xmath1 ( alternative hypothesis ) , a net count greater than @xmath0 would be obtained with a high probability , say 95% .    when the measurand value matters , this frequency - of - occurrence view is not enough .",
    "for instance , decisions require probability assignments to propositions that assert the measurand value and , in turns , they require the application of the bayes theorem @xcite . in the bayesian approach ,",
    "signal detection and signal estimation are not independent problems and , in a large set of equal measurement results , the detection limit must bound different measurand values with a given frequency . hypothesis test requires to compare the probability of each hypothesis is true , given the data ; hence , the detected or non - detected choice is done according to the maximal probability @xcite .",
    "only after such a choice has been done representative values  for example , the mode , mean , or median  and confidence intervals  for example , bounding the measurand with a 95% probability  can be calculated .",
    "measurements of the impurity concentrations of the @xmath2si crystal used for the determination of the avogadro constant @xcite are essential to prevent biased results or underestimated uncertainties .",
    "the existing literature indicates that si crystals are extremely pure , but , to obtain a direct evidence of purity , we developed an analytical method based on neutron activation @xcite .",
    "nuclear activation analysis is based on the detection and counting of the @xmath3 rays emitted by the radioactive isotopes produced by the neutron irradiation .",
    "when a neutron is captured by a nucleus , a compound nucleus is formed in an excited state .",
    "this step is followed by a prompt de - excitation to a more stable configuration ; the new nucleus is usually radioactive and will de - excite by emitting delayed @xmath3 rays or particles . in the last case",
    "the resulting nucleus is often still exited and a further @xmath3 emission could occur .",
    "the energy spectrum of the emitted @xmath3 rays shows discrete peaks , which identify and quantify the radioactive nuclei and , consequently , the parent contaminants .",
    "after calibration against a known amount of contaminant , the number of counts stored in the energy bins relevant to peak gives the impurity contents of the sample .",
    "the gross count @xmath4 recorded in a given time interval in any bin of the multichannel analyzer includes a background count @xmath5 ; in addition , owing to the high purity of the si sample , for almost all the elements , the net count , if any , is deeply buried in the background . to extract all the available information , we assume that the @xmath4 and @xmath5 data are independent random - numbers .",
    "hence , had the background and gross signals been @xmath6 and @xmath7 , their sampling statistics , @xmath8 are poisson distributions having means @xmath6 and @xmath7 and their joint sampling distribution is @xmath9the problem is , firstly , to decide between the detected and non - detected statements and , secondly , to quantify the net signal @xmath10 or its detection limit .    , when @xmath11 .",
    "the arrow indicates the neyman s 90% confidence interval for @xmath12 when @xmath13.,title=\"fig:\",width=245 ] , when @xmath11 .",
    "the arrow indicates the neyman s 90% confidence interval for @xmath12 when @xmath13.,title=\"fig:\",width=245 ]",
    "the currie s construction of the detection limit is as follows @xcite .",
    "the distribution of the minimum - variance unbiased estimate @xmath14 of @xmath12 is the skellam probability density @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the modified bessel function of the first kind and the mean and variance of the net count @xmath17 are @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "hence , provided @xmath6 is known  which is a crucial assumption , the critical limit , @xmath20 , is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the solution of @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the cumulative distribution of @xmath23 and , for instance , @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , if the net signal is zero and the gross count is only background , a net count greater than @xmath0 would be obtained with a low probability @xmath25 .",
    "the net signal is assumed detected if @xmath26 and non - detected otherwise .",
    "the detection limit , @xmath27 , is the solution of @xmath28 where , for instance , @xmath29 .",
    "it is worth noting that a prior knowledge of the background signal @xmath6 is again assumed .",
    "the figure [ interval ] ( left ) illustrates the procedure ; if the net signal is more than @xmath1 , at least the 95% of the net counts are more than @xmath0",
    ".    we can circumvent the need to know @xmath6 in advance by using the neyman s construction @xcite ; a review can be found in @xcite .",
    "actually , this construction produces confidence regions for the @xmath30 pair , but , for the sake of simplicity , we fix the value of @xmath6 and calculate a confidence interval for the net signal alone . to this end , following neyman , we introduce a pair of continuous and monotonic functions of @xmath12 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , so chosen as @xmath33 $ ] is an @xmath34-interval for @xmath17 .",
    "that is , @xmath35 provided the net count is in the domain of the inverse functions @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 | \\lambda \\big ) = \\alpha , \\ ] ] by construction and whatever the measurand value may be .",
    "hence , @xmath39 $ ] is the sough @xmath34-interval .",
    "the figure [ interval ] ( right ) illustrates the procedure in the case when @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "according the neyman s viewpoint , in a long series of repeated measurements with fixed gross @xmath7 and background @xmath6 values , the 90% of the intervals calculated as indicated by the arrow will contain the measurand @xmath10 .",
    "the currie s constructions of the critical- and detection - limit rely on the prior knowledge of the background signal , which is not available . in practice ,",
    "the background count @xmath5 substitutes for @xmath6 , but this does not remove the conceptual difficulty .",
    "an alternative is to use the net count @xmath41 to determine the neyman s upper limit of the net signal .",
    "however , since the sampling distribution of @xmath17 depends also on @xmath6 , the neyman s upper limit is still a function of the background signal .",
    "additional troubles arise when @xmath42 , because the unbiased and minimum - variance estimate of @xmath12 is negative and unphysical @xcite .",
    "the problems inherent in the classical analysis can be solved by bayesian inferences .",
    "they are based on the product rule of probabilities @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the joint probability distribution of the signal values prior the data are available , @xmath45 is the joint probability distribution of the signal values  given the signal - plus - background hypothesis and after the data were collected , the likelihood that the signals are @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the sampling distribution @xmath46 evaluated in @xmath5 and @xmath4 , and the evidence of the data model is the probability distribution @xmath47 of the data , no matter what the signals may be .      a key step to calculate @xmath45 is to assign the density @xmath44 in the @xmath48 points of the signal - value space prior the measurement results are available . in fact , the only way to assign probabilities to the signal values consistent with the measurement results is to update , according the bayes theorem , the assignments made before the data are at hand .",
    "these prior assignments must embed all the information available , but , to avoid inferences affected by non - available data , no more than this information must be used .    by using the product rule of the probability algebra",
    "we can write @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 have the same functional form , say , @xmath52 , both the signals are strictly positive , and @xmath53 . eventually , @xmath54 must be uninformative .",
    "therefore , we impose scale invariance @xcite . hence , if @xmath55 , then @xmath56 no matter what the @xmath57 value may be , where @xmath58 is the probability distribution of @xmath59 .",
    "this ensures that the functional form of @xmath54 is independent of the duration of the counting interval .",
    "the reason is that , otherwise , we will embed into @xmath54  through a specific @xmath60-choice ",
    "an information about this duration .",
    "scale invariance limits the @xmath54 choice to the jeffreys @xmath61 distribution .    in the @xmath62 $ ] support , this distribution is not normalizable ; therefore , we limit its support to @xmath63 and @xmath64 so that @xmath65 where @xmath66 is one if its argument is true and zero otherwise .",
    "since this distribution does not allow us to calculate analytically the normalization integrals we will found in the following , it will be approximated as @xmath67 the limits for the support extending from zero to the infinite will be discussed where appropriate .",
    "the pre - data distribution of the net signal is the marginal distribution @xmath68 }   { \\lambda \\ln^2(\\lambda_{\\max}/\\lambda_{\\min } ) } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 and the dirac delta function @xmath70 is the distribution of @xmath12 conditional to the @xmath71 and @xmath72 values @xcite .      by combining ( [ sampling ] ) , ( [ p - rule ] ) , and",

    "the post - data distribution of the net signal is the marginal distribution , @xmath80 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 is the confluent hypergeometric function .",
    "representative values  for example , the mode , mean , or median  and confidence intervals can be calculated from ( [ d - marginal ] ) , but , contrary to a neyman s interval , a bayesian interval is such that , in a long series of repeated measurements of different net signals giving the same net count @xmath17 , a given fraction of the net signals in it .",
    "the no - signal hypothesis means that the joint sampling distribution of the data is @xmath83 consequently , given the no - signal hypothesis , the post - data probability distribution of the background signal is @xmath84 where @xmath85 has been obtained by normalization , @xmath76 $ ] has been chosen large enough that the integration limits can be extended from zero to the infinity , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .    to chose between the signal - plus - background and no - signal hypotheses , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , that is , between the joint sampling distributions ( [ sampling ] ) and ( [ onlyb ] )",
    ", we need the probability that each hypothesis is true given @xmath5 and @xmath4 @xcite . on the assumption that , before the data are available , the probabilities of the two hypotheses are the same , the post - data probabilities of @xmath88 and @xmath89 are proportional through the same factor to the evidences @xmath90 and @xmath91where @xmath76 $ ] has been chosen large enough that the integration limits can be extended from zero to the infinity and @xmath92 , @xmath93 . in ( [ hsb ] ) and ( [ hb ] ) , @xmath94 and @xmath95 are ockham s penalties for the size of the signal space @xcite . hence , @xmath96 and @xmath97    the support of the pre - data distribution must be bounded to a non - null lower limit and a finite upper limit . on the contrary , @xmath98 tends to one and @xmath99 tends to zero .",
    "this paradoxical result is caused by the largest parameter space of the @xmath88 hypothesis and , consequently , its largest ockham s penalty .",
    "this could appear a limitation ; however , a @xmath76 $ ] choice can be made on the basis of the background information .",
