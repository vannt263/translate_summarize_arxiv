    "however , to estimate the event rates , we need detailed information about spectral energy distribution , light curve shape , and luminosity function , which are not available for our samples . instead , we give crude constraints on how high event rate is required for short - timescale events to be detected with our short - period survey .",
    "we estimate the event rates by using a method based on @xmath24 method @xcite , which is used for estimation of galaxy luminosity function .",
    "the event rates of transients @xmath25 can be written as @xmath26 . here",
    ", @xmath27 is a detection efficiency ( @xmath28 ) , @xmath29 is the restframe time window for a rapidly rising transient to be detected with our survey , and @xmath30 is the maximum volume in which the transient is detectable with our survey . the summation is taken for all the detected objects .",
    "the difference from galaxy luminosity function is @xmath29 in the denominator to take into account the fact that transient event rate should be measured for a given time period . as the number of samples is small",
    ", we do not take into account redshift evolution of the event rate .",
    "we do _ not _ correct detection efficiency since the selection criteria are complicated : we need spectroscopic redshift to define the rapidly rising transients ( section [ sec : selection ] ) .",
    "thus , we assume @xmath31 , so that the analysis gives a conservative lower limit for the event rate ( see below for possible impact of this assumption ) .    then , the free parameter in this analysis is only @xmath29 . for simplicity , we assume this parameter is the same ( @xmath32 ) for all the objects by neglecting different redshifts . here",
    ", @xmath32 means the duration for which transients show a rapid rise with sufficient brightness so that they are recognized as rapidly rising transients in our survey .",
    "for the two objects detected both on days 1 and 2 ( shoot14or and 14jr ) , the duration of the emission is about 1.2 days in the observed frame ( 0.67 and 0.86 days in the restframe , respectively ) , and thus , @xmath32 is not much shorter than 1 day . a smaller @xmath32",
    "is not excluded for the other three objects but they do not show clear intranight variability for 1.6 - 3.1 hr in the observed frame ( 1.0 - 2.0 hr in the restframe ) . comparison with previously known transients ( section [ sec : lc ] ) and also with models",
    "( see section [ sec : model ] ) suggest that it is unlikely that the rising rate as high as @xmath15  @xmath33 mag day@xmath3 continues for @xmath34 days in restframe with sufficient brightness .",
    "thus , we adopt @xmath35 day as a fiducial value for all objects .    a typical 3@xmath36 limiting magnitude for the images used for candidate selection is @xmath37 26.0 mag .",
    "we use this value for the calculation of the maximum volume @xmath38 .",
    "in fact , for objects to be recognized as rapidly rising transients , they should be sufficiently brighter than the limiting magnitude on day 2 .",
    "thus , the effective limiting magnitude for the rapidly rising transients tends to be shallower than 26.0 mag . since analysis with a shallower limiting magnitude gives a smaller maximum volume and a higher event rate , our choice of deep limiting magnitude gives conservative estimates for the event rate .",
    "it is noted that the extinction in the host galaxy is not corrected and the true absolute magnitude of our samples should be brighter .",
    "however , if the extinction for the current samples represents an average degree of extinction , the estimate of @xmath38 is not significantly affected ( i.e. , our estimate crudely includes the effect of extinction ) .",
    "we estimate pseudo event rate for each object ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "for example , the maximum redshift , in which our survey would have detected shoot14gp , is @xmath40 with the limiting magnitude of 26.0 mag using absolute magnitude of @xmath41 mag and crude k - correction ( the term of @xmath42 ) as in section [ sec : lc ] .",
    "the comoving volume within this redshift in 12 deg@xmath13 survey area is @xmath43 0.16 gpc@xmath44 . for this object to be detected with our survey ,",
    "the required event rate should be @xmath45 yr@xmath3 mpc@xmath46 .",
    "similar analysis for shoot14or , 14 ha , 14jr and 14ef give @xmath47 1.28 , 0.70 , 0.82 , and 0.62 , and the event rates are @xmath48 0.47 , 1.9 , 1.3 , 2.5 @xmath49 yr@xmath3 mpc@xmath46 , respectively .    by summing up the pseudo rates , the lower limit of the total event rate is @xmath50 yr@xmath3 mpc@xmath46 .",
    "it corresponds to about 9 % of core - collapse sn rate at @xmath51 ( the core - collapse sn rate is @xmath52 yr@xmath3 mpc@xmath46 at @xmath53 , @xcite ) . note that the event rate is dominated by the less luminous object with smaller maximum volumes .",
    "the event rate for the two luminous events ( shoot14gp and 14or ) is @xmath54 yr@xmath3 mpc@xmath46 ( @xmath7 % of the core - collapse sn rate at @xmath51 ) , while the event rate for the three faint events ( shoot14 ha , 14jr , and 14ef ) is @xmath55 yr@xmath3 mpc@xmath46 ( @xmath56 % of the core - collapse sn rate ) .",
    "it is worthy to mention that the event rate of the rapid transients from ps1 is estimated to be @xmath57 of core - collapse sn rate @xcite , which is broadly consistent with our estimate .    as described above ,",
    "our estimate involve crude approximation , mainly due to ( 1 ) incompleteness of the sample , ( 2 ) a choice of simple magnitude limit , and ( 3 ) unknown transient duration . to anchor a possible range of uncertainties , we here discuss impacts of each effect .",
    "( 1 ) as discussed in section [ sec : selection ] , we could not take spectra of 6 sn candidates .",
    "if all of them satisfy the criteria of rapid transients , the total number of the objects is 11 instead of 5 .",
    "actual impact to the event rate depends on their luminosity and redshifts , but if all of them are assumed to be similar to our faint samples ( with a high event rate ) , the total event rate can be increased at most by a factor of about 2.2 ( 11/5 ) .",
    "( 2 ) if a shallow magnitude limit is adopted , it results in a smaller @xmath38 and a higher event rate . by adopting 25.5 mag limit , which is the possible shallowest limit to detect shoot14ef ,",
    "the event rate is increased by a factor of 1.7 .",
    "( 3 ) the effect of duration ( @xmath32 ) is crudely expressed in a term of @xmath58 and it can either reduce or increase the event rate . the event rate is reduced by 2 for the duration of @xmath59 days , while it is increased by a factor of 1.4 for the duration of @xmath60 days ( shoot14or ) .    in summary , our rate estimate is uncertain by a factor of @xmath61 for reduction and @xmath62 for increase . in either case , the event rate is not totally negligible compared with the core - collapse sn rate . given the crude approximation in the estimate , the true event rate can be comparable to the sn rate , i.e. , the rapidly rising phase can be associated with all core - collapse sne .      _",
    "shock breakout : _ the electromagnetic signal from sne starts with shock breakout emission .",
    "shock breakout occurs when the diffusion timescale of photons in front of the shock wave becomes as short as the dynamical timescale @xcite .",
    "a typical duration of the shock breakout is light crossing time of the progenitor size , i.e. , @xmath63 sec for a red supergiant progenitor with 500 @xmath64 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and shorter for more compact progenitors .",
    "timescales of shock breakout emission are much shorter than the observed timescale for shoot14or and 14jr , which are detected both on days 1 and 2 ( 0.55 - 0.72 days in restframe ) . therefore , they can not be shock breakout emission . on the other hand , the other three objects ( shoot14gp , 14 ha , and 14ef )",
    "are not detected on day 1 , and thus , the possibilities of the shock breakout are not ruled out .",
    "however , they do not show significant intranight variability within 1.0 , 1.1 , and 2.0 hr ( restframe ) on day 2 , respectively , and there is no supportive signature for shock breakout interpretation ( see @xcite for the detection of a transient with an extremely rapid decline , which is interpreted to be shock breakout emission ) .    _ cooling envelope emission : _ following shock breakout emission , sne show emission from cooling envelope @xcite .",

    "figure [ fig : models ] shows light curves of cooling envelope emission for red supergiant cases by @xcite , compared with light curves of our samples , sn 2010aq , and ps1 - 13arp .",
    "we divide these objects into 4 classes according to effective restframe wavelengths ( 2000 , 2500 , 3000 , and 3500  ) .",
    "the black dashed lines show the fiducial model with the ejecta mass @xmath65 , progenitor radius @xmath66 , and explosion energy @xmath67 erg .",
    "other lines show models with different mass , radius , and energy : upper gray dashed line ( @xmath68 ) = ( @xmath69 erg ) , lower gray dashed ( @xmath70 erg ) , and red dashed ( @xmath71 erg ) .",
    "the epochs of observed data are arbitrarily shifted to match the models .",
    "the brightness of observed samples is consistent or brighter than the red supergiant models . since the cooling envelope emission from explosions of more compact progenitor tend to be fainter than red supergiant case in uv at @xmath7 day @xcite , models with blue supergiant or wolf - rayet star progenitors do not give better agreement .    the light curve of shoot14jr is qualitatively consistent with a model of cooling envelope emission .",
    "shoot14 ha and 14ef can also be explained by the models , although they are detected only day 2 .",
    "since the cooling envelope emission peaks at a epoch when @xmath72 is fulfilled , the spectral peak at the rising phase is located at shorter wavelengths than the observed wavelengths .",
    "this is also consistent with the blue color of our objects .",
    "note that comparison with the models suggest an explosion energy higher than @xmath73 erg .",
    "in addition , due to possible extinction in the host galaxies , the true absolute magnitudes of our objects can be even brighter .",
    "these situations are also the case for sn 2010aq , where a model brighter than our fiducial model by @xmath74 mag gives the best match with the observed data without host extinction correction @xcite .    to understand possible varieties in the models , we also show selected numerical models for the early phase of type iip sne .",
    "the models are calculated with the multigroup radiation hydrodynamics code stella @xcite . for the purpose of parametric studies ,",

    "although there are some discrepancy between analytic and numerical models , the trend is similar : shoot14jr can be consistent with models while shoot14or is brighter and faster than the models .",
    "figure [ fig : dmdt_model ] shows the rising timescales and absolute magnitudes ( as in figure [ fig : dmdt ] ) compared with those of analytic ( dashed ) and numerical ( solid ) models .",
    "the black and red lines show the fiducial models and models with a higher energy . as also shown in figure [ fig : models ] , the light curve models are consistent with the faint three objects in our samples at @xmath79 days after the shock breakout .    in summary ,",
    "the three faint objects ( shoot14 ha , 14jr , and 14ef ) out of our five samples are interpreted to be the cooling envelope emission of red supergiant explosion .",
    "the epochs of our detection is likely to be @xmath79 days after the shock breakout .",
    "_ shock breakout from dense wind : _ shoot14gp and shoot14or , two luminous objects in our samples , are brighter and faster than the cooling envelope models . in fact , this difficulty is also found for the case of ps1 - 13arp , and @xcite suggested that it is shock breakout from a dense wind since the luminosity of the shock breakout from the wind can be more luminous than cooling envelope emission by factor of @xmath80 @xcite .    for the shock breakout from the wind ,",
    "the timescale to the peak luminosity reflects the diffusion timescale in the wind , @xmath81 days @xcite , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 is the mass loss rate and wind velocity , respectively . for our samples , the time to the peak is not tightly constrained , but it is longer than @xmath84 days for shoot14or .",
