    "various studies have shown that the `` forest '' of  absorption lines observed in the spectra of background qsos are a sensitive probe of the physical conditions of intervening gas ( e.g.  rauch 1998 ) .",
    "comparisons of galaxies and qso absorption systems along common lines of sight , therefore , allow us not only to determine the origin of qso absorption systems but also to study properties of tenuous gas around galaxies at large distances . over the past several years , studies of faint galaxies in qso fields have demonstrated that galaxies of a wide range of luminosity and morphological type possess extended gaseous envelopes of radius @xmath3 kpc and that known galaxies of known gas cross section can explain most and perhaps all of   absorption systems of @xmath4 ( lanzetta et al .  1995 ; chen et al .",
    "1998 , 2001 ) .",
    "a more detailed review of the relationship between   absorption systems and galaxies is presented by lanzetta in these proceedings . here",
    "we summarize the main reasons that support this conclusion as following :    \\1 .",
    "the galaxy  absorber cross - correlation function exhibits a strong amplitude on velocity scales of @xmath5 250  and impact parameter scales of @xmath6 kpc , and becomes diminishingly small at impact parameters beyond @xmath7 kpc on all velocity scales ( lanzetta , webb , & barcons 1997 ) .",
    "this indicates that  absorption systems strongly cluster around galaxies on dynamical scales of individual galaxies , rather than on scales of large filamentary structures .",
    "there exists a strong anti - correlation between  absorption equivalent width and galaxy impact parameter .",
    "namely , galaxies at larger impact parameters are found to be associated with weaker  absorption systems . including the intrinsic luminosities of individual galaxies as an additional scaling factor further improves the anti - correlation between  absorption equivalent width and galaxy impact parameter , indicating that the extent of tenuous gas around galaxies scales with individual galaxy luminosity / mass ( chen et al .",
    "1998 , 2001 ) .    \\3 .",
    "almost all galaxies that are at @xmath8 away from the background qsos and at @xmath9 kpc produce associated   absorption lines , indicating that the covering factor of tenuous gas around galaxies is approximately unity ( lanzetta et al .",
    "1995 ; chen et al .",
    "1998 , 2001 ) . on the contrary , almost all galaxies that are in the vicinities of the background qsos ( @xmath10 and @xmath9 kpc ) do not produce associated  absorption lines to within sensitive upper limits , consistent with the picture that tenuous gas around these galaxies",
    "are highly ionized due to an enhanced ionizing radiation intensity from the background qsos ( pascarelle et al .",
    "2001 ) .    by combining results of previous studies of extended mgii , civ , and  gas around galaxies ( derived based on analyses of qso absorption systems )",
    ", we can establish a schematic picture of the structure of extended gas around galaxies : a typical @xmath11 galaxy is surrounded by high column density gas of radius a few tens kpc ( e.g.  van gorkom 1993 ) , which , because of its high density , remains mostly neutral .",
    "the gas becomes more ionized as the gas density decreases with increasing galactic radius .",
    "low - ionization species , such as singly ionized magnesium mgii , become the dominant observational signature out to @xmath12 50 @xmath13 kpc ( e.g.  bergeron & boiss 1991 ) . as the gas density continues to decline at larger galactic radii , the gas becomes still more highly ionized .",
    "high - ionization species , such as triply ionized carbon , become the dominant observational signature out to @xmath12 100 @xmath13 kpc , at neutral hydrogen column densities @xmath14  ( chen , lanzetta , & webb 2001 ) .",
    "the tenuous gas continues to extend to at least @xmath12 180 @xmath13 kpc , at neutral hydrogen column densities at least as low as @xmath15   ( chen et al .",
    "1998 , 2001 ) .",
    "this picture applies to galaxies of a wide range of luminosity and morphological type .",
    "there is , however , a lack of understanding of the physical properties of extended gas at large galactic distances , such as number density , ionization state , and metallicity , because of limited information regarding kinematics and metallicity of the gas .",
    "the primary difficulty arises in acquiring a high - quality qso spectrum of wide uv spectral coverage . here",
    "we present an analysis of the chemical abundances , ionization state , and origin of a partial lyman limit system ( lls ; @xmath0 ) at low redshift ( @xmath16 towards pks0405@xmath21219 ) . combining the results of our analysis for the @xmath17 system with those for high - redshift  absorption systems obtained in the literature , we also present the first estimate of the total baryons in extended gaseous envelopes around galaxies based on a simple photoionization model .",
    "the absorption system at @xmath17 toward pks0405@xmath21219 ( @xmath18 ) was first identified in an hst / fos spectrum with a rest - frame  absorption equivalent width of 0.65   and a rest - frame  absorption equivalent width of 0.44  .",
    "subsequent echelle spectroscopy with hst / stis further revealed absorption features produced by h@xmath19 ( ) , c@xmath20 , n@xmath20 , o@xmath19 , si@xmath20 , si@xmath21 , si@xmath22 , possibly fe@xmath20 and fe@xmath21 ; and most interestingly absorption doublets produced by n@xmath23 and o@xmath24 at the redshift of the absorption system .",
    "we estimated the physical properties of the absorption system based on both photoionization and collisional ionization models , using the relative abundance ratios between different transitions .",
    "detailed analysis has been presented in chen & prochaska ( 2000 ) .",
    "we summarize the results here .",
    "first , all the ions except n@xmath23 and o@xmath24 showed consistent profile signatures that trace the partial lls , while the  and  doublets appeared to be broad with velocity centroids blue - shifted by @xmath12 30  from the other ions .",
    "the differences in kinematic signatures strongly indicate that the  and  doublets and the partial lls traced by the other ions do not arise in the same regions ( see figure 1 in chen & prochaska 2000 ) .",
    "second , metals that are associated with the partial lls showed a wide range of ionization state .",
    "we present the column density measurements in table 1 , which lists the ions , the corresponding rest - frame absorption wavelength @xmath25 , and the estimated ionic column densities @xmath26 together with the associated errors in the first three columns .",
    "the comparable abundances between various si ions indicate that the partial lls is photoionized .",

    "in order for the hot gas to remain at this temperature , we further estimated the mass of the galaxy or galaxy group that supports the extended hot gas to be @xmath55 , assuming a simple isothermal profile of a half - mass radius @xmath56 mpc . by requiring a cooling time longer than the dynamical time , we estimated the number density of the absorbing gas should be @xmath57 @xmath58 .    finally , we estimated the elemental abundances of the partial lls using the ionization fraction correction calculated from the cloudy model for an ionization parameter @xmath59 .",
    "in addition , we also estimated the chemical abundance using the @xmath60 $ ] column density ratio , which is a direct estimate of the oxygen elemental abundance in regions where the resonant charge - exchange reaction between oxygen and hydrogen becomes dominant .",
    "the results are shown in the last column of table 1 for an  column density @xmath61 .",
    "it shows that the partial lls would have @xmath62 solar abundance determined for carbon and silicon , @xmath63 solar abundance for nitrogen , and at least @xmath64 solar for oxygen . increasing ( decreasing ) @xmath65 by 0.5 dex decreases ( increases ) the abundance measurements by 0.5 dex .    to summarize , the  absorption system at @xmath1 is a chemically enriched partial lls that exhibits a wide range of ionization state and is likely to be embedded in a more wide - spread , collisionally ionized hot gas that gives rise to the absorption features of o@xmath24 and n@xmath23 .",

    "ground - based galaxy surveys ( spinrad et al .  1993 ;",
    "ellingson & yee 1994 ) of the field surrounding pks0405@xmath21219 have found an elliptical galaxy at @xmath66 and impact parameter @xmath67 kpc with a rest - frame @xmath68-band luminosity @xmath69 and ( 2 ) a spiral galaxy at @xmath70 and at @xmath71 kpc with @xmath72 . by carefully examining deep optical and near - infrared images",

    "the luminosity scaled anti - correlation between  absorption strength and galaxy impact parameter presented in chen et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we find that the elliptical galaxy alone can easily explain the amount of absorption . while it is not uncommon to find tenuous gas at large galactic distance ( @xmath74 kpc ) around nearby elliptical galaxies ( e.g.  fabbiano , kim , & trinchieri 1992 ) or in groups of galaxies ( e.g.  mulchaey et al .",
    "1996 ) , it is surprising to find metal - enriched , high - column density gas at this large distance .",
    "the spectral characteristics of the elliptical galaxy exhibit signs of recent star formation ( spinrad et al .",
    "1993 ) , therefore the physical process that initiated the recent star formation might be responsible for transporting metals to large galactic distance .",

    "abundance measurements of these elements determine @xmath78 and therefore reveal the mean baryon density @xmath79 in the universe when combined with measurements of the cosmic background radiation .",
    "measurements of the deuterium abundance along three sightlines toward high - redshift qsos have yielded a precise estimate of the baryon density of @xmath80 ( e.g.  burles , nollett , & turner 2001 ) . combined data from various cosmic microwave background experiments",
    "have also shown exciting agreement in the estimate of @xmath79 ( e.g.  wang , tegmark , & zaldarriaga 2001 ) .",
    "the consistent results in @xmath79 greatly increase the confidence in our current understanding of the formation of the universe . while all the baryons may be accountable by the  forest at high redshifts ( rauch et al .",
    "1997 ) , it has , however , been shown that the sum of all the baryons seen in different environment only makes up @xmath81 of the total baryons predicted by bbn ( fukugita , hogan , & peebles 1998 ) .",
    "finding the missing baryons is therefore crucial for establishing a complete picture of the formation and evolution of the universe .",
    "fukugita et al .",
    "( 1998 ) attributed the `` missing baryons '' to the hot gas around galaxy groups with temperatures @xmath82 k , a temperature range that is out of reach by existing x - ray facilities but may be probed using the  absorption systems observed in the spectra of background qsos ( mulchaey et al .",
    "results of hydrodynamic simulations also suggested that 30%40% of the total baryons are in ionized gas of temperatures between @xmath83 and @xmath84 k at low redshifts ( cen & ostriker 1999 ; dav et al .",
    "recent analysis of intervening  absorption systems indeed showed evidence that supports a significant baryon reservoir in the hot gas probed by the  absorbers ( tripp , savage , & jenkins 2000 ) .",
    "there is , however , a large uncertainty due to poor statistics in the line densities of the   absorption systems and unknown gas properties such as metallicity and ionization fraction of the gas . in addition , some fraction of the  forest have associated  absorption lines , a simple addition of the total baryon contributions from the two species will result in a double - counting error ( see the contribution by tripp in these proceedings ) .    because extended gaseous envelopes are a common and generic feature of galaxies of a wide range of luminosity and morphological type ( chen et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 ) , some fraction of the total baryons must reside in the gaseous envelopes of individual galaxies that have not been counted in previous measurements . here",
    "we present the first estimate of the total baryons in tenuous gas around galaxies on the basis of known galaxies that are represented by a galaxy luminosity function and of known gaseous extent of these galaxies .",
    "our analysis takes advantage of better known galaxy statistics and is based on hydrogen directly .",
    "it requires an accurate estimate of the ionization fraction of the tenuous gas , but it does not require knowledge of the metallicity of the gas .    to determine the ionization fraction of an absorber requires high - resolution , high - sensitivity qso spectroscopy to identify associated metal lines in the rest - frame uv spectral range .",
    "a handful of  absorption systems have so far been studied extensively for the ionization state of the absorbing gas ( bergeron et al .",
