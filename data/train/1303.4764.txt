    "superfluidity hallmarks such as persistent currents and quantized vortices @xcite may be precisely generated and their dynamics probed , and numerous measurement techniques allow for observations of density and quantum phase distributions . regarding simulations of superfluid dynamics in becs , common numerical approaches utilize the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) , a nonlinear schrdinger equation that incorporates a mean - field approximation to represent the bec with an order parameter , the familiar macroscopic condensate wavefunction @xcite .",
    "numerous variants of the gpe such as those that model finite - temperature environments extend the predictive accuracy of simulations @xcite . taken together , these features allow for highly synergetic experimental , numerical , and theoretical explorations of superfluid dynamics .    in this respect , bose - einstein condensates may be ideally suited for investigating quantum turbulence and the dynamics of interacting quantized vortices in compressible quantum fluids ; for recent reviews of this subject see refs .",

    ", vorticity appears in the form of superfluid - free vortex cores about which there is quantized flow circulation @xcite .",
    "whether in superfluid helium or trapped becs , quantum turbulence is often phenomenologically described as a tangled distribution of these quantized vortices throughout the fluid @xcite , and recent work with superfluid helium provides fascinating visual evidence for these vortex distributions @xcite .    in becs ,",
    "quantum turbulence is relevant to early investigations on the formation of large vortex lattices @xcite and routes to vortex nucleation by dynamical instabilities @xcite , and has been experimentally observed and explicitly addressed in these contexts @xcite .",
    "more recent experiments have been principally dedicated to the study of quantum turbulence phenomena and the related vortex distributions @xcite .",
    "images of vortex tangles in becs have also been experimentally obtained @xcite . yet",
    "while becs readily permit vortex observations , other aspects of turbulence remain significant experimental challenges within the bec field .",
    "notably , direct measurement of kinetic energy spectra is an open problem , whereas such measurements of liquid helium have allowed direct comparison of classical and quantum fluid turbulent energy spectra @xcite .",
    "the different approaches and systems for studying quantum turbulence are therefore complementary , with bec research playing a potentially important role in understanding the broad subject of turbulence , particularly in the context of compressible quantum fluids .",
    "more specifically , becs are now beginning to contribute to the development of an understanding of _ two - dimensional _ ( 2d ) turbulence @xcite in compressible quantum fluids . in the basic manifestation of 2d classical turbulence ( 2dct ) ,",

    "this is opposite to the dynamics of the familiar energy cascade of three - dimensional ( 3d ) turbulence in a classical fluid , in which large - scale flows continuously decay to smaller - scale flows that are eventually dissipated by viscous damping .",
    "inverse _ energy cascade of 2dct has been studied for decades and numerous excellent reviews exist on 2dct @xcite .      in order to study two - dimensional _ quantum _ turbulence ( 2dqt ) in a bec",
    ", one might envision subjecting the bec to continuous injection of energy and vorticity .",
    "dissipation of energy may also exist , perhaps by thermal damping that could induce vortices to exit the bec at its boundary , or perhaps due to vortex - antivortex annihilation .",
    "a balance between forcing and dissipation can be envisioned to lead to a statistically steady degree of turbulence in a bec .",
    "we might picture such a state as an approximately constant mean number of vortices in the bec , since enstrophy in a quantum fluid is proportional to the number of vortices @xcite . with the likelihood of future experimental methods for observing vortex dynamics and measuring energy spectra",
    ", we further imagine a scenario in which 2dqt can be experimentally and numerically studied , linked with new analytical approaches , and compared with 2dct phenomena .",
    "the prospects for the development of a new understanding of at least this one aspect of the exceptionally challenging topic of turbulence are tantalizing motivations for pursuit of 2dqt research .",
    "unfortunately there are a number of experimental challenges that must first be overcome .",
    "significantly , an isolated , trapped bec subjected to continuous injection of energy would eventually become depleted of atoms as the system rethermalized .",
    "it appears that a bec experimentalist s primary hope in this respect is to develop methods for studying 2dqt that are quasi - steady , where steady forcing and dissipation rates are balanced over finite timescales during which the bec is not significantly depleted of atoms .",
    "experimentally , the path to studying decaying 2dqt is perhaps much simpler , since this topic is more concerned with the dynamics of a bec after forcing has stopped .    while it should not be surprising that disordered vortex distributions in a highly oblate bec are relatively simple to obtain by a variety of experimental techniques ,",
    "as we discuss in this article , how best to obtain a quasi - steady state of forced 2dqt remains an open problem .",
    "we have begun to empirically tackle only the forcing aspect of this problem , although simulations are also beginning to address this issue @xcite .",
    "several of our methods for driving large numbers of vortices into highly oblate becs are described below .",
    "we generally associate these states with 2dqt in the sense that the disordered vortex distributions may be considered a 2d phenomenological equivalent of the vortex tangle that exists in 3d quantum turbulence .",
    "we do not provide any evidence that such disordered vortex distributions conform to particular kinetic energy spectra or display vortex dynamics that may be expected in fully developed 2dqt ; discussions of links between vortex distributions , vortex dynamics and aggregates , and kinetic energy spectra in bec 2dqt can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we also note that in the highly oblate trapping limit , bec confinement in one spatial direction is much stronger than the trapping in the two orthogonal directions .",
    "this limit is not strictly necessary for studying 2dqt , but vortex excitations in the form of kelvin waves are suppressed and vortices can be accurately approximated as having point - like dynamics in a plane within this limit @xcite .    in the following , we first describe some of the key phenomenological features of 2dct , and summarize only a few of the theoretical advances in 2dqt , some of which have been aimed at uncovering the similarities and differences between the classical and quantum systems .",
    "this article is not intended as a review of the state of theoretical understanding of 2dqt in becs ; for discussions of theoretical aspects of 2dqt we direct the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite and the references contained therein .",
    "the study of 2dqt , particularly in compressible quantum fluids such as becs , is still young and a full range of characteristics remains to be explored .",
    "our aim is to give an overview of the types of observations that may be desirable in 2dqt bec experiments , then to describe our experimental approach to creating and probing 2dqt in highly oblate becs .",
    "we present a range of tools available for exciting the bec using laser beams and magnetic fields .",
    "the bulk of the remainder of this article is devoted to describing various specific methods for driving vortices into a highly oblate bec , and we show example images of becs in such excited states .",
    "we conclude by briefly summarizing some of the open experimental challenges in generating and probing 2dqt in becs .      from a phenomenological standpoint , lesieur describes classical turbulence of continuum flows as having non - deterministic flow details , rapid mixing relative to molecular diffusion , and flow characteristics distributed among and interacting over a wide range of length scales @xcite ; see also sommeria s similar characterization of turbulence @xcite .",
    "such a description encompasses 2d turbulence , where flow dynamics vary primarily over two spatial coordinates ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) ; flow in a third direction ( @xmath2 ) may exist uniformly throughout the @xmath4-@xmath5 plane or there may be negligible flow along @xmath2 , hence a 3d fluid system may display 2d turbulence . building from this general description ,",
    "the further characteristics of 2d turbulence are markedly different from the characteristics of 3d turbulence .",
    "as noted earlier , one such difference is the direction of energy flux between length scales : in 2d flows , small - scale forcing can lead to the development of large - scale flows .      given their disordered and unpredictable nature , and challenges in discerning details of flow dynamics , turbulent flows are often characterized by the statistical properties of the system such as the kinetic energy density @xmath6 over wavenumber @xmath7 , which describes the distribution of kinetic energy among the length scales of the system . in 1967 , kraichnan @xcite found the existence of two inertial ranges associated with distinct kinetic energy spectra power laws , joined by the wavenumber associated with energy and enstrophy forcing .",
    "the first range extends from the forcing length scale to larger length scales ( or smaller wavenumbers ) , and displays a kinetic energy spectrum @xmath8 .",
    "this spectral distribution has the same form discovered by kolmogorov in 1941 @xcite in the context of 3d fluids , but in 2d this spectrum corresponds to an inverse energy cascade .",
    "the second range extends from the forcing scale to smaller length scales ( or larger wavenumbers ) and the kinetic energy spectrum approximately corresponds to @xmath9 .",
    "this two - component spectrum is a classic feature of 2d turbulence , and is further described in reviews of 2d turbulence  @xcite .",
    "physically the inverse energy cascade corresponds to the aggregation of vorticity such that small - scale forcing leads to the growth of large - scale vorticity until flows are of the order of the size of the system . at this scale dissipation of some form",
    "occurs , possibly due to frictional damping at the container s walls .",
    "prior to the development of 2d turbulence theory in the 1960s @xcite , onsager @xcite approached turbulent flow in 2d inviscid fluids by focusing on the dynamics of point - like centers of vorticity , or point vortices .",
    "a collection of point vortices may be constructed to approximately represent classical continuum flows , or may quite accurately describe vortex distributions in superfluids .",
    "in fact , in the same conference proceeding in which onsager described his theory of vortex states in 2d turbulent flows , he also first postulated the existence of quantized vorticity in superfluids , and implied that superfluids could be ideal testing grounds for his theoretical arguments of 2d turbulence @xcite .",
    "onsager argued that a system with a large number of vortices would maximize entropy when vortices of the same sense of circulation form aggregates , giving more room in a finite - volume phase space for the remainder of the vortex cores to distribute themselves and move with fewer constraints .",
    "onsager s predictions , which were the first hints of the existence of an inverse energy cascade , have yet to be directly confirmed experimentally in a superfluid .",
    "however , numerical simulations of 2dqt involving forcing in becs are indeed finding evidence for the existence of vortex aggregates that resemble onsager s predictions @xcite .      based on the above descriptions of 2d turbulence , direct experimental challenges for the study of 2d turbulence in quantum fluids",
    "include : ( i ) reaching a quasi - steady state of forced 2dqt ; ( ii ) observation of the aggregation of like - circulation quantized vortices in a superfluid in a state of forced 2dqt ; and ( iii ) direct measurement of the kinetic energy spectra associated with such turbulent states .",
    "these challenges all depend on the existence of means to generate 2dqt , so we now turn to the subject of vortices in highly oblate becs , and then focus on describing methods to nucleate large disordered distributions of vortices in these compressible quantum fluids .",
    "a dilute - gas bec is often adequately described in terms of an order parameter , or macroscopic wavefunction , of the form @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the atomic density distribution of the bec and @xmath12 is the quantum phase profile .",
    "the dynamics of the wavefunction @xmath13 are governed in the mean - field approximation by the gross - pitaevski equation ( gpe ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 characterizes the interaction strength between atoms , @xmath16 is the s - wave scattering length of interatomic interactions , @xmath17 is the atomic mass , and @xmath18 is the potential due to the trap and other external perturbations .    from a hydrodynamic perspective , a dilute - gas bec can behave as a tiny droplet of superfluid , where the local velocity of superfluid flow is proportional to the local gradient of the phase : @xmath19 consequently , the velocity field of a bec is irrotational , @xmath20 , except at singularities of the quantum phase @xmath21 .",
    "these singularities are the superfluid - free cores of the vortices , about which fluid circulation is quantized @xcite . a singly quantized vortex is associated with a 2@xmath22-phase winding about the core , and vortex positions and circulations",
    "can therefore be experimentally determined using atom interferometry techniques @xcite , or by sequential images that reveal the dynamics of the vortices @xcite .",
    "most single - shot images of becs , however , only reveal the location of the vortices and not their circulation .",
    "vortex cores in a bec have a diameter on the order of the healing length @xmath23 @xcite , which is typically sub - micron and much less than the wavelength of imaging light .",
    "release of the bec from the trap followed by ballistic expansion of the atom cloud enables the vortices to expand to diameters large enough to be optically resolvable , and this method is the standard approach to observing vortices in a bec . in a 3d trap , vortices may also bend with respect to the imaging axis @xcite , making them even more difficult to observe . in two dimensions",
    "however , these kelvin wave excitations are suppressed @xcite . as an example of the clarity that can be obtained in vortex detection , vortices in a highly oblate bec",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ vortexfig ] ; the vortices are the circular dark regions within the bec fluid , shown in grayscale with lightness of shade corresponding to integrated column density after ballistic expansion from the trap .",
    "in addition to isolated vortex cores , vortex dipoles may be found in highly oblate or 2d quantum fluids .",
    "these structures consist of two vortex cores of opposite circulation in close proximity .",
    "vortex aggregates , consisting of clusters of vortices of the same circulation , have also been experimentally observed in the form of multi - quantum vortex dipoles @xcite . in the context of 2dqt in a bec , however , to date only numerical simulations have observed vortex aggregates and their dynamics @xcite . in becs with a vector order parameter , other types of vortex structures",

    ", the gpe formalism can be formally linked to the navier - stokes equation that plays a key role in classical fluid dynamics @xcite . by incorporating into the gpe damping due to atomic scattering with thermal atoms ,",

    "@xcite for a discussion of the gpe  navier - stokes equation correspondence . given this correspondence",
    ", it should not be surprising that the concepts of turbulence may be investigated using becs and the variants of the gpe .    much like the vortex tangle that characterizes quantum turbulence in three dimensions @xcite",
    ", we would like to similarly physically characterize a state of 2dqt in a bec .",
    "we consider the simple picture of a disordered distribution of numerous vortex cores .",
    "such a distribution would satisfy the phenomenological criteria of turbulence stated earlier .",
    "first , a large disordered distribution of vortices would have non - deterministic and chaotic flow dynamics @xcite .",
    "second , numerical simulations have shown that such distributions can rapidly distribute vorticity @xcite or particles @xcite , even if these are initially concentrated in a small region , thereby satisfying the rapid mixing criterion of turbulence .",
    "finally , such a distribution of vortices can display a large range of inter - vortex separations with no characteristic length scale ; in contrast , a vortex lattice has a well - defined length scale of the spacing of the vortices in the lattice @xcite .",
    "we therefore interpret a disordered 2d distribution of numerous vortex cores as a phenomenological picture that corresponds to 2dqt .",
    "such a picture can be made more quantitative , for example by invoking the methodology and results of onsager @xcite or vortex position statistics , as has been investigated numerically @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , our general experimental goal is to create states that consist of many vortices distributed throughout highly oblate becs with no discernible or well - defined arrangement .",
    "as noted above , a primary factor distinguishing 2d and 3d turbulence is the suppression of significant flow dynamics in one spatial direction , relative to the flow dynamics in the plane normal to that direction . in the case of quantum turbulence",
    ", this corresponds to the suppression of kelvin waves @xcite .",
    "it may then be possible to study 2dqt in 3d becs , and it should be noted that quasi-2d becs @xcite or even highly oblate becs are not strictly needed for studies of 2dqt . on the other hand , even in highly oblate becs , vorticity can decay due to vortex - antivortex annihilation .",
    "it is therefore possible that enstrophy need not be conserved and that a direct energy cascade may appear , as has been recently noted in numerical simulations of decaying 2dqt @xcite . in a practical sense",
    "however , we expect that 2dqt is more readily achievable in highly oblate geometries .",

    "<S> bose - einstein condensates of dilute gases are well - suited for investigations of vortex dynamics and turbulence in quantum fluids , yet there has been little experimental research into the approaches that may be most promising for generating states of two - dimensional turbulence in these systems . here </S>",
    "<S> we give an overview of techniques for generating the large and disordered vortex distributions associated with two - dimensional quantum turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on describing methods explored in our bose - einstein condensation laboratory , and discuss the suitability of these methods for studying various aspects of two - dimensional quantum turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> we also summarize some of the open questions regarding our own understanding of these mechanisms of two - dimensional quantum turbulence generation in condensates . </S>",
    "<S> we find that while these disordered distributions of vortices can be generated by a variety of techniques , further investigation is needed to identify methods for obtaining quasi - steady - state quantum turbulence in condensates . </S>"
