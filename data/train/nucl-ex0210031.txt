    "two - particle intensity interferometry ( hbt ) is a useful tool to study the space - time geometry of the particle - emitting source in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "it also contains dynamical information that can be explored by studying the transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) dependence of the apparent source size @xcite . in non - central collisions information on the anisotropic shape of the pion - emitting region",
    "can be extracted by measuring two - pion correlation functions as a function of emission angle with respect the reaction plane @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present two - pion correlation systematics as a function of the collision energy , transverse mass ( @xmath1 ) , multiplicity , and emission angle with respect to the reaction plane in au+au collisions produced by the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory .",
    "we also present the first significant hbt measurement for neutral kaons from heavy ion collisions ; besides carrying important information about the dynamics of strange particles , these measurements provide valuable cross - checks on charged kaon hbt , as complication due to various corrections ( e.g. two - track efficiency and coulomb correction ) are quite different for neutral particles .    experimentally , two - particle correlations are studied by constructing the correlation function @xmath2(*q * )  =  a(*q*)/b(*q * ) . here",
    "a(*q * ) is the measured distribution of the momentum difference * q *  =  @xmath3  -  @xmath4 for pairs of particles from the same event , and b(*q * ) is the corresponding distribution for pairs of particles from different events .",
    "for this analysis we selected events with a collision vertex position within @xmath530  cm measured from the center of the 4  m long star time projection chamber ( tpc ) , and we mixed events only if their longitudinal primary vertex positions were no farther apart than 6  cm .",
    "we divided our sample into three centrality bins , where the centrality was characterized according to the measured multiplicity of charged particles at midrapidity .",
    "the three centrality bins correspond to 0 - 10@xmath6 ( central ) , 10 - 30@xmath6 ( midcentral ) , and 30 - 70@xmath6 ( peripheral ) of the total hadronic cross section .",
    "charged pions were identified by correlating their specific ionization in the gas of the tpc with their measured momentum .",
    "neutral kaons were identified via topological methods @xcite .    for charged pions , the effects of track - splitting ( reconstruction of a single track as two tracks ) and track - merging (",
    "two tracks with similar momenta reconstructed as a single track ) were eliminated as described in @xcite .",

    "the effect of the single - particle momentum resolution ( @xmath20p / p @xmath21 1@xmath6 for the particles under study ) induces systematic underestimation of the hbt parameters . using an iterative procedure @xcite , we corrected our correlation functions for finite resolution effects .",
    "the correction due to the uncertainty on the removal of the artificial reduction of the hbt parameters associated with the anti - merging cut is still being finalized ; we estimate systematic errors on hbt radii at about 1  fm .",
    "fig.[hbtparam ] shows the @xmath22 dependence of the source parameters for negative pions at three centrality bins .",
    "the three radii increase with increasing centrality and @xmath23 varies similarly to @xmath24 , @xmath25 ; for @xmath24 and @xmath25 this increase may be attributed to the geometrical overlap of the two nuclei .",
    "the extracted radii rapidly decrease as a function of @xmath22 , which is an indication of transverse flow @xcite ; interestingly the @xmath22 dependence is independent of centrality .    while slightly larger at 200 gev , the transverse homogeneity lengths are similar for both energies ( figs.[hbtparam ] ( a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "these results suggest a steeper fall - off with @xmath22 , which might indicate increased flow ; finalized corrections are necessary before drawing such conclusions .",

    "hbt radii are very similar to results reported at = 130 gev .",
    "our results indicate that both the evolution timescale ( as measured by the @xmath22 dependence of @xmath23 and the out - of - plane extended source indicated by the azimuthally - sensitive hbt ) and the emission duration ( probed by comparing @xmath24 to @xmath25 ) are surprisingly fast .",
    "the large acceptance and excellent tracking of the tpc has allowed for the first solid measurement of @xmath7-@xmath7 correlations . while still preliminary , these suggest a surprisingly large homogeneity length at high @xmath22 .",
