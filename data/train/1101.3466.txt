    "the large amount of experimental data collected at rhic during the last decade , and at the lhc during the last year , allows to explore novel qcd effects .",
    "in particular , rhic measurements present a number of features which can be consistently interpreted as consequences of a large gluon density in the gold nucleus , and of the corresponding non - linear qcd dynamics .",
    "manifestations of this so - called saturation regime of qcd include the suppression of forward particle production @xcite and the azimuthal de - correlation of forward hadron pairs @xcite in d+au compared to p+p collisions .",
    "the recent start of the lhc significantly enhances the possibilities to explore the saturation regime of qcd already in p+p collisions , as shown by the recent observation of long - range rapidity correlations in high - multiplicity events @xcite .",
    "we argue below that these data are well described by the effective theory called the color glass condensate ( cgc ) , the best approximation of qcd devised so far to quantify parton saturation ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it properly takes into account both the non - linear evolution of hadronic / nuclear wave functions , and multiple parton interactions in scattering processes .",
    "such effects are relevant when the gluon densities involved are large enough , corresponding to partons with a small - enough energy fraction @xmath0 , and the cgc describes reliably only that small-@xmath0 part of the hadronic / nuclear wave function . and",
    "although the cgc describes non - linear qcd dynamics , it is still a weakly - coupled theory .    in p+a collisions ,",
    "the saturation regime is better studied with forward particle production , sensitive only to large - x partons on the proton side , but mainly to small-@xmath0 gluons on the nucleus side .",
    "since the large-@xmath0 part of a proton wave function is well understood in perturbative qcd , this allows to investigate the small-@xmath0 part of the nucleus wave function . in a+a and high - multiplicity p+p collisions",
    ", the dynamics of small-@xmath0 gluons can be studied using long - range rapidity correlations , sensitive to the early times after the collision rather than the following complicated space - time evolution of the system .",
    "while the existence of the qcd saturation regime is , at a theoretical level , clear , the real challenge from a phenomenological point of view has been to assess to what extent it is relevant at present energies . such was a difficult task , since different aspect of the parton dynamics may concur in data , and also because the limit of asymptotically high energy in which the cgc formalism is developed is not fully realized in current experiments .",
    "nevertheless , this has been achieved with the successful simultaneous description of the suppression of particle production @xcite and azimuthal correlations @xcite at forward rapidities in d+au compared to p+p collisions , using the most up - to - date theoretical tools available in the cgc approach .",
    "this is explained in section [ monojets ] , in parallel with more standard mechanisms that successfully describe particle production at mid - rapidity . in section [ ridge ] , we discuss long - range rapidity correlations in high - multiplicity p+p and au+au collisions , and argue that the angular structure seen in the data and called the ridge may be interpreted as a consequence of large parton densities @xcite , albeit in these cases several other possible interpretations exist .",
    "in the case of double - inclusive hadron production @xmath1 , the partons in the proton ( nucleus ) wave function that can contribute to the cross section carry a fraction of longitudinal momentum bounded from below by @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , with @xmath4 where @xmath5 @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xmath8 denote the transverse momenta and rapidities of the final - state particles , and @xmath9 the collision energy per nucleon .",
    "one can distinguish three interesting situations , where different qcd dynamics is at play .",
    "first , the production of high-@xmath10 di - jets , initiated by large-@xmath0 partons and kinematically bound to be produced at mid - rapidity .",
    "second , the production of low-@xmath10 di - hadrons at mid - rapidity , sensitive to power corrections and values of @xmath0 still moderately large .",
    "note that moving one of the hadrons to forward rapidities ( central - forward case ) increases significantly the value of @xmath2 compared to the central - central case ( for which @xmath11 ) , but decreases @xmath3 only marginally ; for this reason we shall refer to these two situations as mid - rapidity ones .",
    "finally , the production of di - hadrons at forward rapidities ( forward - forward case ) is sensitive to power corrections in the small-@xmath0 regime , i.e. to saturation .",
    "only the forward - forward case is sensitive to values of @xmath3 as small as in the single - inclusive forward hadron production case : @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",

    "[ dijets ] shows the cross section for high-@xmath10 di - jets in p+p collisions at the tevatron , as the function of the azimuthal angle between the jets @xmath14 @xcite .",

    "the coincidence probability features a near - side peak around @xmath21 when both measured particles belong to the same mini - jet , and an away - side peak around @xmath22 corresponding to hadrons produced back - to - back . in the central - forward case , there is naturally no near - side peak . either in p+p or d+au collisions , the sizable width of the away - side peak can not be described within the leading - twist collinear factorization framework .",
    "this indicates that power corrections are important when @xmath23 gev . at such low transverse momenta ,",
    "collinear factorization does not provide a global picture of particle production at rhic , even at mid - rapidity .",
    "there are two main formalisms to take into account power corrections to the leading - twist approximation , the glauber - eikonal approach , and the cgc framework .",
    "the former relies on a resummation of incoherent multiple scatterings , and therefore is not applicable at small @xmath0 , where multiple scatterings are coherent .",
    "performing the complete resummation including energy - momentum conservation is a challenging task , and more often than not a detour to the strict calculation is taken by introducing non - perturbative parameters such as the so - called intrinsic transverse momentum . by contrast , the cgc is valid only in the small-@xmath0 limit .",
    "coherent multiple scatterings are taken into account along with the equally important non - linear parton evolution , since both parametrically contribute to the same level when a large gluon density is reached , and including one without the other is not consistent . in both frameworks ,",
    "the multiple scatterings induce a @xmath10-broadening , characterized either by a non - perturbative scale at large @xmath0 , or by the saturation scale at small @xmath0 , as explained in the next section .",
    "both the glauber - eikonal @xcite and cgc @xcite approaches qualitatively describe the di - hadron azimuthal correlation data at mid - rapidity , including the broad width of the away - side peak and its depletion in d+au collisions when going from central - central to central - forward production .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fwd - cent ] , left and center plots .",
    "such a depletion does not occur in p+p collisions , it is due to nuclear - enhanced power corrections , and the p+a to p+p ratio of the integrated coincidence probabilities @xmath24 is therefore below unity . in fig .",
    "[ fwd - cent ] , right plot , recent phenix data on @xmath16 @xcite are displayed as a function of centrality .    at the moment",
    ", it is not clear whether the physical origin of the @xmath10-broadening and of the azimuthal de - correlation is parton saturation rather than incoherent multiple scatterings .",
    "this is probably due to the kinematic window probed in these measurements : for a hadron momentum of @xmath23 gev , one is sensitive to @xmath25 to 0.1 at rhic energies . in this regime",
    "different physical mechanisms may concur , and neither underlying assumption of the two different descriptions is completely fulfilled .",

    "particle production in the forward - rapidity region offers a cleaner opportunity .",
    "this was realized in @xcite , where the importance of the forward di - hadron measurement was emphasized , and predictions of the azimuthal angle distribution were made .",
    "although these results were only qualitative since for instance parton fragmentation was not included , they have been confirmed by subsequent rhic measurements .",

    "[ starcp ] , for both p+p ( left plot ) and central d+au ( center plot ) collisions .",

    "let us outline this calculation .",
    "as external probes propagate through a target hadron or nucleus , their multiple scatterings off the small - x gluons is coherent because the wavelength of these gluons increases with decreasing x , eventually becoming bigger than the longitudinal extent of the target .",
    "the momentum scale below which such coherent multiple scattering are important is the saturation scale @xmath26 , the same scale which characterizes the onset of non - linear effects in the hadronic / nuclear wave function .",
    "both are taken into account in the cgc approach , which resums all power corrections that are dominant in the small-@xmath0 limit .",
    "non - linear parton evolution generates an intrinsic transverse momentum while some is also gained through multiple scatterings . the magnitude of both is controlled by @xmath27 , which is an increasing function with decreasing @xmath0 .    in the leading-@xmath28 approximation",
    ", the evolution of the saturation scale with @xmath0 , and more generally of the cgc wave function , can obtained from a functional renormalization group equation . in the large-@xmath29 limit",
    ", it reduces to the non - linear balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation @xcite .",
    "the recent determination of running coupling corrections to the original leading - logarithmic equation @xcite has proven an essential step in promoting the bk equation to a phenomenological tool .",
    "indeed , the derivation of the rcbk equation , along with numerical simulations @xcite , made robust quantitative calculations possible .",
    "for instance , after the two parameters of the theory were constrained by single - inclusive forward hadron production @xcite ( they are @xmath30 , the value of @xmath3 below which one starts to trust , and therefore use , the cgc framework , and the value of the saturation scale at the starting point of the evolution @xmath31 ) , parameter - free predictions for the coincidence probability @xmath32 could be made @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ starcp ] , right plot , these predictions are compared with the star data .",
    "we see that the disappearance of the away - side peak in central d+au collisions , compared to p+p collisions , is quantitatively consistent with the cgc calculations .",
    "these are only robust in the d+au case ( for which @xmath33 gev@xmath34 ) , but the extrapolation to the p+p case ( for which @xmath35 gev@xmath34 is uncomfortably close to @xmath36 ) is displayed in order to show that it is qualitatively consistent with the presence an the away - side peak . since uncorrelated background has not been extracted from the data , the overall normalization of the data points has been adjusted by subtracting a constant shift , as indicated on the figure .",
    "we recall that di - hadron correlations at mid - rapidity , which are sensitive to larger values of @xmath3 , feature an away - side peak in both p+p and central d+au collisions .",
    "the fact that the away - side peak disappears in the central d+au case , when going from central to forward rapidities , indicates that the effect is correlated with the growth of the nuclear gluon density with decreasing @xmath3 .",
    "similarly , we predict that in the forward - forward case , the away - side peak reappears when going from central to peripheral collisions , or for higher transverse momenta of the measured particles .",
    "we are not aware of any descriptions of this phenomena that do not invoke saturation effects .",
    "we note that another successful description based on the kln saturation model was also proposed @xcite . there",
    ", although different assumptions are used , the existence of the saturation scale is the crucial ingredient to successfully reproduce the data",
    ".    while more differential measurements of the coincidence probability , as a function of transverse momentum , rapidity or centrality , will provide further quantitative tests of the cgc , this piece of evidence strongly indicates that we have observed manifestations of the saturation regime of qcd at rhic .",
    "however , there are still progresses to be made on the theoretical side . for instance",
    ", an approximation was used in @xcite , in order to express the double - inclusive hadron production cross section ( also derived in @xcite and in @xcite with in addition gluon - initiated di - jets ) in terms of only the single - gluon distribution function , already well constrained .",
    "the validity of this approximation has been critically examined @xcite , as it does not allow to correctly implement the non - linear qcd evolution , even in the large @xmath29 limit . still , in practice",
    ", no better solution has been proposed so far .",
    "this will require to numerically solve the @xmath0 evolution of multi - gluon distributions , which implies to introduce additional parameters to characterize the corresponding initial conditions .",
    "it was pointed out recently that in the limit of small di - hadron momentum imbalance , only single - gluon distributions are needed @xcite , but in general this is not the case .",
    "let us now discuss high - multiplicity p+p and heavy - ion collisions . when considering low-@xmath10 particle production , only the small-@xmath0 part of the wave functions of the colliding objects is relevant , and therefore such collisions can be described by the scattering of two cgcs .",
    "the system created immediately after such a collision is called the glasma , it provides a weak - coupling description of the early stages after a high - multiplicity p+p or a+a collision , before evolving into a thermalized quark - gluon plasma it the system size is big enough , as is the case for not - too - peripheral heavy - ion collisions .",
    "if we denote @xmath37 and @xmath38 the strong color charges of the incoming hadrons / nuclei , the color field describing the dynamics of the small - x gluons is solution of the yang - mills equations @xmath39=\\delta^{+\\nu}\\rho_1+\\delta^{-\\nu}\\rho_2\\ .\\ ] ] the glasma field , after the collision , is non - trivial @xcite : it has a strong component ( @xmath40 ) , a component which is particle like ( @xmath41 ) , and components of any strength in between . to understand how this pre - equilibrium system thermalizes",
    ", one needs to understand how the glasma field decays into particles .",
    "right after the collision , the strong field component contains all modes .",
    "then , as the field decays , modes with @xmath42 are not part of the strong component anymore , and for those a particle description becomes more appropriate . after a time of order @xmath43 , this picture breaks down , and it has been a formidable challenge to determine weather a fast thermalization can be achieved within this framework .    a problem which can be addressed more easily is particle production . as discussed below , a factorization framework has been established to perform such calculations @xcite .",
    "before we outline it , let us point out that two - particle correlations are especially interesting , because they can probe the dynamics of the early times after the collision , if the rapidity difference between the two final - state particles is large enough @xcite .",
    "indeed , causality imposes that particles separated by a rapidity @xmath44 can be correlated only by events which happened at @xmath45 where the freeze - out time @xmath46 denotes the time of last interaction .",
    "this is explained in fig .",
    "[ glasma ] , left diagram , which shows the space - time picture of the collision : in the forward light - cone , lines of constant proper time @xmath47 are hyperbolae and lines of constant rapidity @xmath48 are straight lines from the origin .",
    "therefore , while heavy - ion collisions are in general not great probes of parton saturation due to the complicated space - time evolution of the system , long - range di - hadron correlations are particularly well - suited observables for that purpose .     are being probed in the nuclear wave functions.,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]   are being probed in the nuclear wave functions.,title=\"fig:\",width=245 ]      to compute particle production in the collision of two cgcs , the first task is to express the cross sections in terms of the glasma field @xmath49 $ ] , taking into account multiple partonic interactions , as pictured in fig .",

    "for instance , in the case of single - inclusive gluon production , the cross section reads @xmath58=\\frac{1}{16\\pi^3}\\int d^4x d^4y\\ e^{ip\\cdot(x - y)}\\ \\box_x\\box_y \\sum_\\lambda \\epsilon_\\lambda^\\mu(p ) \\epsilon_\\lambda^\\nu(p)\\ a_\\mu(x)a_\\nu(y)\\ .\\ ] ]    an aspect of hadronic collisions which happens to be much simpler when large parton densities are involved , compared to small ones , is multi - gluon production .",
    "indeed , in a collision of dilute objects of small partonic densities , the produced gluons predominantly all come from the same ladder , because this is what involves the parton distributions a minimum number of times ( once for each colliding hadron ) .",
    "by contrast , in a collision of dense objects , the dominant contribution comes about when the produced gluons all originate from different ladders , so as to involve both gluon distributions a maximum number of times ( a pair for each produced gluon ) .",
    "the multi - gluon production cross section then reads : @xmath59=\\frac{dn}{d^3p_1}[a_\\mu]\\times\\dots\\times\\frac{dn}{d^3p_n}[a_\\mu]\\ .\\ ] ] this power counting argument that qualitatively distinguishes multi - particle production in high - multiplicity p+p and a+a collisions compared to minimum - bias p+p collisions , also applies when @xmath44 is large .    in the leading-@xmath28 approximation ,",
    "the evolution of @xmath60 $ ] with decreasing @xmath0 is given by a functional renormalization group equation .",
    "as both the cgc wave function @xmath56 and the glasma field @xmath61 first have to be evaluated numerically , performing the @xmath62 integrations while fully implementing the non - linear qcd evolution has proven to be an extremely challenging task , and has not been achieved yet . in phenomenological studies of two - particle correlations , it is instead assumed that @xmath60 $ ] is a gaussian distribution , whose variance is evolving with @xmath0 such that the evolution of the single - gluon distribution is correctly reproduced ( but that of multi - gluon distributions is not ) . in this case , the double - inclusive hadron production cross section can be expressed in terms of only single - gluon distributions @xcite , allowing a practical phenomenological analysis .",
    "however , similarly to what was mentioned at the end of section [ monojets ] , this approximation does not correctly implement the non - linear qcd evolution , as it misses a large number of leading-@xmath29 contributions @xcite .",
