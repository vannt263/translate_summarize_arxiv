    "millisecond pulsars have been a subject of active interest ever since the discovery of psr 1937 + 21 by backer et al .",
    "it is generally accepted that the neutron stars in these systems have been spun up by accretion torques in binary systems ( e.g. , alpar et al .",
    "1984 ; phinney & kulkarni 1994 ) .",
    "this class of rotation powered pulsars can remain active for as long as a hubble timescale , offering the opportunity for investigating the emission processes of old recycled neutron stars",
    ". of interest in recent years have been studies of the x - ray properties of these objects . specifically , pioneering studies carried out by becker & trmper ( 1999 ) using rosat led to the detection of 9 millisecond pulsars in the energy band from 0.1 - 2.4 kev .",
    "since little x - ray emission is expected from the cooling of the neutron star , due to the millisecond pulsars long age ( e.g. , tsuruta 1998 ) , investigators have primarily focused on emission processes taking place in the magnetosphere ( e.g. , cheng & ruderman 1980 ; arons 1981 ; zhang & harding 2000 ; harding & muslimov 2001 , 2002 ; zhang & cheng 2003 ) .",
    "however , it has long been recognized that the nebulae surrounding young pulsars are important for understanding the nature and spatial extent of the non - thermal x - ray emission of these compact objects after x - ray detections of the crab nebula ( peterson & jacobson 1970 and references therein ) . in particular , the recent x - ray images of young pulsars obtained with the _ chandra _ observatory have revealed spatially resolved structures , which provide important diagnostic information about the geometry of the inner regions of the crab supernova remnant ( weisskopf et al .",
    "2000 ) and vela nebula ( helfand , gotthelf , & halpern 2001 ) .",
    "such extended structures are not limited to young pulsars as they have also been observed from the three million year old pulsar psr 1929 + 10 ( becker et al .",
    "2005 ) and from the old binary millisecond pulsar psr 1957 + 20 ( stappers et al .",
    "the information gleaned from these observational studies is vital for facilitating an understanding of the mechanism involved in the production of the x - ray emission . for the majority of pulsars , where the nebulae are unresolved",
    ", the wind nebulae would contribute to the non - thermal non - pulsed x - ray emission component ( see kennel & coroniti 1984 ; chevalier 2000 ) .",
    "recently , cheng , taam , & wang ( 2004 ) have found that the x - ray properties of the non - thermal non - pulsed emission component of all known rotation powered x - ray pulsars could be interpreted within such a framework whether or not a wind nebula has been identified with the pulsar .    in this paper",
    ", we build on the seminal study of the x - ray emission properties of millisecond pulsars elucidated in becker & trmper ( 1999 ) to examine the properties of the non - thermal non - pulsed component from recycled neutron stars .",
    "the origin of the x - ray emission from these objects may be on the neutron star surface , in the magnetosphere , and in the wind nebula .",
    "since different radiation processes are involved in these spatially distinct regions , it is likely that their contribution to the total luminosity and energy spectra differ .",
    "cheng et al .",
    "( 2004 ) argue that the main contribution to the non - thermal non - pulsed component in pulsars is due to the emission from the wind nebula . in this paper , we assume this to be the case as well , although one can not exclude magnetospheric contributions at luminosity levels lower than @xmath0 of the spin down power .",
    "our interest in the x - ray emission of millisecond pulsars has been further stimulated by the recent detection of faint x - ray point sources with luminosities in the range from @xmath1 ergs s@xmath2 in deep observational surveys of the galactic center by wang , gotthelf , & lang ( 2002 ) and muno et al .",
    "the spectra of the galactic center sources in the innermost 20 pc have been fitted to a power law of photon index , @xmath3 , ranging from about -1 to 3 ( muno et al . 2003 ) .",
    "muno et al .",
    "( 2004 ) suggest that magnetic cataclysmic variables can substantially contribute to the faint population characterized by hard spectra . on the other hand , these binary systems do not significantly contribute to the fainter x - ray population characterized by softer spectra .",
    "belczynski & taam ( 2004 ) suggest that among neutron star models , the neutron stars in the quiescent state of soft x - ray transients in roche lobe overflow systems can contribute to the faint ( @xmath4 ergs s@xmath2 ) , soft sources detected in the muno et al .",
    "( 2003 ) survey .",
    "the millisecond pulsars , which are likely descendants of such systems , may contribute more significantly to the general population of such sources in the galaxy because of their long lifetimes .",
    "estimates of the number of millisecond pulsars in the galaxy exceeds @xmath5 ( lyne et al .",
    "1998 ) .    here , we explore millisecond pulsars as a possible class of compact objects contributing to the faint x - ray source population in the galaxy . in the next section ,",
    "the x - ray data on millisecond pulsars is collected , illustrating the observational correlations of their x - ray properties .",
    "the theoretical basis for these correlations are described in  3 within the framework of a simple model , based on the work by chevalier ( 2000 ) for the wind nebulae surrounding young pulsars .",
    "in addition , the emission from an intrabinary shock for the case in which the relativistic pulsar wind interacts with a companion star is also discussed . in  4 , the model is applied to the millisecond pulsar b 1957 + 20 and is used to estimate the pulsar wind contribution to the non - pulsed x - ray luminosity in the millisecond pulsars b1937 + 21 and j 0218 + 4232 .",
    "we also discuss the possible relevance of the emission from the wind nebulae and surrounding environment of millisecond pulsars in the soft x - ray transient sax j1808.4 - 3658 , the galactic center , and in the globular clusters 47 tuc and m28 .",
    "finally , we summarize and discuss the implications of the results of our study in the last section .",
    "the rosat results from the early studies of becker & trmper ( 1993 , 1999 ) suggested that the x - ray radiation from millisecond pulsars is composed of non - thermal and thermal components .",
    "the thermal emission was attributed to the heated polar caps and the non - pulsed non - thermal emission to a pulsar wind or a plerion ( becker & trmper 1993 ) .",
    "observations with the asca satellite at energies higher than those accessible by the rosat satellite have also revealed the presence of x - ray pulses ( saito et al .",
    "more recently , mineo et al . ( 2000 ) and becker & aschenbach ( 2002 ) detected both the pulsed and non - pulsed non - thermal emission components of additional millisecond pulsars based on _ bepposax , chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations . direct evidence of the spatial x - ray distribution",
    "was provided by stappers et al .",
    "( 2003 ) in their important discovery of the nebula surrounding psr b1957 + 20 .    in table 1 , the luminosities and spectral properties of 8 millisecond pulsars in the galactic field are collected from recent observations based on x - ray data obtained from the _ asca , rxte , bepposax , chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ satellites . for 2 of these pulsars ,",
    "the pulsed and/or non - pulsed emission components were separately analyzed .",
    "as in our previous study ( cheng , taam , & wang 2004 ) , we assume that the pulsed component arises from the pulsar magnetosphere and that the non - thermal non - pulsed component is due to a pulsar wind nebula .    the relation between the total x - ray luminosity and the spin down power of the 8 millisecond pulsars , as obtained from the literature ,",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . a correlation between the total x - ray luminosity in the energy range of 2 - 10 kev , @xmath6 , and the spin down power , @xmath7 ,",
    "is seen to be present , and it is described by the best fit function @xmath8 ergs s@xmath2 , where we have approximated the errors in log(@xmath9 ) to be @xmath10 0.2 .",
    "this relation was first discovered by seward & wang ( 1988 ) with einstein data and others have also found similar correlations of normal and millisecond pulsars taken together ( e.g. @xmath11gelman 1995 ; saito 1998 ; cheng , taam & wang 2004 ) .",
    "becker & trmper ( 1997 ) , using rosat data in the energy range of 0.1 - 2.4 kev , found a slightly different relation ( @xmath12 ) . in the energy range analyzed by becker & trmper ( 1997 ) ,",
    "the thermal component , which is expected to be emitted from the neutron star surface , can play a significant role . on the other hand",
    ", the thermal component should not significantly contribute in our selected energy range ( 2 - 10 kev ) .",
    "this suggests that there could be another component contributing to the harder x - rays .",
    "cheng , taam & wang ( 2004 ) have used the asca data of both normal and millisecond pulsars to analyze the relations between the @xmath7 and the total x - ray luminosity , pulsed x - ray luminosity ( @xmath13 ) , and non - pulsed x - ray luminosity ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the relations between @xmath15 and @xmath16 are found to be very similar , whereas the relation between @xmath17 is similar to the relation obtained by becker & trmper ( 1997 ) .",
    "it was shown that the latter relation results from magnetospheric radiation , but that the non - pulsed radiation likely originates from the pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) .",
    "since asca has a large collection area , which should cover the pulsar wind shock radiation region , a significant fraction of the total luminosity could be contributed by the pwn .",
    "although we do not have a sufficient number of millisecond pulsars to carry out the non - pulsed x - ray luminosity analysis , we hypothesize that the pulsar wind nebula is a significant contributor to the total luminosity in 2 - 10 kev range .",
    "the measured photon power law indices , @xmath3 , of the total x - ray emission are found in the range from @xmath18 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "for the millisecond pulsars in which the photon index of the pulsed and non - pulsed components were determined , it appears that the spectral indices of their non - pulsed emission range from 3.3 for b1937 + 21 to 1.17 for j0218 + 4232 .",
    "the x - ray emission from a pulsar can arise from various processes on the neutron star surface or in its vicinity .",
    "for example , thermal processes can occur on its surface and polar cap regions , synchrotron emission processes within its magnetosphere and synchrotron processes in the shocked region resulting from the interaction of a relativistic wind with a binary companion to the pulsar or the surrounding interstellar medium .",
    "it should be pointed out that curvature radiation and the inverse compton processes can also contribute to the radiation from the pulsar magnetosphere and pulsar wind nebula .",
    "however , these two processes can only generate @xmath19-rays .",
    "for example , in the case of the intrabinary shock , it has been shown that although the inverse compton scattering can be the dominant cooling process , it will produce a maxwellian spectrum with a peak energy at several tens of gev ( tavani , arons & kaspi 1994 ; tavani & arons 1997 ) . in this paper",
    "we focus on the x - ray emission , and , therefore we will ignore these two processes . in the following ,",
    "we discuss the various emission processes in turn .      as thermal x - ray emission from the entire neutron star surface",
    "is not expected to be appreciable due to the age of the pulsar , the thermal x - ray emission from the neutron star surface is likely to be limited to a polar cap region . for simplicity , we assume that the thermal x - ray luminosity is given as @xmath20 . here ,",
    "@xmath21 ( goldreich & julian 1969 ) , and @xmath22 is the potential of the polar gap .",
    "jones ( 1980 ) showed that the photoejection of the most tightly bound electrons of ions can limit the potential of the polar gap to @xmath23 v where @xmath24 and @xmath19 is the lorentz factor of ions .",
    "cheng & taam ( 2003 ) argue that if higher order magnetic fields are present on the surface of neutron star @xmath25 . for the typical parameters of millisecond pulsars in the galaxy ( e.g. @xmath26 ms , @xmath27 g ) , @xmath28 .",
    "in contrast to the thermal processes taking place on the neutron star surface , non - thermal x - rays can be produced in its immediate vicinity as a result of synchrotron emission of electron - positron pairs produced by an electromagnetic cascade near the neutron star surface ( see cheng , gil & zhang 1998 ; cheng & zhang 1999 ; zhang & cheng 2003 ) .",
    "the model predicts a luminosity @xmath29 ( cheng & zhang 1999 ) .",
    "the conversion efficiency of spin down power to photon luminosity in the energy range from 0.1 kev to 1 mev is @xmath30 .",
    "the non - thermal x - ray radiation can also be produced as a result of synchrotron emission processes in a region affected by the interaction of the pulsar s relativistic wind with the interstellar medium .",
    "the resulting interaction can take the form of a termination shock .",
    "a detailed description of the interaction between a pulsar and its nebula , as applied to the crab nebula , was first outlined in a seminal paper by rees and gunn ( 1974 ) .",
    "theoretical studies on the x - ray emission from pwn have remained as an important topic due to the increased quality of observed data .",
    "blondin , chevalier & frierson ( 2001 ) have used one- and two - dimensional two fluid models to simulate the pwn in evolved young supernova remnants .",
    "this model can explain some chaotic and asymmetric appearances of young pwn such as the vela nebula . bucciantini ( 2002 ) has used a 2d hydrodynamic model to estimate the opacity of the bow - shock to penetration of ism neutral hydrogen , which can significantly affect the size , shape , velocity and brightness distribution of the nebula .",
    "a magnetohydrodynamical model was developed by van der swaluw ( 2003 ) to simulate the expansion of pwn , showing that the pwn is elongated as a result of the dynamical effect of toroidal magnetic fields .",
    "finally , komissarov & lyubarksi ( 2003 ) have used a 2d relativistic magnetohydrodynamical model to simulate the peculier jet - torus structure of the crab nebula .",
    "for a recent discussion of the emission characteristics of the shocked region , see cheng et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . in this subsection",
    ", we will use a simple spherically symmetric ( 1d ) model similar to that suggested by chevalier ( 2000 ) to estimate the non - thermal radiation from the pwn of msp . in general , 2d or 3d models are necessary to provide a detailed theoretical explanation of the emission morphology from young pulsars ( gaensler 2004 ) .",
    "however , the proper motion of msps are typically much slower than canonical high magnetic field pulsars .",
    "the pwn of msp may be older and expanding more slowly ( subsonically ) .",
    "furthermore , we can estimate the distance from the neutron star where the charged particles in the pulsar wind can break away from the pulsar magnetic field by requiring that the larmor radius of the particle becomes larger than the curvature radius of the magnetic field .",
    "this requirement leads to a break away radius at @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the surface magnetic field , @xmath33 is the stellar radius and @xmath34 is the mean energy of the charged particle in the wind .",
    "although the toroidal magnetic fields of young pulsars in pwn could indeed have a dynamical influence on its structure , making the nebula elongated ( e.g. van der swaluw 2003 ) , the magnetic field strengths of msps are much weaker and may not be as effective . from the above estimate , we can see that this is true if the mean lorentz factor in the pulsar is a constant .",
    "cheng , taam and wang ( 2004 ) have argued that the relation between the x - ray luminosity and the pulsar spin - down power ( @xmath35 ) can be obtained if @xmath36 . since @xmath37 , then @xmath38 , providing additional evidence that the nebula of msp is not as elongated as in the young pulsars .",
    "consequently , the bow shock created by msp may be well approximated by a 1d model .",
    "for isolated millisecond pulsars , the radius of the bow shock ( which is expected to be comparable to the size of the x - ray emitting region ) produced by the interaction of the pulsar wind with the interstellar medium is obtained from a pressure balance condition , leading to r_s = ( e/2v_p^2 c)^1/2~1.810 ^ 16e_34 ^ 1/2n^-1/2v_p,100 ^ -1 cm , where @xmath39 is the pulsar velocity in units of 100 km s@xmath2 , @xmath40 is the spin down power of the pulsar in units of @xmath41 ergs s@xmath2 , and @xmath42 is the number density of the interstellar medium in units of 1 @xmath43 .",
    "we point out that the size of pwn is energy dependent since the cooling time in x - rays is shorter than in the radio regime .",
    "since it is very likely that the synchrotron cooling time in x - ray energy range is shorter than the flow time in the shock region , the x - ray pwn can be approximated by equation 1 .",
    "on the other hand , the tev pwn should be larger than that of x - ray pwn because when the relativistic electrons leave the shock region ( while radiating at lower frequencies ) , they contribute to the tev photon production via the inverse compton scattering process .    in the shock wave , the energy can be stored in the proton ( ion ) , electron , and magnetic field components .",
    "the fractional energy densities @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 correspond to that of the protons , electrons , and magnetic field respectively .",
    "we note that the protons do not contribute to the x - ray emission through the synchrotron process .",
    "the energy densities in the shock are not theoretically determined with any certainty , however , kennel & coroniti ( 1984 ) have argued that only for ratios of magnetic to kinetic energy , defined as @xmath47 , less than about 0.1 can a significant fraction of total energy flux upstream be converted into thermal energy downstream and , thereafter , into synchrotron luminosity . in fitting to the observational data of the crab nebula , kennel & coroniti ( 1984 ) found that @xmath48 should lie in the range between 0.001 and 0.01 .",
    "dejager & harding ( 1992 ) have found that @xmath49 gives the best fit for the egret and tev data from the crab nebula .",
    "recently , sefako & dejager ( 2003 ) have found that the broadband spectrum of a pwn crucially depends on the magnetization parameter , spin - down power , distance , particle multiplicity and shock radius . in order to fit the broadband spectrum of the vela pulsar and psr b1706 - 44",
    ", the best fit value of @xmath50 was found for these pulsars , both of which have very similar ages ( @xmath51years ) .",
    "this value is substantially different from that of the crab nebula .",
    "since the crab nebula has been observed and theoretically studied more than any other pulsar wind nebula , we adopt @xmath48=0.003 as the standard reference value , but we also consider other possible value of @xmath48 .",
    "in addition , we also assume comparable particle kinetic energy fractions ( e.g , @xmath44 and @xmath52 ) throughout this study .",
    "thus , the magnetic field in the emitting region can be estimated as b = ( 6_b e / r_s^2 c)^1/2~510 ^ -6 ( _ b/0.003)^1/2n^1/2 v_p,100 g.    following the analysis of chevalier ( 2000 , see also cheng et al .",
    "2004 ) , the x - ray properties of the pulsar wind can be theoretically calculated .",
    "in particular , we take the postshock electron energy distribution for a strong relativistic shock as @xmath53 for @xmath54 , where @xmath55 , and @xmath56 is the lorentz factor of the relativistic pulsar wind , which is assumed to be @xmath57 throughout this study .",
    "the determination of the x - ray luminosity is dependent on the cooling frequency , @xmath58 , given as @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is a characteristic timescale of the nebula estimated as the flow timescale in a characteristic radiation region , i.e , @xmath61 . for @xmath62 (",
    "denoted as fast cooling ) , the observed luminosity of radiating particles per unit frequency is given as ( chevalier 2000 ) @xmath63 r_s^ -(p-2)/2e^(p+2)/4 ^ -p/2 .",
    "here , we estimate the total x - ray luminosity as @xmath64 for simplicity .",
    "taking typical parameters for millisecond pulsars ( @xmath26 ms , @xmath65 g ,",
    "@xmath66 ergs s@xmath2 , @xmath67 km s@xmath2 and @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 ( we take the possible optimum value based on theoretical investigations of highly relativistic shock fronts in the limit of high lorentz factors , see bednarz & ostrowski 1998 , lemoine & pelletier 2003 ) , the x - ray luminosity ( @xmath71hz ) is @xmath72 . in order to explain the observed relation between the x - ray luminosity and the spin - down power , we ( cheng , taam & wang 2004 ) have argued that @xmath73 . for @xmath74 and @xmath75 , @xmath64 will decrease slightly to @xmath76 .",
    "if we decrease @xmath77 to slightly larger values than @xmath782 , the luminosity reaches a level of @xmath79 . in this regime",
    ", the efficiency of conversion of spin down power to x - ray luminosity can be as high as @xmath80 , a value which is much greater than that associated with the pulsed emission from the magnetosphere ( cf .",
    "as is well known , the photon index in the fast cooling regime is given by @xmath81 .",
    "generally , @xmath77 can vary from 2 to 3 , and the pulsar wind nebulae could produce non - thermal spectra with photon indices in the range from 2 to 2.5 . on the other hand , if the cooling frequency is larger than the frequency @xmath82 ( denoted as slow cooling ) , the observed luminosity per frequency @xmath83 . in this regime , the x - ray luminosity will be lower than that in the fast cooling regime , and the observed photon index is @xmath84 ( chevalier 2000 ) . in this case , the pulsar wind nebulae could produce non - thermal spectra with photon indices ranging between 1.5 and 2 , corresponding to conversion efficiencies ranging from about @xmath85 to @xmath86 for the parameters used in the fast cooling case ( see above ) .    in principle",

    "3 to solve for the value of @xmath77 to determine if it is within the theoretical allowed range , thus providing a consistent estimate of @xmath3 in comparison with the observed spectral index .",
    "however , a spectral index has to be assumed to infer the observed x - ray luminosity . in order words ,",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath9 are not independent .",
    "furthermore , the errors in @xmath9 and @xmath88 do not provide an accurate estimate of @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , it is more practical to choose a possible value of @xmath77 with the constraint of theories ( e.g. bednarz & ostrowski 1998 , lemoine & pelletier 2003 ) to estimate @xmath9 and @xmath3 for comparison with those observed .",
    "we remark that since shock acceleration is a non - linear process , it would not be surprising that various observations lead to a range of @xmath77 . in the following applications , we will treat @xmath77 as a parameter but with the constraint that it should only vary between 2 and 3 as suggested by theoretical studies ( e.g. bednarz & ostrowski 1998 , lemoine & pelletier 2003 ) .      non - thermal radiation can also arise from a shock wave resulting from the interaction between the pulsar wind and the outflowing matter from the companion star ( arons & tavani 1993 , stella et al .",
    "1994 , tavani & arons 1997 ) . in this context , the neutron star is at a distance , @xmath89 , from the surface of its binary companion given by @xmath90 , where @xmath88 is the shock wave termination radius as measured from the neutron star surface and @xmath33 is the distance of the shock from the surface of the companion star . for millisecond pulsars in binary systems with low mass companions , we adopt an orbital separation @xmath91 cm .",
    "if we assume that mass is lost isotropically from the companion star , the loss rate is given as @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is its outflow velocity and @xmath94 is the density at distance @xmath33 from the stellar surface and @xmath95 is the radius of the companion . the dynamic outflow pressure given by @xmath96 can be expressed as p_w(r)= m v_w 4 ( r_*+r)^2 .",
    "the termination radius of the pulsar wind is given by the pressure balance between the pulsar and companion outflow and can be expressed as ( r_sr _ * + r ) ^2 = v_w c.    in order to estimate the shock radius , @xmath97 and @xmath93 must be determined . unlike the case of the progenitor of millisecond pulsars ,",
    "i.e. , the low mass x - ray binaries , where @xmath97 can be estimated from the x - ray accretion luminosity , the mass loss rate from the neutron star companion likely results from the evaporation by a pulsar wind ( ruderman , shaham & tavani 1989 ) .",

    "the coefficient in equation 7 will change to @xmath122 .",
    "thus , the emission from the intrabinary shock is expected to be in the slow cooling regime characterized by a photon index , @xmath123 , while the emission from the pulsar interaction with the interstellar medium can be either in the slow or fast cooling regime .",
    "in a recent study by stappers et al . ( 2003 ) an x - ray nebula in the vicinity of the millisecond pulsar b1957 + 20 was detected .",
    "a bright x - ray source in the field was found to be coincident with the pulsar position , and a tail of x - ray emission was seen extending from the pulsar to the northeast by at least 16 \" ( corresponding to @xmath124 cm at the distance of 1.5 kpc ) at a position angle opposite to the pulsar s direction of motion . taken together with the existence of a previously identified h@xmath125 bow shock structure ( kulkarni & hester 1988 ) enveloping this tail , psr b1957 + 20 is a prime example of an x - ray bow shock nebula in a pulsar binary system .",

    "we have suggested that the contribution of the pwn to the non - pulsed non thermal emission of millisecond pulsars in the cores of globular clusters is likely reduced due to the effect of interaction of stars with it .",
    "hence , the non - thermal x - ray contribution due to the pwn to the total x - ray emission may not be important in comparison to millisecond pulsars in the galactic field .",
    "for those millisecond pulsars with a binary companion in globular cluster systems , the emission from an intrabinary shock can be an important contributor to the non - thermal non - pulsed x - ray emission .",
    "in particular , it has been found ( see equation 7 ) that the non - thermal x - ray emission from an intrabinary shock in a binary millisecond pulsar system is very sensitive to the spin down power .",
    "for example , a spin down power of @xmath41 ergs s@xmath2 would yield a non - thermal x - ray luminosity of @xmath253 erg s@xmath2 for @xmath77 = 2.2 , making them difficult to detect at the present time .",
    "thus , the lack of non - thermal x - ray emission from the majority of binary millisecond pulsars in 47 tuc suggests that @xmath254 ergs s@xmath2 for the majority of these binary millisecond pulsars .",
    "in contrast , the non - thermal emission from isolated millisecond pulsars in globular clusters may have a contribution from the magnetosphere .",
    "the identification of a non - thermal non - pulsed component in globular cluster millisecond pulsars uncontaminated by source confusion could be especially important in constraining the flux level of such a component in pulsar emission models .",
    "some unpulsed x - ray emission is expected if the distribution of the pitch angles of charged particles in the magnetosphere is uniform . in this case , the synchrotron radiation from particles with very large pitch angle , say larger than 80@xmath255 , will tend to radiate isotropically .",
    "the luminosity of this component can be estimated as @xmath256 .",
    "here we have assumed that @xmath257 is given by the ratio of their angular distribution @xmath258 and @xmath259 is estimated by cheng & zhang ( 1999 ) .",
    "such a level of emission is comparable to the off - pulse x - ray emission detected from psr j0218 + 4232 and psr b1821 - 24 ( e.g. mineo et al .",
    "we remark that other emission sites for non - thermal non - pulsed x - rays have been suggested .",
    "for example , cheung & cheng ( 1994 ) have argued that pair production can still continue beyond the light cylinder , where the magnetic field lines are twisted and the pitch angles of the created pairs are large .",
    "consequently the radiation of relativistic electron and positron pairs will be not beamed .",
    "the characteristic photon index is @xmath260 . without high angular resolution",
    ", it will be difficult to distinguish the origin of the non - pulsed non - thermal x - ray emission .",
    "in particular , the photon index of the x - ray emission from the shock region in the slow cooling regime can not be differentiated from the unpulsed emission originating in the magnetosphere , making direct observational determination of the non - thermal x - ray emission location challenging .",
    "our model x - ray luminosity depends on several shock parameters .",
    "in particular , @xmath46 and @xmath56 are poorly determined .",
    "however , both equation 3 and equation 5 do not sensitively depend on @xmath56 if @xmath77 is around 2 .",
    "again the dependence on @xmath46 in equation 3 is also very weak .",
    "however , this parameter become important for the case of an intrabinary shock .",
    "in fact , by comparing with systems with a contribution from an intrabinary shock the inferred @xmath46 is significant larger than that of the crab nebula .",
    "for example , @xmath261 0.02 can match the observed data of psr1957 + 20 .",
    "although this is significantly higher than inferred for the crab nebula , it is consistent with the value obtained in psr 1259 - 63 ( tavani & arons 1997 ) .",
    "these results taken together point to the importance of the environmental properties of the surrounding medium on estimates of @xmath46 .    in this paper",
    ", we have further assumed that @xmath2620 in estimating the potential drop , where @xmath263 and @xmath110 are the dipole magnetic field and the angular velocity of the star respectively . in the case of @xmath2640 ,",
    "harding , usov & muslimov ( 2005 ) showed that the potential drop in the polar gap could be much larger than that estimated in  3.1 , however , the x - ray emission associated with the polar gap emission will be pulsed and also correlated with the gamma - ray emission .",
    "therefore this may provide a test to discriminate these two cases .",
    "finally , the pulsar wind interacting with a companion star and/or the interstellar medium may also contribute to the hard x - ray emission associated with soft x - ray transients in quiesence if a millisecond pulsar is activated during temporary states when the accretion of mass is significantly reduced or prevented by a rapidly rotating magnetosphere ( illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ) .",
    "we suggest that observations be carried out to search for the non - thermal radio emission that would accompany the hard x - ray emission associated with the synchrotron radiation process to confirm the viability of such an interpretation .",
    "if detected , millisecond pulsars in isolation and in binary systems may be more important contributors to the faint x - ray source population in the galaxy than has hitherto been considered .",
    "such an association may prove useful as a means of identifying candidate objects for further radio pulse timing searches of new millisecond pulsars .",
