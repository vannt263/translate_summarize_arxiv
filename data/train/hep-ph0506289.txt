    "the appearance of @xmath25 in the weak vertex is then handled by cyclically rotating these traces so that @xmath25 appears at the beginning of each trace , before performing the contraction of lorentz indices . using this prescription",
    "we have checked that the ward identity for the weak current is satisfied exactly and no additional counter terms are required .",

    "as such , the contribution from these diagrams when integrated over the total available phase space can be much larger than the lowest order @xmath0 cross section ( an order of magnitude at the lhc ) . in order to disentangle these two processes ,",
    "two methods have been outlined in the literature .",
    "the first involves making a cut on the invariant mass of the @xmath29 system to prevent the @xmath8 propagator from becoming resonant  @xcite .",
    "the second method instead subtracts the contribution from the resonant diagrams so that no on - shell piece remains  @xcite .",
    "a comparison of these two approaches  @xcite shows that the methods yield the same total cross section when a mass window of @xmath30  gev either side of the top mass is chosen .",
    "however , these methods do not lend themselves to a monte carlo implementation where one wishes to study distributions of final state particles as well as total cross sections .",
    "therefore we shall adopt neither of these prescriptions but instead follow a procedure motivated by our use of the bottom quark pdf .    in the @xmath2-pdf approach , the @xmath2 quark distribution function",
    "is derived perturbatively from a collinear @xmath31 splitting that occurs in the initial state .",
    "it implicitly includes all splittings up to a @xmath32 of the @xmath27-quark equal to the factorization scale , @xmath33 .",
    "this means that the contribution from the corresponding @xmath34 diagrams ( contained in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : wtbdiags ] ) has already been included in the lowest order calculation .",
    "therefore the net contribution from these diagrams , including appropriate counter - terms and integrating over all @xmath27 quark transverse momenta up to @xmath33 , should be approximately zero . for a suitable choice of @xmath33",
    "we have checked that this is indeed the case .",
    "the choice of @xmath33 is made such that the collinear approximation used in deriving the @xmath2-pdf is accurate , which for this process implies that @xmath35  gev  .",

    "[ fig : wtbdiags ] when the @xmath32 of the @xmath27 quark is small , @xmath36 .",
    "however , these diagrams simply represent the doubly - resonant @xmath5 production process which is currently known up to nlo   nlo rate , which is known  @xcite . ] .",
    "therefore it is preferable to separate this contribution from the ` genuine ' nlo corrections to the @xmath0 process . as we shall show later , although the contribution from the @xmath5 diagrams in this region of phase space is rather small in relation to the total cross section",
    ", it is still competitive with the @xmath0 result .",
    "this suppression means that the interference effects between the two sets of diagrams is very small when using a @xmath2-jet veto , in contrast to the case when @xmath37 is unconstrained  @xcite .",
    "when a @xmath27 quark is observed with a @xmath32 above @xmath33 then our description of the final state is a lowest order one .",
    "the contribution from the doubly - resonant diagrams dominates and , as above , a better prediction would be obtained by using the @xmath5 process . alternatively",
    ", one could use a calculation including all the diagrams for @xmath38 , including the @xmath39 decay ( retaining the @xmath2 quark mass ) and also finite width effects  @xcite .",
    "however , currently this study would be limited to leading order in @xmath40 only .    to summarize",
    ", we shall perform our calculation of the @xmath0 process by applying a veto on the @xmath32 of the additional @xmath2 quark that appears at next - to - leading order .",
    "this aids the separation of this process from doubly - resonant @xmath5 production . when applying this veto , one should choose the factorization scale equal to ( or at least of the same order as ) the maximum @xmath32 of the @xmath2 quark that is allowed , @xmath41",
    "this choice respects the approximations that were originally used to define the @xmath2 quark pdf . for @xmath42 and for less inclusive quantities ,",
    "the contribution from the @xmath34 diagrams is calculated by simply omitting the doubly - resonant diagrams  . the result for",
    "this piece remains at the level of a few percent of the lowest order cross section .",
    "before discussing the effect of including radiation in the decay of the top quark , we will first consider just the @xmath0 total cross section in order to discuss some features of our approach and to compare our results with those available in the literature .",
    "the nlo corrections to the total @xmath0 cross section , where no decay of the top quark is included , were previously presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the sake of comparison , in this section we will adopt the parameters therein as closely as possible .",
    "in particular , we choose @xmath43  gev and the cteq5 set of parton distribution functions  .",
    "the other electroweak parameters that enter our calculation are chosen to be , m_w=80.419  gev , g_w^2=0.4267 .",
    "we perform our comparison at the lhc and examine the dependence of our results on the common renormalization and factorization scale @xmath44 .",
    "as we have already argued , the @xmath2-pdf approach is most well - motivated when choosing a value of @xmath44 less than about @xmath45  gev .",
    "however , such a value is much smaller than the more typical choice , @xmath46 which is the central value chosen in ref .",
    "therefore , for the sake of illustration , we choose to study the scale dependence over a large range from @xmath47 gev up to @xmath48  gev . as we have discussed above , we limit the @xmath32 of the @xmath2 quark that appears at next - to - leading order to have a maximum value @xmath41 , which we choose here to be @xmath49  gev .",

    "the lowest order cross section is the dashed curve , whilst the nlo one  calculated with @xmath52  gev  is solid .",

    "we see that this is improved still further , with the cross section varying by about @xmath53 over the range of scales shown in the figure .    comparing with zhu  @xcite , we find a number of differences . even at",
    "lowest order our result for @xmath46 is higher and furthermore , the dependence of the result on this scale appears less mild ( c.f .",
    "fig .  2 of ref .",
    "however , we have checked the lowest order results of our program against those obtained with madevent  @xcite and found good agreement . at next - to - leading order",
    "we also find a slightly different result , lower and with a stronger dependence on the scale . in this case",
    ", we expect some discrepancy due to our different method of handling the @xmath54 contribution .",
    "we note that the combination of the @xmath27-jet veto and our preferred choice of a much smaller scale , leads to a next - to - leading order cross section that is about @xmath55 smaller than that found by zhu .",
    "in addition , the @xmath56-factor , defined as the ratio of nlo and lo cross sections , is much smaller and in the range @xmath57@xmath58 depending on the scale choice .",
    "finally , we consider the dependence of our result on the choice for @xmath41 . in fig .",

    "one sees that , within this window , the scale dependence of the next - to - leading order calculation is again somewhat smaller than that found at lo and improves as the veto threshold is raised . compared to a threshold of @xmath49  gev , the cross section decreases by about @xmath55 when lowering the veto to @xmath60  gev .",

    "lastly , our predictions are performed at parton - level only and lack any modelling of hadronization and showering .",
    "this is particularly relevant to our phenomenological analysis , where the application of a jet veto at relatively low transverse momenta ( compared to the top quark mass ) increases the sensivity to soft - gluon effects .",
