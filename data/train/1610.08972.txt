    "the discovery of the accelerating universe by two teams @xcite in the late 1990 s was one of the major breakthroughs in cosmology . using type - ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) as standard candles",
    ", both teams independently determined that high - redshift sne were fainter than expected in a matter - dominated universe , implying the need for a cosmological constant ( or more generally , dark energy ) to accelerate the expansion of the universe , increasing cosmological distance as a function of redshift .",
    "sne ia are not perfect standard candles , however .",
    "work leading up to the discovery @xcite demonstrated the need for empirical standardization relations .",
    "peak absolute magnitudes correlate with the width of the light curve ( broader - light - curve sne are more luminous ) and the color of the supernova ( redder sne are less luminous ) . in the years since , other empirical standardization relations have been noted , including one related to host - galaxy stellar mass @xcite ( perhaps driven significantly by the local star formation rate , @xcite ) .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and supernova legacy survey ( snls ) sn teams have completed the joint light - curve analysis ( jla ) @xcite .",
    "this analysis incorporates a thorough recalibration of both surveys @xcite , and the full set of spectroscopically confirmed sdss sne ia @xcite ; it represents the most up - to - date large sne ia compilation . of the world sample of sne ia , so we expect constraints to continue to rapidly improve . ] a recent claim ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter n16 ) was made that this dataset provides only `` marginal evidence '' for acceleration .",
    "we examine the statistical model n16 used to make this claim , and find it deficient for the task . in particular , a simple ( and well - justified ) update of the model to better account for changes in the observed sn light - curve parameter distributions with redshift significantly increases the statistical strength of the acceleration evidence .",
    "in the case of jla , the standardization relations employed are light - curve width ( @xmath2 in the framework of salt2 , @xcite ) , color ( @xmath3 ) , and host - galaxy stellar mass .",
    "the dependent variable is taken to be the rest - frame @xmath4-band magnitude ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the light - curve parameters are determined by comparing a rest - frame spectral energy distribution model to the observer - frame photometry ; similarly , the host stellar mass is estimated from broad - band photometry .",
    "the cosmological results rely on the ability of the statistical framework to fit the standardization relations ( in jla , these are taken to be linear in @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and a step function in host mass ) , yet the uncertainties ( a general term that we take to include unexplained dispersion around the model ) in the dependent variable ( @xmath5 ) and independent variables ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , host mass ) are of similar size . the jla analysis itself used a frequentist line - fitting procedure with only modest biases in its regime of applicability @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the statistical model from n16 uses a bayesian hierarchical model ( c.f . , @xcite ) .",
    "in the n16 model , the latent ( `` true '' ) parameters for each sn are modeled with nuisance parameters , which are marginalized over to obtain inference on the global parameters .",
    "the distribution of the latent parameters must be adequately described by the prior .",
    "for example , flat priors on the latent variables cause a bias in the fit @xcite . making the parameters of the prior ( `` hyperparameters '' )",
    "part of the model avoids this bias ( this multi - level nature gives rise to the name `` hierarchical '' ) .",
    "the key shortcoming of the n16 model is that it assumes redshift - independent distributions for @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : jlavsz ] , the observed distributions ( plotted points ) are far from redshift - independent .",
    "two effects visible in the data  selection effects and the correlation between older host galaxies and narrower - light - curve ( lower @xmath2 ) sne @xcite  result in a more luminous distribution of sne as an increasing function of redshift .",
    "the selection effects are particularly evident in color , where only bluer sne ( more negative @xmath3 ) are above the completeness limit for the high - redshift end of each ground - based sample . by incorrectly treating these distributions as redshift - independent",
    ", n16 biased their latent @xmath2 and @xmath3 towards the global mean , effectively removing some of the standardization @xcite .",
    "the jla sample was corrected for selection bias in @xcite , but only in the sense that sne which are selected to be more luminous _",
    "after standardization _ are adjusted to be less luminous .",
    "the bias correction can not compensate for a deficient standardization , as provided by a constant - in - redshift model of the distributions .      as a starting point",
    ", we perform an analysis similar to that in n16 , using hamiltonian monte carlo to sample from the posterior ( we describe the details in appendix  [ sec : app ] ) . we assume a cosmological model with cold matter and a cosmological constant ( @xmath6cdm ) .",
    "we make four measurements : a @xmath6cdm universe allowed to have spatial curvature ( i.e. , @xmath7 ) , and a flat @xmath6cdm universe ( the assumption of flatness is discussed more in the discussion section ) , each with both sets of model assumptions .",
    "we compute the deceleration parameter @xmath8 , ( @xmath9 , equal to @xmath10 for a @xmath6cdm cosmology ) .",
    "we evaluate the statistical significance of acceleration ( @xmath11 ) by comparing the 50th percentile of the posterior with the difference of the 50th percentile and the 84th percentile ( taken as an estimate of 1@xmath12 in the @xmath13 direction ) , and then rounding to @xmath14 .",
    "the statistical significance of the acceleration is @xmath15with no constraint on curvature , and @xmath16assuming a flat universe ( see figures [ fig : omol ] , [ fig : qnot ] , left panels ) .",
    "the difference between this estimate and one derived from explicitly measuring the fraction of samples with @xmath17 is modest ( 66 posterior samples out of 60,000 have @xmath17 ) .",
    "next , we introduce a simple model of the observed distributions as a function of redshift .",
    "we allow each source of sn discovery ( nearby , sloan digital sky survey , supernova legacy survey , _ hubble space telescope _ ) to have a linear variation in the mean with redshift ( for the _ hubble space telescope_sne , we use only a constant mean in redshift , as this sample is too small to constrain any variation ) .",
    "this model is shown in figure  [ fig : jlavsz ] ; the variation with redshift is highly statistically significant .",
    "we also try a more flexible model in redshift @xcite , and it makes only a small difference ( the only requirement on the model is to be at least as flexible in redshift as the cosmological model under consideration , * ? ? ?",
    "the statistical significance of the acceleration increases to @xmath0 , and @xmath1assuming a flat universe ( see figures [ fig : omol ] , [ fig : qnot ] , right panels ) .",
    "again , the difference between this estimate and one derived from explicitly measuring the fraction of samples with @xmath17 is modest ( only one posterior sample out of 60,000 has @xmath17 ) .              for a result that relies only on kinematics ,",
    "we also compute @xmath8 constraints using the @xcite series expansion of luminosity distance as a function of redshift .",
    "we take the first three terms ( including @xmath8 and @xmath18 ) .",
    "the @xmath8 constraints are illustrated on the third row of figure  [ fig : qnot ] .",
    "even with flat priors on @xmath8 and @xmath19 ( allowing the kinematics to venture into regions of parameter space that may be hard to realize dynamically ) , we find 3.7@xmath12 evidence for acceleration ( 2.8@xmath12 with the n16 model ) .",
    "sn data alone can be used to derive constraints on the joint posterior of @xmath20 and the dark energy equation of state parameter ( @xmath21 ) , assuming a flat universe @xcite ; we compute constraints for this model as well . for simplicity , we take a flat prior on both @xmath20 and @xmath22 , and find strong evidence for @xmath23 , as shown in the bottom row of figure  [ fig : qnot ]",
    "the constraints on @xmath8 are non - gaussian , but in both the n16 model and ours , no samples ( out of 60,000 ) have @xmath24 .",
    "we next project the constraints from each of our four models to the @xmath8-@xmath25 $ ] plane , shown in figure  [ fig : qnotjnot ] ( both @xmath19 and @xmath26 contribute linearly at the same order in luminosity distance , so we can not distinguish them in this plane ) .",
    "the constraints for 2d models ( models other than flat @xmath6cdm ) are similar . however ,",
    "the high @xmath8/low @xmath25 $ ] region is disfavored by the dynamical models , as @xmath20-@xmath22 can not reach @xmath27 , and even an empty universe (  milne model  * ? ? ?",
    "* ) only has @xmath28 .",
    "-@xmath25 $ ] constraints enclosing 95.4% of the samples from the posterior . for the flat @xmath6cdm results , we show the 1d credible interval . ]",
    "our results ( flat - universe @xmath29 ) are similar to the frequentist jla analysis ( flat - universe @xmath30 ) .",
    "this is unsurprising ; frequentist and bayesian analyses will converge to exactly the same results under a set of assumptions not far from those made here @xcite .",
    "we also note that more advanced analyses can better take into account statistical properties of the data ( modeling selection effects , non - linear standardization relations , a redshift - dependent host - mass relation , outliers , and a model of unexplained dispersion incorporating @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) @xcite .",
    "n16 did not include the host - mass standardization ; excluding this only has a small impact on our results.cdm with curvature , the significance of the acceleration changes from @xmath0 with to @xmath31 without the host - mass relation .",
    "] however , we focus our attention on the n16 model of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 distributions , as it is this model that drives the difference from the jla analysis .",
    "while constraints derived from sne ia alone require a @xmath32 flatness constraint to push the supernova measurement of acceleration above @xmath33 , current experiments have constrained curvature to much better precision than @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "even constraints on @xmath20 ( e.g. , galaxy clusters , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which imply @xmath35 , cut off the tail of the sn - only posterior extending down to a milne universe and @xmath17 , allowing the acceleration to again reach @xmath33 confidence . at all times , rather than specifically an empty universe . in the @xmath8-@xmath25 $ ] plane ( figure  [ fig : qnotjnot ] ) , it is clear why the distinction is important ; models that are curvature - dominated allow low @xmath36 , and thus high @xmath8 ; even weak flatness constraints disfavor that portion of parameter space . ] with the combination of current experiments ( sne ia , baryon acoustic oscillations , cosmic microwave background , and the hubble constant ) , @xmath37 is constrained to be @xmath38 @xcite . in order to claim that the evidence for acceleration is `` marginal , '' it is necessary to fully reject all measurements of the curvature of the universe , the basic constraints on the matter density of the universe , and other cosmological datasets .    even without external constraints ,",
    "this work demonstrates that a more accurate model for the supernova analysis greatly increases the significance of acceleration .",
    "we conclude that the analysis in n16 is both incorrect in its method and unreasonable in its assumptions , leading the authors to question a result that is quite secure when addressed properly .",
