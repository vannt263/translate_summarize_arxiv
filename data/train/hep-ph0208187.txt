    "this approach makes the inclusion of nlo qcd corrections straightforward , however , it neglects corrections of order @xmath229 induced by nonzero @xmath228 @xcite . as a consequence , one should view our target mass corrections as approximate .    in any case , the dis cross section in the energy region below @xmath230 gev is difficult to interpret . at best , the uncut cross section is a crude approximation to the total cross section including resonant hadron production , _",

    "in this appendix we pinpoint the approximations for which the albright - jarlskog relations ( ajrs ) ( [ eq : aj1 ] ) and ( [ eq : aj2 ] ) hold beyond the naive parton model ( where they are exact ) .",

    "the latter involves a contraction with @xmath242 .",
    "now , as long as we make the single @xmath201 boson exchange approximation , the dis process is equivalent to an effectively abelian ( electroweak ) interaction _ if _ all quarks are massless ( or of the same mass ) .",
    "then , @xmath243 is guaranteed by naive gauge invariance under @xmath244 .",
    "this is a stronger statement than helicity conservation for massless spin-1/2 quarks because gauge invariance holds to any order in @xmath151 while helicity conservation breaks down when non - collinear nlo radiation generates angular momentum .",
    "a transition @xmath89 with @xmath245 , however , is necessarily non - diagonal in flavour space and the interaction can not be abelianized",
    ". thus , naive gauge invariance does not hold and the second ajr ( [ eq : aj2 ] ) is not protected from charm mass corrections .",
    "it will , however , hold at any order in @xmath151 for massless quarks .",
    "worth mentioning is also that @xmath246 at @xmath247   even for the charm production process , indicating that @xmath248 at lo .",
    "this should be compared to the longitudinal structure function @xmath249 which does not vanish by helicity conservation in lo when a massive charm quark is produced in the final state .",
    "now , @xmath8 is obtained from @xmath250 at the parton level , @xmath236 is the _ incoming _ parton momentum @xmath251 .",
