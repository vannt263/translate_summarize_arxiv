    "single - bubble sonoluminescence ( sbsl or simply sl ) , first discovered in 1989 , is a phenomenon of periodic light emission by an oscillating gas bubble trapped in the pressure antinode of a standing ultrasound wave in water ( or other fluids ) ( see @xcite for detailed reviews on sbsl ) .",
    "the oscillating bubble is stable enough to survive many days through billions of acoustic cycles while the produced flashes are highly regular and incandescent .",
    "the width of the emitted light pulse is around @xmath0 with a peak power of the order @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the light pulse has nearly a gaussian shape with a slight asymmetry , which is basically identical in the red and uv portions of the spectrum @xcite , and hiller _ et al . _",
    "@xcite further confirmed that the pulse width and the emission time were independent of wavelength .",
    "however , in an interesting twist , moran _",
    "_ @xcite demonstrated that the pulse width did exhibit a mild dependence on wavelength at @xmath2 , but not at @xmath3 . besides",
    ", the power spectrum of the emitted light was found to be broadband without any characteristic line , decreasing from the uv portion towards the red in a way that bore a resemblance to a blackbody spectrum @xcite .",
    "sbsl has become an intriguing topic and an arena for experimentalists and theorists alike since its discovery .",
    "numerous attempts have been made to study the bubble motion using classical bubble dynamics and sophisticated computational fluid mechanics ( cfm ) @xcite .",
    "it is generally believed that the bubble is heated to temperatures of tens of thousands and shock waves and plasma could be generated during the contraction of the bubble .",
    "various proposals have been put forward to explain the light emission mechanism , including surface blackbody radiation @xcite , neutral and ion bremsstrahlung @xcite , collision - induced emission @xcite , quantum vacuum radiation @xcite , confined - electron model @xcite , proton - tunnelling @xcite , and nuclear fusion @xcite .",
    "some of these proposals , e.g. @xcite , attributed light emission in sbsl to the high temperature attained in the bubble and are classified as thermal radiation schemes in this paper .",
    "while qualitatively reproducing the spectra detected in sbsl , most of such thermal schemes failed to explain why the pulse width is wavelength - independent as measured in some experiments @xcite . owing to this major drawback of thermal schemes ,",
    "researchers were forced to look into other non - thermal and more exotic models ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .    to reconcile the success and",
    "the drawback of thermal radiation schemes , hilgenfeldt , grossmann and lohse @xcite took the finite opacity of the bubble into consideration and obtained a wavelength - independent pulse width for argon bubbles . the impact of hilgenfeldt _ et al .",
    "_ s work is huge and , to some extent , resurrects the thermal radiation scheme .",
    "however , it is worthwhile to note that the approach adopted in @xcite is deemed a simplified version of the emission mechanism of sbsl as several physical processes have not been included in the proposal @xcite .",
    "for example , the sonoluminescing bubble is modelled as a uniform one and the fluid dynamics inside the bubble has been neglected from the outset @xcite .",
    "besides , the kirchhoff s law used in @xcite to evaluate thermal emissivity of the bubble has completely ignored the wave nature of light .    in addition , existing literature ( e.g. @xcite ) demonstrates there exists a gap in the theoretical treatment of light emission mechanism of sonoluminescence , in that blackbody radiation and thermal bremsstrahlung are often ascribed as separate possible mechanisms of sbsl .",
    "often , planck s formula for blackbody radiation @xcite and absorption coefficients for thermal bremsstrahlung in vacuum @xcite are applied separately in these cases , and the question of whether the bubble is opaque enough to demonstrate blackbody radiation is argued in a rather hand - waving manner by comparing the photon mean path with an estimated size of the light - emitting region . in our view , this is because of the lack of a single theory which can take account of both mechanisms in a finite - sized environment ( i.e. the bubble ) in a unifying manner . in a recent experimental paper @xcite , flannigan _",
    "et al_. demonstrated conclusively the existence of a plasma state inside the bubble , and hence thermal bremsstrahlung is an inevitable consequence because of the motion of the electrons and ions .",
    "we emphasize that blackbody radiation and thermal bremsstrahlung are nothing but one single emission mechanism manifested upon the degree of optical thickness of the bubble ; and to this purpose , in this paper we have developed a coherent theory unifying both aspects in the context of sbsl . within the framework of this theory , when the bubble becomes optically thick enough , the thermal bremsstrahlung manifest itself asymptotically as blackbody radiation .",
    "first , we will consider thermal emission in a realistic sonoluminescing bubble that is non - uniform in temperature as well as density . to properly describe processes of thermal emission and absorption in a finite volume with a size comparable to the wavelength of light in a consistent manner ,",
    "the generalized kirchhoff s law is used in our paper @xcite .",
    "second , state- of - the - art cfm is applied here to evaluate the temperature and density distributions in the bubble @xcite . through such elaboration of the thermal radiation scheme @xcite",
    ", we succeed in obtaining an emission spectrum that agrees nicely with the experimental data as summarized in @xcite and , in addition , resolve the dilemma of whether the pulse width is dependent on the wavelength .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",

    "in sl , the high temperature reached inside the bubble ionizes the gas content , forming a partially ionized plasma @xcite .",
    "besides having finite optical thickness , the bubble has a size @xmath4 near the instant of maximum compression , which is comparable to the wavelength of the emitted light ranging from @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "hence , the assumption of geometric optics is invalid . to properly take account of the effects of finite absorption , wave reflection and diffraction , we employ in this paper the generalized kirchhoff s law @xcite , which yields the ` classical ' form of kirchhoff s law as an asymptotic limit , to compute the power spectrum .",
    "we first review the statement of the ` classical ' form of kirchhoff s law ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "consider an isotropic absorbing medium with complex dielectric constant @xmath7 , refractive index @xmath8 , and a typical size @xmath9 . if the medium is in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath10 and @xmath9 is large compared with the wavelength of light @xmath11 so that the geometric optics approximation holds , then the classical form of kirchhoff s law relates the emission coefficient @xmath12 and the absorption coefficient @xmath13 at ( angular ) frequency @xmath14 as @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the ( frequency ) spectral light intensity of a blackbody for one polarization , with @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 being the speed of light in vacuum , the planck constant @xmath20 divided by @xmath21 , and the boltzmann constant , respectively .",
    "we remark that , besides the assumption @xmath22 , its application is justified only to a volume emitter which is optically thin .",
    "the generalized kirchhoff s law @xcite is a generalization of the classical form of kirchhoff s law to all sizes @xmath9 and optical thickness of a finite - size emitter , and can be derived from the maxwell equations : @xmath23 here the electric field @xmath24 , the magnetic induction @xmath25 , the displacement field @xmath26 and the magnetic field strength @xmath27 are generated by the fluctuating charge density @xmath28 and current density @xmath29 , which are direct consequence of the random thermal motions of the charges and satisfy the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( see , e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the @xmath32-component of the fourier transform of @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the average energy of a quantum harmonic oscillator at temperature @xmath10 , and @xmath35 is permittivity constant of vacuum .    in the presence of the thermal fluctuations @xmath28 and @xmath29 , all fields @xmath36 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath37 are thermally fluctuating quantities .",
    "the set of stochastic equations , ( [ thr2])-([thr5 ] ) , together with the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , completely determine the statistics of the electromagnetic field of such a system and the relevant theory is termed the thermal electromagnetic theory ( tet ) @xcite .",
    "the generalized kirchhoff s law derived from tet @xcite states that the spectral radiance @xmath38 , defined as the power emitted per unit wavelength interval and unit solid angle , is given by the following formula @xcite : @xmath39 here @xmath40 is the spectral radiance in the direction of @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the absorption cross - sectional area of the emitter for an electromagnetic wave illuminating the emitter from the direction of @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is the spectral light intensity in each polarization for an ideal blackbody . in ( [ thr33 ] )",
    "it is understood that @xmath45 is the sum of the absorption cross - sectional areas for incident light waves with two perpendicular polarizations .",
    "it is evident that @xmath46 is equal to the power @xmath47 dissipated in the emitter for an incident plane wave carrying unit energy flux , which can be obtained from the following volume integral over the emitter : @xmath48 it is worthwhile to note that @xmath49 the electric field developed inside the emitter might be strongly enhanced at certain frequencies due to resonance effects and thus carries non - trivial frequency dependence @xcite .",
    "besides the spectral radiance , the integrated power of the emitted light pulse is another quantity measured in sbsl experiments and is simply the integral of eq .",
    "( [ thr33 ] ) over the wavelength , @xmath50",
    "we now apply the generalized kirchhoff s law summarized above to consider light emission in the uniform bubble model ( ubm ) as proposed in @xcite .",
    "we will see that the formula for the spectral radiance used in @xcite is only an approximate one that is valid only under certain restrictions .    to use a simple situation to elucidate the generalized kirchhoff s law , we first calculate the power emitted from a slab .",
    "consider a weakly absorbing slab illuminated normally by a plane - polarized plane wave with unit flux . under the assumption that the slab ( with thickness @xmath51 and area @xmath52 ) has dimensions sufficiently large so that multiple internal reflections can be neglected and the internal electric field can be represented by a single decaying , travelling wave only , the internal power loss can be found from eq .",

    "this result is consistent with that obtained from the standard radiative transfer theory @xcite , upon which the spectral radiance obtained in @xcite is founded .    in the following",

    "such an emission model will be referred to as the geometric optics model ( gom ) in the following discussion . as we will show in our numerical results ( sec .",
    "[ ups ] ) , the conditions for the validity of gom do not generally hold in a realistic sl model .",
    "as discussed in sect .  [ gom ] , hilgenfeldt _ et al . _ @xcite have assumed ubm as well as gom in deriving the spectral radiance .",
    "this simplification serves as an illustration of the essential ingredients in sbsl .",
    "yet its validity has to be verified , and for realistic calculations comparable to the experiment , it is necessary to take full account of the hydrodynamics inside the bubble . in light of this , in the following we will employ cfm developed by ho _",
    "@xcite to simulate the hydrodynamics of the bubble .",
    "it is then obvious that ubm breaks down in such situation and , instead , we can model the inhomogeneous sl bubble as a multilayered sphere ( mls ) with a piecewise - constant configuration of temperature and refractive index ( see fig .  [ scrf1 ] ) .",
    "in realistic calculations , the number of layers is so large that mls is able to mimic the continuous distribution obtained from cfm . on the other hand ,",
