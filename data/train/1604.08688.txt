    "in 1985 , david deutsch provided the first quantum algorithm that showed the potential for quantum computing to be more powerful than classical computing  deutsch s algorithm @xcite .",
    "it was later expanded upon by richard jozsa @xcite , and improved by cleve , ekert , macchiavello and masca @xcite , resulting in the multi - qubit generalization known today as deutsch - jozsa algorithm .",
    "one of the key features of the algorithm is that creates a superposition of all possible states , then is followed by an interference and measurement step  a key component of many quantum algorithms .",
    "it therefore paved the way for other more practical quantum algorithms such as grover s algorithm @xcite and shor",
    "s algorithm @xcite , both of which provide a quantum mechanical speedup over the best available classical algorithms . for this reason the algorithm remains important from a theoretical point of view of the power of quantum computing , and from an experimental point of view as a proof - of - principle operation of quantum computer prototypes .",
    "examples of experimental demonstration of deutsch - jozsa algorithm include nmr @xcite , superconducting qubits @xcite , single photon linear optics @xcite , and trapped ions @xcite .",
    "currently demonstrations of quantum algorithms are typically limited to @xmath0 qubits , due to limitations with decoherence and scalability of current quantum computing technologies .    to implement a given quantum algorithm ,",
    "currently there are two main paradigms of quantum computation , using either discrete or continuous variables ( cv ) .",
    "the most commonly used approach uses discrete quantum states to encode quantum information , typically in the form of qubits .",
    "alternatively , one may store quantum information in a bosonic mode which has an infinite hilbert space dimension , and states can be visualized in the phase space of position and momentum @xcite .",
    "an equivalent approach involves using total spin operators as quasi - bosonic variables to implement cv @xcite .",
    "recently , a third alternative to these paradigms has emerged @xcite , having characteristics common to both .",
    "the scheme  which we call ensemble quantum computation ( eqc )  stores quantum information on ensembles of qubits and manipulates them using only products of total spin operators .",
    "while it has been known for some time that it is possible to form continuous variable bosonic mode operators using polarized spins , the scheme differs from this by the full use of the space of states available on the bloch sphere . for continuous variables implementations",
    "typically the spins are polarized in the @xmath1 direction and only small deviations from this are induced .",
    "the scheme has the advantage that it has the same bloch sphere structure as is the case with standard qubits , yet with a natural robustness due to the use of ensembles instead of single qubits .",
    "as the states that are used are not explicitly gaussian in a cv sense , many of the no - go results for continuous variables do not immediately apply , making non - trivial operations possible with low order products of spin operators .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that universal operations are possible with products of one and two total spin operators @xcite .",
    "one of the difficulties with eqc is that it is not always straightforward to translate a qubit or cv quantum algorithm into that with ensembles .",
    "part of the difficulty here is that due to the large hilbert space available to the ensemble as compared to the original qubit circuit , the mapping is not unique .",
    "thus there is a great amount of freedom in choosing the best encoding of the original problem in the ensemble case , and the best way to do this . by `` best '' way ,",
    "this includes considerations such as : ( i ) requiring no complicated hamiltonians beyond low - order products of total spin operators ; ( ii ) the output of the quantum algorithm is not adversely affected by the generation of unstable quantum states such as schrodinger cat states ; ( iii ) the performance of the algorithm ( as measured by e.g. success probability , fidelity , etc . )",
    "remains the same or acceptably high under realistic conditions .",
    "for these reasons , the mapping between qubit algorithms to eqc requires some analysis , and currently no general procedure exists to map between the two .",
    "nevertheless , to date several algorithms have been shown to be mapped , incuding quantum teleportation @xcite and deutsch s algorithm @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we provide a full analysis of mapping the deutsch - jozsa algorithm to eqc .",
    "our aim is to start with the qubit version of the algorithm , and convert this to an implementation using ensembles and ultimately a hamiltonian involving only products of total spin operators . as mentioned above ,",
    "as the eqc mapping involves mapping qubits onto ensembles , there are in fact many possible mappings which in principle accomplishes the task . partly to this reason",
    ", we find two viable mappings , which are both presented in this paper .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ensembleqc ] we give a review of the eqc framework , in the interest of this paper being self - contained .",
    "we then review the deutsch - jozsa algorithm for qubits in sec .",
    "[ sec : djforqubits ] , which serves to introduce our notation . due to the rather detailed nature of this paper",
    ", we then summarize in sec .",
    "[ sec : djforeqc ] our final results for how to map the deutsch - jozsa algorithm onto eqc for readers who are not interested in the details of the proof .",
    "the remaining sections are devoted to the proof of how the eqc mapping works .",
    "one of the results that we will require is an explicit form of the oracle hamiltonian for qubits , which is derived in sec . [",
    "sec : oracle ] .",
    "we show that some of these implementations are more favorable for the eqc than others . in the case",
    "that it is possible to choose exactly how the oracle is implemented , a mapping that is robust against decoherence for eqc is presented ( sec .",
    "[ sec : method2 ] ) . in the case",
    "that the oracle is strictly not choosable , and it must be mapped directly from the qubit case , we provide another mapping which works for all cases ( sec .",
    "[ sec : method1 ] ) .",
    "we finally summarize our findings in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "in this section we provide a brief summary of the essential aspects of eqc , for the benefit of this paper being self - contained .",
    "a more detailed description is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in eqc",
    ", quantum information is stored on ensembles of two level systems .",
    "this can be either a large number of individual qubits such as an atomic ensemble , or a two - component bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) @xcite . in this approach",
    ", the quantum information corresponding to a qubit @xmath2 with @xmath3 is stored as a spin coherent state . for an atomic ensemble , this is written @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the logical states of the @xmath7th qubit in the ensemble . in the case of a bec , the spin coherent state is @xmath8 where @xmath9 are bosonic annihilation operators satisfying @xmath10=[b , b^\\dagger]=1 $ ] corresponding to the two logical states that store the quantum information . in each case",
    "we assume a fixed number of particles @xmath11 in the ensemble or bec .    the states in ( [ eq : ensemblestate ] ) and ( [ eq : becstate ] ) may be expanded in terms of fock states with definite particle number . for the ensemble system",
    "we may define @xmath12 where @xmath13 and the sum is restricted states with @xmath14 spins in the state @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the state @xmath17 . for the bec case",
    ", the fock states are @xmath18 the spin coherent states ( [ eq : ensemblestate ] ) and ( [ eq : becstate ] ) can be expanded using fock states into @xmath19 which is true for both the ensemble and bec cases .    for manipulation of the state ( [ eq : ensemblestate ] ) and",
    "( [ eq : becstate ] ) we use the total spin operators @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the pauli operators for each qubit in the ensemble , defined according to @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the kronecker delta . for the bec case , the total spin operators are schwinger boson operators @xmath25 the fock states are eigenstates of the @xmath26 operator , both for the ensemble and bec cases we have @xmath27    the total spin operators obey the same commutation relations as pauli operators @xmath28 = 2 i \\epsilon_{ijk } s^k \\label{commutation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the levi - civita antisymmetric tensor . while ( [ commutation ] ) suggests an analogous structure to standard qubits",
    ", the total spin operators do not satisfy @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the kronecker delta . for qubits @xmath32 , the anticommutation relation is satisfied , which in many cases results in simplifications .",
    "for example , ( [ anticommutation ] ) implies that @xmath33 , which is not true for the @xmath34 case . for our calculations we will generally use the bec formulation of the total spins ( [ bosonicspins ] ) rather than the ensemble formulation ( [ ensemblespins ] ) for the sake of mathematical simplicity .",
    "in fact these are equivalent as long as all physical operations and the initial conditions of the spins are symmetric under particle interchange .",
    "thus either ensembles or becs could be used experimentally .",
    "the aim of eqc is then exploit the analogous structure of the spin coherent states to qubits to provide a framework for quantum computation . in the same way as qubits and cv approaches where many qubits and modes are used to store the quantum information , in a typical eqc algorithm one would use several ensembles , which are potentially entangled together .",
    "a typical entangling interaction between ensembles that is considered is a @xmath35 interaction , as this can be implemented experimentally using several schemes @xcite .",
    "such an interaction produces in general a complex entangled state , exhibiting entanglement with a fractal structure @xcite .",
    "nevertheless for particular gate times this has a simplified structure which may be used for quantum information tasks @xcite .",
    "one of the advantages of eqc is that quantum information is always stored in a highly duplicated way .",
    "this allows for a more robust storage of quantum information as the loss or corruption of a few of the particles making up the ensemble impacts the total spin in a negligible way .",
    "this is in contrast to single particle storage methods where one qubit s worth of information is stored on one physical qubit . in this case if the particle is lost or an error occurs , all the quantum information is destroyed , which motivates quantum error correction .",
    "another benefit is that experimentally manipulating ensembles is an easier task technically compared to single particles , with the additional benefit of an increased signal to noise in any measurement readout .",
    "although not used in this paper , another benefit is that ensembles have the possibility of non - destructive readout , an operation which is fundamentally not possible with qubit based systems @xcite .    due to the larger hilbert space available to the ensembles ,",
    "given a quantum algorithm intended for qubits , in principle there are many ways to map it only the ensemble system .",
    "for example , one simple way would be to pick two states in the ensemble and use this as the logical states .",
    "however , such an approach would not be desirable as it would be experimentally challenging to target two particular states in the ensemble . by this",
    "we mean that exotic gates with complex hamiltonians are required .",
    "it is also potentially susceptible to decoherence .",
    "for example , using an encoding of states such as @xmath36 and @xmath37 would correspond to using schrodinger cat - like states , which are vulnerable to decoherence .    for these reasons we impose the following additional restrictions and assumptions when constructing a quantum algorithm in eqc :    * only gates involving hamiltonians with linear products of total spins @xmath38 are used .",
    "* measurements are made in a collective basis , e.g. @xmath26 .",
    "* the performance of the algorithm should not degrade exponentially with particle number @xmath11 under decoherence .",
    "* the gate resource count for applying a gate to an ensemble is the same as for a qubit .",
    "the first and second restrictions ensure that any algorithm constructed should be able to be implemented using reasonable means . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , collective operations are typically of the form of linear products of total spin operators @xmath38 .",
    "the third restriction requires analysis of the quantum algorithm under the presence of decoherence .",
    "for example , if the algorithm generates schrodinger cat states and stores quantum information that affects the quantum algorithm , this could adversely affect the performance .",
    "the last assumption is important from the point of view of whether a quantum algorithm has been mapped correctly with a quantum speedup .",
    "since an ensemble involves @xmath11 individual qubits , a question arises of whether we count resources on a per qubit or per ensemble basis . in our method",
    ", we take the latter approach for the reason that only collective operations are performed on the ensembles . when applying a collective operation to ensembles",
    ", we assume that it is no more difficult ( i.e. experimentally time consuming ) to perform the operation on the ensemble as compared to the qubit .",
    "for example , in the case of the optical manipulation of ref .",
    "@xcite , a raman laser pulse performs an @xmath1 rotation of the ensemble . in this case , the time required in order to rotate one qubit compared to @xmath11 qubits is the same , as the same laser pulse illuminates all atoms simultaneously .",
    "counted in this way , we consider a single gate to operate on all the qubits within an ensemble in parallel , such that gate resource counts are the same for an ensemble and a single qubit .",
    "in this section we review the deutsch - josza algorithm for qubits , which will serve to introduce our notation and highlight several aspects of the algorithm which will be useful later .",
    "in particular , we derive explicit expressions for the hamiltonian of the oracle , which plays a central role in the algorithm .    consider a function @xmath39 which takes an integer input @xmath40 $ ] and outputs a binary result @xmath41 $ ] ( see fig . [",
    "the types of functions that are allowable to two types .",
    "the first type , called `` constant '' , has an output which is constant for all @xmath42 .",
    "there are only two types of constant functions , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the second type , called `` balanced '' , has exactly half its output being 0 and the other half being 1 .",
    "there are @xmath45 such balanced functions .",
    "now consider that we are given a device , the `` oracle '' , that implements the function @xmath39 according to the above restrictions .",
    "the aim of the deutsch - jozsa algorithm is to discriminate a given function @xmath39 between the balanced and constant cases , with as few calls to the oracle as possible .",
    "classically , to make this classification with certainty , it is necessary to call the oracle more than half the number of input values , i.e. @xmath46 times .",
    "quantum mechanically , it is possible to speed this up exponentially .",
    "the oracle is implemented such that it follows a relation @xmath47 where @xmath48 $ ] and @xmath49 is the logical xor gate .",
    "the @xmath42-register consists of @xmath50 qubits in a binary representation , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b . assuming that the oracle can take a superposition of input states , then the quantum circuit fig .",
    "[ fig1]b achieves the objective with only one call of the oracle @xcite . for the case",
    "that @xmath39 is constant , the measurement yields a result with all the @xmath42-register qubits in the state @xmath17 .",
    "for @xmath39 balanced , the measurement yields a result with at least one of the @xmath51-register qubits in the state @xmath15 .",
    "we summarize the effect of the circuit fig .",
    "[ fig1]b as @xmath52 the output of the @xmath42-register unambiguously discriminates between the constant and balanced cases , which achieves the objective of the deutsch - jozsa algorithm .    in this paper",
    ", we distinguish between two modes of oracle operation : `` classical '' and `` quantum '' . when the oracle has no superposition states as its input , such as in ( [ oracleunitary ] ) , we call the oracle to be operating in `` classical '' mode . when the inputs are in a superposition state , such as that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b , we say that the oracle is operating in `` quantum '' mode .",
    "there is no difference to the operation of the oracle itself in either case  the only difference is what states are input to the oracle .      here",
    "we present a summary of the deutsch - jozsa algorithm in the eqc framework , for the benefit of readers who are not interested in following the details of the proof in the following sections .",
    "we show two methods of mapping the deutsch - jozsa algorithm , which are distinct in the way the oracle and quantum information are defined . in both cases ,",
    "the basic procedure is to follow the quantum circuit of fig . [",
    "fig1](b ) . the definition of each of the components in the circuit are however different , and are defined in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "we point out that as seen in table [ tab1 ] , all the gates performed are collective operations , involving a hamiltonian of only linear powers of total spin operators @xmath38 .",
    "the hadamard gate for eqc reads as @xmath53 which corresponds to applying a hamiltonian @xmath54 for a time @xmath55 .",
    "similarly , the measurement is in the collective basis of the eigenstates of the @xmath26 operators .",
    "this is one of the requirements of eqc , such that it can be realistically implemented experimentally .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      for @xmath56 there are 6 types of balanced oracles as shown in table [ tbl : n=2 ] . of the balanced oracles , cases 3 and 4 are",
    "most non - trivial as they have a dependence on both of the input parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 . for other cases , the functions are independent of one of the variables ( for example , @xmath59 is independent of @xmath57 ) and give simpler results .",
    "cases 3 and 4 are only different by a global negation , hence we will focus on case 4  which is the same as that examined in sec .",
    "[ qubitexamples ]  for this section .    as seen from ( [ hamexample1 ] ) and ( [ hamexample2 ] ) ,",
    "there is not a unique way to realize the oracle corresponding to this ( or any ) function . in the case",
    "that we are allowed to choose the oracle implementation , the simpler choice would be ( [ hamexample2 ] ) , which only involves linear terms in the pauli operators for the @xmath42-register . in this case we would follow the procedure in sec .",
    "[ sec : method2 ] .",
    "the hamiltonian in this case would be @xmath60 encoding the logical states as in sec .",
    "[ sec : method2encoding ] , and operating in `` classical '' mode , @xmath61 up to an irrelevant global phase . in `` quantum '' mode , the initial state evolves to @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "similar probability expressions to ( [ probdeutsch ] ) case can be evaluated .",
    "let us also take the approach of sec .",
    "[ sec : method1 ] to implement the @xmath64 deutsch - jozsa algorithm in eqc .",
    "one of the drawbacks of this method is that it generates schrodinger cat states which are vulnerable to decoherence .",
    "we calculate the performance under dephasing to analyze the sensitivity of the scheme to decoherence .    following the exact mapping procedure as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : method1 ] , and substituting ( [ evenoddmapping ] ) into ( [ hamexample1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath65 operating in `` classical '' mode , consider evolving the above hamiltonian on the state ( [ xregisterevenodd ] ) , which gives @xmath66   | 0,1 \\rangle \\rangle | k_1 k_2 \\rangle   . \\label{classicalexample}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the factor @xmath67 can be observed to be an odd integer when both @xmath68 and @xmath69 are odd or even , and is an even integer when one of @xmath68 and @xmath69 are odd .",
    "thus the same form as ( [ simplifiedclassical ] ) is obtained , where only the @xmath70 and @xmath71 cases rotate the @xmath72-ensemble : @xmath73    in `` quantum '' mode , after the hadamard gates the initial state is ( [ initialcondevenodd ] ) , which in this case we write @xmath74 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times | k_0 \\rangle_x   \\big ( | + \\rangle \\rangle   | + \\rangle \\rangle +    + | - \\rangle \\rangle   |- \\rangle \\rangle \\big ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the even and odd schrodinger cat definitions of ( [ evencat ] ) and ( [ oddcat ] ) . since @xmath75 only contains even @xmath76 fock states , and @xmath77 contains odd @xmath76 fock states , according to the same argument as ( [ classicalexample ] ) , the @xmath78 and @xmath79 terms pick up a factor of @xmath80 , while the other terms remain the same .",
    "the state thus becomes @xmath81 the above state has zero overlap with the initial state @xmath82 , which shows that in the ideal case this reproduces the deutsch - jozsa algorithm .",
    "now let us introduce decoherence in the form of dephasing , which has a master equation @xcite @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the dephasing rate . for simplicity",
    "we ignore the dephasing on the @xmath85-ensemble , as this takes a passive role operating in `` quantum '' mode .",
    "the dephasing has the effect diminishing the off - diagonal terms @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the initial state and @xmath88 .    in an experiment",
    "the observables are typically expectation values of the spin operators @xmath89 . as our aim is to distinguish between states where the state is preserved in @xmath82 ( constant functions ) and deviating from @xmath82 ( balanced functions ) ,",
    "we define a signal quantity with respect to the initial state according to @xmath90 where the expectation value is taken for the state at the end of the full gate sequence in fig . [ fig1](b ) .",
    "we can equally write the signal as @xmath91 where the state is taken to be immediately after the oracle .",
    "for the constant cases , in the ideal case @xmath92 and we obtain @xmath93 . for the balanced cases , in the ideal case , in ( [ afterhadamard ] ) all the terms give at least one spin where @xmath94 , which immediately gives @xmath95 .",
    "this quantity may thus be used to distinguish between the constant and balanced cases .",
    "let us examine what happens to the signal for each of the cases under the presence of decoherence , assumed to be present primarily during the oracle evaluation . in the constant case",
    ", @xmath82 remains unchanged due to the oracle .",
    "hence the only change that will occur to the @xmath42-register in this case is the dephasing .",
    "the initial density matrix is thus @xmath96 it is possible to evaluate exactly the time evolution under the master equation in this case , and we have @xmath97 the signal behaves as @xmath98^m \\approx 1 - \\gamma m t , \\label{fidelityconstant}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have assumed @xmath99 for simplicity .",
    "note that there is no dependence on @xmath11 for the signal , which shows that the same performance for macroscopic samples with large @xmath11 are obtained as for qubits @xmath100 .",
    "the initial decay of the signal has a characteristic time @xmath101 , which shows the signal is of the order of the dephasing time .    for the balanced cases",
    ", we expect that the emergence of schrodinger cat states will be very quickly destroyed into mixed states .",
    "for example , for an initial state such as @xmath102 , the density matrix decays as @xmath103 which have off - diagonal terms that decay very quickly .",
    "this will be true for states such as ( [ afterhadamard ] ) , which is in general an entangled state involving schrodinger cats . in these cases , we would typically obtain a mixed state with expectations @xmath104 . substituting into ( [ fidelityz ] )",
    ", we expect the signal in these cases to be @xmath105    comparing ( [ fidelityconstant ] ) and ( [ fidelitybalanced ] ) , we see that as long as @xmath106 , it is possible to clearly distinguish between the constant and balanced cases , despite the presence of decoherence .",
    "the reason for this is the fortuitous difference in the nature of the states in the balanced and constant cases . in the constant cases , the states are untouched ,",
    "hence the states remain spin coherent states , which are relatively stable states even in the presence of decoherence",
    ". meanwhile , for the balanced cases , potentially decoherence - prone schrodinger cat states are generated , which under decoherence evolve quickly to mixed states . however , since the aim is to create a different state to the initial state , this mixed state is sufficient for detection of a balanced function .",
    "thus while the decoherence indeed deteriorate the signal from the ideal value of @xmath107 to @xmath108 , it does not do so in a catastrophic way . due to the nature of the detection of the deutsch - jozsa algorithm , despite the generation of fragile schrodinger cat states , this allows for the detection to distinguish between the two cases .",
    "naturally this does not change the fact that fock states need to be prepared for method 1 , which may be difficult in practice .",
    "thus method 2 may be the approach of choice for these considerations .",
    "we have presented two methods of mapping the deutsch - jozsa algorithm , as originally formulated for qubits , onto implementations using ensembles of qubits .",
    "we follow the eqc framework developed previously such that only hamiltonians involving linear products of total spin operators are used , and collective measurements are made . in either of the two methods ,",
    "the number of times the oracle needs to be executed is one , precisely the same as for the qubit case .",
    "this provides an exponential quantum speedup over the classical case where at least half the input combinations must be tested . the resource counts for the remaining part of the deutsch - jozsa algorithm is also the same , counting the resource for executing a hadamard gate the same as for a qubit and ensemble .    the two methods presented provide two different encodings for storing qubit information . in method 1 ,",
    "the binary information is stored as the parity of the fock states .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that it can map an arbitrary deutsch - jozsa oracle onto the eqc framework .",
    "the deutsch - jozsa oracle can be implemented using an infinite number of different hamiltonians , and the approach is suitable if this generality is required in the mapping .",
    "the drawback of method 1 is that schrodinger cat states are generated by the oracle , which are prone to decoherence .",
    "however , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : decoherence ] , due to the nature of the measurement discrimination between constant and balanced cases , in practice a clear signal difference should nevertheless be obtained between the two cases .",
    "the reason for this is that to distinguish between the two cases , all that is required is a significant deviation from the initial state in the balanced case , which is realized even when decoherence is present .    in method 2 ,",
    "an encoding corresponding to orthogonal spin coherent states on the bloch sphere was used .",
    "this encoding can not map all qubit oracle realizations , hence does not have the generality of method 1 .",
    "it nonetheless can realize any of the @xmath109 balanced and the two constant functions .",
    "hence the reduction in generality is only in the degrees of freedom allowed in the oracle realization , and not a restriction of the algorithm itself . in this case",
    ", the algorithm works only to finite probability , hence is an approximation to the qubit case . while approximate , the dominant errors are exponentially suppressed @xmath110 , hence in practice the errors are negligible for large ensemble sizes .",
    "this paper has shown that it is possible to perform the deutsch - jozsa using macroscopic ensembles under the practical restrictions imposed by eqc .",
    "this joins the other quantum algorithms that are possible under eqc , namely quantum teleportation @xcite and deutsch s algorithm @xcite .",
    "our results also reproduce the results already found for deutsch s algorithm under a more general setting . in the current work ,",
    "our aim was simply to reproduce the results of the qubit version of the algorithm faithfully .",
    "one advantage of using ensembles is that it is possible  unlike qubits  to read out using non - destructive means the state of a spin coherent state @xcite .",
    "such features are not utilized in this or the other quantum algorithms that have been mapped successfully from qubits .",
    "utlizing such non - destructive measurements has the potential to lead to other quantum algorithms in eqc that are not possible with qubits .",
