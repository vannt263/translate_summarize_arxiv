    "within the su(3 ) quark model , the @xmath0 meson has the composition @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the singlet and octet representations . for a deviation by @xmath6 from ideal",
    "mixing with @xmath7 @xcite the weight of the @xmath8 component in the @xmath0 is still 0.998 , i.e.  it consists exceedingly of hidden strangeness .",
    "the branching ratio for @xmath9 is 0.491 ; via this decay channel the @xmath0 is accessible e.g.  in the fopi and hades detectors .",
    "the electromagnetic decay branching @xmath10 is @xmath11 thus allowing @xmath0 identification with hades .",
    "the narrow vacuum width of 4.43 mev makes the @xmath0 meson an ideal object of in - medium hadron spectroscopy in strongly interacting matter since any mass shift should become clearly visible , in contrast to the wide @xmath12 meson .",
    "since the mass of the @xmath0 meson is only 32 mev above the @xmath1 threshold a substantial coupling of the @xmath0 and @xmath13 dynamics is to be expected . due to this reason",
    "an understanding of the role of the @xmath0 meson in intermediate - energy heavy - ion collisions is highly desirable .",
    "it is the aim of this contribution to summarize the present experimental situation and to consider prospects for future measurements .",
    "the fopi collaboration has collected about @xmath14 central events ( 10% @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) in the reaction ni(1.93 agev ) + ni .",
    "the @xmath0 production is deeply sub - threshold , as the threshold in pp collisions is at 2.59 gev .",
    "via identified @xmath13 pairs within the acceptance region of the central drift chamber ( cdc ) original @xmath0 mesons are reconstructed @xcite .",
    "the corresponding acceptance is centered around target rapidity and restricted by angular and momentum limits @xcite .",
    "recently also @xmath13 candidates have been used to reconstruct @xmath0 mesons within the helitron acceptance at midrapidity @xcite .",
    "the statistics is still too low to obtain any distribution .",
    "rather , in both acceptance regions only the total numbers of @xmath0 mesons could be given .",
    "to accomplish an extrapolation to full phase space , the assumption of an isotropic distribution seems most natural as long as other information is not at our disposal .",
    "this assumption must be supplemented by additional information on parameters of the distribution . based on the analyses of @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 spectra @xcite an effective temperature parameter of @xmath20 mev",
    "was used in @xcite to deduce a @xmath0 production probability of @xmath21 which , with additional experimental information , resulted in a @xmath22 ratio of about 0.1 .",
    "later on , by improved analyses , both values were substantially increased @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the information of the @xmath0 yields in the cdc and helitron acceptances were combined and yielded an even larger @xmath0 multiplicity and a @xmath22 ratio in the order of unity .",
    "the consistency of the cdc and helitron data enforced a value of @xmath23 mev . in estimating the @xmath22 ratio , @xmath24 measuments at kaos @xcite and @xmath25 ratios together with @xmath26 multiplicities from fopi @xcite",
    "are employed and properly scaled ( for details cf @xcite ) .",
    "first attempts to calculate the subthreshold @xmath0 production in heavy - ion collisions have been performed by ko and collaborators within a buu transport approach @xcite .",
    "they included the channels @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath32 channel was found to be small , while the @xmath30 channel dominated .",
    "the parameterization used in @xcite for the @xmath34 reaction underestimates the later on measured near - threshold data @xcite .",
    "therefore , we performed a new transport calculation by employing the nantes iqmd code @xcite with newly parameterized elementary cross sections . within a one - boson exchange model , in @xcite the @xmath0 cross sections @xmath35 and",
    "@xmath36 have been adjusted to recent threshold - near data @xcite .",
    "the corresponding diagrams are displayed in figure [ diagrams ] .",
    "the parametrization of the channels described above as well as the other @xmath0 production channels from @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 collisions are obtained by the following formulas : @xmath37/1{\\rm gev } \\bigr)^{1.309 } \\\\ & & \\sigma(pn \\to pn \\phi ) = 41.3 \\mu\\mbox{b } \\cdot   \\bigl ( [ \\sqrt{s}-2m_n - m_\\phi]/1{\\rm gev } \\bigr)^{1.438 } \\\\ & & \\sigma(\\pi^+ n \\to p \\phi ) = 101 \\mu\\mbox{b } \\cdot   \\bigl ( [ \\sqrt{s}-m_n - m_\\phi]/1{\\rm gev } \\bigr)^{0.466 } \\\\ & & \\sigma(\\pi^+ n \\to p \\phi ) = \\sigma(\\pi^- p \\to n \\phi ) = 2 \\sigma(\\pi^0 p \\to p \\phi ) = 2\\sigma ( \\pi^0 n \\to n \\phi ) \\\\ & & \\sigma(nn \\to nn \\phi ) = \\sigma ( pp \\to pp \\phi ) , \\qquad \\sigma(\\pi\\delta \\to n \\phi ) = 0 \\\\ & & \\sigma(n\\delta\\to nn\\phi ) = 0.375   \\bigl ( \\sigma(pp \\to pp \\phi ) + \\sigma(pn \\to pn \\phi ) \\bigr ) \\\\ & & \\sigma(\\delta\\delta \\to nn\\phi ) = 0.25   \\bigl ( \\sigma ( pp \\to pp \\phi ) + \\sigma ( pn \\to pn \\phi ) \\bigr ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the resulting transverse momentum ( @xmath38 ) vs rapidity ( @xmath39 ) distribution for the reaction ni(1.93 agev ) + ni is displayed in figure [ sigma_iqmd ] .",
    "indeed , the distribution looks very isotropic , as highlighted by a comparison with the parameterization @xmath40 with @xmath41 mev ( @xmath42 is the transverse mass ) .",
    "while these calculations support the isotropy assumption made in @xcite for a @xmath43 extrapolation , the total yields remain below the preliminary experimental data .",
    "this has inspired the authors of @xcite to include in transport model calculations further elementary reactions which contribute to @xmath0 production .",
    "in particular , processes with incoming @xmath12 mesons are considered . however , despite of an increase of the @xmath0 multiplicity for the full phase space as well as for the cdc and helitron acceptance regions separately , still the experimental values are underestimated .",
    "this result calls for an explanation . in particular",
    ", the preliminary experimental ratio @xmath44 indicates that half of the @xmath24 stem from @xmath0 decays .",
    "otherwise , in many transport calculations of the @xmath24 production ( cf @xcite for a recent study ) , the @xmath0 channel is not included at all ; inclusion of the surprizingly frequent @xmath0 s would then deliver too many @xmath24 .",
    "if the ratio @xmath44 would be experimentally confirmed , then in previous experiments too few @xmath24 were seen .",
    "this appears as a puzzling situation which is caused by the restricted and partially disjunct phase space regions where the @xmath0 and @xmath24 are measured .",
    "notice in this context that hsd transport calculations for central au + au reactions @xcite give a ratio @xmath44 at beam energy of about 1.5 agev , while at 1.9 agev the ratio drops below unity .",
    "to elucidate the maximum count rates of @xmath0 mesons in future experiments we present here estimates for the symmetric reaction c(2.0 agev ) + c which are based on ( i ) the isotropic distribution in equation ( [ isotropic_source ] ) with @xmath45 mev , ( ii ) target thickness corresponding to 1% interaction probability , ( iii ) maximum beam intensities compatible with the data acquisition times and taping rates for the detector systems hades and fopi , and ( iv ) acceptance regions , efficiencies , and geometry of the detectors .",
    "the corresponding details are described in @xcite .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath46 in equation ( [ isotropic_source ] ) corresponds to a @xmath0 production probability of @xmath47 , where the first term is 0.2 from @xcite and the second one equals @xmath48 from @xcite .",
    "taking into account the corresponding branching ratios , the maximum count rates of @xmath0 mesons per day are : ( i ) 30 ( hades , @xmath2 channel , @xmath49 ) , ( ii ) 5 ( hades , @xmath1 channel , @xmath50 , and @xmath51  gev / c ) , ( iii ) 160 ( hades , @xmath1 channel , @xmath52 and @xmath51 gev / c ) , ( iv ) 50 ( fopi , @xmath1 channel , detector combination of cdc and upgraded barrel : @xmath53 and 0.1  gev / c @xmath54  gev / c , combination of helitron and plastic wall : @xmath55 and 0.2  gev / c @xmath56  gev / c , as well as mixed combination of cdc and helitron ) .",
    "these numbers do not include any background estimates . while ( iii ) looks very promising",
    ", it needs an upgrade since at present both the granularity and the time - of - flight resolution within the tofino angular region @xmath57 are not sufficient for @xmath13 identification .    at hades",
    "the @xmath2 channel gives the most complete phase space distribution ( @xmath58% geometrical acceptance ) , as seen in the upper left panel of figure [ hades_fopi ] . though the @xmath13 channel is accessible with an order of magnitude lower acceptance it will still allow for reliable reconstruction of the @xmath0 distribution and the corresponding total production probability ( see upper right panel of figure [ hades_fopi ] ) .",
    "no momentum restriction is invoked in case of the leptonic decay while for the hadronic branch the @xmath59 momenta are restricted to @xmath60  gev / c for ensuring the particle identification .",
    "the corresponding cut squeezes the covered phase space distributions only marginally .    at fopi the @xmath0 identification via the @xmath13 channel within the cdc / barrel acceptance",
    "gives access only to the target rapidity region ( see lower left panel of figure [ hades_fopi ] ) .",
    "the phase space coverage is enlarged hence allowing access to the region of highest phase - space density , i.e. at midrapidity and at small transverse momentum , when exploiting the helitron / plastic wall subdetector combination ( see lower right panel of figure [ hades_fopi ] ) .",
    "when combining the kaons of the helitron with the antikaons of the cdc even the intermediate region can be populated ( not displayed ) .",
    "further details of these simulations can be found in @xcite .",
    "in summary we refer to transport model calculations which underestimate the preliminary @xmath0 yields in individual phase space regions . this together with a large ratio @xmath61 points to the need of an improved understanding of the @xmath0 dynamics in intermediate - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we present a series of simulations to elucidate the prospects for dedicated @xmath0 measurements in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels at already existing facilities at sis / gsi darmstadt .",
