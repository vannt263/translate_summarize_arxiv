    "in the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions , the su@xmath6(2)@xmath7 u@xmath8(1 ) non - abelian nature of the gauge symmetry relates the trilinear and quadrilinear vertices to the universal su(2 ) gauge coupling , @xmath9 . at tree level",
    "there are only two trilinear vertices , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and four quartic vertices @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "only recently have experiments begun to test these vertices directly . at the cern and fnal @xmath16 colliders , a handful of @xmath17 events",
    "have been used to place limits on the anomalous @xmath18 and @xmath19 trilinear couplings @xcite . the lep ii @xmath20 collider will also test the trilinear vertices through the total @xmath21 cross section @xcite .",
    "however , independent tests of the _ quartic _ couplings require more complicated processes . one of the most accessible in the short term is the process @xmath22 , and it is this which provides the focus of the present study .    studying the gauge boson interactions ( of the @xmath23 boson in particular ) will help our understanding of the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "since the gauge - boson self interaction originates in the non - abelian kinetic term of the lagrangian , it is directly related to the goldstone modes and the higgs particle .",
    "the quartic couplings in particular will provide a way of testing the higgs mechanism , either verifying the local gauge invariance or signaling the existence of new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "a review of the importance of quartic couplings in probing new physics can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there is an important distinction between anomalous trilinear and genuine anomalous quartic couplings , _ i.e. _ those which give no contribution to the trilinear vertices @xcite . whereas the trilinear couplings involving @xmath23 s are essentially form factors where massive fields are integrated out at the one - loop level , the anomalous quartic couplings are contact interactions  manifestations of the exchange of heavy particles .",
    "one can therefore imagine a theory in which the trilinear couplings have their standard model values , but the quartic couplings are modified by any number of independent anomalous contact interactions .",
    "in this paper we study the effect of anomalous quartic couplings in the process @xmath24 at high energy .",
    "our work builds on and extends the analysis of @xcite , in that we investigate the collider energy and polarization dependence of the anomalous effects . in section @xmath25 we discuss the contributions of the anomalous operators in the context of @xmath18 production and in section @xmath26 the numerical results are presented .",
    "in this section we discuss the lowest dimension operators which lead to genuine quartic couplings .",
    "these operators must of course have the proper lorentz structure , and should also respect the custodial su(2 ) symmetry in order to evade experimental bounds on the @xmath27 parameter @xcite .",
    "the phenomenological lagrangian should also respect the full u(1 ) gauge invariance , as at least one of the fields is a photon . for simplicity ,",
    "we restrict the study to @xmath28- and @xmath29-conserving operators .",
    "the lowest dimension operators that satisfy the above constraints are of dimension 6 , since the u(1)@xmath30 symmetry requires derivatives @xcite .",
    "these operators can be parametrized by the exchange of a neutral scalar particle . ]",
    "are : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is an su(2 ) triplet , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the u(1)@xmath30 and the su(2 ) field strengths respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath35 is an unknown ` new - physics ' scale which , following convention , we take to be @xmath36 .",
    "the physical lagrangians are obtained when the above are written in terms of the physical fields @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the physical basis for @xmath40 and @xmath41 is obtained by the substitution @xcite @xmath42 while the physical basis for the part of @xmath43 which gives rise to quartic couplings is @xmath44     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the effective lagrangians @xmath40 and @xmath41 give rise to an anomalous @xmath45 coupling , whereas @xmath43 gives rise to an anomalous @xmath46 coupling .",
    "the corresponding feynman rules are listed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we begin this section by analysing the effect of the anomalous couplings @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 on the total @xmath18 production cross section at a @xmath50 @xmath20 collider @xcite .",
    "the anomalous cross sections are quadratic functions of the parameters @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . fig .",
    "1 shows the total cross - sections with one parameter being different from zero at any one time . in order to avoid collinear singularities caused by the massless",
    "photon the following rapidity and energy cuts are implemented @xmath51 in addition , all the initial and final particles are separated by at least @xmath52 .",
    "other parameter values are @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 . with these parameters ,",
    "the standard model total cross section ( @xmath56 ) is @xmath57 , which corresponds to a total of @xmath58 events for an integrated luminosity of @xmath59 .",
    "the two horizontal lines in fig .  1 correspond to a @xmath60 statistical variation of the standard model result , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath61 where the integrated luminosity is again taken to be @xmath62 .",
    "the @xmath60 band corresponds to the following variation in the anomalous couplings : @xmath63 indicating that the sensitivity is greatest for the @xmath64 parameter and least for the @xmath65 parameter .",
    "we next investigate the dependence of the cross sections on the photon energy .",
    "2 shows the @xmath66 distribution at @xmath67 , with the same cuts and parameters as before .",
    "2(a ) shows the distributions for @xmath68 ( standard model , solid line ) , @xmath69 ( dashed lines ) and @xmath70 ( the @xmath71 value , dotted line ) , the other anomalous couplings being set to zero .",
    "evidently the bulk of the sensitivity comes from the hard photon end of the spectrum .",
    "this is not unexpected , since the additional contributions do not give rise to infra - red singularities as @xmath72 .",
    "similar remarks apply to the other parameters .",
    "2(b ) and ( c ) show the effect on the photon energy distribution of varying @xmath73 and @xmath65 respectively .    to try and improve the sensitivity to the anomalous couplings , we consider next the helicity decomposition of the cross section . the amplitude for @xmath74 contains two different types of contribution : @xmath75-channel @xmath76 exchange and @xmath77-channel neutrino exchange .",
    "the anomalous quartic coupling contributions to @xmath78 production , however , only receive contributions from the former , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath79 .",
    "it follows that the effects will be largest in the _ positive helicity _ initial - state configuration , @xmath80 , since this receives no contribution from the ` standard model background ' neutrino - exchange diagrams .",
    "3 shows the distribution @xmath81 at @xmath50 for ( a ) the positive helicity @xmath80 cross section ( @xmath82 ) and ( b ) the negative helicity @xmath83 cross section ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "for the same variation in the @xmath85 , the effect is indeed much larger in the former .",
    "unfortunately , at these energies the positive helicity cross section is in absolute terms much smaller than the negative helicity cross section .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "4 , which shows the spin decomposition of the total @xmath78 standard model cross section as a function of @xmath86 .",
    "there is a difference of some two orders of magnitude between @xmath84 and @xmath82 .",
    "finally , we address the question of whether there is any possibility of seeing an effect in @xmath78 production at lower @xmath20 collider energies .",
    "we consider variations in @xmath64 only  similar remarks apply to the other couplings .",
    "the problem at lower energies is that phase space restricts the photon to be soft , which is where the sensitivity to the anomalous couplings is least .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "5 , which shows the ratio of @xmath87 , @xmath82 and @xmath84 for @xmath88 to that of the corresponding standard model cross section , as a function of @xmath86 , with the same photon cuts as before .",
    "below @xmath89 the effects are negligible .",
    "the increased sensitivity to @xmath64 in @xmath82 is partially offset by the much smaller cross section in this channel .",
    "taking @xmath90 for both the positive and negative helicity channels , we calculate from fig .  5 that at @xmath50 , @xmath91 gives a @xmath92 increase of @xmath84 and a @xmath93 increase of @xmath82 .",
    "the corresponding numbers for @xmath94 collisions are @xmath95 and @xmath96 respectively .    of course we do expect to obtain a handful of @xmath78 events even at lep  ii , and from these it will be possible to derive very crude limits on the anomalous quartic couplings .",

    "note the vastly expanded horizontal scale compared to fig .  1 .    in conclusion , quartic couplings can provide a window on new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "we have quantified the effect of various types of anomalous operators on the @xmath78 production cross section in @xmath20 collisions .",
    "the effects are largest in the positive helicity cross section , although this represents only a small fraction of the total cross section .",
