    "the newest challenges to galaxy formation models lie in predicting or explaining the state of galaxy assembly when the universe was in its middle ages , at only several billion years old . in field populations at these redshifts , @xmath12@xmath13 ,",
    "it is necessary to sample a large enough volume at sufficient depth to overcome biases due to cosmic variance .",
    "this is particularly true for strongly clustered galaxies , such as the population of `` extremely red objects '' ( eros ) .",
    "these have comoving correlation scales of @xmath14mpc at @xmath15 @xcite , and therefore require surveys of solid angle at least 100arcmin@xmath16 to have a variance less than @xmath17% @xcite .",
    "the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of galaxies are products of the amalgam of stellar mass functions , star formation histories , dust , and geometry , often with degeneracies ( such as in age and metallicity ) complicating interpretation .",
    "eros , by their simple optical - minus - infrared color selection , embody this degeneracy extremely well , and are known to consist of at least two distinct classes of galaxies : old , and dusty / star - forming . surveys in other wavelengths have post  facto uncovered eros , including radio @xcite , sub - mm @xcite , and both hard- and soft - x - ray surveys @xcite . each class ( and subclass ) of eros offers a potentially important datum for further unfolding and challenging galaxy formation models .",
    "currently , predictions of cdm - based semi - analytic models do not compare well against the numbers and statistics of eros as a whole @xcite .",
    "having the relative fractions and space densities of , minimally , _ morphologically_-determined early - type eros versus all eros ( e.g. @xcite ) , should improve the situation for comparisons against models .",
    "currently , there is a popular working hypothesis that some ( large ) fraction of eros ( those similar to the @xmath18 53w091 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are the ancestors of present - day elliptical galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite [ ms02 ] ; and references therein ) .",
    "conversely , many eros demonstrably host highly obscured starbursts ( e.g. the @xmath19 hr10 ; * ? ? ? * ) which could be an important component of the global luminosity density @xcite .",
    "a photometric technique has been proposed by @xcite to make broad distinctions between passive and star - forming , dusty eros .",
    "this is as yet not well - tested . a systematic morphological and photometric study of a large , homogeneously - selected sample of eros is therefore timely .    in this _ letter _",

    "photometric redshifts have been replaced with spectroscopic redshifts where possible .",

    "the @xmath45 has a fairly sharp edge at @xmath46 , a median value of @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath45 for the redder subsets are similar , but shifted to a higher median redshift , @xmath48 ( for @xmath38 ) .",
    "the study of eros has been largely motivated by their tantalizing connection with both the progenitors of present - day massive elliptical galaxies , and possibly , ultraluminous infrared galaxies .",
    "using the high - resolution acs data , it should be possible to distinguish between these extremes morphologically . with the acs @xmath7 data ,",
    "restframe morphologies longward of 4000  can be determined for redshifts @xmath49 , reducing possible morphological @xmath50-correction issues ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for most eros in this sample .",

    "is @xmath54 , for most cases the distinction between early- and non - early - types should be clear . at redshifts beyond @xmath55 ,",
    "the 4000 - break begins to shift past the @xmath7 band , and morphological @xmath50-corrections may become important .",
    "this can be solved by also examining longer - wavelength imaging ( e.g. the @xmath56arcsec - resolution isaac data in the @xmath1-band ) ; this will be done in future work .",
    "we began by exploring the galaxy morphologies with the concentration and asymmetry ( cas ) parameters of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "we found that the parameter values were fairly continuous and did not cleanly distinguish `` classes , '' which reflects the morphological richness of all types of eros .",
    "we therefore resorted to a _ visual _ classification approach , and report the range and spread of the resulting by - type cas values below .",
    "we adopt four broad morphological types : early , late , irregular , and other .",
    "the classification is based largely on the @xmath7 data , with cross - examination of the @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 imaging for the colors and multi - wavelength structure of features . since",
    "a primary goal of this work is to make a census of eros that may be present - day elliptical progenitors , we use a conservative definition for early types , excluding galaxies with any definite evidence of a prominent disk or dust - band .",
    "an isolated environment was not a requirement , so included are galaxies that are clearly interacting or merging .",
    "the late - type category consists of galaxies with some regular , disky component , independent of the bulge fraction  which can be quite large .",
    "irregular - types are the magellanic - type galaxies , whereas the other type predominantly includes low surface brightness galaxies and chain galaxies with multiple star - formation sites .",
    "two examples of each type are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : montage ] .",
    "the classifications were done independently by four authors ( sc , pe , rl , lam ) , with the consolidation done by lam .",
    "the overall agreement was very good , the greatest differences arising in the use of galaxies central concentration as a criterion for several cases of morphologically early - type galaxies . since it became apparent that many eros appear to be in dynamical disequilibrium , potentially softening the sharpness of cores , concentration as a criterion was relaxed .    for both early- and late - type eros ,",
    "the mean values and typical dispersions of the cas parameters , are @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "the irregular- and other - type eros are both less concentrated ( at @xmath59 ) and more asymmetric ( at @xmath60 ) .",
    "the full ero dataset comprises @xmath61% of all @xmath1-selected galaxies at @xmath62@xmath63 .",
    "the relative fractions of eros by morphological type are presented in table  [ tab : erofrac ] for several limiting magnitudes and color limits .",
    "we find the relative fraction of early - types does not depend strongly on the selection criteria , staying at @xmath64% of the total numbers .",
    "late - types , however , dominate the population at brighter magnitudes ( with 55% at @xmath36 , @xmath3 ) , and comprise much smaller fractions ( 23% ) at the faintest , reddest limit ( see also @xmath65-band wfpc2-based analyses by @xcite and @xcite , which find similar relative fractions ) .",
    "the redshift distributions of early- and late - types are very similar ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nzt ] ) . the combined fraction of irregular- and other - types increases dramatically with both limiting magnitude and color threshold ; these galaxies also tend to have higher photometric redshifts , with a median of @xmath66 .",
    "based on the observed redshift distributions , comoving space densities are calculated and presented in table  [ tab : erodens ] . the volume probed by the full sample is @xmath67@xmath68mpc@xmath69 , for a total comoving space density of @xmath70@xmath71mpc@xmath72 , and the cosmic variance uncertainty is therefore @xmath73% @xcite .    to explore whether there is a useful correspondence between morphological type and colors , we calculate the rest - frame sed of each ero , normalized to @xmath74 ( arbitrary units ) at 5200 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : restsed ] we plot all data points for two groupings of morphological types , with the corresponding mean `` blue '' and `` red '' seds , as described in the caption .",
    "the strong break around @xmath75  follows from the red - color selection of eros .",
    "it is interesting that the _ range _ of sed shapes is extremely similar for all eros .",
    "this is reflected also in the formal sed - fitting done for calculating photometric redshifts in @xcite .",
    "even the reddest normal starburst seds ( drawn from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are too blue to fit eros , so the eros tend strongly to be best - fit by the earliest ( elliptical ) sed templates . as seen in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : restsed ] , the empirical sed of the ultraluminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) arp220 ( as given in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is sufficiently red to match ero colors , and is coincidentally remarkably similar to the sed of an old , passively - evolved , unreddened system .",
    "many of the late - type galaxies have large bulges , and so their seds may naturally be dominated by old stellar populations .",
    "even the irregular and other morphological types alone , which may arguably be candidates for ulirgs , span the same range of sed shapes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : restsed ] .",
    "we conclude that in this wavelength - range , color information is insufficient to _ generally _ distinguish between clearly distinct morphological types of eros .",
    "samples of color - selected eros consist of several distinct galaxy types for all magnitude ranges and color - cuts .",
    "all morphological types are found over very similar redshift ranges , @xmath76 , with the more morphologically - disturbed ( irregular and other ) types tending to somewhat higher redshifts .",
    "this may be due to a combination of a morphological @xmath50-correction selection effects ( where at redshifts above @xmath55 galaxy bulges may be less apparent in the @xmath7 data ) ; and a hint of a population of real , `` train - wreck '' galaxies , seen at redshifts closer to @xmath77 . with the present data , it is not possible to distinguish between these possibilities from the photometry alone , as seen by the grossly - similar rest - frame seds of all morphological types .",
    "this does suggest that those eros that _ are _ perhaps `` dusty starbursts , '' have seds that are more similar to local ulirgs ( such as arp220 ) , rather than ( mere ) starburst galaxies .",
    "the comoving space density of morphologically early - type eros ( @xmath78 ) is quite comparable to present - day giant ellipticals , @xmath79 ( c.f .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath80 early - type galaxies identified within the ero population may in fact correspond to the majority of the most massive ellipticals today , pointing to an epoch of assembly , as well as star - formation , at redshifts well beyond @xmath81 .",
