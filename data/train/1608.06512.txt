    "a number of publications have proposed that biological tissue can be heated quickly and selectively by the use of gold nanoparticles ( gnps ) that are subjected to a strong time - harmonic electromagnetic field , _",
    "e.g. _ , at 13.56@xmath0 or in the microwave regime , where the band is chosen due to regulations , see _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "the aim is to develop a method with the potential to treat cancer .",
    "the gnps can also be used as a contrast agent for electrical impedance tomography , particularly when combined with tumour targeting @xcite .",
    "the fundamental idea relies on the fact that ligands can be attached to the gnps to target cancer cells .",
    "the rapid rate of growth of the cancer cells causes them to intake an abnormal amount of nutrients and the gnps can hence be coated with folic acid to target the bio - markers or antigens that are highly specific to the cancer cells , see _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "the aim of the radio frequency ( rf ) treatment is then to promote local cell death only in the cancer , in addition to increasing the pore size to improve delivery of large - molecule chemotherapeutic and immunotherapeutic agents .",
    "the sensitivity of the cancer cells to elevated temperatures enables the tumor growth to be slowed or stopped by transient heating to 40 - 46@xmath1 for periods of 30 minutes or more , whilst also increasing the tumor sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiotherapy @xcite .",
    "the physical explanation to the rf - heating of the gnps is not fully understood and there are many phenomenological hypotheses proposed to explain the heating @xcite .",
    "recently , it has also been questioned whether metal nanoparticles can be heated in radio frequency at all , and several authors have been unable to find neither theoretical nor experimental results to support the hypothesis , see _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite . as _",
    "e.g. _ , in @xcite , mie scattering theory in the rayleigh limit of small particles is used as an argument to support the ( negative ) experimental conclusions made in @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate the physical realizability of achieving a rf - heating in a colloidal gnp suspension , similar as in @xcite .",
    "however , instead of evaluating a particular phenomenological model for a gnp suspension in a particular lossy medium , we study the optimal absorption that can be achieved by a physically realizable passive material immersed inside any lossy medium .",
    "previously , optimal absorption has been studied mainly for a lossless exterior domain , such as in @xcite giving geometry independent absorption bounds for the plasmonic resonances in metals . in this paper , we prove that the optimal permittivity function yielding a maximal absorption inside a spherical suspension is a conjugate match with respect to the surrounding lossy material .",
    "our formulation also takes the skin effect inside the surrounding lossy material into account and we show that it is the skin effect that ultimately limits the usefulness of the local heating . the analysis is based on a canonical spherical geometry giving explicit quantitative answers that can be used as an indication towards the physical realizability of the heating . the analysis can also be used as a framework to study and evaluate any particular phenomenological parameter models such as the electrophoretic particle movement which can be described by the drude model , etc . , see _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "numerical examples are included to demonstrate the feasibility of achieving electrophoretic ( plasmonic ) resonances in the microwave regime in a case when the nanoparticle suspension is immersed in a weak electrolyte solution imitating a typical biological tissue . here",
    ", the frequency band has been chosen around 2.6@xmath2 constituting a realistic example based on recently proposed hyperthermia measurement devices and nanoparticle setups , see _",
