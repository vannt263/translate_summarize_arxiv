    "pfaffian systems arise in many applications  @xcite , including the studies of aerospace , celestial mechanics  @xcite , and statistics  @xcite .",
    "so far , the most important systems for applications are those with so - called normal crossings  @xcite .",
    "a univariate completely integrable pfaffian system with normal crossings reduces to a singular linear system of ordinary differential equations ( ods , in short ) , which have been studied extensively ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "moreover , unlike the general case of several variables considered herein , algorithms to related problems leading to the computation of formal solutions have been developed by various authors ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the maple package isolde  @xcite and mathemagix package lindalg  @xcite are dedicated to the symbolic resolution of such systems .",
    "more recently , bivariate systems were treated by the first and third author of this paper in  @xcite .",
    "this paper refines the results of the bivariate case and generalizes them to treat the more general multivariate case .    to get an intuition of the kind of systems we consider",
    ", we informally study the following simple bivariate completely integrable pfaffian system with normal crossings .",
    "a formal definition of these systems will be given in section  [ sec : prelim ] .",
    "* example 2 ) [ ex : sim ] given the following bivariate system over the ring of formal power series in @xmath0 with complex coefficients : @xmath1 we are interested in constructing the formal objects @xmath2 that satisfy the system .",
    "the existence of a fundamental matrix of solutions and its general form follows from well known theoretical results ( see corollary  [ gerardsol ] ) .",
    "the proof , however , is not constructive . for simplicity , we assume we already know that a fundamental matrix of formal solutions in our particular case is of the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a matrix with formal power series entries , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are matrices with entries in @xmath7 , and @xmath8 ,  @xmath9 are polynomials in @xmath10 , \\set c[z_2]$ ] respectively . we now want to determine @xmath11 . for this purpose ,",
    "we use the algorithm presented in  @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to compute one part of the solution by considering an associated ods in only one variable and then use this information to compute the other parts of the solution by transforming and decoupling the system into smaller and simpler systems :    * first , we construct two associated systems whose equations are derived by setting either @xmath12 or @xmath13 : @xmath14 we show in section  [ sec : invariants ] that the formal invariants @xmath15 and @xmath16 can be computed from these associated systems . via isolde or lindalg",
    "we compute @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 and   becomes @xmath20 * next , we apply the so - called eigenvalue shifting @xmath21 ( for a new unknown vector @xmath22 ) , to facilitate the next step .",
    "the shifting yields : @xmath23 * after the eigenvalue - shifting we apply another transformation that reduces the orders of the singularities in @xmath24 and @xmath25 to their minimal integer values . by setting @xmath26 where @xmath27",
    "we get : @xmath28 * finally , via some linear algebra ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 3 ) for general cases ) we compute the transformation @xmath29 and setting @xmath30 results in the system @xmath31 + we can now read off @xmath5 and @xmath6 . we collect the applied transformations and get a fundamental matrix of solutions : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    unlike this simple example",
    ", the steps of computation can be far more involved and demand multiple levels of recursion . in order to generalize this algorithm to more than two variables ,",
    "the following nontrivial questions have to be addressed :    * can the information on the formal invariants still be obtained from the associated ods systems ? * can a rank reduction algorithm be developed without relying on properties of principal ideal domains as in the univariate and bivariate case ?",
    "the results of  @xcite which have an immediate generalization to the multivariate setting are refined herein and supported by fully transparent proofs and illustrating figures ( theorem  [ exponentialpfaff ] which answers positively and unconditionally the first question , the structure of the main algorithm described in section  [ sec : outline ] , and theorem  [ moserpfaff ] ) .",
    "however , the answer to the second question is more elaborate ( see section  [ sec : rankred ] ) and requires the discussion of two problems which are not discussed in  @xcite :    * the major obstacle to a generalization of the results on the bivariate case lies in the process of finding integral relations among generators of certain modules over the ring of multivariate power series . in section  [ colpfaff ] ,",
    "we propose a solution that relaxes the condition of working over a principal ideal domain to working over local rings and show how to utilize nakayama s lemma in the formal reduction process if the modules under investigation are free .",
    "* we discuss an algorithmic difficulty which arises as not all formal power series under manipulation admit a finite representation , even if the input pfaffian system is given in a finite form ( see example  [ exm : trunc ] ) .",
    "although this problem arises in the bivariate case as well , it has not been addressed before ( neither in  @xcite nor in  @xcite ) .",
    "we provide a reasoning to check the correctness of our algorithm .",
    "we thus present the first comprehensive description of the state of the art algorithmic approach for solving completely integrable pfaffian systems with normal crossings in the multivariate setting .",
    "our investigation also involves the multivariate versions of the transformations used classically in the well - studied univariate case ( e.g. shearing transformations in section  [ shearpfaff ] , column reduction transformations in section  [ colpfaff ] , and properties of transformations in proposition  [ tform ] ) .",
    "not only does this discussion serve the manipulation of such transformations within our proposed formal reduction , but it also plays a role in future generalizations of many other algorithms available for univariate systems ( e.g. the alternative rank reduction algorithm of section  [ sec : alt ] and the notion of _ simple systems _ as suggested in the conclusion ) .",
    "this paper is divided as follows : in section  [ sec : prelim ] , we recall the basic definitions and the necessary theory for our algorithm .",
    "this includes the general form of the solutions , the notion of equivalence between systems , the classification of singularities , and a description of the necessary transformations whose generalization to the multivariate case is straightforward . in section  [ sec : outline ] , we give the general structure of our proposed algorithm which relies on two major components : the first is associating to our system a set of ods s from which its formal invariants can be efficiently derived .",
    "this is detailed in section  [ sec : invariants ] .",
    "the second component is the rank reduction which we give in section  [ sec : rankred ] . the main algorithm is then given in section  [ mainpfaff ] before concluding in section  [ conpfaff ] .",
