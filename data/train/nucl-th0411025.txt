    "few body reactions play an important role in astrophysics and cosmology . in recent years",
    "nuclear effective field theories were developed for few nucleon systems.@xcite the question we wish to address here is if astrophysical data ( in particular solar neutrino data ) can be used to constrain effective field theory description of nuclear reactions .",
    "the goal of effective field theories is to find an appropriate way to integrate over the undesired degrees of freedom .",
    "for example one may wish to write an effective theory of photon interactions by integrating over the charged elementary particles in quantum electrodynamics . to represent the photon - photon interaction",
    "one may introduce a point interaction of the photons instead of the square box diagram with four external photon lines and charged - particles circulating in the loop integral .",
    "however , such a recipe produces a divergent diagram when we go to the next order with one photon loop in the effective theory ( the equivalent diagram with two charged particle loops in the original theory , quantum electrodynamics , is normalizable ) . to circumvent this problem",
    "one introduces counter terms in the effective theory to cancel the infinities .",
    "such counter terms should of course be consistent with the symmetries of the original theory .",
    "the effective field theories can be applied to the neutrino - deuteron reactions measured at the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) @xmath1 @xmath2 at low energies below the pion threshold , the @xmath3 transition dominates these reactions and one only needs the coefficient of the two - body counter term , so called @xmath0.@xcite this term can be obtained by comparing the cross section @xmath4 with either cross sections calculated using other , more traditional , nuclear physics approaches @xcite or with direct measurements .",
    "note that once the quantity @xmath0 is determined one can easily calculate related two - body reactions such as @xmath5 the reaction in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) is impossible to measure for the very - low energies in the solar core .",
    "for that reason the process of determining @xmath0 was dubbed `` calibrating the sun '' by holstein.@xcite note that naive dimensional analysis predicts a value of @xmath6 @xmath7 when the renormalization scale is set to the muon mass . since the value of @xmath0 depends on the renormalization scale ,",
    "this dimensional estimate can not be used at lower energies .",
    "in our calculations we used the neutrino cross sections given in refs . 2 and 3 . the details of the analysis method and procedures used to calculate the measured neutrino rates and spectra are described in refs . 9 and 10 . to calculate the msw survival probabilities we used the neutrino spectra and solar electron density profile given by the standard solar model of bahcall and collaborators.@xcite in the calculations presented in this section we took the mixing angle @xmath8 to be zero .",
    "what we present below is an improved version of our analysis in ref .",
    "we calculate @xmath9 marginalized over the neutrino parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in figure",
    "[ fig : l1afin1 ] we present the quantity @xmath12 calculated as a function of @xmath13 . in this figure @xmath14",
    "is projected only on one parameter ( @xmath15 ) so that @xmath16 bounds on it are given by @xmath17 . in our global fit",
    "we used 93 data points from solar and reactor neutrino experiments ; namely the total rate of the chlorine experiment ( homestake@xcite ) , the average rate of the gallium experiments ( sage@xcite , gallex@xcite , gno@xcite ) , 44 data points from the superkamiokande ( sk ) zenith - angle - spectrum,@xcite 34 data points from the sno day - night - spectrum,@xcite the neutral current flux measurement at sno using dissolved salt@xcite and 13 data points from the kamland spectrum@xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : l1afin1 ] we show the @xmath0 values obtained using only the solar neutrino data from sno as well as various combinations of other experiments .",
    "clearly the @xmath9 minimum is almost the same in all these cases . in all these cases",
    "we obtain a best fit value of @xmath0 around 5 @xmath7 .",
    "it should be noted that one and two sigma bounds on @xmath0 get significantly reduced when , in addition to sno , one includes other solar neutrino data as well .",
    "the @xmath0 values change between 4 and 8 @xmath7 with a one - sigma error of 5 @xmath7 .",
    "the dependence of the extracted neutrino parameters on the value of @xmath13 is not very strong .",
    "we show how the neutrino parameter space changes with @xmath13 in figures [ fig : l1afin2 ] and [ fig : l1afin2b ] .",
    "the analysis presented in figure [ fig : l1afin2 ] uses only the solar neutrino data as input whereas that presented in figure [ fig : l1afin2b ] uses both the solar neutrino data and results from the kamland reactor neutrino measurements .",
    "one of the open questions in neutrino physics is understanding the role of mixing between the first and third flavor generations , @xmath8 .",
    "since both of the quantities @xmath8 and @xmath0 are rather small one can investigate if the uncertainties coming from the lack of knowledge of @xmath8 and the counter - term @xmath13 are comparable . in the limiting case of small @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which seems to be satisfied by the measured neutrino properties , it is possible to incorporate the effects of @xmath8 rather easily . in this limit the charged - current counting rate at sno",
    "can be linearized in @xmath20:@xcite @xmath21 where the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 are independent of @xmath8 .",
    "the neutral- and charged - current counting rates linearly depend on @xmath13 while elastic scattering rate does not . conversely the charged - current and elastic scattering rates linearly depend on @xmath20 while the neutral - current rate does not .",
    "we show the allowed @xmath8 and @xmath13 parameter space in figure [ fig : l1afin3 ] when @xmath11 and @xmath24 are taken to give the minimum @xmath9 values to fit the data .",
    "of course there are other experiments that limit the value of @xmath8 .",
    "the chooz@xcite and palo verde@xcite experiments limit @xmath25 to be less than 0.19 at 90% c.l . for @xmath26 ev@xmath27 .",
    "data from the k2k experiment@xcite provides a limit of @xmath28 .",
    "these limits are consistent with sk atmospheric neutrino data.@xcite we also show these bounds in figure [ fig : l1afin3 ] .",
    "note that future data from sno and kamland may further limit the value of @xmath8.@xcite",
    "several other authors tried to estimate the value of @xmath0 . using sno and sk data chen , heeger , and robertson found@xcite @xmath29 as we mentioned in the introduction",
    ", the @xmath30 fusion cross section also depends on @xmath0 .",
    "state of the art calculations of this cross section implies a value of@xcite @xmath31 in third order of power counting .",
    "( this is the same order in which the neutrino - deuteron cross - section of refs .",
    "2 and 3 are calculated ) .",
    "helioseismic observation of the pressure - mode oscillations of the sun can be used to put constraints on various inputs into the standard solar model , in particular the @xmath30 fusion cross section .",
    "helioseismology gives a limit of@xcite @xmath32 in the third order .",
    "finally one can present a constraint on @xmath33 imposed by existing reactor antineutrino - deuteron breakup data,@xcite which yields @xmath34 various values of @xmath33 we obtained using different data sets are rather comparable to the values listed above .",
    "the uncertainties in the neutrino - deuteron breakup cross - sections at low energies are dominated by the isovector axial two - body current parametrized by @xmath33 .",
    "however the contribution of the uncertainty in @xmath13 to the analysis and interpretation of the sno data is rather small.@xcite the effect of this uncertainty is even smaller than effects of a value of @xmath8 near its currently allowed maximum or than effects of possible solar density fluctuations @xcite .",
    "we would like to express our gratitude to i.h .",
    "duru and other personnel of the feza grsey institute for helping us to put together a very successful conference .",
    "we also thank the members of the international advisory committee , in particular c. johnson , for their efforts .",
