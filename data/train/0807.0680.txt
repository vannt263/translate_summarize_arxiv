    "after the discovery of extra - solar planets , the detection of a habitable , terrestrial ( rocky ) planet became a real possibility .",
    "of particular interest are planets in orbit about low - mass stars ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the lower stellar mass makes detection of lower mass planets easier and leads to habitable orbits with smaller semi - major axes ( which also increase the likelihood of detection by current technologies ) .",
    "the recent detection of putative 5 and 8 @xmath3 planets around an m star ( stellar mass @xmath5 ) ( udry 2007 ) near the circumstellar `` habitable zone '' ( hz ) ( kasting 1993 ; franck 2000 ; von bloh 2007 ; selsis 2007 ; hereafter s07 ) suggests that doppler surveys ( butler 2006 ; naef 2007 ) are becoming sensitive enough to detect terrestrial planets in the hz of low - mass stars .",
    "not surprisingly , m stars now appear to be attractive targets for detecting habitable planets ( tarter 2007 ) .",
    "the _ habitable zone _ is defined , following kasting ( 1993 ) , as the range of distances from a star at which liquid water could be stable at the surface of a planet .",
    "the definition usually implicitly assumes that the star is the main source of heat .",
    "thus , it excludes locations where other sources of heat might be available , such as moons , like jupiter s europa , where tidal heating is a major factor maintaining near - surface liquid water . in that sense , the phrase _ habitable zone _ , as usually used in astrophysics , is a misnomer .",
    "nevertheless , here we use the conventional definition , while explicitly emphasizing that life could exist outside this zone .    the detection of gl 581 c and d ( udry 2007 ) has demonstrated that planets can form near the hz of low - mass stars . for such stars",
    "the habitable zone is so close to the star that tidal effects may be important ( mardling & lin 2004 ) .",
    "tides raised between the star and planet introduce torques on the planet resulting in orbital evolution , usually decay of semi - major axis , @xmath6 , and eccentricity , @xmath7 . here",
    "we quantify the effects of tidal forces in such zones .",
    "we find that earth - sized planets with large initial eccentricities could migrate out of the hz of low - mass stars in less than 1 billion years .",
    "the proper definition of an hz is not obvious .",
    "as described in s07 , the boundaries of the hz are a complex function of both stellar and planetary properties . for any individual planet",
    ", the definitions we choose may not be appropriate .",
    "nonetheless , we will show a general trend that must be considered when assessing a planet s habitability , both in the past and in the future .",
    "we consider the evolution of terrestrial planets beginning from a location that is almost assuredly habitable to a region that is probably not habitable .",
    "we call the time to complete this traversal the `` habitable lifetime '' , @xmath8 . for relatively massive stars ( @xmath9 ) ,",
    "the hz is far enough away from the star that tides can not cause significant tidal evolution .",
    "however for planets with relatively large eccentricities ( @xmath10 ) orbiting low - mass stars ( @xmath11 ) tides can pull a planet out of the hz in less than 1 gyr .",
    "the large number of low - mass stars and significant fraction of known exoplanets with large @xmath7 suggest that tides may limit the total number of habitable planets in the galaxy .",
    "we assume that potentially habitable planets can form with a range of masses and orbits in the hz of low - mass stars ( see chambers [ 2004 ] ; raymond , quinn & lunine [ 2007 ] or lissauer [ 2007 ] for a discussion of the formation of such planets ) .",
    "of course , the formation of a planet in the hz does not mean a planet is , will be , or has been habitable .",
    "many other factors are required such as favorable composition ( lissauer 2007 ) , a thick atmosphere , substantial mass for sustained plate tectonics ( @xmath12 ) ( williams , kasting & wade 1997 ; raymond , scalo & meadows 2007 ) , which on earth drives the carbonate - silicate cycle ( walker , hays & kasting 1981 ) , and substantial water content ( raymond , quinn & lunine 2004 ) , both for life and to facilitate plate tectonics ( regenauer - lieb , yuen & barlund 2001 ) .",
    "nonetheless we will call planets `` habitable '' if their orbital properties are such that they permit water to be stable on the surface .",
    "the recently announced gl 581 system contains a planet , c , that is probably just interior to the hz ( s07 ) . in table 1",
    "we list the properties of the planets in this system ; @xmath13 is the planet mass , @xmath14 is the orbital period , @xmath6 is the semi - major axis , @xmath7 is the eccentricity , @xmath15 is the longitude of periastron , and @xmath16 is the time of periastron passage in julian days . tidal theory predicts planet c orbited with larger values of semi - major axis and eccentricity in the past .",
    "therefore it may have been habitable in the past , but tides subsequently moved the planet into an uninhabitable orbit .",
    "we find that if planet c was the only planet in the system , plausible physical properties predict it was habitable . however , when we consider constraints from the mutual interactions of the additional planets , we find that planet c has likely never been habitable .",
    "tides strong enough to induce significant orbital evolution can also heat the interior of a planet through tidal working . the same type of heating causes io s intense vulcanism ( peale , cassen & reynolds 1979 ) .",
    "therefore we might expect an increased heating rate on the planets we consider here as well . the orbital evolution we consider could also have implications for the evolution of a habitable planet s atmosphere . in some cases",
    ", the orbit - averaged flux can increase by a factor of 2 as the orbit shrinks ( assuming constant stellar luminosity ) .    in @xmath17 2 we review tidal theory ,",
    "present our definition of the hz , and describe how we determine the habitable lifetime . in @xmath17 3",
    "we present our results for hypothetical terrestrial planets .",
    "in @xmath17 4 we describe how our model applies to the gl 581 c planet .",
    "finally , in @xmath17 5 we draw our conclusions and discuss directions for future research .",
    "we evaluate the effects of tides using the classical , second order equations assembled by goldreich & soter ( 1966 ) ( see also kaula 1964 ; greenberg 1977 ) : @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath6 is semi - major axis , @xmath20 is newton s gravitational constant , @xmath13 is the mass of the planet , @xmath21 is the planet s love number , @xmath22 is the planet s tidal dissipation function , @xmath23 is the star s tidal dissipation function divided by two - thirds its love number , @xmath24 is the planet s radius , and @xmath25 is the star s radius .",
    "the first terms in these equations are due to the tide raised on the planet by the star , and the second terms are due to tides raised on the star by the planet .",
    "( [ eq : adot ]  [ eq : edot ] ) are only valid if the planet s orbital period is less than the star s rotation period , otherwise the signs of the second two terms will change . for the cases we consider ,",
    "this condition is irrelevant because the second terms of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : adot ]  [ eq : edot ] ) are 6  7 orders of magnitude smaller than the first .",
    "this difference is largely due to the mass difference between a terrestrial planet and a star .",
    "note that tidal theory predicts decay for both @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "as tides slowly change a planet s orbit , the planet may move into or out of the hz .",
    "the equations above were derived under the implicit assumption that @xmath7 values are small .",
    "here we apply them to cases that include conditions with large @xmath7 values .",
    "thus higher - order corrections may potentially be important .",
    "several models of tidal evolution that are not restricted to small values of e have been derived ( hut 1981 ; eggleton , kiseleva & hut 1998 ; mardling & lin 2002 )",
    ". however , such models must include specific assumptions about how a body responds to the ever - changing tidal potential .",
    "the tidal forcing involves components with a various frequencies , but the nature of the response of a planet or star is uncertain .",
    "it is not clear how the tidal phase lag depends on the frequency of each harmonic .",
    "this issue becomes increasingly critical when @xmath7 is large and a wide range of different comparable - amplitude frequencies are involved . for a model valid to a high order in @xmath7 ,",
    "the validity of parameterizing tidal effects through a single constant @xmath26 is questionable .",
    "moreover , tidal heating could lead to core / mantle melting and a time - dependent @xmath26 value .",
    "not enough is known about the actual response of real bodies to evaluate these higher - order effects .",
    "therefore , to the best of current knowledge , eqs .",
    "( 1  2 ) above are reasonable representations of tidal evolution .",
    "as the theory matures , the effect of higher - order terms could be included and this study should be revisited .",
    "note that the higher order theories that have been derived all predict faster evolution than eqs .",
    "( 1  2 ) ( all the higher order terms have the same sign as those in eqs . ( 1  2 ) , so their predictions for the habitable lifetime , @xmath8 , would be even shorter than those we derive below . in that sense , our approach provides a conservative estimate of the tidal effects on terrestrial planets .",
    "( [ eq : adot ]  [ eq : edot ] ) are only valid when the star s orbit - averaged torque on the planet s tidal bulge is zero .",
    "when this situation occurs , the planet is said to be `` tidally locked '' to its star . for a planet on an eccentric orbit , the torque is greatest at pericenter at which point the star is moving with an angular velocity greater than the mean motion .",
    "therefore the rotational frequency of the planet @xmath27 is larger than its orbital frequency @xmath28 ( tidal locking does not mean that one side of the planet faces the star for all times , this situation only occurs for a circular orbit ) . to second order in @xmath7",
    "these two frequencies are related by the following equation , @xmath29 ( murray & dermott 1999 ; goldreich 1966 ) .",
    "note that this equation neglects effects of a permanent quadrupole moment ( we ignore this effect as their is currently no hope of measuring it in an exoplanet ) .",
    "even for modest eccentricities , the spin and orbital frequencies can be significantly different due to the coefficient in front of the @xmath30 term .",
    "a planet with an eccentricity of 0.32 has a spin period half that of its orbital period .",
    "the time for a planet to become tidally locked is given by @xmath31 ( goldreich & soter 1966 ; rasio 1996 ) , where @xmath32 is the difference between the initial spin , and the spin given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : spinlock ] ) . for an earth - mass , terrestrial planet ( @xmath33 )",
    "planet orbiting a 0.3 @xmath34 star with @xmath35 @xmath36 au , this timescale is about @xmath37 years .",
    "we consider planets initially with much larger eccentricities , but eccentricity probably does not affect this timescale significantly ( peale 1977 ) .",
    "this time is very short compared to other timescales associated with planet formation , and we may assume the planets are tidally locked to the star as soon as they are formed .    in order to determine @xmath8 for possible planets , we consider a range of values of @xmath38 , @xmath13 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we will set @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , reasonable choices based on limited observational constraints for stars ( ogilvie & lin 2007 ; jackson , greenberg & barnes 2007 ) and the earth ( dickey 1994 ; mardling & lin 2004 ) .",
    "however , the time - averaged value of @xmath26 of the earth is probably closer to 100 ( lambeck 1977 ) , which is similar to the values of other terrestrial planets in the solar system ( yoder 1995 ) .",
    "nonetheless we choose @xmath40 to be consistent with past work ( mardling & lin 2004 ) .    from our choices of @xmath38 and @xmath13",
    "we must determine radii .",
    "for the planet , we will use the scaling relationship @xmath42 ( valencia , oconnell & sasselov 2006 ) . for",
    "the stellar radius , we use an empirical relation derived from observations of eclipsing binaries ( gorda & svechnikov 1999 ) : @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath34 are the solar radius and mass , respectively .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : rs ] ) is only valid when @xmath45 .      for circular orbits ,",
    "the hz is defined as the range of orbits in which a terrestrial planet , with an atmosphere favorable for habitability , can support liquid water on the surface ( kasting 1993 ; s07 ) .",
    "however , extra - solar planet orbits are often highly eccentric . for these orbits , williams & pollard ( 2002 ) showed that , despite large variations in surface temperature , the key for long - term climate stability is the orbit - averaged flux , @xmath46 ( williams & pollard 2002 ; adams & laughlin 2006 ) , where @xmath47 is the orbit - averaged flux and @xmath48 is the stellar luminosity .",
    "note , however , that potential water loss at periastron and potential cloud freeze - out at apoastron have not been accounted for , despite their implications for habitability .",
    "we define the eccentric habitable zone ( ehz ) as the range of orbits for which a planet receives as much flux over 1 orbit as a planet on a circular orbit in the `` classical '' hz ( kasting 1993 ; s07 ) .",
    "we must also scale the location of the ehz to the luminosity of the stars we are considering .",
    "lower mass stars have lower luminosities , and hence the ehz s are closer to the star .",
    "we therefore define the inner and outer edges of the ehz , @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( in au ) , respectively , as @xmath51 and @xmath52 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the inner and outer edges of the hz , respectively , in au , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the inner and outer edges of the hz in the solar system , respectively , in au , @xmath55 au / k , @xmath56 au / k@xmath57 , @xmath58 au / k , and @xmath59 au / k@xmath57 are empirically determined constants , @xmath60 k , and @xmath61 is the solar luminosity ( s07 ) .",

    "note that as @xmath7 changes so do the locations of @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 are therefore the key parameters in the identification of the edges of the ehz .",
    "we consider three criteria identified in s07 : 1 ) 0% cloud cover , 2 ) 50% cloud cover , and 3 ) 100% cloud cover and @xmath54 based on assumptions regarding the past and present habitability of venus and mars coupled with stellar evolution , but we will ignore those models here . ] .",

    "for the outer edge , s07 give @xmath71 and 2.4 au , for the three cloud cover models , respectively .",
    "we arbitrarily choose the 50% cloud cover case to be the limits of the ehz .",
    "this choice is the middle of the possibilities , and roughly corresponds to the cloud cover on the earth .",
    "the stellar mass is related to the luminosity in the following way , @xmath72 where @xmath73 = log@xmath74 and @xmath75 = log@xmath76 ( scalo 2007 ) . with these definitions ,",
    "we plot the shape of the ehz as a function of stellar mass and initial eccentricity , @xmath77 , in fig .",
    "[ fig : hz ] . as both @xmath77 and @xmath38 increase",
    ", the location of the ehz moves out and grows wider .",
    "if , for a certain star , @xmath63 k , we set it to 3700 k in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lin ]  [ eq : lout ] ) as done in s07 .",
    "the habitable lifetime , @xmath8 , depends on the initial orbit of a planet . rather than explore all possible orbits",
    ", we will consider one type of starting location : the inner 0% cloud cover boundary ( @xmath78 au ) .",
    "although this choice of initial condition is arbitrary , it demonstrates how tides will change the orbits , and , hence , habitability .",
    "as stated in the previous section , we consider a planet uninhabitable when it crosses the 50% cloud cover boundary ( @xmath79 au ) .",
    "we vary the planet s initial eccentricity @xmath77 and @xmath38 in increments of 0.01 and 0.01 @xmath34 , respectively , and consider four different planet masses : 5 , 1 , 0.5 , and 0.1 m@xmath80 .",
    "in order to calculate @xmath8 we numerically integrate eqs.([eq : adot ] - [ eq : edot ] ) and ( [ eq : lin ] ) with a timestep of 10,000 years .",
    "convergence tests showed that this timestep is two orders of magnitude smaller than necessary to produce reliable results .",
    "we integrate the tidal equation until either @xmath81(50% cloud cover ) or @xmath82 gyr .",
    "in this section we present results for @xmath8 as defined in @xmath17 2.3 .",
    "[ fig : thz4 ] shows contour lines of @xmath8 for planets with masses of 5 , 1 , 0.5 and 0.1 m@xmath80 .",
    "there are two prominent features in each panel .",
    "first is the abrupt change in @xmath8 from 10 gyr to less than 1 gyr between @xmath83 and 0.54 .",
    "this feature occurs because the time to circularize the orbit is less than 10 gyr .",
    "when @xmath7 reaches zero , the evolution of @xmath6 effectively stops , and the planet is stuck on one side of the boundary or the other .",
    "orbits with @xmath84 become circular with @xmath6 just larger than @xmath49 . however , when @xmath85 , the orbits circularize with @xmath6 slightly less than @xmath49 .    these different types of evolution",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : evol ] .",
    "note that the evolution of both cases is very similar , but the final relationship between @xmath6 and @xmath49 is such that one planet remains in the ehz , but the other does not .",
    "note that the ehz changes because @xmath7 is changing .",
    "the difference is therefore not due to some fundamental feature of tidal theory ( other than changes in semi - major axis become negligible for small eccentricities ) , rather our definition of the ehz leads to the different values of @xmath8 .",
    "the apparently sudden transition from long to short habitable lifetimes can be shown by considering how @xmath6 and @xmath7 are related : @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath77 are the initial values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , if the effects of the tide raised on the star by the planet is negligible ( which is the case here ) ( jackson , greenberg & barnes 2007 ) .",
    "if we assume @xmath35 ( the tidal evolution has effectively ended , and @xmath88 ) , @xmath67(50% cloud cover ) and @xmath89(0% cloud cover ) , then the value of @xmath77 that solves eq .",
    "( [ eq : ae ] ) should correspond to the critical value ( @xmath90 ) seen in fig.[fig : thz4 ] ( note that @xmath87 is also a function of @xmath77 and eq.must be solved numerically ) . in the cases we consider ,",
    "this equation is independent of mass .",
    "the values of @xmath6 and @xmath87 have the same dependence on luminosity ( and hence mass , eq . ) , and , for the stars we consider , we have set @xmath91 in order to follow the example of s07 .",
    "therefore we expect the critical value of @xmath77 to be independent of both stellar and planetary mass .",
    "solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : ae ] ) for the values of @xmath49 we have chosen , we find the critical value of @xmath77 is 0.53490 , in agreement with fig .",
    "[ fig : thz4 ] .",
    "the second feature of the contours is the downturn that occurs for @xmath92 , in other words , @xmath8 gradually increases with @xmath77 .",
    "this dependence follows from the change in the ehz at larger values of @xmath77 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hz ] . at these values",
    "not only is the ehz wider , but @xmath87 is also larger . therefore planets orbits will evolve more slowly ( note the @xmath6 dependence in eqs .",
    "[ [ eq : adot ]  [ eq : edot ] ] ) , and have further to go before they reach @xmath49(50% cloud cover ) .",
    "we also see in fig .  [",
    "fig : thz4 ] that lower mass planets tend to have longer habitable lifetimes .",
    "this relationship follows from the dependence of @xmath93 on @xmath13 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : adot ]  [ eq : edot ] ) .",
    "low - mass stars , like the ones considered here , are likely to host low - mass planets ( laughlin , bodenheimer & adams 2004 ; ida & lin 2005 ; raymond , scalo & meadows 2007 ) , and therefore disks around m stars may preferentially form planets with relatively long habitable lifetimes . however , they may not contain enough volatiles for life because the impacts that deliver them may have large enough energies that the volatiles will be lost to the planet ( lissauer 2007 )",
    ".    models of the evolution of habitable atmospheres have focused on planets with static orbits ( kasting & catling 2003 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : thz4 ] shows that such a model may be inappropriate for determining habitability and biosignatures of planets around m stars ( segura 2005 ; s07 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : flux ] we plot the orbit - averaged stellar flux for a planet with @xmath94 gyr orbiting a 0.2 @xmath34 star ( assuming the stellar luminosity is constant ) .",
    "this figure also shows how the spin frequency of the planet @xmath27 evolves relative to its mean motion @xmath28 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : spinlock ] ) .",
    "the tidally evolving planet does not orbit such that only one side faces the star until the orbit has become circular at @xmath95 gyr .",
    "note as well that there exists a family of orbits with @xmath96 gyr , about the age of the earth .",
    "therefore these calculations suggest that if a planet with the correct ingredients for life formed with that orbit , and life subsequently developed in a manner similar to the earth , that life would be eliminated by the ultimate global warming event : the passage of the planet through the inner edge of the hz due to tidal evolution .",
    "in this section we apply the ideas of @xmath17 2 to the recently announced gl 581 planetary system ( udry 2007 ) .",
    "this system contains three planets with orbits and masses listed in table 1 .",
    "planet c is probably interior to the 50% cloud cover hz , and planet d is probably exterior ( s07 ) .",
    "the age of the star is uncertain .",
    "its kinematics and metallicity suggest that it is at least a few gyr old ( bonfils 2005 ; delfosse 1998 ) , but its very low x - ray luminosity ( delfosse 1998 ) indicates it may be as old as 8  10 gyr old ( ribas , private communication ; selsis , private communication ) . we therefore tidally evolve planet c backward for 10 gyr by changing the signs of eqs .",

    "the current values of @xmath21 and @xmath26 for the earth are about 0.3 and 21.5 , respectively , from lunar laser ranging ( dickey 1994 ; mardling & lin 2004 ) , but over the lifetime of the earth - moon system , the @xmath26 value is probably close to 100 ( lambeck 1977 ) , similar to the value of mars ( yoder 1995 ) .",
    "the star s mass , radius , luminosity and effective temperature are @xmath100 and 3200 k , respectively ( bonfils 2005 ) .",
    "planet c is currently inside the 100% cloud cover hz , but such an atmospheric condition is unlikely ( s07 ) . we therefore seek to identify physical and orbital parameters that allow gl 581 c to have been habitable in the past , inside the 50% cloud cover hz .",
    "first we consider the effects of varying eccentricity . in fig.[fig : e ] we show how long ago gl 581 c would have been inside the 50% cloud cover hz , as a function of its current eccentricity , for 2 different , plausible values of @xmath101 , assuming @xmath41 . at low @xmath99 values ,",
    "the time is longer because tidal evolution is slower with smaller @xmath7 , while at larger values the time is longer due to the strong coupling between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and because the edge of the hz is farther out , eqs .",

    "therefore there exists a critical value of @xmath99 that minimizes the time since the planet was habitable . in this case , that value is 0.32 in which case the planet would have been inside the 50% cloud cover hz as recently as 3 gyr ago .",
    "next we consider how the planet s radius constrains past evolution . for most cases we considered , the gl 581 c planet could have been inside the 50% cloud cover hz for many gyr , assuming a system age of 10 gyr . in fig .",

    ", the planet could never have been in the 0% cloud cover hz . in this case , it is hard to imagine how @xmath101 could be so low , since the planet is most likely a `` water world '' ( raymond , quinn & lunine 2004 ; lger 2004 ) and for such a planet dissipation of tidal energy would be less efficient ( @xmath26 would be larger ) .",
    "if the system is 10 gyr old , this case predicts planet c was habitable for 8 gyr and tides would have sterilized planet c 2 gyr ago .",
    "so far we have ignored interactions between planets b and c , but as we run backwards in time , we need to remember that their mutual gravitational interactions will cause the eccentricities to oscillate on a timescale of @xmath105 years , and we must consider the possibility that as their periods change , they could hit a mean motion resonance",
    ". the first significant resonance would be the 3:1 ratio of orbital periods .",
    "if they ever crossed this resonance , the planets would have almost assuredly been captured into the resonance ( lee & peale 2002 ) .",
    "such a scenario would invalidate the conclusions of the previous section because the system is not observed to be in resonance today .",
    "planet b is also subject to tidal forces so we must account for its tidal evolution .",
    "currently its outer 3:1 resonance lies at @xmath106 au , and therefore if it did not experience significant evolution , then planet c has orbited inside that distance since the system formed .",
    "if , however , planet b experienced significant tidal evolution , then both planets could have migrated such that the 3:1 was always instantaneously beyond the orbit of planet c. the value of @xmath107 is unknown for the neptune - mass planet .",
    "if the planet is gaseous ( @xmath108 ) , then @xmath109 ( jackson , greenberg & barnes 2007 ) , but if it is terrestrial , then the value is probably closer to 100 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : qb ] we plot the evolution of @xmath110 and @xmath111 for values of @xmath112 between @xmath113 and @xmath37 .",
    "we assume the planet has the same bulk density as neptune , and therefore the radius of @xmath114 .",
    "this choice is somewhat arbitrary , but is consistent with the radius of the neptune - mass planet gj 436 ( gillon 2007 ; deming 2007 ) .",
    "the evolution depends strongly on @xmath112 , and in order for planet c to have been habitable and avoided the 3:1 resonance , then @xmath115 .",
    "in fact , @xmath112 must be less than @xmath116 in order to avoid the 3:1 resonance , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3_1 ] .",
    "this figure plots the evolutions of b and c ( without mutual interactions , and @xmath117 ) , and the instantaneous 3:1 resonance of planet b. we see that in this case planet c just misses the 3:1 resonance .    to this point",
    ", we have not considered the secular interactions between the planets .",
    "secular interactions cause the eccentricities and orientations of the orbits to oscillate with time ( see barnes & greenberg [ 2006 ] for a review of secular theory ) . in fig.[fig : secular ] we show the secular interactions for the currently observed system , excluding planet d. this simulation was performed with hnbody , and includes general relativistic effects .",
    "our integration reveals that the current values of the eccentricities are near their extrema .",
    "we presume that using the observed values provides a reasonable estimate of the tidal evolution , however we may be overestimating the tidal effects on planet c , and underestimating the tidal effects on planet b. a more sophisticated treatment that combines the secular and tidal evolutions was beyond the scope of this investigation ( see @xmath17 5 ) .",
    "tidal theory predicts the eccentricities would be larger in the past .",
    "the amplitude of the eccentricity oscillations ( due to gravitational interactions between planets ) scales with @xmath7 ( among other quantities ) , and eccentricity oscillations would therefore have been larger in the past .",
    "larger eccentricity values can often lead to dynamical instability ( barnes & quinn 2004 ; barnes & greenberg 2007 ) .",
    "therefore we also require that the mutual , tidal evolutions of planets b and c predict dynamically stable orbits .",
    "such a consideration shows that if @xmath101 is small enough to exclude a 3:1 resonance capture ( @xmath118 ) , then the orbits of planets b and c would have been unstable 10 gyr ago .",
    "this instability arises from the large @xmath7 values the planets had then ( @xmath119 ) .    even if we begin the backward integration with the two planet s average eccentricity ( over the secular cycle ) , planet c was probably not habitable .",
    "planet c s average eccentricity is lower than its observed value , and it has probably experienced less tidal evolution than predicted above .",
    "therefore it is unlikely it could have ever been inside the 50% cloud cover ehz . on the other hand ,",
    "b s average eccentricity is larger than the current value , and its tidal evolution would have probably been more significant . in that case , tidal evolution is more likely to predict dynamical instability . we conclude that the requirements that planets b and c avoid the 3:1 resonance and be stable at all times can not be satisfied if @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "however , if the two planets have properties similar to analogous bodies in the solar system , then the system would have been stable , and never in a 3:1 resonance . in fig.[fig : bestrewind ] we show the evolution of the 2 planets assuming the inner planet is neptune - like ( @xmath122 ) , and planet c is a typical terrestrial planet ( @xmath123 ) ( yoder 1995 ) . in this case , the 3:1 resonance crossing occurred nearly 10 gyr ago , and the system 10 gyr ago is stable ( assuming low amplitude apsidal libration ) .",
    "this scenario invokes the simplest assumptions , and is therefore the preferable explanation .",
    "we conclude that gl 581 c is probably a terrestrial planet with @xmath124 , but was never inside the 50% cloud cover ehz .",
    "the detection of a terrestrial planet around a low - mass star is insufficient to determine that planet s past and future habitability .",
    "the tidal forces between planet and star can significantly change the orbits , and hence limit the habitable lifetime .",
    "planets detected in the hz with large eccentricities may be bound for hotter temperatures and ultimately a global extinction . on the other hand ,",
    "planets detected interior to the hz may have been habitable in the past .",
    "gl 581 c was most likely not habitable in the past , but @xmath17 4.1 shows that if its companion planets were on different orbits , past habitability would have been possible .    for plausible physical and orbital properties of hypothetical terrestrial planets",
    ", tides may evolve the planets orbits past the inner edge of the hz over a timescale comparable to the age of the earth . therefore in order for planets to be habitable long enough for complex life to develop , they must form with eccentricities low enough that tides do nt eventually make them inhospitable to life .",
    "alternatively planets that form beyond @xmath50 may evolve into the habitable zone , but the `` flux '' of planets out , through the inner edge of the ehz , is larger than that of planets in , through the outer edge , because of the very steep dependence of @xmath93 on @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , on average and assuming uniform distribution in @xmath6 , tides tend to reduce the total number of habitable planets around m stars in the galaxy .",
    "our work has shown that tides may shorten habitable lifetimes of planets that form with eccentricities larger than about 0.5 .",
    "although the formation mechanism of such planets is unknown , the existence of giant planets with such eccentricities suggests even terrestrial - sized planets may form with similar values .",
    "however , the majority of known exoplanets probably formed with eccentricities below 0.5 ( see , jackson , greenberg & barnes 2007 ) , thus most habitable lifetimes will not be significantly shortened due to tides .",
    "this work predicts that the vast majority of terrestrial planets in hzs around low - mass stars ( @xmath125 ) will be detected on nearly circular orbits because the time to circularize the orbit is less than 1 gyr , fig .",
    "[ fig : evol ] . should space - based transit missions like corot and kepler find terrestrial planets on non - circular orbits around old ( more than a few gyr ) , low - mass stars ( @xmath126 ) in small orbits ( @xmath127 au ) , then that system is likely to contain additional companions ( mardling & lin 2004 ) which pump up eccentricities due to mutual interactions .",
    "the increasing stellar flux on a planet due to orbital decay could impact its atmospheric conditions and composition .",
    "previous models of habitable atmospheres have considered planets at a single semi - major axis value ( kasting 1993 ; kasting & catling 2003 ; segura 2005 ; tinetti , rashby & yung 2006 ; kiang 2007 ) .",
    "the tidal change in the orbit of a habitable planet may affect the relative abundances of biosignatures , such as the simultaneous presence of oxygen and methane ( sagan 1993 ) .",
    "future work on the evolution of a habitable atmosphere and the identification of biosignatures should consider the change in stellar flux due to tidal evolution .    when a planet is detected such that it was most likely in the hz in the past",
    ", it would be interesting to determine if it did , in fact , support life in the past . in the foreseeable future , such a determination will have to be made through analysis of disk - averaged spectra of planets ( tinetti 2006 ; tinetti , rashby & yung 2006 ; kaltenegger , traub & jucks 2007 ) .",
    "future work on the evolution of habitable atmospheres should explore the possibility of detecting signatures of extinct life on planets around m stars .",
    "future work should also address the determination of habitable lifetimes in multiple planet systems as well as incorporate higher order corrections to the tidal equations .",
    "such improvements will require substantial advancement in our understanding of the deformations of solid and gaseous bodies due to tides .",
    "the gl 581 systems demonstrates the need to develop a theory that describes two tidally damped orbits that also experience significant mutual interactions ( note that mardling [ 2007 ] has derived expressions for systems in which 1 planet experiences tidal evolution ) .",
    "however , the results of @xmath17 4.2 suggest that such improvements are unlikely to change our assessment for the gl 581 system .",
    "planets with masses @xmath128 are likely too small to support plate tectonics , which are thought to be necessary for life ( williams , kasting & wade 1997 ; raymond , scalo & meadows 2007 ) .",
    "this work suggests some of these smaller planets may be heated internally by tides , such as in the galilean satellites ( peale , cassen & reynolds 1979 ) . in some cases ,",
    "in which @xmath8 is long enough for life to develop , the tidal working of the body may supply enough heat to drive plate tectonics after radiogenic heating has become negligible .",
    "therefore these low - mass planets , previously thought to be uninhabitable , may , in fact , be good locations for life .",
    "future work should explore this possibility .",
    "perhaps the most distressing aspect of this work ( from a seti perspective ) is the prediction that planets can be habitable long enough for complex life to develop , but then that life is extinguished by tides . yet this work suggests that such a `` tidal extinction '' may occur on some planets around low - mass stars .",
    "the results presented here may have significant implications in the context of the gaia hypothesis ( lovelock & margulis 1974 ) , which proposes that biology can change the physical conditions on a planet , such as its atmosphere , so as to promote the continuing existence of life . in other words , evolution favors organisms that help maintain a habitable environment . according to that hypothesis",
    ", an inhabited planet may avert a tidal extinction due to its organisms developing adaptations that not only change themselves , but also change the atmosphere such that the sterilizing effects of increased stellar radiation are mitigated .",
    "therefore the gaia hypothesis predicts that we may observe biosignatures on planets that are on orbits interior to the nominal hz , if they were formerly in the hz . in that case",
    "we might need to refine the definition of the hz into two branches : the `` physical '' hz ( the definition proposed by kasting , whitmire & reynolds [ 1993 ] that applies to planets before life gains a foothold ) , and the `` biologically - extended '' hz ( a larger region in which evolved life can stave off sterilization ) . for example , planet gl 581 c was probably never in the physical hz , but if it once had been , then it might have remained habitable even after reaching its current orbit , according to the gaia hypothesis .",
    "the detection of other similar new planets may provide observational tests of the gaia hypothesis .",
    "the detection of such a planet would be a landmark event , not only in the detection of life beyond the solar system , but because it will reveal fundamental features of life , evolution , and planetary habitability .",
    "we conclude that tides can move habitable planets into non - habitable orbits and described how this phenomenon is relevant for astrobiological models .",
