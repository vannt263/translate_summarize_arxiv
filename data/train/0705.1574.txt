    "a new framework for quantum error correction was derived in @xcite through a heisenberg picture reformulation of the schrdinger approach to error correction , and an expansion of the notion of a quantum code to allow for codes determined by algebras generated by observables . as the approach generalizes standard quantum error correction ( qec ) @xcite and operator quantum error correction ( oqec ) @xcite",
    ", we called the resulting theory `` operator algebra quantum error correction '' ( oaqec ) . an important feature of oaqec is that it provides a formalism for the correction of hybrid quantum - classical information @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we provide proofs for the results stated in @xcite , and we establish a number of new results .",
    "in addition , we expose some of the finer points of the theory with discussions and several examples .",
    "we also outline how the theory can be extended to the case of operator spaces generated by observables and general positive operator - valued measures ( povms ) .",
    "we continue below by establishing notation and describing requisite preliminary notions . in the next section we present a detailed analysis of passive quantum error correction within the oaqec framework .",
    "the subsequent section does the same for active quantum error correction .",
    "this is followed by an expanded discussion of the application to information flow from @xcite , and we conclude with a section on the operator space and povm extension .      given a ( finite - dimensional ) hilbert space @xmath0 , we let @xmath1 be the set of operators on @xmath0 and let @xmath2 be the set of density operators on @xmath0 .",
    "we shall write @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 for density operators and @xmath6 , @xmath7 , etc , for general operators .",
    "the identity operator will be written as @xmath8 .",
    "noise models in quantum computing are described ( in the schrdinger picture ) by completely positive trace - preserving ( cptp ) maps @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "we shall use the term _ quantum channel _ to describe such maps .",
    "every map @xmath10 has an operator - sum representation @xmath11 , where the operators @xmath12 are called the _ operation elements _ or _ noise operators _ for @xmath10 .",
    "the hilbert - schmidt dual map @xmath13 describes the corresponding evolution of observables in the heisenberg picture .",
    "a set of operation elements for @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 .",
    "trace preservation of @xmath10 is equivalent to the requirement that @xmath13 is _ unital _ ; that is , @xmath15 .",
    "a quantum system @xmath16 ( or @xmath17 ) is a subsystem of @xmath0 if @xmath0 decomposes as @xmath18 .",
    "subspaces of @xmath0 can clearly be identified as subsystems @xmath16 with one - dimensional ancilla ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "an algebra @xmath20 of operators on @xmath0 that is closed under hermitian conjugation is called a ( finite - dimensional ) c@xmath21-algebra , what we will simply refer to as an `` algebra '' .",
    "algebras of observables play a key role in quantum mechanics @xcite and recently it has been shown that they can be used to encode hybrid quantum - classical information @xcite .",
    "below we shall discuss further the physical motivation for considering algebras in the present setting .",
    "mathematically , finite - dimensional c@xmath21-algebras have a tight structure theory that derives from their associated representation theory @xcite .",
    "in particular , there is a decomposition of @xmath0 into subsystems @xmath22 such that with respect to this decomposition the algebra is given by @xmath23 \\,\\ , \\bigoplus \\,\\ , 0_{\\mathcal k}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the algebras @xmath24",
    "are referred to as the `` simple '' sectors of @xmath20 .",
    "we shall write @xmath25 for the set of @xmath26 complex matrices , and identify @xmath25 with the matrix representations for elements of @xmath27 when @xmath28 and an orthonormal basis for @xmath16 is fixed .",
    "as the terminology suggests , the existence of a passive code for a given noise model implies that no active operation is required ( beyond decoding ) to recover quantum information encoded therein .",
    "mathematically , it is quite rare for a generic channel to have passive codes .",
    "however , many of the naturally arising physical noise models include symmetries that do allow for such codes @xcite .",
    "the following is the standard definition of a noiseless subsystem ( and decoherence - free subspace when @xmath19 ) in the schrdinger picture .",
    "suppose we have a decomposition of the hilbert space @xmath0 as @xmath29 . as a notational convenience , we shall write @xmath30 for the operator on @xmath0 defined by @xmath31 .    [ nsdefn ] we say that @xmath16 is a noiseless ( or decoherence - free ) subsystem for @xmath32 if for all @xmath33 and @xmath34 there exists @xmath35 such that @xmath36    the `` decoherence - free '' terminology is usually reserved for subspaces ( when @xmath19 ) .",
    "the following theorem gives an equivalent formulation of this definition in the heisenberg picture , that is in terms of the evolution of observables , given by the dual channel @xmath37 .",
    "we introduce the projector @xmath38 of @xmath0 onto the subspace @xmath39 .",
    "[ nsthm ] @xmath16 is a noiseless subsystem for @xmath10 if and only if @xmath40 for all operators @xmath41    * proof .  *",

    "it follows that @xmath45 for all @xmath46 .",
    "reciprocally , if we assume eq .",
    "( [ ns ] ) to be true for all @xmath47 , then for all @xmath48 we have @xmath49 where we have freely used the facts @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "since the above equation is true for all @xmath6 , we have @xmath52 for all @xmath53 , which was shown in @xcite to be equivalent to the definition of @xmath16 being a noiseless subsystem for @xmath10 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ ns ] ) can be satisfied even if part of an observable @xmath54 spills outside of the subspace @xmath55 under the action of @xmath13 .",
    "the projectors @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ ns ] ) show that the noiseless subsystem condition in the heisenberg picture is only concerned with the `` matrix corner '' of @xmath56 partitioned by @xmath38 .    in some cases the equivalence of eq .",
    "( [ nseqn ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ ns ] ) can be seen from a different perspective . for a bistochastic or unital channel ( those for which @xmath57 )",
    ", the dual @xmath13 is also a channel .",
    "then structural results for unital channels from @xcite can be used to give an alternate realization of this equivalence , and passive codes may be computed directly from the commutant of the operation elements for @xmath10 . the simplest case would be for `` self - dual '' channels , those for which @xmath58 . clearly , any @xmath10 with hermitian operation elements is self - dual .",
    "in particular , self - dual channels include all pauli noise models , which are channels with operation elements belonging to the pauli group , the group generated by tensor products of unitary pauli operators @xmath6 , @xmath59 @xmath60 .    as a further illustrative ( non - unital ) example , consider the single - qubit spontaneous emission channel @xcite given by @xmath61 . here @xmath62 .",
    "this channel is implemented by operation elements @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "hence the dual channel is given by @xmath65 .",
    "the subspace @xmath16 spanned by the ground state @xmath66 is a decoherence - free subspace for @xmath10 ( though it can not be used to encode quantum information since @xmath67 ) . in this case , eq .",
    "( [ ns ] ) is equivalent to the statement @xmath68 , which may be readily verified .",
    "one can consider more general spontaneous emission channels with non - trivial decoherence - free subspaces .",
    "for instance , consider a qutrit noise model that describes spontaneous emission from the second excited state to the ground state .",
    "the corresponding channel is defined by @xmath69 , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the subspace @xmath72 is a single - qubit decoherence - free subspace for @xmath10 since @xmath73 for all @xmath74 .",
    "it is also easy to see in this case that eq .",
    "( [ ns ] ) is satisfied since @xmath75 for all @xmath76 .",
    "notice also in this example that @xmath13 can induce `` spillage '' from @xmath38 to @xmath77 .",
    "indeed , this can be seen immediately from the operator - sum representation for @xmath13 ; specifically , for all @xmath76 we have @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "a povm determined by a set of operators @xmath80 evolves via the unital cp - map @xmath37 in the heisenberg picture .",
    "if for all @xmath81 we have @xmath82 , then all the statistical information about @xmath80 has been conserved . indeed , for any initial state @xmath3",
    ", we have @xmath83 .",
    "moreover , if we have control on the initial states , an expected feature in quantum computing , we can ask which elements are conserved if the state starts in a certain subspace @xmath55 ; that is , which elements satisfy @xmath84 , or equivalently @xmath85 for all @xmath86 .",
    "this , together with the heisenberg characterization of eq .",
    "( [ ns ] ) , motivates the following definition .",
    "[ conserved ] we shall say that a set @xmath87 of operators on @xmath0 is _ conserved _ by @xmath32 for states in @xmath55 if every element of @xmath87 is conserved ; that is , if @xmath88    the focus of the present work is error correction for algebras generated by observables .",
    "let us consider in more detail the physical motivation for considering algebras . in the heisenberg picture a set of operators @xmath89 evolves according to the unital cp - map @xmath37 with elements @xmath90 instead of @xmath12 .",
    "if for all values of the label @xmath81 we have @xmath91 then all the statistical information about @xmath6 has been conserved by @xmath10 as noted above .",
    "in such a scenario we say that @xmath92 is conserved by @xmath32 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath6 defines a standard projective measurement , @xmath93 with @xmath94 for all @xmath81 , then the projectors @xmath92 linearly span the algebra they generate .",
    "hence , in this case @xmath32 conserves an entire commutative algebra . therefore ,",
    "focussing on the conservation ( and more generally correction defined later ) of sets of operators that have the structure of an algebra , apart from allowing a complete characterization , is also sufficient for the study of all the correctable _ projective _ observables .",
    "further observe that eq .",
    "( [ conservedalg ] ) applied to a set of observables that generate an ( arbitrary ) algebra gives a generalization of noiseless subsystems . indeed , by theorem  [ nsthm ] any subalgebra @xmath20 of @xmath95 for which all elements @xmath96 satisfy eq .",
    "( [ conservedalg ] ) is a direct sum of simple algebras , each of which encodes a noiseless subsystem ( when @xmath97 as in eq .",
    "( [ algeqn ] ) ) .",
    "it is also important to note that given an algebra @xmath20 conserved for states in @xmath55 ( or more generally correctable as we shall see ) quantum information can not in general be encoded into the entire subspace @xmath55 for safe recovery , but rather into subsystems of @xmath55 determined by the splitting induced from the algebra structure of @xmath20 .",
    "these points will be further expanded upon in the discussion of section  [ ss : schrodinger ] .",
    "we now establish concrete testable conditions for passive error correction .",

    "this is indeed the case . a simple way to see this is to note that if the testable conditions for conserved algebras of theorems  [ cons ] and [ cons2 ] are satisfied for @xmath178 , then they are also satisfied for @xmath239 where the operation elements of @xmath240 are linear combinations of those for @xmath10 .      in order to illustrate how oaqec generalizes oqec we restate a special case of the above results in the schrdinger picture : suppose we have a decomposition @xmath241 \\oplus \\mathcal k,\\ ] ] with @xmath38 the projector of @xmath0 onto @xmath242 .",

    "( [ heiseneqn ] ) , the formulation of eq .",
    "( [ schroeqn ] ) implicitly relies on the representation theory for finite - dimensional c@xmath21-algebras .",
    "as the representation theory for arbitrary c@xmath21-algebras is intractable , this suggests the heisenberg picture may be more appropriate for an infinite - dimensional generalization of this framework .",
    "let us consider a qubit - based class of examples to illustrate the equivalence established in theorem  [ found ] .",
    "a specific case was discussed in @xcite .",
    "suppose we have a hybrid quantum code wherein @xmath253 qubit codes @xmath254 , @xmath255 , are each labelled by a classical `` address '' @xmath256 , @xmath257 . in this case",
    "@xmath258 and the algebra is @xmath259 .",

    "in the schrdinger picture , the correction channel built in the proofs of theorems  [ found ] and [ found2 ] is equal to @xmath268 in words , one first measures the observable defined by the complete set of orthogonal projectors @xmath222 and @xmath269 .",
    "if the state is found to be in one of the subspaces @xmath222 then the oqec correction channel @xmath197 is applied to correct the corresponding subsystem of the algebra .",
    "otherwise , if the state happens to be in the subspace @xmath269 , this means that the initial state of the system was not in the code .",
    "therefore what we do in this case does not matter . in the channel @xmath165",
    "defined above , we chose for simplicity to set the state to @xmath270 .",

    "the operator @xmath276 is an isometry between the space @xmath277 and the space @xmath274 .",
    "tracing over the final state of the apparatus gives us a channel from @xmath278 to @xmath278 : @xmath279 whose dual is @xmath280     and an apparatus @xmath16 of known initial state .",
    "tracing over one of the two final system gives us one of two channels @xmath281 or @xmath282 . ]",
    "we can also trace out the final state of the system to get a channel from @xmath283 to @xmath284 : @xmath285 where @xmath286 .",

    "the channel @xmath282 is uniquely defined by @xmath281 , up to an arbitrary unitary operation on the apparatus , and is usually called the _ complementary channel _ of @xmath281 . its dual is simply @xmath287    using theorem  [ found ] , we can determine which observables have been preserved by either @xmath281 or @xmath282 , irrespectively of the system s initial state .",
    "the answers are given by two subalgebras of @xmath283 : respectively @xmath288 and @xmath289 .",
    "the algebra @xmath288 characterizes the information about the system s initial state which has been preserved by the system s evolution , and @xmath289 characterizes the information about the system s initial state which has been transferred to the environment .",
    "those algebras can be expressed in terms of the elements of one of the channels .",
    "for instance , if @xmath12 are elements for @xmath281 , then @xmath276 can be expressed as @xmath290 for some orthonormal set of vectors @xmath291 of @xmath292 .",
    "hence for any choice of a basis @xmath293 of @xmath277 we obtain a family of elements for the channel @xmath282 , namely @xmath294 this means that the relevant operators entering theorem  [ found ] for the second channel are @xmath295 note that the operators @xmath296 form a basis for the whole operator algebra @xmath283 .",
    "hence the observables correctable for the apparatus form the algebra @xmath297 : the algebra of operators commuting with all operators in the range of @xmath298 .",
    "hence we see that a direct consequence of theorem  [ found ] is that in an open dynamics defined by a channel @xmath32 , full information about a projective observable can escape the system if and only if it commutes with the range of the dual map @xmath37 , which is the set of observables with first moment information conserved by @xmath32 .",
    "this generalizes results in @xcite .",
    "we can characterize the observables representing information which has been `` duplicated '' between the system and the apparatus .",
    "they form the intersection @xmath299 from the correctability of @xmath288 ( eq .  ( [ heiseneqn ] ) )",
    "we have that @xmath300 , from which it follows that @xmath301 . hence , the algebra of duplicated observables is @xmath302 , where @xmath303 is the center of @xmath304 : those elements of the algebra which commute with all other elements . in particular ,",
    "the duplicated algebra @xmath305 is _",
    "commutative_. note that the contrary would have violated the no - cloning theorem after correction of both channels .",
    "since the algebra @xmath305 is commutative , it is generated by a single projective observable which can be represented by a self - adjoint operator @xmath306 .",
    "given that , after the interaction , both the system and the apparatus contain information about the same observable @xmath306 on the initial state of the system , we may expect that they are correlated .",
    "let @xmath307 be the projectors on the eigenspaces of @xmath306 .",
    "there exists a povm with elements @xmath308 on the system as well as a povm @xmath309 on the apparatus such that @xmath310 note that if @xmath311 and @xmath312 are correction channels for @xmath281 and respectively @xmath282 , then @xmath313 and @xmath314 .",
    "we will show that the observables @xmath308 and @xmath309 are correlated .",
    "first note that @xmath315 , which we can also write @xmath316 this means that when @xmath317 , @xmath318 , which can be seen by expending @xmath319 in terms of eigenvectors . also since @xmath320 , then @xmath321 .",
    "the same argument is true also for @xmath322 .",
    "therefore @xmath323 .",
    "hence @xmath324 which means that for any state @xmath3 of the system @xmath325 hence the probability that the outcome of a measurement of @xmath6 differs from that of @xmath7 is zero .",
    "this means that the information that the apparatus `` learns '' about the system and which is characterized by the observable @xmath306 is correlated with a property of the system after the interaction .",
    "therefore @xmath306 represents the only information that the apparatus acquires about the system and which stays pertinent through the interaction .",
    "this analysis has implication for the theory of decoherence @xcite as well as for the theory of measurements .",
    "we have shown that any interaction between a system and its environment ( which took the role of the apparatus ) automatically selects a unique observable @xmath306 as being the only _ predictive _ information about the system acquired by the environment .",
    "even though an observer who has access to the environment could learn about any observable contained in the algebra @xmath289 , only the information encoded by @xmath306 bears any information about the future state of the system .",
    "this suggests that the pointer states which characterize decoherence should not be selected only for their stability under the interaction with the environment : one should also add the requirement that they encode information that the environment learns about the system .",
    "indeed any one of those requirements taken separately does not select a single observable unambiguously , but together they do .",
    "this is a new way of solving the _ basis ambiguity _",
    "problem @xcite .",
    "in this section we discuss an extension of oaqec theory to the setting of operator spaces generated by observables .",
    "we shall leave a deeper analysis of this extension for investigation elsewhere . an _ operator space _",
    "@xcite is a linear manifold ( a subspace ) of operators inside @xmath326 .",
    "operator spaces , and their hermitian closed counterpart `` operator systems '' , have arisen recently in the study of channel capacity problems in quantum information @xcite .",
    "observe that ( by design ) definitions  [ conserved ] and [ correctable ] include the case of operator spaces and systems generated by observables , and hence these cases fit into the mathematical framework for error correction introduced here .",
    "let us describe how operator spaces physically arise in the present setting .",
    "in section [ ss : testable ] we showed how to build the correction channel for active error correction .",
    "we were free to choose what to do to the system in the case that the syndrome measurement revealed the state had not initially been in the code prior to the action of the error channel .",
    "in fact , there is an advantage in choosing to send that state back in the code , meaning that we choose the correction channel such that @xmath327 for any operator @xmath6 , which is indeed the case for the correction channel defined in theorem  [ found2 ] .",
    "consider the set of operators defined by @xmath328 this set is not an algebra in general .",
    "nevertheless , it is an operator system by the linearity and positivity of channels . if @xmath329 then there exists @xmath330 such that @xmath331 and also @xmath332 .",
    "therefore for all @xmath333 , @xmath334 hence the observables in @xmath335 are exactly corrected , and this is _ independent _ of what the initial state was .",
    "for instance , if we `` forgot '' to make sure that the initial state was in the code , we can still recover all the information , provided that we measure the observable with elements @xmath336 whenever we would have measured @xmath337 .",
    "typically this would involve measuring general ( unsharp ) povms instead of just sharp projective observables .",
    "this shows that it could be useful to consider the correction of general povms .",
    "since povm elements do not always span an algebra , this suggests that we should consider the correctability ( passive or active ) codes associated with operator systems in this way .",
    "consider the following simple example of a conserved operator space that is not an algebra .",
    "let @xmath338 be single qutrit hilbert space with computational basis @xmath339 .",
    "consider the channel @xmath10 on @xmath338 defined by its action on observables represented in this basis as follows : @xmath340_{3\\times 3 }   \\big ) \\quad = \\quad \\left [ \\begin{matrix } a_{11 } & a_{12 } & 0 \\\\ a_{21 } & a_{22 } & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{a_{11}+a_{22}}{2 } \\end{matrix } \\right].\\ ] ] observe that @xmath341 and that the range @xmath335 of @xmath13 coincides with its fixed point set ; @xmath342 .",
    "thus , the operator system @xmath335 is conserved by @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , @xmath335 is not an algebra since it is not closed under multiplication .    given results from other settings for quantum error correction , it is of course desirable to find a characterization of correction for operator spaces independent of any particular recovery operation .",
    "here we derive a necessary condition , and we leave the general question as an open problem .",
    "observe that if there exists a channel @xmath165 such that @xmath343 for all @xmath333 then , @xmath344 implies @xmath345 , since @xmath346 is a contractive map .",
    "this in turn implies that there exists @xmath347 such that @xmath348 ; namely , @xmath349 .",
    "[ prop : opspacecond ] a necessary condition for an operator space @xmath276 to be correctable on states",
    "@xmath55 for @xmath32 is that for all @xmath350 such that @xmath344 , there exists @xmath347 such that @xmath348 .",
    "this condition is also sufficient when @xmath335 is an algebra containing @xmath38 .      since @xmath351 , we know that @xmath352 is a subalgebra of @xmath335 .",
    "note it is sufficient to prove the correctability of @xmath215 .",
    "indeed , if @xmath215 is correctable then in particular @xmath38 is correctable .",
    "let @xmath231 be a correction channel for the largest correctable algebra on @xmath55 .",
    "then we have seen in the proof of theorem  [ found2 ] that the correctability of @xmath38 implies that @xmath353 for any @xmath6 . from this",
    "it follows that the correctability of @xmath215 on @xmath55 implies that of @xmath335 .",
    "let @xmath354 .",
    "suppose that @xmath355 .",

    "this result can linearly be extended to the whole of @xmath215 , since an algebra is spanned by its projectors .",
    "hence @xmath369 = 0 $ ] for all @xmath370 . from theorem  [ found2 ] this implies that @xmath371 , and therefore the algebra @xmath335 is correctable on @xmath55 .    as a final example , consider the noise model corresponding to a single random bit flip on three qubits .",
    "the noise operators are @xmath372 where @xmath308 is a pauli @xmath373 matrix on the @xmath374th qubit .",
