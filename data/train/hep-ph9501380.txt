    "the formation of topological defects in a cosmological phase transition is a basic result in particle cosmology lore @xcite .",
    "the existence of defects provides us with a powerful tool which both constrains particle theory models , such as those containing domain walls @xcite and magnetic monopoles @xcite , and solves some outstanding cosmological problems , such as the formation of structure with the use of cosmic strings @xcite .",
    "furthermore , during out - of - equilibrium phase transitions , topological defects such as interfaces ( domain walls ) are important ingredients for the dynamics of phase separation and phase coexistence .",
    "it has always been assumed that if a field theory defined in minkowski spacetime admits topological defects , the same will be true in an expanding universe , and that furthermore , there will not be any significant differences in the physical characteristics of these defects .",
    "recently , however , basu and vilenkin @xcite have shown that defects in a de sitter background can have properties that are quite different from defects in flat spacetime . in this work , we continue and extend this program by analyzing the equations of motion for a domain wall in a background friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) spacetime . we find that although these equations can not be solved analytically in general , a systematic perturbative expansion can be set up , with the small parameter @xmath7 being the ratio of the correlation length of the field to the horizon size .",
    "such a perturbative expansion arises naturally from the requirement that the width of the domain wall be much smaller than the particle horizon , to allow for kink boundary conditions within the microphysical horizon .",
    "the zeroth order solution is taken to be the standard flat spacetime domain wall configuration , except that it is a function of the _ physical _ spatial coordinate .",
    "the higher order terms in @xmath3 are then solved for in a systematic perturbative fashion .",
    "we can also analyze the de sitter case numerically ; we find that we agree with the results of basu and vilenkin concerning the fact that for sufficiently large values of @xmath3 , no wall solutions exist  when the horizon size is smaller than the domain wall width , a kink configuration can not fit in the horizon .",
    "we next perform an expansion in the physical spatial coordinate that is nonperturbative in @xmath3 , and use it to examine the behavior of the energy momentum tensor for the wall near the origin .",
    "this is of interest due to the possibility that a more natural form of inflation may occur in the core of the defect , where the field is trapped in the unstable vacuum @xcite .    in curved spacetime",
    ", renormalization arguments suggest that , in general , a coupling to the ricci scalar has to be introduced in the bare lagrangian .",
    "we find that such coupling is responsible for very remarkable effects that result in a _ change of sign _ of the stress tensor at the origin .",
    "in fact , we see that this effect can also happen in flat spacetime , if the so - called _ improved _ stress tensor @xcite is used .",
    "we derive the effective lagrangian for the fluctuations perpendicular to the wall .",
    "we find corrections beyond the `` nambu - goto '' action ( the 3-volume swept by the worldsheet of the wall ) in a consistent expansion in derivatives .",
    "we also find non - trivial contributions to the surface tension from gravitational effects .",
    "we use this effective lagrangian to address the question of whether the shape of the wall fluctuates , or whether it remains flat at long distances and long times after the formation of the defect .",
    "garriga and vilenkin @xcite have discussed this question to a certain extent , however we find that by using collective coordinates the long - wavelength fluctuations are identified with goldstone modes and the instability found by them is avoided .    in the next section we set up our ansatz and perturbation expansion .",
    "section 3 deals with the energy momentum tensor for the wall in an frw universe .",
    "we find that interesting behavior can occur by making use of the coupling @xmath8 of the field to the ricci scalar @xmath9 . in section 4 ,",
    "we analyze fluctuations of the wall .",
    "we differ from garriga and vilenkin in our treatment of translational invariance .",
    "the fact that the wall is located at a particular point along the @xmath10-axis , say , would appear to break this symmetry .",
    "however , translational invariance can be restored by use of the collective coordinate method . doing this",
    ", we arrive at a true nambu - goldstone mode for the fluctuations , as opposed to one with negative @xmath11 as found by garriga and vilenkin .",
    "several equal ( comoving ) time correlation functions that determine the behavior of the shape of the wall are computed , and we find that their spatial fall - off is much slower than in flat minkowski spacetime at long times .",
    "this leads us to the conclusion that the surface remains `` rough '' at large separations .",
    "section 5 contains our concluding remarks and some cosmological implications of our results .",
    "domain walls ( interfaces ) are field configurations with non - trivial topological boundary conditions .",
    "these boundary conditions demand that the field vary substantially within a typical spatial scale that is usually determined by the ( finite temperature ) correlation length @xmath12 , with @xmath2 the , in general temperature - dependent , effective mass of the field .    in frw cosmologies",
    "there is another important scale , the microphysical horizon size @xmath13 where @xmath1 is the hubble parameter .",
    "causality implies that the region in which the scalar field can vary appreciably must be subhorizon sized , since only then can the boundary conditions that define the wall fit inside the horizon .",
    "thus we expect that the notion of a domain wall will only make sense if @xmath14 .",
    "when @xmath15 , we expect that the domain wall profile will exhibit only small deviations from the minkowski spacetime profile .",
    "we can then study the differences in a power series expansion in @xmath16 .    consider a scalar field @xmath17 with potential @xmath18 in a frw spacetime with metric @xmath19 , and hubble parameter @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 ) . the second term couples the field to the ricci scalar @xmath22 .",

    "however , in de sitter spacetime , where @xmath3 is constant , we have an ordinary differential equation , for which we can find exact numerical solutions .",

    "our results are plotted as thin curves in fig .  1 .",

    "we see the kink has been flattened out by the effects of the cosmological expansion .",
    "the slope at the origin @xmath50 decreases with @xmath51 as shown in fig .  2 , vanishing at @xmath52 .",
    "in other words , for a topologically stable solution to exist , the horizon size must be greater than the correlation length ( by a factor of 2 ) .",
    "although a numerical solution is available in the case of de sitter , the general case is extremely difficult to analyze numerically , since we now have a non - linear partial differential equation in two variables .",

    "another linearly independent solution @xmath64 having unit wronskian with @xmath65 can be found by elementary methods : @xmath66,\\ ] ] where we have chosen this solution to vanish at the origin .",
    "finally the first order solution can be written @xmath67 where the coefficients @xmath68 have to be determined from the boundary conditions .",
    "notice that @xmath65 is symmetric whereas @xmath69 are antisymmetric functions of @xmath28 .",
    "note that @xmath64 diverges exponentially as @xmath70 . to render the solution finite and to satisfy the boundary conditions",

    "notice that the term @xmath73 represents a local translation of the wall . clearly",
    "the freedom of choice of @xmath72 reflects the underlying translational invariance .",
    "if we demand that the wall position be at the origin , we must demand that @xmath74 ; this leads to @xmath75 .",
    "thus the final solution to this order that satisfies the boundary conditions and keeps the wall centered at the origin is given by @xmath76    the results for de sitter spacetime ( @xmath77 ) are shown as thick curves in fig .  1 .",

    "3 . this approximation underestimates the distortion away from the @xmath56 kink , and does not see the singularity at @xmath79 , which is well beyond the regime of validity of the perturbative expansion in @xmath51 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the structure of the perturbative expansion persists to all orders .",
    "in fact we find that @xmath80 with the same differential operator @xmath63 as in ( [ fluct ] ) , and where the source term @xmath81 is obtained from the solutions up to order @xmath82 .",
    "clearly the same functions @xmath83 generate the solutions , as these are the two linearly independent solutions of the homogeneous differential equation @xmath84 .",

    "requires that @xmath87    the source term @xmath88 is constructed from iterations up to order @xmath89 , and for @xmath90 it is given by derivatives of the unperturbed kink solution that vanish at @xmath91 .",
    "it is straightforward to prove by induction that the source term @xmath88 is antisymmetric and vanishes exponentially as @xmath92 .",
    "therefore @xmath93 is finite to all orders .",
    "translational invariance suggests that @xmath94 as before , and the the solution to order @xmath95 is antisymmetric and this property ensures that the source term for the next order iteration is antisymmetric again .",
    "thus we are led to the conclusion that the general form of the perturbative solution is given by eq .",
    "( [ finalwall ] ) with @xmath96 replaced by @xmath88 , and the only complication in carrying out this program to any arbitrary order is to find the source term iteratively .",
    "clearly this will be a highly non - local function because of the nested integrals , and the numerical evaluation will become more cumbersome in higher orders , but in principle this scheme will yield a consistent perturbative expansion . clearly we have no way of determining the radius of convergence of such an expansion .",
    "the field configuration corresponding to a domain wall has most of the gradient and potential energy difference ( with respect to the broken symmetry vacuum ) localized in a spatial region of the order of the correlation length .",
    "most of the contribution to the energy momentum tensor , after subtracting off the vacuum value , will arise from this small region around the position of the domain wall .",
    "this motivates us to obtain the kink profile near the origin in a power - series expansion in the coordinate @xmath28 .",
    "this expansion is _ nonperturbative _ in @xmath51 .",
    "the motivation for this expansion is the following : one would eventually like to study the full system of einstein s equations and matter field in a self - consistent semiclassical manner .",
    "in particular we have in mind the question of how the presence of domain walls affect the gravitational fields . since for this task one only needs the behavior of the energy momentum tensor , and as we argued above most of the contribution to its components from a domain wall field configuration arise from a very localized region near the position of the interface , a power series expansion near the origin may capture most of the relevant physical features for an understanding of the back reaction of domain walls on the gravitational field .",
    "this argument becomes more relevant in view of the proposal of rapid inflation at the core of topological defects @xcite .",

    "we notice , however , that as @xmath100 from below , the first term dominates ( even for large @xmath28 ) and the profile flattens out to a straight line .",
    "since this expansion works best for @xmath51 close to @xmath101 , but is correct only to @xmath45 for ple , it is only useful in this case very close to the origin .    given a value for @xmath98 ( from the numerical solution ) as input , we display this series [ through @xmath102 for the de sitter spacetime ( @xmath77 ) case as the thin dot - dashed curve in fig .  1 .",
    "for @xmath103 , where the solution is very flat , the small-@xmath28 expansion is valid out to well past @xmath47 .",
    "we will use these results in the following section .",
    "we next turn to an examination of the energy momentum tensor for the domain wall profile in an frw spacetime .    in general ,",

    "its presence has two major effects : the first one is to modify the form of the energy momentum tensor , while the second is to modify the field configuration for the domain wall . unlike the analysis of the equation of motion in the previous sections , for the case of the energy momentum tensor we can no longer rescale variables to get rid of @xmath4 , since @xmath107 .",

    "expanding @xmath171 to quadratic order in the fluctuation field shows that the fluctuations are _ massless _ : @xmath172 \\left [ \\frac12 f_t^2 - \\frac{1}{2a(t)^2 }   ( f_x^2 + f_y^2 ) \\right ] \\ ; , \\label{quadratici}\\ ] ] in contrast with the results found in reference @xcite .    an important quantity that gives information about the behavior of the fluctuations of the interface is the vector normal to the interface : @xmath173 its correlation functions , to be computed below ,",
    "will give information on whether departures from a flat interface are significant .",
    "at this point we would like to compare our result with those of garriga and vilenkin .",
    "these authors found that the fluctuations perpendicular to the interface are associated with instabilities that manifest themselves as a tachyonic mass for these fluctuations . from the discussion above , we are led to conjecture that the appearance of this tachyonic mass is the result of a quantization that does _ not _ preserve translational invariance .",
    "because our procedure _ does _ preserve translational invariance but is non - covariant in the intermediate steps , a direct comparison of our results is somewhat subtle .",
    "however , we can gain some insight by trying different parametrizations of our kink - profile .",
    "consider the following the parametrization @xmath174 instead of that of equations ( [ etachi],[goch ] ) .",
    "we see that @xmath175 is _ not _ invariant under the the rigid translation @xmath176 ; instead a translation of the interface is compensated by a _ time dependent _ transformation @xmath177 . because of the time derivative terms in the original action such a transformation is not an invariance of the action , which is then changed by terms proportional to @xmath3 ( time derivatives of the scale factor ) , thus breaking translational invariance .",
    "following the same steps leading to the effective action found above , neglecting higher derivative terms , integrating by parts and rearranging terms we arrive at : @xmath178    keeping only the quadratic terms in the action we find that the fluctuation field acquires a tachyonic mass , @xmath179 .",
    "this is the same value of the mass obtained by garriga and vilenkin @xcite .",
    "thus we conjecture that the scalar field that measures departures from a flat interface introduced by garriga and vilenkin is equivalent ( at least to lowest order in derivatives ) to the scalar field @xmath180 parametrizing the fluctuations of the interface as in equations ( [ etachi2],[chibreak ] ) .",
    "as explained above , this parametrization explicitly breaks rigid translational invariance in any frw cosmology .",
    "the appearance of the mass term is understood as a consequence of this explicit breakdown of translational invariance , although this fact does not explain the tachyonic nature of the mass .",
    "thus it seems to us that there are advantages and disadvantages in both formulations . whereas the formulation of garriga and vilenkin is desirable in that it maintains explicit covariance",
    ", there is the feature of instabilities associated with the tachyonic mass of the fluctuations , which if our analysis is correct , indicates the breakdown of translational invariance in the quantization procedure . on the other hand , our formulation , in terms of collective coordinate quantization , sacrifices explicit covariance , although the final result is covariant , but explicitly treats translational invariance and its restoration via the collective coordinate quantization .",
    "the collective coordinates represent massless fields as a consequence of this translational invariance .",
    "quantizing the fluctuations of the interface allows us to answer some relevant questions about the dynamics of the interface .",
    "in particular we can answer the question that we posed at the beginning of the section that is whether the interface ( wall ) is flat or strongly fluctuating at long distances . in",
    "order to answer this question we must compute the correlation function of the vectors normal to the interface at long distances @xmath181 with @xmath182 the distance on the two - dimensional surface of the interface .    since we are interested in long distance physics , we will only consider slowly varying fluctuations of the fluctuation field @xmath183 and neglect higher derivative terms in the action , keeping only the quadratic terms ( one can be brave and pursue a perturbative expansion but we will content ourselves here with a lowest order calculation ) in the action . repeating eq .",
    "( [ quadratici ] ) , @xmath184\\left[f_{x}^{2}+f_{y}^{2}-a^{2}(t)f_{t}^{2}\\right]\\ ] ] the equations of motion for the field @xmath183 are given by : @xmath185}\\right\\}-\\frac{\\delta f}{a^2(t)}=0 \\label{eqofmotion}\\ ] ] with @xmath186 being the two - dimensional laplacian .    in the most general case ,",
    "the time dependence of the above equation is far too complicated to pursue analytically and one would have to resort to numerical integrations .",
    "thus we concentrate on the case of de sitter expansion with scale factor @xmath187 that allows an analytic treatment .",
    "the fluctuation field is expanded in terms of creation and annihilation operators and the mode functions which are solutions of the above equation of motion : @xmath188 \\label{flucexp } \\\\",
    "\\sigma   & = & \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\left[c_{0}-5c_{2}\\frac{h^2}{2}\\right ] \\label{surftens } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the `` surface tension '' @xmath189 has been absorbed in the definition of @xmath183 to make it canonical and @xmath190 is the ( comoving ) area of the ( planar ) wall .    performing the change of variables on the mode functions @xmath191",

    "although we do not have a physical criterion to pick a particular vacuum state , we will choose the bunch - davies @xcite vacuum for simplicity .",
    "such a choice implies @xmath200    without loss of generality we can take @xmath201 .",
    "finally , the field @xmath183 is expanded in creation and annihilation operators with respect to the bunch - davies vacuum state as : @xmath202\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as mentioned above , we are interested on the long - wavelength fluctuations of the interface at long distances and at long times after its formation . thus we will study the regime @xmath203 .",
    "furthermore there are physical cutoffs that we must introduce : the ( comoving ) wavelengths can not be bigger than the horizon , and because the nature of our approximation can not be shorter than the correlation length ( the expansion is in derivatives , thus valid for slowly varying fields on the scale of the correlation length ) .",
    "therefore integrals over wavevectors will be restricted to the interval @xmath204 .",
    "the fluctuation field @xmath161 measures the departure from a flat interface .",
    "thus a quantity of interest is the correlation function of the vector normal to the space - like interface .",
    "this normal vector is obtained from the induced metric _ on the two - dimensional surface _ and given by @xmath205 the equal - time two - point correlation function is given by @xmath206\\left|h^{(1)}_{2 }   \\left(\\frac{pe^{-ht}}{h}\\right)\\right|^2.\\ ] ] notice from eq .",
    "( [ normal ] ) that @xmath207 ( to the order considered ) and that the correlation function does not require any short distance subtraction .",
    "its long time , long distance behavior is found to be @xmath208 where @xmath209 stand for sub - leading terms that fall off fast at large @xmath182 .",
    "it is instructive to compare this result with that in minkowski spacetime , for which @xmath210 .",
    "clearly the interface is `` rougher '' in de sitter spacetime .",
    "the result ( [ normalcorr ] ) raises the very interesting possibility of anomalous exponents in the correlation function .",
    "notice that for large @xmath182 the logarithmic ( infrared ) singularities become strong and eventually would have to be resummed in order to obtain meaningful long distance behavior .",
    "_ assuming _ such a resummation of the lowest order result we obtain the long distance behavior : @xmath211    this result has interesting implications . in particular , we find that at long times and distances the vectors normal to the interface are uncorrelated and the interface is `` rough '' rather than approximately flat with small fluctuations that fall - off rapidly at long distances .",
    "this situation is very similar to that of the x - y model and other models in statistical mechanics in @xmath212 euclidean dimensions ( typically massless scalar field theories ) in which logarithmic singularities sum up to anomalous dimensions @xcite much in the same way .",
    "this would indeed be a tantalizing possibility that needs to be studied further , perhaps by keeping higher order terms in the effective action and resumming using renormalization group arguments .",
    "this is certainly beyond the scope of this article .",
    "another quantity of interest that measures properties of the interface is the distortion @xcite : @xmath213 ^ 2>=   2<f^2(\\vec{x},t)>-2<f(\\vec{x},t)f(\\vec{y},t)>\\ ] ] we evaluated this correlation function for large times and distances ( @xmath214 ) and found @xmath215 this result is consistent with that of the normal - normal correlation function ( [ normalcorr ] ) .",
    "this correlation function shows once again that the interface is strongly fluctuating at long distances and can not be considered flat .",
    "in this article we have focused on the properties of domain walls in general frw universes .",
    "these defects will appear during phase transitions in typical inflaton theories and ultimately drive the dynamics of the process of phase separation .",
    "they may also contribute to density fluctuations and perhaps to structure formation .",
    "our results present a rich picture of the properties of these defects . after analyzing numerically the case of de sitter spacetime and assuming that the boundary conditions on the field configuration require that the horizon size be larger than the typical correlation length we set up a systematic perturbative expansion in powers of @xmath216 and worked out in detail the first order correction from curved spacetime effects .",
    "we see then that even in situations in which the universe is expanding slowly enough to allow us to set up our perturbation theory for defects , new phenomena occurs with definite cosmological implications .",
    "in particular , we argue that in a general frw spacetime , consistency ( renormalizability ) of the theory requires a coupling to the ricci scalar . with this coupling the energy momentum tensor of defects can show some remarkable new features , including a negative energy density at the origin .",
    "clearly this observation brings interesting possibilities for topological inflation near the center of the defect that must be studied within the full set of einstein s equations in the presence of this configuration . for some values of the coupling to the ricci scalar , we find that the energy density at the center is _ lower _ than at a distance of the order of the correlation length away from the center .      using collective coordinate quantization of the fluctuations perpendicular to the wall , we obtained the effective lagrangian for these fluctuations in the long - wavelength approximation .",
    "there are several noteworthy features of this effective lagrangian : curved spacetime effects renormalize the surface tension , and we find systematic corrections to the `` nambu '' action .    we have also shown how to quantize the fluctuations about a completely flat wall , and how the collective coordinate procedure yields the expected goldstone mode associated with translational invariance .",
    "this analysis then allows us to compute correlation functions and to see that , at least in the de sitter case , fluctuations are fairly strong at long distances and long times after formation of the defect leading to conclusion that the surface tends to be rougher than in flat spacetime . these results and the method developed for the quantization of the fluctuations may yield some insight on novel mechanisms to study density perturbations .",
    "what we have done for walls can also be done for other defects , such as cosmic strings .",
    "these should exhibit some interesting behavior , especially for the fluctuations , since there will now be collective coordinates associated with the internal @xmath217 symmetry whose spontaneous breaking gives rise to the string .",
    "interesting possibilities are corrections to the string tension from curved spacetime effects and also corrections to the `` nambu - goto '' action from higher derivative terms , and perhaps novel behavior of the energy momentum tensor at the core of the defect when the coupling to the ricci scalar is introduced .",
