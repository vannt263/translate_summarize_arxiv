    "let us emphasize that while our protocol would provide this performance for any input pure state , it also provides a meaningful estimate for any input mixed state , of course , with a larger uncertainty proportional to @xmath250 .",
    "in contrast to that , the optimal joint measurement that attains the ultimate limit of would not work for mixed input states .",
    "it is known that sequential measurements when combined with self - learning adaptive strategies can come close to the quantum estimation limit @xcite .",

    "now the probability that the first qubit is detected by the @xmath111-th detector and the second by the @xmath273-th detector is @xmath281 .",
    "the resulting ml estimator is then given by @xmath282 , and upon averaging over all measurement results and all input pauli vectors we get @xmath283 which is markedly smaller than the non - adaptive value in .",

    "but , in such an adaptive scheme , after the first particle is observed , the uncertainty of the input state pauli vector orientation is still quite large , which may result in a significant misalignment in the second adaptive step .",
