    "pulsating da ( h - rich atmospheres ) white dwarfs , also called zz ceti or dav stars , are the most numerous class of degenerate pulsators , with over 148 members known today . they are characterized by multiperiodic brightness variations caused by spheroidal , non - radial @xmath1-modes of low degree with periods between 70 and 1500  s ( winget & kepler , althaus et al .",
    "g117@xmath0b15a is the most well - studied star of this class of variables .",
    "the rate of change of its 215.2  s period is very small : @xmath2 s / s ( kepler 2009 ) , with a stability comparable to that of the most stable millisecond pulsars .",
    "the _ axion _ is a hypothetical particle that appears as a consequence of the symmetry postulated by peccei & quinn ( 1977 ) to solve the strong cp ( charge - parity ) problem in quantum chromodynamics .",
    "axions are considered as candidates for dark matter of the universe , and their contribution depends on their mass ( raffelt 2007 ) .",
    "interestingly enough , axion emission is supposed to take place in the cores of white dwarfs ( isern et al .",
    "1992 , 2008 ) .",
    "since axions can freely escape from such stars , their existence would increase the cooling rate and , consequently , the rate of change of the periods as compared with the standard one . in this work we present a new asteroseismological model for g117@xmath0b15a and",
    "use the more recent measurement of the rate of change of the 215.2  s period to impose new constraints on the mass of the axion .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table1 ]    we performed a detailed asteroseismological study of the dav star g117@xmath0b15a using a grid of evolutionary models characterized by consistent chemical profiles for both the core and envelope , and covering a wide range of stellar masses , thicknesses of the hydrogen envelope and effective temperatures .",
    "this constitutes the first asteroseismological application of the da white - dwarf models presented in althaus et al .",
    "( 2010b ) .",
    "these models were generated with the lpcode evolutionary code from the zams through the thermally - pulsing and mass - loss phases on the agb and finally to the domain of planetary nebulae and white dwarfs .",
    "the effective temperature , the stellar mass and the mass of the h envelope of our da white dwarf models vary in the ranges : @xmath3 k , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , where the ranges of the values of @xmath6 are dependent on @xmath7 . for simplicity , the mass of he has been kept fixed at the value predicted by the evolutionary computations for each sequence .",
    "we searched for a pulsation model that best matches the pulsation periods of g117@xmath0b15a . to this end , we sought the model that minimizes a quality function defined simply as the average of the absolute differences between theoretical and observed periods : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the number of the periods  215.20  s , 270.46  s and 304.05  s ( kepler et al . 1982 )  observed in g117@xmath0b15a .",
    "the theoretical periods were assessed by means of the pulsation code described in crsico & althaus ( 2006 ) .",
    "we found a best - fit model with the characteristics shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the internal chemical stratification and a propagation diagram ( i.e. , the spatial run of the logarithm of the squared brunt - visl and lamb frequencies ) of this model are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "each chemical transition region produces clear and distinctive features in @xmath10 , which are eventually responsible for the mode - trapping properties of the model . in the core region , there are several peaks at @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 ) resulting from steep variations in the inner c - o profile which are caused by the occurrence of extra mixing episodes beyond the fully convective core during central helium burning .",
    "the extended bump in @xmath13 at @xmath14 is caused by the chemical transition of he , c and o resulting from nuclear processing in prior agb and thermally - pulsing agb stages .",
    "finally , there is the he / h transition region at @xmath15 , which is smoothly shaped by the action of time - dependent element diffusion .",
    "in order to compute the effects of axion emission , we adopted the axion emission rates of nakagawa et al .",
    "axion emission produces a supplementary energy loss rate to those normally considered in the standard theory of white dwarf evolution . as a result",
    ", axions accelerate the cooling process of white dwarfs .",
    "such an acceleration of the evolution has a direct consequence on the pulsational properties of the star , because it produces a larger value of the period derivative of the oscillation modes , @xmath16 ( isern et al .",
    "1992 ) . due to this extra cooling mechanism ,",
    "the structure of the white dwarf itself is also affected but , fortunately , in such a way that for a fixed @xmath17 the pulsation periods @xmath18 are largely independent of the exact value of the axion energy losses ( crsico et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "we have computed the values of @xmath19 for the modes with periods @xmath20 s , @xmath21 s and @xmath22 s ( @xmath23 ) of our asteroseismological model by adopting different axion emissions .",
    "as expected , the pulsation periods themselves do not vary appreciably , thus validating our asteroseismological model even with axion emission , but the rates of period change monotonically increase for increasing axion emission . in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] we display the theoretical value of @xmath19 corresponding to the period @xmath24  s. also shown is the most recent determination of the rate of period change for the period at @xmath25 of g117@xmath0b15a , according to kepler ( 2009 ) .",
    "note that , if we consider a standard deviation from the observational value , we conclude that the observations are compatible with an axion mass lower than @xmath26  mev .",
    "this value is about 5 times larger than that found by crsico et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , but in good agreement with the range of values obtained by bischoff - kim et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , which derived axion masses between 12 and 26.5  mev .",
    "on the basis of a new asteroseismological model for g117@xmath0b15a , the archetype of dav stars , and making use of the most recent determination of the rate of period change for the dominant mode of this star , we have derived a new upper limit of the mass of the ( up to now ) elusive particle called _",
    "we emphasize , however , that the derived upper limit for the axion mass ( @xmath26  mev ) is preliminary , since we have not quantified yet the uncertainties of white dwarf modeling ( core overshooting , rate of the reaction @xmath27c@xmath28o ) and the uncertainties related to the asteroseismological approach .",
    "the main conclusion of this preliminary study is that , if we assume that our asteroseismological model is a good representation of g117@xmath0b15a , in order to explain the high observed value of @xmath29 it is necessary to invoke some extra cooling mechanism , being the axion emission a very plausible one .",
