    "@xcite    the magnitude and the sign of the magnetic interactions in the two types of bonds are expected to be quite different .",
    "according to the so  called goodenough  kanamori  anderson ( gka ) rules , @xcite the _ leading _ isotropic superexchange of a 180@xmath1 bond between two magnetic ions with partially filled d shells is strongly antiferromagnetic , while the leading order of a 90@xmath1 superexchange is ferromagnetic , and much weaker . in the cu ",
    "o case , the reason for this is that for the corner  sharing geometry , the 2p@xmath15 orbital hybridizes with the two neighboring cu ions , yielding a significant contribution to the kinetic superexchange ( which is antiferromagnetic ) .",
    "in contrast , in the edge  sharing configuration the 2p@xmath15 orbital on the oxygen , which hybridizes with a 3d orbital on one copper , is almost orthogonal to that 3d orbital on the nearest ",

    "higher  order perturbation terms also determine the magnetic _ anisotropies _ , in both types of bonds .",
    "these anisotropies are responsible for various observable quantities , like the gaps in the spin wave spectrum , the spin orientations in space , etc , and hence are of much interest",

    "in particular , the role of the on  site coulomb exchange and the spin  orbit interaction in producing the various anisotropies was clarified in tetragonal and orthorhombic symmetries .    in the almost90@xmath1 bond ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) the leading order magnetic exchange is small .",

    "our calculation is based on the perturbation expansion of a hubbard model around the half - filled ground state , in which there is a single 3d hole on each copper ion , and the oxygen 2p states are completely full .",
    "since the spin of the cu hole is arbitrary , this ground state is 2@xmath17fold degenerate , where n is the number of copper ions .",
    "the superexchange magnetic hamiltonian is obtained as the effective interaction within this degenerate manifold .",
    "the microscopic hamiltonian we consider includes hopping between all orbitals on the copper d  states and on the oxygen p  states , and between the p states on neighboring oxygens .",
    "the hamiltonian also contains the spin  orbit interactions on the copper .",

    "the resulting explicit expressions for the magnetic couplings are very long , and we therefore skip them . instead , we have used the results above to produce the curves in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] , to obtain the magnetic couplings as function of the angular deviation @xmath16 .",
    "we have presented a detailed calculation of the magnetic interaction between nearest  neighbor and next  nearest  neighbor coppers in the edge  sharing geometry , and obtained numerical estimates for the various couplings as function of the angular deviation from 90@xmath1 .",
    "these numerical estimates are crucial for the analysis of the magnetic structures of many chain , ladder and lamellar cuprates .",
    "our calculation is based on a perturbation expansion of a general hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "it has been found before that for the magnetic _ anisotropies _ of the linear cu ",
    "o  cu bond , this expansion is quite reliable .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , it has been argued , ( again for the 180@xmath1bond ) , that perturbation theory fails to yield reasonable values for the leading magnetic _ isotropic intractions _",
    ", @xcite because the hopping matrix elements @xmath226 are not necessarily small compared with the on  site energies . however , the almost 90@xmath1 case discussed here is different , because of the appearance of the small coulomb matrix elements in the expansion .",
    "it therefore can be expected that the perturbation expansion for the present case yields reliable estimates .",
    "indeed , the comparison of our results for the nn isotropic energy with those obtained from exact diagonalization @xcite seem to support this conclusion .",
    "our results show that the out  of  plane anisotropy is negative , both for nn and for nnn coppers .",
    "this indicates an easy axis perpendicular to the cu  o plane , in agreement with ref . .",
    "we find that the pseudo ",
    "dipolar interaction between nearest ",
    "neighbors vanishes at strictly 90@xmath1 , and is minute for a small deviation away from it . as has been shown in ref .",
    ", this result is modified when one allows for a difference between the cu on  site energies @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "it seems that this should be the case in materials like sr@xmath9cu@xmath6o@xmath10cl@xmath9 , where some of the copper ions lose their local tetragonal symmetry : it has been found @xcite that experimental data on sr@xmath9cu@xmath6o@xmath10cl@xmath9 imply a finite value for this energy .",
    "this means that the interpretation of the data necessitates the inclusion of such effects , or of dipolar interactions . in the same manner",
