    "following the commissioning of scuba on jcmt(holland et al . 1999 ) , sub - mm surveys of distant universe have rapidly increased the number of sub - mm selected galaxies ( hughes et al .",

    "the advantages of selecting high - redshift objects based on a sub - mm wavelength are not only their negative _",
    "k_-correction up to @xmath9 ( blain et al .",
    "2002 ) but also their high sensitivity to very dusty objects , which are believed to be undergoing vigorous star formation at high redshift [ their median redshift is revealed to be @xmath52.4(smail et al . 2002a",
    "; chapman et al . 2003 ) ] .",
    "they are one of the candidates of forming giant elliptical galaxies based on the current observational and theoretical predictions ( lilly et al .",
    "although a very limited number of optical counterparts have been identified spectroscopically , they show notable diversity in their morphology ( extended and/or merging ) , agn possessions , dust temperatures , and so on ( smail et al .",
    "to study the mechanisms of galaxy formations , such as merging and/or gravitational collapses , we need to clarify the nature and the environments of these faint sub - mm sources . clearly , we need a much larger sample of faint sub - mm sources than we currently have",
    ". it also helps for comparing their features with nearby analogous objects , such as ultra - luminous iras galaxies and/or some other dusty populations detected by iso , mambo , etc .",
    "these populations might be missed by the popular ",
    "lyman break galaxy surveys \" [ there are only few cases of lyman break galaxies with sub - mm detection ( e.g. chapman et al .",
    "2002c ) ] .",
    "on the other hand , as firstly reported by cimatti et al.(1998 ) , there is some evidence that many of the sub - mm sources are associated with eros(extremely red objects)(cimatti et al .",

    "2002a ; ivison et al .",
    "2002 ; wehner et al . 2002 ; frayer et al .",
    "eros have red colors , which is consistent with elliptical galaxies at high redshift , and they are separated into two categories of dusty starburst population and passively evolved stellar systems .",
    "the former are believed to be young high - redshift objects with a large star - formation rate , and their features are consistent with forming elliptical galaxies based on theoretical predictions .",
    "therefore , searching for eros associated with faint scuba sources is one of the most effective methods for detecting obscured ( dusty ) star - forming galaxy at high redshift , though it may be limited only for z@xmath103 , because of large extinction of their optical(rest uv ) light by their internal dust .",
    "there have been several studies ( smail et al .",

    "2001 ; frayer et al .",
    "2003 ) which identified the ero counterparts of the sub - mm sources .",
    "furthermore , ivison et al.(2000 ) succeeded to obtain the redshifts of scuba sources at @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the a 1835 region , and there are some lower redshift samples with spectroscopically determined redshifts(e.g .",
    "smith et al .",
    "the lack of a suitable sample is partly because of their optical faintness .",
    "thus , it is needed to search for ero counterparts to those sub - mm sources that are optically bright enough for detailed spectroscopic studies .    using the gravitational lensing effect as a natural telescope , which amplifies",
    "the brightness of distant objects behind the lens , is one of the most powerful methods for obtaining detailed information on intrinsically faint objects .",
    "there have been many successful results in observing various types of high redshift galaxies using this effect , such as lyman break galaxies(pettini et al .",
    "2000 ; franx et al .",
    "1997 ) , faint scuba sources(ivison et al .",
    "2000 ; ivison et al . 2001 ; ledlow et al . 2002 ) and eros(g.p .",
    "smith et al .",
    "the advantages of using the lensing effect is not only its photometric , but also spatial magnification , which will provide enlarged images of smaller distant objects , corresponding to a very high effective spatial resolution , which could not be achieved by the usual ground based observations . by using these effects",
    ", we could investigate the detailed structures and also the environmental status of distant objects .    in order to search for bright counterparts of scuba sources and to investigate their surrounding environments in detail",

    "( 1994 ) and schneider et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , allowing calculations of the lensing amplification and distortion as a function of the position in the image plane . the essential parameters of the model are the redshift and the line - of - sight velocity dispersion of the cluster . the cluster ellipticity ( @xmath71 in table 2 . )",
    "is chosen based on a measurement of each bcg ( brightest cluster galaxy ) contour on the @xmath0-band images .",
    "the amplification imposed on each background galaxy depends on its redshift(z@xmath72 ) , and the redshift of the intervening lens ( z@xmath73 ) .",
    "we found that cumulative source counts depends weakly on the actual source redshift by investigating for the case of @xmath741.2 , 1.5 , 2.0 , 2.5 , and 3.0 , at which most of all eros are expected to lie . adopting a single value of @xmath75 introduced an uncertainty of at most less than 40% into the final surface density values for the whole field of view in ms @xmath1 , while it was less than 20% for ms @xmath3 . for overcoming these uncertainties , we adopted two single source planes of @xmath76 1.5 and 3.0 , and used in each cluster model to compute a map of the lens amplification as a function of the image plane position for each value of @xmath75 in each cluster field .",
    "we first used the amplification maps to de - amplify the image plane flux of each eros in our sample , and hence obtain their source plane @xmath0-band magnitudes . because gravitational lensing is achromatic",
    ", there is no need to correct the @xmath48 colors .",
    "the number of eros that are brighter than a source plane limiting magnitude can then be found by simply counting the number of sources brighter than the limiting magnitude in the source plane after correcting for lensing .",
    "a simple poisson uncertainty is attached to this value .",
    "we then calculated the area of the background sky within which eros were detectable in the relevant cluster field in the following manner .",
    "an ero with a source plane magnitude of @xmath77 will appear in the image plane of the relevant cluster with a magnitude brighter than an image plane detection limit of @xmath78 , if it is magnified by a factor greater than @xmath79 .",
    "the area in the source plane within which such a galaxy would be detected in that cluster is thus @xmath80(@xmath81 ) , where @xmath80(@xmath81 ) is the area of the @xmath82 source plane behind each cluster that lies within the cisco field of view , and is magnified by a factor greater than @xmath81(figure 8) .",
    "therefore , we can derive the surface number density from the dividing number of galaxies by @xmath80(@xmath83 ) .",
    "the derived surface densities for each cluster field are 2.43 arcmin@xmath36 for @xmath41 5.3 in ms @xmath1 , and 2.29 arcmin@xmath36 for @xmath35 5.3 in ms @xmath3 at @xmath84 for the source plane at @xmath82 .",
    "the cumulative surface densities as a function of the @xmath77 magnitude for a sample with @xmath85 are shown in figure 9 .",
    "we also plotted the result for the 0.6 arcmin@xmath86 area in ms @xmath1 ( rectangle surrounded by dotted lines in figure 3 ) , in which 7 eros were detected . about 20 and 10% of the whole survey areas",

    "because of the limit by the depth of the @xmath88-band magnitudes , the depth of our `` ero samples '' are decreased to @xmath89 .",
    "our sample thus provides one of the deepest ero sample ever reported .",

    "( 2002 ) surveyed lensed eros behind 10 massive clusters of galaxies around @xmath900.2 to a depth of @xmath70 @xmath5 20.6 , and measured the surface density of 1.2 arcmin@xmath36 for @xmath91 5.3 .",
    "they corrected the amplification effect from gravitational lensing using their own lens model , and estimated the corrected surface densities at @xmath70 @xmath10 21.6 as 2.5 arcmin@xmath36 .",

    "those are also consistent with the results by other wide field ero surveys , which suggest the clustering properties of eros ( daddi et al .",
    "2001 ; thompson et al .",
    "1999 ) . the most different property of our sample from g.p .",
    "smith et al.(2002 ) s is that most eros identified in ms @xmath1 show the colors which are common in dusty star - forming galaxies at high redshift(figure 7 ) , which indicate their strong star - formation activities , while most eros are passively evolved objects in smith et al.s .",
    "daddi et al.(2002 ) suggested that the strength of clustering is stronger in the old ero population than that of dusty starburst eros , and our results on the ms @xmath1 may be a very rare case .",
    "it may indicate that the deeper is the depth of observation , for example down to @xmath94 , the more will the ratio of dusty starbursts in ero population increase .",
    "this is suggested by smail et al .",
    "( 2002b ) with a radio - selected ero sample , and the ratio of the dusty population to the passive one is comparable at brighter magnitudes ( cimatti et al .",
    ". however , we also have to pay attention to the effect of the selection bias in our sample , which is made by targeting to lensed scuba sources , because it may increase the possibility of detecting dusty eros .    in the deepest magnitude ranges of our sample , there are deficiencies of eros compared to wehner et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , while the uncertainties of ours and of their results are very large .",
    "this is because both surveys have a very limited region coverages and also suffer from field variances of ero numbers .        as mentioned in the previous section ,",
    "7 eros are concentrated within a 0.6 arcmin@xmath86 sky area , and its corrected surface density is more than 7-times the average value ( figure 9 ) . for confirming the over density , however we have to take care of the fact that there are eros which are possible to be gravitationally lensed and separated ( splitted ) into several images ( e.g. `` a1 '' to `` a4 '' in figure 4 ) .",
    "these sources are well aligned in parallel to the `` blue arc '' , which is believed to be gravitationally elongated and split .",
    "if they are constructing an extremely red arc , the surface density will be decreased to 7.7 arcmin@xmath36 for @xmath95 or 23.1 arcmin@xmath36 for @xmath96 at @xmath97 ; however it is still a density enhancement .    for discussing the possibility of this lensing effect",
    ", we used the elliptical lens model , which was applied to a surface number count .",
    "the lens model also gives us a possibility to estimate the redshifts of lensed objects without any spectroscopic data , and may be able to set constraints on the spatial distribution of some eros .",
    "we compared the critical curves on the image plane for different source plane redshifts , as shown in figure 10 .",
    "we also overplotted the contour map of soft x - ray(0.21.5 kev ) image of chandra observation with 15000 s exposure to show the adequacy of our lensing model for approximating the cluster mass distribution .",
    "the images were retrieved from the chandra archive , and we used ciao software for extracting the soft band photon , combining each exposure and smoothing the resultant image .",
    "we applied 5-pixel gaussian adaptive smoothing for the image using the csmooth task .",
    "the shapes of the inner x - ray contours and the used mass distribution are in good agreement for a first - order approximation of the mass distribution .",
    "the sources `` a1 '' to `` a4 '' are very near to the critical curve , especially for @xmath98 in figure 10 .",
    "therefore , it is possible that they are forming a large extremely red arc , and are split images of an object at @xmath99",
    ". if they are , their colors must be very similar to each other , assuming no extinction differences along each light path .",
    "the colors of `` a1 '' and `` a4 '' are different , although the optical band magnitudes may be contaminated by other sources which are near to these objects .",
    "there remains a possibility that the colors of `` a2 '' and/or `` a3 '' will coincide with those of `` a1 '' and/or `` a4 '' because `` a2 '' and `` a3 '' are detected only in the @xmath0 band , and a color comparison was unavailable .",
    "although the estimated redshifts is @xmath100 by our lensing model , this is inconsistent with a photometric redshift of @xmath101 derived from the radio vs sub - mm index if they are counterparts of the sub - mm source .",
    "however it is possible that the photometric redshift estimate is not appropriate if the assumed dust temperature for the sed model is not correct ( blain et al .",
    "in fact , it is suggested that there is a diversity of the dust temperature of sub - mm sources based on a sample of sub - mm sources with redshifts ( chapman et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "it should also be noted that x - ray emission can not be completely fitted by a simple elliptical mass distribution . it is elongated to north - west direction , which has already been suggested by donahue et al .",
    "( 1995 ) using the rosat image , and the x - ray contours are uneven(figure 10 ) . for a more detailed discussion concerning the reality of a giant extremely red arc , it is necessary to use a lens model which is more sensitive to the local mass distribution , like that by kneib et al.(1996 ) .",
    "it will be considered in a future coming paper with some redshifts of bright objects and blue arcs .      for investigating the spatial clustering properties of these eros and red galaxies near smm j @xmath42 , we used a sed fitting for deriving the photometric redshifts for 6 objects among those ( extremely ) red objects ( `` a4 '' , `` b '' , `` c '' , `` d '' , `` e '' , and `` f '' ) , which had confirmed magnitudes in several bands . because the optical bands lights of `` a1 '' may be coming from a physically different source ( optical centroids are more than 1apart from @xmath0 image s centroid ) , we eliminated `` a1 '' from a list of our sed fitting . to avoid the effect of contamination from other surrounding sources , we used 1diameter magnitudes for sources `` a4 '' , `` b '' , and `` c '' , while they were 2for others .",
    "we used hyperz for the calculation , by stepping the extinction from @xmath102 0.0 to 5.0 using the extinction formula by calzetti et al.(2000 ) , and seeked the best solution in the range of @xmath103 .",
    "as shown in figure 11 , many objects , except for `` d '' and `` f '' , were fitted by seds of galaxies at high redshift(@xmath104 ) , which are consistent with the photometric redshift from sub - mm to radio index(@xmath105 ) , although with relatively small extinction[@xmath106 .",
    "these extinction values are equal to , or slightly higher than , the median of those of lyman break galaxies at @xmath107 ( steidel et al .",
    "1999 ; shapley et al .",
    "their @xmath108 colors are more than 5.0 , and thus redder than the sub - mm source lyman break galaxy `` w - mmd11 ''",
    "( chapman et al .",
    "they also have red @xmath7 colors ( @xmath109 ) , and their properties are similar to those of a red massive galaxy population at high redshift(@xmath110 ) , revealed by the faint infrared extragalactic survey(fires ; franx et al .",
    "2003 ; van dokkum et al .",
    "this red color can only be explained by a composite of the stellar ages with @xmath111300 myr and a certain amount of obscuration by dust ( franx et al .",
    "the ages for our red sources best fitted by our analysis range from 0.5 to 1.2 gyr .",
    "daddi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) suggested that their strong clustering at @xmath110 and our result can show the property .",
    "the derived extinction for `` d '' is large ( 0.89 ) , and it is a plausible nearby candidate of a sub - mm source . since the magnitudes of `` a4 '' may be contaminated by neighboring foreground objects and/or contribution from diffuse emission by the cluster , the fluxes in the optical bands may be mainly coming from other sources .",
    "therefore , it can have redder colors than those listed in table 1 , and we could not eliminate the possibility of `` a4 '' as being a counterpart of a sub - mm source . if so , its redshift can be higher , and may be the same as those of `` b '' and `` c '' . if `` a1 '' to `` a4 '' are constructing an extremely red arc , it is another plausible candidate of a sub - mm source , and they may have a spatial concentration with `` b '' and `` c '' .    it is noted that the results of photometric redshifts using different extinction models , like fitzpatrick(1986 ) for large the magellanic cloud or prevot et al .",
    "( 1984 ) and bouchet et al .",
    "( 1985 ) for the small megellanic cloud , provided slightly higher redshifts .    by combining the result of our analysis",
    ", we can suggest one possibility that this extended sub - mm flux is coming from a high - redshift object , which must be lensed by a foreground cluster , and there may be a contribution from a lower redshifted ( @xmath112 ) dusty object , `` d '' . since there is some evidence that lyman break galaxies are not main contributor to the cosmic sub - mm background radiation ( adelberger , steidel 1999 ; webb et al .",
    "2002 ) , `` b '' , `` c '' , and `` e '' may be eliminated from the counterpart candidates ; however , they may be spatially clustering near to the sub - mm emission . for secure counterpart identification and confirming the speculation of their clustering properties , it is essential to perform a deep radio interferometric observation and spectroscopic follow - up observations in optical or near - infrared wavelength .",
    "using chandra hard ( 48kev ) x - ray images , which was produced from the same data as that for figure 10 , we checked the coincidences of x - ray detections around sub - mm sources in the ms @xmath1 region , although no counterparts were identified .",
    "this is consistent with the result of previous studies because about 50000-s exposure by chandra is not sufficient for detecting the x - ray flux from a large amount of sub - mm sources ( alexander et al .",
