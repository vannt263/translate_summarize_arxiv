    "the presence of cold dark matter ( cdm ) in our universe is now well established by a number of observational experiments , especially the very precise measurement of the cosmic microwave background radiation in the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) experiment @xcite .",
    "though the gravitational nature of the dark matter ( dm ) is established , we know almost nothing about the particle nature , except that it is , to a high extent , electrically neutral .    one of the most appealing and natural cdm particle candidates is the _ weakly interacting massive particle_@xcite . it is a coincidence that if the dark matter is produced thermally in the early universe , the required annihilation cross section times the velocity is about @xmath6 pb",
    "this is exactly the size of the cross sections that one expects from a weak interaction process and that would give a large to moderate production at the lhc . in general",
    ", the production of dark matter particles at the lhc gives rise to large missing energy .",
    "thus , the anticipated signature in the final state is high-@xmath7 jets or leptons plus large missing energy .",
    "the most studied dark matter candidate is the neutralino of the supersymmetric models with @xmath8 parity conservation@xcite . in this work ,",
    "we study a different scenario , the @xmath0 gauge - higgs unification model@xcite based on the randall - sundrum warped space@xcite .",
    "the dark matter is the higgs boson@xcite , which is a part of the fifth component of a gauge boson field in the model .",
    "in such a 5d model , the higgs boson is the fluctuation mode of the aharonov - bohm phase @xmath9 in the extra dimension@xcite .",
    "it was shown that at the value of @xmath10 the effective potential of the higgs boson is minimized .",
    "furthermore , the invariance of the effective interactions under @xmath11 prohibits triple vertices such as @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , which is true to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "thus , the higgs boson is stable and can be a dark matter candidate .    in this model , the interactions of the higgs boson with the @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and",
    "sm fermions are via 4-point vertices .",
    "the higgs boson can be thermally produced in the early universe via @xmath15 . like other dm candidates ,",
    "the drop of the annihilation rate below the universe expansion rate triggered the freeze - out of the higgs boson as cdm .",
    "it was shown in ref.@xcite that the higgs boson mass needs to be at 70 gev in order to satisfy the constraint from wmap .",
    "focused on 4-point vertices of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , we study the collider signatures of this dark matter model .",
    "our main process is the production of a pair of the higgs bosons associated with a @xmath4 or @xmath5 boson .",
    "the final state consists of charged leptons plus large missing energy .",
    "however , the detection of this signal is very challenging .",
    "the signal cross section is generically small due to the @xmath18 process with the weak coupling .",
    "in addition , only one single observable particle in the final state provides very limited kinematics , which could be used to reduce the sm background .",
    "as shown below , the signal at the lhc is too small to be useful . on the other hand , the international linear collider ( ilc ) with high beam polarization@xcite",
    "can substantially improve the sensitivity to the signal .",
    "we consider a @xmath0 gauge - higgs unification model in the 5d randall - sundrum warped space@xcite .",
    "the higgs boson is the fluctuation mode of the aharonov - bohm phase @xmath19 along the fifth dimension , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    "the effective interactions of the higgs boson are @xmath21 where these mass functions are @xmath22 and @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath24 is the weak gauge coupling and @xmath25 .",
    "the higgs effective potential @xmath26 is generated at one loop level .",
    "it is finite and cutoff independent as well as leading to finite higgs boson mass : the gauge hierachy problem does not arise .",
    "brief comments on the electroweak symmetry breaking are in order here .",
    "the electroweak symmetry is preserved at @xmath27 , as can be seen in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 boson masses in eq.([eq : mw : mz ] ) .",
    "hosotani _ et.al .",
    "_ showed that the contributions from the gauge bosons and their kk states do not change the position of the global minimum of @xmath28@xcite .",
    "however , the large but negative contribution from the 5d top quark field turns @xmath26 upside down , leading to its global minimum at @xmath10 . in this model ,",
    "the large yukawa coupling of the top quark triggers the electroweak symmetry breaking dynamically , and the @xmath4 and @xmath5 gauge bosons and the sm fermions acquire nonzero masses .    at low energy , this model has the sm particles plus one neutral higgs boson .",
    "since @xmath29 in eq.([eq : effective : v ] ) with @xmath30 is invariant under @xmath11 , a new @xmath1 parity emerges under which the higgs boson has odd parity while all the other sm particles have even parity .",
    "this @xmath1 parity protects the stability of the higgs boson , making it a cdm candidate , and prohibits triple vertices of the higgs boson with the sm particles .",
    "note that the @xmath1 parity is dynamically generated unlike the @xmath8 parity in supersymmetric models .",
    "the low energy behavior of the model depends on only two parameters , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "first , @xmath31 is determined by the observed @xmath33 and @xmath34 , i.e. , @xmath35 .",
    "second , the higgs boson mass is in principle determined by the matter content of the model .",
    "because of the high model dependence , the higgs mass has been treated as an unknown parameter .",
    "the observed relic density of cdm by wmap fixes the higgs boson mass about @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "such a low higgs boson mass does not contradict the lep bound of the higgs boson because of the absence of the @xmath13 coupling .",
    "if we further relax the relic density constraint as not overclosing the universe , the higgs boson mass can be heavier than @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "we do not consider the 4-point vertices @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the sm fermion .",
    "this vertex comes from the yukawa coupling , which is proportional to the fermion mass .",
    "although this gives rise to important implications on the direct detection rate , the interaction magnitudes involving @xmath37 are very small , except for the top quark .",
    "the process @xmath39 is also very challenging to observe due to the smaller cross section of the @xmath40 process as well as more difficult identification of top quarks .",
    "therefore , we focus on the 4-point vertices of @xmath41 and @xmath17 : @xmath42",
    "feynman diagram for the production of a pair of missing higgs boson associated with a sm gauge boson @xmath43 . ]",
    "as suggested in ref.@xcite , the collider signature of the higgs dm involves their pair production .",
    "sole pair production via processes such as @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 leaves only missing energy in the final state , which has nothing to be triggered on .",
    "we need at least one visible particle to probe the missing transverse energy .",
    "we consider the following production of a pair of higgs bosons associated with a sm gauge boson @xmath47 at the lhc and ilc : @xmath48 .",
    "this process is basically through the feynman diagram in fig.[fig : feyn ] .",

    "the differential cross section is @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the 3-body phase space factor and the symmetric factor @xmath57 is due to a pair of identical higgs bosons in the final state .",
    "we can consider both leptonic and hadronic decays of the @xmath5 boson .",
    "the signature in the final state is a reconstructed @xmath5 boson with a large missing transverse energy .",

    "the other reducible backgrounds include @xmath59jets with the jets lost in the beam pipe , @xmath60 production with the charged leptons or jets reconstructed at the @xmath5 mass while all other particles are undetected .",

    "on the other hand , we have shown that the whole situation substantially improves at the ilc with polarized beams .",
