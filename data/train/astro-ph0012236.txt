    "quasars have been used as efficient probes of high - redshift clustering because they are known to favour rich environments .",
    "quasars may also trace large - scale structures at early epochs ( @xmath6 ) in the form of large quasar groups ( lqgs ) , which have sizes comparable to the largest structures at the present epoch .",
    "several examples of lqgs are known ( e.g. webster 1982 ; crampton , cowley & hartwick 1989 ) , of which the largest is the clowes - campusano lqg of 18 quasars at @xmath0 , with a maximal extent of @xmath1 ( clowes & campusano 1991 ) , making it the largest known structure at high redshifts .",
    "it has been suggested that lqgs trace large - scale structures at early epochs , and there is increasing evidence that this is the case , with associated mgii absorbers , star - forming regions , and galaxy clustering all recently observed .",
    "however the relationship between the lqg quasars and mass ( galaxies ) appears to be rather complicated .",
    "gas associated with the clowes - campusano lqg has been detected by mgii absorption from observations of background quasars , with a @xmath7 overdensity at @xmath8 ( 11 observed , 4 expected ) .",
    "optical and narrow - band ( oii ) imaging of quasars from the @xmath9 crampton et al .",
    "lqg find excesses of blue and emission - line galaxies around 10 of the 11 quasars , indicating that the quasars are located within regions of enhanced star - formation ( hutchings , crampton & johnson 1995 ) .",
    "however , to determine whether lqgs trace large - scale structure require observations that can identify associated clustering of quiescent galaxies , not just star - forming regions , as these are likely to be short - lived and do not necessarily imply significant associated masses .",
    "the quiescent galaxies which are the easiest to detect , and which are the best indicators of galaxy clustering , are the massive ellipticals which dominate cluster cores .",
    "these have been observed at low redshifts to form a homogeneous population , forming very tight colour - magnitude relations known as _ red sequences _ indicative of old stellar populations ( 1213 gyr ) .",
    "this red sequence has been followed in the optical for clusters out to @xmath10 and is consistent with the passive evolution of galaxies that formed in a monolithic collapse at @xmath11 . at @xmath12",
    "these galaxies should be characterised by extremely - red optical - nir colours ( @xmath13 ) as their strong 4000@xmath14 break is redshifted into the @xmath15 band .",
    "several @xmath16 clusters have been found through the combination of ultra - deep optical and deep near - infrared imaging of targetted fields around high - redshift agn ( dickinson 1995 ; tanaka et al .",
    "2000 ) and regions of extended x - ray emission ( stanford et al . 1997 ; rosati et al .",
    "1999 ) , with red sequences observed at @xmath17 as predicted by the monolithic collapse model .",
    "to examine the galaxy environment of quasars in the clowes - campusano lqg , we have conducted an ultra - deep optical ( to @xmath18 ) study of a @xmath19 field containing 3 quasars from this lqg , using the btc camera on the 4-m blanco telescope at ctio .",
    "we have also obtained @xmath20 imaging of subfields around 2 of the lqg quasars , and have examined the galaxy environments of the quasars by searching for galaxies with the extremely - red optical - nir colours ( @xmath21 ) of passively - evolving galaxies at the quasar redshift .",
    "the first quasar environment we have studied in detail is that of the radio - quiet lqg quasar 104420.8 + 055739 at z=1.226 for which we obtained ukirt imaging of a @xmath22 field centred on the quasar , reaching @xmath23 .",
    "we find a 3.5@xmath24 excess of @xmath25 galaxies in this field , with 79 observed against 41 expected .",
    "this excess is due entirely to a factor @xmath2611 overdensity of @xmath4 galaxies , that must have @xmath27 to explain their colour .",
    "half of the @xmath4 galaxies make up the clear red sequences in the colour - magnitude plots of figure 1 at @xmath28 , comparable to red sequences observed in other @xmath16 clusters ( dickinson 1995 ; rosati et al . 1999 ) .",
    "this indicates a population of 1518 passively - evolving massive ellipticals at the quasar redshift , and is clear evidence of a moderately rich cluster associated with the quasar .",
    "the remainder of the @xmath4 galaxies , mostly with @xmath29 , have much bluer optical colours than the red sequence galaxies with @xmath30 .",
    "these do not appear to fit any of the standard bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) gissel96 evolutionary models which assume : either a single burst of star - formation followed by passive evolution ; or an exponentially - decaying star - formation rate .",
    "such galaxies appear rare in field regions ( @xmath31 ) , but have been observed both in other @xmath16 clusters ( tanaka et al .",
    "2000 ) and at fainter magnitudes with @xmath32 ( moustakas et al . 1997 ) , and have been described as ` red outliers ' .",
    "given their relative rarity in field regions , we assume that they are associated with the cluster , and that they have some recent star - formation that causes the blue optical colour , and that their extremely - red @xmath33 colour is produced by a combination of dust and dominant old stellar populations .",
    "having found associated clustering for the z=1.226 lqg quasar , we consider the spatial distribution of the galaxies ( figure 2 ) to examine the quasar s location in relation to the clustering .",
    "the red sequence galaxies ( shown as solid symbols ) do not appear concentrated towards the quasar .",
    "instead they appear concentrated in two compact groups , one towards the top - centre of the image ( including the four brightest members labelled g14 ) and the other in the bottom - right corner .",
    "this suggests that the galaxy excesses and red sequences could be due to two clusters at similar redshifts .",
    "there are three galaxies ( labelled c1c3 ) within 5 arcsec of the quasar .",
    "c3 is one of the red sequence galaxies , whilst c1 and c2 , both just 3 arcsec from the quasar , are compact and somewhat fainter and bluer .",
    "compact companions are found for a significant fraction of quasars , and it has been suggested that these are the remnants of the galaxy merging event which triggered the quasar . certainly , if c1 and c2 are associated with the quasar , they have undergone a recent episode of star - formation , presumably caused by the merger process .    to compare this quasar field with the results of hutchings et al .",
    "we have also examined the distribution of blue ( @xmath34 ) galaxies ( shown as star symbols ) .",
    "we find a concentration of blue galaxies within 30 arcsec of the quasar , which appears to be extended towards the north - east , forming a ` band ' that bisects the two groups of red sequence galaxies .",
    "this band presumably corresponds to a region of enhanced star - formation , similar to those observed by hutchings et al . around several @xmath9 lqg quasars .",
    "we propose that this band of star - formation , and possibly the quasar itself , have been triggered by the merging of the two groups of red sequence galaxies , as the galaxies interact with the colliding icms .",
    "cluster merging events have been observed at low redshifts to be capable of inducing starbursts simultaneously in galaxies across cluster length - scales ( e.g. caldwell et al .",
    "such events are predicted to be relatively common at high redshifts in hierarchical clustering models , and many of the high redshift clusters found to date show signs of merging .",
    "to examine the galaxy environments of all four @xmath0 quasars in the btc field , and to search for any large - scale structure associated with the lqg , we have selected _ red _ galaxies with the same optical colours and magnitudes as the red sequence galaxies ( @xmath36 ) found around the z=1.226 quasar .",
    "the selection criteria should pick out @xmath37 passively - evolving galaxies , and so peaks in their density distribution ( as estimated using the adaptive kernel method ) should mark out @xmath37 clusters .",
    "this can be considered a crude example of the red sequence cluster finding method successfully used by gladders & yee ( 2000 ) .",
    "density maps of @xmath38 ( @xmath39 at @xmath0 ) fields around each of the four @xmath0 quasars are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the density map of the z=1.226 lqg quasar field indicates that the clusters formed by the two groups of red sequence galaxies extend significantly beyond the @xmath20 image , the south - eastern group extending 3 arcmin to the north and east .",
    "a statistical analysis of the two groups reject the null hypothesis that the galaxy distribution is taken from a single elliptical gaussian probability density function at the 2% level , i.e. the substructure is real .",
    "there are two further compact groups to the south of the quasar , and the structure as a whole is suggestive of being a cluster in the early stages of formation though the progressive coalescence of subclusters .",
    "the most significant cluster of red galaxies across the entire btc field is located 3 arcmin to the south - west of the z=1.306 lqg quasar ( figure 3b ) , and so @xmath20 imaging was obtained to determine whether this was associated with the quasar .",
    "however photometric redshift estimates based on the galaxies @xmath40 colours indicate that the cluster lies at @xmath10 , and not at the quasar redshift , the quasar itself appearing to reside in a poor environment .",
    "the cluster may not be associated with the lqg , but still appears interesting .",
    "it is dominated by a very compact core containing a dozen galaxies whose colours are consistent with being passively - evolving galaxies at @xmath10 but whose morphologies appear unusually compact , as well a comparable number of faint blue galaxies indicating that there is significant star - formation occurring in the cluster .",
    "the third lqg quasar also appears to reside in a poor environment , with no sign of clustering of optically - red galaxies nearby .",
    "a background quasar at z=1.426 however is located on the edge of a cluster of red galaxies , with a second cluster 3 arcmin to the north , suggesting that this quasar is associated with a rich environment .",
    "the four quasars are located in a variety of environments , but those with associated clustering are found on the cluster _ peripheries _ rather than in the cluster cores .",
    "this is in agreement with observations of 7 radio - loud quasars at @xmath41 ( sanchz & gonzlez - serrano 1999 ) , and with the framework of quasar activity being triggered by the infall of gas onto a seed black hole .",
    "firstly , galaxies in the centres of clusters have previously lost most or all of their gas , and secondly , the encounter velocities of galaxies in the cluster cores are too high for mergers to efficiently trigger nuclear activity .",
    "the finding of associated clustering of passively - evolving galaxies for some of the lqg quasars supports the theory that lqgs trace large - scale structure at high - redshifts , although the relationship between quasars and mass / galaxies appears complex .",
