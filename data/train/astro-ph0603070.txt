    "the subclass of broad absorption line quasars ( balqsos ) is thought to account for between 10% and 30% of quasars .",
    "the exact fraction of balqsos is nontrivial to determine because of differential selection effects between balqso and non - balqsos .",

    "broad absorption troughs are caused by gas outflowing at high velocities from quasars .",

    "1999 ; schmidt & hines 1999 ; hall et  al .",
    "balqsos generally have uv to soft x - ray flux ratios 10 - 30 times smaller than unabsorbed quasars ( brandt , laor , & wills 2000 ) , though if balqsos are corrected for intrinsic absorption , their uv to soft x - ray flux ratio is typical of normal quasars ( gallagher et  al . 2002 ) .",
    "three sources of material can cause absorption in the spectrum of a quasar : ( 1 ) `` intrinsic , '' produced by processes related to the agn itself , ( 2 ) `` host , '' produced by material in the quasar s host galaxy unrelated to the agn , and ( 3 ) `` intervening , '' absorbing material along the line of sight but not physically related to the agn or host galaxy .",
    "broader and higher - velocity absorption troughs are more likely to be intrinsic , since only the agn can feasibly accelerate matter to the velocities and velocity widths observed in balqsos ( both often @xmath15 ) .",
    "balqsos are classified into three subcategories based upon the material producing the bal troughs .",
    "high - ionization balqsos ( hibals ) contain strong , broad absorption troughs shortward of high - ionization emission lines and are typically identified through the presence of @xmath1 absorption troughs .",
    "low - ionization balqsos ( lobals ) contain hibal features but also have absorption from low - ionization lines such as @xmath2 .",

    "we account for differing luminosities , line widths ( and thus indirectly any mean blueshift of @xmath1 with respect to @xmath2 ) and possible redshift trends by finding the best - fit template for each quasar from a set of templates binned in line width , luminosity , and redshift .",
    "quasars for the set of template spectra were selected from the specphotoall table of the public dr3 catalog archive server ( stoughton et  al .",

    "is evaluated over a wide grid of @xmath89 to find the minimizing values .",
    "this occurred for only 4 @xmath1 and 49 @xmath2 objects .",

    "the template emission line profile is scaled to match the peak flux in the 5-pixel - smoothed sample emission region and the continuum is then re - added to the scaled emission line profile .    despite our best efforts at automating our template - fitting methods , some objects are poorly fit by all of the templates",
    ". a bad template fit often results in a falsely identified or missed balqso .",

    "this ideal definition of broad intrinsic absorption requires perfect knowledge of the systematic velocity , the continuum , and which troughs are truly intrinsic and which arise from host or intervening systems",
    ". the automated sdss redshift determination scheme should produce consistent systemic velocities , and our system of continuum fitting with multiple templates is designed to address the problem of accurately estimating the continuum .",

    "both the @xmath1 doublet ( separation @xmath100 ) and the @xmath2 doublet ( separation @xmath101 ) almost always appear as a single broad emission line in quasar spectra .",
    "a minimum trough width of @xmath102 would ideally exclude all @xmath1 features wherein the doublet was still distinct .",
