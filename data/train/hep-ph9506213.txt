    "there are several reasons why semileptonic @xmath0 decays are of interest . for one thing , the are a small variety of decay products , namely those which contain charm quarks ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , etc . ) and those which do not ( @xmath4 s etc . ) .",
    "@xmath5 can be determined from the relative number of these decays .",
    "in addition , the heavy masses of the b and c quarks suggest that one might be able to apply perturbative qcd to calculate the strong corrections to these processes .",
    "this hope has been recently formalised in heavy quark effective theory@xcite .",
    "finally , there s the fact that theoretical uncertainties are much smaller than in non - leptonic decays which contain a wider variety of hadronic decay products .",
    "if we write out a parameterisation for the ckm matrix , we see that it depends on a complex phase which is resposible for cp violation in the standard model .",
    "the magnitudes of the values for the ckm matrix elements place limits on the size of this phase and , thus , on the amount of cp violation in the standard model . according to the particle data group , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "recent values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the literature fall in this range [ 3 - 8 ] .    in studying semi - leptonic decays ,",
    "the first approximation is to neglect qcd and use a spectator model in which the up quark of the @xmath0 meson is not involved in the decay except to recombine with the charm quark . in such a model",
    ", the decay of the @xmath0 meson into a @xmath1 meson reduces to that of the decay of a bottom quark into a charm quark .",
    "quantities that can be determined directly from experimental data include the square of the momentum transfer , @xmath10 and the lepton energy , @xmath11 .",
    "now that we have a process involving quanties that can be determined from experiment , we would want to come up with a theory that relates these quanties .",
    "one such model was the one devised by altarelli , cabbibo , corbo , maiani and martinelli in 1982@xcite . in this model ,",
    "the bottom quark was assumed to be on shell and , thus , given by @xmath12 in the @xmath0 rest frame .",
    "this assumption has the advantage that it avoids having the decay rate depend on an arbitrary overall @xmath13 that appears in a purely partonic treatment of these decays@xcite the up quark momentum was then assumed to obey a gaussian distribution , @xmath14 which is normalised according to @xmath15 and is thus fixed up to an adjustable parameter , @xmath16 , known as the fermi momentum .    in our case , we want to consider the up quark as being more than a mere spectator : instead we write the effective @xmath17 vertex as @xmath18 .",
    "the decay rate in this model is @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21.\\ ] ]    it turns out this this integral is difficult to evaluate , the problem being that the up and charm quarks are not being assumed to combine into a specific meson . instead , the quarks are combining to form a cluster @xmath22 with four momentum @xmath23 and mass @xmath24 .",
    "this @xmath25 is arbitrary save for the fact that , experimentally , @xmath26 gev while energy conservation requires that @xmath27 . as a result",
    ", we will want to rewrite the hadronic phase space so that @xmath25 is integrated over this range . using standard cluster decomposition techniques ,",
    "the decay rate becomes : @xmath28    using@xcite @xmath29 we get @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "the remaining delta functions are @xmath32 and @xmath33 these cancel with the cosine integrations in @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the final expression for the decay rate is , thus , @xmath36    if we now compare this formula with data from argus@xcite@xcite and cleo@xcite then we find , after minimising with respect to the parameters @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath16 and @xmath40 , that we get a good fit for parameters in the ranges @xmath41    note that the argus and cleo data include contributions from @xmath42 and @xmath43 decays . in each case , the measured electrons were separated into different categories including electrons from non-@xmath44 events , @xmath45 or @xmath46 decay , @xmath47 decay or semileptonic @xmath48 decay , semileptonic @xmath1 decay , @xmath49 decay and semileptonic @xmath0 decay , the latter being the ones that are used to make these plots .",
    "additional background comes from having hadrons misidentified as electrons .",
    "note that for @xmath50 gev , electrons from @xmath0 decay can only come from charmless semi - leptonic decays .",
    "using these parameters and taking the areas under the curves gives us the branching ratio @xmath51=10.09% and @xmath52 = .16% .",
    "using @xmath53 and knowing@xcite that @xmath54 gev , @xmath55 can be calculated to be @xmath56 .",
    "in the spectator model , one can differentiate between @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons according to whether the daughter meson has spin 0 or 1 .",
    "that one can do this was overlooked in a recent paper by v. barger _ et al _ that attempted to differentiate between different decay products in the differential @xmath25 distribution@xcite .",
    "mahiko suzuki@xcite used this observation to calculate exclusive rates at zero fermi momentum . in this frame",
    ", @xmath57 where @xmath58 /[4m\\{2m(e_c+m)\\}^{1\\over2}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath59/[4m\\{2m(e_c+m)\\}^{1\\over2}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath60 represents the three polarisations satisfying @xmath61 . in the rest frame of @xmath62",
    ", @xmath60 is , therefore , given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 signify transverse and longitudinal polarisations , repectively .",
    "in the case where the @xmath66 is not at rest in the @xmath0 rest frame @xmath67 is defined specifically in the @xmath0 rest frame .",
    "now , if instead of considering the light quark as a spectator , we treat it as an intermediate decay product in an effective theory involving a @xmath68 loop , then the relevant traces are @xmath69 & \\\\ & m_1^\\lambda\\propto tr\\left[(c\\kern-4.5 pt / + m_c)\\gamma^\\lambda ( 1-\\gamma_5)(b\\kern-5 .",

    "the wavefunctions @xmath78 and @xmath79 are @xmath80 where @xmath16 and @xmath81 are independent adjustable parameters .",
    "@xmath82 is given by @xmath83 ^ 2-m_u^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 is the energy of the up quark in the @xmath1 rest frame .",
    "the phase space simplifies as follows : @xmath85 @xmath86 and @xmath87 implies @xmath88 so the phase space becomes @xmath89    if we now insert into this model the parameters given in the previous section we run into problems : it turns out that we only get agreement with argus @xcite data for low values of @xmath90 .",
    "this is presumably due to final - state interactions , which in a perturbative qcd framework are expected to grow as one approaches the end - point of the @xmath90 distribution . in the exclusive case , qcd corrections",
    "are restricted to those which do not create additional hadrons , that is quark propagator self - corrections and vertex corrections .",
    "corrections to the @xmath91 vertex are of particular interest because they provide a phenomenological explanation for the discrepancy : the exchange of a gluon between the up and charm quark can reduce their relative momentum , allowing them to combine to form a @xmath1 or @xmath2 meson .",
    "this model effectively describes the dependence of both inclusive and exclusive semileptonic @xmath0 decays on the fermi momentum of the constituent quarks .",
    "the parameters that arise naturally in this model agree with those used in other models .    given that this model describes both inclusive and exclusive decays , we can estimate the rate of semileptonic @xmath0 decays into @xmath3 mesons or clusters consisting of @xmath1 s or @xmath92 and @xmath4 s by subtracting the exclusive rates into @xmath1 and @xmath92 from the inclusive semileptonic @xmath0 decays into charmed mesons .",
    "experimentally , this rate is found to be between 33% and 41% of the total semileptonic rate@xcite@xcite .",
    "this model would appear to have the best chance of accounting for all possible semileptonic decay products of @xmath0 mesons .",
