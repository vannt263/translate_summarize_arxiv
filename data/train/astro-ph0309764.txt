    "x - ray flux fluctuations observed in type i x - ray bursts in lmxb s ( see , e.g. , strohmayer et al 1996 , 1997 for so called burst oscillations ) are quasi - periodic oscillations whose frequencies are found in a frequency range around @xmath12300hz or around @xmath12600hz . during a burst , from the onset to the tail , the oscillation frequency in a given source usually increases with time by a small amount and gets saturated to an asymptotic frequency in the tail .",
    "the observed frequency drifts are generally less than @xmath121% of the mean frequency ( e.g. , cumming & bildsten 2000 )",
    ". however , the time evolution of burst oscillations are not always that simple .",
    "in fact , some x - ray burst sources have been reported to show a temporal decrease of the oscillation frequency in the tail of bursts ( e.g. , strohmayer 1999 , miller 2000 , muno et al .",
    "2000 ) , or to show simultaneously two oscillation frequencies separated by a few hz in a burst ( miller 2000 , galloway et al 2001 , muno et al 2002 ) .",
    "burst oscillations could be very important for neutron star physics . on the assumption that the oscillation frequencies are directly tied to the spin frequency of the star",
    ", the stability of the asymptotic frequency found in the tail of bursts separated by a few years has been used to determine some of the physical parameters of binary systems ( e.g. , strohmayer et al 1998 , gilles et al 2002 ) . for recent observational and theoretical developements concerning burst oscillations as well as thermonuclear bursts on neutron stars ,",
    "see a review paper by strohmayer & bildsten ( 2003 ) .    as a model for burst oscillations ,",
    "strohmayer et al ( 1997 ) proposed that the oscillations are produced by inhomogeneous hot burning spots , the burning fronts of which are expanding laterally on the surface of a rotating neutron star , and that the frequency drifts are associated with the vertical expansion and contraction of the burning spots conserving angular momentum .",
    "the model was later refined by cumming & bildsten ( 2000 ) , and cumming et al ( 2001 ) concluded that the possible amount of relative frequency changes expected in the model was by a factor of 2 to 3 smaller than the largest observed values ( see also muno , zel , & chakrabarty 2002 ) .",
    "this model also has a difficulty in explaining the persistence of the oscillations to the tail of a burst , in which no inhomogeneity to produce the oscillations will remain because all the surface area has been reached by the burning fronts .",
    "spitkovsky , levin , & ushomirsky ( 2002 ) , on the other hand , discussed the global hydrodynamical flow in the ocean of an accreting neutron star , by taking into account the rapid rotation and the lift - up of the burning ocean , and conjectured that jupiter - type vortices created in strong zonal fluid currents driven in a nuclear burst are responsible for burst oscillations in the tail .",
    "it was heyl ( 2001 ) who suggested that the burst oscillations could be produced by the @xmath0-modes of low azimuthal wavenumber @xmath15 or @xmath16 traveling in the surface ocean of the neutron star .",
    "the @xmath0-modes are retrograde toroidal modes and are called rossby waves in geophysical context ( see , e.g. , greenspan 1968 , pedlosky 1987 ) .",
    "the @xmath0-modes in mass - accreting envelopes on the surface of a @xmath21 rotating neuton star have been discussed by strohmayer & lee ( 1996 ) , who found that the fundamental @xmath0-modes with no radial nodes of the eigenfunctions are all pulsationally stable except for the cases of mass - acceretion rates @xmath22 as low as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 denotes the eddington rate . in this paper , we extend the previous analysis to the cases of rapidly rotating neutron stars , considering that the spin frequencies @xmath1 of many neutron stars in lmxb s are now believed to be in a rather narrow range around @xmath25hz .",
    "the main points behind the @xmath0-mode model for burst oscillations may be described as follows .",
    "let us assume that strong nuclear burning in the convective phase of a nuclear burst excites surface @xmath0-modes whose time and azimuthal dependence is given by @xmath26)$ ] , where @xmath2 denotes the oscillation frequency in the corotating frame and the integer @xmath5 is the azimuthal wave number . for the @xmath0-modes , @xmath2 is proportional to and is much smaller than the spin frequency @xmath1 of the star , and @xmath2 is positive for positive @xmath5 in the convention we use in this paper .",
    "observers measure the inertial frame frequency @xmath27 , the magnitude of which is @xmath28 . at the end of the burst ,",
    "the ocean cools and becomes radiative , and the rotating frame oscillation frequency decreases to @xmath29 and the magnitude of the inertial frame frequency increases to @xmath30 .",
    "this model then predicts a fractional increase in the measured inertial frame frequency from the start of the burst to the asymptotic end , which may be given by @xmath11 . to estimate possible magnitudes of the quantity @xmath18",
    ", we calculate in this paper the @xmath0-modes for radiative envelopes and convective envelopes , assuming that the envelopes are in steady state .",
    " 2 and 3 briefly describe method of calculation employed in this paper , and  4 is for numerical results , and  5 and 6 are for discussion and conclusion .",
    "method of calculation for steadily mass - accreting , nuclear - burning , thin surface envelopes is almost the same as that given in strohmayer & lee ( 1996 ) .",
    "no effects of general relativity are included in this paper .",
    "if we use the independent variable defined as @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the total mass of the star and the mass contained in the sphere of radius @xmath0 , the basic ordinary differential equations for mass - accreting and nuclear - burning thin envelopes in steady state are @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 and the energy transfer equation in convection zones is @xmath37 and that in radiative zones is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the mass density , @xmath40 is the pressure , @xmath41 is the temperature , @xmath42 is the internal energy per gram , @xmath43 is the opacity , @xmath44 is the nuclear energy generation rate per gram , @xmath45 is the neutrino energy loss rate per gram , @xmath46 is the luminosity at @xmath0 , @xmath47 is the mass accretion rate , and @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 are the gravitational constant , the radiation constant , and the velocity of light , respectively .",

    "we apply both weak and strong electron screening corrections to the nuclear energy generation rates following salpeter & van horn ( 1969 ) . for the energy loss rate due to neutrino",
    "emission we employ formulae given by beaudet , petrosian , & salpeter ( 1967 ) . for opacity , we use a subroutine written by paczyski ( 1970 ) who adopted cox & stewart ( 1970 ) radiative opacity and the conductive opacity by hubbard & lampe ( 1969 ) and canuto ( 1970 ) .    for given @xmath32 , @xmath75 , and @xmath22",

    "the envelope models calculated in this way are fully radiative with no convective regions , and are simply called radiative models in this paper .",
    "as discussed by hanawa & sugimoto ( 1982 ) , there developes a convective zone in the nuclear burning region of the surface envelope immediately after the onset of a nuclear flash . to obtain a @xmath88 model in a nuclear flash",

    "we treat the mass extent @xmath91 of the convection zone above the base as a parameter , where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the mass depths at the base and at the top of the convection zone , respectively .",
    "the temperature gradient in the convection zone is given by equation ( 5 ) , and the composition is determined by @xmath94 , where @xmath51 in the integrand is the composition in the corresponding radiative model .",
    "when we integrate the basic equations from the surface to the bottom of the envelope so that @xmath87 at @xmath77 , there appears a strong density discontinuity due to the discontinuous change of compositions @xmath95 at the boundaries between the convection zone and the radiative regions , at which we assume the continuity of the pressure and the temperature .",
    "the envelope models thus constructed to have a convective zone are simply called convective models in this paper .",
    "for nonadiabatic and nonradial oscillations of rotating stars , we use the method of solution given by lee & saio ( 1987 , 1993 ) . throughout this paper , we apply the cowling approximation , neglecting the euler perturbation of the gravitational potential , @xmath96 . since separation of variables is not possible for global oscillations of rotating stars ,",

    "erecting at the equator a cartesian coordinate system in which the coordinates @xmath230 , @xmath163 , and @xmath231 are directed to the east , the north , and the zenith , respectively , and applying the @xmath67-plane approximation at the origin , we may obtain the dispersion relation for equatorial waves given by ( pedlosky 1987 ) @xmath232 where @xmath233 is the dimensionless wavenumber in the @xmath230 direction , and @xmath234 is the separation constant between the horizontal and vertical momentum equations , and the velocity perturbation @xmath235 , for example , have been assumed to have the form given by @xmath236 . here , the separation constant @xmath234 is determined by the vertical - structure equation that governs the function @xmath237 , and the non - negative - integer @xmath54 comes from the normal mode equation for @xmath235 , for which the function @xmath238 is shown to be proportional to @xmath239 , where @xmath240 is the hermite polynomial and @xmath241 ( pedlosky 1987 ) . in the dispersion relation ,",

    ", we obtain @xmath249 which can be solved for @xmath2 to give @xmath250 where we have assumed @xmath251 with @xmath5 being an integer corresponding to the azumutal wave number .",

    ", we obtain @xmath254 and we obtain at rapid rotation speeds @xmath255 which does not depend on @xmath1 .",
    "if we regard @xmath247 and @xmath246 as the pressure - scale - height @xmath256 and the characteristic value of @xmath257 found in the @xmath0-mode propagation region , the dispersion relation given above describes qualitatively well the @xmath1 dependence of the @xmath0-mode frequency @xmath2 obtained in this paper .",
    "the quantity @xmath258 in equation ( 29 ) may depend on parameters such as the surface gravity @xmath259 , the radius @xmath75 , and the mass accretion rate , and extensive model calculations would be required to see how the quantity @xmath258 depends on the parameters .",
    "note that the equatorial waves have large amplitudes at the equatorial regions but vanishing amplitudes at the poles as indicated by the function @xmath260 , the propeties of which are similar to those of the @xmath0-modes found in this paper .",
    "in this paper , we calculated the @xmath0-modes propagating in mass - accreting , nuclear burning , and geometrically thin envelopes on the surface of rotating neutron stars . in steady state approximation , we constructed thin envelope models which are fully radiative or have a convective region .",
    "the radiative and the convective models were intended to represent envelope structures in a late phase and in an early phase of an x - ray burst , respectively .",
    "the convective models have higher temperature and larger geometrical thickness than the corresponding radiative models .",
    "we find that the corotating - frame oscillation frequency @xmath2 of the fundamental @xmath0-modes of @xmath191 , which is asymptotic to @xmath261 $ ] when @xmath4 , becomes essentially insensitive to @xmath1 and gathers in a frequency range of @xmath8hz at rapid rotation rates .",
    "it is also found that the amplitudes of the @xmath0-modes at rapid rotation rates become well confined to the equatorial regions of the star .",
    "although the fundamental @xmath0-modes of the radiative envelope models are all pulsationally stable for the mass accretion rates considered in this paper , the @xmath0-modes of the convective models are driven unstable by nuclear burning in the convection zone .",
    "it is found that the inertial - frame oscillation frequency @xmath9 of the @xmath0-modes of given @xmath170 for the convective models becomes lower than that for the corresponding radiative models . in order to estimate possible magnitudes of the relative frequency changes of the @xmath0-modes during an x - ray burst , we calculated @xmath262 as a function of @xmath1 , where @xmath20 and @xmath19 are the oscillation frequencies of the fundamental @xmath0-modes in the radiaitve and the convective envelope models , respectively .",
    "we find that , if we consider the burst oscillations of @xmath14 300hz or @xmath14 600hz , the fundamental @xmath0-modes of @xmath263 with @xmath15 or @xmath16 can produce the relative frequency changes @xmath18 consistent with the observed relative frequency drifts of less than @xmath121% , although we need to consider the @xmath0-modes of @xmath6 much larger than @xmath17 for values of @xmath18 as small as @xmath120.001 .",
    "we also find that @xmath18 for the @xmath150 models is larger than that for the @xmath149 models , which may reflect the properties of nuclear flashes dependent on the mass accretion rates ( see , e.g. , fujimoto , hanawa , & miyaji 1981 ) and could be tested observationally .",
    "considering that the fundamental @xmath0-modes in the convective models are driven unstable by nuclear burning in the convective zone , it is tempting to postulate that the burst oscillations observed in x - ray bursts are produced by the @xmath0-modes of low indices @xmath191 that are excited in the early phase of the nuclear flash and survive until the tail , changing the frequency slightly according to the changes in the envelope structure .",
    "the @xmath0-mode scenario is consistent with the observations that indicate the existence of two frequencies separated by a few hz , since the fundamental @xmath0-modes of different @xmath6 s for a given @xmath5 could be excited simulataneously in a burst to have similar oscillation frequencies for rapidly rotating neutron stars .",
    "the temporal frequency decrease observed in the tail of bursts from 4u 1636 - 53 ( strohmayer 1999 ) and ks 1731 - 260 ( muno et al 2000 ) may be attributable to switching of the @xmath0-modes observable to us from those of ( @xmath5,@xmath264 ) to ( @xmath5,@xmath265 ) where @xmath266 for frequency decrease .",
    "the mode switching will cause discontinuous frequency changes and could be tested by a close observation of the frequency evolution . to make possible the close comparison between obervations and the @xmath0-mode scenario for burst oscillations , however , it is definitely necessary to use more realistic envelope models obtained from time - dependent flash calculation with a reliable treatment of the convection zone .",
    "recently , chakrabarty et al ( 2003 ) reported the detection of quasi - periodic oscillatons in x - ray bursts of the millisecond pulsar sax j1808.4 - 3658 , showing that the oscillation frequencies agree quite well with the spin frequency of the star .",
    "the time evolution of the burst oscillation frequencies , however , was found quite different from that in other x - ray bursters that show burst oscillations .",
    "the frequency drift @xmath267 is among the largest observed in any neutron star .",
    "the drift time scale is an order of magnitude faster than in the other neutron stars , and the oscillation frequency overshoots the spin frequency , reaching the maximum during the burst rise .",
    "the burst oscillations found in the pulsar are inconsistent with both the contracting shell model with angular momentum conservation and the @xmath0-mode scenario . a key factor for",
    "the burst oscillaitons in the star may be a strong magnetic field infered from the existence of coherent x - ray pulsations in non - burst phases , since the strong magnetic field has significant effects both on the modal properties of waves propagating in the surface layers and on the way of nuclear burning on the surface of the star .",
