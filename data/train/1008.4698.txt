    "complex fluids exhibit a rich variety of flow behaviour which depends sensitively upon the thermodynamic control parameters , details of the microscopic interparticle interactions and both the rate and specific geometry of the flow under consideration .",
    "the highly nonlinear response characteristic of complex fluids may be readily observed in a number of familiar household products @xcite .",
    "for example , mayonnaise consists of a stabilized emulsion of oil droplets suspended in water and behaves as a soft solid when stored on the shelf but flows like a liquid , and is thus easy to spread , when subjected to shear flow with a knife @xcite .",
    "this nonlinear viscoelastic flow behaviour , known as shear - thinning , may be manipulated on the microscopic level by careful control of the oil droplet size distribution .",
    "in contrast , a dispersion of corn - starch particles in water , at sufficiently high concentrations , exhibits a dramatic increase in shear viscosity with increasing shear rate ; a phenomenon called shear - thickening @xcite .",
    "even the familiar practical problem of extracting tomato ketchup from a glass bottle presents a highly nonlinear flow . in this case",
    "the applied shear stress , generally implemented by shaking , must exceed a critical value , the yield - stress , before the ketchup begins to flow as desired .",
    "colloidal dispersions are a class of complex fluid which display all of the above mentioned nonlinear flow responses @xcite .",
    "in addition to being of exceptional relevance for many technological processes , the considerable research interest in colloidal dispersions owes much to the existence of well characterized experimental systems for which the interparticle interactions may be tuned to relatively high precision ( often possible by simply varying the solvent conditions ) @xcite .",
    "the ability to control the microscopic details of the colloidal interaction facilitates comparison of experimental results with theoretical calculations and computer simulations based on idealised models ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the size of colloidal particles makes possible light scattering , neutron scattering and microscopy experiments which provide information inaccessible to experiments on atomic systems and which have enabled various aspects of liquid state theory to be tested in detail @xcite .",
    "the typical size of a colloidal particle lies in the range @xmath0 to @xmath1 and thus enables a fairly clear separation of length- and time - scales to be made between the colloids and the molecules of the solvent in which they are dispersed . as a result ,",
    "a reasonable first approximation is to represent the solvent as a continuum fluid , generally taken to be newtonian and thus characterised by a constant solvent viscosity ( see fig.[cg ] ) . for suspended particles with a length - scale greater than approximately @xmath1",
    "the continuum approximation of the solvent is completely appropriate .",
    "however , this becomes questionable as the average size of the particles is reduced below a few nanometers , at which point the discrete nature of the solvent can no longer be ignored .",
    "colloidal particles occupy an intermediate range of length - scales for which a continuum approximation for the solvent must be supplemented by the addition of first order gaussian fluctuations ( brownian motion ) about the average hydrodynamic fields describing the viscous flow of the continuum solvent .",
    "the brownian motion resulting from solvent fluctuations not only plays an important role in determining the microscopic dynamics ; it is essential for the existence of a unique equilibrium microstructure . with the important exception of arrested glasses and gels",
    ", the presence of a stochastic element to the particle motion allows a full exploration of the available phase space and thus enables application of boltzmann - gibbs statistical mechanics to quiescent ( and ergodic ) colloidal dispersions . while the specific nature of the balance between brownian motion , hydrodynamic and potential interactions depends upon both the observable under consideration and the range of system parameters under investigation , it is the simultaneous occurrence of these competing physical mechanisms which gives rise to the rich and varied rheological behaviour of dispersions .",
    "unfortunately , the complicated microscopic dynamics presented by dispersions also serves to complicate the theoretical description of these systems @xcite .",
    "the present review has been written with a number of aims in mind .",
    "on one hand , we would like to present a relatively concise overview of the main phenomenological features of the rheology of dispersions of spherical colloidal particles . in order to reduce the parameter space of the discussion",
    ", emphasis will be placed on the simple hard sphere model for which the space of control parameters is restricted to two dimensions ( volume fraction and flow rate ) .",
    "while both attractive colloids and the response to non - shear flows will be addressed , no attempt has been made to be comprehensive in this respect .",
    "another primary aim of the present work is to provide an overview , within the context of the aforementioned phenomenology , of microscopically motivated approaches to the rheology and flow induced microstructure of colloidal dispersions .",
    "although we will discuss some less well founded ` schematic model ' approaches , the focus here is upon ` first - principles ' theories which prescribe a route to go from a well defined microscopic dynamics to closed expressions for macroscopically measurable quantities .",
    "the formulation of a robust theory of dispersion rheology from microscopic starting points constitutes a formidable problem in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "although considerable progress has been made in this direction , a comprehensive constitutive theory analogous to that of doi and edwards for entangled linear polymers @xcite remains to be found . at present there",
    "exist a number of alternative microscopic theoretical approaches to dispersion rheology which , despite showing admirable success within limited ranges of the system parameters , have so far been unable to provide a unified global picture of the microscopic mechanisms underlying the rheology of colloidal dispersions . despite common starting points ( the many - body smoluchowski equation ) the disparate nature of the subsequent approximations , each tailored to capture a particular physical aspect of the cooperative particle motion ,",
    "make it difficult to establish clear relations between different theoretical approaches .",
    "a goal of this work is thus to clarify the range of validity of the various theoretical approaches and to identify common ground .",
    "we note that the present work is well complemented by a number of recent reviews addressing dispersion rheology from both experimental @xcite and theoretical perspectives @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ cont ] we will discuss briefly some traditional continuum mechanics approaches to rheology , both to give a feeling for the spirit of such work and to put into context some of the microscopic results presented later ( in section [ section : mct ] ) . in section [ section : dynamics ] we will introduce and discuss in some detail the smoluchowski equation defining the microscopic dynamics under consideration . in section [ quiescent ]",
    "we will consider the equilibrium and non - equilibrium phase behaviour of hard - sphere colloids in the absence of flow , which is a necessary pre - requisite to the subsequent discussions . in section [ phenom ] we will give a brief overview of the relevant basic phenomenology of dispersion rheology , including the shear - thinning and shear - thickening of colloidal fluids and the yielding of colloidal glasses . in section [ flowing ] we will consider the various theoretical approaches to treating colloidal fluids under external flow . in particular , exact results for the microstructure and rheology of low volume fraction systems and their ( approximate ) extension to finite fluid volume fractions are discussed in subsections [ section : brady ] and [ section : integralequations ] , respectively . in section [ section :",
    "mct ] , we consider the recently developed mode - coupling based approaches to the rheology of dense colloidal suspensions which enable glass rheology to be addressed",
    ". finally , in section [ section : outlook ] we will provide an outlook for future work and identify possible new avenues for theoretical investigation .",
    "rheology is primarily an experimental discipline . indeed ,",
    "one of the simplest experiments imaginable is to exert a force on a material in order to see how it deforms in response .",
    "more precisely , in a controlled rheological experiment one measures either the stress arising from a given strain or , more commonly , the strain accumulated following application of an applied stress . in practice ,",
    "both stress controlled and strain controlled experiments are performed and provide complementary information regarding the response of a material sample . for the purpose of this review we will focus upon situations in which a _ homogeneous _ strain field is prescribed from the outset .",
    "the description of experiments for which macroscopic stress is employed as a control parameter poses an enormous challenge for microscopically based theories and demands careful consideration of the nontrivial mechanisms by which the applied stress propagates into the sample from the boundaries .    given the apparent complexity of any microscopic theory , it is quite natural to begin first at a more coarse - grained level of description in an effort to establish the general phenomenology and mathematical structure of the governing equations at the continuum level .",
    "historically , this methodology was pioneered by maxwell in his 1863 work on viscoelasticity and continued to develop into the following century through the efforts of distinguished rheologists such as rivlin and oldroyd @xcite . while much of this early work aimed to acheive a more fundamental mathematical understanding of viscoelastic response , strong additional motivation was provided by experiments on polymeric systems which exposed a large variety of interesting nonlinear rheological phenomena in need of theoretical explanation .",
    "theoretical approaches to continuum rheology thus seek to obtain a constitutive equation relating the stress , a tensorial quantity describing the forces acting on the system @xcite , to the deformation history encoded in the strain tensor .",
    "the typical ` rational mechanics ' approach to this problem is to assume a sufficiently general integral or differential constitutive relation between stress and strain and to then constrain this as much as possible via the imposition of certain exact or approximate macroscopic symmetry , conservation and invariance principles @xcite .",
    "the clear drawback to this methodology is that the entire particulate system is viewed as a single continuum field , thus losing any contact to the underlying colloidal interactions and microstructure ultimately responsible for the macroscopic response ( see fig.1 ) . as a result ,",
    "such constitutive theories are neither material - specific nor genuinely predictive in character . despite these shortcomings ,",
    "the continuum mechanics approach to rheology has attained a great level of refinement and can be applied to fit experimental data from a wide range of physical systems @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the experience gained through continuum mechanics modelling may well prove useful in guiding the construction of more sophisticated microscopic theories by providing constraints on the admissable mathematical form of the constitutive equations .",
    "it is perhaps instructive to give an illustration of the spirit in which phenomenological constitutive relations may be constructed using continuum mechanics concepts .",
    "the example we choose is not only of intrinsic interest , but will also prove relevant to the discussion of a recent microscopically based theory of glass rheology @xcite to be discussed in section [ section : mct ] .",
    "we consider a viscoelastic fluid subject to shear deformation with flow in the @xmath2-direction and shear gradient in the @xmath3-direction ( a convention we will continue to employ throughout the present work ) .",
    "suppose that we wish to determine the infinitessimal shear stress @xmath4 at time @xmath5 arising from a small strain increment @xmath6 at an earlier time @xmath7 . as the material is viscoelastic , it is reasonable to assume that the influence of the strain increment @xmath8 on the stress at time @xmath5 must be weighted by a decaying function of the intervening time @xmath9 , in order to represent the influence of dissipative processes .",
    "adopting a simple exponential form for the relaxation function it is thus intuitive to write @xmath10\\dot\\gamma(t')\\,dt ' , \\label{small}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is a relaxation time and @xmath12 is an elastic constant ( the infinite frequency shear modulus ) .",
    "assuming linearity , the total stress at time @xmath5 may thus be constructed by summing up all of the infinitessimal contributions over the entire flow history , which we take to extend into the infinite past .",
    "we thus arrive at @xmath13\\dot\\gamma(t').\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] partial integration leads finally to @xmath14 where @xmath15 $ ] is the shear modulus and @xmath16 is the accumulated strain @xmath17 .",
    "the simple integral relation ( [ boltzmann ] ) between shear stress and shear strain was first considered by boltzmann .",
    "indeed , the assumption that the stress increments ( [ small ] ) may be summed linearly to obtain the total stress is often referred to as the ` boltzmann superposition principle ' .    in order to extend ( [ boltzmann ] ) to a tensorial relation , i.e. a true constitutive equation",
    ", an appropriate tensorial generalization of the accumulated strain @xmath16 must be identified . for the spatially homogeneous deformations under consideration",
    "the translationally invariant deformation gradient tensor @xmath18 transforms a vector ( ` material line ' ) at time @xmath7 to a new vector at later time @xmath5 via @xmath19 , where @xmath20 .",
    "an alternative nonlinear choice of strain measure is the symmetric finger tensor @xmath21 .",
    "the finger tensor contains information about the stretching of material lines during a deformation but is invariant with respect to solid body rotations of the material sample . for simple",
    "shear the finger tensor is given explicitly by @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "the accumulated strain in the integrand of eq.([boltzmann ] ) can thus be identified as the xy element of @xmath24 .",
    "this suggests that the boltmann integral form ( [ boltzmann ] ) may be extended using the simple ansatz @xmath25 for the full stress tensor ( see subsection [ matob ] below for more justification of this nontrivial step ) .",
    "equation ( [ lodge1 ] ) is known as the lodge equation in the rheological literature and is applicable in both the linear and nonlinear viscoelastic regime @xcite .",
    "the assumption of an exponentially decaying shear modulus is generally attributed to maxwell , who realized that this choice enabled an interpolation between a purely elastic response to deformations rapid on the time scale set by @xmath11 and a viscous , dissipative response in the limit of slowly varying strain fields .",
    "in fact , the lodge equation derived above is simply the integral form of a nonlinear ( differential ) maxwell equation . in order to show this we first differentiate ( [ lodge1 ] ) to obtain @xmath26 where we have introduced the upper - convected derivative @xcite @xmath27 and where the velocity gradient tensor @xmath28 is defined in terms of the deformation gradient tensor via @xmath29 for an incompressible material the stress",
    "is only determined up to a constant isotropic term .",
    "eq.([upper_maxwell ] ) may thus be expressed in an alternative form by first defining a new stress tensor @xmath30 and substituting for @xmath31 in eq.([upper_maxwell ] ) .",
    "this yields @xmath32 this differential form of the lodge equation is known as the upper - convected maxwell equation @xcite and is a nonlinear generalization of maxwell s original scalar model to the full deviatoric stress tensor .",
    "historically , the upper - convected maxwell equation was first proposed by oldroyd @xcite directly on the basis of maxwell s differential form .",
    "the assumption that one can go from ( [ boltzmann ] ) to ( [ lodge1 ] ) on the basis of a single off - diagonal element appears at first glance to be rather _",
    "ad hoc_. on one hand , this choice can be justified retrospectively , using the fact that the lodge equation ( [ lodge1 ] ) is derivable from a number of simple molecular models , e.g. the dumbell model for dilute polymer solutions @xcite .",
    "however , from a continuum mechanics perspective ( [ lodge1 ] ) is the simplest generalization of ( [ boltzmann ] ) which satisfies the ` principle of material objectivity ' .",
    "this principle expresses the requirement that the constitutive relationship between stress and strain tensors should be invariant with respect to rotation of either the material body or the observer , thus preventing an unphysical dependence of the stress on the state of rotation . that this symmetry is",
    "an approximation becomes clear when considering the material from a microscopic viewpoint : in a noninertial rotating frame the apparent forces clearly lead to particle trajectories which depend upon the angular velocity .",
    "for many systems the neglect of these effects on the macroscopic response of the system is an extremely good approximation .",
    "for the overdamped colloidal dynamics considered in this work inertia plays no role and the principle of material objectivity is exact @xcite .",
    "mathematically , it is straightforward to check whether or not a proposed tensorial constitutive equation is material objective .",
    "when subject to a time - dependent rotation @xmath33 the deformation gradient tensor transforms as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the deformation gradient in the rotating frame .",
    "the dependence of @xmath35 upon the state of rotation arises because @xmath36 contains information about both the stretching and rotation of material lines .",
    "insertion of the transformed tensor ( [ rotatione ] ) into the constitutive equation for the stress thus corresponds to a rotation of the material sample .",
    "material objectivity is verified if the resulting stress tensor is given by @xmath37 as noted , the finger tensor @xmath38 contains only information about the stretching of material lines and transforms under rotation according to @xmath39 the material objectivity of the lodge equation ( [ lodge1 ] ) , and thus the upper convected maxwell equation ( [ ucm ] ) , follows trivially from the fact that @xmath31 is a linear functional of @xmath38 .",
    "many phenomenological rheological models thus start by assuming a general functional dependence @xmath40 $ ] in order to guarantee a rotationally invariant theory .",
    "the vast majority of microscopically motivated theories of dispersion rheology treat only a single scalar element of the stress tensor ( generally the shear stress @xmath41 ) .",
    "indeed , the rarity of microscopic tensorial constitutive theories may well be the primary reason for the apparent gap between continuum and statistical mechanical theories aiming to describe common phenomena .",
    "we will revisit the concept of material objectivity in section [ section : mct ] when considering a recently proposed tensorial constitutive equation for dense dispersions .      in the last decade , significant progress has been made in understanding the response of colloidal dispersions to exernal flow on a level which goes beyond the fully coarse - grained phenomenological approaches of traditional continuum rheology .",
    "important steps towards a more refined picture have been provided by studies based on mesoscopic models @xcite .",
    "however , while such phenomenological approaches can reveal generic features of the rheological response , they are not material specific and can therefore address neither the influence of the microscopic interactions on the macroscopic rheology nor the underlying microstructure , as encoded in the particle correlation functions .",
    "this deeper level of insight is provided by fully microscopic approaches which start from a well defined particle dynamics and , via a sequence of either exact or clearly specified approximate steps , lead to closed expressions for macroscopically measureable quantities . the symmetry , invariance and conservation principles used as input in the construction of continuum theories , such as the material objectivity discussed in section [ matob ] ,",
    "should then emerge directly as a consequence of the microscopic interactions .",
    "such an undertaking clearly requires the machinery of statistical mechanics .",
    "theories founded in statistical mechanics provide information regarding the correlated motion of the constituent particles and are thus capable , at least in principle , of capturing non - trivial and potentially unexpected cooperative behaviour as exhibited by equilibrium and nonequilibrium phase transitions .",
    "this ability to capture emergent phenomena is in clear contrast to continuum approaches where such physical mechanisms must be input by hand .",
    "an additional advantage of a statistical mechanics based approach to rheology over the direct application of continuum mechanics is that important additional information is provided regarding the microstructure of the system , as encoded in the correlation functions .",
    "it thus becomes possible to connect the constitutive relations to the underlying correlations between the colloidal particles and obtain microscopic insight into the macroscopic rheological response .",
    "additional motivation to theoretically ` look inside ' the flowing system is provided by developments in the direct visualization and tracking of particle motion in experiments on colloidal dispersions ( confocal microscopy ) @xcite , together with advances in the computer simulation of model systems under flow @xcite .",
    "although beyond the scope of the present work , we note that the influence of steady shear flow on glassy states has been addressed , albeit in an abstract setting , by generalized mean - field theories of spin glasses @xcite .",
    "spin glass approaches have proved useful in describing the dynamical behaviour of quiescent systems @xcite . in order to mimic the effect of shear flow a nonconservative force",
    "is introduced to bias the dynamics and break the condition of detailed balance characterizing the equilibrium state @xcite .",
    "while the abstract nature of these treatments certainly lends them a powerful generality , the lack of material specificity makes difficult a direct connection to experiment .",
    "before addressing the phenomenology ( section [ phenom ] ) and approximate theories ( sections [ flowing ] and [ section : mct ] ) of colloid rheology it is rewarding to first consider in detail the microscopic equation of motion determining the overdamped colloidal dynamics . by a careful assessment of the fundamental equation of motion a number of general observations and comments can be made regarding the character of nonequilibrium states , solutions in special limits , important dimensionless parameters and influence of hydrodynamics , which are independent of the specific system or approximation scheme under consideration .",
    "we consider a system consisting of @xmath42 brownian colloidal particles interacting via spherically symmetric pairwise additive interactions and homogeneously dispersed in an incompressible newtonian fluid of given viscosity .",
    "the probability distribution of the @xmath42-particle configuration is denoted by @xmath43 and satisfies the smoluchowski equation @xcite @xmath44 where the probability flux of particle @xmath45 is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the inverse temperature .",
    "the hydrodynamic velocity of particle @xmath45 due to the applied flow is denoted by @xmath48 and the diffusion tensor @xmath49 describes ( via the mobility tensor @xmath50 ) the hydrodynamic mobility of particle @xmath45 resulting from a force on particle @xmath51 .",
    "the hydrodynamic velocity can be decomposed into affine and particle induced fluctuation terms @xmath52 , where @xmath53 can be expressed in terms of the third rank hydrodynamic resistance tensor @xcite .",
    "the force @xmath54 on particle @xmath51 is generated from the total potential energy according to @xmath55 , where , in the absence of external fields , @xmath56 depends solely on the relative particle positions .",
    "the three terms contributing to the flux thus represent the competing effects of ( from left to right in ( [ flux ] ) ) external flow , diffusion and interparticle interactions .    while the smoluchowski equation ( [ smol_hydro ] ) is widely accepted as an appropriate starting point for the treatment of colloidal dynamics , alternative approaches based on the fokker - planck equation",
    "have also been investigated @xcite . on the fokker - planck level of description",
    "the distribution function retains a dependence on the particle momenta .",
    "although this makes possible the treatment of systems with a temperature gradient ( leading to thermophoretic effects ) , considerable complications arise when attempting to treat hydrodynamic interactions which make preferable the smoluchowski equation .    for the special case of monodisperse hard - spheres at finite volume fractions under steady flow eq.([smol_hydro ] ) can be numerically integrated over the entire fluid range using computationally intensive stokesian dynamics simulation @xcite .",
    "this simulation technique includes the full solvent hydrodynamics and provides a useful benchmark for theoretical approaches ( for an overview of the computer simulation of viscous dispersions we refer the reader to @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "while stokesian dynamics simulations have focused primarily on simple shear , results have also been reported for extensional flow geometries @xcite .",
    "for the special case of non - interacting particles ( @xmath57 ) equations ( [ smol_hydro ] ) and ( [ flux ] ) describe the configurational probability distribution of an ideal gas under externally applied flow and may be solved analytically using the method of characteristics @xcite . for non - interacting particles under steady shear the many - particle distribution function is given by a product of single particle functions @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is given by @xmath60}\\notag \\\\",

    "the normalization is given by @xmath62 and the strain by @xmath63 .",
    "given a suitably localized initial density distribution eq.([ideal ] ) essentially describes the dispersion of a colloidal droplet in a solvent ( e.g. ink in water ) under shear , as is apparent from fig.[idealgas ] , which shows contour plots of the probability distribution at three different times for a given shear rate .",
    "( see eq.[ideal ] ) in the @xmath64 plane at times @xmath65 and @xmath66 , demonstrating shear induced anisotropy for @xmath67 related to the onset of taylor dispersion . ,",
    "width=321 ]    although non - interacting colloids represent a trivial case , it is nevertheless instructive to consider the mean - squared - displacement ( msd ) , characterizing the diffusive particle motion , both parallel and orthogonal to the flow direction in simple shear @xcite . in both the vorticity and shear gradient directions , flow has no influence and the equilibrium result is recovered , @xmath68 , with @xmath69 the single particle diffusion coefficient . in the flow direction",
    "the msd is enhanced by a coupling between brownian motion and affine advection , yielding @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the shear rate .",
    "the physical origin of this enhanced diffusion , termed ` taylor dispersion ' @xcite , is that the random motion of a given colloid leads to its displacement into planes of laminar flow with a velocity different to that of the original point .",
    "this constant and random ` changing of lanes ' leads , on the average , to a dramatically increased rate of diffusion in the direction of flow . the accelerated rate of mixing achieved by stirring a dilute dispersion is thus almost entirely attributable to local taylor dispersion .",
    "we note also that analogous effects arising from flow - diffusion coupling can also be identified in other flow geometries , such as the practically relevant case of poiseuille flow along a cylindrical tube @xcite .",
    "the smoluchowski equation describes the dynamics of spherical colloidal particles dispersed in an incompressible newtonian fluid and provides the fundamental starting point for all theoretical work to be described in the following sections .",
    "an appropriate dimensionless reynolds number governing the solvent flow may be defined as @xmath72 , with @xmath71 a characteristic flow rate , @xmath73 is the density , @xmath74 the solvent viscosity and @xmath75 the colloidal length scale . due to the small size of the colloidal particles @xmath76 remains small for all situations of physical relevance and the stokes equations , rather than the more complicated navier - stokes equations , may thus be employed in treating the solvent flow .    given that @xmath76 remains small , two dimensionless parameters are of particular importance in determining the equilibrium and nonequilibrium behaviour .",
    "the first of these is the colloidal volume fraction @xmath77 , with number density @xmath78 and particle radius @xmath75 . the maximum volume fraction achievable for monodisperse spheres is @xmath79 corresponding to an optimally packed face - centered - cubic crystal structure . for the purposes of the present work we will find it convenient to divide the physical range of volume fractions into three subregions : ( i ) low packing , @xmath80 , ( ii ) intermediate packing , @xmath81 , and ( iii ) high packing , @xmath82 . while this division is somewhat arbitrary , it will later prove useful in discussing the various theoretical approximation schemes currently available .",
    "the second important dimensionless parameter is the peclet number @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "the peclet number is a measure of the importance of advection relative to brownian motion and determines the extent to which the microstructure is distorted away from equilibrium by the flow field . in the limit @xmath84 brownian motion dominates and the thermodynamic equilibrium state is recovered .",
    "conversely , in the strong flow limit , @xmath85 , solvent mediated hydrodynamic interactions may be expected to dominate the particle dynamics , although , in practice , surface roughness and other perturbing effects turn out to complicate this limit @xcite ( see section [ section : brady ] for more details on this point ) .    finally , we would like to note that there exists a further , nontrivial dimensionless quantity implicit in the many - body smoluchowski equation ( [ smol_hydro ] ) .",
    "an increase in either the dispersion volume fraction or attractive coupling between particles is accompanied by an increase in the structural relaxation timescale of the system @xmath86 characterizing the temporal decay of certain two - point autocorrelation functions .",
    "this enables the weissenberg number to be defined as @xmath87 . for intermediate and high volume fractions , particularly those close to the colloidal glass transition , it is the weissenberg number , rather than the ` bare ' peclet number @xmath88 , which dominates certain aspects of the nonlinear rheological response , as has been emphasized in @xcite . for the low volume fraction systems to be considered in section [ section : brady ]",
    "the structural relaxation timescale is set by @xmath89 , leading to @xmath90 .",
    "in many approximate theories aiming to describe intermediate and high volume - fraction dispersions the influence of solvent hydrodynamics beyond trivial advection is neglected from the outset . for certain situations ( e.g. glasses )",
    "this approximation is partially motivated by physical intuition , however , in most cases , the omission of solvent hydrodynamics is an undesirable but unavoidable compromise made in order to achieve tractable closed expressions .",
    "accordingly , the expression for the probability flux ( [ flux ] ) is approximated in two places , which we will now discuss in turn .",
    "the first approximation is to set @xmath91 , thus neglecting the influence of the configuration of the @xmath42 colloidal particles on the mobility of a given particle .",
    "for low and intermediate volume fraction fluids this may be reasonable for @xmath92 but can be expected to break down for @xmath93 as hydrodynamics becomes increasingly important in determining the particle trajectories .",
    "in particular , the near field lubrication forces @xcite which reduce the mobility when the surfaces of two particles approach contact play an important role in strong flow and are responsible for driving cluster formation and shear thickening @xcite ( see section [ thickening ] ) . for dense colloidal suspensions close to a glass transition",
    "the role of hydrodynamics is less clear . for certain situations of interest ( e.g. glasses close to yield )",
    "the relevant value of @xmath88 is very small and suggests that hydrodynamic couplings should not be of primary importance .",
    "the second common approximation to ( [ flux ] ) arising from the neglect of solvent hydrodynamics is the assumption of a translationally invariant linear flow profile @xmath94 , where @xmath28 is the ( traceless ) time - dependent velocity gradient tensor introduced in eq.([velocity_gradient ] ) . in an exact calculation the solvent flow field follows from solution of stokes equations with the surfaces of the @xmath42 colloidal particles in a given configuration providing the boundary conditions ( essentially what is done in stokesian dynamics simulation @xcite ) . by replacing this solvent velocity field with the affine flow ,",
    "we neglect the need for the solvent to flow around the particles and are thus able to fully specify the solvent flow profile from the outset , without requiring that this be determined as part of a self consistent calculation @xcite . if necessary",
    ", the assumption of purely affine flow could be corrected to first order . for example , under simple shear flow the solvent flow profile around a single spherical particle is well known @xcite and could form the basis of a superposition - type approximation to the full fluctuating velocity field .",
    "it is important to note that the assumption of a translationally invariant velocity gradient @xmath28 is potentially rather severe as it excludes from the outset the possibility of inhomogeneous flow , as observed in shear banded and shear localized states .",
    "while physically reasonable for low and intermediate density colloidal fluids , the assumption of homogeneity could become questionable when considering the flow response of dynamically arrested states , for which brittle fracture may preclude plastic flow @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is implicit in the approximation @xmath95 that the imposed flow profile acts instantaneously throughout the system . in experiments where strain or stress are applied at the sample boundaries a finite time",
    "is required for transverse momentum diffusion to establish the velocity field .",
    "nevertheless , experiments and simulations of the transition from equilibrium to homogeneous steady state flow have shown that a linear velocity profile is established long before the steady state regime is approached , thus suggesting that the assumption of an instantaneous translationally invariant flow is acceptable for certain colloidal systems @xcite .      in equilibrium",
    ", the principle of detailed balance asserts that the microscopic probability flux vanishes , @xmath96 , where @xmath56 is the total interparticle potential energy .",
    "this balance between conservative and brownian forces thus yields the familiar boltmann - gibbs distribution @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the configurational part of the canonical partition function . in the presence of flow ( @xmath99 )",
    "there exists a finite probability current which breaks the time reversal symmetry of the equilibrium state and detailed balance no longer applies . a nonvanishing probability current thus serves to distinguish between equilibrium and nonequilibrium solutions of ( [ smol_hydro ] ) and rules out the possibility of a boltzmann - gibbs form for the nonequilibrium distribution .",
    "while such a boltzmann - gibbs distribution is clearly inadequate for nonpotential flows ( e.g. simple shear ) , for potential flows ( e.g. planar elongation ) it is perhaps tempting to assume such a distribution by employing an effective ` flow potential ' @xmath100 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "it should also be noted that within the russel - gast approach the function @xmath228 is an input , which can be calculated using either simulation or equilibrium statistical mechanical approximations ( see subsection [ eq_integral ] ) .",
    "the linear equation resulting from combining equations ( [ pair_smol ] ) and ( [ gast_approx ] ) has been solved for hard - spheres in weak shear flow @xcite . in these calculations ,",
    "simple approximations were employed to determine the hydrodynamic functions @xmath201 and @xmath202 entering equations ( [ diff_tensor ] ) and ( [ resistance ] ) defining the conditionally averaged hydrodynamic tensors which represent the effective medium ( solvent@xmath279 colloids ) in which the chosen pair of particles are immersed .",
    "results were obtained for the zero - shear viscosity , linear response moduli @xmath280 under small amplitude oscillatory shear and the leading order flow induced distortion of @xmath207 ( via determination of the function @xmath234 , see eq.([eq : lowrhosol ] ) ) .",
    "for @xmath281 good agreement with experiment was obtained for the integrated quantities @xmath282 and @xmath283 , despite providing only a poor description of the microstructure ( see fig.6 in @xcite ) .",
    "an interesting feature of the russel - gast theory is that the predicted zero - shear viscosity becomes very large in the vicinity of random - close - packing ( @xmath269 ) , although the precise nature of this rapid increase as a function of volume fraction remains to be studied in detail .",
    "the apparent divergence of @xmath115 is a non - trivial output of the theory , given that the approximate verlet - weiss expression for @xmath228 used as input diverges only at @xmath284 @xcite . when viewed within the context of the time - correlation / green - kubo formalism ( see subsection [ zero_shear ] ) it is tempting to infer that the observed growth in @xmath115 is related to the development of an underlying slow structural relaxation time .",
    "the solution of eq.([gast_approx ] ) for small amplitude oscillatory shear at finite frequencies would enable this issue to be addressed .",
    "the russel - gast theory outlined above neglects the influence of external flow on the triplet correlation function , which leads to a force @xmath273 generated from the equilibrium potential of mean force ( eq.([gast_approx ] ) ) . in order to go beyond this close - to - equilibrium ansatz it is neccessary to express the force @xmath273 as a functional of @xmath207 , such that both functions can be determined self - consistently .",
    "a promising approach in this direction is to generalize equilibrium liquid - state integral equation theory @xcite to treat the nonequilibrium problem .",
    "it will thus be useful to review briefly some concepts from the equilibrium theory before moving on to more unfamiliar territory in the next subsection .",
    "integral equation theories generally aim to calculate the equilibrium pair correlation function @xmath228 from knowledge of the interaction potential in a non - perturbative fashion .",
    "fundamental to the integral equation approach is the ornstein - zernicke ( oz ) equation which , for a translationally invariant system , is given by the convolution form @xcite @xmath285 where @xmath286 .",
    "the direct correlation function @xmath287 defined by ( [ oz ] ) is a function of simpler structure than @xmath288 and is thus easier to approximate . when supplemented by an independent closure relation between @xmath287 and @xmath288",
    ", containing details of the interaction potential under consideration , ( [ oz ] ) provides a closed equation for the pair correlations ( note that for pairwise additive potentials the triplet distribution does not enter explicitly ) .",

    "two closures of particular merit are the hyper - netted - chain ( hnc ) and percus - yevick ( py ) , given by @xmath291 respectively .",
    "an additional practical advantage of theories based on ( [ oz ] ) over superposition - type approaches is that the convolution form of the integral term enables self consistent solutions to be obtained using efficient iterative numerical algorithms @xcite .",
    "although the majority of integral equation theories focus on the pair correlations , triplet correlations can also be handled within the same framework @xcite .",
    "in addition to providing a higher level of resolution , the development of triplet - level integral equations is motivated by the desire for an improved description of the pair correlations .",
    "exact relations , such as the ybg equation ( [ meanforce ] ) , connect the triplet to the pair correlations and the expectation is that errors in an approximate @xmath292 may be averaged out by integration to the pair level . during the mid-1960s many of the leading liquid - state theorists proposed integral equations for the triplet correlations ( e.g. verlet @xcite , wertheim @xcite , baxter @xcite , stell @xcite ) , all of which showed considerable promise .",
    "however , the complexity of solving the equations has hindered progress along this route and somewhat simpler , numerically tractable , theories now seem preferable @xcite .    an integral equation which will be of particular relevance for the following section was derived by scherwinski @xcite . within the scherwinski approximation the triplet correlation function",
    "is obtained from self - consistent solution of the following linear equation @xmath293 iteration of eq.([triplet ] ) yields an infinite series expressing the triplet correlation function as a functional of the pair correlation function @xmath228 .",
    "substitution of this series into the exact ybg equation ( [ meanforce ] ) yields a diagrammatic expansion for @xmath228 in perfect agreement with that arising from solution of eqs.([oz ] ) , ( [ bridge ] ) and ( [ hnc ] ) . in this sense ,",
    "eq.([triplet ] ) represents a triplet generalization of the more familiar pair - level hnc theory .",
    "the more powerful approximations proposed by earlier workers @xcite probably provide a superior description of the triplet correlations than eq.([triplet ] ) and would , upon substitution into the ybg equation , lead to improved ( i.e. better than standard hnc ) estimate of the pair correlations .",
    "however , the scherwinski approximation has a number of purely technical advantages which make it particularly suitable for application to non - equilibrium situations and which are convenient for numerical implementation ( see also @xcite , which predates @xcite , but contains several of the key ideas ) .      in order to go beyond the russel - gast approximation @xcite outlined in subsection [ sec : meanforce ] , lionberger and russel employed the scherwinski equation for the triplet correlation function ( [ triplet ] ) in order to estimate the force ( [ force ] ) entering the pair smoluchowski equation @xcite .",
    "nonequilibrium pair and triplet correlations are thus determined self consistently and are both influenced by the externally imposed flow . it should be noted that the direct application of an equilibrium relation , such as eq.([triplet ] ) , to nonequilibrium ignores the fact that nonequilibrium states are intrinsically different from equilibrium and thus represents a major approximation .",
    "the original version of the lionberger - russel theory presented in @xcite neglected hydrodynamic interactions and has been implemented numerically for weak flows only .",
    "no results beyond leading order in @xmath88 have been presented , although in principle the theory remains valid also in the nonlinear regime . for @xmath294",
    "the lr theory makes predictions for the zero - shear viscosity , self - diffusion cooefficient and distorted microstructure in reasonable agreement with available computer simulation results . for @xmath295 significant quantitative deviations",
    "appear and the theory becomes unreliable .",
    "we note that the study @xcite considered a suspension interacting via a continuous repulsive potential which was then mapped onto a hard - sphere system .",
    "the input equilibrium microstructure was generated using the rogers - young integral equation @xcite ( an interpolation between py and hnc ) , despite the fact that the @xmath84 limit of the theory reduces to the hnc approximation for @xmath228 .",
    "although the lionberger - russel theory @xcite provides a sophisticated treatment of the microstructural distortion by incorporating the triplet correlations into the self - consistency loop , it is interesting that the results for @xmath115 are inferior to those from the much simpler russel - gast theory @xcite at high volume fractions . in particular ,",
    "the former predicts only a relatively weak growth of @xmath115 with volume fraction , whereas the latter suggests a divergence .",
    "calculations of the linear moduli @xmath296 as a function of frequency have been performed using the lr theory and , perplexingly , reveal a structural relaxation time which decreases with increasing volume fraction .",
    "this unphysical prediction would appear to be at odds with the growth of @xmath115 output from the theory and represents a weak point of the approach , in need of clarification @xcite .",
    "we note that the only approximation invoked by the lionberger - russel theory is the scherwinski closure ( [ triplet ] ) for the triplet correlation function .",
    "it would therefore be interesting , albeit numerically demanding , to see whether any of the more sophisticated triplet closures available @xcite can improve the performance at higher volume fractions .    the theory developed in @xcite omitted hydrodynamic interactions in order to make clearer the approximations to the many - body thermodynamic couplings and to facilitate comparision with brownian dynamics simulation results .",
    "in @xcite hydrodynamic interactions were included into the theory of @xcite in order to make closer contact with experiment .",
    "the hydrodynamic approximations developed were found to be of the correct magnitude but errors in the underlying thermodynamic approximation , namely the scherwinski equation ( [ triplet ] ) , led to an underestimation of the magnitude of the nonequilibrium structure .",
    "it was identified that the magnitude of the flow induced structural distortion is determined by the slow structural relaxation in the system ( a finding supported by subsequent theoretical studies @xcite ) , which , taken together with the results for the volume fraction dependence of the linear response moduli , suggests that the integral equation approach does not capture the slow dynamics characteristic of dense systems .",
    "wagner and russel @xcite developed an integral equation approach closely related to that of lionberger and russel in which the nonequilibrium triplet correlations are approximated using a closure motivated by the py equilibrium theory ( [ py ] ) .",
    "although use of a py - type closure ensures that excluded - volume packing constraints are treated realistically , at least close to equilibrium , the theory of @xcite included hydrodynamic interactions by employing only the low density limit of the pair hydrodynamic functions @xmath201 and @xmath202 entering eqs.([diff_tensor ] ) and ( [ resistance ] ) .",
    "the simultaneous introduction of hydrodynamic and thermodynamic approximations in @xcite served to obscure the validity of the proposed nonequilibrium py approximation .    when using integral equation methods to tackle the triplet corelations in nonequilibrium it is important to bear in mind that the physical situation is intrinsically different from that in equilibrium .",
    "consequently , caution must be exercised when attempting to apply trusted and familiar results from equilibrium statistical mechanics to system under flow . in order to appreciate",
    "more clearly the approximations involved in applying equilibrium triplet closures to the pair smoluchowski equation both lionberger and russel @xcite and szamel @xcite have invoked the concept of a ` fictitious ' flow dependent two - body potential @xmath297 . in a study of the kinetic theory of hard - spheres resibois and",

    "both @xmath207 and its fourier transform @xmath309 were found to be qualitatively similar to those from the lionberger - russel theory , substantially underestimating the magnitude of the distortion from equilibrium when compared to brownian dynamics simulation .    in an early study ,",

    "transport coefficients are related to integrals over time correlation functions @xcite .",
    "the growth of the shear viscosity as a function of volume fraction is thus related to an increasingly slow decay of the stress autocorrelation function .",
    "what is lacking thus far in the discussion of the pair smoluchowski equation and its approximate solutions , is the connection between the temporally local eqs.([pair_smol ] ) and ( [ stress ] ) and the nonlocal expressions ( [ lr ] ) and ( [ nlr ] ) fundamental to the time - correlation function formalism .",
    "moreover , the memory kernels characteristic of the time - correlation approach ( and widely employed in continuum mechanics approaches , see section [ cont ] ) make no explicit appearance within the pair smoluchowski framework .    the key to understanding the connection between the nonlocal time - correlation formalism and approaches based on the local pair smoluchowski equation lies in the study of time - dependent external flow fields . indeed , it is the absence of time - dependent data from the pair smoluchowski approach which has served to obscure the relationship between these two methods , despite the fact that they are formally equivalent .",
    "the only available smoluchowski - based time - dependent calculations were performed using the lionberger - russel theory @xcite for small amplitude oscillatory shear flow . as pointed out in subsection [ sec : noneq ] , the available results for the volume fraction dependence of @xmath311 and @xmath312 within the lr theory reveal underlying problems resulting from the approximations employed ( i.e. a reduction of @xmath86 with increasing @xmath116 ) which would otherwise have gone unnoticed . this serves to emphasize the importance of going beyond steady flow calculations in applications of pair smoluchowski theories .",

    "yield surfaces have been empirically postulated and employed for over a century in the engineering community to study the yielding of amorphous solids ( see also subsection [ yieldstress ] ) .",
    "the two classical criteria for determining the onset of plastic yield are due to tresca @xcite and von mises @xcite .",
    "the tresca criterion asserts that a material will yield when the maximum shear stress due to the deformation exceeds a critical value . recalling that an external force imposed on a material can be represented",
    "as a stress tensor which can be diagonalized to obtain values for the three principal stresses @xmath450 and @xmath451 , the tresca criterion can be compactly stated in the form @xcite @xmath452 where @xmath453 is the shear stress at yield under a simple shear deformation . according to eq.([tresca_yield ] )",
    "knowledge of @xmath453 is thus sufficient to determine the mechanical stability of a material under an arbitrary applied force .",
    "alternatively , the von mises critierion requires that the distortion strain energy exceeds a critical value at yield @xcite @xmath454 both the tresca and von mises criteria have proven to be in reasonable qualitative agreement with yield experiments on crystalline metals @xcite .",
    "two main assumptions underly eqs.([tresca_yield ] ) and ( [ vonmises_yield ] ) : ( i ) the microscopic rearrangements leading to plastic deformation do not lead to significant dilation of the material , ( ii ) that residual stresses arising from the deformation history of the sample do not influence the yielding ( i.e. there is no bauschinger effect ) .",
    "it is useful to interpret equation ( [ vonmises_yield ] ) geometrically in the space of principal stresses , where it describes a surface separating elastically deformed states from states of plastic flow .",
    "equation ( [ vonmises_yield ] ) defines a circular cylinder with axis along the line @xmath443 and radius @xmath455 .",
    "the symmetry about this ` hydrostatic ' axis is a geometrical reflection of the fact that the yield condition ( [ vonmises_yield ] ) is independent of hydrostatic pressure .",
    "the plane which passes through the origin and which lies perpendicular to the cylinder axis is the so - called deviatoric plane .",
    "all yield stress surfaces which are independent of hydrostatic pressure may be projected without loss of information onto the deviatoric plane . in the case of the von mises and tresca criteria this generates a circle ( see fig.[vm ] ) and a hexagon , respectively .",

    "this stress tensor at yield may be diagonalized to obtain three eigenvalues and plotted as a point in the cartesian space of principal stresses . by considering all possible nondegenerate flows ( made possible by a suitable parameterization of the velocity gradient tensor @xcite ) a closed locus of points",
    "may be constructed in the space : the dynamic yield stress surface . in @xcite",
    "this procedure was realized using the schematic model eqs.([schematic_stress])([hfunc ] ) .    in fig.[vonmises ]",
    "we show the deviatoric projection of the dynamical yield stress surface of a colloidal glass , as predicted by the schematic model . to a first approximation",
    "the numerically calculated dynamical yield surface from the theory agrees well with the empirical von mises criterion for static yield ( [ vonmises_yield ] ) .",
    "however , closer inspection ( see fig.[vonmises ] , right panel ) reveals that deviations at around the percent level occur , with the maximal deviation located at points of pure uniaxial extension .",
    "a careful analysis of the schematic equations reveals that this fine structure of the surface can be attributed to the existence of a finite first normal stress difference @xcite . expanding the schematic model result to first order in @xmath461 , the first normal stress difference at yield , provides an explicit expression for the schematic model yield surface @xcite @xmath462 where @xmath463 parameterizes the geometry of the imposed flow .",
    "eq.([vonmises_yield2 ] ) thus describes a noncircular cylinder with a radius which varies according to the value of the parameter @xmath258 , each value of which corresponds to a given azimuthal angle about the hydrostatic axis .",
    "higher order terms in the expansion ( [ vonmises_yield2 ] ) exist ( and can be explicitly calculated ) but remain numerically negligable due to the smallness of @xmath464 .",
    "very recent experiments on yielding soft materials have attempted to determine the shape of the yield surface @xcite .",
    "the novel rheometer employed in @xcite applies a combined squeeze and rotational shear flow to a material sample loaded between two parallel plates .",
    "the claim is that by independently varying the rotation and squeeze rate it may become possible to explore the entire family of flows in a way analogous to the mathematical parameterization of the velocity gradient tensor employed in @xcite to calculate the schematic model yield surface .",
    "however , it remains uncertain whether the superposition of two shear flows ( radial poiseuille and tangential homogeneous shear ) is really sufficient to map the yield surface .",
    "fig.[ovarlez_fig ] shows experimental data taken using three different yielding materials : a carbopol gel and two different emulsions @xcite .",
    "the yield data are shown in the rotational shear stress ( @xmath465 ) , squeeze shear stress ( @xmath456 ) plane . while the data shown in fig.[ovarlez_fig ] are not inconsistent with the von mises criteria , it may well be that the chosen superposition flow actually constrains the surface to be spherical , regardless of the true form of the yield surface",
    ". it would certainly be remarkable if the soft materials considered in @xcite obey yield criteria developed for crystalline solids , despite the very different underlying microscopic plasticity mechanisms @xcite .    whether the microscopic theory ( eqs.([equom])([vertex ] ) ) indeed predicts",
    "a similar dynamic yield surface , as expected , and its relationship to static yielding in glassy materials remain important open problems .",
    "nevertheless , the results from the schematic model are promising and represent a considerable step towards a microscopic derivation of material specific yield surfaces from first principles .",
    "in this review we have attempted to provide an overview of the rheological phenomenology presented by colloidal dispersions and to outline some of the leading theoretical approaches aiming to rationalize this .",
    "it is clear that much remains to be done and that exisiting theories have met with only partial success in solving the complex many - body problem of driven , strongly interacting colloidal systems .",
    "we hope that both the presentation and choice of topics contained within the present work serve to emphasize the common ground between different theories ( continuum mechanics , pair smoluchowski treatments and green - kubo based approaches ) , as well as to highlight where progress still needs to be made .",
    "one of the clear deficiencies of approximate closures of the pair smoluchowski equation is their apparent inability to describe , even qualitatively , the slow structural relaxation time present in colloidal dispersions at finite volume fraction .",
    "this failing is inherent in the markovian character of the approximate closures , which follows as a natural consequence of applying equilibrium statisitical mechanical relations to connect pair and triplet correlation functions .",
    "a clear challenge to future theories which attempt to improve this situation is thus to tackle directly the intinsic difference between nonequlibrium and equlibrium by confronting the irreducible term ( see eq.[fict_trip ] ) containing the missing physics .",
    "moreover , the existing numerical data in the literature is restricted , largely for technical reasons , to the low @xmath88 limit . while this enables interesting analysis of the zero - shear viscosity and leading order microstructural distortion ,",
    "there is an absence of data for the nonlinear rheology as a function of @xmath88 .    despite the success of the itt - mct approach in describing the nonlinear response of states close to dynamic arrest",
    ", there remain gaps in the theoretical formulation which should be filled and many fundamental questions are yet to be addressed .",
    "a notable omission is that the present formulation of the theory does not enable incorporation of hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "the influence of hydrodynamics on the rheology of densely packed glassy states is largely unexplored and their incorporation into the theory , even at a crude approximate level , would therefore be of considerable interest .",
    "moreover , due to the recent nature of the itt - mct theory and the complexity of numerically solving the equations , many flows of rheological interest remain to be explored in detail .",
    "of particular importance is to assess the predictions of the theory for nonsteady flows where interesting interaction effects between yielding and the time - dependent strain field may be envisaged ( e.g. large amplitude oscillatory shear , where higher harmonics will contribute to the stress response ) .",

    "voigtmann and m.  krger for many stimulating discussions .",

    "the data confirmed the factorization properties of the @xmath466 and @xmath467 relaxation , as predicted by the mode - coupling theory of the glass transition @xcite . in @xcite confocal microscopy experiments on a mixture of pmma colloids and non - adsorbing polymer were used to confirm the capillary wave theory of the fluctuating interface between demixed fluid phases @xcite .",

    "in addition , we refer the reader to physica a * 118 * 43 ( 1983 ) , which documents the insightful comments of p.g .  de gennes regarding this issue .",
    "interestingly , the force acting on an isolated hard - sphere of radius @xmath75 in a newtonian solvent under ( stokesian ) shear flow is identical to that acting on a point particle ( @xmath468 ) moving with the affine flow ; i.e. the fact that the solvent flows around the particle does not influence the resulting force .",
    "however , setting @xmath469 is an approximation for finite colloidal volume fraction .    in @xcite a confocal microscopy study of polymethylmethacrylate ( pmma ) colloids suspended in a mixture of decalin and tetralin revealed inhomogeneous plug flow for glassy states .",
    "in contrast , the rheological experiments performed in @xcite and @xcite using thermosensitive pnipam core - shell particles are fully consistent with homogeneous flow , both above and below the glass transition .                  in order to observe glassy behaviour",
    "the timescale of crystal nucleation @xmath470 has to be extended beyond the accessible experimental or simulation measurement time .",
    "fortunately , @xmath470 is a sensitive function of the degree of polydispersity and for hard - sphere - like systems a polydispersity @xmath471% is usually sufficient to effectively supress crystallization .                                                              in general ,",
    "the initial value of the shear modulus is determined by near - field hydrodynamic lubrication forces .",
    "the commonly studied case of brownian hard - spheres in the absence of hydrodynamic interactions is a pathological special case for which @xmath472 as a consequence of the discontinuous potential interaction .",
    "nevertheless , the brownian hard - sphere @xmath125 rapidly becomes physical for later times .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for more details on this issue .",
    "we note that there exist numerous alternative definitions of the ` yield stress ' in the literature .",
    "two common choices are : ( i ) the maximum value of the stress overshoot which occurs in response to the onset of steady shear flow , ( ii ) the point for which @xmath473 as a function of amplitude for fixed frequency in oscillatory experiments ( strain sweeps ) .    this expecation is supported by the simulations performed in @xcite which found that the maximum of the stress - strain curve during start - up shear flow , often identified as the static yield - stress , exhibits a logarithmic dependence on the age of the system .",
