    "synchronization phenomena in phase oscillator networks are usally addressed by considering the paradagmatic kuramoto model  @xcite .",
    "this model has been applied in many contexts ranging from crowd synchrony  @xcite to synchronization , learning and multistability in neuronal systems  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the model has been considered with different topologies ranging from homogeneous fully coupled networks to scale - free inhomogeneous systems  @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been employed as a prototypical example to analyze low dimensional behaviour in a single large population of phase oscillators with a global sinusoidal coupling  @xcite , as well as in many hierarchically coupled sub - populations  @xcite .",
    "the study of the kuramoto model for non - locally coupled arrays  @xcite and for two populations of symmetrically globally coupled oscillators  @xcite lead to the discover of the so - called chimera states , whose existence has been revealed also experimentally in the very last years  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will examine the dynamics and synchronization properties of a generalized kuramoto model for phase oscillators with an inertial term both for fully coupled and for diluted systems .",
    "the modification of the kuramoto model with an additional inertial term was firstly reported in  @xcite by tanaka , lichtenberg and oishi ( tlo ) .",
    "these authors have been inspired in their modelization by a previous phase model developed by ermentrout to mimic the synchronization mechanisms observed among the fireflies _ pteroptix malaccae _",
    "these fireflies synchronize their flashing activity by entraining to the forcing frequency with almost zero phase lag , even for stimulating frequencies different from their own intrinsic flashing frequency .",
    "the main ingredient to allow for the adaptation of the flashing frequency to the forcing one is to include an inertial term in a standard phase model for synchronization .",
    "furthermore , networks of phase coupled oscillators with inertia have been recently employed to investigate the self - synchronization in power grids  @xcite , as well as in disordered arrays of underdamped josephson junctions  @xcite .",
    "explosive synchronization have been reported for a complex system made of phase oscillators with inertia , where the natural frequency of each oscillator is assumed to be proportional to the degree of its node  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the authors have shown that the tlo mean field approach reproduces very well the numerical results for their system .",
    "our aim is to describe from a dynamical point of view the hysteretic transition observed in the tlo model for finite size systems and for various values of the inertia ; we will devote a particular emphasis to the description and characterization of coexisting clusters . furthermore , the analysis is extended to random networks for different level of dilution and to a realistic case , represented by the high - voltage power grid in italy .",
    "in particular , in sect . [ sec2 ] we will introduce the model and we will describe our simulation protocols as well as the order parameter employed to characterize the level of coherence in the system . the mean field theory developed by tlo is presented in sect .",
    "[ sec3 ] together with a generalization able to capture the emergence of clusters of locked oscillators of any size induced by the presence of the inertial term .",
    "the theoretical mean field results are compared with finite size simulations of fully coupled systems in sect .",
    "[ sec4 ] ; in the same section the stability limits of the coherent and incoherent phase are numerically investigated for various simulation protocols as a function of the mass value and of the system size .",
    "a last subsection is devoted to the emergence of clusters of drifting oscillators and to their influence on the collective level of coherence .",

    "this equation admits for sufficiently small forcing frequency @xmath2 two fixed points : a stable node and a saddle . at larger frequencies @xmath67",
    "a homoclinic bifurcation leads to the emergence of a limit cycle from the saddle . the stable limit cycle and the stable fixed point coexist until a saddle node bifurcation , taking place at @xmath68 , leads to the disappearence of the fixed points and for @xmath69 only the oscillating solution is presents .",
    "this scenario is correct for sufficiently large masses , at small @xmath70 one have a direct transition from a stable node to a periodic oscillating orbit at @xmath68  @xcite .",
    "therefore for sufficiently large @xmath70 there is a coexistence regime where , depending on the initial conditions , the single oscillator can rotate or stay quiet .",
    "how this single unit property will reflect in the self - consistent collective dynamics of the coupled systems is the topic of this paper .",
    "tanaka , lichtenberg , and oishi in their seminal papers @xcite have examined the origin of the first order hysteretic transition observed for lorentzian and flat ( bounded ) frequency distributions @xmath71 by considering two different initial states for the network : ( i ) the completely desynchronized state ( @xmath72 ) and ( ii ) the fully synchronized one ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "furthermore , in case i ( ii ) they studied how the level of synchronization , measured by @xmath19 , varies due to the increase ( decrease ) of the coupling @xmath4 . in the first case the oscillators are all initially drifting with finite velocities @xmath73 ; by increasing @xmath4 the oscillators with smaller natural frequencies @xmath74 begin to lock ( @xmath75 ) , while the other continue to drift .",

    "this happens , by decreasing @xmath4 , whenever @xmath78 .",
    "this is numerically verified , indeed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ omegadis ] , the maximal locked frequency @xmath22 remains constant until , by decreasing @xmath4 , it encounters the curve @xmath79 and then @xmath22 follows this latter curve down to the desynchronized state . the case ( ii )",
    "corresponds to the situation observable for the usual kuramoto model , where there is no bistability  @xcite .    in both the examined cases",
    "there is a group of desynchronized oscillators and one of locked oscillators separated by a frequency , @xmath76 in the first case and @xmath79 in the second one .",
    "these groups contribute differently to the total level of synchronization of the system , namely @xmath80 where @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) is the contribution of the locked ( drifting ) population .    for the locked population , one gets @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the drifting oscillators contribute to the total order parameter with a negative contribution ; the self - consistent integral defining @xmath82 has been estimated by tlo in a perturbative manner by performing an expansion up to the fourth order in @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "therefore the obtained expression is correct in the limit of sufficiently large masses and it reads as @xmath88 where @xmath89 .    by considering an initially desynchronized ( fully synchronized ) system and by increasing ( decreasing ) @xmath4 one can get a theoretical approximation for the level of synchronization in the system by employing the mean - field expression ( [ rl ] ) , ( [ rd ] ) and ( [ rrr ] ) for case i ( ii ) . in this way ,",
    "two curves are obtained in the phase plane @xmath90 , namely @xmath91 and @xmath92 . in the following",
    ", we will show that these are not the unique admissible solutions in the mentioned plane , and these curves represent the lower and upper bound for the possible states characterized by a partial level of synchronization .",
    "let us notice that the expression for @xmath81 and @xmath82 reported in eqs .",
    "( [ rl ] ) and ( [ rd ] ) are the same for case ( i ) and ( ii ) , only the integration extrema have been changed .",
    "these are defined by the frequency which discriminates locked from drifting neuron , that in case ( i ) is @xmath76 and in case ( ii ) @xmath79 .",
    "the value of these frequencies is a function of the order parameter @xmath19 and of the coupling constant @xmath4 , therefore by increasing ( decreasing ) @xmath4 they change accordingly .",

    "we will compare our numerical results for various system sizes with the mean - field result ( [ k1c ] ) .",
    "complete synchronization can be achieved , in the ideal case of infinite oscillators with a distribution @xmath71 with infinite support , only in the limit of infinite coupling . however , in finite systems an ( almost ) complete synchronization is attainable already at finite coupling , to give an estimation of this effective coupling @xmath112 one can proceed as follows .",

    "the transition appears to become continuous only when the number of links per node becomes of the order of few units . by increasing the system size the transition to the continuous case ( if any ) shifts to smaller and smaller values of the connectivity .    in this paper we focused on gaussian distribution of the natural frequencies , however we have obtained similar results also for lorentzian distributions .",
    "it would be however interesting to examine how the transition modifies in presence of non - unimodal distributions for the natural frequencies , like bimodal ones .",
    "preliminary indications in this direction can be obtained by the reported analysis of the self - synchronization process occurring in the italian high - voltage power grid , when the generators and consumers are mimicked in terms of a kuramoto model with inertia  @xcite . in this case",
    "the transition is largely non hysteretic , probably this is due to the low value of the average connectivity in such a network .",

    "these states are characterized by quasi - periodic oscillations in the order parameter due to the coexistence of several clusters of drifting oscillators",
