    "liouville s rigidity of spatial conformal geometry shows that conformal mappings in domains in @xmath8 are restrictions of mbius transformations .",
    "however this rigidity no longer persists in quasiconformal geometry intensively studied since 1930s after its introduction by h.grzsch @xcite and m.a.lavrentiev @xcite .",
    "first assertions reflecting spatial specifics in this quasiconformal geometry were made by m.a.lavrentiev @xcite , on removability of some singularities of quasiconformal mappings and on locally homeomorphic mappings in @xmath9 .",
    "v.a.zorichs 1967 solution @xcite of the last lavrentiev s problem shows that locally homeomorphic quasiregular mappings of @xmath10 into itself are homeomorphisms of @xmath11 , and thus quasiconformal mappings .",
    "in addition to his proof of lavrentiev s problem zorich gave an example of a quasiregular mapping @xmath12 omitting the origin and having an essential singularity at infinity . this so - called zorich map is a spatial analogue of the exponential function in @xmath13 and is based on p.p.belinskiis construction of a quasiconformal mapping of a half space @xmath14 onto a round solid cylinder . due to the previous zorich theorem ,",
    "the branching of the map ( along parallel lines orthogonally intersecting the boundary plane at integer points ) can not be avoided . in a general sense",
    "all quasiregular mappings topologically have a branched covering type .",
    "namely by reshetnyak s theorem , quasiregular mappings are ( generalized ) branched covers , that is , discrete and open mappings and hence local homeomorphisms modulo an exceptional set of ( topological ) codimension at least two .",
    "their intensive study , especially after the mentioned zorich results and conjectures in @xcite , resulted in a rich theory of quasiregular mappings which is a natural and beautiful generalization of the geometric aspects of the theory of holomorphic functions in the plane to higher dimensions .",
    "it is covered by several papers and a number of monographs - see @xcite-@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and most recently by a fundamental paper on sharpness of rickman s picard theorem in all dimensions @xcite .    here",
    "we address two sides of the mentioned lavrentiev - zorich assertions : on locally homeomorphic spatial quasiregular mappings defined in the ( almost ) whole sphere @xmath1 and their essential singularities .",
    "despite a relative rigidity of quasiregular mappings without branching , in theorem [ map ] we present a new ( flexible ) way for constructions of such locally homeomorphic quasiregular mappings @xmath15 defined in the whole sphere @xmath1 except a dense cantor subset in @xmath16 ( or in a quasi - sphere @xmath17 in @xmath1 ) . moreover",
    "this exceptional dense cantor subset in a quasi - sphere @xmath18 creates a barrier for our quasiregular mapping ( of a topological nature ) since it consists of essential singularities of our mapping allowing no continuous extension of it to any neighbourhood of an arbitrary point @xmath19 .",
    "the construction of such quasiregular mappings in @xmath1 having @xmath16 as their barrier is based on our construction of non - trivial compact 4-dimensional cobordisms @xmath20 with symmetric boundary components .",
    "the interiors of these 4-cobordisms have complete 4-dimensional real hyperbolic structures and universally covered by the real hyperbolic space @xmath21 , while the boundary components of @xmath20 have ( symmetric ) 3-dimensional conformally flat structures obtained by deformations of the same hyperbolic 3-manifold whose fundamental group @xmath22 is a uniform lattice in @xmath23 .",
    "such conformal deformations of hyperbolic manifolds are well understood after their discovery in @xcite , see @xcite .",
    "nevertheless till recently such `` symmetric '' hyperbolic 4-cobordisms with described properties were unknown despite our well known constructions of non - trivial hyperbolic homology 4-cobordisms with very assymmetric boundary components - see @xcite and @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in @xcite we presented a method of constructing such non - trivial `` symmmetric '' hyperbolic 4-cobordisms @xmath24 whose fundamental groups @xmath25 act discretely in the hyperbolic 4-space @xmath21 by isometries , @xmath26 , and can be obtained from the hyperbolic 3-lattice @xmath2 by a homomorphism @xmath27 with non - trivial kernel ( in our construction such kernel of @xmath28 is a free subgroup @xmath29 on three generators ) . in section 2",
    "we present all necessary details of our cunstruction of such `` symmetric '' hyperbolic 4-cobordisms and used discrete groups ( theorem [ constr ] and proposition [ homo ] ) . by using such `` symmetric '' hyperbolic 4-cobordisms our locally homeomorphic quasiregular mappings",

    "this finishes our definition of the family of twelve round spheres whose interiors cover the square ring @xmath124 on the top side of one of the two unit cubes in our cube chain and tells us which two spheres among the four new defined spheres @xmath119 were already included in the collection @xmath82 of reflecting spheres ( as the spheres @xmath113 associated to small cubes in the first step ) .",

    "so the discontinuity set @xmath137 of @xmath4 consists of two invariant connected components @xmath71 and @xmath72 :    @xmath138    [ h - body ] the splitting of the discontinuity set @xmath139 of our discrete reflection group @xmath133 into @xmath4-invariant components @xmath71 and @xmath72 in [ comp ] defines a heegaard splitting of the 3-sphere @xmath1 of infinite genus with ergodic word hyperbolic group @xmath4 action on the separating boundary @xmath140 which is quasi - self - similar in the sense of sullivan .    in fact , despite the contractibility of polyhedra @xmath45 and @xmath46 both components @xmath71 and @xmath72 are not simply connected and even are mutually linked . to show this it is enough to see that the union of the bounded polyhedron @xmath141 ( inside of our block chain ) and its image @xmath142 under the reflection @xmath143 with respect to the plane @xmath90 has a non - contractible loop @xmath144 which represents a non - trivial element of the fundamental group @xmath145 .",
    "this loop is linked with the loop @xmath146 in the unbounded component @xmath72 which goes around @xmath147 and represents a non - trivial element of the fundamental group @xmath148 .",

    "their fundamental groups @xmath145 and @xmath148 have infinitely many generators , and some of those generators correspond to the group @xmath4-images of the linked loops @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "the limit set @xmath140 is the common boundary of @xmath71 and @xmath72 . since the group @xmath153 acts on the hyperbolic 4-space @xmath21 , @xmath154 , as a convex cocompact isometry group , its action on the limit set @xmath140 is ergodic .",
    "moreover , the common boundary @xmath140 of the handlebodies @xmath42 and @xmath43 is quasi - self - similar in the sense of d.sullivan , that is each arbitrary small piece of @xmath140 can be expanded to a standard size and then mapped into @xmath140 by a @xmath155-quasi - isometry . more precisely , there are uniform constants @xmath155 and @xmath156 such that , for any @xmath157 and for any ball @xmath158 centered at @xmath159 with radius @xmath160 , @xmath161 , there exists a @xmath155-quasi - isometric bijection @xmath108 , @xmath162 which distorts distances in the interval between @xmath163 and @xmath155 .",
    "in other words , the distortion of an unlimited _  microscoping \" _ ( [ qi ] ) of the limit set @xmath140 can be uniformly bounded , see corollary 2.66 in apanasov @xcite .",
    "to finish the proof of theorem [ constr ] we notice that the combinatorial type ( with magnitudes of dihedral angles ) of the bounded component @xmath45 of the fundamental polyhedron @xmath73 coincides with the combinatorial type of its unbounded component @xmath46 . applying andreev s theorem on 3-dimensional hyperbolic polyhedra @xcite , one can see that there exists a compact hyperbolic polyhedron @xmath75 of the same combinatorial type with the same dihedral angles ( @xmath131 or @xmath131 ) .",
    "so one can consider a uniform hyperbolic lattice @xmath76 generated by reflections in sides of the hyperbolic polyhedron @xmath47 .",

    "it is also clear that @xmath206 is @xmath207 , the normal closure of elements @xmath175 and @xmath180 .",
    "therefore in order to prove that @xmath208 it is enough to show that @xmath209 contains all elements which are conjugate in @xmath197 to @xmath159 and @xmath185 .    as any element @xmath210 is a product of generators of @xmath197 , the conjugation by any such @xmath211 may be regarded as a consequent conjugation by the generators of @xmath212 .",

    "in fact it is easy to verify that    @xmath215    now we should show that the elements @xmath216 and @xmath184 form a free basis for @xmath209 .",
