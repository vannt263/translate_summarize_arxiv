    "the @xmath1 expansion was introduced by t  hooft for the study of @xmath2 color theories of the strong interaction  @xcite .",
    "t  hooft showed that the leading contribution to each order in the now - called t  hooft parameter @xmath3 comes from planar diagrams , where @xmath4 is the gauge coupling and @xmath5 is kept fixed as @xmath6 .",
    "since then , the @xmath1 expansion has been used in many different settings , and it has been realized the role played by the two parameters @xmath0 and @xmath5 not just at the perturbative level , but to describe fluctuations around saddle points and more general non - perturbative phenomena .",
    "the analysis of these non - perturbative phenomena requires methods beyond classical asymptotics , and leads to new results in matrix models , gauge theories , supersymmetric gauge theories and string theories  @xcite .",
    "non - perturbative effects in matrix models were first studied by david  @xcite in the critical case and using the double - scaling limit method , but it was soon realized that these effects are also worth studying in matrix models off criticality . among the key realizations were ( i ) that the set of saddle points of a matrix model allows us to describe the nonperturbative corrections to the free energy in terms of large-@xmath0 instantons , i.e. , migration of eigenvalues among different pieces of the eigenvalue density support , and ( ii ) the role played by complex saddles even in cases where the original partition functions were sums over real configurations  @xcite .    in a recent paper buividovich , dunne , and valgushev",
    "@xcite applied these ideas to a detailed numerical study of the complex saddle points in the gross - witten - wadia ( gww ) unitary matrix model , which is equivalent to a simple 2d lattice gauge theory  @xcite .",
    "their numerical calculations go beyond the well - known results on the vacuum configuration ( both in the weak- and strong - coupling phases ) to discover new configurations of complex saddle points which can be interpreted as non - perturbative effects .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to provide an exhaustive classification of these configurations in the large-@xmath0 limit , as well as to give independent analytic derivations of the corresponding weak - coupling and strong - coupling instanton actions that do not rely on a trans - series ansatz in the string equation  @xcite .    in 2005",
    "mizoguchi  @xcite used a change of variables to transform the partition function of the unitary gww matrix model into the partition function of an hermitian matrix model defined on the real line .    our strategy it to use directly the matrix eigenvalues as integration variables , thus keeping the simpler form of the potential and in effect allowing us to write and solve a system of equations similar to those used in refs .",

    "this classification is presented graphically in two forms : the first results from the direct application of the method ; the second , that has to be derived from the first , is simpler , physically more meaningful , and permits direct comparison with the numerical results of ref .",
