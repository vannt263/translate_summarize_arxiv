    "in  @xcite we argued that a good deal of basic category theory can be carried out in any strong  balanced factorization category \" ( bfc ) . recall that a finitely complete category @xmath0 is a bfc if it is endowed with two factorization systems @xmath10 and @xmath11 which are reciprocally stable : the pullback of a map in @xmath14 ( resp .",
    "@xmath15 ) along a map in @xmath4 ( resp .",
    "@xmath3 ) is itself in @xmath14 ( resp .",
    "@xmath15 ) .",
    "we say that @xmath0 is a  strong \" bfc if , furthermore , @xmath16 ( the category @xmath17 of  internal sets \" ) .",
    "we refer to  weak \" bfc s when we wish to emphasize that this condition is not required to hold .",
    "the motivating example of a strong bfc is @xmath18 , with the comprehensive factorization systems : @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the classes of discrete fibrations and opfibrations , while @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the classes of final and initial functors , so that @xmath19 ( while @xmath20 are the connected categories ) .    in the first part of the present paper , we review and further develop some aspects of balanced category theory . in particular",
    ", we consider the bifunctors @xmath21 and their restrictions @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the internal set of components of ( the total of ) the product over @xmath24 ( and reduces in @xmath18 to the tensor product of the corresponding set - functors ) .    now , while the bifibrations associated to the factorization systems of the bfc @xmath0 are summarized , in terms of indexed categories , by the adjunctions @xmath25 @xmath26 for any @xmath27 in @xmath0 , and the reflections @xmath28 for any @xmath29 ( and in particular @xmath30 ) , the axiom allows us to obtain also the following  coadjunction \" laws : @xmath31 @xmath32 natural in @xmath33 ( or @xmath34 ) , @xmath35 ( or @xmath36 ) and @xmath37 .    with this toolkit , we are in a position to straghtforwardly prove familiar properties of colimits of  internal - set - valued \" maps @xmath33 or @xmath38 , and also that , for any @xmath9 in @xmath0 , there is a bicartesian arrow @xmath39 of the bimodule @xmath40 , obtained by composing @xmath41 with the points functor @xmath42 .",
    "thus the subcategories @xmath43 of  slices ( projections ) \" @xmath44 in @xmath45 and @xmath46 of  coslices ( projections ) \" @xmath47 in @xmath36 are dual . furthermore , under a  nullstellensatz",
    "\" hypothesis , we prove that the bicartesian arrows of @xmath48 correspond to the retracts of slices in @xmath45 ( or coslices in @xmath36 ) , so offering an alternative perspective on cauchy completion also in the classical case @xmath49 .",
    "it is also shown how these retracts may arise as reflections of figures @xmath50 whose shape @xmath51 is an  atom \" ( such as the monoid with an idempotent non - identity arrow for @xmath49 ) .    in the second part ,",
    "most of which can be read indipendently from the first one , we sketch how some relevant aspects of topology can be developed in a bfc too . while are known to form the second factor of a on the category @xmath52 of topological spaces , we intend to show that , by replacing @xmath52 with a suitable category @xmath2 , it is reasonable to assume that the same is true for and that holds therein .",
    "the existence of a reflection @xmath53 in  sets \" suggests that the spaces @xmath54 are  locally connected \" , and in fact the neighborhoods @xmath55 are connected that is , the map @xmath56 is in @xmath14",
    ". some homotopical properties of spaces can be studied throughfinite coverings \" that is , maps in @xmath57 ; for instance , a space is  simply connected \" if @xmath58 is an equivalence . by the reciprocal stability law",
    ", spaces in @xmath2 are also locally simply connected , so that finite coverings are in fact locally trivial ( corollary  [ p.hom ] ) .",
    "thus we maintain that ( weak ) bfc s form a common kernel shared by category theory and topology , and that both the subjects are enlighted by this point of view .",
    "for example , the law allows us , on the topological side , to extend ( via exponentiation ) the classical complementarity between open and closed parts to and perfect maps in @xmath2 , with evident conceptual advantages ; on the other side , it provides a sort of internal duality for categorical concepts ( as sketched above ) which often turns out to be more effective than an  obvious \" duality functor .",
    "after three preliminary  technical \" sections on bimodules , factorization systems and balanced factorization categories , and after recalling some concepts of balanced category theory , we emphasize in sections  [ int ] , [ ten ] and  [ sli ] the central role of the law in treating  internal aspects \" of ( balanced ) category theory .",
    "namely , we study ( co)limits of internal presheaves in @xmath45 or @xmath36 , and the role of the retracts of the representable ones ( that is , ( co)slice projections ) . in the last three sections we sketch the idea of balanced topology ; in particular , we present some  evidences \" of the fact that the law should hold in an appropriate ",
    "topological \" category @xmath2 , in which and are assumed as the basic concepts .",
    "in this section we collect some basic facts about bimodules that will be used in the sequel ; while most of them are well known , others ( proposition  [ p.bim ] ) are new to our knowledge .",

    "we pass from one representation to the other , depending on the convenience .",
    "a bimodule is ",
    "representable on the right \" if it is a prefibration ( or , equivalently , a fibration ) : for any @xmath64 , @xmath65 is representable : @xmath66",
    ". dually , a bimodule is ",
    "representable on the left \" if it is an op(pre)fibration .",
    "it is a bifibration iff it is birepresentable , that is corresponds ( up to choice ) to an adjunction @xmath67 .    given a bimodule @xmath61 , if @xmath68 is a square in @xmath69 as below , we write @xmath70 .",

    "if both conditions hold , we have a bijection @xmath79 , which in the case of representable bimodules becomes the hom - set bijection of a corresponding adjunction @xmath67 ( note that , in that case , the naturality of the bijection is given simply by composition - juxtaposition of squares ) .    on the other hand , if @xmath80 we write @xmath81 in place of @xmath82 .",
    "so @xmath83 means that @xmath84 and @xmath85 are endomorphisms and @xmath86 ; in particular , for identities , @xmath87 simply means that @xmath88 . for representable bimodules",
    "@xmath89 says that @xmath90 is the image of @xmath13 according to a corresponding functor , with @xmath72 as the universal element",
    ".    we will be here mainly concerned with the ternary relation @xmath91 ( or in particular , for identities - objects , @xmath92 ) , saying that @xmath72 is bicartesian ( or  biuniversal \" ) and @xmath84 and @xmath85 are related ( as above ) by it . in that case , we say that say that @xmath84 and @xmath85 are  conjugate \" by @xmath72 .",
    "often we are interested to existentially quantify this relation over some of the three variables ; for example , we write @xmath93 if @xmath13 and @xmath90 are conjugate by some arrow , or we say that @xmath13 is ( or has a ) conjugate if this holds for some @xmath64 .    [ fixed categories ] [ r.bim ] it is easily seen by the above remarks that , for any bimodule @xmath94 , there is an equivalence between the full subcategories @xmath95 and @xmath96 of conjugate objects in @xmath24 and @xmath97 respectively ; if the bimodule is birepresentable , we get the classical fact that an adjunction restricts to an equivalence among the full subcategories of objects with isomorphic units or counits respectively .",
    "( indeed , the units and counits are conjugate to isomorphisms in @xmath24 or @xmath97 , and the latter are the bicartesian arrows over @xmath98 or @xmath99 . ) similarly , if in the above situation all cartesian arrows are also opcartesian then @xmath100 and so the right adjoint is fully faithful .",

    "; for instance , they generate the cauchy completion of @xmath24 and can be characterized in several ways . in order to develop a similar analysis in @xmath0",
    ", we need to consider the  unenrichment \" mentioned in section  [ lim ] , by taking the points of @xmath397 ; namely we define the bimodules @xmath441 by @xmath442    [ p1.ten ] for any @xmath9 there is a bicartesian arrow @xmath443 for @xmath48 .    recalling the notations of section  [ bim ] , we begin by showing that @xmath444 , that is that @xmath445 is represented by @xmath286 : @xmath446 @xmath447 now , it is easy to see that the cartesian arrow ( universal element ) is given by the component @xmath448 $ ] of the element @xmath449 ( with @xmath450 and @xmath451 ) : @xmath452\\ar@/^1.5pc/[drr]^{e_x}\\ar@/_1.5pc/[ddr]_{e'_x }     \\\\ & x\\bs x\\tm_x x / x \\ar[d]\\ar[r ]    & x / x \\ar[d]^{\\down\\,\\ , x }    \\\\ & x\\bs x   \\ar[r]^{\\up\\,\\ , x }      & x              } \\ ] ] thus , by symmetry , the cartesian arrow is also opcartesian , and the proof is complete .",
    "the full subcategories @xmath453 and @xmath454 , generated by the slices and the coslices projections respectively , are dual .",
    "we are now in a position to prove :    [ p2.ten ] under the nullstellensatz hypothesis , all the ( op)cartesian arrows of @xmath48 are in fact bicartesian , and the conjugate objects in @xmath45 ( @xmath36 ) are the retracts of ( co)slices projections .",
    "so the fixed categories for @xmath48 are the cauchy completions of @xmath453 and @xmath454 .",

    "then , @xmath467 and the cartesianess of @xmath468 implies @xmath469 that is , @xmath139 is a retract of @xmath470 .    by proposition  [ p1.ten ] above , @xmath471 and since @xmath36 is finitely complete , the idempotent @xmath352 , conjugate to @xmath108 , splits as @xmath107 .",
    "thus , by proposition  [ p.bim ] , @xmath139 has a conjugate in @xmath36 and the result follows .      intuitively , an object @xmath472 is an atom if it is so small that any non - void open or closed part over it is the whole @xmath51 , and yet so big that the whole @xmath51 is itself non - void ( see also  @xcite and  @xcite )",

    "in fact , the two conditions are equivalent because , for this particular case , the results of proposition  [ p2.ten ] can be summarized in the following corollary - definition :    under the nullstellensatz hypothesis , the following are equivelent for an object @xmath51 of @xmath0 :    1 .",

    "( note that atoms in @xmath18 are connected since @xmath493 so that the corresponding @xmath427 is fully faithful . )",
    "the most relevant instance of a ( non point - like ) atom in @xmath18 is the monoid @xmath494 with an unique idempotent non - identity arrow @xmath157 .",
    "indeed , the points - sections - limit functor and the components - colimit functor @xmath495 are isomorphic ( to the fixed points of the endomapping associated to @xmath157 ) .    of course , in presence of internal limits @xmath413 , as discussed in section  [ lim ] , one may define  internal atoms \" that is , objects @xmath472 such that @xmath496 , naturally in @xmath474 or @xmath497 .",

    "another property which characterizes conjugate presheaves in @xmath18 is the cocontinuity of the functor @xmath504 represented by it : @xmath505 which gives , for @xmath506 , the elements of @xmath507 fixed by @xmath508 . for a general bfc @xmath0",

    "we hope to have shown that the adjunction and coadjunction laws associated to a strong are a powerful tool to synthetically treat some basic aspects of category theory .",
    "in this  categorical logic of categories \" , a straightforward common generalization of the  meets \" predicate and of the ( internal ) colimit functor , namely the tensor functor , is related to the hom functor ( generalizing the  belongs to \" predicate and the sections or limit functor ) by a useful sort of duality , which is disciplined by the law .",
    "further suggestions can be drawn by comparing it with the weaker logic associated to ",
    "topological \" weak bfc s , which is briefly illustrated in the sequel .",
    "it is commonly acknowledged that the main reason of the effectiveness of category theory is its role as a language apt to define and elaborate the universal properties which pervade mathematics .",
