    "detailed studies of void galaxies allow one to determine the effect of the environment on the evolution of galaxies .",
    "the isolation and ( assumed ) low rate of interactions and mergers make void galaxies a useful population for testing models of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the possibility that galaxies in voids have significantly different properties than galaxies in denser regions has attracted considerable attention ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* and references therein ) .",
    "however , most previous studies have been focused on large distant ( @xmath7 100 - 200  mpc ) voids ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among others ) , drawn from the sdss and 2dfrgs surveys , and consequently are biased towards more luminous galaxies .",
    "these studies generally found at best moderate differences between galaxies in voids and walls . numerical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) predict that luminous dwarfs ( m@xmath8 @xmath9 ) in voids are statistically indistinguishable from similar dwarfs in higher density regions .",
    "however , fainter dwarfs ( m@xmath8 @xmath10 ) are expected to be significantly bluer and have to have higher specific star formation rates than their higher density counterparts .",
    "since , as mentioned above , previous studies have included very few of these faint systems , there is a clear need to extend the observational samples to include low - mass galaxies .    in order to study the effect of the environment on the properties of faint dwarfs",
    ", one would have to focus on nearby regions , where current facilities have sufficient sensitivity to detect faint dwarfs . in the surroundings of the local volume ( i.e. the region within 10  mpc from the local group ) one can probe the properties of galaxies ten to hundred times less luminous than the galaxies studied in the distant voids .",
    "motivated by this consideration @xcite drew up a sample of galaxies in the nearby lynx - cancer void .",
    "the gas phase metallicity and photometrical properties of the void galaxy population have been presented in @xcite .",
    "detailed studies of some peculiar galaxies located in this region can be found in @xcite .",

    "other galaxies found in nearby voids include lsbds j0015 + 0104 @xcite and j0926 + 3343 @xcite which have the 2@xmath12 and 3@xmath13 lowest metallicities known ( after sbs  0335052  w ) .    in this paper we present a detailed study of the lynx - cancer void galaxy ugc  4722 .",

    "the catalog was built by total visual inspection of the palomar sky survey films for galaxies brighter than 15.7 mag .",
    "@xcite proposed the simple but effective criterion of isolation using only the angular diameters of galaxies .",
    "the isolation criteria requires the absence of ` significant ' neighbours around the considered galaxy .",
    "we have also checked the sdss image the region of @xmath14 ( roughly @xmath15 kpc in projection ) surrounding the galaxy , but do not find any object that could be a possible companion to this system .",
    "finally , ugc  4722 is one of 520 galaxies identified as being the most isolated , ` orphan ' galaxies found in the local supercluster @xcite among galaxies with known redshift . despite being isolated ugc",
    "4722 appears morphologically disturbed and has a long tail extending from the northern side of the disk ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : image ] ) . @xcite listed it as one of 21 ` orphan ' galaxies with a peculiar structure .",
    "ugc  4722 shows clear signs of interaction , but without a visible source for the disturbance .",
    "@xcite found 8 such spatially isolated galaxies with signs of distortion , and based on the suggestions for the existence of `` dark galaxies '' by @xcite and @xcite , proposed that these could be cases where a galaxy is interacting with a companion consisting entirely of dark matter .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows . in sec .  2 we describe the observations of this galaxy and the data reduction .",
    "they include hi21-cm line observations with the gmrt ( giant meterwave radio telescope ) and long - slit spectra obtained using the 6-meter telescope ( bta ) of the special astrophysical observatory of the russian academy of sciences ( sao ras ) .",

    "the integrated @xmath80 colours , ( after accounting for the galaxy foreground extinction @xcite ) are as follows : = 1.03@xmath290.03 , = 0.08@xmath290.01 , = 0.07@xmath290.02 .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ugr ] , these colours are an excellent match to the @xcite evolutionary model tracks for instantaneous sf ( or simple stellar population , ssp ) for both salpeter ( 1955 ) and kroupa et al .",
    "( 1993 ) initial mass functions ( imf ) and metallicity @xmath81=0.002 ( roughly @xmath82@xmath79/10 ) .",
    "the latter @xmath83 is close to the metallicity found in the central hii - region of the nebulosity ` c ' .",
    "the tracks for both types of imf run very close to each other at this time range ( around 0.5  gyr ) .",
    "our best fit estimate of the time since the starburst corresponds to @xmath10.45 - 0.5  gyr with a salpeter imf .",
    "observational studies show that the peak in star formation activity in companion galaxies occurs near the pericenter passage ( e.g. @xcite .",
    "numerical models ( e.g. , galmer , @xcite ) also make similar predictions , albeit for specific initial conditions .",
    "our estimated star burst time hence corresponds approximately to the time since the last close encounter between the two galaxies .",
    "this in turn allows us to estimate the relative velocity of the companion in the sky plane . dividing the projected distance between the centres of ugc  4722 and the nebulosity ` c ' ( i.e. @xmath113.8  kpc ) by the time since perigalactic passage ( i.e. @xmath1500  myr ) , one obtaines @xmath8428  km  s@xmath22",
    "this is about 0.6 of the difference in radial velocities between the two components .    from the pegase2 models one can derive many parameters related to the stellar population including the temporal dependence of the specific luminosity ( per solar mass ) in several passbands . adopting these parameters at an epoch of t=500  myr , as well as the solar absolute magnitude of @xmath85=3.78 and the colour index @xmath86=0.11 , we get @xmath87=3.67 . for the estimated plume absolute magnitude @xmath88= 15.38 ,",
    "one then derives a total stellar mass of 4.6@xmath1710@xmath89  @xmath3@xmath79 .",
    "this can be compared to the total hi - mass ( @xmath3(hi)= 78@xmath1710@xmath90@xmath79 ) or a total gas mass ( @xmath3(hi+he)=1.33@xmath17@xmath3(hi ) ) , @xmath91@xmath79 .",
    "that is the plume s",
    "visible stellar mass comprises only @xmath14% of its baryonic mass .",
    "we obtained two o / h measurements in this system : one in the central hii - region of the nebulosity ` c ' and the second - in the bright hii - region on the edge of the ugc  4722 disk ( region ` f ' ) . both the measured values are rather similar , with the formal difference ( @xmath10.08 dex ) being comparable to the uncertainties ( @xmath10.07 and 0.12 dex ) .",
    "we note that differences in o / h of as large as @xmath10.2530  dex ( i.e. up to factor of two ) would be consistent with our error bars .",
    "significantly higher s / n - ratio spectra of these hii  regions would be needed to rule out this possibility .",
    "we also checked whether these measured metallicities are consistent with the luminosity - metallicity ( `` l - z '' ) relation derived for galaxies residing in denser environments .",
    "in particular , we compare their metallicities with that expected from the relation derived for the local volume dwarfs with well - known distances and o / h by @xcite .",
    "the scatter in this relation is quite small , @xmath92=0.15  dex .",
    "the comparison shows that the measured o / h in our two dwarfs are lower than what would be expected from the l - z relation by a factor of @xmath13 for the main galaxy ugc  4722 and a factor of @xmath12 for the smaller companion ugc  4722c .",
    "the deviation is significantly larger than the measurement errors . while this deviation may partly result from gas infall from the ` unevolved ' outer parts of the galaxies due to the strong tidal disturbance ( as suggested by",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we also note that galaxies in the lynx - cancer void in general have a lower value ( by @xmath1 3050% ) of o / h , @xcite than galaxies residing in denser regions .",
    "the suggestion in @xcite that the ugc4722 system represents the interaction between a dwarf galaxy and a `` dark '' galaxy now appears unlikely , since the baryonic mass in the plume ( @xmath93m@xmath94 ) is larger than the mass of the ` dark ' halos expected in the lcdm models . instead , a plausible scenario for the ugc4722c system is that it is the result of a minor merger between ugc4722 and an extremely gas rich companion which has come in on a parabolic orbit .",
    "had the companion been on a bound orbit , one would have expected that the extended tidal interaction could have led either to a disruption of the galaxy or that tidally induced star formation would have led to a larger stellar mass fraction .",
    "after the closest approach of the parabolic orbit @xmath10.5 gyr ago , some of the gas ( @xmath14% ) collapsed and transformed to stars while a significant fraction of the gas was also pulled out to form the `` plume '' . in this scenario",
    "it is interesting to try and determine what the properties of the smaller companion galaxy were before the start of the collision . from the currently available optical data , it is difficult to estimate the mass of the stellar population of the companion with ages older than 1  gyr .",
    "if there were to be such a population , one would expect that it could also be pulled out in the plume but would remain undetectable because of its very low surface brightness .",
    "it seems reasonable to assume however that any such population would have a stellar mass similar to that of the stellar mass of the ` old ' stellar population related to ugc  4722c , which is @xmath17 times less luminous than the plume .",
    "this implies that before the collision the companion was an extremely gas - rich dwarf . in the most extreme case ,",
    "when the most of its stars formed in the course of the current collision , the pre - collision stellar mass fraction could be as low as 1% or smaller . while this is indeed unusual , it would not be a unique case , as several similar very gas - rich dwarfs have already found in this void @xcite .",
    "in fact the lynx - cancer void hosts two even more extreme gas - rich dwarfs @xcite . an alternative model to the minor merger",
    "is that the ugc4722 represents a very clumpy gas disk . while the disks of somewhat brighter gas rich galaxies are known to be somewhat clumpy ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) ) , cases as disturbed looking as ugc4722 are rare .",
    "additionally , the kinematics of the ugc4722 system are clearly discrepant from what one would expect from a clumpy disk .    the only similar morphology galaxy which we found in the literature is ddo  169 ( ugc  8331 ) .",
    "this is a nearby dwarf irregular galaxy ( @xmath9513.8 , @xmath96=4.4  mpc ) , which has been used in many statistical studies .",
    "the only detailed paper dedicated to this galaxy by @xcite is based on rather shallow hi  vla observations ( 10 and 20 minutes of integration in c and d configurations ) and h@xmath21 imaging .",
    "the earlier hi - maps obtained with westerbork radio telescope also provide only limited sensitivity .",
    "@xcite did not measure the colours of the plume , or those of the brighter knots on the plume edge , and detected h@xmath21 emission only near the bright central body of the galaxy . in the vla maps one can see that there is a hi - peak that coincides with an optical knot at the end of the plume .",
    "ugc  8331 and ugc  4722 hence appear fairly similar , but a more detailed study of ugc  8331 will be needed to establish this in detail .",
    "there are also two other objects with tidal tails / plumes that resemble the ugc  4722 system .",
    "one of the best known is the tadpole galaxy ( ugc  10214=vv  29 ) , studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "several very lsb plumes near large disc galaxies are found by @xcite via deep analysis of the sdss images .",
    "some of them can be analogs of ugc  4722 case .",
    "although the number of such objects known appears limited , we note that the ugc  4722 system has many simiarlities with other small dwarf aggregates found in voids . like ugc  4722 , many void pair and triplet members , show elevated values of @xmath3(hi)/@xmath11 ( @xmath12 to 25 ) , blue colours of their outer regions and low o / h .",
    "examples include : the merger remnant / triplet ddo  68 @xcite , the triplet j0723 + 36 @xcite , the pair hs  0822 + 3542/sao  0822 + 3545 @xcite , pair j0852 + 13 and the triplet mrk  407 ( chengalur et al . , in prep . ) . a more detailed comparison of these unusual systems in voids is postponed to the separate paper .",
    "we also note that there are very few detailed numerical simulations of the merger of extremely gas rich small systems .",
    "such studies would be an important theoretical counterpart to the observations of ugc  4722 and the other systems discussed above .",
    "understanding the merger of small gas rich objects is also important to a more detailed understanding of herirachical galaxy formation models .    lcc + parameter & ugc 4722 & ugc  4722c + r.a.(j2000.0 ) & 09 00 23.54 & 09 00 26.11 + dec.(j2000.0 ) & + 25 36 40.6 & + 25 38 21.4 + @xmath97 ( from ned ) & 0.17 & 0.17 + @xmath44 & 15.01@xmath98 & 19.53@xmath98 + @xmath44 & & 17.21 ( c+plume ) + @xmath28(hi)(km",
