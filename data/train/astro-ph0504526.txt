    "it is generally believed that the r - process is associated with supernova ( sn ) explosions ( meyer et al .",

    "2003 ) in which a neutron - rich environment is realized .",
    "however , the astronomical site for the r - process has not been unambiguously determined .",
    "clarifying the origin of the r - process and understanding the heavy element production therein are currently important subjects in astrophysics .    in the present work , we attempt to clarify the effects of nuclear physics uncertainties in r - process nucleosynthesis by investigating the dependence of the r - process yields on the nuclear reaction rates and also on the explosion environment . in particular , we first identify the most important light - mass nuclear reactions for the r - process by using the concept of reaction `` sensitivity '' as defined in section [ sensitivity ] .",
    "we discuss the nucleosynthesis network in section [ network ] , and describe three representative dynamic flow models in section [ wind ] .",
    "the results of deduced reaction sensitivities are given in section [ results ] , where we also investigate the sensitivity of the most important light - element reactions on the explosion conditions .",
    "our defined `` sensitivity '' for the efficiency of the nuclear reactions is shown to be a useful measure of the production of actinides . in this context",
    "it is also relevant to cosmochronology . in section [ carbon ]",
    "an illustration is given based upon a detailed analysis of the waiting point for neutron - rich carbon isotopes .",
    "this study highlights both the uncertainty and importance of obtaining experimental data , as well as the role of @xmath2,n ) reactions along the r - process path for light nuclei .",
    "the most probable astronomical site for the r - process is in core - collapse supernovae ( e.g. type ii , ib , ic sne ) .",
    "this is supported by the observational fact that the abundance pattern of metal deficient stars has an apparent universality , and is very similar to the solar abundance distribution ( sneden et al .",
    "1996 , honda et al .",
    "2004 , etc . ) .",
    "metal - poor stars ( [ fe / h ] @xmath3 -3 ) have only been influenced by one or two supernovae .",
    "the fact that the r - process abundance pattern of these early objects is quite similar to the solar abundance distribution suggests that supernova explosions have supplied r - process elements in a similar manner both in the past and in more recent times .",
    "although supernova explosions are not yet fully understood , it has been established ( meyer et al . 1992 ; woosley et al .",
    "1994 ; witti , janka & takahashi 1994 ) that some conditions of supernova hydrodynamics ( i.e. the hot - bubble region formed by a @xmath4-driven wind ) can produce r - process conditions .",
    "one such condition is an environment with excess neutrons , i.e.  the electron fraction @xmath5 is less than 0.5 .",
    "sufficient neutrons per seed nucleus are a necessary condition for a successful r - process .",
    "the r - process occurs effectively when the neutron - to - seed ratio is large . here , `` _ seed _ '' means nuclei whose mass number is typically between 70 and 120 ( including for example @xmath6 ) .",
    "such seed nuclei are made through the @xmath7-process ( woosley & hoffman 1992 ) .    in the wind models",
    "the r - process conditions are achieved even for modest @xmath5 in an environment with high entropy . when the entropy per baryon is large , @xmath8 200 ( woosley et al .",
    "1994 , takahashi and janka 1997 ) , the r - process can occur from the initial condition in which most nuclei are dissociated into alpha particles plus free neutrons and protons .",
    "another condition is that of a short dynamical timescale ( otsuki et al . 2000 ) , where the dynamical time , @xmath9 , is defined as the e - fold decay time of the temperature from an initial value of @xmath10 mev ( qian & woosley 1996 ) . a short dynamical time can suppress the overproduction of seed nuclei , leaving plenty of free neutrons for the subsequent neutron - capture flow",
    "this is because the temperature drops so rapidly that the @xmath7-process becomes ineffective to produce seed .",
    "if the dynamical timescale of the neutrino - energized wind is as short as @xmath11 5 ms ( otsuki et al .",
    "2000 ) , the 3rd extended r - process peak and even actinide nuclei can be produced .    moreover , there are now two views about the r - process in supernovae . in one",
    "view supernova explosions are the universal site of the r - process ( qian & woosley 1996 ) . in the other view ,",
    "not only supernovae but also some other phenomenon has contributed to the r - process ( qian & wasserburg 2000 )",
    ". such a site might be the grb environment ( cameron 2001 , 2003 ; inoue et al .",
    "2003 ) , hypernovae or collapsars ( pruet , woosley & hoffman 2003 ; fujimoto et al . 2004 ) , or neutron star mergers ( freiburghaus , rosswog & thielemann 1999 ) . in the present work",
    ", we will take the former position , @xmath12 that heavy elements , including even the 3rd peak and actinide nuclei , can be sufficiently synthesized in supernovae .",
    "in particular , we consider the hot - bubble scenario containing @xmath4-driven winds in gravitational core - collapse type ii supernovae .",
    "obviously , there remain many questions surrounding the r - process . in order to ultimately identify the astrophysical site for the r - process",
    "it is essential to clarify the effects of the uncertainties in the input nuclear physics on the production of r - process nuclei .",
    "that is the aim of the present study .",
    "in analogy with the power - law technique applied by bahcall ( 1982 ) to analyze the sensitivity of nuclear reactions to the solar neutrino flux , we express the calculated abundances @xmath14 of r - process nucleosynthesis as @xmath15 where the subscript @xmath16 stands for typical r - process elements at the 2nd or 3rd peak , or the actinides . specifically , we define @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 as usual , @xmath20 denotes the number fraction of element a , where @xmath21 is the number density , @xmath22 is the baryon mass density , and @xmath23 is avogadro s number .",
    "@xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 include the abundances of several typical r - process elements , e.g. @xmath27xe and @xmath28te for the 2nd peak , @xmath29pt for the 3rd peak , and @xmath30th , @xmath31u , or @xmath32u for the actinides , as shown in figure [ f0 ] .",
    "although the r - process abundance peaks change slightly , depending on the adopted hydrodynamics flow models , our conclusions are rather insensitive to the specific peak elements used in eqs .",
    "( [ y2nd])- ( [ yacti ] ) .",
    "the @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ ys ] ) are the thermonuclear reaction rates , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the reduced mass of the incident particles , @xmath36 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath37 is the temperature of the gas under consideration .",
    "@xmath38 is the adopted `` standard '' value of the i - th reaction rate in the reaction network as described in section [ network ] .",
    "thus @xmath39 ( @xmath16 = 2nd or 3rd ) is the r - process yield for these @xmath40 values .",
    "note , that a variation of the thermonuclear reaction rate from @xmath38 to @xmath33 must include the corresponding change of the reverse rate .",
    "the reaction cross sections @xmath41 have both resonant and continuum background contributions in general .",
    "this can lead to different temperature - dependences of the thermonuclear reaction rates .",
    "nevertheless , most of the reactions of interest here have only a modest temperature dependence .",
    "hence , we here only take into account changes in the strength of @xmath33 , assuming the same @xmath37-dependence . the power index @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ ys ] ) is hereafter called the `` sensitivity '' parameter .      in general , the sensitivity parameters @xmath42 will depend upon the physical conditions of the r - process site .",
    "previous studies ( e.g.  meyer et al .",
    "1992 ; woosley et al . 1994 ; qian and woosley 1996 ; otsuki et al .",
    "2000 ; terasawa et al .",
    "2002 ) have identified four physical parameters which characterize the physical conditions of the r - process .",
    "these are : 1 ) the entropy per baryon @xmath43 ; 2 ) the expansion time scale @xmath9 ; 3 ) the initial electron fraction @xmath44 , and the asymptotic boundary temperature @xmath45 of the adopted wind model .",
    "values of these parameters appropriate to the models considered here will be given in the section [ wind ] .",
    "our adopted sensitivity formula , eq .",
    "( [ ys ] ) , has several advantages : first , although r - process nucleosynthesis in sn explosions is complicated , the dependence of the final yields on each nuclear reaction rate is expressed in a simple separable form .",
    "this makes the analysis of the reaction sensitivity very simple no matter how complex the explosion dynamics are .",
    "secondly , eq .  ( [ ys ] ) represents even the highly non - linear effects of the complicated reaction processes in large - scale nuclear reaction networks .",
    "the larger the @xmath46 , the more strongly the r - process yields depend on the i - th nuclear reaction rate",
    ". if the @xmath42 are close to unity , the r - process yields are linearly dependent on that thermonuclear reaction rate .",
    "if the @xmath13 are close to 0 , the r - process yields are not affected .",
    "note , however , that @xmath47 does not mean that the r - process is totally independent of the i - th nuclear reaction .",
    "for example , @xmath42 @xmath48 0 can occur whenever the reaction collision time scale , @xmath49 , is smaller than the expansion time scale , i.e.  @xmath50 , as is the case for a classical r - process .      since @xmath13 is a function of the @xmath51 s , the logarithm of eq .",
    "( [ ys ] ) can be written as a taylor series expansion in powers of @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 for all j@xmath55 .",
    "the factor + @xmath56 in the second term does not vanish in general . in practice , however , this coherent term between @xmath33 and @xmath51 ( @xmath57 ) is small for the adopted standard @xmath38 values . hence we can set @xmath58 and @xmath59 . equation ( [ approx ] ) is thus well approximated by only the first sum of the power series @xmath60 the validity of this incoherent approximation will be justified in numerical analysis below in appendix a.    although several important reaction cross sections of the light - mass nuclei have been studied both experimentally and theoretically , they still have appreciable uncertainties which may affect the final r - process yield .",
    "these will be discussed in section 3 .",
    "the adopted range of @xmath61 may be beyond the range to be justified in the incoherent approximation ( [ approx ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , our calculated @xmath42 values for a wide range of @xmath62 are still useful as a means to characterize the associated changes in @xmath14 to be expected as more precise experiments or theoretical determinations of reaction rates become available .",
    "for the calculations of r - process nucleosynthesis , we employ the reaction network used in otsuki et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , which was developed from the original dynamical network code calculations described in meyer et al .",

    "this decrease in the neutron - to - seed ratio is not favorable for the r - process .",
    "it is the reason that the abundances of both the 2nd and 3rd peak elements decrease for @xmath177 @xmath178 . on the other hand , only the abundance for the 2nd peak decreases toward smaller @xmath175 in the region of @xmath179 .",

    "the only difference from the well studied waiting - point nuclei in heavier - mass regions ( like @xmath28cd and @xmath231sn ) is that @xmath7-capture is an additionally important flow which competes with neutron capture and @xmath0-decay in the light - mass region .",
    "this specific feature arises from the fact that the @xmath7-process , which proceeds prior to the neutron - capture flow on the intermediate - to - heavy mass nuclei , occurs at early times in the high temperature and high density of various expansion of the neutrino - driven wind .",
    "we also studied extensively the dependence of the sensitivity on the expansion flow models .",
    "we adopted exponential flow models to simulate various expansion dynamics and calculated the sensitivity .",
    "the four important physical parameters which characterize the profile in the flow models are the dynamical timescale @xmath9 , the entropy per baryon @xmath43 , the initial electron fraction @xmath5 , and the asymptotic temperature @xmath45 .",
    "we found that the sensitivities depend most strongly on the dynamical timescale .",
    "nuclear reactions and sn dynamics are thus complementary facets to understanding r - process nucleosynthesis . obviously , more accurate experimental data should help our comprehensive understanding of r - process nucleosynthesis and sn dynamics .",
    "we believe that the present work provides a useful tool to elucidate which reactions are most important and also the synergy between the sn dynamics and nuclear reactions in r - process nucleosynthesis .    this work has been supported in part by grants - in - aid for scientific research ( 13640313 ) and for specially promoted research ( 13002001 ) of the ministry of education , science , sports and culture of japan , and the mitsubishi foundation .",
    "work at the university of notre dame has been supported under doe nuclear theory grant de - fg02 - 95-er 40934 .",
    "we have discussed the reaction sensitivity by making the incoherent approximation , eq .",
    "( [ approx2 ] ) , assuming that @xmath13 is most sensitive to the change of the corresponding i - th nuclear reaction rate @xmath33 and that its dependence on different @xmath51 s ( @xmath232 ) is weak . in order to justify this approximation quantitatively",
    ", we carried out several calculations of @xmath13 by changing two or three reaction rates \\{@xmath51 } simultaneously .",
    "for this purpose we chose the three most important nuclear reactions from tables [ result1 ] and [ result2 ] , i.e. ( 1 ) @xmath233 , ( 2 ) @xmath234 , and ( 3 ) @xmath235 .",
    "these reactions show fairly large absolute values of the sensitivity parameter @xmath13 .",
    "figure [ f2 ] displays the calculated r - process yields , in which we have changed the three reaction rates as indicated .",
    "solid curves show the results of the exact calculation and the dotted curves show the results of making the incoherent approximation @xmath236 where the @xmath13 s are taken from table [ result1 ] for the fast wind model .",
    "the exact ( solid ) and approximate ( dotted ) calculations are in reasonable agreement with each other for the r - process abundances in the 2nd and 3rd peaks . a large deviation ,",
    "however , emerges in actinide elements when the three reaction rates are set to near the lower limits of the estimated uncertainties of the cross sections .",
    "these results indicate that the incoherent approximation is a fairly good approximation , except for the actinide elements .",
    "we attribute this deviation for actinide nuclei to the fact that the three most important reactions change the neutron - to - seed ratio in slightly different manners .",
    "this enhances the sensitivity in the actinide production near the end of the neutron - capture flow along the r - process path .",
