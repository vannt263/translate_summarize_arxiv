    "since the early days of quantum optics , many effects have been observed which are incompatible with the classical electromagnetic theory of light .",
    "already einstein s explanation of the photoelectric effect  @xcite , for which the photon was postulated , was in contradiction to the classical theory and gave rise to quantum mechanics .",
    "later , schrdinger found quantum mechanical states of the harmonic oscillator , which mostly resembled classical behavior  @xcite .",
    "today , these states are known as coherent states of the electromagnetic field .",
    "subsequently , much work has been done to understand the difference between the classical electromagnetic field and the quantum optical counterpart .    in the 1960s , physicists began to treat this problem in terms of phase space distributions .",
    "classically , any state of a single mode of light can be described by a classical probability distribution over complex field amplitudes @xmath2 , which span the so - called phase space .",
    "quantum mechanically , phase - space distributions are not uniquely defined .",
    "well - known examples are the wigner distribution  @xcite , the glauber - sudarshan @xmath1 function  @xcite , and the husimi @xmath3 function  @xcite .",
    "they have been generalized as members of the class of @xmath0-parameterized quasiprobability distributions  @xcite .",
    "the most general form of quasiprobabilities has been given by agarwal and wolf  @xcite .",
    "nonclassicality can be defined by comparing such a quasiprobability with a classical probability distribution .",
    "however , this definition depends on the particular choice of quasiprobability .",
    "the generally accepted definition of nonclassicality has been formulated by titulaer and glauber : whenever the glauber - sudarshan @xmath1 function can not be interpreted as a classical probability density , i.e.  has negativities in some well - defined sense , the state is referred to as nonclassical  @xcite .",
    "this definition is designed in such a way that any correlation function of a classical state can be modelled by classical electrodynamics .",
    "furthermore , the coherent states , which we already mentioned above , are the only pure quantum mechanical states which are classical in this sense  @xcite . however , the @xmath1 function may be highly singular , such that it can not be directly reconstructed from experimental data .",
    "this fact imposes severe difficulties to test nonclassicality of a state in general .",
    "therefore , many nonclassicality criteria had to be developed , such as squeezing  @xcite , sub - poissonian photon statistics  @xcite , inequalities in terms of matrices of moments  @xcite or characteristic functions  @xcite , as well as bounds on probabilities  @xcite .",
    "the most general , but still simple criterion is based on so - called nonclassicality quasiprobabilities  @xcite , which has already been applied in practice  @xcite and connected to nonclassicality witnesses  @xcite .",
    "a frequently used criterion is based on the wigner function .",
    "its negativities are sufficient for nonclassicality in the sense of negative @xmath1 functions , but not necessary  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it can be obtained by standard means of quantum tomography , and therefore contains full information about the quantum state .",
    "therefore , it is readily observed in many quantum optics laboratories and used for nonclassicality tests  @xcite .",
    "maybe it has been this development which led to the proposal to define nonclassicality in terms of the wigner function  @xcite .",
    "naturally the question arises whether this new definition is more suitable than the one based on the @xmath1 function .    in this article",
    ", we strengthen the role of the @xmath1 function as the key quantity for the definition of nonclassicality .",
    "the foundation of our considerations is the superposition principle of the classical electromagnetic field of light , which is employed at every beam splitter in an optical experiment .",
    "we demonstrate that not every general quasiprobability is transformed by a beam splitter in the same way as a classical phase - space distribution .",
    "more precisely , only the @xmath0-parameterized quasiprobabilities behave classically in this situation .",
    "hence they are the only candidates for a reasonable definition of nonclassicality .",
    "furthermore , we show that only the glauber - sudarshan @xmath1 function behaves under the action of an attenuator like a classical phase - space distribution .",
    "hence , it is the only quasiprobability which completely resembles the classical behavior of linear operations on the classical field of light .",
    "this result supports the definition of nonclassicality in terms of negativities of the @xmath1 function , notwithstanding its mathematical complications .",
    "furthermore , it sheds a light on physical problems which will occur when nonclassicality shall be defined by negativities of the wigner function .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we compare the action of a beam splitter on classical phase space distributions and quantum - mechanical quasiprobabilities . in sec .",
    "iii , the attenuator is analyzed for classical and quantum optics . in sec .",
    "iv , we give some explicit examples to demonstrate that only the @xmath1 function can distinguish between classical and nonclassical behavior correctly , and show that a state with a nonnegative wigner function may lead to measurement results which can not be explained by classical electrodynamics .",
    "let us consider the electric field of a monochromatic light wave with a fixed frequency @xmath4 .",
    "the spatial dependence of the field shall be neglected in this manuscript .",
    "then , the field can be fully characterized by a complex amplitude @xmath2 @xmath5 the maximum amplitude is given by @xmath6 , and the phase can be specified by @xmath7 .",
    "the set of all complex @xmath2 is referred to as phase space .",
    "a characteristic feature of light is the possibility of linear superposition of electromagnetic fields , which can be achieved by a beam splitter , see fig .",
    "[ fig : beamsplitter ] .",
    "the relation of input and output fields @xmath8 are given by @xmath9 where the matrix @xmath10 has to be a unitary one . throughout the manuscript",
    ", we set the global phase @xmath11 .",
    "instead of considering the fields , this map can also be considered in terms of the complex amplitudes @xmath12 , @xmath13 if all parameters are non - zero , the knowledge of two arbitrary amplitudes @xmath14 complete determines the missing two amplitudes .",
    "this is trivial if the amplitude @xmath15 or @xmath16 are given .",
    "if @xmath17 are known , the missing two fields are determined by .",
    "@xmath18 all other cases can be treated analogously .",
    "therefore , whenever two classical fields @xmath19 , @xmath20 are given , there exist two additional classical fields such that eq .",
    "is satisfied .",
    "moreover , we may consider a statistical ensemble of fields , modelled by a probability distribution @xmath21 .",
    "in this situation , every physical quantity @xmath22 has to be averaged over this probability distribution , @xmath23 the action of a beam splitter on a two - mode input field characterized by its joint probability density @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 therefore , for each classical input field ensemble there exists a classical output field , defined by the probability distribution @xmath26 .",
    "due to the linearity of the relations , this holds for an arbitrary choice of two given modes @xmath27 .",
    "quantum mechanically , the expectation value of an arbitrary operator @xmath28 can be calculated in the form @xcite @xmath29 here , the so - called quasiprobability @xmath30 is given by the fourier transform of its characteristic function @xmath31  ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath32 which itself is directly connected to the quantum state of the oscillator , described by its density operator @xmath33 : @xmath34 the filter function @xmath35 characterizes the special kind of the quasi - probability , which we examine more in detail below .",
    "the function @xmath36 is connected to the operator @xmath28 in a similar way , with @xmath37 being a suitable inverse filter .",
    "the different known types of quasiprobabilities are determined by a specific filter @xmath35 . for instance , the wigner function can be obtained by @xmath38 , the @xmath1 function by @xmath39 and the husimi @xmath3 function by @xmath40 .",
    "the latter quasiprobabilities are generalized as @xmath0-parameterized quasiprobabilities in @xcite , where the filter has the form @xmath41 . in general , we require that @xmath35 is an analytic function in @xmath42 and @xmath43 , has no zeros , and satisfies @xmath44 . under this conditions ,",
    "we derive our first important result :    * theorem : * only the s - parameterized quasiprobabilities resemble the classical action of a beam splitter .    _",
    "proof : _ it appears that the action of the beamsplitter on ensembles of electromagnetic fields can be examined in a convenient way in terms of the characteristic function @xmath45 of the probability distribution  , which is defined as @xmath46 then eq .   can be rewritten in terms of characteristic functions as @xmath47 in the following , we seek for the characteristic functions @xmath48 of the quasiprobabilities which also satisfy this equation .",
    "the theorem states that only quasiprobabilities with @xmath49 fulfill this requirement .    to show this",
    ", we first note that in the case of two - mode fields , the filter function of the two - mode characteristic function @xmath48 has to appear as a product of single mode filter functions , @xmath50 then , the action of the beamsplitter on the creation and annihilation operators can be written analogously to eq .  ,",
    "@xcite : @xmath51    let us denote the characteristic function of the wigner function , defined by @xmath52 , as @xmath53 .",
    "we can easily show that eq",
    ".   holds for @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to examine the relation of the beamsplitter on the filter function @xmath35 .",
    "more precisely , any characteristic function @xmath48 satisfies the classical relation eq .",
    "if and only if the filter function @xmath35 satisfies @xmath54 the only conditions which are imposed on the beamsplitter coefficients @xmath55 arise from the unitarity of the matrix @xmath56 in eq .  :",
    "@xmath57 all filter functions @xmath58 which are entire in @xmath59 and have no zeros , can be written in the form ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath60 we may insert this expression into eq .   and compare the coefficients of the series in the exponential functions .",
    "since we require @xmath44 , we need @xmath61 .",
    "let us now examine all powers of @xmath62 with @xmath63 .",
    "comparing both sides of the equation , we find the condition @xmath64.\\ ] ] the equation is fulfilled for a fixed pair @xmath65 if the expression in brackets equals to @xmath66 for all allowed parameters @xmath67 , or if @xmath68 .",
    "it is easy to show that two special cases already lead to a large number of vanishing coefficients :    * if we insert the valid parameters @xmath69 , the term in brackets is given by @xmath70 = 2/\\sqrt{2^{k+l}}\\ ] ] this expression can only be equal to one if @xmath71 . therefore , it is necessary that @xmath68 for @xmath72 as well as @xmath73 . *",
    "if we insert the valid parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and consider the case @xmath71 only , the term in brackets is given by @xmath70 = ( 1 - ( -1)^k)/2,\\ ] ] which equals to @xmath66 if and only if @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , we find @xmath77 .    therefore , after setting @xmath78 we find that only filters of the form @xmath79 are candidates to satisfy eq .  .    as a last step",
    ", we still have to show that the filter function   fulfills eq .  .",
    "to this end , we start with the right hand side of the latter equation : @xmath80/2\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , we can insert the relations   and easily verify that @xmath81/2\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last term exactly equals to the left hand side of the desired equality , cf .",
    "this concludes the proof.@xmath82",
    "so far , we have shown that the action of a beam splitter on quantum mechanical quasiprobability distributions can only resemble the classical behavior if the quasiprobabilities belong to a special class , namely the s - parameterized ones . hence ,",
    "as the @xmath3-function , wigner function and @xmath1 function all belong to this class , they are suitable for a classical description of the beam splitter action .",
    "however , there are @xmath0-parameterized quasiprobability distributions which are still not suitable for the definition of nonclassicality . for instance",
    ", the husimi @xmath3 function always satisfies the requirements for a classical probability density .    in this section",
    ", we will impose an additional requirement .",
    "classically , damping of the electromagnetic field can be considered as the action on the beam splitter , where a signal field @xmath83 is overlapped with the vacuum field @xmath84 , leading to a resulting attenuated field @xmath85 .",
    "the parameter @xmath86 is commonly referred to as ( quantum ) efficiency , which diminishes the amplitude of the signal field .",
    "the joint probability density of the input field is given by the product of the probability densities of the state of interest and the vacuum field , @xmath87 the probability density of the attenuated output field @xmath88 is then obtained as the marginal of @xmath26 , given by eq .  :",
    "@xmath89 vice versa , given an classical output field distribution @xmath90 and the quantum efficiency @xmath91 , there always exists a classical distribution @xmath92 for a classical input field of the attenuation process .    quantum - mechanically , attenuation is also considered as overlapping the signal field with vacuum at the beam splitter , described by quasiprobabilities @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , the input state is described by the quasiprobability @xmath95 this leads us to the following result :    * theorem : * the glauber - sudarshan @xmath1 quasiprobability is the only quasiprobability which allows to describe the action of an attenuator in the same way as the classical electromagnetic theory , see eq .  .",
    "_ proof : _ again , we examine the quasiprobabilities in terms of their characteristic functions .",
    "the classical relation   can be rewritten as @xmath96 on the other side , we have to insert the fourier transform of eq .   into the quantum - mechanical version of eq .",
    ": @xmath97 since we consider only the output mode @xmath98 , we have to take the marginal with respect to the mode @xmath99 . in fourier space , this is simply achieved by setting @xmath100 .",
    "therefore , the output mode @xmath98 is described by the characteristic function @xmath101 comparing this result with the classical expectation in eq .  , we find @xmath102 as the necessary and sufficient condition for the equality of the quantum mechanical and classical quasiprobabilities .",
    "this is only satisfied for the characteristic function of the @xmath1 function , which is obtained by @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath82    we emphasize that the key argument of the proof is that the quasiprobability for the vacuum state exactly equals to the classical probability distribution for a field with zero amplitude , namely @xmath103 .",
    "first , let us illustrate our conclusions with a simple example . for this purpose , we consider the second - order correlation measurement ( fig .  [ hbt - setup ] ) , as it is used for photon - antibunching experiments  @xcite . in classical terms",
    ", the input field @xmath104 is split by the symmetric beam splitter into two output fields @xmath105 , whose intensity correlation is measured , @xmath106 consequently , for any statistical superposition of input fields @xmath104 , the correlation function reads as @xmath107 moreover , one may show that any classical field satisfies the inequality@xcite @xmath108 ^ 2,\\label{eq : classical : inequality}\\ ] ] with the first order correlation function @xmath109 describing the intensity of the input field .",
    "as a first quantum mechanical system , let us consider a single photon , which has a wigner function with negativities as well as a highly singular @xmath1 function . hence , in terms of both quasiprobabilities ,",
    "the photon can be referred to as nonclassical .",
    "we obtain the correlation functions as @xmath110 and @xmath111 obviously , the photon does not satisfy inequality  .",
    "therefore , the outcomes of such an experiment can not be explained by means of classical electrodynamics , and the term `` nonclassicality '' is justified .",
    "however , the situation changes when we examine a slightly different quantum state , namely a single photon , which is attenuated by a value of @xmath112 .",
    "classically , the intensity is simply divided by two .",
    "quantum - mechanically , the field has to be described by effective annihilation operators @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the annihilation operator of the signal field and @xmath115 is the annihilation operator of an auxiliary vacuum field . in this case , the correlation functions are given by @xmath116 and @xmath117 therefore , the classical inequality is still violated .",
    "however , the wigner function of the input state is given by  @xcite @xmath118e^{-2|\\alpha|^2},\\ ] ] being nonnegative for @xmath119 .",
    "hence , in terms of the wigner function , one might state that the quantum state is classical , although the second - order correlation function violates basic laws of classical electrodynamics .",
    "this is also illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : wigner : photon ] : for any positive @xmath120 , the classical bound on the correlation functions is violated , while the wigner function only has negativities for @xmath121 . as we have shown in the previous section ,",
    "the @xmath1 function is the only quasiprobability which resembles the classical behavior of the attenuator , and is free of such a contradiction .    .",
    "negativity of each quantity indicates nonclassicality .",
    "clearly , the wigner function does not indicate nonclassicality for @xmath119 , although the correlation functions violate the classical boundary . ]      in a more general setup , complex moments of the electromagnetic field can be analyzed , @xmath122 since the field amplitude @xmath2 scales with the square root of the attenuation @xmath120 , the moments of the attenuated field are given by @xmath123 due to this fact , inequalities for the correlation functions which set bounds on classical states appear to be independent of the efficiency . for instance , eq .",
    "( 5.6 ) in  @xcite states that for classical fields the condition @xmath124 holds for all @xmath125 .",
    "inserting eq .",
    "directly shows that the latter inequality is satisfied if and only if it is also satisfied for the unattenuated state with @xmath126 .",
    "even more generally , this also holds for field correlation functions measured at different points in space .",
    "most generally , the complete hierarchy of nonclassicality criteria given in  @xcite , based on determinants of moments , is independent of the efficiency , since @xmath120 appears with the same power in each term of any determinant and can be factorized out .",
    "although the latter result has been derived for states with nonnegative @xmath1 function , it also holds for classical mixtures of classical electromagnetic fields .    in conclusion , classicality of a state does not change under the influence of positive efficiency @xmath120 .",
    "conversely , a nonclassical quantum state shall not be changed into a classical one by attenuation .",
    "this key feature is only present in the glauber - sudarshan @xmath1 representation of the state , since it is the only quasiprobability which resembles the same scaling as the classical phase space probability , see eq .  .",
    "as a consequence , its negativities ( i.e.  nonclassicality ) are preserved under the action of beamsplitter and attenuator .",
    "this gives the @xmath1 function its exceptional position in the discussion of nonclassicality , and demonstrates that it is reasonable to consider nonclassicality in the sense of titulaer and glauber in spite of all mathematical challenges .",
    "sometimes it is argued that negativities of the wigner function can be used for the definition of nonclassicality , since it can be seen as the joint probability density for all quadrature measurements  @xcite .",
    "the latter are implemented by balanced homodyne measurements , which are commonly used in most laboratories for quantum state reconstruction . as shown above , a photon undergoing an attenuation of @xmath127 would be argued to be classical , since the joint probability distribution of the quadrature distributions , i.e.  the wigner function , is nonnegative .",
    "indeed , the balanced homodyne measurement result can be explained also by the state of a classical electrodynamic field .",
    "however , the notion of classicality is restricted to this particular type of measurement , and hence does not only depend on the state itself . if the same state is subject to a different measurement , such as the second order correlation measurement discussed above , discrepancies to the classical behavior appear which have not been immediately expected from inspection of the wigner function .",
    "this restricts the usability of the wigner function for defining nonclassicality to a subclass of special measurement setups .",
    "we have examined the action of linear devices , such as the beamsplitter and the attenuator , on quantum mechanical phase - space distributions and compared it with the situation in classical electrodynamics .",
    "our goal was to find out which quasiprobabilities are able to resemble the classical behavior , in order to be useful for the definition of nonclassicality .",
    "we found that for the beamsplitter all @xmath0-parameterized quasiprobabilities , such as the @xmath3 function , the wigner function and the @xmath1 function reflect the classical action .",
    "however , the attenuator can only be described analogously to the classical picture in terms of the @xmath1 function .",
    "therefore , the latter is the only quasiprobability which maps the state of light in the same way as classical linear devices do , preserving the classical properties of a field .",
    "hence , the @xmath1 function possesses properties which are superior for the definition of nonclassicality .",
