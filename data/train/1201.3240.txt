    "cooperative scattering by an assembly of resonant systems has been studied in detail for many years and is based on the seminal work by r. dicke in 1954 @xcite .",
    "related superradiance effects and collective level shifts have been studied in the context of atomic physics in the 70s @xcite . in the last decade , this topic has seen renewed interest @xcite with novel experiments in nuclear physics @xcite and in laser cooled clouds of atoms @xcite , applications in quantum information @xcite and quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "as we are mainly concerned with applications on laser cooled atomic samples , we focus in this paper on specific parameters and observables which are of interest in such experiments . we therefore derive expressions of the radiation pressure force acting on the center of mass of the atomic cloud , as well as the scattered electric field .",
    "we go beyond past approximations including the complex kernel for the coupling terms between n atoms @xcite , described by two - level systems in a scalar approach . neglecting",
    "the complete vectorial nature of the dipole dipole coupling seems a priori more justified in a dilute sample of atoms , where near field corrections are small @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we obtain the force and the radiation field as quantum operators , which may be useful for studying fluctuations and diffusion effects in radiation forces and scattered emission .",
    "also , the imaginary part of the complex kernel , describing the collective lamb shift , is evaluated for a gaussian density profile .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ hamiltonian ] , we specify the hamiltonian used and discuss our approximations . in section [ observables ] , we introduce the observables relevant for experiments with cold atoms , namely the radiation pressure forces on the center of mass of the atomic cloud and the scattered light intensity .",
    "the evaluation of these observables is done for specific atomic states in section [ atomicstate ] .",
    "we derive the result for this cooperative radiation pressure force from a more heuristic approach in section [ heuristicapproach ] . in section [ productstate ]",
    "we discuss the relevance of the timed dicke state compared to a product state for this cooperative pressure force in the low intensity limit before concluding in section [ conclusion ] .",

    "this approximation amounts to neglect saturation and multi - excitation , i.e. all the processes generating more than one photon at the same time ( _ linear regime _ ) . integrating eq.([akbis ] ) and substituting it into eq.([s1bis ] ) , neglecting @xmath28 ( since the initial field state is vacuum ) we obtain @xmath29 the last term in eq.([s1ter ] ) describes the effect of the spontaneously emitted photons on the atoms , and it is well known in the quantum electrodynamic literature @xcite . in the markov approximation ( i.e. when the photon transit time through the atomic sample is much shorter than the excitation decay time @xcite ) , we assume under the integral @xmath30 .",
    "the time integral then yields a real part ( with a term @xmath31 ) and an imaginary part ( corresponding to the principal part of the integral ) . taking into account these two terms is at the origin of the exponential kernel whereas the real part alone would lead to a sin kernel in eq.([kernel ] ) below .",
    "we then transform the sum over the modes @xmath16 into an integral , @xmath32 .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the double integral over @xmath33 and @xmath16 yield the cooperative decay and frequency shift ( collective lamb shift ) , respectively .",
    "the proper expression of the cooperative frequency shift has been obtained adding to the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) the not - rwa contributions associated to virtual photons exchanged between different atoms .",
    "it results the following relation @xcite : @xmath34 where @xmath35 . using eq.([rel : kern ] ) in eq.([s1ter ] ) we obtain @xcite , @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",

    "the real part of @xmath39 describes the spontaneous emission decay and the imaginary part of @xmath39 describes the energy shift due to resonant dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "a slightly different approach can be used to derive this result as shown in appendix [ appendixa ] .",
    "note that even though this result will yield a density dependent collective shift of the resonance , we use a scalar model for the field , neglecting thus any polarization and near field dependence @xcite .",
    "detailed calculations for small and large samples of various geometries however show that near field and far field contributions as well as resonant and antiresonant terms need to be taken properly into account for quantitative predictions @xcite , and the present model thus needs to be considered with care illustrating only a part of the dipole - dipole coupling for real systems .",

    "among the different observables of the system , scattered light and radiation pressure force contain important signatures of cooperative scattering .",

    "we obtain @xmath45 using eq.([rel : kern ] ) , the markov approximation leads to @xmath46 which has a transparent interpretation as the sum of wavelets scattered by @xmath0 dipoles of position @xmath1 and detected at distance @xmath47 and time @xmath33 . in the far field limit , @xmath48 and @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",

    "eliminating the field using eq.([akbis ] ) , eq.([force - emi ] ) becomes @xmath55 assuming the markov approximation , @xmath56 , then eq.([force - emi:2 ] ) becomes @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "the force ( [ fe:1 ] ) acting on the @xmath27th atom has a single - atom contribution @xmath59 ( term @xmath60 in the sum ) accounting for its own photon emission recoil , and a contribution @xmath61 ( terms @xmath62 ) accounting for coupling between the @xmath27th atom and all the other atoms .",
    "note that this dipole - dipole interaction can occur via a coupling to common vacuum modes of radiation .",
    "the interference terms in the total scattered field can leave a fingerprint on the forces acting on the atoms inside the cloud .",
    "the first contribution yields @xmath63 where the sum is over all the randomly oriented modes @xmath64 and we have omitted the self - energy shift ( lamb shift ) coming from the principal part term of the time integral in eq([fe:1 ] ) . noting that for @xmath62 we have @xmath65 , the second contribution to eq.([fe:1 ] ) can be written as @xmath66 using eq.([rel : kern ] ) in eq.([force - emi:3 ] ) , eq.([fe:1 ] ) becomes @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the effective interaction energy between jth and mth atoms . since @xmath69=\\mathbf{r}(ik_0 r-1)\\exp(ik_0 r)/r^3 $ ] , eq.([force - emi:4 ] ) becomes @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",
    "the emission force acting on the @xmath27th atom has two contributions : a ) a self - force due to its own photon emission ; b ) a force due to the dipole - dipole interactions with all the other atoms .",
    "this second force has a term decreasing as @xmath72 and one decreasing as @xmath73 .",
    "the linear approximation assumed in the equations of the atomic operators @xmath74 , eq.([s1:mark ] ) , suggests that we may restrict the hilbert space of the @xmath0 atoms to the subspace spanned by the ground state @xmath75 and the single - excited - atom states @xmath76 with @xmath4 .",
    "hence , we set @xmath77 where we will approximate @xmath78 after having evaluated the different expectation values , e.g. @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",

    "effects are neglected .",
    "one thus needs to consider this shift with some scepticism as the numerical factor for this shift in a real system will be strongly modified by the vectorial nature of the light @xcite . for dilute clouds ,",
    "we recover previous results @xcite , where these density effects are negligible .",
    "we also presented a simple model to estimate the radiation pressure force from the modified emission diagram and assuming coupling to the single photon superradiant ( timed dicke ) state @xcite .",
    "this approach can be useful to estimate not only average forces but also fluctuations and dissipation .",

    "<S> in this paper , we study cooperative scattering of low intensity light by a cloud of n two - level systems . </S>",
    "<S> we include the incident laser field driving these two - level systems and compute the radiation pressure force on the center of mass of the cloud . </S>",
    "<S> this signature is of particular interest for experiments with laser cooled atoms . including the complex coupling between dipoles in a scalar model for dilute clouds of two - level systems , we obtain expression for cooperative scattering forces taking into account the collective lamb shift . we also derive the expression of the radiation pressure force on a large cloud of two - level systems from an heuristic approach and show that at lowest driving intensities this force is identical for a product and an entangled state . </S>"
