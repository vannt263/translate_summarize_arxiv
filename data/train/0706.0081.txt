    "this is the third in a series of papers on a comparative direct analysis of the optical spectra of type  ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) .",
    "paper  i ( branch et  al .",
    "2005 ) was concerned with a time series of spectra , from 12 days before to 115 days after the time of maximum light , of the well  observed , spectroscopically normal , type  ia sn  1994d .",
    "paper  ii ( branch et  al . 2006 ) concentrated on near  maximum  light spectra of 24 sne  ia . in this paper",
    "we focus on pre  maximum  light spectra , which form in the outermost layers of the ejected matter and provide clues to the nature of the explosions that can not be obtained from later spectra that form deeper in the ejecta .",
    "our emphasis is on line identifications , which are needed in the quest to develop good hydrodynamical explosion models for sne  ia . when detailed spectrum calculations are carried out for explosion models ( e.g. , baron et  al .",
    "2006 ; howell et  al .",
    "2001 ) , discrepancies between synthetic and observed spectra invariably appear . knowing the identities of the observed features provides clues to how the explosion models should be modified in order to achieve better agreement with observation .",
    "in paper  ii we divided the maximum  light spectra into four groups : _ core  normal ; broad  line ; cool ; _ and _ shallow  silicon _ ( denoted cn , bl , cl , and ss , respectively , in the figures and tables of this paper ) .",
    "the group assignments were made on the basis of measurements of the ( pseudo ) equivalent widths of absorption features near 5750  and 6100 , as well as on the appearance ( depth , width , and shape ) of the 6100  absorption , which is produced by the si  ii 6355 transition .",
    "although we framed the presentation and discussion in terms of the four groups , in the end we concluded that for the most part the spectra appeared to have a continuous distribution of properties , rather than consisting of discrete subtypes . therefore , exactly how the group boundaries were drawn was not important .",

    "2006 ) , sn  2003du ( gerardy et al . 2004 ) , and sn  2004s ( krisciunas et  al .",
    "2006 ) ; the broad  line sn  1983 g ( mccall et  al . 1984 ) and sn  2002er ( kotak et al .",
    "2006 ) ; and the shallow  silicon sn  1999aa ( garavini et  al .",
    "2004 ) , sn  1999ac ( garavini et  al . 2005 ) , sn  2000e ( valentini et  al .",

    "chandrasekhar sn  ia , also known as snls-03d3bb ; howell et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) ; jeffery , branch , & baron ( 2007a ) ; but see also hillebrandt , sim , & rpke ( 2007 ) ] .",
    "sn  1999ac is a borderline case : in figure  1 it falls between two core  normals but on the basis of the shape , depth , and width of 100 , we include it with the shallow  silicons .    to a large extent",
    "the premaximum spectra turn out to exhibit the defining characteristics of the four maximum  light groups of paper  ii , so we use the same terminology in this paper ( with all group assignments based on maximum  light , not premaximum , spectra ) .",
    "again , we are not suggesting that sne  ia actually consist of discrete subtypes ; instead , we are thinking in terms of three inhomogeneous groups radiating outward ( in figure  1 ) from the highly homogeneous core normals .    in figure  1 , three lines of constant @xmath5 ratio are shown .",
    "this ratio is similar to although not the same as the well known @xmath6 ratio ( nugent et  al .",
    "1995 ) , which is based on the depths of the same two absorption features .",
    "considerable diversity at a given @xmath5 ratio is evident , especially at the low value of 0.05 , e.g. , the sn  2005hk , sn  1999ee , and sn",
    "2002bf have similar @xmath5 ratios but otherwise thei spectra are very different .    in this paper , as in papers  i and ii , we confine our attention to optical spectra , from the ca  ii h&k feature in the blue ( @xmath7 ) to the ca  ii infrared triplet ( ca  ii ir3 ) in the red ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "all spectra have been corrected for the redshifts of the parent galaxies .",
    "the original spectra have a range of slopes , owing to intrinsic differences , differences in the amount of reddening by interstellar dust , and observational error . because we are interested only in the spectral features , and not in the underlying continuum slopes , all spectra in this paper , both observed and synthetic ,",
    "have been flattened according to the local normalization technique of jeffery et  al .",
    "( 2007b ) .",
    "the flattening facilitates comparison of the spectral features .",
    "mild smoothing also has been applied to some of the spectra .",
    "we examined all of the sn  ia premaximum spectra available to us and selected two samples : a `` one  week premax '' sample , consisting of one spectrum each of 21 sne  ia observed between day  @xmath9 and day  @xmath10 with respect to the time of maximum brightness in the @xmath11 band , and an `` early '' sample , consisting of one spectrum each of eight sne  ia observed on or earlier than day  @xmath12 .",
    "( all sne of the early sample are also in the one  week premax sample . )",
    "the sne  ia and the epochs of the selected spectra are listed in table  1 .",
    "continuing our attempt to provide an internally consistent quantification of sn  ia spectra , we have used the  code to fit all spectra of table  1 .",
    "descriptions of  and its use can be found in branch et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) and paper  i. compared to other supernova synthetic  spectrum codes , synow is simple , but when working in an empirical spirit from the data , as opposed to evaluating an explosion model , synow offers the advantage that the user has direct control over line optical depths as function of radial coordinate , while other codes input composition and density structures and then compute the temperature structure and the line optical depths .",
    "thus synow is the most useful code for making line identifications ( pending eventual confirmation by means of detailed calculations for explosion models whose spectra and light curves match the observations ) . for the present work ,",
    "we adopt precepts for fitting spectra that are much like those of paper  ii , e.g. , the default excitation temperature is 7000  k for the cool sn  1986 g and sn  1999by and 10,000  k for all others .",
    "figure  2 shows the spectra of the seven core ",
    "normals of the one  week premax sample .",
    "the spectrum of sn  2001el differs from the others ; as shown by mattila et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) , it resembles the day  @xmath13 spectrum of sn  1990n , so it will be discussed below , with the early sample .",
    "the other spectra show considerable homogeneity , although the diversity is somewhat greater than in the maximum  light core  normal sample . the 6100  absorption is deeper in sn  1998bu and sn  2003cg than in the others , and the broad absorption near 4300  is weaker in sn  1994d and sn  1998aq than in the others .",
    "sn  2003du has strong hv ca  ii absorptions near 3700  and 8000  ( although not nearly as strong as in the exceptional sn  2001el ) .",
    "sn  1990n also has a strong absorption near 3700 .",
    "diversity in hv ca  ii was present also in maximum ",
    "light spectra of core  normals .",
    "the synow fitting parameters for core normals of the one  week premax sample are in table  2 .",
    "an example fit , to the day  @xmath14 spectrum of sn  2003du , is shown in figure  3 .",
    "the fit is good and most of the line identifications seem clear .",
    "the most obvious discrepancy , the failure of the synthetic spectrum to match the observed absorption near 3980 , is primarily caused by si  ii 4130 , so we can not remove this discrepancy without doing harm to the fit elsewhere .    the synthetic absorption produced by si  iii 4560 is a bit too blue to match the observed absorption at 4400  ( which is present in most observed spectra of this paper ) .",
    "a better fit could be achieved by using c  iii 4649 instead of si  iii .",
    "but in a synthetic spectrum that contains only si  iii lines the 4560 absorption does occur at the right place to account for the 4400  absorption , and si  iii 5743 also accounts for a weak observed absorption near 5560 . in most premaximum spectra",
    "there is little or no evidence for c  ii features , so it would be surprising to see ubiquitous evidence for the high  excitation ( 29.6 ev ) c  iii line .",
    "therefore , even though neither si  iii feature fits well in the full synthetic spectrum ( the 5743 absorption does not even appear as a distinct feature ) , we assume that these two si  iii lines usually are responsible for the corresponding observed features .",
    "the synthetic absorption produced by si  ii 5972 does not account well for the observed absorption at 5750 .",
    "this and the other two discrepancies mentioned above are generic to our fits . the fit could be improved by invoking fe  iii lines with a higher excitation potential , at or approaching 15,000  k , so that lines near 6000contribute to the 5750  absorption [ see branch et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) on sn  1998aq ] .",
    "but the problem with the 5750  absorption occurs in some spectra in which we see no evidence for the stronger fe  iii lines in the blue , so we refrain from using high  excitation fe  iii to resolve this discrepancy .",
    "another way to improve the fit , in some cases , would be to use a higher si  ii optical depth and impose a maximum velocity on si  ii ( see  3 and  4 ) .    in our fits to the core normals of the one  week premax sample , the relative weakness of the absorption near 4300  in sn  1994d and sn  1998aq",
    "is accounted for by using lower mg  ii and fe  iii optical depths ( see table  2 ) . in the same two sne we have used c  ii lines , to allow 6580 to improve the fit near the peak of the si  ii 6355 feature .    figure  4 shows the spectra of the three core  normals ( and the two broad  lines , to be discussed in  3 ) of the early sample .",
    "the diversity among the core ",
    "normals of the early sample is much greater than in the one  week premax sample , e.g. , the three 6100  absorptions have distinctly different shapes , and in sn  1994d the absorption trough from 4600 to 5000  is deeper than in sn  1990n and sn  2003du .",
    "the early spectrum of sn  1994d is an example of group crossover : the spectrum is more like that of the broad  line sn  2002bo than like the other core  normals .",
    "( on the other hand , the spectrum of the broad  line sn  2002er could pass for core ",
    "normal . )",
    "the synow fitting parameters for the three core  normals ( and the two broad  lines ) of the early sample are in table  3 . the deeper 4600  to 5000  absorption trough in sn  1994d",
    "is accounted for primarily by using stronger hv fe  ii .",
    "how to fit the various shapes of the 6100  absorption is an interesting issue . for sn",
    "1994d we fit it in the conventional way , with a simple pv si  ii component ( a fit is shown in paper  i ) .",
    "for sn  2003du , the feature appears to consist of two marginally resolved components ( stanishev et  al .",
    "2007 ) , so we use",
    "both pv and hv si  ii .",
    "the fit is shown in figure  5 .",
    "( we did not need to use hv si  ii for the one  week premax spectrum of sn  2003du . )    the unusual , nearly flat  bottomed 6100  absorption of the early spectrum of sn  1990n has been discussed by several authors ( jeffery et  al .",

    "( 2005 ) showed that the one  week premax spectrum of sn  2001el resembled the early spectrum of sn  1990n ( see their figure  1 ) .",
    "as can be seen by comparing our figures  2 and 4 , the hv absorption of the ca  ii infrared triplet is much deeper in sn  2001el ( requiring a covering factor approaching unity ) , but otherwise the two spectra , including the 6100  absorption , are quite similar .",
    "mattila et  al",
    ". attributed the flat  bottomed shape of the 6100  absorption to line formation in a shell that is geometrically thin compared to the size of the photosphere , but this explanation is not viable .",
    "line formation in a thin shell that is not detached from the photosphere does produce a ( shallow ) flat  bottomed absorption [ see figure  8 of jeffery & branch ( 1990 ) ] , but the blue edge of the absorption is blueshifted only by an amount that corresponds to the photospheric velocity , which is not the case in the spectra of sn  1990n and sn  2001el .",
    "we can nicely fit the flat  bottomed absorptions with a single si  ii component , using a high value of @xmath15 and imposing a maximum velocity .",
    "however , since the blue edge of the absorption corresponds to a high velocity comparable to that at which the hv ca  ii and hv fe  ii are forming ( @xmath16 ) , it seems more reasonable to assume that the the feature is is an unresolved blend of pv and hv components , and fit the absorption accordingly ( see table  2 for sn  2001el and table  3 for sn  1990n ) .",
    "support for this interpretation is provided by a previously unpublished spectrum of sn  1990n obtained at day  @xmath17 in bad weather by s.  benetti and m.  turatto ( figure  6 ) .",

    "week premax we use fe  iii optical depths for the shallow  silicons that are comparable to or lower than for the core  normals and the broad  lines . the same was true at maximum light ( although we failed to mention it in paper  ii ) .",
    "at maximum and one  week premax , fe  iii features are conspicuous in shallow ",
    "silicons only because there is less competition from other features .",
    "it is interesting to consider some of the implications of the fitting parameters , especially the line optical depths , in the context of the local  thermodynamic  equilbrium ( lte ) calculations of hatano et  al .",
    "( 1999a ) .",
    "for example , figure  5 of hatano et  al . shows that in lte near 7500  k the si  ii optical depth can exceed unity in a composition in which hydrogen and helium have burned to carbon and oxygen while the mass fraction of other elements , including silicon , is only solar .",
    "this suggests that the presence of si  ii in the spectrum does not necessarily require synthesized silicon .",
    "however , for this composition the optical depth of fe  ii is predicted to be greater than that of si  ii , which according to us is not the case in premaximum or near  maximum spectra .",
    "figure  6 of hatano et  al .",
    "shows that for a carbon  burned composition , which does include synthesized silicon , the si  ii optical depth exceeds that of fe  ii by a large factor .",
    "therefore , since we do not use pv fe  ii in premaximum and maximum spectra , we expect that wherever pv si  ii is detected , it is produced by synthesized , rather than primordial , silicon .",
    "another interesting example is that for the core ",
    "normals of the one  week premax sample , the si  ii optical depths range from four to eight ( and for the core ",
    "normals of the maximum  light sample it ranged from six to 13 ) .",
    "figure  6 of hatano et  al .",
    ", for the carbon  burned composition , shows that a temperature difference of only 800  k is sufficient to change the si  ii optical depth by a factor of two .",
    "this temperature sensitivity makes the high degree of homogeneity among the core ",

    "spectra of sne  ia , hv ca  ii is ubiquitous ( mazzali 2005b ; and this paper ) , and in paper  ii and we regularly invoked hv ca  ii even at maximum light .",
    "the identification of hv fe  ii , which usually appears at modest strength in a crowded spectral region , is perhaps not definite , but we have invoked it regularly both in this paper and in paper  ii at maximum light .",
    "one thing that is clear , from flux spectra ( thomas et  al .",
    "2004 ; tanaka et  al .",
    "2006 ) and especially from polarization measurements ( wang et  al . 2003 ; kasen et  al .",
    "2003 ) , is that in at least some cases the hv ca  ii features form in asymmetrical structures .",
    "the _ origin _ of the hv features is unclear .",
    "one possibility is that for one reason or another they form naturally in the ejecta ( hatano et  al .",
    "an alternative , favored by gerardy et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) and quimby et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) , is that they form in a shell of restricted velocity interval and elevated density that is produced by interaction between the ejecta and circumstellar matter ( an accretion disk , a filled roche lobe , or a common envelope ) .",
    "our identification of hv fe  ii , if correct , may hint that the features can form naturally in the ejecta , because more often than not we detached hv fe  ii at a lower velocity than hv ca  ii .",
    "in the spectra of the early sample , it is unlikely that the hv fe  ii features are produced by iron resulting from decay the decay of @xmath24ni and @xmath24co , because lines of hv ni  ii and hv co  ii also would be expected ( see figure  9 of hatano et  al .",
    "1999a ) , but it is possible that the hv fe  ii features are produced by iron that has been freshly synthetisized along with @xmath24ni .",
    "another hint that the hv features may arise naturally in the ejecta is that in some cases we see hv si  ii at about the same velocity as hv ca  ii and hv fe  ii . in the circumstellar interaction scenario , the blue wing of the si  ii absorption",
    "is predicted to be truncated rather than extended ( gerardy et  al .",
    "2004 ; quimby et  al .",
    "2006 ) . in any case , it is interesting that that hv features , of ca  ii , fe  ii , and si  ii typically are detached not far from 20,000 .",
    "the density and/or composition structure of most sne  ia seems to have something special around 20,000 , probably including a density increase ( mazzali et  al .",
    "2005a ; mazzali 2005b ) .",
    "the day  @xmath13 spectrum of the broad  line sn  2002bo ( figure  8 and table",
    "3 ) raises an issue about the definition of hv and pv features .",
    "we did not use hv ca  ii or hv si  ii , and what we called hv fe  ii was only mildly detached , at 22,000 , from the photosphere at 20,000 .",
    "thus the absence of hv ca  ii or hv si  ii is a matter of definition : ca  ii and si  ii are forming at 20,000 , as in other sne  ia , but they are not referred to as hv simply because of the high velocity at the photosphere .",
    "the issue of carbon also is interesting for constraining explosion models .",
    "as discussed in  2 , a c  iii line could be used to improve our fits for core ",
    "normals but we suspect that it would be spurious .",
    "we have used c  iii to improve the fits for several shallow  silicons but in no case is the identification convincing .",
    "marion et  al ( 2006 ) have established that c  i lines are not detected [ except in cools : howell et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) ] , but their conclusion that carbon is much less abundant than oxygen depends strongly on their assumption of lte at 5000  k. a temperature of 5000  k seems too low to account for the strengths of other lines ( e.g. , fe  iii ) and at higher temperatures the upper limit on the carbon  to  oxygen ratio would be much lower ( see figure  5 of hatano et  al .",
    "1999a ) .",
    "lines of c  ii offer the best prospects for detecting the presence of carbon .",
    "evidence has been presented for the strongest optical c  ii line , 6580 , in sn  1998aq ( branch et  al .",
    "2003 ) ; sn  1990n ( jeffery et  al .",
    "1992 ; mazzali 2001 ) ; sn  1999ac ( garavini et  al .",
    "2005 ) ; and sn  1994d and sn  1996x ( branch et  al .",
    "2003 and paper  i ) .",
    "thomas et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) presented the most convincing evidence , in sn  2006d .",
    "a 6580 absorption was clearly present at day  @xmath14 and day  @xmath9 , and it weakened as maximum light was approached . in this paper we have invoked c  ii in these events and only one other : the early spectrum of sn  2003du , but in this case c  ii 6580 is being used mainly just to beat down the si  ii 6355 emission peak and the identification is not convincing . thus , even at premaximum , c  ii is elusive , or , as thomas et  al . put it , sporadic , perhaps due to its tendency to appear in clumps . if the clumps are few in number and none happen to be in front of the photosphere , no absorption features will be seen .",
    "even if a clump is in front of the photosphere , if it has sufficiently high line  of  sight velocity ( about 15,000  or more ) the 6580 absorption may be blueshifted into the si  ii absorption and not be detectable .",
    "therefore , although c  ii is seen in only a fraction of premaximum sn  ia spectra , the ubiquitous presence of carbon clumps in the outer layers of sne  ia is not excluded .",
    "unburned carbon at the observed velocities is not characteristic of published delayed  detonation models .",
    "another issue to be addressed on the basis of premaximum spectra is that of the maximum detectable ejection velocities . from figures  2 , 4 , 7 , 10 , 12 , and 14",
    "we can see that ca  ii absorption is generally detectable up to about 25,000  and sometimes up to about 30,000 .",
    "the highest maximum velocity that has been imposed on ca  ii is 34,000  for sn  2001el .",
    "detectable optical depth in ca  ii can easily be produced with a solar mass fraction of ca  ii , so the maximum velocities of synthesized ca  ii may be lower .",
    "from the same figures we can see that si  ii absorption is generally detectable up to 15,000  and sometimes above 20,000 . the highest maximum velocity that has been imposed on si  ii",
    "is 27,000  for the one  week premax spectrum of sn  1984a .",
    "we have argued above that this absorption is produced by synthesized silicon .",
    "this is consistent with the 11,900  that mazzali , benetti , & hillebrandt ( 2007 ) adopted for a lower limit to the top of the silicon ",
    "rich layer , but the silicon ",
    "rich layer seems to generally extend to much higher velocities .",
    "such high silicon velocities are not characteristic of pure deflagration models .",
    "the presence of carbon at intermediate velocities and silicon at high velocities could be consistent with the pulsating reverse detonation models of bravo & garcia  senz ( 2006 ) .    another velocity  related issue is the possibility that some of the p ",
    "cygni emission components are blueshifted , as they sometimes are in sne  ii ( chugai 1988 ; dessart & hiller 2005 ) . from measurements of the wavelengths of flux maxima blondin",
    "( 2006 ) inferred emission ",
    "line blueshifts of up to 8000  in premaximum sn  ia spectra .",
    "the assumptions on which synow is based ( sharp photosphere and resonant scattering ) do not allow blueshifts of unblended emission ",
    "line peaks , yet our fits do not in general have a problem reproducing the wavelengths of the observed flux maxima . in synow",
    "synthetic spectra the flux maxima are affected by line blending ; sometimes they are a bit too red , consistent with an emission ",
    "line blueshift , but equally often they are a bit too blue . in sne",
    "ia , line blending is a serious problem for establishing that emission ",
    "line peaks are blueshifted .",
    "the premaximum spectra of sne  ia exhibit a rich diversity , which even within each of our four groups probably is multidimensional .",
    "the outer layers of sn  ia ejecta differ in composition , density , and temperature structure , and they have asymmetries - probably both global shape asymmetries as well as composition clumping . understanding the observational diversity in terms of the physical differences is a challenging task that will require more observations and modeling .",
    "flux spectra have much to tell us , but in view of the asymmetries , polarization spectra are a high priority .",
