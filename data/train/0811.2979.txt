    "the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) was constructed to explore the physics of the quark - gluon plasma , a novel state of nuclear matter in which quarks and gluons are not locally confined to color singlet bound states @xcite .",
    "the experiments performed at the rhic facility since the year 2000 have confirmed @xcite that thermalized matter with an initial energy density exceeding 5 gev/@xmath0 ( more than 30 times normal nuclear matter density ) is created in collisions of two heavy nuclei at a center - of - mass energy per nucleon pair @xmath1 gev . the final state is well described in its chemical composition as a hadron gas with temperature @xmath2 mev @xcite , expanding with a collective velocity exceeding half the speed of light .",
    "two primary probes of the properties of this matter before its dissociation into individual hadrons have emerged from the rhic experiments :    1 .",
    "the axial anisotropy of the collective flow pattern ( called `` elliptic flow '' ) of the final - state hadrons with respect to the beam axis in off - central collisions ; 2 .   the suppression of the emission of hadrons with a high transverse momentum @xmath3 , compared with the yield expected from a superposition of independent nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "theoretical studies , discussed below , have related each of these phenomena to a transport coefficient of the produced matter : the elliptic flow has been shown to be highly sensitive to the value of the shear viscosity @xmath4 ; the energy loss responsible for the high-@xmath3 hadron suppression has been shown to be governed a parameter @xmath5 , which specifies the average square of the transverse momentum kicks per unit path length experienced by a parton traversing the matter . remarkably , it turns out that these two parameters are related to each other , if the matter is a quasi - particle medium composed of quasi - particle excitations with the quantum numbers of quarks and gluons , i.  e.  a _ quark - gluon plasma _ in the literal sense of the word @xcite . on the other hand , if the medium is so strongly coupled that no quasi - particle description applies , or if the quasi - particles have different quantum numbers than quarks and gluons , the relation fails to hold .",
    "a reliable measurement of both parameters , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , would enable us to differentiate between such different scenarios .",
    "when two heavy nuclei collide off - centrally , i.  e.  with a nonzero impact parameter @xmath6 , the overlap region is shaped roughly like an american football . in a plane transverse to the beam axis , the region is almond - shaped and can be characterized by a spatial eccentrity @xmath7 .",
    "when such a region is filled with equilibrated matter endowed with a large internal pressure , its geometrical shape ensures that the pressure gradient in the direction of the collision plane is larger than the gradient perpendicular to that plane .",
    "this pressure anisotropy leads to a more violent expansion along the collision plane and thus results in an axially anisotropic transverse ( with respect to the beam axis ) flow pattern , which is commonly characterized by the second fourier moment @xmath8 of the angular distribution of hadrons for a given @xmath3 .",
    "the elliptic flow parameter @xmath8 can be measured as a function of @xmath3 and also for individual hadron species .    .",
    "the large pressure gradient in the horizontal direction ( the collision plane ) causes a faster expansion than in the vertical direction .",
    "the momentum anisotropy is characterised by the elliptic flow parameter @xmath8 .",
    "[ fig1 ] ]    0.05    it is not surprising that the elliptic flow produced by a given geometric eccentricity is related by the ability of the matter to flow freely locally . in fluid dynamics",
    ", this ability is parametrized by the _ shear viscosity _",
    "the shear viscosity describes the response of the medium to flow gradients .",
    "a low value of @xmath4 implies that the matter is insensitive to flow gradients .",
    "relevant scales determining the importance of shear viscosity are : the _ mean free path _",
    "@xmath9 , the _ homogeneity length _ @xmath10 of the flow pattern , and possibly the thermal wave length @xmath11",
    ". the ratio between the mean free path and the homogeneity scale is called the _ knudsen number _ : @xmath12 . when @xmath13 , the fluid can be described by viscous hydrodynamics",
    "; when @xmath14 such a macroscopic description fails , and the fluid has to be described microscopically , e.  g.  by the boltzmann equation .",
    "is caused by the exchange of momentum ( vertical [ blue ] arrow ) between regions with different flow velocity ( horizontal arrows ) .",
    "a small shear viscosity implies a short mean free path for momentum transport in the fluid .",
    "[ fig2 ] ]    0.05    when there is a flow shear , i.  e.  when the flow velocity changes in a direction transverse to the direction of the flow ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) , the shear viscosity is proportional to the distance over which longitudinal momentum can be readily transported transverse to the flow . kinetic theory for a relativistic fluid yields the relation ( @xmath15 is the particle density , @xmath16 the entropy density , @xmath17 the average momentum of a fluid particle ) @xmath18 in other words , a short mean free path or , equivalently , a large transport cross section @xmath19 imply a small shear viscosity .",
    "somewhat counterintuitively , a low shear viscosity thus requires a strongly coupled medium !",
    "on the other hand , a strongly coupled medium can , and often does , have a large shear viscosity , because its degrees of freedom rearrange themselves under the strong interaction , and momentum can be transferred by mechanisms other than particle transport , e.  g.  in solids by phonons , or in polymers by momentum transport along molecular chains .    as a result ,",
    "one finds in most fluids that the dimensionless ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density ( a generalization of the concept of _ kinematic viscosity _ ) first decreases rapidly with temperature , corresponding to an increase of the ratio between potential and kinetic energy , and then increases again below a critical temperature , often coinciding with a phase transition @xcite , due to the emergence of new momentum transport mechanisms .",
    "an exception are scale invariant theories , such as the celebrated supersymmetric su(@xmath20 ) gauge theory at large @xmath20 , for which the ratio @xmath21 continually decreases with increasing interaction strength and asymptotically reaches the value @xmath22 @xcite , which is widely believed to be the lower bound allowed by quantum mechanics and unitarity @xcite .",
    "the question is sometimes raised whether hydrodynamic flow implies local equilibration of the medium .",
    "it is certainly true that a hydrodynamical description can be applied whenever a medium is locally thermalized and the knudsen number is much less than unity .",
    "however , the reverse is not true ! for example , collective motion in a plasma can be enforced by the action of magnetic fields , which effectively limit the ability of particle to move freely and transport momentum over large distances .",
    "this effect is encoded in the theory of _ magneto - hydrodynamics_. another role of magnetic fields in a plasma is their ability to reduce the shear viscosity by a large factor .",
    "plasmas containing spontaneously generated , random magnetic fields are called `` turbulent '' plasmas .",
    "similar mechanisms have been theoretically shown to occur in locally anisotropic quark - gluon plasmas @xcite , and these may give rise to an anomalously low shear viscosity @xcite .",
    "strong gluon fields are also thought to be present in the pre - thermal `` glasma '' phase and may be responsible for a small shear viscosity at early times .",
    "as mentioned before , the shear viscosity of the quark - gluon plasma produced in nuclear collisions at rhic can be constrained by a comparison of the measured elliptic flow parameter @xmath23 with the results obtained by simulations of the transverse expansion in viscous hydrodynamics .",
    "the result of such comparisons @xcite is that the shear viscosity must be quite small , most likely in the range @xmath24 .",
    "the extracted value depends somewhat on the initial conditions for the geometric anisotropy of the fireball used in the hydrodynamics calculations , with the glauber model giving a value near the lower bound and parton saturation models giving a value near the upper bound .",
    "a slightly different way of extracting the value of @xmath21 is by comparing the hydrodynamics simulations with the dependence of the momentum averaged @xmath8 with the data for the average @xmath8 as a function of the charged particle multiplicity @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "this comparison yields the range @xmath26 .",
    "the dominant source of energy loss of an energetic parton traversing a quark - gluon plasma is believed to be gluon bremsstrahlung .",
    "the parton radiates away part of its energy after scattering off mass shell on one of the medium constituents ( also partons if the quark - gluon plasma can be described as a quasi - particulate medium ) . in qcd",
    ", the energy loss can be expressed in terms of a parameter @xmath5 , which describes the rate at which the medium transfers transverse momentum to the fast parton .",
    "if the differential cross section for elastic scattering in the medium is given by @xmath27 , the energy loss parameter is given by @xcite @xmath28 and the energy loss per unit path length is @xmath29 , where @xmath10 denotes the total length of the path in the medium .",
    "the reason for the additional length dependence on the right - hand side of this equation is that also the radiated gluon re - scatters in the medium ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the quadratic path length dependence of the energy loss is characteristic of qcd .     controlling",
    "the transverse momentum exchange determines the rate of radiative energy loss of the parton .",
    "[ fig3 ] ]    0.05    the fact that the radiative energy loss depends on the rate of momentum exchange between the fast parton and the medium allows us to relate the coefficient @xmath5 to the shear viscosity , if the average thermal parton can be described as a quasi - particle with the same quantum numbers as a hard parton , i.e. , a quark or gluon .",
    "we can then apply kinetic theory as discussed in the previous section and relate @xmath4 to the transport cross section @xmath30 of a thermal parton in the medium . in qcd , like in qed , the interaction is , apart from debye screening , long - rangedand thus the transport cross section is dominated by small angle scattering .",
    "hence we find : @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the average center - of - mass energy in a collision between two thermal partons .",
    "if we also make use of the relation @xmath33 for the entropy per particle in a gas of massless particles , we obtain the remarkable relation @xcite : @xmath34 this relation holds under two general conditions , which one may call the `` weak '' coupling scenario ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) :    1 .",
    "the medium is described by nearly massless quasi - particles with the same properties ( quantum numbers ) as high energy partons .",
    "the thermal interactions among medium partons are dominated by small - angle scattering .",
    "these conditions are fulfilled in a perturbative quark - gluon plasma , which can be described by the so - called hard - thermal loop effective theory ; they also hold when the shear viscosity is dominated by anomalous processes in a turbulent quark - gluon plasma .",
    "they do not hold , and the relation is violated , at strong coupling , e.g.  in the strongly coupled @xmath35 supersymmetric yang - mills theory , where @xmath36     ( upper [ red ] line ) and @xmath37 ( lower [ green ] line ) as function of the inverse coupling strength .",
    "the two quantities approximately agree in the weak coupling domain , when a quasi - particle picture applies , but not in the strong coupling domain , where @xmath38 .",
    "[ fig4 ] ]    0.05    0.5 cm",
    "what do the rhic experiments tell us about the validity of this relation for the quark - gluon plasma formed in nuclear collisions at rhic ? for this comparison we have to extract the value of the energy loss parameter @xmath5 from the jet quenching data , i.e.  from the measured suppression of the yield of energetic hadrons .",
    "a comprehensive analysis of the phenix data on @xmath39 suppression in au+au collisions has recently been performed by bass _",
    "@xcite in three different schemes of radiative jet quenching ( asw @xcite , higher twist ( ht ) @xcite , and amy @xcite ) .",
    "all calculations used the same evolution model for the medium , _ viz . _ three - dimensional ideal hydrodynamics .",
    "the table shows the results for all three schemes , always normalized to @xmath40 mev and for a gluon - induced jet .",
    "[ tab : qhat ]     +    .values of the energy loss parameter @xmath5 in gev@xmath41/fm deduced @xcite from the @xmath39 yield in @xmath42 gev au+au collisions at rhic , normalized to gluons and @xmath40 mev .",
    "the scaling of @xmath5 with medium density is either assumed to be proportional to @xmath43 or to @xmath44 , where @xmath7 denotes the energy density of the medium . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as the table shows , there is no consensus yet between the different schemes . for our purposes here , let us adopt the amy scheme , because a more complete analysis has been performed in this scheme , which also includes collisional energy loss in the same framework @xcite .",
    "the additional energy loss mechanism leads to a somewhat lower value of @xmath45 gev@xmath41/fm , corresponding to @xmath46 which nicely falls into the range @xmath47 preferred by the rhic experiments . even more impressive",
    "is the coincidence with the value @xmath48 obtained by meyer @xcite for @xmath49 mev in quenched lattice qcd .",
    "this suggests that the matter produced at rhic is a partonic quasi - particle plasma . [ if",
    ", on the other hand , the value of @xmath5 shown in the table for the asw approach is correct , this would imply a value @xmath50 , which lies far below the kss bound for @xmath51 and thus would prove that the matter is a strongly coupled plasma in the true sense of the word . ]",
    "the shear viscosity @xmath4 and the radiative energy loss parameter @xmath5 , both probe the momentum transport properties of the medium .",
    "a small value of the ( kinematic ) shear viscosity @xmath21 corresponds to a large energy loss parameter . in other words ,",
    "an almost perfect qcd fluid is extremely opaque to particles carrying color charge .",
    "a simple inverse relation holds in all thermal gauge theories , including qcd , at weak coupling . at strong coupling ,",
    "the ratio @xmath21 is limited by the kss bound , but @xmath5 can become arbitrarily large .",
    "the existing approaches to jet quenching do not agree in their conclusions about the physical structure of the quark - gluon plasma produced in nuclear collisions at rhic , some hinting at a `` weakly '' coupled plasma with quasi - particle excitations , and some suggesting a strongly coupled medium .",
    "reliable determinations of @xmath21 and @xmath5 from rhic ( and soon lhc ) data thus have great importance .",
