    "in the last few years compelling experimental evidence has been gathered for charge ordering to be a ubiquitous element of the phase diagram of underdoped cuprates . with different experimental techniques ( resonant x - ray scattering , hard x - ray diffraction , scanning tunneling microscopy(stm ) ) cdws",
    "have been directly detected in underdoped samples of ybcoy123rexs-1,y123rexs-2,y123rexs-3,y123rexs-4,y123rexs-5,y123rexs-6,y123xrd-1,y123xrd-2,y123xrd-3,y123xrd-4,y123xrd-5 , bi-2201@xcite , bi-2212 bi2212rexs-1,bi2212rexs-2,bi2212stm-0,bi2212stm-1,bi2212stm-2,bi2212stm-3 and , recently , hg-1201@xcite compounds .",
    "additional input comes from indirect probes , such as transport measurements y123transp , hgtransp and quantum resistance oscillationsy123qo-1,y123qo-2,hgqo consistent with a cdw - like reconstruction seb1,seb2,sachqo of the fermi surface ( fs ) , nuclear magnetic resonancey123nmr-1,y123nmr-2 , ultrasound propagation @xcite and reflectivity oscillations in pump - probe experiments due to a collective cdw mode y123refl .",
    "the charge order revealed by these experiments has several general features",
    ". for a certain doping range the cdw is present in zero magnetic field with its intensity first appearing below a characteristic temperature @xmath4 ( note that the high - field cdw first observed by nmr@xcite in ybco has been found@xcite to be distinct from the zero - field one ) .",
    "the temperature @xmath4 exceeds the superconducting transition temperature @xmath5 , being generally lower or equal to a pseudogap opening temperature @xmath6 , such that @xmath7 .",
    "the intensity increases on cooling down to @xmath5 , below which it decreases to a finite value at low temperatures .",
    "this picture suggests a competition between this cdw and superconductivity .",
    "the cdw wave vectors have been universally foundy123rexs-5,y123xrd-3,hgxrd , bi2212stm-0 to be directed along the axes of the brillouin zone ( axial cdw ) .",
    "the magnitude of the cdw wave vector is approximately equal for the two orientations and decreases with dopingy123xrd-3,bi2201stm-1,bi2212rexs-2 .",
    "recent studies have revealed one more feature : the intra - unit - cell structure of the cdw in bi-2212@xcite and ybco@xcite is characterized by a dominant d - form factor , _",
    "i.e. _ the charge is modulated in antiphase at two oxygen sites of the unit cell .",
    "the results of the experiments @xcite also suggest that the charge ordering is organized in domains where cdw is along one of the brillouin zone ( bz ) axes only .",
    "this contrasts quantum oscillation experiments@xcite , where a checkerboard cdw modulated along two wave vectors simultaneously was used to describe the reconstruction of the fermi surface .",
    "all these results clearly distinguish this order from the previously observed stripe order in la - based cuprates@xcite because the modulation wave vector for the stripes increases with doping , the form - factor is predominantly of s type@xcite and the charge modulation is accompanied by a static spin order not observed in other high - t@xmath8 compounds .    from the theory perspective , various types of cdws apart from the stripes were previously considered as a possible explanation for the pseudogap phenomenon @xcite .",
    "proximity to an incommensurate cdw transition has been also noted to have an effect on the superconducting properties through fluctuations@xcite in a model including electron - phonon interactions , with the signatures of such fluctuations detected in raman@xcite and arpes responses@xcite .",
    "recently this topic has reappeared in the context of the spin - fermion ( sf ) model , which is known to reasonably reproduce the d - wave superconducting behavior@xcite . in this model",
    "a charge order appears in perturbation theory as a subleading instability@xcite hindered by the curvature of the fermi surface ( however , it has been shown later in ref . that the nearest - neighbor coulomb interaction favors cdw , offering an explanation for the inequality @xmath9 observed experimentally ) .",
    "this subleading state is formed by two coexisting d - wave cdw gaps with wave vectors directed along diagonals of the bz@xcite ( diagonal cdw ) .",
    "it has been shownefetov2013 that this order leads to d - form factor charge modulation on oxygen sites of @xmath10 plane .",
    "it has also been found@xcite that the free energy of the charge ordered state can be close enough to the superconducting ( sc ) state , such that fluctuations between them destroy both the orders . at the same time",
    ", the gap in the spectrum withstands the fluctuations and this phenomenon has been used to explain the pseudogap state in the cuprates .",
    "several other experimentally relevant predictions have been derived based on this picture .",
    "for example , moderate magnetic fields suppress the superconductivity and then cdw appears @xcite in agreement with the experiment @xcite . the core of the vortex should display the charge modulation @xcite and the latter is well seen in , e.g. , stm experiments @xcite .",
    "it is clear that many features of the charge modulation and its competition with the superconductivity are well captured in the framework of the sf model .",
    "however , the direction of the cdw modulation vector observed experimentally in combination with the d - form factor characterizing the intra - unit - cell charge distribution does not agree with the predictions derived on the basis of the sf model . indeed , although the charge modulation obtained in refs .",
    "does have the d - form factor , the modulation vectors obtained there are directed along the diagonals of bz , which contrasts the modulation along the bz axes observed experimentally .",
    "there have been a number of attempts to approach the problem but the resolution does not appear to be straightforward .",
    "axial cdw has been deduced from the sf model in refs .",
    "but the intra - unit - cell structure obtained in these works possesses a large s - form factor component .",
    "a mixture of the states of ref . and ref . suggested in ref .",
    "does not correspond to the experiments either because it still contains the diagonal modulation that is not seen experimentally or the bond modulation that does not correspond to the d - form factor .",
    "cdw considerations using other models do not explain the robustness of axial d - form factor cdw in the cuprates either . in refs .",
    "it has been shown that , provided the antinodal regions of the fermi surface are well nested , a horizontal / vertical instability may become indeed leading but this condition clearly does not hold in , e.g. , bi-2201 , where the fermi surface does not show nesting .",
    "mean - field consideration of a three - band model inkampf2013 leads to the correct direction of the cdw wave vector only for a closed electron - like fermi surface , while the charge order with modulation along the diagonal is dominant for a hole - like fs ( which is the case for underdoped cuprates ) .",
    "the three - band hubbard model was considered also in ref . , where inclusion of vertex corrections led to the correct direction of the cdw wave vector .",
    "however , the obtained form factor has been found to contain substantial s and s components . in ref . and refs .",
    "the pseudogap has been introduced as a separate state related to the parent af phase .",
    "a qualitative agreement has been obtained for some values of interaction parameters , while it remains an open question if pseudogap can be modeled by an af gap , or fl * state as in ref . .    in this paper",
    "we extend the treatment of the sf model beyond the vicinities of eight hot spots to the full antinodal regions of the fs .",
    "this is needed , as is discussed in section [ constr ] , to describe an axial cdw with a true d - form factor and is also motivated by arpes data bi2201arpes-1,bi2201arpes-2,bi2212arpes-1,bi2212arpes-2 showing that the energy separation between the hot spots and @xmath11 is actually quite small .",
    "accordingly , we do not linearize the electron spectrum in the antinodal regions .",
    "in addition to the electron - electron interaction via paramagnons , we consider also the effects of low - energy part of the coulomb interaction , which should not contradict the philosophy of the spin - fermion model .    proceeding in this way",
    "we show that , provided the antinodal fs is close enough to the @xmath12 and @xmath13 points , the leading instability in the d - form factor particle - hole channel is a fermi surface deformation ( known as pomeranchuk instability@xcite ) .",
    "the related phase transition occurs at rather high temperatures @xmath14 .",
    "we assume that the sample is then reorganized in domains with broken c@xmath15 symmetry characterized by different signs of the pomeranchuk order parameter .",
    "as the hole spectrum remains ungapped at @xmath16 the system is susceptible to further instabilities at lower temperatures .",
    "we show that this instability is a cdw with a wave vector along one of the bz axes ( depending on the sign of the pomeranchuk order parameter ) in accord with experiments . in the mean field approximation",
    ", the cdw as well as the superconductivity can appear although fluctuations can mix these states .",
    "thus , the cdw state exists in a form of unidirectional domains with a correspondingly deformed fs .",
    "we point out that , for the cuprates with experimentally known electron spectra , the fs is , indeed , sufficiently close to @xmath11 , which makes the proposed scenario applicable to these compounds .",
    "while the pomeranchuk instability@xcite and closely related electron nematic@xcite orders are known and studied in the context of cuprates ( including coexistence with superconductivity@xcite and effects of fluctuations@xcite ) , they have not been considered within the framework of the sf model and have not been discussed as the reason for the axial d - form factor cdw robustness .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section [ constr ] we discuss the experimental input justifying the underlying microscopic model , while in section [ model ] general equations are formulated . in section [ pom ]",
    "we present the leading particle - hole instabilities for a simplified mean - field model ( [ pomsimpl ] ) yielding analytical results followed by a consideration of the sf model ( [ pomsf ] ) where the solution is obtained numerically . in section [ cdw ]",
    "we discuss the emergence of axial cdw for both the cases .",
    "finally , we discuss in section[concl ] the obtained results and their relevance to the charge order in the cuprates .",
    "as we are going to use the single band sf model , we should present first of all a way to relate the quantities we will obtain to observables in the full @xmath10 plane .",
    "we are mostly interested in the density distribution of holes at the oxygen sites but these sites are not explicitly present in the single band sf model . a simple way to relate the density modulation on the @xmath17 atoms to correlation functions of the sf model has been suggested in ref .",
    "( supplementary information ) where the bond correlation @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 being electron creation and annihilation operators on the neighboring @xmath21 sites , was derived to be proportional to the excess charge density of the @xmath22 atom located on the bond @xmath23 this derivation was based on the assumption that holes entered @xmath22 sites due to a weak tunneling from @xmath21 sites .",
    "experiments@xcite suggest , though , that doped holes enter mostly @xmath22 sites , which is not in agreement with the assumption .",
    "nevertheless , assuming that doped holes form zhang - rice singlets@xcite with @xmath21 holes ( an assumption that seems to hold well according to the experiments@xcite even in the overdoped regime ) , one can come to the same relation between the hole density of the @xmath22 atoms and the bond correlation as the one suggested in ref . .",
    "in appendix [ app1a ] we present a derivation of the formula for the hole density on @xmath22 sites in the absence of an on - site modulation on @xmath21 sites ( s - component ) : @xmath24where @xmath25 is the relative density of doped holes and @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) are creation ( annihilation ) operators for the holes with spin @xmath28 on the @xmath22 atom located between the @xmath21 atoms on sites @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and subscript @xmath31 means that we write in eq .",
    "( [ zrsbond ] ) only the contribution due to the charge order .",
    "it is useful to have an analogous expression also in the continuous limit . considering a @xmath21 atom at a point @xmath32 we write the density at the adjacent @xmath22 sites in the @xmath33 direction as@xmath34where @xmath35 are vectors connecting neighboring @xmath21 atoms ( @xmath36 )    finally",
    ", we express the electron and hole density modulation on cu and o sites , respectively , in terms of the cdw order parameter @xmath37where @xmath38 is the cdw wave vector and the summation is carried over the bz , as@xmath39the modulation @xmath40 corresponds to presence of the s - form factor component of cdw , the modulation @xmath41 gives the s-form factor component , while @xmath42 stands for the d - form factor component .",
    "now we can relate the cdw order parameter to the experimental data for the cdw form factor describing the intra - cell charge distribution .",
    "recent experiments on bscco @xcite and ybco @xcite systems demonstrate that the dominant component is the d - form factor one , which implies that @xmath43 . using eqs .",

    "\\label{d_constr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    let us first discuss the constraint ( [ d_constr0 ] ) .",
    "the order parameter of refs . with the modulation along the diagonals of bz satisfies this condition . in the hot spot approximation",
    ", it follows from the fact that the hot spots connected by the diagonal wave vector always have antiparallel fermi velocities ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] ) and therefore the magnitudes of the order parameters are equal to each other . at the same time , this is not true anymore for the cdw wave vector directed along a bz axis : the fermi velocities at the connected hot spots are no longer antiparallel to each other and moreover , have different angles for hot spots around @xmath13 and @xmath12 .",
    "then , there is no reason for contributions from hot spots around @xmath13 and @xmath12 to have the same magnitudes and therefore the constraint ( [ d_constr0 ] ) is generally not fulfilled .    * *    in the latter case , the absence of the s - form factor ( on - site ) component of the charge modulation encoded in ( [ d_constr0 ] ) can be understood if one recalls that there is a strong coulomb repulsion between the holes on the @xmath45 atoms of the @xmath10 lattice . in effective models , such as the spin - fermion model , this interaction is assumed to lead to antiferromagnetism and critical paramagnons @xcite when the order is destroyed .",
    "one can come to this result ( at least in principle ) after integrating out high energy degrees of freedom .",
    "this means , however , that the low - energy ( low - momentum ) part of the coulomb interaction should still be present in the low - energy effective theory and any additional ( quasi ) static modulation of the @xmath21 atoms should therefore cost a considerable energy . in this situation ,",
    "a charge distribution without any excess charge on the @xmath21 atoms can be quite favorable energetically .    the s constraint ( [ d_constr ] )",
    "turns out to be even more restrictive for models that assume that the cdw amplitude is localized in the vicinities of the points of the fermi surface connected by the cdw wave vector ( hot spots or , as was recently suggested in @xcite , tips of the fermi arcs ) .",
    "it is not difficult to consider the most general case for such models . for both the directions of the cdw",
    "there are only 4 such points ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , regardless of the two modulation directions coexist ( bidirectional ) or not ( unidirectional ) .    * to connect the hot spots , the cdw order parameter w , eq .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) , should be localized at the points 1,2,3 and 4 . left part",
    "is for the order parameter of the modulation along horizontal axis , right  along vertical.,title=\"fig : \" ] *    taking these 4 relevant points of the fs we attribute the order parameter values @xmath46 ,",
    "@xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 to them .",
    "then , the charge modulations on the atoms with a wave vector @xmath38 take the simple form ( we take @xmath38 along x for example )    @xmath50    calculating the modulation amplitudes for different form factors we come to a rather universal ratio between s ( @xmath51 ) and d ( @xmath52 ) components : @xmath53__irrespective of the values of cdw amplitudes at the spots . _",
    "_ this ratio holds for both orientations of the cdw wave vector .    evaluating the ratio in eq .",
    "( [ a5 ] ) for @xmath54 ( taken from ref . )",
    "we find approximately that it equals @xmath55 .",
    "this result clearly violates the experimental bound @xmath56 obtained in ref . indicating that the order parameter can not be concentrated in small regions of hot spots ( whatever this term means ) and one has to consider contributions coming from broader regions of bz .",
    "one should note that this experimental bound is quite conservative because there is no well defined peak observed in the s channel .",
    "in contrast , the result for ybco@xcite is different . taking the experimental modulation vector @xmath57",
    "we obtain the value @xmath58 which is approximately equal to the value @xmath59 suggested in ref . .",
    "therefore , this result does not rule out a possibility that the order parameter in ybco is localized as a function of the momentum near certain points of the bz .",
    "we note that in ref .",
    "the function @xmath60 ,   \\label{a3}\\]]where @xmath61 is a constant , was used to describe experimental data .",
    "this form of the order parameter clearly obeys both the constraints ( [ d_constr0 ] , [ d_constr ] ) .",
    "however , one can show that it contradicts the assumption that the main contributions come from the vicinity of the fermi surface .",

    "[ fig1b ] ) in the antinodal region near the point @xmath67 .",
    "the present consideration shows that , in order to obtain a true d - form factor density wave with a wave vector directed along @xmath68 or @xmath69 axes , one has to formulate the problem in the full antinodal region not restricted to the vicinities of the points connected by the wave vector .",
    "formulating a model of interacting fermions one should thus include a possible strong overlap between different hot spots .",
    "this can be done assuming that the band dispersion near the antinodes is shallow , such that @xmath70 is of the order of the cdw pairing scale ( @xmath71 stands for the energy spectrum and @xmath1 is the fermi energy ) .",
    "actually , this assumption agrees very well with the results of arpes experiments demonstrating that the pseudogap developing in the antinodal regions can be of the same order of magnitude or larger than @xmath72 ( for bi2201@xcite and bi2212@xcite , especially for the antibonding band ) . in the framework of the sf model one can associate the pseudogap scale with the characteristic gap of the model ( @xmath73 in ref . ) . as the gap scale is numerically considerably smaller than the sf interaction scale @xmath74 @xcite , assuming that latexmath:[$%    @xmath74 is a reasonable assumption for the underdoped cuprates ( see also fig.[figmu ] ) .",
    "moreover , the dependence of the energy scale @xmath74 on doping should be weak , unlike the pseudogap and cdw scales which allows to use the approximation above even in the region where pseudogap or cdw become small .    in the next section",
    "we introduce an extended spin - fermion model capable of taking into account the constraints imposed by the experimental facts .",
    "the original sf model has been written @xcite assuming that a mott insulator is formed due to a very strong coulomb repulsion on the @xmath21 atoms and then destroyed by doping .",
    "the philosophy of the sf ( semi ) phenomenology is based on integrating out high energy degrees of freedom determining the antiferromagnetic quantum critical point ( qcp ) .",
    "after this procedure is performed one is left with low - energy fermions and a critical mode describing antiferromagnetic fluctuations near qcp .",
    "there are recent attempts to derive the sf model from , e.g. t - j model @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the general effective model derived in that work is still not sufficiently simple for explicit calculations .",
    "therefore , we prefer to use a simpler sf model that allows one analytical study in the metallic region near the qcp .    using this model",
    "one can come to such low energy phenomena as superconductivity@xcite , obtain a cdw instability@xcite , and study a competition between superconductivity and cdw using a @xmath28-model with a composite fluctuating order parameter efetov2013,mepe , empe .",
    "calculations based on the @xmath28-model show that there is a region of temperatures where only short range correlations of a mixture of superconducting and cdw orders exist and this region has been identified with the pseudogap state@xcite .",
    "all these results have been obtained assuming that important contributions come only from fermions with momenta close to the fermi surface . in this limit",
    "one could linearize the spectrum of the fermions , which is a standard procedure when performing calculations in the weak coupling limit .",
    "moreover , most important were only small parts of the fermi surface in the vicinity of so called hot spots .. it was assumed also that the coulomb interaction could only be important for determining parameters of the low energy effective sf model but it was not present explicitly there .    actually , these assumptions are not universally applicable when describing cuprates and we assume the following new features of the sf model .",
    "\\1 ) interaction effects are strong not only in the immediate vicinities of the hot spots but in the full antinodal region .",
    "quantitatively this means that the energies @xmath76 are smaller or of the same order as the interaction energy scale .",

    "[ figmu ] .    * *    in reality , the values of @xmath78 can be smaller than the pseudogap energy and are of order of several hundred kelvin bi2201arpes-1,bi2201arpes-2,bi2212arpes-1,bi2212arpes-2 . in this situation",
    ", one has to go beyond the vicinity of the fs where the spectrum can not be linearized .",
    "indeed , we will see that results concerning the charge order@xcite drastically change if the spectrum in the antinodal regions is treated more accurately .",

    "the results of the measurements of ref . show that the orientational transition preempts formation of cdw only at low dopings .",

    "it is thus possible that the c@xmath15-symmetry breaking at higher doping is not seen in the transport measurements due to a rather small difference between the densities of the domains with the two different orientations .",

    "we start with writing an operator destroying a hole on @xmath22 site @xmath164 with spin @xmath472 :    @xmath473    where @xmath474 is the creation operator of an electron on the site @xmath463 with spin @xmath28 .    in the single - band model",

    "if the site was occupied , however , the action of @xmath475 operator should be identically zero to avoid the double occupancy .",
    "therefore , one should take into account this restriction by projecting out states with site @xmath463 occupied .",
    "these arguments lead us to the following operator form of @xmath476 in the single - band representation :    @xmath477    where @xmath478    in order to exclude the double occupancy of an arbitrary site we use the gutzwiller projection operator @xmath479    the operator @xmath480 projects out states with the double electron occupancy , such that in the remaining wave function unoccupied states can occur only due to doping . to keep the wave function normalized we need to divide all the averages obtained by a factor @xmath481 .",
    "in what follows we will denote a normalized average of an operator @xmath482 over a gutzwiller projected state by @xmath483 .",

    "we have used the fact that the normal state is an eigenstate of the total particle number operator as well as the uniformity of the normal state .    now let us calculate the hole density on an oxygen site in the normal state :    @xmath485    as the system",

    "the unprojected mean - field state is characterized by a change of the expectation value of the bond operator @xmath488 in the ordered phase . to calculate corresponding change in the projected average @xmath489 we note that the operators @xmath490 transfer an electron from site @xmath463 to site @xmath491 .",
    "as the double - occupied sites are projected out , the site @xmath491 should be empty , while the site @xmath463 is occupied by an electron . assuming that these two conditions are uncorrelated we can reduce the influence of the projection to multiplication by projection factor @xmath492 for small doping .",
    "thus , one obtains @xmath493where @xmath494 is the contribution due to charge ordering in the corresponding average .",
    "now we rewrite @xmath495 in the momentum space @xmath496for the pure d - form factor @xmath497 only the nearest - neighbor correlation functions do not vanish . moreover , the contribution of non - nearest neighbor correlators to the hole density on the oxygen sites is suppressed because @xmath498 decreases rapidly for sites not adjacent to the oxygen site @xmath164 ( _ e.g. _",
