    "a precision measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic moment , @xmath2 , tests the standard model to the extent that both theory and experiment are well understood .",
    "the bnl e821 experiment has steadily increased the precision with which @xmath3 is known  @xcite .",
    "the result , published  @xcite in august 2002 dominates the new world average of @xmath4 ( 0.7  ppm ) .",
    "this includes the complete analysis of all of the positive muon data obtained to date by the e821 group . another ( somewhat smaller ) sample of negative muon data is presently being analyzed , and a final run to complete the experiment is planned .",
    "figure  [ fg : exp - results ] illustrates the progression of precision in the measurements of @xmath3 including the cern - iii  @xcite and present bnl results .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) expectation for @xmath5   is based on qed , the weak interaction , and hadronic loops .",
    "all must be computed at the sub - ppm level in order to be compared meaningfully with experiment . of these contributions ,",
    "both the qed and weak terms are believed to be known to sufficient precision  ( see czarnecki and marciano  @xcite ) , even withstanding a recent examination of eighth - order qed terms , which uncovered a negligible mistake  @xcite , and considerations of hadronic contributions to higher - order weak terms  @xcite .",
    "the need to consider such subtle contributions has reached increased importance because the bnl experimental precision is better than 1  ppm , additional data is being analyzed , and collaboration discussions have begun to consider an even more precise experiment , either at bnl or the jhf .",
    "many standard model extensions manifest themselves in additional contributions to @xmath3 at the ppm level , so the relevance of the current studies , in advance of the lhc direct - discovery potential , is quite important .",
    "this paper briefly summarizes the experiment , the analysis of the 2000 data , and the up - to - date theory ( _ i.e. _ , through nov .",
    "the reader is strongly encouraged to consult the original published papers where appropriate .",
    "the experiment measures directly @xmath6   and not @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is approximately @xmath9 .",
    "the muon anomaly is determined from the difference between the cyclotron and spin precession frequencies for muons contained in a magnetic storage ring , namely @xmath10 .",
    "\\label{eq : omega}\\ ] ] because electric quadrupoles are used to provide vertical focussing in the storage ring , the @xmath11 term is necessary and illustrates the sensitivity of the spin motion to a radial electric field .",
    "this term conveniently vanishes for the  magic \" momentum of 3.094  gev/@xmath12 when @xmath13 . the experiment is therefore built around the principle of production and storage of muons centered at this momentum in order to minimize the electric field effect . because of the finite momentum spread of the stored muons , a 0.3  ppm correction to the observed precession frequency is made to account for the muons above or below the magic momentum .",
    "vertical betatron oscillations induced by the focussing electric field imply that the plane of the muon precession has a time - dependent pitch .",
    "accounting for both of these electric - field related effects introduces a @xmath14  ppm correction to the precession frequency in the 2000 data .",
    "muons exhibit circular motion in the storage ring and their spins precess until the time of decay ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the net spin precession depends on the integrated magnetic field experienced along the path of the muon .",
    "parity violation leads to a preference for the highest - energy decay electrons ( in the muon rest frame ) to be emitted in the direction of the muon spin .",
    "therefore , a snapshot of the muon spin direction at time @xmath16 after injection into the storage ring is obtained , again on average , by the selection of decay electrons in the upper part of the lorentz - boosted michel spectrum ( @xmath17  gev ) .",
    "the number of electrons above a selected energy threshold is modulated at frequency @xmath18 with a threshold - dependent asymmetry @xmath19 .",
    "the decay electron distribution is described by @xmath20 , \\label{eq : fivepar}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 , the normalization , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are all dependent on the energy threshold @xmath24 . for @xmath25  gev , @xmath26 .",
    "in summary , the experiment involves the measurement of the time - averaged quantities @xmath18 and @xmath27 in eq .",
    "[ eq : omega ] . here",
    "@xmath27 implies the azimuthially - averaged magnetic field , folded with the muon distribution , the latter being determined from the debunching rate of the initial beam burst and from a tracking simulation .",
    "the field strength is measured using nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) in units of the free proton precession frequency , @xmath28 .",
    "the muon anomaly is computed from @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the measured  @xcite magnetic moment ratio @xmath31 .    just like in the analysis of our 1999 data , four independent teams evaluated @xmath18 and two studied @xmath32 . during the analysis period ,",
    "the @xmath18 and @xmath32 teams maintained separate , secret offsets to their measured frequencies .",
    "the offsets were removed and @xmath0 was computed only after all analyses were complete .",
    "the brookhaven muon storage ring  @xcite is a superferric",
    " c \"- shaped magnet , 7.11  m in radius , and open on the inside .",
    "three superconducting coils provide a central field of approximately 1.45  t. passive and active shimming elements have been improved and optimized since the inception of the experiment .",
    "the magnetic field is measured using pulsed nmr on protons in water- or vaseline - filled probes  @xcite .",
    "the proton precession frequency is proportional to the local field strength and is measured with respect to the same clock system employed in the determination of .",
    "the absolute field is , in turn , determined by comparison with a precision measurement of @xmath33 in a spherical water sample  @xcite to a relative precision of better than @xmath34 . a subset of the 360  fixed \" probes is used to continuously monitor the field during data taking .",
    "these probes are embedded in machined grooves in the outer upper and lower plates of the aluminum vacuum chamber and consequently measure the field just outside of the actual storage volume .",
    "constant field strength is maintained using 36 of the probes in a feedback loop with the main magnet power supply .",
    "the determination of the field inside the storage volume is made by use of a unique non - magnetic trolley which can travel in vacuum through the muon storage volume .",
    "the trolley carries 17 nmr probes on a grid appropriate to determine the local multipolarity of the field versus azimuth .",
    "trolley field maps are made every few days and take several hours to complete .",
    "figure  [ fg : field2000 ] shows the contours superimposed on a 9  cm diameter circle , which represents the storage aperature .",
    "a highly polarized ( @xmath35 ) muon sample is created from the decay of 3.15  gev/@xmath12 pions in a 72  m long decay channel .",
    "the last dipole in this channel is tuned to a momentum approximately 1.7  percent lower than the central pion momentum in order to enhance the muon fraction in the beam , compared to pions , at the entrance to the storage ring .",
    "the approximately 1:1 @xmath36 to @xmath37 mix passes through a superconducting inflector magnet  @xcite , which provides a field - free channel in the back of the ring s iron yoke .",
    "a set of three pulsed  kicker \" magnets  @xcite provides a 10  mrad transverse deflection to the muon bunch during the first two turns in the ring and thus places the muons on a central orbit at the magic momentum .",
    "electric quadrupoles  @xcite are initially charged asymmetrically to scrape the beam against internal collimaters . after approximately 20  @xmath37s",
    ", the voltages are symmetrized at @xmath3824  kv corresponding to a weak - focussing field index @xmath39 .",
    "coherent horizontal and vertical betatron oscillations ( cbo , i.e. , oscillations of the beam as a whole ) , manifest themselves as additional frequencies in the data that must be accommodated ( see below ) .",
    "the most important of these is the beating between the cyclotron and the horizontal betatron oscillations , determined as @xmath40  khz , where @xmath41 is the cyclotron frequency .",
    "note that @xmath42 is close to twice the precession frequency , @xmath43  khz , and thus , if ignored , will affect the extraction of @xmath44 .",
    "this issue was handled in the 1999 data analysis by accounting for the modulation of the overall rate of events at the horizontal cbo frequency .",
    "however , for 2000 , @xmath45 was adjusted slightly , placing @xmath42 closer to @xmath46 compared to 1999 .",
    "this effect , coupled with significantly higher statistics in 2000 , necessitated additional considerations .",
    "for example , not only was the overall event rate seen to be modulated , but also the asymmetry and even the phase .",
    "the four analyses approached this central problem differently .",
    "the electron detection system consists of 24 lead - scintillating fiber electromagnetic calorimeters  @xcite located symmetrically around the inside of the storage ring and placed immediately adjacent to the vacuum chamber .",
    "the 23  cm long , radially - oriented fiber grid terminates on four lightguides which pipe the light to independent hamamatsu r1828 2-inch pmts .",
    "the pmt gains are carefully balanced because the four analog signals are added prior to sampling by a dual - phase 400  mhz waveform digitizer .",
    "at least 16 digitized samples ( usually 24 or more ) , making `` islands , '' are recorded for each decay electron event exceeding a hardware threshold of approximately 1  gev .",
    "two examples of such samples are shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : pulses ] .",
    "the left panel illustrates a simple , single pulse .",
    "offline pulse - finding and fitting techniques are used to establish the electron energy and muon time of decay .",
    "two quasi - independent implementations of an algorithm to extract these quantities formed the basis of two raw - data processing efforts .",
    "the methods differ in particular for events which feature multi - pulse pileup , as shown on the right panel in the figure . here",
    ", two pulses are actually sufficiently well - separated that both pulse - finding algorithms can efficiently and accurately determine the correct energies and times ( verified by monte carlo simulations ) .",
    "the pulse - finding algorithms also identify the extra events on the tails of the recorded island of samples , which are then used to estimate the time - dependent pileup fraction .",
    "these `` shadow pulses '' are used to construct pileup - only event spectra , which can be subtracted ( on average ) from the data .",
    "this forms a `` pileup - free '' decay spectrum .",
    "alternatively , the pileup - only spectrum can be fit to determine the parameters necessary to describe the distortion to the uncorrected decay spectrum .",
    "the data set for 2000 consisted of approximately four billion electrons with an energy above 2.0  gev , recorded @xmath47s or more after muon injection . these data came from a common set of good runs that avoided known hardware failures , glitches or calibration periods .",
    "data obtained during systematic studies were also removed .",
    "the four independent analysis methods then treated the data quite differently after that .",
    "a fit to the data using the five - parameter function given in eq .",
    "[ eq : fivepar ] is poor owing to the cbo modulation mentioned above , the deviation from the pure exponential decay due to time - dependent muon losses , and slowly - varying effects such as detector gain or incomplete treatment of pileup .",
    "figure  [ fg : residuals ] is a fourier transform of the residuals from such a simple fit .",
    "it clearly illustrates the dominant horizontal cbo frequency and its sidebands at @xmath48 .",
    "note that @xmath49 has been removed in this representation because of the fit ( the frequency is indicated by the dashed line ) ; the small peak at @xmath50 is close to this dashed line and thus potentially interferes with the proper extraction of @xmath49 or , equivalently , @xmath44 .",
    "two analysis methods used independent implementations of an expanded conventional functional form applied to a pileup - free electron decay spectrum ( pileup events were corrected for as described above ) .",
    "the data were summed for all detectors , which has the effect of reducing the cbo - related amplitudes significantly compared to fits to individual detector spectra . to account for the modulation of the normalization _ and _ the asymmetry , @xmath51 and @xmath52 in eq .",
    "[ eq : fivepar ] .",
    "the phase was left constant , relying instead on the cancellation of its effect from summing all detectors .",
    "the residual effect was included in the systematic uncertainty associated with the overall treatment of cbo .",
    "a third analysis method started from a spectrum of the data where the exponential decay and other slowly - varying effects are absent , thus isolating the @xmath6 oscillation as only identifiable feature .",
    "events are sorted into four sets ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) , with sets @xmath22 and @xmath27 time shifted by plus or minus one half of a @xmath55 period , respectively , and sets @xmath56 and @xmath54 left unaffected .",
    "recombined in the ratio @xmath57 , this spectrum exhibits an oscillation about zero at frequency @xmath44 .",
    "it was then fit using a three - parameter function of the form @xmath58 .",
    "the fourth method divided the data into nine 0.2  gev wide energy bins for each of the 22 included detectors , resulting in 198 independent data sets .",
    "the lowest - energy bin was centered at 1.5  gev , which meant a significant amount of additional data was considered compared to those analyses described above .",
    "the lower - energy threshold also necessitated an extended pileup identification procedure to account for events below twice the hardware threshold .",
    "a pileup spectrum was built for each detector and energy bin and fit to extract the amplitude and phase .",
    "these parameters were then used in the fit function applied to the data , which was not corrected for pileup , contrary to the other methods . as in the first two methods ,",
    "a slowly - varying muon loss function was incorporated into the fit .",
    "finally the terms @xmath59 and @xmath23 in eq .",
    "[ eq : fivepar ] are permitted to oscillate with the cbo frequency as @xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the relative amplitude and phase of the modulation for @xmath59 and @xmath23 .",
    "the modulation of these parameters has a time - dependent envelope , which is determined both from independent studies and from the fit itself .",
    "each detector and energy bin was separately fit , with a start time determined from a @xmath63 stability test .",
    "figure  [ fg : finalresults ] illustrates the results on @xmath44 for the fourth method .",
    "it shows the fit results versus start time of the fit ( upper left ) , energy bin ( upper right ) , and detector station ( lower left ) .",
    "the distribution of the 198 individual results with respect to the average is shown in the bottom right panel .",
    "all plots show the expected statistical fluctuations .      summarizing the four methods above involved accounting precisely for data overlap , then combining to form a proper average .",
    "systematics were studied separately for each method .",
    "the final result for the 2000 precession frequency is @xmath64  hz ( 0.7  ppm ) where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic .",
    "combined with the field value , and weighing with earlier experimental results , the new result for the muon anomaly is @xmath65 .",
    "the sm prediction for @xmath5   has gone through several significant changes during the last year ; at present there is no single quotable number .",
    "the qed  @xcite and weak contributions  @xcite are not controversial at the level of relevance required here giving , respectively , @xmath3(qed)@xmath66 ( 0.025 ppm ) and @xmath3(weak)@xmath67 ( 0.03 ppm ) .",
    "the first - order hadronic vacuum polarization ( hvp ) contribution carries the largest uncertainty in the sm value .",
    "it has been updated in 2002 using new @xmath68 data from novosibirsk and beijing and additional hadronic tau decay data from lep and cleo .",
    "these data are used as input into the dispersion relation to compute @xmath3(hvp ) ; see ref .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite ( dehz ) recently released an updated evaluation , thus superseding their previous work and the compilations of others ( which were sometimes based on preliminary data ) .",
    "the most important finding in dehz is that the @xmath68 and tau - based analyses do not agree with one another .",
    "the @xmath68 evaluation was performed independently  @xcite confirming the result of dehz , but the difference with the tau - based analysis appears to be more fundamental .",
    "for example , the @xmath69 spectral functions are not consistent and the difference is shown to be energy dependent . because the tau input requires invoking cvc and isospin corrections , suspicion first fell to it .",
    "these corrections are relatively small  @xcite , and even expanding the uncertainty considerably would not put these data into agreement with the @xmath68-based result .",
    "meanwhile , the first reports on a third method to determine hvp using the `` radiative return '' method have been presented  @xcite .",
    "fixed center - of - mass energy @xmath68 collisions are scanned for events having an initial - state radiated photon , thus lowering the effective collision energy . at one accelerator setting",
    ", the entire spectral function can be obtained .",
    "the reports are preliminary and use only a fraction of the data",
    ". however , the procedure looks promising and should be able to confirm or refute the @xmath68 novosibirsk result .",
    "for now , dehz quote @xmath3(hvp,@xmath68)@xmath70 or @xmath3(hvp , tau)@xmath71 , both @xmath72 with comparable relative precisions of @xmath73 ppm .",
    "because the dispersion relation is weighed heavily toward low energies , the true underlying difference in the input data exceeds the relative difference implied to @xmath5 .",
    "one should not be tempted to take an average or to ascribe the problem to statistical fluctuations .",
    "higher - order hadronic contributions  @xcite give @xmath3(h - h.o.)@xmath74 . the hadronic light - by - light contribution changed by @xmath75 following knecht and nyffeler s demonstration  @xcite that this contribution must be positive , contrary to the existing literature  @xcite by others . eventually mistakes in earlier work",
    "were found  @xcite and agreement exists on the sign ( with confidence ) , the magnitude ( essentially ) , but not necessarily the uncertainty ( see , for example , ref .",
    "a middle - ground value with a conservative uncertainty is @xmath3(h - lbl )  @xmath76 .    summarizing the above",
    ", we obtain the standard model theory to date : @xmath77 @xmath78    compared to the experiment there is either a 3.0 ( @xmath68 ) or a 1.6 ( tau ) standard deviation difference , respectively , leading one to begin to draw very different conclusions ( see fig .",
    "[ fg : finalcomparison ] ) .    the next year for @xmath6 might turn out to be as interesting as the past year : a final data set will be analyzed from negative muons ; new input from kloe and possibly babar should resolve the hvp problem ; and , finally",
    ", we hope to obtain the funds to complete the experiment at bnl and reach the systematic limit of the experiment .",
    "perhaps at that time , we can more meaningfully explore the implications for physics beyond the standard model . at present , the story is clearly still unfolding .",
