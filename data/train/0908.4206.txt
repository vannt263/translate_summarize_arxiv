    "complex networks are a powerful and versatile mathematical tool for representing and modeling structure of complex systems  @xcite , and their wide applications in different areas have made them become a subject of a large volume of research in the past decade  @xcite . within the general framework of complex networks , scientists can offer in qualitative terms the detailed microscopic description of structural properties and complexity of real - life systems .",
    "extensive empirical analysis on diverse real systems has unveiled that many , perhaps most , real - world networks are simultaneously characterized by the two most remarkable features : scale - free behavior  @xcite and modular organization  @xcite .",
    "the scale - free nature of a network means that its degree distribution @xmath0 follows a power law as @xmath1 with the degree distribution exponent in the range of @xmath2 , while the modular organization implies that the network is formed by groups ( modules ) of nodes that have a significantly higher interconnection density compared to the overall density of the whole network .",
    "the important finding of these two fundamental natures has led to the rising of research on some outstanding issues in the field of complex networks such as exploring the generation mechanisms for scale - free behavior  @xcite , detecting and characterizing modular structure  @xcite , and so on . on the other hand , it has been shown that the two characteristics are closely related to other structural properties such as average path length  @xcite and clustering coefficient  @xcite .    in principle , one of the main reasons for studying structural properties of complex networks is to understand how the dynamical processes are influenced by the underlying topological structure  @xcite . among a plethora of random processes ,",
    "random walks with wide range of distinct applications to many science branches , have attracted a considerable amount of recent attention within the physics community  @xcite .",
    "particularly , trapping issue , an integral major theme of random walks , is relevant to a variety of contexts , including target research  @xcite , photon - harvesting processes in photosynthetic cells  @xcite , and characterizing similarities between the elements of a database  @xcite has led to an increasing number of theoretical and practical investigations over the last several decades .",
    "numerous authors have made concerted efforts to study trapping problem in different media , including regular lattices  @xcite , sierpinski fractals  @xcite , _ t _ fractal  @xcite , small - world networks  @xcite , and scale - free networks  @xcite , as well as other structures  @xcite .",
    "these studies unclosed many unusual and exotic phenomena of trapping on diverse graphs .",
    "however , the trapping process on scale - free networks with modular structure remains less understood , in spite of the facts that modularity plays an important role in shaping up scale - free networks  @xcite , and that taking into account the modular structure of scale - free networks leads to a better understanding of how the underlying systems work  @xcite .    in this paper , we study the classic trapping problem on a class of hierarchical networks  @xcite , which is a random walk problem with a single immobile trap positioned at a given site , absorbing all walks visiting it . here",
    "we focus on a particular case with the trap located at the node with the highest degree .",
    "the networks studied can capture simultaneously scale - free behavior and modular structure . moreover , the networks belong to a deterministic growing type of networks , which have received much attention from the scientific communities and have proved to be a useful tool  @xcite .",
    "the deterministic nature of the hierarchical networks makes it possible to investigate analytically the trapping process defined on them . by applying the formalism  @xcite of generating functions  @xcite for random walks ,",
    "we derive the rigorous solution to the mean first - passage time ( mfpt ) that characterizes the trapping process .",
    "the obtained exact result shows that the mfpt scales algebraically with the number of network nodes .",
    "we also compare the behavior of the trapping problem on the hierarchical networks with those of other networks , and show that the hierarchical networks can be helpful for enhancing the efficiency of the trapping process .",
    "let us introduce the model for the hierarchical scale - free networks with a modular structure , which can be constructed in an iterative way  @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath3 the network model after @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) iterations ( number of generations ) .",
    "initially ( @xmath6 ) , the network consists of a central node , called the hub ( root ) node , and @xmath7 peripheral ( external ) nodes with @xmath8 .",
    "all these initial @xmath9 nodes are fully connected to each other , forming a complete graph . at the second generation ( @xmath10 )",
    ", we generate @xmath7 copies of @xmath11 and connect the @xmath7 external nodes of each replica to the root of the original @xmath11 .",
    "the hub of the original @xmath11 and the @xmath12 peripheral nodes in the replicas become the hub and peripheral nodes of @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "suppose one has @xmath14 , the next generation network @xmath3 can be obtained from @xmath14 by adding @xmath7 replicas of @xmath14 with their external nodes being linked to the hub of the original @xmath14 unit . in @xmath3 ,",
    "its hub is the hub of the original @xmath14 , and its external nodes are composed of all the peripheral nodes of the @xmath7 copies of @xmath14 . repeating indefinitely the replication and connection steps , we obtain the hierarchical modular scale - free networks .",
    "figure  [ network ] illustrates the construction process of a network for the particular case of @xmath15 , showing the first three iterations .     the iterative construction process of a hierarchical network for the case of @xmath15 .",
    "notice that the diagonal nodes are also connected  links not visible . ]    according to the network construction , one can see that @xmath3 , the network of @xmath4th generation , is characterized by two parameters @xmath4 and @xmath9 , with the former being the number of generations , and the latter representing the replication factor . in @xmath3 , the number of nodes , often called order of the network denoted as @xmath16 , is @xmath17 .",
    "all these nodes can be classified into the following four sets  @xcite : peripheral node set @xmath18 , locally peripheral node set @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , set @xmath21 only consisting of the hub node of @xmath3 , and the local hub set @xmath22 ( @xmath20 ) ; see fig .",
    "[ class ] .",
    "the cardinalities , defined as the number of nodes in a set , of the four sets are latexmath:[\\[\\label{car_k_p }         @xmath3 , all nodes belonging to the same set have identical connectivity ( i.e. , degree ) , which are known exactly .",
    "for example , the degree @xmath24 of the hub node is the largest ; it has a value of @xmath25\\,.\\ ] ] any node in @xmath18 has the degree @xmath26 again , for instance , the degree of a node in @xmath19 is @xmath27 and an arbitrary node in @xmath22 has a degree of @xmath28.\\ ] ] thus , the sum of degrees for all nodes in @xmath29 is @xmath30 and the mean degree averaged over all nodes is @xmath31,\\ ] ] which is approximately equal to @xmath32 in the limit of infinite @xmath4 .     for the case of @xmath33 . the filled circles , open circles , full square , and triangles represent peripheral nodes , locally peripheral nodes , hub node , and locally hub nodes , respectively . ]",
    "the hierarchical networks present some typical properties of real systems in nature and society  @xcite .",
    "they are scale free with the degree distribution exponent @xmath34 .",
    "the average path length , defined as the shortest distance averaged over all pairs of nodes , scales logarithmically with the number of nodes . in the large network order limit",
    ", the average clustering coefficient tends to a large constant dependent on @xmath9 .",
    "thus , the whole family of networks exhibits small - world behavior  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the betweenness of nodes in the networks follows the same power - law distribution @xmath35 irrespective of @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , the networks show an obvious modular structure .",
    "all these characteristics are not shared by other models .",
    "the peculiar topological features make the networks unique within the category of scale - free networks ; it therefore is worthwhile to investigate various dynamical processes running on them . in what follows we will study the trapping problem on this class of modular networks to uncover the influence of the particular topologies on the trapping process",
    "in this section we formulate the trapping problem on the family of hierarchical scale - free networks @xmath29 , which is actually a simple unbiased markovian random walk of a particle in the presence of a trap or a perfect absorber located on a given node . to facilitate the description , we distinguish different nodes in @xmath29 by assigning each of them a labeling in the following way .",
    "the hub node in @xmath29 has label 1 ; the other @xmath7 peripheral nodes in @xmath36 are labeled as 2 , 3 , and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "assume that we have labeled nodes in @xmath14 consecutively by 1 , 2 , and @xmath37 ; in the next generation @xmath4 , we keep the labels of nodes in the original @xmath14 unchanged and label only the nodes belonging to the @xmath7 copies of @xmath14 by assigning to each node a different integer from @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",
    "in this way , every node in @xmath29 is labeled by a unique integer from 1 to @xmath17 ; see fig .",
    "[ labeling ] .",
    "labels of all nodes in @xmath40 for the case of @xmath15 corresponding to the @xmath41 case in fig .",
    "[ network ] . ]    for convenience , we continue to represent @xmath29 by its adjacency matrix @xmath42 of order @xmath43 , whose @xmath44 element @xmath45 is defined as follows : @xmath46 if @xmath47 and @xmath48 are neighboring nodes and @xmath49 otherwise .",
    "then the degree , @xmath50 , of node @xmath47 is given by @xmath51 , the diagonal degree matrix @xmath52 of @xmath29 is @xmath53 , and the normalized laplacian matrix of @xmath29 is provided by @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the @xmath43 identity matrix .    before proceeding further ,",
    "let us introduce the so - called discrete - time random walk on @xmath29 .",
    "at each time step , the particle jumps from its current location to any of its nearest neighbors with equal probability .",
    "according to this rule , at time @xmath56 , a particle located at a node @xmath47 will hop to one of its @xmath57 neighbors , say @xmath58 , with the transition probability @xmath59 .",
    "suppose that the particle starts off from node @xmath47 at @xmath60 , then the jumping probability @xmath61 of going from @xmath47 to @xmath48 at time @xmath56 is governed by the following master equation  @xcite : @xmath62    we next focus the trapping problem on @xmath29 with the trap fixed on the hub node , i.e. , node 1 , represented as @xmath63 .",
    "the particular choice for the trap position allows to compute analytically the mfpt , which will be discussed in detail in the following section .",
    "similar to the standard discrete - time random walks , during the trapping process , in a single time step , the particle , starting from any node except the trap @xmath63 , jumps to any of its nearest neighbors with the same probability .",
    "what we are concerned with is the expected time that the particle spends , starting from a source node before being trapped , which is in fact a random variable .",
    "let @xmath64 be the expected time , frequently called first - passage time ( fpt ) or trapping time , for a walker , starting from node @xmath47 , to first arrive at the trap @xmath63 . in order to determine @xmath64 , we define @xmath65 to be the probability for the particle , starting from point @xmath47 , to first hit the trap after @xmath56 steps .",
    "notice that since the markov chain  @xcite representing such a random walk is ergodic , the particle will be eventually trapped independently of the origin , implying that @xmath66 holds for all @xmath47 .",
    "it is easily known that the set of these interesting quantities obeys the following recurrence relation : @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
    "let @xmath69 be the corresponding generating function of quantity @xmath65 : @xmath70 which encapsulates all the information contained in the discrete probability distribution @xmath71 .",
    "for example , the expected value @xmath64 is the first derivative of @xmath69 evaluated at @xmath72 .",
    "let @xmath73 stand for the @xmath74-dimensional vector @xmath75^{\\top}$ ] , where the superscript @xmath76 represents the transpose of the vector . according to eqs .",
    "( [ mfpt01 ] ) and  ( [ genf01 ] ) , we have @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a matrix with order @xmath79 with entry @xmath80 .",
    "differentiating the two sides of eq .",
    "( [ genf02 ] ) with respect to @xmath81 and doing some simple algebra operations , we have @xmath82 in which @xmath83 is the identity matrix with order @xmath84 ; @xmath85 is the @xmath74-dimensional zero vector @xmath86 . setting @xmath72 in eq .",
    "( [ genf03 ] ) leads to @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the @xmath74-dimensional unit vector .",
    "actually , @xmath89 in eq .",
    "( [ mfpt02 ] ) is the fundamental matrix of the markov chain representing the unbiased random walk , and @xmath90 is a submatrix of the normalized discrete laplacian matrix @xmath91 of @xmath29 , which is obtained from @xmath91 by removing from @xmath91 the first row and column corresponding to the trap .    from eq .",
    "( [ mfpt02 ] ) , the mean first - passage time , @xmath92 , which is the average of @xmath64 over all initial nodes distributed uniformly over nodes in @xmath29 other than the trap , is given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the corresponding @xmath44 element of matrix @xmath89 , which is the mean time that the particle spends at node @xmath47 starting from node @xmath48  @xcite .",
    "equation  ( [ mfpt03 ] ) shows that the problem of calculating mfpt @xmath95 is reduced to finding the sum of all elements of matrix @xmath89 . since the order of @xmath96 is @xmath79 , where @xmath16 increases exponentially with @xmath4 , for large @xmath4 , inverting matrix @xmath96 is prohibitively time and memory consuming , making it intractable to obtain @xmath95 through direct calculation from eq .",
    "( [ mfpt03 ] ) ; one can compute directly the mfpt only for the first several generations ( see fig .  [ time ] ) .",
    "hence , an alternative method of computing mfpt becomes necessary . in  @xcite , to allow for a drastic reduction in computational cost , a scheme was proposed mapping the original markov process on another markov process .",
    "although the method can bring down the computational efforts , it is an approximate one .",
    "fortunately , the special recursive construction of the hierarchical networks allows to calculate analytically mfpt to obtain an explicit solution for arbitrary generation @xmath4 .",
    "in the next section , we will provide the detailed process for the derivation of mfpt using a method significantly different from that applied in  @xcite .",
    "( color online ) mean first - passage time @xmath95 as a function of the iteration @xmath4 on a semilogarithmic scale for two cases of @xmath97 and @xmath33 .",
    "the filled symbols are the data coming from genuine simulations of the trapping process ; the empty squares and circles represent the numerical results obtained by direct calculation from eq .",
    "( [ mfpt03 ] ) ; while the empty pentagons and hexagons correspond to the exact values given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : mfpt09 ] ) . ]",
    "prior to deriving the general formula for mfpt , @xmath92 , for the trapping issue on @xmath29 , we first define some related quantities .",
    "let @xmath98 denote the probability that , at the generation @xmath4 , the particle starting from any peripheral node in @xmath18 first arrives at the hub after @xmath56 jumps ; and let @xmath99 represent the probability that , the walker originating from the hub to first reach any node belonging to @xmath18 after @xmath56 steps .",
    "then , the following fundamental relations can be established : @xmath100 and @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the kronecker delta function that is defined as follows : @xmath103 if @xmath56 is equal to 1 , and @xmath104 otherwise .",
    "note that in eqs .",
    "( [ mtt01 ] ) and  ( [ mtt02 ] ) , the equivalence of nodes in the same set ( e.g. , @xmath18 or @xmath19 ) was used .",
    "the three terms on the right - hand side ( rhs ) of eq .",
    "( [ mtt01 ] ) can be elaborated as follows : the first term accounts for the probability that the walker takes only one time step to first reach the hub ; the second term on the rhs explains the case that the particle gets first to one of its @xmath105 neighbors belonging to @xmath18 in one time step , and then it takes more @xmath106 steps to first arrive at the target node ; the last term on the rhs describes the probability of the process in which the walker first makes a jump to a local hub node belonging to @xmath19 , then it takes @xmath47 time steps , starting from the local hub , to hit one of the nodes in @xmath18 , and continues to jump more @xmath107 steps to first reach the hub .",
    "analogously , the two terms on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ mtt02 ] ) can be understood based on the following two processes .",
    "the first term explains the occurring probability of the process that the walker , starting from the hub , only needs one time step to reach a peripheral node in @xmath18 .",
    "the second term represents the happening probability of such a process that the particle , originating from the hub , first makes one jump to a local peripheral node in @xmath19 , then makes @xmath47 jumps to the hub , and proceeds to the destination ( one of the nodes in @xmath18 ) , taking more @xmath107 time steps .",
    "equations  ( [ mtt01 ] ) and  ( [ mtt02 ] ) provide the two basic relations governing the trapping problem performing on @xmath29 , from which almost all subsequent results are derived from . as shown in the preceding section , although we are concerned about only the fundamental quantity ( namely , mfpt ) , the direct calculations are practically hard and intractable for large networks .",
    "nevertheless , the particular construction of the networks allows to overcome this difficulty in virtue of the powerful mathematical technique of generating functions  @xcite , through which we can compute and determine the mfpt @xmath108 indirectly .",
    "first , we define two generating functions , @xmath109 and @xmath110 , for the probability distribution of first - passage time described in eqs .",
    "( [ mtt01 ] ) and  ( [ mtt02 ] ) , which can be written as @xmath111 and @xmath112 after some algebraic operations , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : genp ] ) and  ( [ eq : genq ] ) can be recast , respectively , as @xmath113=1\\ ] ] and @xmath114=1.\\ ] ]    let @xmath115 denote the first - passage time for a walker starting from an arbitrary node in @xmath18 to reach the hub for the first time , which is in fact the number of steps for the walker originating from any node in @xmath18 to first visit the hub .",
    "let @xmath116 stand for the fpt needed for a particle initially located at the hub to first hit any node in @xmath18 . then , according to the property of generating functions , the two quantities @xmath115 and @xmath116 are given separately by @xmath117 and @xmath118    differentiating , respectively , both sides of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : genp1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : genq1 ] ) with respect to @xmath119 and setting @xmath120 , we obtain the following two coupled relations : @xmath121 and @xmath122 from the above two coupled equations , it is not difficult to have @xmath123 and @xmath124 considering the initial conditions @xmath125 and @xmath126 , we can solve the simultaneous equations , i.e. , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mptp2 ] ) and  ( [ eq : mptpq2 ] ) , to obtain @xmath127 and @xmath128    the obtained expressions for @xmath115 and @xmath116 are very important , using which we will determine mfpt @xmath95 . to facilitate the computation , we use @xmath129 to represent the set of nodes in @xmath29 and separate them into two subsets :",
    "one subset is @xmath130 made up of nodes in the original @xmath14 , and the other subset , denoted by @xmath131 , is the set of nodes of the @xmath7 copies of @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath132 denote the trapping time for a walker originating at node @xmath47 on the @xmath4th generation network to first reach the trap node ( hub ) . obviously , for all @xmath133 , @xmath134 . for @xmath135",
    ", it is a trivial case , we have @xmath136 .",
    "then , by definition , the mfpt @xmath95 can be expressed as @xmath137 where the sum term @xmath138 can be rewritten as @xmath139 which is obvious from the particular construction of the hierarchical networks .",

    "( [ eq : mfpt06 ] ) , we can obtain the following recurrence relation for @xmath142 : @xmath143.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the initial condition @xmath144 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mfpt09 ] ) is solved inductively to obtain the rigorous expression for the mfpt : @xmath145.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we have checked our analytic formula against numerical values obtained according to the fundamental matrix provided by eq .",
    "( [ mfpt03 ] ) . for different parameters @xmath9 and @xmath4 ,",
    "the values obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mfpt10 ] ) completely agree with those numerical results on the basis of the direct calculation through eq .",
    "( [ mfpt03 ] ) ; see fig .",
    "this agreement serves as an independent test of our theoretical formula .",
    "moreover , we have performed genuine simulations of the random walk process on the hierarchical networks .",
    "the data from the true process are shown in fig .",
    "[ time ] , each of which is obtained by averaging over @xmath146 realizations .",
    "the results of the true simulations are in excellent agreement with our analytical ones given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : mfpt10 ] ) , and thus provide an important further evidence in favor of our findings .",
    "we continue to show how to represent mfpt in terms of network order @xmath16 with the aim to obtain the scaling between these two quantities . recalling @xmath147",
    ", we have @xmath148 .",
    "hence , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mfpt10 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath149.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , for networks with large order , i.e. , @xmath150 , @xmath151 where the exponent @xmath152 is lower than 1 .",
    "clearly , @xmath152 is a decreasing function of @xmath9 : when @xmath9 grows from 3 to infinite , @xmath152 descends from @xmath153 and approaches to zero , which means that the efficiency of the trapping process depends on @xmath9 .",
    "the larger the value of @xmath9 , the more efficient the trapping process . equation  ( [ mfpt21 ] ) also implies that in the infinite network order @xmath16 limit , the mfpt grows algebraically with increasing order of the networks .",
    "the above obtained scaling of mfpt with order of the hierarchical scale - free networks is quite different from those scalings for other media .",
    "for instance , on regular lattices with large order @xmath154 , the asymptotical behavior of mfpt @xmath155 is @xmath156 , @xmath157 , and @xmath158 for dimensions @xmath159 , @xmath160 , and @xmath161 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "again for example , on planar sierpinski gasket  @xcite and sierpinski tower  @xcite in three euclidean dimensions , and the @xmath162 fractal  @xcite , the mfpt @xmath155 scales superlinearly with network order ; i.e. , it grows as a power - law function of network order with the exponents being 1.464 , 1.293 , and 1.631 , respectively .",
    "finally , for the pseudofractal web  @xcite , the koch network  @xcite , and the apollonian network  @xcite , they are all scale free , their mfpt scales linearly or sublinearly with network order , following separately the asymptotical behaviors @xmath163 , @xmath164 , and @xmath165 .",
    "thus , compared with the aforementioned regular networks , fractals , even scale - free networks , the addressed hierarchical networks exhibit more efficient configuration for random walks with a single trap fixed at the node with highest degree .",
    "the root of the high efficiency of the trapping problem on the hierarchical scale - free networks lies in their architecture . in this network family",
    ", there are many small densely interconnected clusters , which combine to form larger but less compact groups connected by nodes with high degrees ( i.e. , local hub nodes ) .",
    "the relatively large groups are further joined to shape even larger and even less densely interlinked modules . these modules or groups",
    "are combined again at a `` large '' node forming a fine hierarchical structure that is responsible for the fast diffusion phenomenon , which can be understood from the following heuristic argument .",
    "when a walker starts off from some node , it will either hit the hub directly or first get to local hub nodes .",
    "these local hubs , although not connected to the trap node , play the role of bridges linking different modules together at the local peripheral nodes , through which the walker may easily find the way to the trap .",
    "thus , the walker can visit the trap in a short time , disregarding its starting points .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the classic trapping problem on a class of hierarchical networks that can bring under a single roof the scale - free and modular topologies , which are two striking structural properties observed in various biological and social networks .",
    "thus , the hierarchical networks can mimic some real - world natural and social systems to some extent ( to what extent it does is still an open question ) . using the method of generating functions , we derived the recursion relations governing the evolution of the mfpt for random walks on the networks , with the only trap located at the hub node .",
    "these recursive relations are obtained from the special construction of the networks , from which we determined explicitly the solution for the mfpt , which shows that the mfpt @xmath166 varies algebraically with network order @xmath16 as @xmath167 with the exponent @xmath152 much less than 1 that decreases from @xmath168 to zero when @xmath9 increases from 3 to infinite .",
    "thus , in the full range of @xmath9 , the efficiency of the trapping process on the hierarchical networks is high .",
    "we have also compared the result with those previously obtained for other media , and found that in marked contrast to other graphs , the hierarchical networks have more efficient structure that tends to speed up the diffusion process .",
    "finally , it deserves to be mentioned that although the hierarchical networks are efficient for the trapping problem with the trap fixed on the hub , they might lose this characteristic when the trap is positioned at a randomly selected node , due to the somewhat tree - like macro - structure of this kind of networks  @xcite .",

    "<S> we demonstrate that the hierarchical networks under consideration have more efficient structure for transport by diffusion in contrast with other analytically soluble media including some previously studied scale - free networks . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the scale - free and modular topologies are responsible for the high efficiency of the trapping process on the hierarchical networks . </S>"
