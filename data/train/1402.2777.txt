    "it was shown how a slight modification to each of the two methods , which accounts for their discrepancy and amends their problems , makes them compatible with the presented truncation method . moreover , the new result turned out to be in agreement with a prediction made by los  @xcite .    in the present paper we concentrate on the dynamic response properties of the polaron system @xmath0   , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 represents the particle which is coupled to some bosonic field @xmath2 in a isotropic translational invariant way , i.e. @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",

    "@xcite we wish to derive an equation of motion for the current density under the assumption that the bosonic field @xmath2 was initially in thermal equilibrium .",
    "it follows from definition ( [ eq : generic : definesigma ] ) and from the relevant equations ( 2.5 - 2.7 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite that the current density satisfies@xmath8{c}n_{b}(\\omega_{k})\\sin \\left [   \\left (   \\frac{\\mathbf{\\hbar \\mathbf{k}}^{2}}{2m}-\\omega_{k}\\right )   ( t - t^{\\prime})\\right ]",

    "it thus seems reasonable to expand the sine function . truncating the expansion up to first order results in@xmath11 where we have adopted the notation of @xcite , such that memory function @xmath12 of the system is given by @xmath13{c}n_{b}(\\omega_{k})\\sin \\left (   \\left [   \\frac{\\hbar \\mathbf{k}^{2}}{2m}-\\omega _ { k}\\right ]   t\\right )",

( [ eq : generic : definesigma ] ) , the laplace transform @xmath16 of the conductivity satisfies@xmath17 a more accurate conductivity can be found using a resummation argument similar to that in  @xcite , which yields@xmath18 the resummation approximately takes into account that the proper polarizability @xmath14 depends on the response @xmath19 of the system itself .",
    "of course at very small coupling it would not matter .",
    "it ought to be clear that expression ( [ eq : conductivitylaplace ] ) for the conductivity reduces to expression ( 3.4 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite under the condition that @xmath20 consequently , for every finite @xmath21 the dc - conductivity is equal to the dc - conductivity discussed in @xcite .",
    "corrections to the mobility due to dynamical screening are thus of second order .",

    "in fact the relative change in the mass is only half of the change without dynamical screening .",
    "it should be noted that effective mass is a dynamical quantity and it depends on the entire spectral function through the polaron - f - sum rule  @xcite by devreese _",

    "their result is perturbative in @xmath45 and thus becomes exact for @xmath46 for @xmath41 their result is indistinguishable from the present result , which implies the present truncation scheme correctly predicts the weak coupling optical absorption . for @xmath42",

    "moreover , the present result is remarkably close to the nonperturbative method presented in ref .",

    "et al_.  @xcite , employs the impedance function approximation of fhip  @xcite .",
    "the method is thus nonperturbative in the sense that no expansion in the coupling constant is assumed .",
    "in conclusion we have presented the first order self - energy correction to the linear response coefficients of polaronic systems within the truncated phase space approach developed by the present authors in @xcite .",
    "it is shown how the change of the self - energy due to the external perturbation induces an internal field .",
    "the first order correction thus comes in terms of a dynamic polarizability @xmath48 it is shown that the relative change in the effective mass is only half of the change without dynamical screening .",

    "explicit expressions for the conductivity of the frhlich polaron are obtained .",
