    "quantum mechanical spreading of a particle hopping on a tight binding lattice is known to be suppressed by the application of an external force , which leads to periodic wave packet reconstruction @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of quantum diffusion suppression and periodic wave packet relocalization induced by an ac force was originally predicted in a seminal paper by dunlap and kenkre @xcite , and since then it is referred to as dynamic localization ( dl ) .",
    "this kind of localization is conceptually very different from other forms of localization , like anderson localization or localization in the periodically kicked quantum rotator problem , and arises from a collapse of the quasi energy spectrum at certain magic driving amplitudes @xcite .",
    "dl was observed in different physical systems , including electronic transport in semiconductor superlattices @xcite , cold atoms and bose - einstein condensates in optical lattices @xcite and optical beams in curved waveguide arrays @xcite .",
    "several works have extended the theory of dl to different physical conditions , for example to account for disorder @xcite , non - nearest neighbor hopping @xcite , particle interaction @xcite , and to non - hermitian lattices @xcite .",
    "lattice truncation is generally believed to be detrimental for perfect wave packet reconstruction .",
    "indeed , quasi - energy level collapse becomes only approximate for lattices with a finite number of sites @xcite . in this case , even in the absence of the external ac field , approximate reconstruction should occur at long enough times according to the very general quantum recurrence theorem @xcite , which is an extension to a quantum system with a discrete energy ( or quasi energy ) spectrum of the celebrated pioncar recurrence theorem of classical mechanics @xcite .",
    "+ in this work we present an exactly - solvable ac - driven lattice model with a finite number of lattice sites in which perfect wave packet reconstruction can occur at a frequency which is _ fractional _ than the driving frequency , a phenomenon that we refer to as _ fractional _ dl .",
    "as opposed to ordinary dl , fractional dl corresponds to a set of partial quasi - energy collapses and can occur at almost every amplitude of the driving force .",
    "fractional dl can be viewed as the realization of _ exact _ quantum recurrence in a system with a discrete quasi - energy spectrum at finite times which are integer multiplies than the forcing oscillation period .",
    "the lattice model that we consider is the krawtchouk quantum chain @xcite , which has been extensively investigated in several physical fields @xcite for its property of realizing perfect quantum state transfer and mirror inversion in the undriven case @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.2",
    "we briefly introduce the ac - driven krawtchouk quantum chain and show its equivalence with the ac - driven double - well model for non - interacting bosons ( ac - driven bosonic junction ) .",
    "a closed - form expressions of the quantum propagator and quasi energy spectrum are derived in sec.3 , where the phenomena of quantum recurrence , fractional dl and mirror inversion are discussed .",

    "the vertical arrows in the figure highlight partial collapse of quasi energy levels ( fractional dl ) at four values of @xmath11 ( from left to right ) : 0.496 , 0.84 , 1.3172 and 1.5476 .",

    "time is normalized to the period @xmath19 of the external force .",

    "i.e. for @xmath38 , the properties of the krawtchouk quantum chain are well known and have been extensively investigated , especially in the context of coherent quantum transport for its capability of realizing perfect quantum state transfer and mirror inversion @xcite . at @xmath39 , the energies of @xmath40 are equally - spaced and given by @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) , whereas the corresponding eigenfunctions are expressed in terms of the krawtchouk polynomials @xcite .",
    "equal energy spacing provides exact periodic wave packet reconstruction with periodicity @xmath43 , whereas mirror inversion occurs at the time @xmath44 .",
    "an interesting property of the krawtchouk quantum chain is that perfect wave packet reconstruction persists when a dc force is applied to the particle : in this case the particle undergoes periodic bloch oscillations on the inhomogeneous lattice @xcite . here",
    "we wish to study the krawtchouk quantum chain for a general time - dependent force @xmath2 , and in particular for ac forcing . to this aim ,",
    "it is worth establishing a correspondence between the hopping motion of a forced quantum particle on the krawtchouk chain , expressed by eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) , and the dynamics in fock space of @xmath23 non - interacting bosons trapped in a driven double - well potential , the so - called driven bosonic junction ; see fig.1(a ) .",

    "the equivalence between the bosonic junction model , defined by the second - quantization hamiltonian ( 4 ) , and the single - particle ac - driven krawtchouk quantum chain , defined by eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) , can be readily proven by looking at the dynamics of the bosonic field in fock space with constant particle number @xmath60 @xcite .",

    ". in particular , for a periodic ac driving force with frequency @xmath77 [ i.e. @xmath78 , floquet theory applies and the quasi energy spectrum of the ac - driven krawtchouk quantum chain can be obtained from the floquet exponents of the propagator @xmath79 at time @xmath80 .",
    "much of the propagation properties of the ac - driven krawtchouk quantum chain are determined by the properties of the two - level system eqs.(5 ) and ( 6 ) .",

    "hence the following properties hold rather generally : + ( i ) if @xmath87 , perfect wave packet reconstruction is observed at times @xmath88 and exact quasi energy band collapse is attained .",
    "this regime basically corresponds to the ordinary dl regime @xcite , where periodic wave packet reconstruction occurs at integer multiplies of the driving period @xmath89 .",
    "note that the condition @xmath87 corresponds to the coherent destruction of tunneling ( cdt ) for the two - level system of eqs.(15 - 17 ) , i.e. for the double well of fig.1(a ) @xcite .",
    "hence the ac - driven krawtchouk quantum chain provides a rather exceptional example of inhomogeneous chain where multilevel cdt can be realized in an exact way @xcite .",

    "undergo @xmath20 partial collapses at values which are integer multiplies than @xmath94 .",
    "it should be noted that , since the quasi energy @xmath81 is a continuous function of the amplitude of the driving force , it follows that fractional dl localization occurs for _ almost every value _ of the driving amplitude . in the framework of the general theory of quantum recurrence in hamiltonian systems with a discrete energy spectrum @xcite",

    "we apply the general theory discussed in the previous section to the case of a sinusoidal driving force @xmath105 and assume , without loss of generality , @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the quasi energies @xmath106 of the associated two - level system [ eqs.(5 - 7 ) ] versus the normalized forcing amplitude @xmath5 have to be computed in the general case only numerically ; in the large frequency limit @xmath107 they are approximated by the simple relation @xcite @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the bessel function of first kind and zero order . as an example , in fig.1(b ) we show the numerically - computed quasi energies versus @xmath11 of the two - level system for @xmath7 .",

    "_ full _ collapse of the @xmath9 quasi energies is clearly observed , corresponding to the ordinary dl regime .",
    "however , a _ partial _",
    "collapse of quasi energies can be clearly observed at many values of the normalized driving amplitude , according to the general analysis presented in the previous section .",
    "for example , in fig.2 the vertical arrows highlight partial quasi energy collapses occurring at four values of @xmath11 , namely at @xmath112 and @xmath113 , corresponding to @xmath114 and 4 partial collapses , respectively .",
    "note that , at such values of the normalized forcing amplitude , the ratio @xmath95 is a rational number , namely one has @xmath115 and @xmath116 , respectively , i.e. @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "according to the analysis presented in the previous section , at such values of the normalized driving amplitude exact wave packet reconstruction , corresponding to fractional dl , should be observed at times multiplies than @xmath119 .",
    "this is clearly shown in fig.3 . in the left panels of figs.3(a - d )",
    "we show the numerically - computed evolution of the occupation probabilities @xmath15 for the initial condition @xmath120 and for the four values of @xmath11 corresponding to fractional dl indicated by the vertical arrows in fig.2 . in the right panels of the figures , the detailed evolution of @xmath121 and @xmath122",
    "is also shown .",
    "the figures clearly show that wave packet reconstruction is attained at time @xmath123 ( and integer multiplies ) .",
    "note also that , in case of fig.3(a ) and ( c ) , i.e. for an odd value of @xmath20 , mirror inversion is also observed at time @xmath124 .",
    "this is due to the fact that , according to the property ( iv ) discussed in the previous section , for odd values of @xmath20 the two - level system flips the two states at the time @xmath124 . in figure 4",
    "we show , for comparison , the evolution of the occupation probabilities in the dl regime [ fig.4(a ) , @xmath125 , and in the quasi - periodic regime [ fig.4(b ) , @xmath21 ] , where @xmath127 is an irrational number . in the latter case",
    "perfect wave packet reconstruction is not observed , however quantum recurrence can be clearly seen over the observation time .",
    "in this paper we have theoretically investigated quantum recurrence and dynamic localization phenomena in the ac - driven krawtchouk quantum chain .",
    "we have shown that the hopping dynamics in the quantum chain with an arbitrary number of @xmath128 sites can be mapped into the tunneling problem of @xmath60 non interacting bosons in an ac - driven double well system .",
    "such an equivalence enables to establish a few important properties of quantum transport in the ac - driven krawtchouk quantum chain and to predict a new type of dynamic localization .",
    "in particular , we have shown that quantum recurrence , which is predicted by the general quantum recurrence theorem , is _ exact _ for the krawtchouk quantum chain in a dense range of the driving amplitude and related to the existence of so - called fractional dynamic localization . as opposed to ordinary dl ,",
    "at which full collapse of the quasi energy spectrum occurs , fractional dl corresponds to a set of partial quasi - energy collapses .",
    "moreover , like for the undriven krawtchouk quantum chain , it has been shown that mirror inversion can be also observed in fractional dl under certain conditions .",
    "the phenomenon of fractional dl , which is the main result of the present study , could be experimentally demonstrated is spin chains using nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite or in photonic transport using evanescently - coupled optical waveguides arrays with engineered couplings @xcite . in the latter system ,",
    "the ac driving filed can be simply mimicked by periodical axis bending of the waveguide structure @xcite .",
    "it is envisaged that our results could be of interest in the field of coherent quantum transport and control , where transferring quantum states efficiently between distant nodes of an information processing circuit is of major importance for scalable quantum computing .",
    "for example , exploitation of fractional dl could be important for controlling and tune the coherent transfer time for mirror inversion : while in the undriven ( static ) krawtchouk quantum chain this time is fixed by the hopping rate @xmath1 of the engineered hamiltonian , in the ac - driven chain the transfer time is determined by the frequency of the external field and can be thus properly tuned .",
