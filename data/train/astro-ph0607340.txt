    "one of the most important changes in observational astronomy of the 21st century is a rapid shift from classical object - by - object observations to extensive automatic surveys .",
    "as ccd detectors are getting better and their prices are getting lower , more and more small and medium - size observatories are refocusing their attention to detection of stellar variability through systematic sky - scanning missions .",
    "this trend is aditionally powered by the success of pioneering surveys such as asas @xcite , denis @xcite , ogle @xcite , tass @xcite , their space counterpart _ hipparcos _ @xcite and others .",
    "such surveys produce massive amounts of data and it is not at all clear how these data are to be reduced and analysed .",
    "this is especially striking in the eclipsing binary ( eb ) field , where most frequently used tools are optimized for object - by - object analysis . a clear need for thorough , reliable and fully automated approaches to modeling and analysis of eb data",
    "is thus obvious .",
    "this task is very difficult because of limited data quality , non - uniform phase coverage and parameter interdependency . in an ongoing effort to create an automatic eb reduction pipeline , we put powell s direction set method to the test . to the best of our knowledge , powell s direction set method was never used before for solving the inverse problem of ebs .",
    "often neglected and overlooked , powell s direction set method ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 7 ) is a derivativeless multi - dimensional method that utilizes 1-dimensional minimization algorithm along a chosen direction in parameter hyperspace .",
    "it is quadratically convergent , which makes it one of the fastest methods for solving non - linear minimization problems .",
    "the basic idea of powell s method is to select a starting point @xmath0 in parameter hyperspace , and minimize the cost function along some chosen direction vector @xmath1 using 1-d minimizer such as bracketing or brent s parabolic method ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 5 ) .",
    "there is a wealth of direction set method derivatives which differ only on how and at which point of iteration is the next direction vector @xmath1 chosen @xcite .",
    "the most appreciated scheme for choosing successive directions is the conjugate gradient method , which we now briefly describe .",
    "when the cost function is minimized along the direction @xmath1 , the gradient in the obtained minimum is necessarily perpendicular to that direction .",
    "if it were not , that would mean that the projection of the gradient to that direction is non - null , which would in turn mean that the point was not really a minimum .",
    "the cost function may be expanded in taylor series around that minimum : @xmath2 @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the negative gradient of @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the hessian matrix of second partial derivatives of @xmath5 at @xmath7 .",
    "the gradient is then simply expressed as : @xmath8 from eq .",
    "( [ powell_gradient ] ) we may immediately deduce the change of the gradient along the chosen direction : @xmath9    to adopt the best possible direction from the found minimum @xmath7 , the method must seek an orthogonal ( conjugate ) direction to the former direction vector , which obviously has to point along the direction of the gradient .",
    "if the former direction is denoted with @xmath1 and the new direction is denoted with @xmath10 , then : @xmath11    when eq .",
    "( [ conjugates ] ) holds for vectors @xmath1 and @xmath10 , they are said to be _",
    "conjugate_. for as long as the minimization is done _ only _ in conjugate directions , a single minimization along a given direction is necessary , which implies quadratic convergence . note that there is no need to compute the gradients at any point  only the orthogonality condition is used .",
    "this enables powell s direction set method to preserve its derivativeless nature .",
    "to assess the successfulness of powell s direction set method for ebs , we implemented the algorithm in phoebe @xcite . for comparison purposes the simulation setup is identical to that of nelder & mead s downhill simplex benchmarking @xcite .",

    "attractors  regions in parameter hyperspace that attract most convergence traces  reveal the shape of the minimum and parameter correlations that lead to degeneracy issues .",
    "this method is known as _ heuristic scanning _ ( hs ) and is described in detail by @xcite . during hs , only powell s direction set method was used .",
    "additionally , passband luminosities @xmath27 were computed instead of being fitted and color index constraining was used to disentangle effective temperatures of individual components ( see @xcite for rationale and details of color index constraining ) .    ,",

    "since dc is based on computing and evaluating derivatives , it is known to diverge when parameters are not close to the minimum .",
    "nms on the other hand always converges , but the hs solution needs to be _ focused _ by subsequent parameter kicking ( c.f .",
    "@xcite and fig .",
    "6 therein ) .",
    "powell s method is superior in this respect because the solution depicted on fig .",
    "[ hs ] is determined without any need for additional focusing .",
    "panels show the cross - sections between fitted parameters : potentials @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the inclination @xmath22 , secondary star s effective temperature @xmath28 and the normalized @xmath29 cost function value @xmath30 .",
    "emerging shapes of the obtained minima indicate _ regions _ ( rather than individual points ) that contain the solution ; * 2 ) * the required number of iterations to reach the desired fractional accuracy in parameter values is significantly lower than that of dc or nms . fig .",
    "[ hist ] depicts the comparison between the number of iterations required by the nms method ( left ) and powell s method ( right ) .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that the number of iterations does not directly translate to the number of function evaluations : powell s method performs line minimization in each iteration .",
    "if this minimization is performed in a direction along which the fitted parameters are correlated , it will require many function evaluations .",
    "this implies that the time cost of the overall computation does not scale with the number of iterations directly but rather depends on solution degeneracy and topology of the hyperspace .",
    "still , given the problem at hand , powell s method required roughly 5 times less cpu time than the nms .",
    "in all physical parameters for nelder and mead s downhill simplex ( nms ) method ( left ) and powell s method ( right ) .",
    "clearly powell s method is superior to the nms .",
    "note , however , that the number of iterations does not directly translate to the number of function evaluations ( and thus time cost ) : within 1 iteration powell s method performs line minimization along the chosen direction , which may in some circumstances imply many function evaluations.,title=\"fig:\",width=245,height=122 ]   in all physical parameters for nelder and mead s downhill simplex ( nms ) method ( left ) and powell s method ( right ) .",

    "powell s method provides a solid base for further studies dedicated to solving the inverse problem for ebs in a fully automatic manner .",
    "there are two important problems that need to be worked out in order to optimize the application of this method : * 1 ) * the non - ortogonality explicitly depends on the mass ratio @xmath31 and the synchronicity parameter @xmath32 ( c.f .",
    "eq .  2 of @xcite ) , yet both @xmath31 and @xmath32 appear as independent parameters in the model . ] of parameter hyperspace due to classical formulation of the problem needs to be removed , which will eliminate problematic directions for line minimization and thus significantly reduce the number of function evaluations , hence the time cost ; * 2 ) * seek alternate algorithms for determining subsequent sets of directions that would better suit the problem at hand . in particular , initial directions that are now set along individual parameters could be better estimated by the singular value decomposition ( svd ) : a method that quantifies the influence of a given parameter on the fit . this way the method could rapidly descend toward the minimum in the initial iteration already .",
    "although powell s direction set method seems to be most promising for automatic modeling and analysis , its time cost is still significant for large - scale surveys and needs to be furtherly reduced in future .      ,",
