    "quantum measurement is one of the simplest , yet most important , physical processes @xcite . without measurement , we see no event and obtain no information .",
    "a quantum measurement is a process that maps the quantum state of a quantum system to the classical state ( probability distribution ) of an external classical system that belongs to the observer side .",
    "it is known that the interface ( border ) between quantum and classical systems can be shifted .",
    "in fact , an observer does not interact with the system itself .",
    "instead , they extract information from another system , a measurement apparatus , that has direct contact with the system . both the system and the measurement apparatus can be treated quantum mechanically .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to investigate the energy and interaction required for measuring an observable .",
    "more precisely , we investigate the energy of a quantum apparatus and the strength of interaction between a system and the apparatus so that the process is fully described by quantum theory . to put the question from a more pragmatic viewpoint ,",
    "our interest is in the  amount of resource \" required to perform a measurement ( or information transfer ) task @xcite .",
    "thus , to study this problem , the interface between quantum and classical systems must be located such that the apparatus is treated quantum mechanically .",
    "for instance , although we have an equivalent minimum description ( called an instrument @xcite ) of the dynamics and measurement results that puts the interface between the system and the apparatus , our problem does not allow us to employ it because our interest is in the limitations of the quantum apparatus . in section [ section2 ] , we discuss how  large \" the quantum side ( or quantum apparatus ) must be to describe a measurement process in a fully quantum manner .",
    "we examine a so - called standard measurement model to find that the model requires an external system switching on the measurement interaction between a system and an apparatus . in this sense ,",
    "the measurement process is not closed - it is not described in a fully quantum manner in this model .",
    "this model does not obey any non - trivial energy - time uncertainty relation .",
    "this conclusion agrees with previous results @xcite .",
    "then , in section [ section3 ] , we rigorously formulate a quantum apparatus as a timing device that autonomously switches on a perturbation .",
    "an argument on the analyticity shows that the total hamiltonian must be two - side unbounded to fulfill the conditions for the timing device .",
    "our main results are presented in section [ section4 ] .",
    "we consider a measurement apparatus that autonomously switches on the interaction at a certain time .",
    "we show that there is an energy - time uncertainty type relation between the fluctuation of the apparatus hamiltonian and time duration of the measurement .",
    "the proof of this trade - off relation is given by combining two kinds of uncertainty relations .",
    "we first observe that a perfect measurement of a given observable implies a perfect distortion of the conjugate states .",
    "this property is called an information - disturbance relation and is related to an uncertainty relation for a joint measurement .",
    "we then employ the mandelstam - tamm uncertainty relation to obtain a restriction on time and energy required for the distortion .",
    "in addition , because the measurement process involves an information transfer from the system to the apparatus , the interaction between them should not be too weak .",
    "in fact , in section [ section5 ] we show a trade - off relation between the strength of interaction and the measurement time .",
    "the robertson uncertainty relation plays an essential role in the proof . in section [ section6 ]",
    "we illustrate an argument of the spacetime uncertainty relation as an application of our result .",
    "let us consider a quantum system described by a hilbert space @xmath3 .",
    "a quantum state is represented as a density operator on @xmath3 .",
    "we first present a description when we put an interface between the quantum and external classical systems just outside this system . by measuring an observable",
    ", we obtain an outcome . in general",
    ", the outcome is not definite and only a probability distribution on the outcome set is determined .",
    "thus the measurement of an observable maps the quantum state of a quantum system to the classical state ( probability distribution ) of an external classical system which belongs to the observer side . for a map to be consistent with an interpretation based on probability , it must be an affine map .",
    "each affine map is completely described by a positive - operator - valued measure ( povm ) in the quantum system ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a povm ( with a discrete outcome set @xmath4 ) is defined as a family of positive operators @xmath5 satisfying @xmath6 .",
    "a povm @xmath7 gives a probability distribution @xmath8 $ ] on an outcome set @xmath9 .",
    "a povm @xmath10 is called a projection - valued measure ( pvm ) , or a sharp observable , if each @xmath11 is a projection operator .",
    "next we shift the interface between the quantum and classical systems .",
    "the measurement process is a physical interaction between a system and a measurement apparatus .",
    "we treat the apparatus as a quantum system described by a hilbert space @xmath12 . by taking @xmath12 to be sufficiently large",
    ", we can expect the total system to be ( approximately ) closed .",
    "thus the total dynamics is specified by a hamiltonian @xmath13 .",
    "the total hamiltonian can be decomposed into three parts @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 ( resp .",
    "@xmath16 ) acts only on @xmath3 ( resp .",
    "@xmath12 ) and @xmath17 describes an interaction hamiltonian acting on @xmath18 .",
    "( more precisely , the total hamiltonian should be written as @xmath19 . )",
    "the initial state of the composite system at time @xmath20 is described by @xmath21 with an unknown state @xmath22 of the system and a fixed initial state @xmath23 of the apparatus .",
    "this evolves according to the von neumann equation up to a certain predetermined time @xmath24 , where the time duration @xmath2 is called a measurement time duration .",
    "then an observer outside these quantum systems observes a meter observable @xmath25 , which is a povm on the apparatus .",
    "this whole process is said to describe a measurement process of an observable @xmath26 if @xmath27 = \\mbox{tr}[({\\mathbf{1}}\\otimes { \\mathsf{e}}_x)e^{-i\\frac{h \\tau}{\\hbar } } ( \\rho \\otimes \\sigma ) e^{- \\frac{h\\tau}{\\hbar}}]$ ] holds for every @xmath22 .",
    "the above physical measurement model is consistent with the abstract measurement theory by ozawa s extension theorem @xcite and has been shown to be useful in analyzing real measurement processes .",
    "this model , however , is not sufficient for obtaining general results on the minimum energy fluctuation required for a measurement . in order to illustrate this point , we consider the following example , a so - called standard measurement model developed essentially by von neumann @xcite .",
    "suppose that a system is a qubit ( thus @xmath28 ) and an apparatus is a one - particle system on a real line ( see fig .",
    "[ figure_switch11 ] ) .",
    ".,width=340 ]    set @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 represents the momentum operator . as the meter observable",
    "we employ @xmath33 . for an arbitrary time duration @xmath2 , if the initial state at time @xmath20 of the apparatus is prepared in a narrowly - localized state with respect to a position , the accuracy of the measurement of @xmath34 can be made arbitrarily high",
    ". therefore , there is no limitation on the time and energy required for this measurement process .    by looking carefully at this model ,",
    "one may notice that the time duration is given by hand . in this model , the interaction between a system and an apparatus is switched on at @xmath20 and switched off at @xmath24 .",
    "the dynamics outside this time interval is not discussed .",
    "an external observer must put these systems together at @xmath20 , which until then must have been somehow independent .",
    "thus the mechanism initiating this switching - on process is supposed to be outside the quantum model . in this sense , this model is not closed and we need to shift the interface further to include the on - and - off switching process .    in the discussion below , we develop a general measurement process that also treats this switching - on ( and off ) mechanism quantum mechanically . in some situations , roughly speaking , we shift the quantum - classical interface so that the quantum side includes the experimenter who controls the apparatus . in the next section",
    "we give a mathematically rigorous formulation of the timing device that switches on a perturbation .",
    "as stated above , we investigate an apparatus that works not only as an information extractor but also as a switching device for an interaction ( perturbation ) .",
    "to do so , in this section , we study a formulation of the latter condition and derive some results .",
    "we consider an apparatus that works as a timing device to switch on an interaction at a certain time after @xmath20 .",
    "thus , we assume that at time @xmath20 the state of the total system is a product state .",
    "the apparatus is specified by the hilbert space @xmath12 , hamiltonian @xmath16 and a state @xmath35 at time @xmath20 .",
    "let us first assume that the apparatus is perfectly isolated and has no interaction with the system",
    ". then the time evolution is described by a von neumann equation determined by an apparatus hamiltonian @xmath16 which acts only on @xmath12 . for an arbitrary time @xmath36",
    ", the state at time @xmath37 is written as @xmath38 .",
    "next , we consider an interaction between the system and apparatus .",
    "we denote the hilbert space of the system by @xmath3 .",
    "the individual dynamics of the system is governed by the hamiltonian @xmath15 defined on @xmath3 .",
    "thus the total hamiltonian has three parts , @xmath39 , where @xmath17 is the interaction hamiltonian that acts on the tensor product @xmath18 .",
    "the time evolution of a state @xmath40 ( a density operator ) over the composite system is described by the corresponding von neumann equation , @xmath41 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    let us consider conditions for @xmath16 , @xmath17 and a state of the apparatus to describe a timing device .",
    "they must satisfy the following general conditions that represent the capability to switch on the interaction at a certain time .",
    "the apparatus evolves freely up to time @xmath20 and then switches on an interaction with the system at some time after @xmath20 .",
    "thus , the state of the apparatus should be decoupled from that of the system until time @xmath20 .",
    "the time evolution of the state is determined entirely once the state at a certain time is given .",
    "we impose the following condition on the dynamics and the state at time @xmath20 :    [ cond1 ] ( no interaction up to time @xmath20 ) an apparatus ( specified by @xmath16 , @xmath17 and a state @xmath35 at time @xmath20 ) satisfies _ the no interaction condition up to time @xmath20 _ if for any @xmath42 and for any state @xmath22 of the system , @xmath43 = 0 \\label{cond1eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] holds , where @xmath44 .",
    "we emphasize that in condition [ cond1 ] , the left - hand side of ( [ cond1eq ] ) must be vanishing for any @xmath22 .",
    "this condition implies that only after the apparatus reaches @xmath35 , does @xmath17 induce the apparatus and the system to interact .",
    "in fact the following lemma shows that these conditions are equivalent .      ",
    "if part \" : we differentiate by @xmath37 , @xmath48 to obtain @xmath49   = [ h_s + h_a , \\rho(t ) \\otimes \\sigma(t)].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as the left - hand side is written as @xmath50 $ ] , we obtain @xmath51=0 $ ] . as @xmath22 is arbitrary , we obtain condition [ cond1 ] .",

    "thus we conclude that @xmath53 satisfies the von neumann equation whose integration is ( [ cond1int ] ) .",

    "note that this condition is rather weak .",

    "[ ex1 ] suppose that an apparatus is described by @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",

    "that is , the support of @xmath80 is included in @xmath81 for some @xmath82 .",
    "the freely evolved state of the apparatus can be written as @xmath83 , which has support in @xmath84 .",
    "it is easy to see that this system - plus - apparatus satisfies condition [ cond1 ] .",
