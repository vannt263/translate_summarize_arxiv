    "the existence of different families of quarks and leptons is a puzzle .",
    "it is important to try to explain why the ckm matrix is diagonally dominant and to understand the values of the masses of the quarks .",
    "one way to understand the additional flavours is to look for some symmetry between the families  @xcite . in the quark sector",
    "the way that the symmetries are searched for is to look for connections between the quark masses and the ckm matrix elements .",
    "there has been a long history of looking for patterns in the quark masses and the ckm matrix elements  @xcite .",
    "given that there is no theory that predicts symmetries between families , the subject is driven by the size of the errors on the ckm matrix elements and quark masses .",
    "the reduced errors bars on the ckm matrix from the experimental results from b factories  @xcite and improved theoretical predictions from techniques such as lattice qcd have already ruled out some proposed relationships between quark masses and ckm matrix elements .",
    "the pdg quote the current error on the strange quark mass as around 30% .",
    "however , this is accurate enough to rule out one of the original predictions : @xmath0 of a 6 texture model  @xcite .",
    "the error on the strange quark mass should be compared to the largest error on a ckm matrix element or ratio of ckm matrix , used in this paper , of 10% .",
    "the subject of mass and flavor mixing has been reviewed by fritzsch and xing  @xcite , froggatt  @xcite , and babu  @xcite .",
    "recently the hpqcd collaborations have determined the masses of the strange , charm , and bottom quarks with an error of under 2% from unquenched lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "the milc collaboration had previously determined the ratio and sum of the masses of the up and down quarks  @xcite .",
    "the unprecedented precision stems from fitting lattice correlators in the continuum limit to continuum perturbation theory that depends on the masses of the charm and bottom quarks .",
    "the powerful techniques of multiloop qcd in the continuum have been used to compute the correlators to 4 loop order , hence this reduces one of the major systematic errors in lattice qcd calculations of quark masses , the conversion from the lattice results to the @xmath1 scheme .",
    "the light and strange quark masses are determined using the continuum limit of the ratios of quark masses .",
    "the suggestion to use the ratio of the light quark masses to the charm mass was originally suggested in the famous review article by gasser and leutwyler  @xcite .",
    "the basis of these results are generation of gauge configurations with 2 + 1 flavours of sea quark with light pion masses and multiple lattice spacings by the milc collaboration  @xcite . particularly important",
    "are the new gauge configurations at lattice spacings of 0.06 and 0.045 fm , generated by the milc collaboration  @xcite , that were crucial to taking a continuum limit for calculations with valence charm and bottom quarks .",
    "the lattice qcd calculations by the hpqcd collaboration have been tested by prediction of the mass of the @xmath2 meson  @xcite and the @xmath3 meson  @xcite .",
    "a summary of the mass spectrum of heavy - heavy and heavy - light mesons is in  @xcite .",
    "the decay constants of the pion and kaon have been accurately computed  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath4 extracted from the hpqcd collaboration  @xcite is consistent with other non - lattice determinations in  @xcite .",
    "the staggered fermion formalism potentially has a problem with the technical issue of `` rooting of determinants '' .",
    "however , no theoretical work has found any problems  @xcite .",
    "so for the arguments given in this paragraph the use of hpqcd s quark masses is reasonable , rather than using the more conservative errors on the quark masses quoted by the pdg .",
    "scholz  @xcite and leutwyler  @xcite have recently reviewed the status of lattice qcd calculations of quark masses .",
    "apart from one simple example in section  [ se : conc ] , i do nt discuss the relations between the quark masses and lepton masses predicted by some grand unified theories  @xcite .",
    "this would be an important , but separate study and also require running the masses to the gut scale  @xcite in a model dependent way .",
    "see  @xcite for two recent studies .",
    "in this paper i use the new precision results for quark masses from the hpqcd and milc collaborations  @xcite to test some of the relations between ckm matrix elements and quark masses proposed by chkareuli and froggatt  @xcite , and fritzsch and xing  @xcite .",
    "a goal of this project was to find out how accurately do we need to know the masses of the up , down and strange quarks .",
    "the part of the standard model lagrangian that describes the quark masses is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a index over flavour .",
    "the mass matrices @xmath7 and @xmath8 are diagonalized to obtain the quark masses , @xmath9 by the order 3 unitary matrices @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "the ckm matrix is @xmath14 a key prediction of the standard model is that the @xmath15 matrix is unitary .",
    "the experimental program at the b factories have not found any significant deviation from unitarity  @xcite .",
    "although there are perhaps some hints  @xcite . the ckm matrix can be determined using the results from lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "the idea is to look for some special structure in the mass mixing matrices @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "for example there could be zeros in the mass matrices , which are known as textures  @xcite .",
    "one concern about this is that a special basis is chosen and the patterns could be removed by a transformation  @xcite .",
    "the hope is that in some basis the physics is more transparent .",
    ".summary of quark masses and ratios of quark masses from the hpqcd and milc collaborations  @xcite , the pdg  @xcite , and langenfeld et al .",
    "@xcite [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     fritzsch and xing  @xcite investigated a number of 4 texture mass matrices . a subset of the relations between quark masses and ckm matrix elements , that they derived , are below .",
    "@xmath16    the numerical comparison of the relations between ckm matrix elements and quark masses derived by fritzsch and xing  @xcite are in table  [ tb : imppred ] . the improved prediction for @xmath17 in equation  [ eq : vubcb ] now only disagrees with the prediction of the quark masses from the pdg at the @xmath18 level .",
    "however , using the more accurate quark masses from the hpqcd / milc collaboration , the predictions of fritzsch and xing  @xcite for @xmath17 and @xmath19 disagree with experiment by over 3@xmath20 .",
    "in this paper i have used the new high precision results for quark masses from the hpqcd and milc collaborations to test some predictions for relations between ckm matrix elements . to illustrate the point i used some older ansatze  @xcite for the quark matrices .",
    "the new accurate results for the quark masses from hpqcd and milc essentially ruled out the two models .",
    "many other studies of textures , such as  @xcite , would benefit from more accurate values for the quark masses .    at the moment the smallest errors on the quark masses come from one unquenched lattice qcd calculation .",
    "although in the introduction i briefly reviewed how well validated hpqcd s calculation were against experiment , it would clearly be preferable to have accurate results from other lattice formalisms . recent reviews of dynamical lattice qcd calculations show that many groups have access to data with pion masses at least at 300 mev , multiple lattice spacings and volumes  @xcite , so the prospects for reductions in the errors of quark masses from other formulations is good",
    ".    it would be interesting to also use precision lattice qcd results for quark masses to test the predictions of grand unified theories . in guts",
    "there could be relationships between lepton and quark masses at some renormalization scale .",
    "for example georgi and jarlskog suggested  @xcite ( see babu  @xcite for a review ) , a relationship between the masses of the down and strange quarks , and the masses of the muon and electron masses .",
    "@xmath21 the factor of @xmath22 in equation  [ eq : glrelats ] is from the square of the number of colours .",
    "experimentally , @xmath23 = 21.3 .",
    "the new lattice qcd numbers from the hpqcd collaboration , give @xmath24 = 19.3(5 ) , while the current ranges from the pdg give @xmath24 = 20.3(2.5 ) .",
    "so the new results from hpqcd for the quark masses are inconsistent with the relation in equation  [ eq : glrelats ] at the 4@xmath20 level at low energy .",
    "however , equation  [ eq : glrelats ] only needs to hold at the unification scale and a more detailed study would include the effects of additional particles , such as those from susy models  @xcite .    to test the texture relations the errors on the ratios of quark masses need to be at least the relative size of the errors on the relevant ckm matrix elements .",
    "for example the @xmath25 ckm matrix element is currently known to under 1% accuracy , so a similar accuracy is required for ratios of quark masses for a good test of the predictions of textures .",
    "the results from improved lattice qcd calculations will also reduce the errors on ckm matrix elements , such as @xmath25  @xcite .    the predictions in equations  [ eq : frogpredictus ] ,  [ eq : frogpredictcb ] ,  [ eq : frogpredictub ] and  [ eq : glrelats ] critically depend on the values of the masses of the up and down quarks .",
    "currently the lattice results for the masses of the up and down quarks are based on the method developed by the milc collaborations  @xcite .",
    "in particular the majority of the error on the ratio @xmath26 is due their treatment of electromagnetic effects .",
    "there are new lattice qcd calculations  @xcite that explicitly include electromagnetism  @xcite , or estimate the corrections  @xcite that should reduce the errors on the masses of the up and down quarks obtained from lattice qcd calculations .",
    "as reviewed by babu  @xcite , the structure of the quark mass matrices could be caused by `` flavon fields ''  @xcite .",
    "although the dynamics that generates the quark mass matrices could be at the planck energy , there could also be measurable effects at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "i thank christine davies for valuable comments on this paper .",
    "this research used resources of the argonne leadership computing facility at argonne national laboratory , which is supported by the office of science of the u.s .",
