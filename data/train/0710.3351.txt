    "@xmath5 10@xmath6 @xmath7 ) massive x - ray binaries have been discovered by the _ integral _  hard x - ray ( @xmath5 15 kev ) satellite @xcite .",
    "the prototypical case is igr j163184848  which shows variable high obscuration in the x - ray , sometimes reaching @xmath4  @xmath8 2 @xmath9 10@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "its bright optical and near - infrared ( ir ) counterpart is an early b - type supergiant star with numerous emission lines @xcite .",
    "interestingly the obscuration toward igr j163184848obtained in the optical and near - ir wavebands ( @xmath11  @xmath2 18 ) is almost two orders of magnitude smaller than that inferred from the x - rays , which suggests that the extreme obscuration seen in the x - ray is intrinsic only to the x - ray source .",
    "however , @xmath11  @xmath2 18 is still greater than the interstellar obscuration , indicating the existence of substantial circumstellar material around the supergiant companion .    in order to fully understand the implications of the",
    "_ integral_discoveries  specifically if they imply existence of a separate class of highly - obscured x - ray binaries  we must investigate any similarities between the new _ integral _  sources and previously known sources . as already suggested by @xcite ,",
    "the x - ray pulsar gx 3012appears similar to the new _ integral _  highly - obscured massive x - ray binaries : it has variable x - ray obscuration of @xmath4  @xmath8 10@xmath610@xmath10 @xmath7 , the compact source is a neutron star , and the optical companion is an early b - type supergiant ( or hypergiant ; * ? ? ?",

    "this is suggestive that they have very similar circumstellar material which may be related to their strong x - ray obscuration . in this _ letter _ , we present the results of _ spitzer _  mid - ir spectroscopic observations of igr j163184848  and gx 3012 , showing that both sources indeed have very similar rich mid - ir properties previously unknown for x - ray binaries .",
    "we observed igr j163184848  and gx 3012  with _ infrared spectrogrpah _ ( irs ) aboard _ spitzer _",
    "@xcite on 2005 september 8 and 2005 july 2 , respectively .",
    "the duration of the total observations was 1.32 ( igr j163184848 ) and 0.82 ( gx 3012 ) hours with the all six irs modules in operation in the standard staring mode , obtaining two nods of spectra separated by 1/3 of the slit length .",
    "for the basic data reduction , we used the co - added basic calibration data ( bcd ) produced through the standard _ spitzer _",
    "science center data reduction pipeline ( s13.2.0 ) , and also the _ spitzer _  irs custom extraction ( i.e. , spice ) software ( v1.3-beta1 ) . in the low - resolution mode",
    "where the slit lengths are large ( i.e. , 57  for 5.214.5 @xmath13 m and 168  for 14.038.0 @xmath13 m ) , we subtracted out background emission of one nod using the spectrum of the another nod , and combined the two background - subtracted spectra for the final spectrum .",
    "however , in the high - resolution mode , the small slit length ( i.e. , 113 for 9.919.6 @xmath13 m and 223 for 18.737.2 @xmath13 m ) , together with the high brightnesses of the sources , made it impossible to subtract out the background .",
    "therefore , we just combined the spectra from the two nods for the final high - resolution spectrum without any background subtraction .",
    "in addition , we used irsclean ( v1.5 ) to mask and clean rogue pixels from the co - added bcd images , and then interpolated over neighboring normal pixels .",
    "some emission features , such as ionic forbidden lines , @xmath3  lines , and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission , present in the low - resolution spectra appear extended .",
    "here we consider just the emission from point sources , and defer discussion of the extended emission to a separate paper .",
    "figure  [ fig : igrj ] presents the background - subtracted low - resolution spectrum of igr j163184848 , as well as the best - fit spectra of the continuum emission and the residual of the sed fit ( see below ) .",
    "note that the low - resolution spectrum is extracted for the continuum source ( i.e. , igr j163184848 ) based on the standard point source extraction procedure of spice .",
    "several features are prominent in figure  [ fig : igrj ] , including complicated multi - component continuum emission , broad and strong absorption around 9.7 and 18 @xmath13 m , and numerous emission lines .",
    "the spectrum of gx 3012  ( figure  [ fig : gx ] ) is similar , with strong continuum emission , silicate absorptions feature around 9.7 @xmath13 m , and several emission lines .    as in figures  [ fig : igrj ] and [ fig : gx ] , the silicate absorption features and numerous emission lines make it difficult to carry out any meaningful independent sed fits of the shorter wavelength ( i.e. , @xmath14 @xmath12 8 @xmath13 m ) data of the irs spectra .",
    "therefore , instead , we first examined if the irs seds at the shorter wavelengths are consistent with what have been found in paper  i using only the line - free regions . according to paper  i ,",
    "the seds of igr j163184848  and gx 3012  at @xmath14  @xmath12  8  @xmath13 m have contributions from hot ( i.e.,t @xmath8 1040  k for igr j163184848  and 720  k for gx 3012 ) dust emission and stellar emission of a b0i star with temperature of 26000  k , while the contribution of free - free emission is negligible .",
    "our irs seds of the line - free regions in figures  [ fig : igrj ] and [ fig : gx ] at @xmath14  @xmath12  8@xmath13 m were fitted very well with those parameters , resulting in the reduced chi - square @xmath15 @xmath12 1 .",
    "we used the extinction @xmath11  = 18.5 and 7.1 for igr j163184848  and gx 3012 , respectively , as in paper  i. however , in the longer wavelength ( i.e. , @xmath14  @xmath5  22  @xmath13 m ) range , we were unable to fit the irs seds with the given hot dust and stellar parameters because the best fit resulted in unacceptably large chi - square values .",
    "we therefore performed sed fits with three components ( i.e. , hot dust , stellar , and warm dust component ) using the entire line - free seds in the @xmath14  @xmath12  8  @xmath13 m and @xmath5  22  @xmath13 m range . over the fits",
    "the parameters of the warm dust component were treated as free parameters , while those of the hot dust and stellar component were fixed to be the values in paper  i. as a result , we obtained the warm dust temperature of 190  k ( igr j163184848 ) and 170  k ( gx 3012 ) with @xmath15 @xmath8 1.2 ( igr j163184848 ) and 1.5 ( gx 3012 ) .",
    "we used the extinction coefficients compiled in @xcite excluding the 822 @xmath13 m range in order to avoid the uncertainties of the coefficients associated with the silicate absorption features .",
    "we instead interpolated the extinction coefficients at @xmath14 @xmath12 8 and @xmath5 22 @xmath13 m to calculate the silicate absorption - free extinction coefficients in the @xmath14 = 822 @xmath13 m range , and used them in the fits .",
    "the main panel of figures  [ fig : igrj ] and [ fig : gx ] presents the results of our best sed fit obtained by excluding the silicate absorption features , where we can confirm that the fit matches nicely the observed sed except the @xmath14 = 822 @xmath13 m range . in the bottom panel , on the other hand",
    ", we show the redisuals of the fit obtained by subtracting the fluxes computed by the best fit from the observed values . for this residual construction , in order to see if our best sed fit is consistent with the observed silicate absorption features , we combined the best - fit parameters obtained at @xmath14 @xmath12 8 and @xmath5 22 @xmath13 m with the extinction coefficients in the @xmath14 = 822 @xmath13 m range @xcite , and calculated the silicate absorption feature - associated fluxes expected by the best sed fit in the @xmath14 = 822 @xmath13 m range .",
    "the residuals in figures  [ fig : igrj ] and [ fig : gx ] show that overall our best sed fit agrees with the silicate absorption features reasonably well , although there appears to be some small discrepancies for igr j163184848 .",
    "the masses of the dust components were estimated under the optically thin assumption @xcite : @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the distance to the source , @xmath18 is the dust mass absorption coefficient , and @xmath19 is the planck function at temperature @xmath0 . using the interstellar mass absorption coefficients of @xcite at 8 and 25 @xmath13 m , the hot and warm dust masses are estimated to be @xmath20 @xmath8 4.5 @xmath9 10@xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23and",
    "@xmath24 @xmath8 3.1 @xmath9 10@xmath25 @xmath22 @xmath23for igr j163184848 ; @xmath20 @xmath8 5.7 @xmath9 10@xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23  and @xmath24 @xmath8 1.4 @xmath9",
    "10@xmath25 @xmath22 @xmath23  for gx 3012 , where @xmath26 is the distance to the sources normalized by 5 kpc .",
    "the silicate absorption features seen in figures  [ fig : igrj ] and [ fig : gx ] have a tight linear correlation with the optical extinction in the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) , although the correlation has been reported to break down in dense enviornment where the silicate feature does not show a monotonic increase with extinction at @xmath11  @xmath27 12 mag ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the correlation in the diffuse ism is @xmath11/@xmath28 = 18.5 .",
    "if we adopt the above correlation given in the diffuse ism , the intensity ratio of the observed spectrum to the unabsorbed spectrum in figures  [ fig : igrj ] and [ fig : gx ] at 9.7 @xmath13 m correspond to @xmath11  @xmath2  18.5 and @xmath2  6 for igr j163184848  and gx 3012 , respectively , these are very similar to the values obtained in previous studies for the total optical extinctions of the both sources .",
    "this suggests that a substantial portion , if not all , of the silicate features seen in figures  [ fig : igrj ] and [ fig : gx ] are associated with the optical extinction of igr j163184848  and gx 3012 .",
    "figures  [ fig : igrjhigh ] and [ fig : gxhigh ] present high - resolution spectrum of igr j163184848  and gx 3012 , revealing numerous emission lines .",
    "( note that the background emission is _ not _ subtracted . )",
    "the majority of them are lines , while the rest consists of metallic forbidden lines , pure rotational @xmath3  lines , and 11.3 @xmath13 m pah emission feature .",
    "table  [ tbl_hi ] lists the intensities of some of the bright lines identified in both sources with high ( @xmath1 3 ) signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the line intensities and the signal - to - noise ratio were estimated with gaussian profile fits .",
    "the intensities of the lines are consistent with gas at @xmath0 @xmath8 10@xmath29 k and with @xmath30  @xmath8 10@xmath29 @xmath31  in the menzel case  b state , following @xcite , although the intensity ratios are not very sensitive to those parameters @xcite .",
    "table  [ tbl_other ] lists the parameters of forbidden ionic lines and @xmath3  lines . for the forbidden lines , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , and [ ]",
    "were detected in both sources , while [ ]  and [ ]  were only in igr j163184848 ; [ ] is only in gx 3012 .",
    "the @xmath3  lines were detected in both sources .",
    "the intensity ratio of the [ ]  lines of 18.7 and 33.5 @xmath13 m is diagnostic of the number density in the temperature range of 500020000  k. the extinction - corrected [ ]  line surface brightness ratio of 18.7/33.5 @xmath13 m is 1.21 for igr j163184848  and 1.68 for gx 3012 : according to the calculation of @xcite and @xcite , the ratios correspond to the electron number density @xmath30  @xmath2 1000 @xmath31  for both sources . on the other hand ,",
    "the intensity ratio of the [ ]  line ( 12.8 @xmath13 m ) and the [ ]  line ( 15.6 @xmath13 m ) is sensitive to the hardness of the radiation , or temperature of the environment .",
    "if we use the calculation of @xcite , the extinction - corrected intensity ratio of [ ] / [ ]  is consistent with @xmath2 4  @xmath9  10@xmath29  k for igr j163184848  and @xmath2 4.5  @xmath9  10@xmath29  k for gx 3012 .",
    "the three @xmath3  lines detected in the both sources are pure rotational transition lines of @xmath3  ( 0,0 )  s(0,1,2 ) which are usually excited by collisions . assuming that the bottom two lines follow the distribution of the local thermodynamic equilibrium and are optically thin , the surface brightness ratios are consistent with the excitation temperature @xmath32 @xmath2 1000  k. the estimated @xmath3  column densities are @xmath2 1 @xmath9 10@xmath33 @xmath7 ( igr j163184848 ) and 5 @xmath9 10@xmath34 @xmath7 ( gx 3012 ) .",
    "this implies that the optical extinction associated with the warm molecular gas is very small , @xmath11  @xmath35 1 , based on the relation @xmath4  = 1.87 @xmath9 10@xmath36 @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "our _ spitzer _  spectroscopic observations of igr j163184848  and gx 3012  have revealed for the first time the rich mid - ir environment of highly - obscured x - ray binaries .",
    "this includes two dust components with prominent silicate absorption , numerous recombination lines , many forbidden ionic lines , and pure rotational @xmath3  lines . based on the observed spectra , we infer the following components for igr j163184848  and gx 3012 : ( 1 ) hot ( @xmath0 @xmath1 700  k ) and warm ( @xmath0 @xmath2 180  k ) circumstellar dust ; ( 2 ) ionized stellar winds responsible for the lines ; ( 3 ) extended low - density ionized regions for the forbidden lines ; and ( 4 ) photo - dissociated regions associated with the pah , @xmath3  and possibly the [ ]  line emission .",
    "for the forbidden lines , all the detected lines have relatively low ionization potentials like in starburst galaxies where the radiation is relatively soft ( compared with active galactic nuclei , for instance ) .",
    "this may indicate that the illumination of hard x - rays from the central compact x - ray source is not primarily responsible for the forbidden line emission .",
    "however , the inferred temperature for the radiation exciting the [ ]  and [ ]  lines is hotter than the stellar photospheres , so there can be some contribution from the compact object . considering that [ ]  and [ ]",
    "were detected only in igr j163184848  while [ ]  was only in gx 3012 , the radiation field of igr j163184848  may be softer than gx 3012 , as demonstrated by the small temperature difference between the two sources ( see   [ sec_highres ] ) .",
    "perhaps the most natural explanation for the origin of the hot dust component relies on dust formation in the dense outflows from the early - type companions of igr j163184848  and gx 3012 , as is the case in most sgb[e ] stars ( i.e. , b - type supergiants with forbidden emission lines ) .",
    "however , the origin of the warm circumstellar dust component is very uncertain , and b[e ] stars seldom show evidence for this type of warm dust .",
    "if both the hot and warm dust components have spherical shell geometres around the central star , then the associated optical extinctions are : @xmath11  @xmath8 4 @xmath9 10@xmath37 @xmath38 ( @xmath39/10@xmath40 @xmath23 ) ( @xmath41/100 k)@xmath29 ( @xmath42/10@xmath43 ergs s@xmath44 ) , where @xmath39 and @xmath41 are the mass and temperature of the dust components , @xmath38 @xmath45 1 is the dust absorption coefficient , and @xmath42 is the ultra - violet luminosity of the central star .",
    "this gives the optical extinctions @xmath11",
    "@xmath35 1 for both the hot and warm dust components of igr j163184848  and gx 3012 .",
    "( here we use 1 @xmath9 10@xmath43 ergs s@xmath44 for @xmath42 for both sources . ) therefore , under the assumption of spherical shell geometry , both the hot and warm dust components of igr j163184848  and gx 3012  contribute very little to the total optical extinction , suggesting that the hot and warm dust components are _ not _ strongly associated with the silicate absorption features .",
    "this also applies to the dust associated with the warm extended @xmath3  gas since the optical extinction from this component is tiny ( i.e. , av @xmath35 1 ; see   [ sec_highres ] ) .",
    "what s then the origin of the silicate absorption features ?",
    "if it is due to the foreground ism , we would expect to see the @xmath46 ice feature around 15 @xmath13 m , especially for igr j163184848 , based on the intensity ratio between the silicate absorption feature and ice feature found in the ism @xcite .",
    "the absence of the ice feature in our spectra supports the interpretation that the silicate absorption features are probably not associated with the foreground ism .",
    "one possibility may be the existence of an undisclosed colder ( e.g. , @xmath35 100  k ) circumstellar dust component which is responsible for the silicate absorption features and most of the optical extinction .",
    "we need further longer wavelength observatons to confirm this possibility .",
    "considering that the 9.7  @xmath13 m silicate absorption feature represents the oxygen - rich material , the existence of the 9.7 micron silicate absorption feature may indicate that the origin of the potential colder dust component is related to the nucleosynthesis of the progenitors of igr j163184848  and gx 3012(or their companions ) .",
    "the optical / near - ir companion of igr j163184848  is a sgb[e ] star .",
    "such stars are known to have hot ( @xmath0 @xmath2 1000  k ) circumstellar dust , and probably are evolving into luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) or wolf - rayet stars .",
    "our mid - ir spectra of igr j163184848  and gx 3012  are very similar to that of the lbv p  cygni which shows many lines and forbidden ionic lines @xcite .",
    "the difference is that while the mid - ir continuum of p  cygni is due to the free - free emission in stellar winds , the main mid - ir emission of igr j163184848  and gx 3012  is from multiple dust continua .",
    "( the seds of both sources observed here are inconsistent with the free - free emission , as mentioned in paper  i. ) however , we note that some lbv stars have also been observed to have thermal mid - ir dust emission @xcite . based on the fact that b[e ] stars seldom show mid - ir forbidden line emission ,",
    "the b - type supergiant ( or hypergiant ) companions of igr j163184848  and gx 3012  may be in the evolutionary track to lbvs , implying that the extremely high obscuration seen in some massive x - ray binaries may be a phenomenon associated with the evolutionary phase .",
    "this scenario is also consistent with the fact that the highly - obscured massive x - ray binary cygnus  x-3 has a wolf - rayet star companion , together with the circumstellar dust emission of @xmath0 @xmath2 250  k @xcite .",
    "this work is based on observations made with the spitzer space telescope , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under a contract with nasa .",
