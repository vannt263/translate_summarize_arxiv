    "the dynamics within the milky way points towards the existence of a large amount of invisible , i.e. dark , matter in the milky way .",
    "many extensions of the standard model of particle physics naturally predict the existence of yet unobserved weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) that do not directly couple to light but only to the weak sector of the standard model . it is thus inviting to explain the failure to understand the dynamics within the milky way based on the visible distribution of matter by the additional abundance of wimps .",
    "the existence of wimps is also in agreement with cosmological structure formation arguments and precision measurements of the dark matter density in the universe .",
    "+ in many models , wimps are expected to be stable on cosmological timescales but have the ability to annihilate into standard model particles . in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model of particle physics with conserved r - parity ,",

    "the photon energies can , depending on the particle dark matter mass , be in the very high energy ( vhe , @xmath3 gev ) @xmath4-ray regime .",
    "the number of expected particle dark matter annihilation events in a given volume is proportional to the dark matter density squared .",
    "large dark matter densities are thus promising for a search for dark matter self annihilation events .",

    "both distributions are normalized such that the density at the position of the sun agrees with the value of @xmath5 derived from different dynamical constraints .",
    "a central result of n - body simulations involving only dark matter particles is that the dark matter density is in general steeply increasing towards the center of galaxies .",

    "however , a perfect discrimination is not possible on an event by event basis and enforces the application of a background subtraction algorithm . frequently used and well tested background subtraction algorithm rely on the definition of a signal and a background region in the same fov ( see @xcite for an overview ) .",
    "the background region has to be constructed such that the instrumental acceptance in the signal and background region are equal .",
    "the number of expected background events in the signal region is then measured under the assumption that the cosmic ray tev flux is isotropic .",
    "this background subtraction approach is well suited for the investigation of signal regions which are much smaller than the fov and leads typically to the ability to detect astrophysical @xmath4-ray point sources with a photon flux of @xmath14 of the crab nebula @xmath4-ray flux ( @xcite ) at a statistical significance of @xmath15 standard deviations within an observation time of @xmath16 h under optimal observation conditions for h.e.s.s .",

    "figure [ density ] shows the projected distances to the galactic center covered in the signal ( magenta , tagged wobble on ) and background ( turquoise , tagged wobble off ) region .",
    "the construction of the background region ensures that the signal region is always closer in angular distance to the galactic center than the background region and the predicted average dark matter density in the signal region is thus larger than in the background region .",
    "the background subtraction method relies thus not on a measurement of signal plus background and background in the same fov but on a measurement of signal plus background and less signal plus background in the same fov .",

    "the array pointing moves forward by @xmath27 min in right ascension immediately after the end of the first observation within a realistic run transition time of @xmath28 min .",

    "the third observation is again scheduled for @xmath26 min immediately after the second observation by moving the array pointing again by @xmath27 min forward in right ascension within @xmath28 min .",
    "finally , the number of events after the application of standard @xmath4-ray cuts in the signal and and the corresponding number of events in background region are compared .",

    "the strong dependence of the h.e.s.s .",
    "i acceptance on the pointing zenith and azimuth angle does in consequence not influence the calculation of a @xmath4-ray excess as the dependence is the same for the signal and the background region .",
    "repeated taking of three run sequences in this observation pattern can accumulate the simulated amount of data .",
    "the advantage is that obviously the signal region can be as large as the h.e.s.s .",
    "fov ( see also the blue region in fig . [ density ] ) and the background regions ( see also the yellow region in fig . [ density ] ) are further away from the signal region with the result of less expected wimp self annihilation @xmath4-ray flux in the background region .",
    "this leads to the expectation that the sensitivity of the on / off observations to a wimp self annihilation @xmath4-ray flux in the milky way halo is better than for the rotated pixel background subtraction technique .",
    "on the other hand , the method needs @xmath29 of the total observation time for the estimation of the expected number of background events in the signal region where the rotated pixel algorithm can use the complete observation time .",
    "it is a non trivial question which of the two competing factors is eventually dominant and therefore this realistic simulation is performed .",

    "driftscan runs are scheduled at a constant zenith and azimuth angle array pointing .",
    "the celestial pointing at the beginning of a run is chosen such that the galactic center region drifts through the fov after approximately half of the @xmath30 min observation time . as for the simulation of on / off events ,",
    "realistic event rates for the observation at @xmath22 zenith angle after standard h.e.s.s .",
    "i @xmath4-ray cuts have been used .",
    "also the radial acceptance as well as the energy dependence of the events after @xmath4-ray cuts and the instrumental dead time resemble real observation conditions .",
    "a total of @xmath31 h of observation time is simulated .",
    "the observed region is divided into many pixels each of which is much smaller than the h.e.s.s .",
    "i angular resolution .",
    "each run is divided in time into one signal region enclosing the galactic center and one background region .",
    "the division of a driftscan run into two halves is realized such that the product of the average time a pixel stays in the h.e.s.s .",
    "i fov with the total solid angle of the region is the same for the signal and background region . as for the rotated pixel technique and",
    "the on / off observations all known @xmath4-ray sources and the galactic plane ( @xmath18 ) are excluded from the analysis .",
    "excluded pixel are shifted mutually in right ascension between signal and background region at constant declination and special care is taken to guarantee that the shifting of the exclusion regions does not imbalance the instrumental acceptance of signal and background region .",
    "every pixel excluded in the signal region is shifted along right ascension and constant declination as close as possible to the edge of the background region to minimize the expected @xmath4-ray flux from wimp annihilation in the background region .",
    "similarly , every pixel excluded in the background region is shifted as close as possible to the edge of the signal region to maximize the expected @xmath4-ray flux from wimp annihilation in the signal region .",
    "+ the observation strategy and the subsequent data analysis ensure again , as for the on / off and rotated pixel method , an equal instrumental acceptance in the signal and background region . also similar to the on / off method , the signal region is larger than for the rotated pixel method and the background region is further away from the galactic center than possible for the rotated pixel method .",
    "these effects should increase the sensitivity to a wimp annihilation @xmath4-ray flux from the galactic halo . on the other hand ,",
    "the increase in sensitivity competes with the decrease in sensitivity due to observation time only used for background observations and the average expected signal flux per signal pixel is smaller than for the on / off method because the signal fov is larger .",
    "again , it is non trivial to estimate which effect dominates and a realistic simulation that compares all three discussed methods under equal conditions is necessary .",

    "no wimp annihilation @xmath4-ray signal is simulated but only background events such that no significant @xmath4-ray excess is resulting in all cases and an upper limit on @xmath20 can be derived which serves as a sensitivity estimation for the method under consideration .",

    "i effective areas and energy threshold lookups for standard hillas cuts ( @xcite ) and with a method that leads to results that are compatible with the method employed in @xcite under equal conditions .",
    "+ figure [ sensi ] shows that the sensitivity to @xmath20 of each method investigated is comparable in the order of magnitude .",
    "the on / off method is slightly more sensitive ( @xmath12 at @xmath21 tev wimp mass ) than the rotated pixel method .",
    "the driftscan method is less sensitive ( @xmath33 a factor of @xmath28 at @xmath21 tev wimp mass ) than the rotated pixel method and the on / off method .",
    "however , the sensitivity of the driftscan method can be increased compared to the result shown in fig .",
    "[ sensi ] when the size of the driftscan background region is increased at the cost of the size of the signal region . in an optimized signal to background region size case the sensitivity of the driftscan method agrees with the sensitivity of the on / off and rotated pixel method within @xmath34 . +",
    "overall it can be stated that the increase in sensitivity of background subtraction methods alternative to the rotated pixel method is not as large as could be expected .",
    "the reason for this is the large amount of observation time that the alternative background subtraction methods need only for background observations . on the other hand ,",
    "it is obvious that the alternative background subtraction methods can be sensitive to a wimp annihilation @xmath4-ray flux even in the case when the dark matter density profile is for some reason nearly constant in the vicinity of the milky way halo center but only decreasing at large distances to the galactic center .",
    "additionally , the sensitivity of the driftscan and on / off method is larger than the sensitivity of the rotated pixel method if the center of the milky way dark matter halo is not spatially coincident with the galactic center but offset by @xmath35 as possibly indicated in @xcite . in conclusion it is ( despite of the sensitivity to the discussed benchmark model with an einasto dark matter density profile being comparable to the rotated pixel technique ) of interest to record at least a limited amount of observational data with the discussed observation strategies",
