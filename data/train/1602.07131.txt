    "the theory of estimation is at the heart of modern quantum sensing @xcite",
    ". quantum estimation , which employs quantum states to estimate unknown parameters , can be divided into state estimation and channel estimation problems . in state estimation problem",
    ", the state is parametrized by the unknown parameter , which is estimated by subjecting it to quantum measurements .",
    "this is contrasted against channel estimation , where a quantum channel is parametrized by a set of unknown parameters .",
    "such an estimation problem is approached by choosing a set of optimal input states , and subjecting the states that are output by the channel to measurements . to compare two designs of quantum sensors",
    ", we must employ a figure of merit that estimates how well a given strategy of parameter estimation is doing . a commonly used figure of merit",
    "is the uncertainty of the estimated parameter , denoted by @xmath0 .",
    "if we imagine an optical interferometric setup , the so - called _ standard quantum limit _ refers to strategies wherein the uncertainty scales inversely with the square - root of the average number of photons in the input state , namely @xmath1 .",
    "the chosen figure of merit is often studied under some constraints on the physical system .",
    "we note that there are several different constraints of the problem of parameter estimation that have been studied in the literature .",
    "the maximum photon number and the average photon number are examples of quantities which have been constrained by metrology schemes @xcite . likewise non - linear hamiltonians have been investigated and in the context of quantum enhanced metrology @xcite .",
    "some authors have estimated the uncertainty of estimation by using the noise - to - signal ratio .",
    "however , it was noted that this definition is unsatisfactory for multimodal probability distributions @xcite .",
    "another common choice of uncertainty that has been studied is the cramr - rao bound ( crb ) which specifies the error bound .",
    "however , it does not work properly in the unitary estimation because any estimation strategy can not saturate the crb while it can be saturated by two - step strategies in the state estimation and the noisy channel estimation @xcite .    in this manuscript",
    ", we clarify the reason why a two - step strategy can saturate the crb in the state estimation and the noisy channel estimation and it fails to saturate it in unitary ( noiseless ) estimation problems .",
    "this discussion shows why the n00n state does not work for unitary estimation in practice nevertheless its importance is widely believed . to obtain the truly attainable bound under the energy constraint , we convert the minimization problem of the average errors to another simple problem in the asymptotic regime . using squeezing operation , as an implementable solution in quantum optical system",
    ", we propose a concrete protocol for parameter estimation with quadratic enhancement with respect to the constrained energy @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , we also propose an experimental scheme to generate the optimal states used in the protocol .",
    "crb relates the uncertainty in the estimate of an unbiased estimator to the so - called fisher information @xcite .",
    "the quantum crb reads @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the quantum fisher information .",
    "we emphasize that crb , and its quantum generalizations , apply only asymptotically , in the limit of infinitely many repetitions @xmath5 of independent measurements . whether a calculated asymptotic minimum can be attained via implementable optimal measurements has been investigated by many authors .",
    "qcrb bound has been often criticized as being an unphysical bound , since it is only valid for local estimation .",
    "that is , the optimal measurement to attain the above bound depends on the true parameter to be estimated . to overcome this problem ,",
    "the two - step strategy @xcite is employed .    the mean - square error associated with state estimation",
    "is given by @xmath6 the infimum of @xmath7 over all measurements @xmath8 is a measure of the ultimate precision achievable by the setup described in figure ( 1.b ) .",
    "since the estimator is assumed to be unbiased , we have to impose the additional condition @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the set of allowed values of @xmath11 .",
    "this condition is too restrictive , since there are often no measurements that can satisfy this condition of being globally unbiased .",
    "hence , we can modify the condition to be locally unbiased , by demanding that the above equation be true with the first order taylor expansion at a given value @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the optimal locally unbiased estimator can be used in a two - step strategy to estimate the unknown parameter such that the mse saturates the crb as follows @xcite . in the two - step strategy",
    ", we first get the estimate @xmath13 for the unknown global parameter by employing the first @xmath14 copies of the state . in the second step ,",
    "we apply the optimal locally unbiased estimator at @xmath13 for remaining @xmath15 copies to refine the estimate .",
    "when @xmath13 falls in a ball of radius @xmath16 about the true parameter , the mse is sufficiently close to the crb .",
    "since the radius @xmath16 does not depend on the numbers @xmath14 and @xmath17 , the first estimate @xmath13 falls in the ball of radius @xmath16 with almost probability 1 as @xmath14 is sufficiently large .",
    "hence , for state estimation , this strategy saturates the crb .",
    "that is , the crb is considered to express the ultimate bound for precision of state estimation @xcite .",
    "this is not true for unitary estimation , as discussed below .",
    "in the unitary estimation , fig .",
    "( 1.b ) , to estimate the parameter @xmath11 parameterizing the unknown unitary @xmath18 we can choose the input state @xmath19 as well as the measurement @xmath8 .",
    "hence , we denote the mse by @xmath20 .",
    "when we choose the input state @xmath19 , we have state family @xmath21 , whose the quantum fisher information at @xmath22 is denoted by @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "it is known that n00n states realize the maximum quantum fisher information @xmath24 $ ] , which scales as @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "hence , it is believed that n00n states attain the inverse of this maximum @xcite . even in the case of n00n states",
    ", we note that the original scheme for enhanced lithography @xcite was criticized as being impractical @xcite . in appendix",
    "[ a3 ] , we formally show that the crb can not produce any bound for unitary estimation .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , the crb can not be saturated by any operation , i.e. , any pair of input state and measurement .",
    "since the two - step strategy outlined in fig  ( 1.c ) seems to saturate it even in unitary estimation , we demonstrate how the two - step strategy can not achieve the crb in the unitary estimation .",
    "similar to state estimation , the optimal input state and the optimal measurement depend on the true parameter @xmath11 , and are denoted by @xmath26 and @xmath27 . in the first step , we obtain the tentative estimate @xmath13 by employing @xmath14 copies . then , the second step is @xmath28 , whose error is evaluated as follows . for every @xmath29 and @xmath30",
    ", we choose the error bar @xmath31 with a suitable choice of the constant @xmath32 .",
    "then , @xmath33 implies that @xmath34 \\leq   m^2   \\left(\\max_{|\\psi\\rangle } { \\cal f}^{(m)}_{\\theta_0}[|\\psi\\rangle]\\right)^{-1 } + \\varepsilon.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the meaning of the above equation is as follows : if @xmath35 , then the lhs of the equation above achieves the crb .",
    "the equation is normalized by @xmath36 because @xmath37 .",
    "unfortunately , this condition is satisfied only with the probability @xmath38 .",
    "although @xmath16 behaves as @xmath39 , the error @xmath40 in the first step behaves as @xmath41 . in the limit @xmath42 , this probability becomes very small .",
    "hence the crb given above can not be attained by the two - step method .",
    "that is , in the unitary estimation , the crb can not be used as a figure of merit .",
    "we note that when the target to be estimated is noisy channel , the above two - step strategy works well @xcite .",
    "three different metrology schemes are presented , namely ( a ) state estimation problem , where a parametrized state is to be determined , ( b ) single step unitary estimation , where an initial state is entangled and then subjected to a unknown unitary , followed by measurements , and ( c ) a two - step strategy where a subset of the the initial states are used to estimate the neighbourhood of the true parameter , and the rest of the states are used to perform an adaptive measurement to estimate the unknown parameter @xmath11.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    to overcome this problem , we need to seek another figure of merit .",
    "although in the above we have discussed the case when the unknown unitary is given as @xmath43 copies of a given unknown unitary , we will consider a more physical situation to discuss the parameter estimation problem .",
    "it is natural that the unknown parameter is the phase parameter acquired by the hamiltonian . in optical system ,",
    "the hamiltonian is given by the number operator @xmath44 , and the initial state is considered to be @xmath45 , whose coefficients we will determine , for optimal performance . in order to avoid the ambiguity caused by the periodicity , we employ the error function @xmath46 .",
    "this error function is approximately quadratic for small values and zero when @xmath47 is close to @xmath22 . the average error is then defined as @xmath48 for a physically reasonable constraint for input states , we constrain the energy of the state , namely @xmath49 because it bounds the error function in terms of the energy resources employed in the metrology scheme .",
    "energy constraint @xcite is one of the few important resource constraints @xcite considered in quantum metrology . with this constraint",
    ", the minimum error , which is a good figure of merit for metrological tasks , can be written as @xmath50 in this scenario , the resource that is varied is the fixed value of @xmath2 instead of the number of copies .",
    "using the figure of merit derived above , we now derive an attainable limit in the limit of large energy @xmath2 .",
    "since the error function has a group covariant form , we can restrict our measurement , without loss of generality , to a covariant measurement @xcite , namely @xmath51e^{i\\hat{n}\\theta_{\\rm est}}\\frac{d\\theta_{\\rm est}}{2\\pi}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally , we notice that @xmath52 can be split into two non - interacting parts @xmath53 and @xmath54 , corresponding to even and odd parity sectors of the state @xmath55 . here",
    "@xmath56 and likewise @xmath57 .",
    "we can hence deal with the parity sectors separately .",
    "such good parity states and operators have already been shown to be advantageous in quantum metrology schemes @xcite . to address the optimization in the asymptotic regime , consider a square integrable function @xmath58 on @xmath59 with the existence of the limit @xmath60 .",
    "such a function will serve as continuous generalizations of the discrete coefficients @xmath61 .",
    "we then define the input state @xmath62 . here",
    "@xmath63 is the function , normalized so that the total probability is still unity .",
    "since we have @xmath64 by using the position operator @xmath65 , we discuss the asymptotic regime @xmath66 by increasing @xmath67 .",
    "then , the error function @xmath68 can be simplified to @xmath69 by using the momentum operator @xmath70 .",
    "we note that the first term can be ignored in the limit of large @xmath67 if @xmath71 , a condition that will be employed below .",
    "this means that @xmath72    a similar equation can be shown to hold true for the odd states .",
    "while @xcite showed @xmath73 , taking these two cases into account , we can asymptotically characterize the minimum error @xmath74 as @xmath75 where the lower bound is shown to hold in appendix [ a2 ] .",
    "in the optimal case , we can hence realize the quadratic enhancement where the error scales inversely with the square of the energy .",
    "hence , the minimum value on the right hand side gives the truly attainable bound instead of the crb .",
    "since this optimization is difficult in general , we handle the optimization program by restricting ourselves to the class of square integrable functions @xmath76 with @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the gamma function @xcite and seek an analytical solution .",
    "such a form for @xmath79 is motivated from the facts that ( a ) the functional value at @xmath80 should be zero , and ( b ) the function should be square integrable and normalized to unity . in this case , the two quantities @xmath81 and @xmath82^{-1}$ ] can be evaluated . the second term is made finite by demanding that @xmath83 .",
    "now , we obtain an attainable error coefficient , which is the product prescribed in eq.([basic_form ] ) and is calculated to be @xmath84 $ ]",
    ". the minimum value , for the constraint @xmath83 , is realized at @xmath85 .",
    "below , we consider the suboptimization accompanying squeezing transformations and its physical generation , which are implementable as the metrological scheme .",
    "this is because squeezing transformations are implemented routinely in quantum optics experiments . by using the annihilation and creation operators @xmath86 and @xmath87 , the squeezing operator is given as @xmath88)$ ] , where @xmath89 is related to the squeezing parameter @xmath90 by the relation @xmath91 , with @xmath92 .",
    "we optimize the input state among superposition of squeezed number states because several authors have considered superpositions of squeezed states with other states , such as thermal states @xcite and squeezing applied to superpositions of coherent states .",
    "such studies have focused on the non - classical properties of the resulting quantum states , and their applications to quantum metrology @xcite .",
    "the motivation for considering superpositions of squeezed states follows from the parity separation of the optimal states because squeezing transformation commutes with the projection operators on both the even and odd sectors @xcite .",
    "as shown in appendix [ a5 ] , when we increase the constraint @xmath2 by increasing the parameter @xmath93 , the state @xmath94 can be realized by superpositions of squeezed photon number states if and only if @xmath95 . the minimum of , when we restrict ourselves to such a subset , is achieved at @xmath96 .",
    "we note that such a state is given by @xmath97 , where @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "next , we show how to generate the suboptimal state @xmath101 we have derived here by using squeezing transformations @xcite . since both single - mode and two - mode squeezing transformations are routinely implemented in laboratories , these transformations can produce the suboptimal state @xmath101 .",
    "such states can be produced by first producing a superposition of states , using two - mode squeezed vacuum states as shown below , followed by injection of these states into a degenerate parametric down - converter that implements the squeezing transformation on arbitrary input states .",
