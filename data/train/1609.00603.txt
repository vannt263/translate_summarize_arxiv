    "<S> involved computations are then required to give the explicit expression of the reynolds stress . </S>",
    "<S> let us just mention that the difficulty comes from the fact that we have to take the limit @xmath56 first in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : inhomogeneous rayleigh ] ) before @xmath32 </S>",
    "<S> . then we can relate @xmath57 to the laplace transform @xmath58 taken at @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> again , the asymptotic expansion for @xmath60 requires the condition that @xmath61 is large . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , there exists a small region of size @xmath49 around the maximum where the asymptotic expansion breaks down . in the outer region away from the extrema , we recover the expression ( [ eq : reynolds stress ] ) in the inertial limit @xmath31 first . for strictly monotonic </S>",
    "<S> velocity profiles @xmath3 , we conclude that the inertial limit and the small scale forcing limit commute and the universal expression ( [ eq : reynolds stress ] ) is expected to be valid .    </S>",
    "<S> using expression ( [ eq : reynolds stress ] ) for the reynolds stress , we can solve eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : quasilinear ] ) for the stationary profile . </S>",
    "<S> it writes @xmath62 whatever the value of the free parameter @xmath41 , all profiles @xmath3 are diverging in finite length . </S>",
    "<S> an example of such a profile @xmath3 is given on fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig : divergence ] ) . in red </S>",
    "<S> , we have plotted different solutions of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : diverging solution ] ) together such that the mean velocity profile @xmath3 is composed of many diverging jets . in blue , </S>",
    "<S> we have drawn at hand what we expect qualitatively from a real velocity profile . </S>",
    "<S> an example of a real profile obtained by numerical simulations in @xcite is displayed on fig.([fig : numerics ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that both divergences are regularized , by a cusp at the eastward jet maximum , and by a parabolic profile at the westward jet minimum . </S>",
    "<S> the second aim of this paper is to explain the asymmetric regularization of the eastward and westward jets respectively .    0.25 ) ( red curve ) together with a qualitative real velocity profile ( blue curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) real velocity profile obtained in numerical simulations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the analytic solution for @xmath3 has divergences at the extrema that are regularized by a cusp at the eastward jet and a parabola at the westward jet.,title=\"fig : \" ]    0.25 ) ( red curve ) together with a qualitative real velocity profile ( blue curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) real velocity profile obtained in numerical simulations @xcite . the analytic solution for @xmath3 has divergences at the extrema that are regularized by a cusp at the eastward jet and a parabola at the westward jet.,title=\"fig : \" ]    numerical simulations like the one performed on fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig : numerics ] ) show that the mean velocity profile is regularized at a very small scale at its maximum . as we explained already previously </S>",
    "<S> , there exists a region of typical size @xmath49 around the maximum where the asymptotic expansion for the reynolds stress breaks down . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus natural to choose the ansatz @xmath63 the scaling in @xmath49 implies that the ratio @xmath64 is very large at the cusp because @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant equation we have to use to describe the cusp is the inhomogeneous rayleigh eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : inhomogeneous rayleigh ] ) . if we put the ansatz @xmath66 in ( [ eq : inhomogeneous rayleigh ] ) and consider the limit of large @xmath17 , we get @xmath67where @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the solution of this equation with @xmath56 gives us the laplace transform of the stream function with which we can express the reynolds stress . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-effect disappears completely from the equation of the cusp because in the region of the cusp , the curvature is so large that it overcomes completely the @xmath0-effect , as can be seen on the green curve of fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig : numerics ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : rayleigh cusp ] ) together with the equations linking the reynolds stress with @xmath60 have a numerical solution , which proves that our scaling @xmath69 is self - consistent . </S>",
    "<S> this solution can not be expressed analytically and depends on the fourier spectrum of the stochastic forcing . </S>",
    "<S> an example of a numerical integration of the reynolds stress divergence @xmath70 for the cusp is displayed on fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig : tenseur cusp ] ) for @xmath71 and a stochastic forcing with a semi annular fourier spectrum where @xmath72 ranges between @xmath73 and @xmath74 .     </S>",
    "<S> ( blue curve ) computed for a parabolic profile @xmath71 around its maximum @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> it is satisfying to observe that the red curve @xmath76 matches the blue curve for large @xmath77 according to the universal expression ( [ eq : reynolds stress]).[fig : tenseur cusp ] ]    on fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig : tenseur cusp ] ) , the red curve is the asymptote @xmath76 obtained from formula ( [ eq : reynolds stress ] ) with @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> when a jet is in a stationary state , the cusp profile joins smoothly the outer region of the jet where the universal result ( [ eq : reynolds stress ] ) is valid .    </S>",
    "<S> another physical phenomenon at the maximum of the jet is called `` depletion at the stationary streamlines '' and has first been observed in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it means that at critical latitudes where @xmath79 , any vorticity perturbation of the flow @xmath80 has to asymptotically vanish with time . </S>",
    "<S> one main consequence of this phenomenon is the relation @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the latitude of the extremum . </S>",
    "<S> from ( [ eq : curvature ] ) we learn that , even if the velocity profile of the cusp is not universal , the maximal curvature of the profile satisfies a universal relation , and it would therefore be very interesting to check it in full numerical simulations with different types of forcing spectra .    </S>",
    "<S> the previous discussion successfully explained the jet regularization of the eastward jet cusp . </S>",
    "<S> as clearly observed on fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig : numerics ] ) , and on jupiter data , westward jets do not produce cusps . at first sight </S>",
    "<S> , it may seem that all the theoretical arguments used so far , the energy balance , the asymptotic expansions , and the results ( [ eq : reynolds stress ] ) and ( [ eq : curvature ] ) , do not break the symmetry between eastward and westward jets , as @xmath0 disappears from all these computations . </S>",
    "<S> however , as clearly stressed in  @xcite , the whole theoretical approach relies on an assumption of hydrodynamic stability for @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetry is clearly visible in the rayleigh - kuo criterion , that states that when @xmath83 change sign , an instability may develop . </S>",
    "<S> we will now argue that the turbulent flow is constantly oscillating between a stable and unstable solution , in order to control the westward jet behavior .    </S>",
    "<S> to check this marginal stability hypothesis , we solved numerically the homogeneous pde for a perturbation carried by a mean flow @xmath84 we chose a parabolic mean velocity with a small perturbation at its minimum @xmath85 the main curvature @xmath86 is chosen to be slightly smaller than @xmath0 , and we performed simulations using different values of @xmath87 and @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> we check that the growth rate of the perturbation is indeed exponential with time with a complex rate @xmath89 . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we gave a global consistent picture of how a zonal jet is sustained in a steady state through continuous energy transfer from small scale to large scale , from first principles . </S>",
    "<S> extension and generalizations of our approach can be foreseen for other geometries ( on the sphere ) , for more comprehensive quasi - geostrophic models of atmosphere jets , and for classes of flows dominated by a strong mean jet , for instance in some instances of boundary layer theory . </S>"
