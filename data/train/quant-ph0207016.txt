    "quantum interference is one of the most intriguing phenomena of quantum mechanics . over the past decade",
    "several effects in atom - light interaction which have their origin in quantum interference have been predicted and demonstrated experimentally @xcite .",
    "some characteristic examples are reduction and cancellation of absorption @xcite and spontaneous emission @xcite , and narrow resonances in fluorescence @xcite .",
    "a prerequisite of quantum interference between the transition channels is the existence of some stable time correlation of the atomic system under consideration .",
    "a possible way of achieving such correlation is the application of coherent coupling in a multi - level atomic system .",
    "although some interference effects have also been found in two - level systems interacting with two light beams @xcite , so far quantum interference has been observed exclusively in at least three - level systems .",
    "generally , various incoherent perturbations destroy the phase correlation between the states involved in the interfering transition pathways and the coherently induced quantum interference disappears .",
    "however , under special circumstances , even incoherent perturbation can be responsible for quantum interference .",
    "for example , quantum interference can appear in three - level systems due to collisions .",
    "such effects are known as pressure - induced extra resonances and have been studied in four - wave mixing@xcite .",
    "recently , in an experiment with coherently driven two - level atoms , anomalous resonance fluorescence spectra were found when the collisional relaxation rate exceeded the rabi frequency @xcite .",
    "the spectra were of the form of a pressure - broadened line with a narrow , not collisionally broadened dip .",
    "these results , unexpected in a collisionally perturbed two - level system , were interpreted as a consequence of quantum interference between different dressed - state transition channels . in ref.@xcite , it was pointed out that these effects can also occur in the case of a non - monochromatic , e.g. phase - diffusing , laser field . indeed , resonance fluorescence spectra with the phase - diffusing laser field have been calculated by peng zhou et al .",
    "@xcite who obtained the same results as gawlik et al .",
    "what in both cases appears essential for observation of quantum interference and anomalous spectra is that the incoherent perturbation ( collisions or phase diffusion of the light field ) dominates over the rabi oscillations .",
    "these two examples raise an intriguing question how can a stochastic noise lead to stable time correlation resulting in quantum interference in two - level systems .",
    "quantum trajectory methods are widely used powerful tools for treating the stochastic evolution of open quantum systems @xcite .",
    "they can provide the solution of any master equation that is of lindblad form @xcite .",
    "moreover , individual quantum trajectories , as state evolutions conditioned on particular sequence of observed events , make it possible to reveal phase correlations in the given system .",
    "while resonance fluorescence spectra can be adequately modeled by the master equation , we find the use of quantum trajectories provides more physical insight .",
    "besides , this method allows to study the stochastic evolution of the atomic system and , eventually , reveal the phase correlation of its dressed states .",
    "for that reason , in this paper we analyze in detail the system of stochastically perturbed two - level atoms applying both the master equation and the quantum trajectory method to explain quantum interference effects and the underlying physical processes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : model ] we introduce our model for the system of a coherently driven and incoherently perturbed two - level atom . in section [ sec : numsim ] the method of quantum trajectories is applied to the system and a new method is developed for calculating the spectrum from the simulation results .",
    "section [ sec : fluor ] presents the numerical results for the spectra and compares them with the analytical solution of the master equation . in section [ sec : phase ] the phase difference between the dressed states of an atom is analyzed and the phase correlation is revealed .",
    "it is shown that the phase correlation emerges as the noise magnitude increases and the related quantum interference effect is discussed .",
    "the system of incoherently perturbed and coherently driven two - level atoms can be modeled in several ways . here",
    "we make a rather general assumption that the stochastic perturbation is responsible for fluctuations of the atomic resonance frequency which obeys the gaussian statistics . in particular",
    ", such fluctuations may result from e.g. elastic , dephasing collisions .    in our model the hamiltonian of the strongly , coherently driven atom subjected to stochastic perturbation has the form @xmath0 in the interaction picture , where @xmath1 is the fluctuating atomic transition frequency , @xmath2 is the frequency of the laser , @xmath3 the rabi frequency , and @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 are the atomic operators defined in the excited state ( @xmath7 )  ground state ( @xmath8 ) basis : @xmath9 we assume that the noise in the transition frequency satisfies @xmath10 where @xmath11 stands for the magnitude of the stochastic noise .",
    "if the noise is due to collisions , this quantity is the collision rate between the atoms .",
    "this model can also describe the system of two level atoms driven by a laser field with fluctuating phase , if the phase drift is neglected @xcite .",
    "in such case , @xmath11 represents the laser linewidth .",
    "the time - evolution of the system defined by the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hami ] ) is described by the following master equation , taking into account also the spontaneous emission processes : @xmath12+l\\rho,\\ ] ] where    @xmath13    and @xmath14 is the mean atomic hamiltonian obtained by averaging over the stochastic noise of eq .",
    "( [ noise ] ) , and @xmath15 is the natural linewidth of the atom .",
    "it is natural to introduce the dressed - state basis in which the atomic hamiltonian @xmath16 is diagonal :    @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the laser detuning .    the mean atomic hamiltonian @xmath14 in the dressed - state basis @xmath19 , @xmath20 can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22    the effect of incoherent perturbation on the pure states can be determined from the lindblad form ( [ eq : lindbladstoch ] ) of the master equation in eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) .",
    "the action of the operator @xmath23 corresponds to an event generated by the stochastic noise . without detuning",
    ", this operator generates transitions between the dressed states @xmath19 and @xmath20 :    [ eq : dressedtime ] @xmath24    another way of observing the effect of the stochastic noise is to transform the time - dependent hamiltonian in the langevin equation into the dressed - state basis .",
    "this must be done carefully since parameter @xmath25 in the definition of the dressed states becomes time - dependent in this case :    @xmath26    to the first order in @xmath27 .",
    "hamiltonian @xmath16 is diagonal in the time - dependent dressed - state basis , thus @xmath28 this also shows that the stochastic noise generates transitions between the dressed states @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the master equation has the following form in the dressed - state basis :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 are the matrix elements of the density operator in the dressed - state basis .",
    "the matrix element @xmath34 is the complex conjugate of @xmath33 , as @xmath36 is hermitian . for resonant excitation ( @xmath37 ) the stochastic noise couples the @xmath19 and @xmath20 states and increases the relaxation rate of the spin @xmath38 component . in this case",
    "the dressed states become independent of the rabi frequency , and eq .",
    "( [ master1 ] ) is uncoupled from eq .",
    "( [ master2 ] ) .",
    "this is however not the case in the general , non - resonant case .",
    "in the system of coherently driven stochastically perturbed two - level atoms , quantum interference effects can be seen in the resonance fluorescence spectra @xcite .",
    "the resonance fluorescence can be described by transitions between appropriate dressed states of the atom .",
    "if spectral modifications are due to quantum interference , some time correlation should exist between the dressed states of the atom involved in the interfering transition channels .    for analyzing time correlations in a quantum system ,",
    "quantum trajectory methods are particularly appropriate .",
    "these methods are based on the simulation of quantum trajectories , that are individual realizations of the evolution of the system conditioned on particular sequence of observed events . by tracking the time evolution of a single quantum trajectory , the time correlations can be revealed .",
    "we apply the quantum trajectory method of ref .",
    "@xcite for simulating the time evolution of the coherently driven , stochastically perturbed two - level atom . in this system",
    ", a single quantum trajectory evolves coherently according to the hamiltonian of eq .",

    "measurements due to noise events and spontaneous emission .",
    "the evolution of the density operator of the system is obtained by averaging the density operators of the individual quantum trajectories .",
    "the resulting density operator is the solution of the master equation of eq .",

    "@xmath41 should be much less than the characteristic time of any process in the system .",
    "@xmath40 should be large enough to obtain the right ensemble averages for the density operator at the given stochastic noise magnitude . in our simulations @xmath40 was approximately @xmath42 .    within dipole approximation",
    "the resonance fluorescence spectrum @xmath43 can be calculated as the real part of the two - time correlation function @xmath44 for an arbitrary initial condition : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the detuning of the emitted light from @xmath2 .",
    "there are different methods in the literature for obtaining the spectrum using a numerical simulation @xcite .",
    "one kind of them simulates not only the atom but also the quantized electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "such methods seem to be excessive when the field can be treated classically .    the method presented by dalibard et al .",
    "@xcite simulates only the atom , and obtains the spectrum by calculating two - time averages and taking their fourier - transform .",
    "the computation time of this method increases as @xmath47 , where @xmath41 is the time step of the simulation , because for each time step an additional simulation is started to calculate the two - time averages . that can be time consuming in the case when large number of quantum trajectories are simulated and small time steps are used .",
    "this is the situation in our problem when we simulate the system in the high noise magnitude regime .",
    "the question arises whether it is possible to develop a method which simulates only the atom , without the need of starting extra simulations for calculating the two - time averages .",
    "below , we briefly outline the essentials of our novel method for spectrum calculation .",
    "more details will be published elsewhere .",

    "the analytical and numerical results are in very good agreement as one can see in the presented figures which positively verifies correctness of our numerical simulations .",
    "the narrow dip in the spectrum ( in the case of high noise magnitude , resonant excitation ) and the asymmetric fano profile ( in the case of large detuning and high noise magnitude ) are signatures of quantum interference in the stochastically perturbed system .",

    ", @xmath121 remains uncorrelated .",
    "this means that the phase difference is locked to values @xmath83 and @xmath115 for some time intervals , though it spans a phase interval no less than @xmath125 around these phase values .",
    "it is interesting that the widths of the correlation functions are related with the observed narrow dips in the spectra .",

    "[ fig : fwhm ] .",
    "the fwhm of @xmath122 is roughly proportional to the reciprocal of the width of the dip in the spectrum across a wide range of parameter sets , so the observed phase correlation is indeed responsible for the narrowness of the dip in the spectrum .",
    "the stabilization of the phase difference between the dressed states of the stochastically perturbed and coherently driven two - level atom is the underlying physical process which makes the quantum interference possible .",
    "this stabilization supports the following interpretation first suggested for collisional and phase noise - induced quantum interference effects in resonance fluorescence spectrum in ref .",

    "there are two pairs : @xmath128 and @xmath129 ( or @xmath130 and @xmath131 ) that differ exclusively by time ordering between collisional mixing and photon emissions .",
    "photons emitted along these channels are indistinguishable , so their interference is possible . due to opposite signs of the relevant matrix elements this interference is destructive and creates a dip in the line center . on the other hand , other emission channels are not that equivalent , hence the corresponding photons can not interfere and contribute to non - zero intensity at @xmath132 .",
    "this interference is similar to that seen by schrama et al .",
    "@xcite in photon correlations of the well resolved mollow triplet components in the opposite limit when @xmath133 .",
    "we have applied the quantum trajectory method to the system of two - level atoms strongly driven by a coherent light field and perturbed by stochastic noise .",
    "we have developed a new method for obtaining the resonance fluorescence spectra from numerical simulations .",
    "this method is especially advantageous for physical systems where the noise dominates the dynamics , and one needs to simulate many quantum trajectories using small time steps .",
    "the simulation of a single quantum trajectory revealed that for high noise magnitude the phase difference between the dressed states tends to stabilize around fixed values . when calculating the resonance fluorescence spectra , narrow resonances as central dip and dispersive fano - like profile occurred in the regime where the noise dominated the rabi oscillations .",
