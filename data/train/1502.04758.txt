    "persistent random walks have been proposed as models for a wealth of physical and biological systems @xcite . in the simplest scenario ,",
    "this process is characterized by the tendency to continue moving in the direction of the last step . in certain circumstances",
    ", this tendency can be thought of a kind of inertial effect that keeps the particle moving in the direction of motion @xcite . on the other hand , in the context of biology",
    ", the tendency may arise from the fact that animals move in the direction in which they are facing @xcite .",
    "for one dimensional systems the probability distribution function for the position of the walker independent of the direction it is moving , satisfies the telegrapher s equation in the continuous limit @xcite . in two dimensions , the probability distribution function for the position of the walker can be shown to satisfy a telegrapher s equation only approximately , and little is known for three and higher dimensions @xcite . however , in all cases , the net effect of persistence is that it induces a short term memory in the motion in the sense that the direction of the path is closely related to previous directions over a correlation time , but in the long run , the transport process remains diffusive .",
    "an interesting generalization of this process is the case in which the tendency to move is not in the same direction as the previous step , but rather , at a fixed deviation from the previous direction . in two dimensions",
    ", this modification induces a tendency to `` loop '' if , say , the direction of each step is narrowly centered at a fixed , non zero angle from the previous step .",
    "this modification was shown to give rise to nonmonotonic behavior of the walker s effective diffusion constant as a function of the width of the distribution of angle changes @xcite .",
    "for very small widths , the walker would perform many loops that brought it back close to it s initial position and , thus , giving rise to small diffusion .",
    "if , on the other hand , the distribution is very broad , then the persistence effects are quickly lost and the process is essentially a normal random walk . however , between both limits , large loop segments can become uncorrelated before returning near the starting point , giving rise to a large effective diffusion coefficient @xcite .    in this work",
    "we address the three dimensional case , namely we study the transport properties of persistent diffusion with curvature and torsion .",
    "this three dimensional motion induces a tendency for the trajectories to spiral , a behavior that has been observed in many animals ``  helical trajectories are nearly universal for organisms that are less than 0.5 mm long and live in water . ''",
    "@xcite    further , in spite of its limitations , persistent random walks are useful models for the shape of linear polymers with some degree of bond rigidity ; thus persistent diffusion with curvature and torsion would be appropriate models for polymers that tend to form helices @xcite .",
    "as in @xcite , we formulate the problem in terms of the frenet  serret equations with noise terms added to the curvature and torsion .",
    "we then construct a fokker ",
    "planck equation @xcite for this process , from which we can calculate the correlation functions of the frenet frame . in particular , we can evaluate the velocity autocorrelation function from which the effective diffusion constant of the process is obtained .",
    "to formulate the persistent diffusive process , we consider the frenet description of a trajectory @xcite , which consists in the evolution of the right handed frame of unit vectors given by @xmath0 , the vector tangent to the curve , the normal @xmath1 , in the direction of the derivative of @xmath0 , and the binormal @xmath2 . the frenet ",
    "serret equations then state that @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the arclength , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the curvature and torsion of the curve respectively , which can , in principle , depend on @xmath4 too . the time evolution of the particle following the trajectory is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the speed of the particle , which we will take as a constant throughout this work ..    to simplify the construction of the fokker ",
    "planck equation , we begin by discretizing the frenet  serret equation as follows .",
    "we write the arclength as @xmath9 and take the following discretized version of the evolution equation : @xmath10 where @xmath11 the rationale for this choice is that at each step , the frenet frame undergoes a pure rotation .",
    "equivalently , inverting eq.([discfrenet ] ) we have @xmath12 finally , we introduce noise by taking @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 will be assumed to be constant , while @xmath16 and @xmath17 are random variables satisfying @xmath18 to order @xmath19 we can evaluate the matrix @xmath20 as follows @xmath21 where the @xmath22-dependencies have been suppressed from the last expression in the interest of typographical clarity .",
    "thus , if we denote @xmath23 the probability density function for the frenet frame being given by the vectors @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath24 at step @xmath22 , then , correct to order @xmath19 , we derive the fokker ",
    "planck equation from the relation @xmath25 here the angular brackets denote the average over the random noise @xmath16 and @xmath17 and @xmath26 is as in ( [ eq : rnapprox ] ) .    to lighten the expressions to come ,",
    "let us now define the drifts @xmath27 [ eq : drifts ] putting in ( [ eq : master ] ) , @xmath28 , with @xmath9 , expanding to linear order in @xmath19 and finally dividing by @xmath19 , we obtain @xmath29\\nonumber\\\\ \\quad-\\sum\\limits_i\\sum\\limits_j \\left[\\sigma_1 ^",
    "2n_it_j \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial t_i\\partial n_j } + \\sigma_2 ^ 2n_ib_j \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial b_i\\partial n_j}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote the gradient in the @xmath6 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 coordinates respectively .",
    "the equation above describes the evolution of the probability distribution for the components of the frenet frame along the arclength of the particle s trajectory and becomes exact in the limit @xmath35 .",
    "equation ( [ fp ] ) can be rewritten in a slightly more symmetric form as @xmath36 either way , the equation seems to be rather intractable .",
    "however , it can be used to study the evolution of the moments of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath24 ; from these , the transport properties of @xmath37 can be inferred . in particular , by carrying out the integrations , one finds that @xmath38/2 & \\tau \\\\    0 & -\\tau & -\\sigma_2 ^ 2/2 \\\\",
    "\\end{array }   \\begin{array}{ccc }   \\langle { \\hat t}_s|{\\hat t_0,\\hat n_0 , \\hat b_0 } \\rangle \\\\",
    "\\langle { \\hat n}_s|{\\hat t_0,\\hat n_0 , \\hat b_0 } \\rangle \\\\   \\langle { \\hat b}_s|{\\hat t_0,\\hat n_0 , \\hat b_0 } \\rangle \\\\   \\end{array }   \\right ) .",
    "\\label{means}\\ ] ] here the dependence on the initial condition has been written explicitly to emphasize the fact that these statistics give us access to the time correlation functions .",
    "the solution can be written as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the matrix appearing in eq.([means ] ) .",
    "thus , the matrix of correlation functions can be written explicitly as @xmath41 the laplace - fourier transform of the correlation matrix is thus given by @xmath42 if we now define @xmath43 as follows @xmath44 we find the matrix @xmath45 to be given by @xmath46 note that the matrix is not symmetric as the process is not invariant under simple time inversion .",
    "rather , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are odd , whereas @xmath49 is even , leading to the observed alternation between symmetric and antisymmetric elements in the matrix .",
    "the explicit inversion of the above results to obtain the time - dependent correlation functions can , of course , be carried out in principle , as it only requires the solution of a third order polynomial . nevertheless , the results are messy and unenlightening . instead , we focus on particular cases which illustrate different aspects of the process .",
    "one simple situation is reached in the planar case , in which both the torsion @xmath15 and its associated noise vanish ( @xmath50 ) . in this case , the binormal vector is constant and the motion is restricted to a plane . in this situation , ( [ 3dmatrix ] ) simplifies to @xmath51 where @xmath43 here reduces to @xmath52.\\ ] ] the @xmath4-dependent correlations can also be determined explicitly in this case .",
    "indeed one readily finds @xmath53 which corresponds to circular motion which is damped due to the noise .",
    "further , we can use @xmath54 to write the fourier - laplace transforms for the average of the frenet vectors ; for example , for the mean tangent vector we have : @xmath55\\nonumber\\\\ \\hat t_0 + 2k(\\sigma_2 ^ 2 + 2i\\omega)\\hat n_0 + 4k\\tau \\hat b_0 \\bigg\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this quantity connects to the behavior of the walker s average position by @xmath56 thus , in the long time limit , the average position of the persistent walker saturates at @xmath57 another interesting quantity is the darboux vector @xcite , which in our case , will be writen as @xmath58 .",
    "this vector is akin to the angular momentum of the walker . in the absence of noise",
    ", this vector is constant , as can be seen directly from ( [ means ] ) , and lies on the axis of the helical motion . in the presence of noise",
    ", however , the darboux vector evolves according to @xmath59\\vec a_0   + 2k\\tau \\left ( \\sigma_2 ^ 2-\\sigma_1 ^ 2 \\right )   \\hat n_0 \\bigg\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath60 is the initial value of @xmath61 .",
    "it is worth noting that in the small noise limit , the saturation value of the average position , given in ( [ posit ] ) is given by @xmath62 which reflects the intuitively appealing fact that in the low - noise limit , the net displacement is in the direction of the axis of the helix .    perhaps more interestingly , from the correlation functions we can compute the effective diffusion constant .",
    "assuming , again , that the instantaneous speed @xmath8 is constant , we can write @xmath63 recalling that @xmath64 . the effective diffusion constant @xmath65 will be given by @xmath66 this expression s behaviour becomes easier to visualize after introducing scaled versions of the curvature , the torsion and the diffusion constant as well as the adimensional parameter @xmath67 , which measures the relative importance of the curvature and the torsion : @xmath68 [ eq : scaled ] in terms of these parameters , ( [ eq : diff ] ) then reduces to @xmath69 thus @xmath70 grows with @xmath71 and decreases with @xmath72 .",
    "intuitively , this corresponds to the fact that torsion favors a rectilinear motion in the direction of the darboux vector , thus favouring diffusion by enhancing transport , whereas curvature leads to looping around in circles , which confines the walker s motion . for the true diffusion",
    "constant , matters are a bit more complex , since it depends really on three parameters .",
    "thus , for instance , upon increasing @xmath73 at fixed @xmath74that is , at fixed total noise  we decrease @xmath72 and thus increase @xmath70 . the behaviour of @xmath65 , however , is in general non - monotonic , since it corresponds to @xmath70 _ divided _ by @xmath75 .",
    "it is interesting to note that([eq : diff ] ) recovers the two - dimensional result taking the torsion @xmath76 first , simplifying and then @xmath77 .",
    "this procedure yields @xmath78 which is analogous to the result obtained in @xcite .",
    "we note that , as above , @xmath79 is a non monotonic function of @xmath73 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that a different , intrinsically three dimensional result , is obtained if we take the limits in opposite order . indeed ,",
    "if we let @xmath80 first , we see that @xmath81 and therefore @xmath82 which is independent of all the other parameters of the problem . from the scaling form ( [ eq : diff1 ] ) , it follows quite straightforwardly that the same result also holds if @xmath83 .",
    "intuitively , however , it is quite far from being obvious why , in the former case , the diffusion constant only depends on @xmath73 and @xmath8 .    indeed , it is quite clear that a non - trivial crossover behaviour must be observed when we have @xmath84 and @xmath15 small . in this case , we might have expected the behavior to be close to that for @xmath85 , yet the exact expressions for the diffusion constants differ by a finite amount .",
    "this means that , in this case , we shall observe two - dimensional diffusion for a long - time , and would expect to see the corresponding diffusion constant , see ( [ eq : diff2d ] ) over a limited time range .",
    "after that , we would expect torsion to bring the system significantly out of the plane , and thus to lead to the expression ( [ eq : diffweird ] ) .",
    "indeed , this can be verified by a straightforward though tedious analysis of the zeroes of @xmath43 .",
    "one finds a low - lying imaginary zero with the value @xmath86 which corroborates the picture    when @xmath83 , on the other hand , the tendency of the process is to move , on average , in the same direction of the previous motion , so that we have a typical persistent walk .",
    "the torsion , on the other hand , with or without noise , merely rotates the new step around the previous tangent and thus has no influence on the diffusive properties of the process .",
    "as a final remark , we observe a peculiar transition in the large - time behaviour of the average trajectory . indeed ,",
    "the average position of the trajectory at arclength @xmath4 is determined by the matrix @xmath87 . for large @xmath4 it",
    "must therefore be dominated by that eigenvalue of @xmath40 having the smalles real part in absolute value . as is readily seen ,",
    "the three eigenvalues of @xmath40 in the limit of small noise are given by @xmath88 [ eq : eigen ] up to terms of higher order in the noise .",
    "thus , in the low - noise limit , we have two groups of eigenvalues , one tending to @xmath89 and corresponding essentially to the darboux vector as an eigenvector .",
    "this thus describes the motion in the direction of the helix axis .",
    "the other two eigenvalues correspond to eigenvectors determining the rotational motion . as we see , their real parts are not equal , and an easy calculation shows that @xmath90 dominates if @xmath91 and @xmath92 otherwise .",
    "thus , according to the sign of @xmath93 , we have two qualitatively different motions : if @xmath94 , the circular motion decays more rapidly than the progressive motion , and the asymptotic shape of the particle s trajectory is a very loosely wound helical motion , in which the particle in one rotation advances by a distance far larger than the helix radius .",
    "if @xmath95 , on the other hand , the opposite situation prevails , and the motion is on a circle of a radius much larger than the distance by which the particle advances for each rotation . in other words , we might say that the asymptotic pitch of the average motion diverges at large times for @xmath94 , whereas it vanishes for @xmath95 .",
    "we show in figure 1 the autocorrelation function of the tangent vector @xmath47 for large times for 2 cases in which @xmath94 and @xmath95 respectively .",
    "the difference is quite striking .",
    "finally , let us point out that the above - mentioned transition does not always occur . in particular , if @xmath14 and @xmath15 are equal , or of similar size , then we always have @xmath94 .",
    "for both signs of @xmath93 to be possible , we require @xmath96 when @xmath97 , the model maintains a truly helicoidal dynamics for all times .",
    "it would be of interest to know whether any particular significance attaches to this fact in real systems .",
    "fig .  1 : the autocorrelatin function for @xmath47 for @xmath98 and @xmath99 in the cases where @xmath100 ( upper figure ) and @xmath101 , @xmath102 ( lower figure ) .",
    "let us briefly summarize what we have done : we have defined a discretization of the frenet ",
    "serret equations describing a curve in three - dimensional space . assuming that the curvature and torsion are both constant , and proportional to the discretization parameter @xmath19 this equation we have",
    "defines a discretized helical motion .",
    "we add uncorrelated gaussian noise of the order of @xmath103 to the curvature and torsion to define a helical brownian motion .",
    "next derive the fokker ",
    "planck equation for this stochastic process .",
    "the resulting process is , in fact , a random walk in which the probability of every step depends on the step s relative position with respect to the preceding _ two _ steps .",
    "indeed , the curvature dictates the average angle to the preceding step , whereas the torsion determines the average angle with respect to the plane generated by the two earlier steps .",
    "the process is fully determined by five parameters : the average curvature @xmath14 , the average torsion @xmath15 , the noise intensity for the curvature @xmath75 , the noise intensity for the torsion @xmath104 and finally the speed @xmath8 at which the particle moves . while this last parameter only fixes an otherwise arbitrary time scale and",
    "can thus in principle be disregarded , the other parameters are all essential .",
    "we then proceeded to determine the fourier ",
    "laplace transform of the various correlation functions of the orthogonal triad @xmath47 , @xmath105 and @xmath48 . from this",
    "it is possible to determine the effective diffusion constant .",
    "an explicit formula for it is derived in terms of the model s five parameters , see ( [ eq : diff ] ) .",
    "interestingly , there is a scaling parameter @xmath67 defined in terms of these five , see ( [ eq : scaled ] ) , such that an appropriately rescaled diffusion constant depends only on @xmath67 , see ( [ eq : diff1 ] ) .",
    "other quantities which can be evaluated explicitly are the asymptotic average position ( as a vector ) of the walk , as well as the correlation function of the darboux vector , which corresponds to the axis of the helix which would be generated in the noiseless limit .",
    "we show in particular that the asymptotic average position of the walk indeed coincides with the darboux vector in the low - noise limit .",
    "various special cases can also be treated more or less explicitly . among these",
    "are the two - dimensional case ( @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) , for which we have given an explicit expression for the correlations .",
    "a still open question concerns the response of the process when an external field is applied ; the difficulties for advancing in this question arise from the fact that a spatially fixed field rotates in the frenet frame .",
    "a related problem would be to understand the effects in the transport properties due to periodic or strategic variations in the parameters , attempting to steer the particle in a given direction @xcite .",
