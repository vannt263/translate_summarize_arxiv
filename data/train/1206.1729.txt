    "m dwarf stars , with masses @xmath21 m@xmath22 , make up the vast majority of the reservoir of nearby stars within @xmath23 pc .",
    "these stars have not traditionally been included in large numbers in the target lists of radial - velocity ( rv ) searches for planets for two main reasons : 1 ) their intrinsic faintness , which prevented doppler surveys in the optical from achieving very high radial - velocity precision ( @xmath24 m / s ) for large samples of m dwarfs ( e.g. , eggenberger & udry 2010 , and references therein ) , and 2 ) their being considered as providers of very inhospitable environments for potentially habitable planets ( e.g. , tarter et al . 2007 ; scalo et al .",
    "2007 , and references therein ) .",
    "these two paradigms are now shifting .",
    "first , the application of the transit technique to m dwarfs presents several exciting opportunities , and the advantages are especially compelling for the detection of transiting habitable , rocky planets .",
    "these include , for example , improved observing windows due to the short periods of potential planets in the stellar habitable zone ( the range of distances from a given star for which water could be found in liquid form on a planetary surface .",
    "e.g. , kasting et al .",
    "1993 ) , or the possibility to reach detection of rocky planets due to the small radii of m dwarfs , leading to deep transits ( @xmath25 mag ) easily detectable from the ground with modest - size telescopes ( @xmath26 cm class ) , and readily confirmable with present - day precision rv measurements ( owing to their moderately large rv amplitudes , on the order of 5 - 10 m / s ) .",
    "second , while not all concerns about their habitability have been resolved yet , there has been a recent change in view for planets orbiting low - mass m stars , now often considered as potentially hospitable worlds for life and its remote detection ( e.g. , seager & deming 2010 ; barnes et al .",
    "2011 , and references therein ) .",
    "advancements in our knowledge of the complex processes of planet formation and evolution can not be achieved without a detailed understanding of the role of the central star ( through its properties such as mass and metal abundance ) and its environment ( the circumstellar disk within which the planetary population must form ) .",
    "for example , the theoretical expectations ( within the framework of the standard core accretion model ) that giant planet frequency and upper mass limits ought to be direct functions of stellar mass @xmath27 and metallicity [ fe / h ] ( e.g. , laughlin et al . 2004 ; ida & lin 2004 , 2005 ; kennedy & kenyon 2008 ; mordasini et al .",
    "2009 ) have so far been confirmed on relatively firm statistical grounds only for stars ( mid - f through mid - k type ) with masses close to that of the sun ( santos et al . 2004 ; fischer & valenti 2005 ; johnson et al . 2007 ; sozzetti et al . 2009 ) , while results for stars with masses wignificantly different from that of the sun still rely on small - number statistics ( e.g. , endl et al .",
    "2006 ; bonfils et al . 2007 ; johnson et al . 2010 , 2011 , 2012 ) .",
    "similarly , the statistical significance of the early evidence for a relatively high frequency of low - mass planets ( neptunes and super - earths ) around low - mass stars ( e.g. , forveille et al .",
    "2011 , and references therein ) is still hampered by the observational bias intrinsic to long - term rv surveys ( only a few hundred objects monitored ) , and the recent , compelling evidence from kepler photometry ( e.g. , howard et al .",
    "2011 ) of increasing occurrence rates for small - radius , short - period planets around increasingly cooler stars still suffers from small - numbers statistics at the latest spectral types ( only a few hundred of relatively bright m0-m1 dwarfs being included in the kepler catalogue ) .",
    "finally , the anticipated wild diversity of the structural and atmospheric properties of super - earths ( seager & deming 2010 , and references therein ) can be most easily investigated using a sample of such planets observed as transiting companions to nearby m dwarf primaries , given that for low - mass stars the planet - to - star flux ratio is much larger than that for the earth - sun system , super - earth , this ratio is in the range 0.01%-011% for a mid- to late - m dwarf primary ( m4v - m8v ) , compared to 0.00044% for the earth - sun system . ] thus spectral characterization of the planet via , e.g. , occultation spectroscopy is much more readily attainable .",
    "these considerations have brought about renewed efforts to monitor photometrically as well as spectroscopically large samples of nearby cool dwarfs .",
    "the first spectacular success of the dedicated mearth transit search for rocky planets around 2000 late m dwarfs was announced by charbonneau et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , with the detection of the low - density transiting super - earth gj 1214b ( @xmath28 m@xmath4 , @xmath29 @xmath20 ) around a nearby m4.5 dwarf .",
    "the primary in this system is bright enough to enable the detailed spectroscopic characterization of the planet s thick atmosphere over a broad wavelength range ( bean et al .",
    "2010 , 2011 ; croll et al . 2011 ; crossfield et al .",
    "the recent constraints on gj 1214b s atmospheric composition are not only essential for breaking the degeneracy between the mass , radius and composition of both the interior and a possible atmosphere in theoretical models of super - earths ( adams et al .",
    "2008 ; rogers & seager 2010 ; miller - ricci & fortney 2010 ; miller - ricci et al .",
    "2011 ; dsert et al . 2011 ; nettelmann et al . 2011 ; menou 2011 ) , but they also constitute a remarkable test of planetary evolution models in a mass range ( for both the primary and the planet ! ) not seen in our solar system .",
    "very recently , the m2k doppler search for close - in planets around 1600 nearby m and k dwarfs has also started producing its first results ( e.g. , apps et al .",
    "decade - long doppler monitoring has also allowed to detect the first saturn - mass planet in the habitable zone of a nearby mid - m dwarf ( haghighipour et al .",
    "the early - m dwarf gj 581 , already hosting a system of four low - mass ( neptunes and super - earths ) planets , is currently the focus of a hot debate on the actual existence of a fifth planet with the mass of a super - earth orbiting right in the middle of the habitable zone ( vogt et al .",
    "2010 ; tuomi 2011 ; pepe et al . 2011 ; gregory 2011 ) .",
    "there is a growing consensus among the astronomers community that the first habitable rocky planet will be discovered ( and might have been discovered already ! ) around a red m dwarf in the backyard of our solar system .    however , not all physical properties of low - mass stars are known precisely enough for the purpose of the detection and characterization of small - radius planets .",
    "worse still , some of the characteristics intrinsic to late - type dwarfs can constitute a significant source of confusion in the interpretation in planet detection and characterization measurements across a range of techniques .",
    "first of all , there exist discrepancies between theory and observations in the determination of the sizes of m dwarfs , typically on the order of 10%-15% ( ribas 2006 ; beatty et al .",
    "2007 ; charbonneau et al .",
    "2009 , and references therein ) .",
    "it has been suggested that this problems might be stemming from the lack of a detailed treatment of the effects of non - zero magnetic fields on the properties of low - mass , fully convective stars ( ribas 2006 ; lpez - morales 2007 ; torres et al .",
    "2010 , and references therein ) . as a result ,",
    "the inferred composition of a transiting planet detected around an m dwarf might be subject to rather large uncertainties , particularly when it comes to super - earths , for which , as mentioned above , degeneracies in the models of their physical structure indicate a wide range of possible compositions for similar masses and radii ( seager & deming 2010 , and references therein ) .",
    "indeed , for the two known transiting planets around m dwarfs , gj 436b and gj 1214b , uncertainties in the planetary parameters are dominated by the limits in the knowledge of the stellar parameters .",
    "second , there are at present difficulties in spectroscopically determining with a high degree of precision m dwarf metallicities ( bean et al .",
    "2006 ; woolf & wallerstein 2006 ; woolf et al . 2009",
    "; rojas - ayala et al . 2010 ) , which are only partially mitigated by recent attempts at deriving photometric calibrations ( bonfils et al . 2005 ; casagrande et al .",
    "2008 ; johnson & apps 2009 ; schlaufman & laughlin 2010 ) .",
    "in addition , studies of the rotation - activity relation , usually coupled to measurements of the h@xmath30 luminosity ( e.g. , reiners & basri 2010 , and references therein ) , 2 ) spectroscopic monitoring of temporal evolution of the @xmath31 activity index as determined from the ca ii h & k emission line cores ( e.g. , wright et al .",
    "2004 ) , and 3 ) photometric determination of rotation periods for stars with significant spot coverage ( e.g. , strassmeier et al .",
    "2000 ) . ] for m dwarfs using large stellar samples are limited to young and active stellar samples ( e.g. , shkolnik et al .",
    "2009 ; lpez - santiago et al .",
    "2010 , and references therein ) , often in young open clusters ( e.g. , meibom et al . 2009 ; hartman et al . 2009 , and references therein ) , while our understanding of the rotation - activity connection for m dwarfs with age greater than @xmath32 gyr ( e.g. , pizzolato et al . 2003 ; reiners 2007 ; jenkins et al . 2009 ; west & basri 2009 ) is still subject to rather large uncertainties due to the sparseness of the data .",
    "all these issues hamper at present the possibility of determining precisely the ages of ( particularly mid- and late- ) m dwarfs in the field , and this in turn has a significant impact on the calibration of the fundamental evolutionary properties of the planets they might be hosting .",
    "third , as measurements of chromospheric activity indicators ( h@xmath30 line ) have shown how the fraction of active m dwarfs increases as a function of spectral sub - type ( e.g. , bochanski et al .",
    "2005 ; west et al . 2011 ) , activity - related phenomena such as stellar spots , plages , and flares become increasingly a matter of concern for planet detection and characterization programs targeting late - type stars .",
    "stellar surface inhomogeneities can hamper the detection , and sometimes even mimic the signal , of exoplanets ( e.g. , queloz et al .",
    "2001 ) , and seriously complicate the characterization of their properties .",
    "this problem has already become acute in the case of active solar analogs hosting transiting planets .",
    "an illustrative example is provided by the ongoing debate on the actual mass of corot-7b , varying ( including 1-@xmath33 uncertainties as large as 20% ) between 1 @xmath34 and 9 @xmath34 ( ! ) , depending on how one decides to deal with the modelling of the planetary signal superposed to the much larger activity - induced stellar ` jitter ' in both the photometric and the radial - velocity measurements ( queloz et al .",
    "2009 ; hatzes et al . 2010",
    "; pont et al .",
    "2011 ; ferraz - mello et al .",
    "recently , the first serious studies attempting to gauge the limits to planet detection induced by stellar activity - related phenomena , and strategies aiming at minimizing such effects , have been undertaken .",
    "these have focused primarily on the impact of , and possibility of calibrating out , activity - induced jitter in high - precision radial - velocity and astrometric measurements ( makarov et al .",
    "2009 ; lagrange et al .",
    "2010 ; boisse et al .",
    "2011 , and references therein ; dumusque et al .",
    "2011 ; sozzetti 2011 , and references therein ) .",
    "very recently , the first analyses of the impact of starspots on radial - velocity searches for earth - mass planets in orbit about m dwarf stars have been carried out by reiners et al . (",
    "2010 ) and barnes et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , who also addressed the merit of moving from the optical to infrared wavelengths ( where the starpots - induced rv noise might be significantly reduced ) .",
    "all the above considerations clearly underline how achieving the goal of the detection _ and _ characterization of low - mass , potentially habitable , rocky planets around low - mass stars requires the construction of a large ( all - sky ) sample of nearby , relatively bright m dwarfs with well - characterized properties .",
    "this will necessitate the combined use of time - series of spectroscopic , astrometric , and photometric data of high quality .",
    "in particular , the jitter levels will have to be quantified in detail for each target individually , as the jitter properties may vary from star to star within the same spectral class , as suggested by recent findings based on high - precision kepler photometry ( e.g. , ciardi et al . 2011 ) and high - resolution , high - s / n spectroscopy ( e.g. , zechmeister et al . 2009 ) .",
    "with kick - off in december 2009 , we have carried out a year - long pilot study for an upcoming photometric transiting search for small - size planets around thousands of nearby m dwarfs which will utilize an array of five 40-cm telescopes at the astronomical observatory of the autonomous region of the aosta valley ( oavda ) , in the western italian alps .",
    "the oavda site was selected on the basis of a detailed site characterization study ( damasso et al .",
    "the pilot study was focused on the medium - term ( typically for 2 months ) photometric monitoring , using small - size instrumentation ( 25 - 80 cm class telescope systems ) , of a sample of @xmath35 cool m0-m6 dwarfs with good parallaxes from the torino parallax program ( topp ; smart et al .",
    "the primary objectives we set out to achieve in this study were @xmath2 to demonstrate sensitivity to @xmath3 r@xmath4 ( i.e. , smaller than radius of neptune ) transiting planets with periods of a few days around our sample , through a two - fold approach that combines a characterization of the statistical noise properties of our photometry with the determination of transit detection probabilities via simulations , and @xmath5 where possible , to better our knowledge of some astrophysical properties ( e.g. , activity , rotation , age ) of our targets through a combination of spectroscopic and astrometric information and our differential photometric measurements .    in ",
    "2 we describe the oavda instrumentation utilized during the pilot study , and outline the dedicated pipeline for the data processing and analysis of the photometric data we have developed .",
    "we discuss in ",
    "3 the main characteristics of the m dwarf sample targeted by the pilot study , and present in ",
    "4 the main results of the study in terms of 1 ) achieved short - term and medium - term photometric sensitivity for our sample , 2 ) improved characterization of the properties of the cool m dwarfs observed , by combining the knowledge of their photometric micro - variability time - scales with other available spectroscopic , photometric , and astrometric observations , and 3 ) a careful assessment of the limits to transiting planetary companions for each star in our sample .",
    "we conclude in   5 by summarizing our findings and by discussing the preparatory steps for the upcoming long - term photometric monitoring program to characterize the micro - variability features of and search for transiting small - size planetary companions to a well - defined sample of low - mass stars , to be carried at the oavda site in the near future .",
    "the instrumental set up used in this study is very similar to the one adopted for the oavda site characterization study described in damasso et al .",
    "( 2010 ) . in summary",
    ", we used a small - size telescope array composed of three instruments with diameters of 81 cm , 40 cm , and 25 cm , respectively . for the purpose of the pilot study described here ,",
    "the 40-cm and the 25-cm telescopes performed all the observations equipped with standard johnson - cousins @xmath36 filters , while the 81-cm utilized a standard johnson - cousins @xmath37 filter ( observations in the @xmath36 filter with this instrument were affected by fringing ) .",
    "naturally , the choice of filters was driven by red colours of the target sample . in table",
    "[ table:1 ] we summarize the main characteristics of the telescope and camera systems .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we note that our choice to fit for the scalar @xmath38r@xmath39 rather than the individual values for the brightness contrast @xmath40 and the spot radius @xmath41 is due to the fact that in the makarov et al .",
    "( 2009 ) model these two parameters appear strongly correlated , and attempting to fit for them separately results in very loose constraints on their actual values , and poor overall convergence of the spot model .",
    "this effect can be easily understood , as in the disk - integrated stellar flux data the effect of a cold , small spot is difficult to distinguish from the signal produced by one which is warmer and larger .",
    "the price to pay in this case , in that we do nt directly estimate the spot size and temperature , is minimal , as this exercise , for the purpose of this study , must be intended solely as a consistency check of the interpretation of the rotational modulation for the two stars based on the photometric and spectroscopic data presented above .",
    "possible future developments include the implementation of more sophisticated ( single and multiple ) spot models , and the detailed assessment of their uncertainties through , e.g. , bayesian statistics .",
    "flaring events , a powerful indicator of the presence of strong stellar magnetic fields , are known to be relatively common among late - type stars , typically lasting between a few minutes up to several hours , and producing increases in the observed flux of up to several magnitudes . while ground - based as well as space - borne long time - series photometric studies of open clusters and in the field over a range of wavelengths ( moffett 1974 ; lacy et al .",
    "1976 ; audard et al .",
    "2000 ; gdel et al .",
    "2003 ) have begun unveiling some important correlations between flare occurrence rates and stellar characteristics such as mass , age , and activity levels ( e.g. , ambartsumyan et al .",
    "1970 ; mirzoyan et al .",
    "1989 ; kowalski et al .",
    "2009 ) , the physics of flares is still far from being fully understood .",
    "several open questions still need to be properly addressed , which include the details of the energy release , the mechanisms for producing the atmospheric emission , and the understanding of flares on a global scale  how do flare properties ( occurrence rates , emission strength , timescales , frequency ) correlate with stellar characteristics ( mass , age , activity levels ) ?",
    "upcoming ground - based photometric surveys such as pan - starrs ( kaiser 2004 ) , ptf ( law et al . 2009 ) , and lsst  @xcite will certainly provide the opportunity to gather flare data for large numbers ( @xmath42 ) of stars , sampling wide ranges of flare amplitudes and timescales .",
    "however , a potentially important niche for ` classical ' flare studies ( i.e. , those based on the continuous monitoring of single objects ) will come as a by - product of those photometric programs , such as mearth ( nutzman & charbonneau 2008 ) or the upcoming survey at oavda , targeting large numbers of relatively bright late k and m dwarfs in search of transiting planets .",
    "for example , the detailed characterization of the flaring behavior for k and m dwarfs objectives of targeted searches for transiting planets is an important ingredient towards the thorough understanding of the impact a star and its environment might have through time on the habitability of any planet it may harbor which could sustain the presence of liquid water on its surface ( e.g. , kasting et al .",
    "1993 ; lammer et al . 2007 ; guinan et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "two of the stars included in our pilot study , lhs 3445 and lhs 2686 , showed flaring events in the photometry gathered over a period of 66 days and 60 days , respectively .",
    "lhs 3445 is classified as uv cet type flare star ( gershberg et al .",
    "1999 ) , while no information on flaring is available in the literature for lhs 2686 .",
    "given the sampling rate of the two light - curves ( 54 sec and 75 sec , respectively ) , we were sensitive to flares with decay times larger than @xmath43 min .",
    "visual inspection of the light - curves allowed us to infer decay times of a few minutes ( ` impulsive ' flares . see , e.g. , krautter 1996 ) .",
    "as an illustrative exercise of the type of studies that will be possible once observations will be gathered in survey mode , we characterized the events following the approach of hartman et al .",
    "2011 , i.e. by solving a non - linear least squares problem with a set of consecutive photometric measurements starting from the time of recorded maximum brightness @xmath44 and an exponential model function of the type :    @xmath45    with adjustable parameters @xmath46 , the peak magnitude of the flare relative to the non - flaring magnitude , @xmath47 , the decay timescale , and @xmath48 , the differential normalized magnitude ( see   [ sec : metod ] for its definition ) of the star before the flare .",
    "the least squares solution was obtained with an idl implementation of the levenberg - marquardt method ( levenberg 1944 ; marquardt 1963 ) , mpfit by craig markwardt ( markwardt 2009 ) , and starting guesses for the model parameters @xmath46 equal to the peak magnitude , @xmath49 d , amd @xmath48 equal to the average differential magnitude of each time series .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ figflares ] .",
    "for lhs 3445 , two of the three recorded flares occurred within a timespan of 1.2 hrs during the same night , possibly a case of homologous flares ( e.g. , martres et al .",
    "1984 ; doyle et al . 1990 ; ranns et al .",
    "2000 ) .     to the light curve . for lhs 3445 ,",
    "two almost consecutives flares were recorded , with approximately equal decay times of @xmath50 min.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]      while no transit event has been recorded in our dataset , as reported in   [ sec : bls ] , the photometric measurements obtained for our sample can be utilized to carry out simulations aimed at determining what sensitivity to transiting companions ( of given radius and period ) we achieved on a star - by - star basis , expressed in terms of easy - to - interpret comparison metrics , such as detection probabilities and phase coverage . these simulation tools .",
    "whose application to the data collected during the pilot study we illustrate here , will be of great use in the careful prioritization and for the optimization of the scheduling of the targets during survey operations .    in order to evaluate the sensitivity of each of the m dwarfs in our sample to transiting companions of given period and given radius , provided the primary size from table  [ table:3 ] ( or equivalently inducing a transit signal of given depth )",
    ", a large - scale simulation was performed by injecting synthetic transit signals into the differential light curves ( both intra - night and full - period ) of our targets ( without @xmath33-clipping as in   [ sec : bls ] ) .",
    "we utilized these data under the hypothesis that the procedure adopted to extract it from the raw images does not affect the signal .",
    "this simplificatory assumption is often adopted when dealing with such issues ( e.g. , irwin et al . 2011 ) .",
    "furthermore , transit signal injection was performed on all light curves obtained with the four methods for differential photometry described in   2 .",
    "we are aware that the specific choices for these elements of the simulation setup can in principle impact our findings to some extent .",
    "for example , we are not in a position to estimate quantitatively the effects on our capability to recover transit signals due to the application of trend - filtering algorithms during the production of the differential photometric data in pipeline mode .",
    "however , the goal of the present analysis is simply to gauge our ability to detect transit events as a function of the system parameters , given an observed distribution of rms values for our stellar sample .",
    "the present simulation setup is thus appropriate for this purpose , and any in - depth evaluation of , e.g. , the quality of the calibration procedures against transit signal detection thresholds goes beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we plan to relax the above assumptions and caveats in a future work in which we will carry out new studies based on a fully consistent end - to - end analysis ( including extraction and differential photometry ) of modified images in which synthetic transit signals will have been injected already at the pixel level .    the input parameters ( and their ranges ) to the simulation , which was entirely carried out in idl , we determined based on considerations taking into account the temporal sampling , total timespan , and typical photometric precision of our data .",
    "we generated :    * 1000 random , uniformly distributed periods in the range @xmath51 days ; * 100 random , uniformly distributed phases for each period ; * 4 amplitudes of the transit signal depth @xmath52 ( in flux units : 0.02 , 0.015 , 0.01 , 0.005 ) for each period and phase .",

    "we recognize that allowing the inclination to float might change to some extent the details of the detection probability results . a detailed study of the sensitivity to non - central ( eventually in the limit of quasi - grazing ) transits is left for the future .    with the above simulation setup ,",

    ", the synthetic transit signals were then injected on both nightly and full - period light curves .",
    "the choice of running the simulation for the whole suite of differential photometry methods was driven by the findings of   [ phot_prec ] and   [ rdn ] , thus allowing us to gauge the sensitivity of the transit detection probability to variable photometric precision .",

    "the top - most four sub - panels ( @xmath64 ) show , for each of the values of @xmath52 simulated , the original distribution of injected transit signals ( solid line ) and that of those signals whose corresponding light curves ( synthetic as well as combined ) are subsequently fed to bls ( dashed line ) , both expressed as a function of period .",
    "the second set of sub - panels ( @xmath65 ) shows the fraction of bls - detected signals in the synthetic datasets ( solid line ) and in the combined light curves ( dashed line ) .",
    "the third set of sub - panels ( @xmath66 ) shows the distribution of the signal detection efficiency ( @xmath67 ) parameter both in the case of synthetic light curves ( solid line ) and for the combined light curves ( dashed line ) .",
    "we remind the reader that a value for @xmath67 , which quantifies the statistical robustness of a detected transit - like periodic signal in the language of bls , is computed as :    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the value of the peak in the signal residue distribution , while @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the mean and the standard deviation of _ sr _ over the frequency band tested ( see kovcs et al .",
    "2002 for details ) .",
    "finally , the last set of sub - panels ( @xmath72 ) shows the distribution of the transit depths of the detected signals as evaluated by bls from the synthetic light curves ( solid line ) and from the combined light curves ( dashed line ) .",
    "for all three figures , sub - panels _ a _ and _ b _ clearly illustrate the dependence of transit detection probability on period .",
    "as expected , this behaviour is very similar to the trend of phase coverage with period ( see figure  [ figph ] ) .",
    "panels @xmath65 also quantify the amount of degradation in detection probability , with respect to the noise - free case , when the transit depth approaches the typical photometric precision , even when the phase coverage is very good .",
    "the three sets of sub - panels _ c _ illustrate how the statistical significance of a detection , as measured by the @xmath67 values , changes with phase coverage and signal depth .",
    "the values of @xmath67 can also be used to quantify the probability of a detection being a false positive .",
    "the actual behaviour of @xmath67 depends on many factors , some intrinsic to the algorithm ( e.g. number of bins , number of trial periods ) and others depending on the quality of the data and of the signal ( e.g. @xmath73 ) , however the statistical studies kovcs et al .",
    "( 2002 ) indicate a value of @xmath74 above which the false positive probability is low ( @xmath75% ) . above such value",
    "the @xmath67 does not depend on the input parameters of bls ( figure  5 of kovcs et al .",
    "the plots in figure  [ figan1 ] show how the typical value of @xmath67 decreases with the amplitude of the signal and with the phase coverage . in figures",
    "[ figan2 ] and  [ figan3 ] this trend is less evident .",
    "this is due to the @xmath67 values fluctuating within a regime where the false positive probability is very high .",
    "the fact that many signals are detected with a low @xmath67 highlights the robustness of the bls algorithm , which is capable of uncovering weak and noisy signals albeit with low statistical confidence .    the analysis of the transit depth distribution , as shown in panel _",
    ", is a further test of the bls reliability .",
    "generally bls provides a good estimate of the signal amplitude , but looking at the three figures an underestimation of the signal amplitude can be noticed .",
    "this is due to the initial parameters ( number of bins , number of trial periods ) of bls that , in this case ( in order to reduce the cpu time calculation ) , are insufficient to define precisely the ` border ' of the signal .",
    "this effect appears to increase with the phase coverage .",
    "this should be explained taking in account that the number of `` spurious '' points increases with such phase coverage . to verify that this underestimate depends on the input parameters of bls , we ran the algorithm on our archive data for the transiting planet wasp-3b ( damasso et al .",
    "2010 ) increasing the number of trial periods to 10000 ( in the same range of the simulation ) and the number of bins to 300 , and we recovered a transit depth in good agreement with the published one ( nearly 2% ) .",
    "the previous considerations allow us to relate directly the two comparison metrics whose properties we have analysed here , i.e. transit detection probability and phase coverage .",
    "we show in figure  [ figfas ] , for the full stellar sample under investigation and using the simulation results based on light curves obtained with method @xmath63 , the detection probability as a function of the phase coverage , both averaged over the whole period range @xmath76 days .",
    "different symbols are used to show the trend of detection probability for the four regimes of transit depth simulated . for the definitions of transit detection probability and phase coverage provided above",
    ", the plot suggests a limit to the probability of detecting a transit , at least utilizing a real - life detection algorithm such as bls , even when the phase coverage is almost 100% , a limit which becomes severe when the magnitude of the signal approaches the typical precision of the photometry .",
    "we believe that this effect is due to several factors , which include ( but are not limited to ) : a ) the way we actually define a detection : as discussed above , we adopt here a conservative definition , likely contributing to missing some of the correctly identified transit depths simply because the period did not fall within the stringent agreement constraints required ; b ) the fact that detection probabilities are averaged over period ranges which include values ( close to integer and half - integer days ) not optimally sampled in a ground - based , single - site campaign ( see figure  [ figph ] ) ; and c ) the way we actually define the phase coverage : the choice of bin size and the prescription for the number of points in a bin required to define a specific phase covered can also impact the likelihood that the transit will be detected at that specific phase .",
    "% : diamonds ; @xmath77% : triangles ; @xmath78% : squares ; @xmath79% : crosses).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    similarly , figure  [ figfas1 ] shows the trend of detection probability as a function of phase coverage when limiting ourselves to the period range 0.5 - 1.0 days .",
    "overall , for objects with good ( @xmath15 ) phase coverage , we would have had @xmath16 chances of detecting transiting companions with transit depths in the range @xmath80 .",
    "given the estimated stellar radii for these stars , this translates in a sensitivity to companions with minimum radii in the range @xmath19 @xmath20 .",
    "figure  [ figfas1 ] also shows how , when enough transits ( @xmath81 ) are observed , even signals of magnitude comparable to the photometric precision can be reliably retrieved in our data .",
    "all symbols are as described in figure  [ figfas].,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    as mentioned earlier , the results shown here cover the analysis of the simulation based on light curves derived with the @xmath63 photometric analysis method .",
    "the results based on the other three intra - night methods ( not shown here ) are very similar while they worsen significantly when the full - period light curves are considered .",
    "this is an expected result because those methods produce more noisy light curves ( see   [ sec : photprec ] ) .",
    "however , such an effect is cause of no significant worries , as operationally transit - like events , whose duration for objects in short periods does not exceed the typical length of observations during one single night , are to be searched for in nightly - reduced differential photometric datasets .    to conclude , two points are worth mentioning further here .",
    "first , in a large - scale survey of thousands of m dwarfs , while some degree of prioritization of the targets based on their measured and/or inferred variability properties ( based , e.g. , on activity indicators and rotation information ) will be possible , for many stars disregarding variability will simply not be an option .",
    "as for the two stars for which we successfully determined rotation periods , the probability of detection of a transit is not affected by the presence of the rotational modulation effect , as in both cases the time - scales of central transit events probed in our simulations ( between 0.8 hr and 1.8 hr for lhs 3445 and between 0.4 hr and 0.9 hr for gj 1167a ) are significantly shorter than the observed rotational periods .",
    "certainly , for much longer transit durations , or much shorter rotational periods , variability can instead become a matter of concern as it would directly interfere with a transit search .",
    "rotational modulation on time - scales of 0.1 days is indeed observed ( e.g. , irwin et al .",
    "2011 ) , and such issue will be addressed and dealt with in detail in the future .",
    "second , variable degrees of correlated noise , either instrumental ( tracking , flat - fielding ) , environmental ( airmass , absorption , seeing ) or astrophysical ( colour , variability ) in nature , can also affect our capability to detect transits .",
    "as shown by pont et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , red noise primarily impacts the significance thresholds with which a transit event can be recovered from the data in a survey . as discussed in   [ rdn ] , it constitutes a challenge to be able to fully characterize the relative role played by correlated noise sources on the potential of a photometric survey to detect statistically significant transit events , as this analysis will also depend on the details of the observed target populations . in the future",
    ", such an assessment will be made using our survey data and a statistically significant sample of targets .",
    "we report results of a one - year long photometric monitoring campaign of a sample of 23 nearby ( @xmath82 pc ) , bright ( @xmath83 ) m dwarfs carried out in italy at the astronomical observatory of the autonomous region of the aosta valley ( oavda ) , using small - size ( @xmath84-m class ) telescopes .",
    "this survey was conceived as a necessary preparatory step towards a long - term search for transiting , small - radius planets around thousands of dm stars , which will be conducted at oavda with an array of automated 40-cm telescopes , beginning early 2012 .",
    "this ` pilot study ' was designed to achieve two goals : @xmath85 demonstrate the sensitivity to @xmath3 @xmath20 transiting planets with periods of a few days around our program stars , through a two - fold approach that combines a characterization of the statistical noise properties of our photometry with the determination of transit detection probabilities via simulations , and b ) where possible , improve our knowledge of some astrophysical properties ( e.g. , activity , rotation ) of our targets through a combination of spectroscopic information and our differential photometric measurements . at a technical level ,",
    "the results we obtained during the pilot study are instrumental to the accurate design and fine tuning of several aspects of our upcoming photometric survey , such as the definition of the best observational strategy , the optmization of the target list , and the identification of improvements to be carried out on the pipeline for the photometric data reduction and time - series periodicity analysis .",
    "our main findings can be summarized as follows :    @xmath86 @xmath87 .",
    "we achieve a typical nightly rms photometric precision of @xmath6 mmag , with little or no dependence on the instrumentation adopted or on the details of the methodology ( different comparison stars selection criteria , use of different detrending algorithms ) utilized to perform differential photometry on the targets .",
    "we also carried out an analysis of the impact of correlated ( red ) noise on time - scales of @xmath88 30 min , which showed that it is typically a factor @xmath88 1.3 greater than pure white noise , with a weak dependence on the method used to perform differential photometry .",
    "this result reveals that our data are only mildly affected by short - term correlated systematics .",
    "the estimated photometric precision degrades to @xmath89 mmag when the ensemble light curves are determined over the typical @xmath90 months duration of the observations for each target .",
    "such degradation is understood in terms of a combination of unmodeled medium - term systematics in our data and intrinsic variability of our target stars .",
    "@xmath86 @xmath91 .",
    "we searched for periodic transit - like events in the photometric dataset for each target using the bls algorithm .",
    "no such signal was recovered for any target .",
    "this is an expected result given the sample size , thus meaningful constraints / upper limits on the planet fraction as a function of radius and orbital separation can not be provided .",
    "the light curves of our program stars were inspected for evidence of periodic signals of approximately sinusoidal shape , which could be interpreted as due to the presence of rotating spots on the stellar photosphere . for two stars in our sample ,",
    "lhs 3445 and gj 1167a , we found clear evidence of a periodicity in the light curve ascribable to such effect .",
    "we determined photometric rotation periods of @xmath92 days and @xmath93 days for lhs 3445 and gj 1167a , respectively ; these estimates were confirmed by the large projected rotational velocities ( @xmath94 km / s and @xmath95 km / s , respectively ) inferred for both stars based on the analysis of archival high - resolution keck / hires spectra .",
    "the estimated inclinations of the stellar rotation axes for lhs 3445 and gj 1167a agree with those derived using a simple spot model , which successfully reproduces the observed sinusoidal photometric variations in both cases ( the dispersion of the post - fit residuals is on the order of the sample photometric precision ) . finally , we detected short - term , low - amplitude flaring events in the differential photometric measurements of lhs 3445 and lhs 2686 ( the latter not known to be a flare star ) .",
    "lhs 3445 was observed flaring three times , and two flares were recorded almost consecutively during the same night , with an approximately equal decay time of @xmath88 4.5 min , possibly a case of homologous flares .",
    "@xmath86 @xmath96 .",
    "we carried out large - scale simulations of transit signals ( of periods in the range @xmath51 days and depths in the range 0.5%-2% in flux units ) injected in the actual ( nightly reduced ) photometric data for our sample .",
    "a total of 400,000 light curves were analysed for each target using a real - life transit events search algorithm ( bls ) .",
    "the study of the bls transit recovery rates and overall performance for a sub - sample of stars with good , fair , and poor phase coverage highlighted the capability of bls to identify the correct period ( when multiple transits were observed ) even for signals with depth close to the typical photometric precision of the data ( @xmath6 mmag ) , albeit with low statistical confidence , as well as some of its performance limitations which are driven by the specific choice of its most relevant setup parameters .",
    "we expressed our main findings in terms of two easy - to - use comparison metrics , i.e. transit detection probabilities and phase coverage .",
    "we found a quasi - linear relationship between the two quantities .",
    "based on the bls algorithm , there appears to be a limit of @xmath14 in the probability of detecting a transit even when the phase coverage approaches @xmath97 . around stars in our sample with good phase coverage ( @xmath98 )",
    ", we would have had @xmath99 chances of detecting companions with @xmath100 day and transit depths @xmath18 in flux units .",
    "correspondingly , around these stars we would have been sensitive to companions with radii as small as @xmath19 @xmath20 .",
    "the main findings reported here provide useful information for the purpose of the design and implementation of the operations of a ground - based m dwarf transit survey , with the aim of maximizing the chances for small - radius planet detection and improving our understanding of several astrophysically interesting properties of m dwarfs , particularly when investigated by means of statistical analyses of large stellar samples .",
    "together with other similar efforts carried out by other groups , such as the pioneering mearth program , the photometric database populated by our survey data will be of great help , for example , a ) to improve the characterization of nearby m dwarf stars , when combined with gaia s exquisitely accurate astrometry ( e.g. , sozzetti 2011 ) , and b ) to optimize the target selection criteria for red dwarfs which might be included in next - generation space - based transit survey programs , such as tess ( ricker et al .",
    "2010 ) and plato ( rauer & catala 2011 ) or which might be selected for spectroscopic characterization of planetary atmospheres of transiting planets found orbiting cool , nearby stars with future space - borne infrared observatories such as echo ( tinetti et al . 2011 ) and finesse ( swain 2010 ) .",
    "a forthcoming paper will present in detail all relevant aspects of the upcoming survey , including overall systems description , operations control software , target selection criteria , robust reduction pipeline and archiving .",

    "<S> we present the results of a year - long photometric monitoring campaign of a sample of 23 nearby ( @xmath0 pc ) , bright ( @xmath1 ) dm stars carried out at the astronomical observatory of the autonomous region of the aosta valley , in the western italian alps . </S>",
    "<S> this program represents the ` pilot study ' for a long - term photometric transit search for planets around a large sample of nearby m dwarfs , due to start with an array of identical 40-cm class telescopes by the spring of 2012 . in this study </S>",
    "<S> , we set out to @xmath2 demonstrate the sensitivity to @xmath3 r@xmath4 transiting planets with periods of a few days around our program stars , through a two - fold approach that combines a characterization of the statistical noise properties of our photometry with the determination of transit detection probabilities via simulations , and @xmath5 where possible , improve our knowledge of some astrophysical properties ( e.g. , activity , rotation ) of our targets by combining spectroscopic information and our differential photometric measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we achieve a typical nightly rms photometric precision of @xmath6 mmag , with little or no dependence on the instrumentation used or on the details of the adopted methods for differential photometry . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of correlated ( red ) noise in our data degrades the precision by a factor @xmath7 with respect to a pure white noise regime . based on a detailed stellar variability analysis , @xmath2 we detected no transit - like events ( an expected result given the sample size ) ; @xmath5 we determined photometric rotation periods of @xmath80.47 days and @xmath80.22 days for lhs 3445 and gj 1167a , respectively ; @xmath9 these values agree with the large projected rotational velocities ( @xmath10 km / s and @xmath11 km / s , respectively ) inferred for both stars based on the analysis of archival spectra ; @xmath12 the estimated inclinations of the stellar rotation axes for lhs 3445 and gj 1167a are consistent with those derived using a simple spot model ; @xmath13 short - term , low - amplitude flaring events were recorded for lhs 3445 and lhs 2686 . finally , based on simulations of transit signals </S>",
    "<S> of given period and amplitude injected in the actual ( nightly reduced ) photometric data for our sample , we derive a relationship between transit detection probability and phase coverage . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , using the bls search algorithm , even when phase coverage approaches 100% , there is a limit to the detection probability of @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> around program stars with phase coverage @xmath15 we would have had @xmath16 chances of detecting planets with @xmath17 day inducing fractional transit depths @xmath18 , corresponding to minimum detectable radii in the range @xmath19 @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> these findings are illustrative of our high readiness level ahead of the main survey start .    </S>",
