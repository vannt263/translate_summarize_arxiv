    "the ongoing quest for generalizing the triangular power equality @xmath0 dates back to the work of steinmetz @xcite . in @xmath1",
    ", he observed that the apparent power @xmath2 in electric arcs with non - sinusoidal alternating current waveforms can be higher than the active power @xmath3 , even when the reactive power @xmath4 appears to be zero . to this day",
    ", there is still no consensus about how this difference should be explained under all given load situations .",
    "this has resulted in a variety of mutually inconsistent power models .",
    "traditionally , the problem is either approached in the time domain or in the frequency domain , or sometimes in a combination of both ; see for instance @xcite for an overview of the most prominent power models .",
    "apart from the discussion of whether the analysis should be performed in the time or the frequency domains , a new definition of reactive power is usually introduced as follows @xcite .",
    "first , if the waveforms are periodic , the active power is defined as the periodic mean of the instantaneous power , i.e. , @xmath5 and the apparent power as @xmath6 , with @xmath7 the rms norm .",
    "then , after introducing a new definition of the reactive power , say @xmath8 , it is assumed that the geometric sum of all power components is equal to the apparent power .",
    "when the geometric sum is smaller than the apparent power , a new quantity , say rest , is introduced to fulfil @xmath9 only in fryze s ( time - domain ) power model is the ` rest ' quantity absent . in most other theories ` rest '",
    "is either considered as an essential measure of a certain load parameter or is decomposed further into the geometric sum of new power components , @xmath10 .",
    "power models along the line of ( [ eq : s + rest ] ) have led to useful models for compensator design , and to a certain extent they have improved our understanding of what is going on . perhaps the most detailed example is the _",
    "currents physical components _ ( cpc ) model by czarnecki @xcite ( with over @xmath11 `",
    "rest ' components ) or the @xmath12 component decomposition of @xcite .",
    "our main objection , however , is that such models have no solid physical foundation in terms of conserved quantities , i.e. , no energy and power balance equations .",
    "additionally , some of the power components of the aforementioned decompositions are not unique in the sense that they depend on the chosen reference . for example , using the voltage as a reference generally leads to a different value of reactive power than using the current as a reference @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , the first author of the present paper went back to the classical sinusoidal phasor - based complex power model and generalized the phasor concept to periodic non - sinusoidal waveforms using the hilbert transform .",
    "this approach provides a consistent generalization of the classical power trinity to its time - varying counterpart @xmath13 , referred to as the real power , the imaginary power , and the time - varying apparent power , respectively .",
    "the real power @xmath14 can be associated to a power balance which states that the rate of change of a potential function that is related to the total stored magnetic and electric energies in time equals the power at the network port minus the dissipated power .",
    "the time - average of this balance provides the active power as defined in ( [ eq : pactive ] ) . on the other hand , for linear and time - invariant ( lti ) systems @xmath15",
    "is _ related _ to the difference between the total stored magnetic and electric energy , and its mean value provides budeanu s reactive power @xcite , but it can not be associated with the rate of change of some potential function in time , to be interpreted as reactive energy . from a physical perspective , this is rather dissatisfying .      recently , in the context of general electromagnetic fields in free space",
    ", the second author of the present paper has derived a _ generalized complex poynting theorem _ ( gcpt ) in which the active and reactive energies play completely symmetrical roles @xcite",
    ". this is accomplished by replacing all waveforms by their _ analytic signals _",
    "( positive - frequency parts ) and then complexifying the time , @xmath16 , with @xmath17 and @xmath18 , so that @xmath19 gives absolute convergence of all inverse fourier integrals to analytic functions of @xmath20 .",
    "it was then shown that ( a ) @xmath21 is a _ time - resolution scale _ and ( b ) all analytic signals are moving averages of the original signals over a ` fuzzy ' moving time interval @xmath22 .",
    "the real part of the gcpt then gives the power balance for the rate of change of the _ active energy _ in @xmath23 , while its imaginary part gives the power balance for the rate of change of _ reactive energy _ in @xmath21 ( not @xmath23 ) .",
    "all energies and powers are moving averages , as explained above .",
    "for this reason , @xmath23 is now reinterpreted as the _ active time ( interval ) _ and @xmath21 as the _ reactive time _ , the latter to be measured in _ seconds reactive _ [ sr ] .",
    "the gcpt thus _ completes _ the time - harmonic complex poynting theorem by giving an _ equal but dual _ physical status to active and reactive energies and powers .",
    ", the gcpt reduces to the _ real _ poynting theorem , thus bridging the gap between the real and complex poynting theorems . ]",
    "furthermore , it provides a rational basis for the volt - ampre reactive [ var ] , the somewhat strange unit used to measure reactive power .",
    "namely , the reactive current in the balance law for the reactive power is the flow of charge with respect to @xmath21 , measured in coulombs per seconds reactive [ c / sr ] or ampres reactive [ ar ] , and the reactive power is the rate of change of the reactive energy with respect to @xmath21 , measured in joules per second reactive or @xmath21 . _ ] or volt - ampre reactive : @xmath24=[v\\times c / sr]= [ var].}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] without the notion of reactive time , the [ var ] seems _ ad hoc_.      the present paper is a circuit - theoretic counterpart of @xcite and a refinement of @xcite .",
    "the contribution here is two - fold : first , in sections [ sec : balances][sec : classical ] , the necessary background material is provided on balance equations and the classical sinusoidal power model .",
    "it is pointed out that the imaginary part of the classical sinusoidal complex power model does not allow for a power balance equation .",
    "section [ sec : reints ] extends the classical phasor representation to general ( not necessarily sinusoidal or even periodic ) waveforms using the _ analytic - signal transform_. this makes possible the symmetry between the real and imaginary parts of the complex power and finally provides a balance equation for each part .",
    "secondly , section [ sec : xinstant ] shows that there can not exist an ` instantaneous ' reactive energy and refines the ideas of @xcite concerning budeanu s reactive power .",
    "the results are illustrated using a linear and time - invariant ( lti ) rlc load subject to a sinusoidal voltage source that contains a flicker component . in section",
    "[ sec : s ] we offer some final remarks .",
    "consider a single - phase generator transmitting energy to a load .",
    "we know from tellegen s theorem that at each instant the rate of energy ( i.e. , the power ) entering the load through its port gets distributed among the elements of the load network , so that none is lost . for a single - phase load network consisting of branches @xmath25 ( edges ) , the instantaneous power at the port is @xmath26 this equation holds regardless of the nature of the elements or the excitation and is consistent with the principle of conservation of energy . if the branches consists of lti resistors , inductors , and capacitors , then ( [ eq : pb ] ) can be explicitly written as @xmath27 or , equivalently , as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the total instant magnetic and electric energy , with @xmath30 and @xmath31 the total instantaneous dissipated power .    integrating ( [ eq : pbe ] ) over some time - interval ,",
    "say @xmath32 $ ] , gives @xmath33 which states that the total stored energy equals the energy at the port minus the total dissipated energy .",
    "for that reason , we refer to ( [ eq : eb ] ) as an _ energy balance _ equation and to ( [ eq : pbe ] ) as a _ power balance _ equation .",
    "the instantaneous ( or _ local _ ) balance ( [ eq : pbe ] ) thus implies the ` global ' balance ( [ eq : eb ] ) .",
    "let the voltage at the load terminals be given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the rms voltage . under the assumption that @xmath37 does not depend on the transmitted current ( infinitely strong power system )",
    ", the associated current reads @xmath38 the instantaneous power can be shown to be @xmath39 + q\\sin(2\\omega t+2\\alpha),\\ ] ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the active and reactive powers defined by @xmath40 with @xmath41 the phase - shift between @xmath37 and @xmath42 .    since @xmath43 , equation ( [ eq : eb ] ) implies that @xmath44 which states that the _ active _ power is the time average of the power dissipated in a period .",
    "unfortunately , the energy balance equation ( [ eq : eb ] ) reveals little about the physical nature of the second term in ( [ eq : p_sinus ] ) .",
    "there is no obvious connection between ( [ eq : pbe ] ) and the reactive power @xmath4 similar to ( [ eq : pdaverage ] ) .      alternatively , a standard method in electrical engineering is to represent ( [ eq : u_sinus ] ) and ( [ eq : i_sinus ] ) by their time - harmonic _ phasors _",
    "@xcite @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "this enables one to define the _ complex power _",
    "@xmath48 with its magnitude equal to the apparent power , i.e. , @xmath49 .",
    "furthermore , for arbitrary lti rlc loads , the phasor counterpart of ( [ eq : pb ] ) is given by @xmath50 which , upon substitution of @xmath51 and @xmath52 , yields the well - know expression @xcite @xmath53 . } \\ ] ] comparing the latter with ( [ eq : scomplex ] ) reveals that @xmath54 with @xmath55 whereas , setting @xmath56 yields @xmath57,\\ ] ] where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the mean values of @xmath60 and @xmath61 as given in ( [ eq : wme ] ) .      since @xmath62",
    "as @xmath63 is constant , the real part of ( [ eq : s_rlc ] ) gives @xmath54 ( which also directly follows from ( [ eq : pdaverage ] ) ) . however , there is no such balance equation for the imaginary part of ( [ eq : s_rlc ] ) in terms of a ( rate of change of ) reactive energy in active ( real ) time .",
    "the obstacle here is that the imaginary part is not integrable with respect to the voltage and current phasors , and therefore does not allow for a potential function that can be associated to reactive energy .",
    "this fact was proved in @xcite in the context of electromagnetic fields .",
    "to resolve the asymmetry between the real and imaginary parts of the complex power , and at the same time providing a fully consistent generalization of the classical power model for _ arbitrary _ square - integrable waveforms , we proceed along the lines of @xcite .",
    "the underlying mathematical principle behind the transition from the sinusoidal time functions ( [ eq : u_sinus])([eq : i_sinus ] ) to their rotating phasor representation ( [ eq : ui_rotating ] ) is the _ analytic signal _ , widely used in telecommunication and signal processing @xcite . for an arbitrary real voltage - current pair @xmath64 ,",
    "the analytic signal representation is defined as the _ positive - frequency _ part of the inverse fourier transform : @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes the frequency spectrum and @xmath67 denotes the _ hilbert transform of @xmath68 , given by @xmath69 where the cauchy principal value of the integral is implied .",

    "this is the basis for interpreting @xmath21 as a _ time - resolution scale_. note that in the limit @xmath85 , we have @xmath86 ; see @xcite for more details . ]",
    "the integrand of ( [ eq : u_analytic_time ] ) gains a low - pass filter with transfer function @xmath87 , which suppresses frequencies @xmath88 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath68 is square - integrable ( ` finite - energy ' ) , then ( [ eq : u_analytic_time ] ) defines an _ analytic _ voltage - current pair @xmath89 in the upper - half complex time plane .",
    "a direct time - domain representation of ( [ eq : u_analytic_time ] ) is given by the _ analytic - phasor transform _",
    "@xmath90 roughly , @xmath89 depends on @xmath91 mainly in the interval @xmath92 . along with the property @xmath93",

    "note that ( [ eq : tellegencomplexrlc_ts_final ] ) naturally splits into an active and a reactive power balance law , i.e. , @xmath107 and @xmath108 respectively .    clearly , ( [ eq : pbactive_st ] ) constitutes a power balance equation in the active time @xmath23 for the rate of change of the average active energy at scale @xmath21 .",

    "it states that scaled reactive power equals the rate of change of scaled reactive energy with respect to _",

    "] this may seem rather unconventional , but we simply have no choice , as demonstrated in section [ sec : tvphasor ] .",
    "it is simply the price of having a symmetric description of active and reactive energy .      at this point",
    "it is instructive to examine how for sinusoidal waveforms ( [ eq : tellegencomplexrlc_ts_final ] ) relates to ( [ eq : s_rlc ] ) . since @xmath113 and @xmath114",
    ", we have @xmath115 which clearly are time - independent .",
    "consequently , all scaled quantities in ( [ eq : tellegencomplexrlc_ts_final ] ) are time - independent , i.e. , @xmath116 since @xmath117 and @xmath118 , this reduces to @xmath119e^{-2\\omega s } , } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath120 as defined in ( [ eq : pd_sinus ] ) and @xmath58 and @xmath59 as defined in ( [ eq : wm_we_sinus ] ) .",

    "the quantities @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 in ( [ eq : tellegencomplexrlc_ts_final ] ) are the scaled versions of the instantaneous quantities @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 in ( [ eq : pbe ] ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath111 is the scaled version of @xmath128 which it is tempting to call the ` instantaneous reactive energy ' .",
    "but here we encounter a fundamental difference between the active and reactive energies , as explained in the more general context of electromagnetic fields in @xcite .",
    "this difference already becomes apparent at @xmath129 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath85 , the transformation ( [ eq : u_analytic_time ] ) reduces to ( [ eq : u_analytic ] ) , which states that each analytic voltage - current pair @xmath130 is the sum of the _ local _ ( real ) part @xmath131 and the _ nonlocal _ ( imaginary ) part @xmath132 . in that same limit , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 , where @xmath136\\ ] ] coincides with the _ real power _ as proposed in @xcite .",
    "when these quantities are inserted into ( [ eq : pbactive_st ] ) , we find that each side of the balance splits into a local part ( involving no hilbert transforms ) and a nonlocal part ( with hilbert transforms in each term ) .",
    "consequently , the local and nonlocal parts _ each _ satisfy ( [ eq : pbactive_st ] ) , and the balance equation for the local part simply coincides with the original balance law ( [ eq : pbe ] ) for the instantaneous energy .",
    "thus , in the limit @xmath85 , _ active energy can be localized_.    on the other hand , evaluation of the reactive - energy balance law ( [ eq : pbreactive_st ] ) at @xmath129 gives @xmath137 with @xmath138 , and @xmath139\\ ] ] coincides with the _ imaginary power _ as proposed in @xcite .",
    "although the reactive energy @xmath111 can be split into the sum of local and nonlocal parts , these can not be separated ( as in the active case ) because they do not individually satisfy ( [ eq : dsw ] ) .",
    "moreover , for @xmath17 , the local and nonlocal parts get mixed together as the scale changes according to ( [ eq : pbreactive_st ] ) .",
    "this shows that _ reactive energy is inherently nonlocal _ , which suggests that theories of ` instantaneous ' reactive energy and power must be fundamentally incorrect .",
    "thus , although @xmath140 and their @xmath129 limits are generally time - dependent , their time variables represent ` fuzzy ' time , _ not _ sharp instants .",
    "this may explain why there has been so much controversy and confusion around the origin and generalization of reactive energy and power .      in the limit @xmath85",
    ", the scaled reactive power @xmath141 thus reduces to the imaginary power @xmath15 .",
    "now , since we know from @xcite that budeanu s reactive power @xmath142 corresponds to the mean value of ( [ eq : q(t ) ] ) , it is easily deduced that for arbitrary waveforms @xmath143 , with @xmath144_{s=0},\\ ] ] which states that budeanu s reactive power equals the _",
    "mean _ rate of change of the scaled reactive energy at @xmath129 .",
    "budeanu s reactive power has the merit to indicate weather the load is dominantly inductive ( @xmath145 ) or capacitive ( @xmath146 ) .",
    "it is indeed not suitable for compensation purposes as properly forcing @xmath147 only compensates the mean value of the reactive power .",
    "consequently , the load does not exhibit a dominantly inductive or capacitive behaviour anymore , but there still might be a fluctuating part of the reactive power present .",
    "however , in contrast to the assertions made in @xcite against budeanu s power model , accepting the time - scale domain ( [ eq : budeanu_st ] ) can be considered as proof that budeanu s reactive power _ does _ possess a physical interpretation .",
    "a resolution of budeanu s distortion power is proposed in @xcite .",
    "consider the rlc load network of fig .",
    "[ fig : rlc_flick ] supplied with a sinusoidal voltage that contains a @xmath148 flicker component .",
    "the resulting energies and powers all become time - varying as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rlc_flick ] for @xmath129 , except for the mean value of ( [ eq : p(t ) ] ) , which represents the active power ( [ eq : pactive ] ) , here obtained as @xmath149_{s=0 } { \\text{d}}t =   10.05 \\ \\text{w},\\ ] ] and budeanu s reactive power @xmath150 var .",
    "the analysis in this paper shows that there can not exist a balance equation for reactive energy in active ( real ) time . to obtain symmetry between the real and imaginary parts of the complex power ( [ eq : tellegencomplexrlc ] ) , allowing to set up power balance equations for both parts , we must complexify time as @xmath151 .",
    "this results in a power balance associated to the rate of active energy with respect to @xmath23 and a power balance associated to the rate of reactive energy with respect to @xmath21 .",
    "it becomes apparent from ( [ eq : tellegencomplexrlc_ts_final ] ) that there does not exists an overall scaled ` complex potential function ' that represents ` complex energy ' analogous to @xmath152 .",
    "there is no _ qualitative _ difference between active and reactive energy , as both quantities are measured in joules [ j ] .",
    "the difference is solely _ quantitative _ : @xmath153 contributes positively to @xmath154 and negatively to @xmath155 , whereas @xmath156 contributes positively to both . only for rates of change of energy",
    "does a qualitative difference emerge between active and reactive variables , as it becomes necessary to specify if the rate of change is with respect to @xmath23 or @xmath21 .",

    "preliminary studies show that this can be resolved by extending the reactive power balance ( [ eq : pbreactive_st ] ) to include the characteristics of nonlinear and/or time - varying resistors . in case",
    "the load contains nonlinear and/or time - varying inductors and capacitors , the magnetic and electric energies need to be extended accordingly .",
