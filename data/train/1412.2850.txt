    "generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) have been identified as a powerful tool to analyze the angular momentum decomposition of the nucleon@xcite .",
    "furthermore gpds can also be used to create truly three - dimensional images of the nucleon in the form of impact parameter dependent parton distributions@xcite .",
    "these images in a space where one dimension describes the light - cone momentum fraction and the other two dimensions describe the transverse position of the parton ( relative to the transverse center of momentum ) are complemented by transverse momentum dependent parton distributions ( tmds)@xcite .",
    "wigner distributions provide a framework that allows a simultaneous description of gpds and tmds@xcite .    orbital angular momentum ( oam )",
    "correlates the position and momentum of partons .",
    "one can thus utilize wigner distributions , which simultaneously embody the distribution of position and momentum , to define oam@xcite .",
    "however , in the definition of these distributions , care must be applied to ensure gauge invariance .",
    "this can be accomplished by connecting any nonlocal correlation function with a wilson - line gauge link , which requires specifying a path along which the vector potential is evaluated .",
    "the choice of path raises the immediate issue of how the quantities defined using wigner distributions ( tmds , oam , ... ) depend on that choice .",
    "the importance of this issue had become evident in the context of single - spin asymmetries ( ssas ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , while a straight - line gauge link definition of tmds yields a vanishing sivers effect @xcite , the correct gauge link relevant for tmds in semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering ( sidis ) involves a detour to light - cone infinity @xcite in order to properly include final - state interactions . in light - cone gauge , this subtlety had first been overlooked since in that gauge the sivers effect solely arises from the contribution from the gauge - link piece at light - cone infinity @xcite .    with wigner distributions and oam defined through them these issues arise all over again @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this note is to address that dependence of oam defined through wigner distributions on the choice of path for the gauge link and to interpret the resulting difference between common definitions of oam .",
    "in a target that is polarized transversely ( _ e.g. _ vertically ) , the quarks in the target can exhibit a ( left / right ) asymmetry of the distribution @xmath0 in their transverse momentum @xmath1",
    "@xcite f_q / p^(,*k*_t ) = f_1^q(,k_t^2 ) -f_1t^q(,k_t^2 ) , [ eq : sivers ] where @xmath2 is the spin of the target nucleon and @xmath3 is a unit vector opposite to the direction of the virtual photon momentum .",
    "the fact that such a term may be present in ( [ eq : sivers ] ) is known as the sivers effect and the function @xmath4 is known as the sivers function .",
    "the latter vanishes in a naive parton picture since @xmath5 is odd under naive time reversal ( a property known as naive - t - odd ) , where one merely reverses the direction of all momenta and spins without interchanging the initial and final states .",
    "the significant distortion of parton distributions in impact parameter space @xcite provides a natural mechanism for a sivers effect . in semi - inclusive dis , when the virtual photon strikes a @xmath6 quark in a @xmath7 polarized proton , the @xmath6 quark distribution is enhanced on the left side of the target ( for a proton with spin pointing up when viewed from the virtual photon perspective ) .",
    "1.cm    ( 10,2.3)(3.,19.2 )    although in general the final state interaction ( fsi ) is very complicated , we expect it to be on average attractive thus translating a position space distortion to the left into a momentum space asymmetry to the right and vice versa ( fig .",
    "[ fig : deflect])@xcite . with this simple mechanism",
    "one finds that @xmath8 , while @xmath9 .",
    "both signs have been confirmed by a flavor analysis based on pions produced in a sidis experiment by the hermes @xcite and compass @xcite collaborations and are consistent with a vanishing isoscalar sivers function observed by compass @xcite .",
    "recent inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments on a transversely polarized target in hall a at jefferson lab showed for the first time a ( small ) single - spin asymmetry ( ssa ) for the scattered electron .",
    "as such an asymmetry has to vanish in single photon exchange , these measurements potentially reveal important information about quark correlations in the nucleon .    in a dis process",
    ", the transverse position of the scattered electron should be very close to that of the struck quark .",
    "one may thus estimate the effect from the initial and final state interactions of the electron by correlating the leading twist quark density with the electromagnetic field strength tensor at the same transverse position .",
    "this observation motivates to consider @xcite -m_t^ijs_t^j f_ft^q e^ixp^+^- p , s||^q(0)^+ef_qed^+i(^-)^q(^-)|p , s , [ eq : fft ] where @xmath10 is the elementary electric charge .",
    "@xmath11 represents the quark momentum , which is diagonal in this soft photon pole matrix element . if the electromagnetic field strength tensor @xmath12 is replaced by its qcd counterpart @xmath13 then eq .",
    "( [ eq : fft ] ) represents the qiu - sterman matrix element @xcite for the single - spin asymmetry in semi - inclusive dis ( sidis ) .",
    "we will make use of this analogy several times .    although eq .",
    "( [ eq : fft ] ) represents the average transverse momentum acquired by the electron due to isi and fsi , it would yield the average transverse momentum of the active quark due to electromagnetic fsi if we were to multiply by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the factor @xmath17 accounts for the fact that the @xmath18 in inclusive dis experiences both isi and fsi , while the quark in sidis experiences only fsi .    as a corollary",
    ", one finds the sum rule @xcite f_ft^u - f_ft^d+ ... =0 [ eq : sumrule ] regardless whether the target is a proton or a neutron .",
    "thus similar to the case for qcd@xcite , the average transverse momentum due to the fsi also vanishes in the abelian case , provided one sums over all charged constituents . note that if one neglects strange or heavier quarks , then the sum rule implies that @xmath19 and @xmath20 must have the same sign so that they can sum to zero after weighting with @xmath21 f_ft^d=2f_ft^u .",
    "this relation is not satisfied by the quark - photon correlator in ref .",
    "[ ] , where for the proton @xmath20 and @xmath19 have opposite signs .",
    "below we shall explain in detail how to correct that model .    intuitively , the coherent contribution for scattering from @xmath6 _ vs. _ @xmath22 quarks can be understood from a mechanism similar to the lensing mechanism proposed in ref .",
    "for a transversely polarized nucleon the virtual hard photon sees @xmath6 quarks shifted towards one side of the nucleon and @xmath22 quarks to the other .",
    "when the @xmath18 knocks out a @xmath6 quark ( fig.[fig : issa ] ) , it is repelled by the negatively charged @xmath22 quarks on the other side of the nucleon . as explained above",
    "the average transverse momentum from interactions with spectator @xmath6 quarks is zero . on the other hand , when the @xmath18 knocks out a @xmath22 quark it is attracted by the positively charged @xmath6 quarks .",
    "however , since the @xmath6 and @xmath22 distributions in a transversely polarized nucleon are deformed in opposite directions , the net force from the spectators on the @xmath18 is in both cases ( knocking out @xmath6 or @xmath22 quarks ) in the same direction , i.e. there should not be a cancellation between @xmath6 and @xmath22 quarks .",

    "( [ eq : fft ] ) by rescaling the @xmath24 correlator .",
    "the latter is taken from phenomenological fits in sidis @xcite .",
    "the main steps in this rescaling are multiplication by a factor @xmath25 , multiplication by the electric charge of the spectators , and dividing by the effective color charge of the spectators .    the main reason for the violation of eq . ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) in ref .",
    "[ ] is that ( by symmetry ) the average transverse momentum resulting from fsi with spectators carrying the same flavor as the active quark should be zero @xcite , i.e. interactions with quarks from the same flavor should be omitted when estimating the matrix element in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fft ] ) .",
    "this does not affect the correlation functions for the minority falvor ( @xmath22 in proton and @xmath6 in neutron ) .",
    "however , it does affect both the qed isi & fsi as well as the qcd fsi factors when rescaling the correlation function : the electric charge entering the qed factor should only be the electric charge of the spectator flavor ( @xmath26 for the @xmath6 in proton and @xmath27 for @xmath22 in the neutron ) . for the effective color charge in the qcd fsi , only the interaction with the spectator flavor",
    "should be counted , i.e. for both @xmath6 quarks in a proton and @xmath22 quarks in a neutron that effective color charge is reduced by a factor of @xmath28 .",
    "the resulting @xmath29 correlation functions describing inclusive ssas are thus related to the relevant @xmath30 correlation functions as ( for an explanation of all factors in the rescaling see ref .",
    "[ ] f^u / p_ft(x , x)&=&gt_f^u / p(x , x ) + f^d / p_ft(x , x)&=&-gt_f^d / p(x , x ) [ eq : newfft1 ] + f^u / n_ft(x , x)&=&gt_f^d / p(x , x ) + f^d / n_ft(x , x)&=&-gt_f^u , p(x , x ) .",
    "[ eq : newfft2 ] for the neutron , the resulting change of the asymmetry is small , since only @xmath31 has changed ( increased by factor 4 ) compared to ref . [ ] . in the asymmetry , @xmath31 gets multiplied by the charge squared of the down quark and thus the asymmetry increases by only about @xmath32 .    for the proton",
    "the change is more significant , as our result for @xmath33 has a sign different from that in ref .",
    "[ ] , and there is no longer an almost complete cancellation between @xmath6 and @xmath22 contributions to @xmath34 . moreover , since the latter gets multiplied by @xmath35 , the resulting change is quite significant .",
    "in fact , we now expect an asymmetry in the proton of the same order of magnitude as that in the neutron . to see this we compare the cross section differences = = -1 , where in the last step we assumed @xmath36 consistent with a vanishing isoscalar sivers asymmetry @xcite .",
    "the predicted signs for @xmath37 are opposite to those in ref .",
    "since the famous emc experiments revealed that only a small fraction of the nucleon spin is due to quark spins@xcite , there has been a great interest in ` solving the spin puzzle ' , i.e. in decomposing the nucleon spin into contributions from quark / gluon spin and orbital degrees of freedom . in this effort",
    ", the ji decomposition@xcite @xmath38 appears to be very useful : through gpds , not only the quark spin contributions @xmath39 but also the quark total angular momenta @xmath40 ( and by subtracting the spin piece also the the quark orbital angular momenta @xmath41 ) entering this decomposition can be accessed experimentally . in the ji decomposition ( [ eq : jji ] )",
    "the quark oam is defined as the expectation value @xmath42 in a nucleon state polarized in the @xmath43 direction . here",
    "@xmath44 is the gauge - covariant derivative .",
    "the main advantages of this decomposition are that each term can be expressed as the expectation value of a manifestly gauge invariant local operator and that the quark total angular momentum @xmath45 can be related to gpds@xcite and is thus accessible in deeply virtual compton scattering and deeply virtual meson production and can also be calculated in lattice gauge theory .",
    "jaffe and manohar have proposed an alternative decomposition of the nucleon spin , which does have a partonic interpretation@xcite , and in which also two terms , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , are experimentally accessible @xmath48 in this decomposition the quark oam is defined as @xmath49",
    "wigner distributions can be defined as off forward matrix elements of non - local correlation functions@xcite with @xmath50 , @xmath51 @xmath52 throughout this paper , we will chose @xmath53 . furthermore , we will focus on the good component by selecting @xmath54 . to ensure manifest gauge invariance , a wilson line gauge link @xmath55 connecting the quark field operators at position @xmath56 and @xmath57",
    "is included .",
    "the issue of choice of path for the wilson line will be addressed below .    in terms of wigner distributions ,",
    "tmds and oam can be defined as @xcite @xmath58 no issues with the heisenberg uncertainty principle arise here since only perpendicular combinations of position @xmath59 and momentum @xmath60 are needed simultaneously in order to evaluate the integral for @xmath61 .    a straight line connecting @xmath56 and @xmath57 for the wilson line in @xmath55 results in @xcite @xmath62 however , depending on the context , other choices for the path in the wilson link @xmath63 should be made .",
    "indeed for tmds probed in sidis the path should be taken to be a straight line to @xmath64 along ( or , for regularization purposes , very close to ) the light - cone . this particular choice ensures proper inclusion of the fsi experienced by the struck quark as it leaves the nucleon along a nearly light - like trajectory in the bjorken limit .",
    "however , a wilson line to @xmath65 , for fixed @xmath66 is not yet sufficient to render wigner distributions manifestly gauge invariant , but a link at @xmath65 must be included to ensure manifest gauge invariance . while the latter may be unimportant in some gauges , it is crucial in light - cone gauge for the description of tmds relevant for sidis @xcite .",
    "let @xmath67 be the wilson path ordered exponential obtained by first taking a wilson line from @xmath68 to @xmath69 , then to @xmath70 , and then to @xmath71 , with each segment being a straight line ( fig .",

    "1.cm    ( 10,2.2)(1.2,19 )    the shape of the segment at @xmath72 is irrelevant as the gauge field is pure gauge there , but it is still necessary to include a connection at @xmath72 and for simplicity we pick a straight line . likewise , with a similar staple",
    "to @xmath73 we define the wilson path ordered exponential @xmath74 , and using those light - like gauge links , we define @xmath75 this definition for @xmath76 the same as that in ref . and similar to that of @xmath77 in ref .",
    "[ ] ( the link segment at @xmath65 was not included in the definition of @xmath77 ) .    in light - cone gauge",
    "@xmath78 , only the segment at @xmath79 contributes and the oam looks similar to the local manifestly gaguge invariant expression , except ( r ) ( r^-= , * r * _ ) . from pt invariance one finds that @xmath80 @xcite . in the bashinsky - jaffe definition of oam @xmath81@xcite ,",
    "the vector potential in the gauge covariant derivative is replaced by = , and is thus equivalent to the light - cone - staple definition _",
    "bj^q = ( l_+^q+l_-^q ) = l_+^q = l_-^q .",

    "if one fixes this residual gauge invariant by imposing anti - symmetric boundary conditions @xmath83 the vector potential at @xmath84 cancels out in @xmath85 and therefore , with the understanding of anti - symmetric boundary conditions at @xmath84 the jaffe - manohar oam becomes also identical to @xmath86 .",
    "this last observation is crucial for understanding the difference between the ji vs. jaffe - manohar oam , which in light - cone gauge involves a manifestly gauge invariant local operator , it can be evaluated in any gauge .",
    "] involves only the replacement @xmath87 . using @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the gluon field strength tensor in @xmath78 gauge .",
    "note that @xmath90 yields the @xmath91 component of the color lorentz force acting on a particle that moves with the velocity of light in the @xmath92 direction ( @xmath93 )  which is the direction of the momentum transfer in dis @xcite .",
    "thus the difference between the jaffe - manohar and ji in @xmath94 as discussed in ref .",

    "after _ it has left the nucleon and moved to @xmath97 .",
    "1.cm    ( 10,7.5)(0,13.2 )    it is easy to see that a torque as appearing in ( [ eq : torque ] ) may exist by considering the example of a quark moving through a ( color- ) magnetic dipole field caused by the spectators . because of the overall color - neutrality , this is similar to a positively charged particle moving through the magnetic field caused by negative spectators in qed .",
    "for spectator spins / oams that are oriented in the @xmath43 axis one would thus expect a dipole field as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dipole ] .",
    "all quarks ejected in the @xmath92 direction pass through the region of outward pointing radial magnetic field component , but only those originating in the bottom portion also move through regions of inward pointing radial component , i.e. for quarks ejected in the @xmath92 direction the regions of outward pointing radial component dominate .",
    "one would thus expect more torque in the @xmath92 direction than in @xmath43 direction .",
    "the observation that @xmath98 is also crucial for lattice calculations of @xmath96 : in ref . , forward",
    "matrix elements of space - like staples in fast - moving hadrons have been used for lattice calculations of tmds including fsi . by taking nonforward matrix elements of the same operators at small @xmath7 momentum transfer would enable to study @xmath96 .",
    "we identified a flaw that appears in spectator models@xcite for ssas when one considers the fsi on a quark from the majority flavor and corrected a phenomenological model for inclusive ssas .",
    "the oam appearing in the jaffe - manohar formalism is identical to wigner function based definitions of oam utilizing light - cone staples for wilson - line gauge links .",
    "we have used this result to understand the difference between the jaffe - manohar definition of oam and ji s local manifestly gauge invariant definition of oam can be related to the torque that acts on a quark in longitudinally polarized dis . in other words . , while one definition ( ji ) yields the net oam quarks _ before _ absorbing the virtual photon , the ( light - cone staple ) wigner distribution based definition ( jm ) yields the net oam after the quark has escaped to infinity .",
    "we thus now understand the physics through which these two definitions are related to one another .",
    "this is very similar to the situation in the context of tmds where the difference between the average quark transverse momentum after it has left the target ( from sivers function ) and before it has left the target ( where it is zero ) , can be related to the difference of tmds defined with a light - cone staple shaped wilson line gauge link versus one defined with a straight - line gauge link .",
    "unfortunately , no experiment has been identified to measure the oam of quarks after they have been ejected in dis .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that the above interpretation will help to develop a more complete picture of the nucleon spin .",
