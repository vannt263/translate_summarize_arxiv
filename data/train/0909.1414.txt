    "the main assumption made for the first - generation method is that the @xmath0-ray spectrum from a bin of excited states is independent of the population mechanism of these states . in the present setting",

    "the slope ( given by @xmath38 ) of the measured level density has a large uncertainty because of the estimated level density at @xmath50 , the upper anchor point of the normalization .",
    "various ways of analyzing the global set of neutron resonance spacing data may result in @xmath46 values differing by a factor of two . additionally , the uncertainty of the slope of the normalized level density is also affected if one chooses different excitation energy intervals during normalization .",
    "however , we have chosen an interval as high in excitation energy as possible with respect to reasonable errors in the data points . by choosing an interval 1 mev lower , a decrease of @xmath1935% in @xmath30 around 7 mev",

    "the normalization around 2 mev of excitation energy is settled by known levels .",
    "it has been observed in many analyzed nuclei like sc , v , fe , and mo  @xcite that level densities of neighboring isotopes show a comparable excitation energy dependence .",
    "so , in order to be more confident with our level - density normalization , the experimental data of @xmath12ti  @xcite are compared with our data of @xmath1ti , as shown in fig .",

    "the good agreement between the slopes for @xmath1ti and @xmath12ti in the energy region of 4  8 mev gives confidence to the present normalization .",
    "the level density obtained from the present experiment agrees well with the density of known discrete levels up to @xmath51 mev . at higher excitation energies ,",
    "only a part of the levels are known , mainly from transfer reactions .",
    "our experimental data points only reach up to an excitation energy of @xmath52 mev due to methodological difficulties regarding the first generation @xmath0-ray extraction procedure .",
    "the gap between our data points and @xmath46 is interpolated by the bsfg model @xmath53 where the constant @xmath54 ensures that the bsfg level density crosses the estimated @xmath46 at the neutron separation energy . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nld1 ] the bsfg level density in the extrapolated region only describes the general increase in level density and not the fine structures as described by our data .",
    "the level density of @xmath1ti shows pronounced step structures below @xmath55 mev .",
    "these structures probably correspond to the amount of energy needed to cross shell gaps and to break cooper pairs  @xcite .",
    "the gap energies are around 2  3 mev , which is similar to the energy ( @xmath56 ) required for breaking cooper pairs .",
    "thus it is very difficult to foresee the level - density fine structure in this case .    from the measurements of level density as a function of excitation energy , one can explore thermodynamic properties of the nucleus .",
    "the starting point is the entropy of the system , from which one may deduce temperature , heat capacity and single particle entropy .",

    "thus the experimentally measured level density of this work does not correspond to the true multiplicity of states , and we use multiplicity @xmath61 based on the experimental level density as : @xmath62    for the present analysis , the microcanonical ensemble has been used since hot nuclei are better described statistically through such an ensemble  @xcite . within this framework ,",

    "the normalization term @xmath66 is adjusted to fulfill the third law of thermodynamics , i.e. , @xmath67 for @xmath68 , @xmath69 being the temperature of the nucleus . using the ground state band of the even - even @xmath14ti , the normalization term is found to be @xmath70 .",
    "furthermore , the microcanonical temperature @xmath69 can be deduced from @xmath71 by @xmath72    figure  [ fig : entropy1 ] shows the variation of entropy and temperature for @xmath1ti , within a microcanonical ensemble .",
    "the variations in entropy on a linear scale with the excitation energy are equivalent to the variations in the level density on a logarithmic scale . generally , the most efficient way to generate additional states in an atomic nucleus is to break a nucleon cooper pair from its core .",
    "the resulting two nucleons may thereby be thermally excited independently to the available single - particle levels around the fermi surface .",
    "the entropy curve displays step like structures around 2 and 4 mev excitation energies that can be interpreted as the breaking of one and two nucleon pairs , respectively .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : entropy1 ] the temperature fluctuations are seen to be more pronounced than for the entropy .",
    "this is because the fine structure of the entropy curve is enhanced in the temperature @xmath69 curve due to the differentiation . in spite of these fluctuations",

    "the enhanced bump structures in the temperature spectra can be interpreted as the breaking of nucleon pairs .",
    "when particle pairs are broken , new degrees of freedom open up leading to an increase of @xmath39 and decrease in temperature @xmath75 . in the temperature plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : entropy1 ] one can notice locations of negative slopes .",
    "the first such location appears at @xmath76 2.0 mev which should be compared with twice the proton pairing gap parameter @xmath77 of @xmath1ti , the minimum required energy to break a proton cooper pair .",
    "following the definition of  @xcite one gets @xmath78 mev , which is comparable to the location of the first temperature drop .",
    "the second location of a temperature drop occurs around @xmath79 mev which can be interpreted as the onset of the four quasi - particle regime .",

    "[ fig : nld1 ] .",
    "the figure shows that the bsfg model level density does not reproduce the detailed structures in the experimental level density .",
