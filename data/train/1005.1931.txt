    "according to the no - hair theorem , the external spacetimes of black holes are uniquely characterized by their masses and spins ( israel 1967 , 1968 ; carter 1971 , 1973 ; hawking 1972 ; robinson 1975 ) .",
    "this theorem requires that the cosmic censorship conjecture ( penrose 1969 ) holds and that the exterior spacetime is free of closed time - like curves . under these assumptions ,",
    "all astrophysical black holes should be fully described by the kerr metric ( kerr 1963 ) .",
    "it is widely accepted that the universe contains an abundance of black holes as inferred from the observations of the centers of nearby galaxies ( e.g. , tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ) , of our own galactic center ( ghez et al . 2008",
    "; gillessen et al .",
    "2009 ) , and of many galactic binaries ( e.g. , mcclintock & remillard 2006 ) . nonetheless , the factual existence of an event horizon is yet unproven and has only been inferred indirectly ( e.g. , narayan , garcia , & mcclintock 1997 , 2001 ; narayan & heyl 2002 ; mcclintock , narayan , & rybicki 2004 ; see also psaltis 2006 ) .",
    "alternative explanations for the nature of these objects have been suggested , which include naked singularities ( manko & novikov 1992 ) , exotic stellar objects ( friedberg , lee , & pang 1987 ; mazur & mottola 2001 ; barcel et al .",
    "2008 ) , as well as a breakdown of general relativity itself on horizon scales ( e.g. , yunes & pretorius 2009 ; c.f .",
    "psaltis et al .",
    "2008 ) .    a test of the no - hair theorem",
    "can both identify the observed dark compact objects with kerr black holes and verify the validity of general relativity in the strong - field regime .",
    "indeed , within general relativity , if a compact object is not a kerr black hole , then its external spacetime will not satisfy the no - hair theorem .",
    "alternatively , if general relativity is not valid in the strong - field regime , the external spacetime of a compact object that is surrounded by a horizon may violate the no - hair theorem ( see , however , psaltis et al .",
    "mass and spin are the first two multipole moments of a black - hole spacetime .",
    "if the no - hair theorem is correct , then all higher multipole moments only depend on the mass and spin , and any deviation from the kerr moments has to be zero .",
    "consequently , the no - hair theorem can be tested by measuring ( at least ) three multipole moments of such a spacetime ( ryan 1995 ) .    in part",
    "i of this series of papers ( johannsen & psaltis 2010 ; hereafter paper i ) , we investigated a framework for testing the no - hair theorem with observations of compact objects in the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "based on a quasi - kerr spacetime that contains an independent quadrupole moment ( glampedakis & babak 2006 ) , we analyzed in detail the spacetime properties that are critical for such observations as a function of the mass , spin , and quadrupole moment .",
    "we showed that already very moderate changes of the quadrupole moment lead to significant alterations of various quantities that determine observables .",
    "in particular , we explored the effect of changing the quadrupole moment on the locations of the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) and of the circular photon orbit , as well as on the lensing and redshift of photons .",
    "there has been , already , substantial work on potential tests of the no - hair theorem with observations of gravitational waves from extreme mass - ratio inspirals ( ryan 1995 , 1997a , 1997b ; barack & cutler 2004 , 2007 ; collins & hughes 2004 ; glampedakis & babak 2006 ; gair et al .  2008 ; li & lovelace 2008 ; apostolatos et al .",
    "2009 ; vigeland & hughes 2010 ) . in this series of papers",
    ", we show that observations of black holes in the electromagnetic spectrum may also allow for a clean test of the no - hair theorem . in particular ,",
    "we identify different observables that probe the quadrupole moments of the spacetimes but depend very weakly on the usual astrophysical complications , such as the flow geometry , the mode of emission , and the variability of the accretion flows that generate the photons we detect from black holes .",
    "imaging observations of accreting black holes at ( sub@xmath2)mm wavelengths using very - long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) promise to enable unprecedented views of the vicinities of black - hole horizons .",
    "recent vlbi - observations along only three baselines resolved sgr  a@xmath3 , the black hole in the center of the milky way , on a scale comparable to its event horizon and provided evidence for sub - horizon scale structures ( doeleman et al .",
    "2008 ) as well as for the presence of an event horizon ( broderick , loeb , & narayan 2009 ) .",
    "far greater resolution can be achieved by adding either existing or planned telescopes located at various places on the earth ( fish & doeleman 2009 ) . the black hole in the center of m87 ( broderick & loeb 2009 ) as well as a small number of other nearby supermassive black holes ( psaltis 2008 ) offer additional targets for horizon - scale imaging that can be utilized in the near future .",
    "imaging observations are expected to be able to resolve the shadows of black holes and lead to the determination of their spins and inclinations ( falcke et al .",
    "2000 ; broderick & loeb 2005 , 2006 ; fish & doeleman 2009 ) .",
    "templates for images of accretion flows around kerr black holes within general relativity that are suitable to these observations have been reported by a number of authors ( bardeen 1973 ; speith et al .",
    "1995 ; fanton et al . 1997 ; falcke et al .",
    "2000 ; takahashi 2004 ; beckwith & done 2004 , 2005 ; dexter & agol 2009 ; broderick & loeb 2005 , 2006 ; yuan et al . 2009 ) .",
    "recently , bambi & freese ( 2009 ) explored the possibility of using black - hole images to test whether black holes violate the kerr bound @xmath4 .    in this paper",
    ", we study the properties of the images of compact objects that violate the no - hair theorem using the quasi - kerr formalism we developed in paper i. we calculate numerically the mapping between locations in the vicinity of a black hole and positions in the observer s sky using the mass , spin , and quadrupole moment of the spacetime as independent parameters .",
    "we investigate the impact of varying the quadrupole moment on the properties of this mapping and show that the images of the accretion flows around compact objects that violate the no - hair theorem are expected to have prolate or oblate geometries .",
    "measuring the spacetime moments from the images of an accretion flow will be , of course , very model dependent and limited by our lack of understanding of the intrinsic geometry of the flow itself .",
    "for example , prolate images of the inner accretion may be the result of resolving the formation region of a jet and not of a violation of the no - hair theorem ( see , e.g. , broderick & loeb 2009 ) .",
    "moreover , a measurement of the spin from an image of the shadow alone is difficult ( e.g. , falcke et al . 2000 ; takahashi 2004 ) and might require complementary observations such as a multiwavelength study of polarization ( broderick & loeb 2006 ; see also schnittman & krolik 2009 , 2010 )",
    ".    additionally , accretion flows are very turbulent and variable at timescales much shorter than the rotation period of the earth , which sets the characteristic integration time for an interferometric imaging observation .",
    "if this time variability is produced by a highly coherent , orbiting inhomogeneity in the accretion flow , it may allow measuring the properties of the compact object via non - imaging techniques ( doeleman et al .",
    "the variability , however , will limit and may prohibit altogether the ability of obtaining a clean image of the accretion flow .",
    "the images of optically thin accretion flows around black holes , however , reveal a characteristic bright ring at the projected radius of the circular photon orbit along null geodesics ( beckwith & done 2005 ) with properties that remain constant even as the underlying accretion flows are highly variable .",
    "this bright ring is the result of the light rays that orbit around the black hole many times before they reach the distant observer , and , therefore , have a much larger path length through the optically thin accretion flow .",
    "these photons can make a significant contribution to the total disk emission and produce higher - order images ( cunningham 1976 ; laor , netzer , & piran 1990 ; viergutz 1993 ; bao , hadrava , & stgaard 1994 ; @xmath5 , fanton , & calvani 1998 ; agol & krolik 2000 ; beckwith & done 2005 ) .",
    "we use our formalism to show that the bright emission ring is circular for a schwarzschild black hole and remains nearly circular for kerr black holes . on the other hand ,",
    "if the quadrupole moment is left as an independent parameter , the ring shape changes significantly and becomes asymmetric .",
    "the degree of asymmetry is a direct measure of the violation of the no - hair theorem .",
    "we show that the diameter of the ring depends only very weakly on the spin and quadrupole moment of the black hole and can be used to directly measure the mass of the object . in addition",
    ", the ring is displaced off center in the image plane in the case of rotating black holes ( beckwith & done 2005 ; see , also , takahashi 2004 ) , and we show that the displacement is a direct measure of the object s spin , modulo the disk inclination .    in section  2",
    "we briefly review the framework for testing the no - hair theorem with observations in the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "we simulate images of black holes and of the photon rings in sections  3 and 4 , respectively , and show how they depend on the mass , spin , and quadrupole moment of a given black hole . in section  5",
    "we quantify these dependencies before we discuss our results and their implications for future observations in section  6 .",
    "the no - hair theorem establishes the claim that astrophysical black holes are uniquely characterized by their mass @xmath6 and spin @xmath7 , i.e. , by only the first two multipole moments of their exterior spacetimes ( israel 1967 , 1968 ; carter 1971 , 1973 ; hawking 1972 ; robinson 1975 ) . as a consequence of the no - hair theorem , all higher order moments are already fully determined and obey the relation ( geroch 1970 ; hansen 1974 )",
    "@xmath8 here , @xmath9 is the spin parameter , and the multipole moments are written as a set of mass multipole moments @xmath10 which are nonzero for even values of @xmath11 and as a set of current multipole moments @xmath12 which are nonzero for odd values of @xmath11 .",
    "the zeroth order mass moment is equal to the mass of the black hole , @xmath13 , whereas the first order current moment is its angular momentum , @xmath14 .",
    "this theorem is based on two technical assumptions .",
    "first , any spacetime singularity must be enclosed by an event horizon ( the cosmic censorship conjecture , penrose 1969 ) , and second , there exist no closed timelike loops in the exterior domain of the black hole",
    ".    the no - hair theorem can be tested by measuring ( at least ) three different multipole moments , which have to be related by expression ( [ kerrmult ] ) if this theorem is correct ( ryan 1995 ) . in paper",
    "i , we investigated a framework for extracting three multipole moments of a black - hole spacetime with observations in the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "we used a quasi - kerr metric ( glampedakis & babak 2006 ) , which incorporates an independent quadrupole moment and parameterizes a potential deviation from the kerr quadrupole in terms of the parameter @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath16 this reduces smoothly to the kerr quadrupole moment in the limit @xmath17 in accordance with relation ( [ kerrmult ] ) .    if the no - hair theorem is valid , then @xmath18 .",
    "if , however , a nonzero value of the parameter @xmath15 is measured , then the compact object can not be a general - relativistic black hole .",
    "within general relativity , it may be a different type of star or an exotic configuration of matter ( see collins & hughes 2004 ; hughes 2006 ) .",
    "on the other hand , if the compact object is otherwise known to possess an event horizon and a regular spacetime , then a nonzero value of the parameter @xmath15 implies that the no - hair theorem is incorrect and general relativity does not accurately describe the near - horizon spacetimes of black holes .    in paper",
    "i , we showed that the observable properties of this quasi - kerr spacetime depend significantly on the parameter @xmath15 in the vicinity of the black hole .",
    "in particular , we demonstrated that the radius of the isco increases by @xmath020% for a value of the quadrupolar correction @xmath19 at a spin @xmath20 .",
    "since the isco marks the inner edge of the accretion disk , it critically impacts the high - energy part of the emitted disk spectrum .",
    "furthermore , we showed that the circular photon orbit experiences a shift of similar magnitude and that the observed redshift of a photon emitted by a particle on the isco decreases by @xmath025% for values of the quadrupolar parameter @xmath21 and spin @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "in addition , we demonstrated the effects of changing the quadrupole moment on the strong lensing experienced by photons in the neighborhood of the black hole .    for nonzero values of the parameter @xmath15 , the quasi - kerr metric is a solution of the einstein equations up to the quadrupole order and ,",
    "therefore , can only be used for values of the spin @xmath22 and of the radius larger than a cutoff that depends on both the spin and the quadrupole moment . for reasonable perturbations of the quadrupole",
    ", however , the cutoff always lies inside of the circular photon orbit and plays only a very minor role in our analysis .",
    "the requirement that the spin is not near the maximal kerr value allows us to apply this method to images of sgr  a@xmath23 , for which first , although uncertain estimates from millimeter vlbi observations indicate that the black hole is not spinning rapidly ( broderick et al .",
    "in this section , we calculate numerically the mapping between different locations in the accretion flow around a quasi - kerr black hole and the observer s sky and discuss its characteristics .",
    "this mapping depends significantly on the value of the parameter @xmath15 due to the modifications in the spacetime properties discussed in paper  i , such as their effects on the light bending and redshift experienced by photons , as well as on the location of the isco and the photon orbit .    .",
    "the image plane of a distant observer is located at a distance @xmath24 from the black hole , at an inclination angle @xmath25 , and with its center on the @xmath26@xmath27 plane .",
    "photon trajectories are integrated backwards starting on the image plane at coordinates @xmath28 with uniform initial momentum vector @xmath29 at a distance @xmath30 from the black hole.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we developed an algorithm that maps any initial configuration of photons around the black hole into the plane of the sky viewed by a distant observer .",
    "we integrate the full second - order geodesic equations in the quasi - kerr spacetime via a fourth - order runge - kutta method with adaptive stepsize .",
    "figure  [ geometry ] shows the geometry we use .",
    "the image plane is located at a distance @xmath24 away from the black hole , at an inclination angle @xmath25 , and with its center on the @xmath26-@xmath27 plane .",
    "we integrate photon trajectories backwards starting on the image plane and terminating at the surface of last scattering in the accretion flow . modeling the thermodynamic properties of the accretion flow and integrating the radiative transfer equation",
    "is beyond the scope of this paper . in this section ,",
    "we assume for simplicity that the last scattering surface of the photons is in the equatorial plane around the black hole , on the surface of an infinitesimally thin accretion disk . in the next section",
    ", we will discuss the situation in which the accretion flow is optically thin , as is expected to be the case for sgr  a@xmath23 at sub - mm wavelengths .    as an initial condition",
    ", we distribute the photons in a square grid on the image plane with a spacing of @xmath31 .",
    "we set their initial 3-momentum vectors @xmath32 to be perpendicular to the image plane and uniform ( see appendix  a ) . in order to visualize the mapping between the plane of the accretion disk and the observer s sky we consider a set of concentric equatorial target rings that extend from @xmath33 to @xmath34 in steps of @xmath35 .",
    "since the images are scale - invariant with respect to the mass of the black hole , we express all physical quantities in units of mass . in all calculations",
    "we have imposed a cutoff at @xmath33 in accordance with the range of validity of the metric ( see paper  i ) , and we terminate the integration if a photon enters the excluded region @xmath36 .",
    "we plot on the image plane only those photons that reach one of the target rings in the accretion disk .    in figure  [ bhimages ] we plot images of black holes with spin @xmath20 viewed from a distant observer at an inclination angle @xmath37 for values of the quadrupolar parameter ( from left to right ) @xmath38 .",
    "the images consist of the projection of the target rings onto the observer s sky .",
    "the rings are distorted by light bending .",
    "gravitational redshift , doppler boosting , and beaming play no role in these images , because we have not incorporated in our calculation the evolution of the radiative intensity . in all images ,",
    "the centers of the deformed rings are shifted to the left due to frame dragging .",
    "the effect of changing the quadrupole moment on the images is only apparent at small radii . in figure  [ r2 ]",
    "we show explicitly how violating the no - hair theorem alters the images of the innermost rings we considered , i.e. , the ones at @xmath33 , for a schwarzschild black hole and a kerr black hole with @xmath20 . in both cases , we set the inclination to @xmath37 and display the innermost ring for three values of the parameter @xmath38 . for the perturbed schwarzschild black hole",
    ", increasing the value of the parameter @xmath15 makes the projected ring more oblate , because of the increased amount of gravitational lensing experienced by the photons ( see paper  i ) . in the case of nonzero spin ,",
    "a change in the quadrupole moment also affects the left - right asymmetry of the image and especially its right edge that corresponds to the receding part of the accretion disk .",
    "increasing the value of the parameter @xmath15 leads to a wider image .",
    "the dependence of the black - hole images on their quadrupole moments that we investigated in the previous section allows us , in principle , to use imaging observations to map the properties of their spacetimes . in practice",
    ", however , the change in the oblateness of even the closest rings to the black - hole horizons is very modest and can be masked by anisotropies in the emission from the accretion flow and its variability . unless an orbiting density inhomogeneity ( a `` hot spot '' ) can be securely identified and imaged throughout its orbit ( e.g. , broderick & loeb 2005 ) , time - averaged overall images of black - hole accretion disks may appear _ a priori _ not well suited for testing the no - hair theorem .",
    "there is , however , an observable structure in the images of optically thin accretion flows around black holes that suffers only marginally from astrophysical complications and carries very strong signatures of the quadrupole moments of the underlying spacetimes .",
    "consider a geometrically thick accretion flow imaged at a wavelength at which the emission is optically thin ; this is the case for sgr  a@xmath23 at sub - mm wavelengths .",
    "the brightness of the image at any given point in the observer s sky will depend on the length of the optical path along the corresponding light ray that passes through the region of high emissivity in the accretion flow .",
    "most light rays that originate from the image plane either emerge on the far side of the black hole , after experiencing gravitational bending , or intercept the black - hole horizon .",
    "a small set of light rays , however , that approach the event horizon orbit closely around the black hole several times before they escape towards the far side and can , therefore , make a significant contribution to the total flux ( cunningham 1976 ; laor , netzer , & piran 1990 ; viergutz 1993 ; bao , hadrava , & stgaard 1994 ; @xmath5 , fanton , & calvani 1998 ; agol & krolik 2000 ; beckwith & done 2005 ) .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ ringorbits ] , which shows the paths of a number of light rays that approach the horizon of a black hole from the top right corner at an inclination of @xmath37 relative to the spin axis @xmath27 .",
    "these light rays orbit several times around the black - hole horizon at nearly constant radius ( see , also , bardeen 1973 ) .",
    "the integral of the emissivity along these light rays is very large , compared to that along nearby light rays , and results in a significant increase in the brightness at their footpoints on the image plane .",
    "the locus of the footpoints of these light rays on the image plane is a ring .",
    "this leads to the emergence of a ring in images of optically thin accretion flows that is substantially brighter than the background and whose shape and position in the image plane depend on the spin of the black hole and on the inclination of the accretion disk ( beckwith & done 2005 ) .",
    "such bright rings of emission are clearly visible in the images of all time - dependent general relativistic simulations of accretion flows reported to date ( see , e.g. , the right panel of fig .  5 in mo@xmath39cibrodzka et al .",
    "2009 ; panels 1 and 3 in fig .  1 in dexter , agol , & fragile 2009 ; fig .  1 in shcherbakov & penna 2010 ) .        in this section ,",
    "we demonstrate that the bright rings of emission ( hereafter photon rings ) carry an unmistakable signature of the black - hole spacetime and , in particular , of its quadrupole moment . in order",
    "to study the sizes and shapes of these rings in different configurations , in a way that is independent of the physical conditions in the accretion flow , we use the following working definition of the position of the bright photon rings on the image plane : we identify them with the locus of footpoints of those light rays that leave the observer perpendicular to the image plane and cross the equatorial plane of the black hole at least twice , before emerging on the opposite side .    . ,",
    "scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we first consider the dependence of the position of the photon rings on the spin of a kerr black hole , i.e. , of one that satisfies the no - hair theorem .",
    "figure  [ ringkerr ] shows that increasing the spin leads to a substantial displacement of the centroid of the photon ring with respect to the geometric center of the spacetime .",
    "this displacement is @xmath40 for even moderate ( @xmath41 ) values of the spin and can be as large as @xmath42 for maximally rotating black holes .",
    "the striking property of these rings , however , is the fact that their shapes remain practically circular for values of the spin @xmath1 , even though the geometry of the kerr spacetime is highly non - spherically symmetric . only at the maximum spin ,",
    "the receding part of the photon ring becomes asymmetric . even in this extreme case , however ,",
    "the maximum difference between the major and minor axes of the ring is only @xmath43 .",
    "note here that , for the case @xmath44 , the radius of the circular photon orbit almost coincides with the event horizon , which introduces a noticeable numerical error on the rightmost part of the ring ; for this reason , we use a short - dashed line to represent this uncertainty .",
    "the symmetry of the photon rings changes significantly if the no - hair theorem is violated and the quadrupole moment of the spacetime takes on a non - kerr value . in figure  [ rings ] , we show the photon rings for a ( quasi@xmath2)schwarzschild and a ( quasi@xmath2)kerr black hole with spin @xmath20 and for three different values of the quadrupolar correction @xmath38 . as the degree of violation of the no - hair theorem increases , the photon ring around a static black hole becomes oblate or prolate ( depending on the sign of the parameter @xmath15 ) , while its geometric center remains the same . in the case of a spinning black hole , frame dragging introduces an additional asymmetry between the approaching and the receding parts of the ring . for the spinning black holes with a value of the quadrupolar parameter @xmath45",
    ", the rightmost part of the ring corresponds to photons that propagate in a region of spacetime in which our perturbative approach breaks down ; we , therefore , indicated this uncertainty using a long - dashed line .    in both cases shown in figure  [ rings ] ,",
    "the difference between the major and minor axes of the photon rings is @xmath46 , even for modest degrees of violation of the no - hair theorem .",
    "the degree of asymmetry increases with increasing inclination and vanishes when the black hole is viewed pole on .",
    "the oblateness and asymmetry of the bright photon rings in the images of accreting black holes carries , therefore , a quantitative measure of the degree of violation of the no - hair theorem , modulo the inclination of the observer .",
    "we systematically analyze the impact of the mass , spin , quadrupolar parameter , and disk inclination on the shape and position of the ring in the next section .     between the quadrupole moment of the spacetime and its kerr value .",

    "expression ( [ asymmetryformula ] ) implies that the maximum asymmetry of a kerr black hole is @xmath72 . in the event that an asymmetry larger than this value is detected , which is already possible for moderate deviations of the quadrupole moment from the value of a kerr quadrupole moment ( c.f .",
    ", figure  [ asymmetryfits ] , bottom panel ) , then the compact object can not be a kerr black hole .    in order to test the no - hair theorem ,",
    "it is necessary to measure ( at least ) three multipole moments of the spacetime ( ryan 1995 ) . in the following",
    "we argue that a measurement of the diameter of the ring determines the mass of the central object and that for a given disk inclination the displacement and the asymmetry of the ring directly measure the spin @xmath48 and the parameter @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the degree of asymmetry is a direct measure of the violation of the no - hair theorem .    in figure  [ ringstatistics ] , we plot ( left panel ) the diameter of the photon ring as a function of the spin @xmath48 for values of the inclination @xmath73 .",
    "dashed lines correspond to a quasi - kerr black hole with a value of the parameter @xmath19 .",
    "the solid line corresponds to a kerr black hole . in all cases , the diameter is practically independent of the spin @xmath48 .",
    "for a kerr black hole , the diameter also depends only very weakly on the disk inclination and is almost constant for spins in the range @xmath74 with a value of @xmath75 even for large values of the spin , the diameter depends only weakly on the inclination angle causing a systematic uncertainty of only @xmath76 for a value of the spin as large as @xmath77 . for a quasi - kerr black hole ,",
    "the diameter is affected by the parameter @xmath15 and the inclination which leads to a systematic uncertainty of @xmath78 if @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , a measurement of the ring diameter directly measures the mass of the central object .    in figure  [ ringstatistics ] ,",
    "we also plot ( center panel ) the ring displacement of a quasi - kerr black hole versus @xmath79 for values of the inclination angle @xmath73 and of the parameter @xmath65 .",
    "the solid lines in this figure represent the extreme limits of the fit function given by expression ( [ displacementformula ] ) corresponding to @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "finally , in figure  [ ringstatistics ] ( right panel ) , we show the ring asymmetry of quasi - kerr black holes versus @xmath81 for values of the spin @xmath74 and of the inclination angle @xmath73 .",
    "the solid line is expression ( [ asymmetryformula ] ) evaluated at @xmath82 .",
    "thus , for a given disk inclination , an observation of the displacement and the asymmetry directly leads to a measurement of the spin @xmath48 and quadrupolar correction parameter @xmath15 via the expressions in equations ( [ displacementformula ] ) and ( [ asymmetryformula ] ) , respectively .",
    "a measurement of the asymmetry allows for a test of the no - hair theorem . in order to determine the displacement it is necessary to measure the center of mass of the accretion flow around the black hole .",
    "an estimate of the location of the center of mass may perhaps be obtained from a ( time - averaged ) image of the outer edges of the accretion flow .",
    "in paper  i , we proposed a new framework for testing the no - hair theorem with observations of black holes in the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "we formulated our tests based on a quasi - kerr metric ( glampedakis & babak 2006 ) , which deviates smoothly from the kerr metric in the quadrupole moment .",
    "since the no - hair theorem admits exactly two independent multipole moments for a black hole , a measurement of these three moments will allow us to test the no - hair theorem .    in this paper",
    ", we calculated numerically the mapping between different locations in the accretion flow around a quasi - kerr black hole and positions in the image plane of a distant observer .",
    "our calculations allowed us to study the potential of using imaging observations of black holes , that will become available in the near future , in order to test the no - hair theorem .",
    "we argued that the expected image of an accretion flow will be characterized by a bright emission ring generated by light rays that circle multiple times around the event horizon before emerging towards the observer .",
    "we identified the ring diameter as a direct measure of the mass of the black hole , and we quantified the dependence of the displacement and the asymmetry of the ring on the spin and the quadrupolar parameter as well as on the disk inclination . for a given inclination angle ,",
    "a measurement of the displacement and the asymmetry directly measures the spin and the quadrupolar parameter of the system , respectively .",
    "the asymmetry itself provides a direct measure of the violation of the no - hair theorem .",
    "it is important to emphasize here that only the relative displacement and asymmetry of the ring ( i.e. , measured in units of the ring diameter ) and not their absolute values are necessary in inferring the spin and quadrupole moment of the black - hole spacetime . as a result ,",
    "the outcome of such an observation does not depend on the distance to the black hole , which might not be known accurately . on the other hand ,",
    "the angular diameter of the photon ring is proportional to the mass of the black hole .",
    "this can lead to an accurate measurement of the mass of the black hole if the distance is known , or else of the distance to the black hole , if its mass is known from , e.g. , dynamical observations .",
    "sgr a * , the black hole in the center of the milky way , is the ideal candidate for a test of the no - hair theorem due to its high brightness , large angular size , and relatively unimpeded observational accessibility .",
    "recent vlbi observations ( doeleman et al . 2008 ) resolved sgr a * on horizon scales .",
    "incorporating additional baselines to the vlbi network will lead to the first images of sgr  a@xmath23 within the next few years ( fish & doeleman 2009 ) .",
    "the emission from sgr  a@xmath23 at sub - mm wavelengths is optically thin , the size of the scattering ellipse is @xmath83 , and the resolution of a vlbi image at this wavelength is also comparable to @xmath40 ( doeleman et al .",
    "2008 ; fish & doeleman 2009 ) .",
    "the smearing of the images due to scattering and the finite resolution of the array will , therefore , not preclude measuring the position and asymmetry of the photon ring to an accuracy that is adequate in providing a quantitative test of the no - hair theorem .",
    "observations of the orbits of stars in the vicinity of the black hole have provided an independent measurement of its mass ( ghez et al .",
    "2008 ; gillessen et al .  2009 ) .",
    "perhaps more importantly , the same observations may lead in the future to an independent measurement of the spin and orientation of the black hole , as well as to a complementary test of the no - hair theorem ( will 2008 ; merritt et al .",
    "2010 ) .",

    "for the geometry in figure [ geometry ] , the initial conditions of the photons in the image plane of a distant observer are better expressed in spherical coordinates .",
    "the image plane is located at a distance @xmath24 from the black hole at an inclination angle @xmath25 .",
    "since the observer is far away from the black hole , we can express the initial conditions using standard euclidean geometry .",
