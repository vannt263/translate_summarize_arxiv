    "recently , a number of resonance searches at the @xmath4 tev lhc have reported a handful of excess events around invariant mass of 1.8  2 tev .",
    "the most significant ones are : ( i ) a @xmath5 local ( @xmath6 global ) excess in the atlas search  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for the corresponding cms searches reporting a mild excess at the same mass ) for a heavy resonance decaying into a pair of standard model ( sm ) gauge bosons @xmath7 ( with @xmath8 ) ; ( ii ) a @xmath9 excess in the cms search  @xcite for a heavy right - handed ( rh ) gauge boson @xmath0 decaying into an electron and rh neutrino @xmath10 , whose further decay gives an @xmath11 final state ; ( iii ) a @xmath12 excess in the cms search  @xcite for @xmath13 , where the sm higgs boson @xmath14 decays into @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( with @xmath17 ) ; ( iv ) a @xmath18 excess in the cms dijet search  @xcite .",
    "these excesses of course need to be confirmed with more statistics at the lhc run ii before any firm conclusion about their origin can be derived . nevertheless , taking them as possible indications of new physics beyond the sm , it is worthwhile to examine whether all of them could be simultaneously explained within a self - consistent , ultra - violet complete theory that could be tested in foreseeable future .",
    "one class of models that seems to broadly fit the observed features in all the above - mentioned channels is the left - right symmetric model ( lrsm ) of weak interactions based on the gauge group @xmath19  @xcite , with the rh charged gauge boson mass @xmath20 tev and with @xmath21 at the tev - scale  @xcite , @xmath22 being the @xmath23 gauge coupling strength . within this framework",
    ", the @xmath11 excess  @xcite can be understood  @xcite as @xmath24  @xcite and is related to the type - i seesaw mechanism  @xcite for neutrino masses .",
    "the @xmath25 excess  @xcite and @xmath26 excess  @xcite can be understood  @xcite in terms of @xmath27 , since these couplings naturally arise in these models from the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the bidoublet field used to generate quark and lepton masses  @xcite ( see  @xcite for some alternative explanations of the diboson excess ) .",
    "finally , the dijet excess  @xcite can simply be due to @xmath28 .    however , a particular aspect of the observations in the @xmath11 channel , namely , a suppression of same - sign electron pairs with respect to opposite - sign pairs  @xcite , can not be explained within the minimal lrsm with type - i seesaw mechanism . this is because of the fact that for a type - i seesaw interpretation of the @xmath11 excess , one expects equal number of same and opposite - sign dileptons due to the purely majorana nature of the rh neutrinos ( see  @xcite for an exception , when the interference of two non - degenerate rh majorana neutrinos with mixed flavor content and opposite @xmath29 parities can partially suppress the same - sign dilepton signal )",
    "thus , a heavy pseudo - dirac neutrino , as naturally occurs in the inverse seesaw mechanism  @xcite , seems to be the simplest possibility to explain the suppression of same - sign dilepton events in both cms  @xcite and atlas  @xcite searches .",
    "the main result of this letter is that if the difference between same and opposite - sign dilepton signal becomes statistically significant , it more likely suggests an inverse seesaw interpretation rather than a type - i seesaw in a left - right ( lr ) model",
    ". note that in the original inverse seesaw proposal  @xcite , the lepton number violation is small , being directly proportional to the light neutrino masses , and hence , it is rather unlikely to have _ any _ same - sign dilepton events in this scenario .",
    "in this letter , we show that there exists a class of inverse seesaw models where the heavy neutrinos are still majorana fermions with non - negligible lepton number violation , without affecting the inverse seesaw neutrino mass formula . in this class of models , it is possible to accommodate a _",
    "non - zero _ same - sign dilepton signal , while being consistent with the suppression with respect to the opposite - sign signal .",
    "in particular , a statistically significant non - zero ratio of same and opposite - sign dilepton signal events could be used to test the relative strength between the dirac and majorana nature of the heavy neutrinos at the lhc .",
    "another important result of this letter is that our tev - scale lrsm with inverse seesaw unifies to an @xmath30 grand unified theory ( gut ) at a high scale @xmath31 gev without introducing any other intermediate scales , which is remarkable for a non - supersymmetric theory .",
    "this is achieved with a minimal tev - scale particle content , which predicts the value of @xmath1 at the tev - scale , thus naturally satisfying the requirement @xmath21 to explain the excess events mentioned above .",
    "moreover , such a single - step unification without introducing supersymmetry ( susy ) also requires the existence of @xmath2-triplet fermions , which can naturally act as the dark matter of the universe  @xcite .",
    "finally , this model could also explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe via leptogenesis through the out - of - equilibrium decay of the heavy majorana neutrinos , while avoiding the stringent leptogenesis bounds on @xmath32  @xcite due to suppressed @xmath0-induced washout in this case  @xcite .",
    "as in the usual lrsm  @xcite , denoting @xmath33 and @xmath34 as the quark and lepton doublets respectively , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are doublets under @xmath37 , while @xmath38 and @xmath39 are @xmath3 doublets . to implement the inverse seesaw mechanism  @xcite",
    ", we add three gauge - singlet fermions @xmath40 .",
    "the minimal higgs sector of the model consists of an @xmath41 bidoublet @xmath42 , an @xmath3-doublet @xmath43 and @xmath3-triplet @xmath44 . the gauge symmetry @xmath45 is broken to @xmath46 by the triplet vev @xmath47 , as well as the doublet vev @xmath48 , whereas the bidoublet vev @xmath49 breaks the sm gauge group @xmath50 to @xmath51 .",
    "the lh counterparts ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) are assumed to be at the gut scale , following  broken @xmath54-parity \" models  @xcite .",
    "the yukawa lagrangian of the model is given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 stand for the fermion generations , @xmath57 for charge conjugation and @xmath58 ( @xmath59 being the second pauli matrix ) .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , the dirac fermion masses are given by the generic formula @xmath60 for up - type fermions , while for down - type quarks and charged - leptons , it is the same formula with @xmath61 .",
    "( [ eq : yuk ] ) leads to the dirac mass matrix for neutrinos : @xmath62 .",
    "the rh neutrinos @xmath10 and their singlet partners @xmath63 generate a dirac mass term @xmath64 , while the rh neutrinos also get a majorana mass @xmath65 .",
    "thus , the generalized inverse seesaw neutrino mass matrix in the flavor basis @xmath66 is given by  @xcite @xmath67 at tree - level , the majorana entry @xmath68 in eq .",
    "does not affect the light neutrino masses , which are only proportional to @xmath69 .",
    "however , standard electroweak radiative corrections  @xcite give an one - loop contribution proportional to @xmath70 , where the loop - factor is given by  @xcite @xmath71\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath72 .",
    "combining the tree and loop contributions , we can write an effective light neutrino majorana mass which , in the one - generation case , becomes @xmath73 more importantly , the other two mass eigenstates which are linear combinations of @xmath74 and @xmath63 are also majorana fermions . denoting them by @xmath75 , we get the corresponding masses from eq .  : @xmath76 \\ ; , \\label{nu2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have assumed that @xmath77 and @xmath78 , as suggested by eq .  .",
    "from eq .  , we see that for @xmath79 , @xmath80 form a pseudo - dirac pair , as in the usual inverse seesaw case . in the other extreme limit @xmath81 , @xmath82 is purely majorana with @xmath83 as in the type - i seesaw , whereas @xmath84 will have a mass proportional to @xmath69 .",
    "thus , for intermediate values of @xmath68 , we can have scenarios with varying degree of lepton number breaking .",
    "this has important consequences for lepton number violating signals in colliders ( see below ) , as well as in neutrinoless double beta decay experiments  @xcite .",
    "the charged - current lagrangian in the rh sector is given by @xmath85 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\qquad \\qquad + { \\rm h.c .",
    "} , \\label{eq : cc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 denotes the mixing between the mass eigenstates @xmath87 and the flavor eigenstate @xmath88 , and @xmath89 is the mixing angle between @xmath80 with @xmath90 .    for dilepton final states ,",
    "we observe from eq .",
    "that for @xmath91 , the on - shell production of @xmath0 in the @xmath92 collisions at the lhc is followed by its decay to an admixture of the mass eigenstates @xmath80 and their subsequent decay to @xmath93 .",
    "thus , for @xmath94 for the @xmath88 flavor , we do not expect to see a single peak in the @xmath93 invariant mass distribution , which could naturally explain the absence of such a peak in the cms data  @xcite .",
    "also for @xmath95 , the heavy neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath80 in eq .",
    "have masses of opposite sign , which means that one of them is odd under @xmath29 transformation  @xcite , while the other is even under @xmath29 . hence , there will be a relative sign between the amplitudes of the processes for opposite - sign ( @xmath96 ) and same - sign ( @xmath97 ) dilepton final states .",
    "the ratio of the amplitudes is given by @xmath98 where we have used the field theoretic method of  @xcite to account for the coherent mixing of the two propagating mass eigenstates @xmath80 .",
    "implies that unlike the type - i seesaw case , the number of same - sign and opposite - sign dilepton events can be different in our case and the ratio @xmath99 , which can be anywhere between 0 and 1 , will be a measure of the relative magnitude of the two entries @xmath68 ( majorana ) and @xmath100 ( dirac ) in the inverse seesaw mass matrix  .",
    "this can therefore provide a plausible mechanism for understanding a non - zero but smaller number of same - sign dilepton events than the opposite - sign dilepton events , as observed by the cms ( barring statistical fluctuations ) .    in a simple model",
    ", one can assume both the dirac and majorana masses of the @xmath101 sector of the heavy neutrino mass matrices to be flavor diagonal .",
    "in this case , the  small \" majorana entry @xmath69 can give the desired flavor structure to satisfy the neutrino oscillation data , without affecting the dilepton signal , as long as @xmath102 [ cf .",
    "eq .  ] . also for final states with different flavors , the ratio @xmath103 in eq",
    ".   can be different , depending on the structure of the full neutrino mass matrix   in the 3-generation case .",
    "since we are mainly interested in explaining the @xmath11 excess , we will not give a detailed description of the possible flavor structures .",
    "example fits to neutrino data can be found in  @xcite .",
    "it is also worth noticing that the same characteristic of dilepton charge content as in eq",
    ".   could emerge in the context of sm inverse seesaw without the lr symmetry , provided the mixing between light and heavy neutrinos ( typically denoted by @xmath104 in the literature ) is sizable , so that the heavy neutrinos could be produced on - shell with an observable cross section through the drell - yan process mediated by an @xmath105-channel @xmath106 boson  @xcite .",
    "however , the invariant mass pattern of the final state jets will be different , since in this case they will come from an on - shell @xmath106 decay , and not from an off - shell @xmath0 decay as in the lr case .",
    "one could also have a dominant 2-body decay @xmath107 in the lr case , if the mixing parameter @xmath108 is large  @xcite , but here we do not include this possibility , simply because this effect could be masqueraded by the hitherto unknown mixing parameter @xmath86 in the rh neutrino sector .",
    "now let us see whether our inverse seesaw lr model with tev - scale @xmath0 can emerge from a non - susy @xmath30 gut , without introducing any intermediate scales , in the same spirit as the susy version  @xcite .",
    "we find it is possible , if the particle content given above is supplemented by two weyl fermion triplets @xmath109 and an extra real scalar multiplet @xmath110 under @xmath111 , all with masses in the tev scale . the triplet fermions @xmath112 could be assumed to have come from a * 45 * -dimensional fermion multiplet of @xmath30 , with its remaining components at the gut scale . similarly the color - octet scalar @xmath113 could originate from a * 210 * -dimensional @xmath30 scalar multiplet which is often used to break the @xmath30 gauge symmetry . the evolution of the gauge couplings is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] , where we have chosen the @xmath3 symmetry - breaking scale such that @xmath114 tev , as preferred by the various excesses alluded to above ( see next section ) . in figure",
    "[ fig1 ] , we have evolved the gauge couplings @xmath115 from @xmath116 to @xmath117 by the sm one - loop @xmath118-functions @xmath119 . at @xmath117 ,",
    "the symmetry expands to @xmath111 with all the sm fermions transforming as lr multiplets together with the new postulated fields above .",
    "the one - loop @xmath118-functions in this case are given by @xmath120 .",
    "the couplings unify around @xmath121 gev , which easily satisfies the proton decay constraints .",
    ", width=264 ]    we note some salient features of this model :    \\(i ) @xmath122 which implies @xmath123 .",
    "this can be implemented by breaking @xmath54-parity at a higher scale  @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) unification with this particle content predicts @xmath124 .",
    "this is still consistent with what is required to fit all the observed excesses ( see next section ) . note",
    "that in our case , there is a lower limit on @xmath125 set by the matching condition @xmath126 , and therefore , it is not possible to choose @xmath127 , unlike in earlier analyses  @xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) a detailed fermion mass and mixing fit can be done the same way as in  @xcite , since the features relevant to fermion masses are similar in both models . also note that our model is consistent with the low energy constraints coming from @xmath128 and @xmath129 systems  @xcite , which roughly imply @xmath130 .",
    "moreover , the @xmath131 boson mass predicted by these models is expected to be larger than @xmath32 , thus making it consistent with the current lhc bounds on @xmath131 mass  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the @xmath0 contributions to lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) processes like @xmath132 and @xmath133 conversion rates , as well as the muon @xmath134 are well within the current limits for small @xmath135 , which is anyway desirable in our model to explain the absence of an excess in the @xmath136 and @xmath137 channels in the cms search  @xcite .",
    "a detailed investigation of the model predictions for these lfv observables will be given elsewhere .",
    "\\(iv ) the rh fermion triplet @xmath138 of the model may act as the dark matter of the universe  @xcite provided there is an additional @xmath139 symmetry under which only the fermion triplet is odd , thus forbidding its coupling to the sm fermions and thereby making it stable .",
    "the lh component will rapidly self - annihilate due to its couplings to the sm gauge and higgs bosons and will not affect the evolution of early universe .",
    "\\(v ) the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe could be explained via leptogenesis due to the out - of - equilibrium decay of the heavy majorana neutrinos . unlike the type - i seesaw case with @xmath140  @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath0-induced washout processes in this model are expected to be under control  @xcite for @xmath32 around 2 tev .",
    "a detailed quantitative analysis of the lepton asymmetry solving the relevant boltzmann equations will be postponed to a future work .",
    "finally , we explore the viable model parameter space which can simultaneously fit all the observed excesses in @xmath11 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath141 resonance searches . we calculate the @xmath0-production cross section at nlo using the feynrules  @xcite implementation of the lrsm  @xcite in madgraph  @xcite with nnpdf2.3 pdf sets  @xcite .",
    "we find @xmath142 fb for @xmath114 tev and @xmath143 .",
    "the relevant decay widths of @xmath0 are given in the appendix .",
    "for the @xmath11 excess , the total cross section can be fitted well with @xmath144  @xcite . in our model , @xmath145 at tev - scale fixed by unification requirements , but we have the freedom in @xmath146 without much restriction from neutrino oscillation data due to the inverse seesaw structure in eq .  .",
    "this also allows us to choose a small @xmath135 to explain the absence of @xmath136 and @xmath137 excesses , as well as to satisfy the lfv constraints in the @xmath147 sector .",
    "the most important aspect of the @xmath11 excess in our model is explaining the observed ratio of 1/13 for the same - sign versus opposite - sign dilepton events  @xcite . from eq .  , we derive the allowed parameter space in the @xmath148 plane satisfying this constraint , as shown in figure  [ fig2 ] ( green shaded regions ) .",
    "we have also demanded that in this allowed region , both the heavy neutrino masses @xmath149 contributing to the @xmath11 signal are above @xmath150 and at least 100 gev smaller than @xmath32 , otherwise the signal efficiency after satisfying the cms selection cuts  @xcite drops substantially and can not explain the excess with the given production cross section .    for explaining the diboson and dijet excesses , we use the signal cross section values from a recent fit  @xcite : @xmath151 fb , @xmath152 fb , @xmath153 fb and @xmath154 fb , together with the selection efficiencies quoted in the corresponding experimental analyses . note",
    "that since we have the additional decay modes @xmath155 , as compared to the analysis in  @xcite where @xmath156 was assumed to forbid this channel , all the @xmath0 branching ratios in our case will depend on the heavy neutrino masses . in particular ,",
    "since the branching ratios to the diboson and dijet channels are somewhat reduced , it is now possible to fit the excesses in these channels with a relatively larger @xmath125 value , as dictated by unification in our case .",
    "the preferred regions in the @xmath148 plane satisfying the diboson ( shaded gray ) and dijet ( shaded blue ) excesses are shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "it is clear that there exists a large parameter space simultaneously fitting all the excesses , while being consistent with gauge coupling unification , as well as other low - energy constraints .",
    "the only mild fine - tuning needed is to make @xmath157 .",
    "parameter space .",

    "<S> we show that the excess events observed in a number of recent lhc resonance searches can be simultaneously explained within a non - supersymmetric left - right inverse seesaw model for neutrino masses with @xmath0 mass around 1.9 tev . </S>",
    "<S> the minimal particle content that leads to gauge coupling unification in this model predicts @xmath1 at the tev - scale , which is consistent with data . </S>",
    "<S> the extra color - singlet , @xmath2-triplet fermions required for unification can be interpreted as the dark matter of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> future measurements of the ratio of same - sign to opposite - sign dilepton events can provide a way to distinguish this scenario from the canonical cases of type - i and inverse seesaw , i.e. provide a measure of the relative magnitudes of the dirac and majorana masses of the right - handed neutrinos in the @xmath3-doublet of the left - right symmetric model . </S>"
