    "the risk for space travelers due to solar radiation , as well as galactic cosmic rays , has been studied extensively for nearly four decades , but the predictability and frequency of potentially lethal doses of high - energy solar radiation is still far from understood .",
    "a long series of studies suggest that the most energetic solar proton events ( spes ) @xcite can produce lethal biological doses that require careful consideration of radiation risks for manned space travel ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the august 1972 spe , often taken as the standard high - fluence event for protection studies , was not an isolated anomaly .",
    "the february 1956 , november 1960 , october 1989 , and october - november 2003 events produced solar - particle fluxes sufficiently large that an astronaut on the moon protected by only a spacesuit would likely have perished , and many events approaching these fluences have been recorded @xcite .",
    "the durations of these events ( many hours , see @xcite ) are large enough that evacuation to shelter would prevent serious exposure to an astronaut on an eva .",
    "observations of associated lightspeed precursors ( photon flares and cme eruptions ) , while not always available for the strongest spes @xcite , could allow further time for escape .    given the number of studies that have taken on the computational difficulties of the propagation of solar cosmic rays in the inner heliosphere and the resulting biological doses , it is surprising that the simpler study of the effects of ionizing photons , in particular x - rays from solar flares @xcite , have not been considered .",
    "it is easy to show that the fluence from the most energetic hard x - ray flares of the last 50 years would result in an amount of energy absorbed per gram of tissue larger than the lethal dose for an unprotected human at 1 au .",
    "acute doses for various biological endpoints are well studied , especially because of their relevance to oncological research .",
    "the frequency of very energetic flares is similar to that of the most energetic spes ; their durations are so small that evacuation is much more problematic ; and there are no early and reliable precursors that can be used to predict their onset as in the case of spes .",
    "furthermore , the shielding requirements are nontrivial and somewhat different from those for solar energetic particles , preferring material of high atomic number , in contrast to the mostly polymer construction of current spacesuit designs .",
    "bone surrounding blood - forming marrow might mitigate hematological effects , but the risk of carcinogenesis remains significant .",
    "we calculate here the expected doses from energetic solar x - ray flares and use their observed frequency - fluence relation to estimate the probability per unit time of a hazardous flare exposure .",
    "solar flare photons span energies between 10@xmath1 and 10@xmath2 kev @xcite .",
    "rhessi observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show that the spectrum of hard x - rays ( hxrs ) from solar flares extends to energies as low as 1025 kev , where `` hard '' refers to the power - law part of the spectrum produced by particle acceleration rather than thermal processes .",
    "the hxr spectrum is usually fit by the form @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the range of the estimated power - law index ( log - log slope ) @xmath4 is large for hxr flare spectra , with @xmath5 and a median around 3.5 .",
    "additionally , a small correlation between @xmath4 and total x - ray output has been suggested by rhessi @xcite .",
    "x - class solar flares ( the most energetic flares ) have typical durations of about 530 min @xcite , with the more energetic flares tending to last longer . as with spectral slope ,",
    "flare durations vary widely , but even with the longest of these durations the dose should be considered acute ( i.e. effects have rapid onset ) , in contrast to low - level , extended exposure to galactic cosmic rays .",
    "the acute lethal dose is almost always independent of dose rate @xcite , so we assume that the nonlethal acute dose depends on total fluence , not flux , and hence on the flare total energy release .",
    "the total photon energy release @xmath6 in flares is difficult to estimate and varies by at least a factor of 10@xmath7 , but a large number of studies using euv , soft x - ray ( sxr ) , and hxr satellite events roughly agree that the differential distribution @xmath8 of flare energy releases is a power law with index about @xmath9 to @xmath10 over at least six orders of magnitude in total energy release @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the largest x - ray releases observed among contemporary solar flares is @xmath11 erg @xcite .",
    "eleven x - class flares occurred during the extraordinary solar outbursts between 18 october 2003 and 5 november 2003 @xcite , with sxr releases in the goes 18 ( 210 kev ) band peaking at @xmath12 erg for the largest bursts .",
    "observations using the sorce instrument s total irradiance monitor yielded a total flare energy at all wavelengths for the 28 october flare of @xmath13 erg @xcite . radiation and",
    "charged particles from these flares compressed the earth s van allen belt to within 20,000 km of the surface @xcite , damaged the orbiting mars odyssey communication instruments , and reduced polar ozone levels significantly @xcite .",
    "although most of our calculations are for a 10@xmath14 erg flare , it seems likely that much more energetic flares than considered here have occurred .",
    "such flares have been serendipitously discovered in other solar - like stars with otherwise normal characteristics @xcite .",
    "upper limits on proton fluences inferred from cosmogenic isotopes in lunar samples @xcite , tree ring records of @xmath15c @xcite , and the statistics of impulsive nitrate events @xcite suggest that the frequency - fluence relation steepens for high - energy particle fluences above about 10@xmath16 @xmath17 , probably due to streaming - limited fluxes associated with self - confinement by ion - wave interactions @xcite . in contrast , no such limit , empirical or theoretical , has been established for photon flares , other than an upper limit to avoid divergence of total energy @xcite .",
    "we adopt a mean recurrence time for 10@xmath18 erg flares of 10 yr , agreeing with the estimate of @xcite and broadly consistent with the dozen or so 10@xmath1410@xmath18 erg events that have been observed since goes soft x - ray monitoring began in 1976 . the average hxr frequency - energy release statistic @xmath8 is taken as a power law in @xmath6 , with log - log slope @xmath19 .",
    "thus , we take the mean time between events of energy release @xmath20 ( in units of 10@xmath14 erg ) as @xmath21",
    "for our calculations , solar flare photon number spectra are assumed to be distributed as power laws , @xmath22 , with @xmath23 ( see above ) .",
    "the flare spectrum is assumed to extend from 10 kev to 511 kev .",
    "the 10 kev lower limit is taken to simulate the hxr flares , which often begin to flatten to a thermal form around this energy , while the upper limit is set high enough that a negligible number of incident photons are at higher energies , even for the shallowest spectra ( lowest @xmath4 ) .",
    "henceforth , total energy release quantities refer only to the energy between 10 and 511 kev .",
    "we transport the incident ionizing radiation using a single - scattering approximation .",
    "the primary interaction processes at x - ray energies are photoelectric absorption and compton scattering .",
    "the photoabsorption opacity is much larger , so the radiative transfer can be computed by employing an effective opacity , in which both compton scattering and photoabsorption are treated as absorption processes . by including the compton cross section in the opacity , we in effect assume that the material is optically thin to compton scattering , such that at most a photon will scatter no more than once before exiting .",
    "errors incurred by this approximation are negligible , as we have verified using monte carlo simulations @xcite . the compton - scattering coefficient was computed exactly using the klein - nishina formula , while the photoabsorption cross section was approximated using the empirical form of @xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the atomic number of the target nucleus and @xmath26 is the energy of the incident photon in units of 511 kev .",
    "we found this form to be an excellent fit to cross section data for light elements and for energies higher than the k edge .",
    "the k edges of carbon and aluminum are at ( respectively ) 284 and 1560 ev @xcite and are well below our spectral cutoff energy of 10 kev , so our calculation is in the energy regime that is consistent with the cross section fit .",
    "the effective opacity of the material is then @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the mean atomic mass in amu of the target material , @xmath29 is the mass of a hydrogen atom , @xmath25 is its atomic number , and @xmath30 is the compton cross section .",
    "the single - scattering approximation results in exponential attenuation of the incident fluence . in terms of the effective opacity @xmath31 and the areal density @xmath32 ( g @xmath17 ) of the shielding material , the attenuated energy fluence @xmath33 is @xmath34.\\ ] ]    after transport through the shielding material",
    ", the photon fluence is converted to a biological dose by assuming that the remaining radiation is absorbed by pure water .",
    "much of the damage by ionizing radiation is thought to be `` indirect , '' involving chemical reactions initiated by energy deposited in the bulk cell water or first hydration layer , rather than `` direct '' ionization of dna @xcite , although this terminology is now recognized as an oversimplification @xcite .",
    "we then estimate the dose as a function of areal density of the shielding by integrating the attenuated incident photon energy spectrum over the effective opacity of water @xmath35 ( calculated using the single - scattering method above ) : @xmath36 where the attenuated fluence @xmath33 is given above , and the limits of integration are in kev .",
    "this is essentially the skin dose .",
    "to estimate risks to humans exposed to solar flare x - rays , critical levels of acute radiation exposure for various types of health outcomes ( e.g. hematologic damage , organ failure , cancer , and lethality ) are needed .",
    "particularly useful is the minimum dose at which a given enhancement in occurrence of a disease relative to the average population occurs .",
    "we use dosimetry units for which 1 gray = 100 rad = 10@xmath37 erg g@xmath1 absorbed .",
    "for reference , a chest x - ray delivers around 0.1 mgy .",
    "since x - ray photons have small linear energy transfer , @xmath38 , their `` quality factor '' or `` biological effectiveness '' is very close to unity , independent of energy , so dose in gy is approximately the dose in sievert .",
    "the duration of exposures to flare x - rays of large fluence will be relatively short ( 1060 min in most cases ) , so we restrict the discussion to evidence concerning acute human radiation - syndrome data .",
    "at doses above about 0.5 gy , summaries of a number of sources of data relevant to acute radiation syndrome in humans are available @xcite , as well as detailed specialized studies @xcite .",
    "there is general agreement that severe damage , primarily hematologic and without assured recovery , occurs around 1 gy . estimates of the whole - body acute lethal dose vary from 2 to 5 gy @xcite .",
    "an upper limit to the radiation risk dose in an exposed individual is the ratio of the average spontaneous rate of mutations over a large number of genes to the induced mutation rate per gy for low - let ( linear energy transfer ) irradiation , recognizing that the mutation rate is highly variable among loci ; this ratio is the mutation doubling dose .",
    "an estimate using 135 human genes for spontaneous rates and 35 mouse genes for induced rates @xcite gives a doubling dose of 0.8 gy .",
    "this dose is for chronic ( i.e. continual ) irradiation , and a dose rate reduction of a factor of three is usually assumed for acute doses , suggesting a doubling dose of 0.3 gy for acute irradiation .",
    "however this estimate remains uncertain and subject to various definitions @xcite .",
    "most work on x - ray and gamma - ray radiation risk to exposed individuals ( not genetic disease endpoints ) comes from studies of carcinogenesis .",
    "there is little doubt that the incidence of cancer due to radiation - induced genomic instability rises with acute dose above 0.20.3 gy . below this dose",
    "there is continued debate whether there is a `` linear - no - threshold '' relation between risk and ionizing - radiation dose , or whether doses below about 0.1 gy result in `` adaptive response '' causing endogenous dna damage prevention and immune stimulation @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it is also likely that risk at low doses is larger than the linear - no - threshold extrapolation , even increasing with decreasing dose , because of bystander effects , as reviewed in @xcite .",
    "the situation is further complicated by the existence of a significant fraction of humans with predisposing mutations to cancers induced by ionizing radiation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is certain that mutations , often at significant loci @xcite , chromosomal abnormalities in blood lymphocytes @xcite , and clustered dna damage @xcite occur at much smaller doses in the range 0.01 to 0.1 gy , but their impact on health risk has been difficult to assess because of the evidence for adaptive response at low doses .",
    "a compelling discussion by @xcite argues that there is good human epidemiological evidence for increased cancer risk at an acute x - ray or gamma - ray dose of 0.05 gy , and reasonable evidence for enhanced risk above 0.01 gy , although the risk enhancement is in the 110% range .",
    "acute critical doses for significantly increased risk for other disease endpoints may also be of order 0.1 gy or less , especially for hematological diseases .",
    "for example , the summary of delayed somatic ( i.e. bodily ) effects due to acute doses by @xcite indicates that gastrointestinal tract syndrome ( leading to loss of digestion ability , bleeding ulcers , and diarrhea ) sets in at 0.1 gy for x - rays .",
    "the risk of a particular _ genetic_-disease endpoint per gy of irradiation is more difficult to estimate , since the disease - specific induced mutation rate varies greatly and most models assume mutation - selection equilibrium",
    ". inspection of risk estimates in humans and animal models for a number of genetic - disease classes that include 26 human disorders encompassing 135 genes @xcite indicates that risks for genetic - disease endpoints at 0.1 gy due to acute x - ray doses are probably much smaller than the risks for somatic disease in an exposed individual discussed earlier .",
    "these estimates include corrections for potential recoverability and concentrate on low - let radiation , x - rays and @xmath39-rays .",
    "the results are given for chronic irradiation , even though they are based on experiments with high dose - rate irradiation .",
    "the `` dose - rate reduction factor '' for acute doses is believed to be roughly a factor of three , a factor which is well established in studies of specific - locus mutations . using this factor to correct the results",
    ", it is found that risks in terms of the excess over an average population for acute doses are typically 1% per gy .",
    "but these results were typically obtained at equivalent acute doses in the range 0.53 gy , so linearity of the above risk with dose can not be assumed .",
    "a review of evidence for enhanced mutation rates in human populations exposed to doses as low as 0.25 gy in the chernobyl accident and nuclear weapons tests in kazakhstan is given in @xcite .",
    "but the main point is that the risks for genetic disease endpoints at 0.1 gy might be smaller than the risk for somatic disease in an exposed individual .    given that the linear increase of cancer risk with dose for acute doses above 0.1 gy seems unequivocal and that the threshold for delayed somatic - disease endpoints appears to also be about 0.1 gy , we adopt this biological dose as an upper limit for significant risk increase due to x - rays , with the understanding that enhanced risk for several disease endpoints , but especially cancer @xcite , may still be significant at lower doses .",
    "an important unresolved point is that adoption of a critical dose depends on the risk enhancement that one is willing to accept ; our reading of the literature suggests a 10% enhancement in potentially fatal disease endpoints at 0.1 gy , and less than 1% enhancement for genetic disease endpoints at this dose .",
    "we can now compare our adopted upper dose limit of 0.1 gy with that received behind polymer shielding , which is representative of current spacesuit design , such as the space shuttle extravehicular mobility unit @xcite .",
    "we use pure carbon as a proxy for the mostly polymer construction of spacesuits because only the carbon atoms in polymers significantly absorb x - rays . the results , assuming a 10@xmath14 erg solar flare , are shown in fig .  [ fig : eva1 ] .",
    "erg x - ray flare as a function of flare spectral index , @xmath4 , and areal density , @xmath32 .",
    "the dose is roughly independent of @xmath4 for shields with areal densities smaller than about 2 g @xmath17 . for larger shielding columns",
    ", the dose becomes sensitive to the spectral shape because more of the incident spectrum is attenuated , and hence reshaped , before being absorbed by the model water column .",
    "areal densities of polymer in excess of 2 g @xmath17 are needed to reduce the x - ray dose to below our adopted maximum acceptable acute dose of 0.1 gy . ]    the typical areal densities of spacesuit components ( @xmath40 0.51.5 g @xmath17 ) provide little protection during a large solar flare .",
    "a relatively common 10@xmath14 erg flare would deliver over 0.2 gy behind the current spacesuit  twice our adopted upper limit .",
    "a thicker spacesuit could reduce this dose to 0.1 gy , but larger flares do occur , albeit less often . bolstering spacesuits simply decreases the frequency of dangerous doses and does not eliminate the threat .",
    "what is the likelihood of being exposed to doses above 0.1 gy ? if we use for simplicity a typical flare spectral index of 3.5 , we find that the approximate dose behind polymer shielding of areal density @xmath41 g @xmath17 is @xmath42 where @xmath20 is the flare energy release in units of 10@xmath14 erg , and @xmath32 is the areal density of the shielding material in g @xmath17 . using the flare energy - recurrence frequency relation given in the discussion of flare properties to eliminate @xmath20 , the mean time between flares delivering _ at least _ a given dose @xmath43 behind an polymer shield of areal density @xmath32 is @xmath44 where @xmath43 is the dose in units of 0.1 gy .",
    "if we then assume that time between flare events is typically much larger than the duration of exposure and that flares occur at random , the probability of exposure to a dose of at least the critical dose is @xmath45 per hour of eva .",
    "so in just 100 hours of eva in the current spacesuit , an astronaut would accumulate a 10% risk of a dangerous exposure to solar flare x - rays .",
    "the previous section discusses only the risk due to photons from flares .",
    "the risk due to solar energetic particle events ( spes ) is certainly not negligible , but we argue that the risk during evas is significantly smaller than estimated here for hard x - rays from flares .",
    "the largest spes , such as the 14 july 2000 , feb 1956 , and aug 1972 events , had 1 au fluences in the range 10@xmath1610@xmath46 @xmath17 @xcite , although per - particle energies were 100 times smaller than for galactic cosmic rays .",
    "@xcite estimated the incidence of flares that produce spes with 1 au doses greater than 1 gy as about one per decade , similar to what we estimate for 10@xmath18 erg photon flares that produce 2 gy doses , as shown in the fig .",
    "a similar frequency for spes with fluences above 10@xmath16 @xmath17 can be derived from the recorded number of large events @xcite , nitrate ice core reconstruction covering several centuries @xcite , and probability models @xcite .",
    "in contrast , 10@xmath14 erg x - ray flares that also require substantial shielding are about 50 times more frequent .",
    "spacesuits are the last line of defense until shelter is reached , so exposures during a flare will depend on the ratio of the time to reach shelter to the time to deliver the total fluence .",
    "figure [ fig : eva2 ] shows that the doses behind aluminum shielding are significantly smaller than that received inside spacesuits of the same areal density because of the strong dependence of the photoabsorption cross section on atomic number of the target material . but x - ray flares leave only 1030 min to reach shelter before the total fluence is delivered .",
    "hard x - ray flares are impulsive , with rise times of minutes or less .",
    "the time to withdraw to adequately shielded shelter is very small . a reliable energetic hard x - ray flare precursor signature occurring more than an hour before the flare maximum",
    "would be needed for this purpose .",
    "there are many signatures that have been proposed as flare precursors @xcite , such as uv brightening , soft x - ray enhancements , microwave radio signatures , h@xmath47 filament disturbances , strong magnetic shear , sunspot motions , and the beginnings of chromospheric mass ejections ( cmes ) , whose onset is now known to slightly precede an associated flare on average .",
    "most of these precursors are only observable for less than a few minutes before the onset of the flare , so do not give sufficient warning and would require elaborate monitoring systems .",
    "some radio precursors , such as polarization signatures , are observed up to tens of minutes before a flare , but are not observed in the majority of flares .",
    "similarly , for all precursor signatures there are flares seen without the precursor and observations of `` precursors '' that are not followed by a flare ; no precursors are necessary and sufficient @xcite .",
    "even more seriously , none of these precursors are predictors of the energy release of the flare itself , so given the large frequency of flares that pose no biological hazard , use of these precursors would likely result in a large false - alarm rate .",
    "most probabilistic approaches for flare prediction are based on a combination of historical rate of flaring for a given sunspot classification group and additional information such as shear , magnetic topology , and previous large - flare activity @xcite .",
    "a more recent bayesian method relies only on flare event statistics @xcite .",
    "these methods are most suited for probabilistic prediction of quantities like the number of flares of a certain class in a given year , but not for eva hazard warnings .",
    "for example , the bayesian method would have predicted a 20% probability for an x - class flare on 4 nov 2003 , using data up to one day before , including a highly clustered series of strong and weak flares in the week before , yet actually the most energetic flare in several decades was about to occur @xcite , a flare almost an order of magnitude more energetic than the model flare used in the calculations reported here .",
    "such prediction algorithms might be useful for policies requiring no evas in windows of a week or so , when the probability of a large flare can be somewhat more accurately estimated , but this could greatly curtail manned exploration , depending on where the threshold for significance is placed and the reliability of the prediction . for example , less reliable predictions would require lower thresholds for significance ( and thus higher alarm rates ) to maintain acceptable risk levels .",
    "because of diffusive propagation through the heliosphere , the first particles from spes arrive at 1 au more than an hour after the initiating event ( when one is observed ) and take hours to reach hazardous fluences ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.7 , 12.9 ) @xcite .",
    "this allows a simple and effective retreat strategy based on flare , cme , or even sunspot precursors ( although not all energetic spes are associated with flares ; @xcite ) . consequently ,",
    "x - ray flares are more dangerous during evas",
    ".      one simple protection solution would be to include a 23 m@xmath48 shield of high-@xmath25 material , such as aluminum , in eva rover designs .",
    "heavy elements more efficiently stop x - rays than light elements , and no significant secondary radiation is produced by x - rays , so we believe a material such as aluminum to be optimal for this purpose . using the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : eva2 ] , an aluminum shield thick enough to protect against a 10@xmath14 erg flare would have an areal density of at least 7 kg per square meter of shielding ; for a 10@xmath18 erg flare the mass requirement would be 70 kg m@xmath49 . additionally the shield would have to be articulated or detachable , in order to provide protection regardless of the sun s position in the sky .",
    "this shield would be employed during evacuation , since it would be useless or even dangerous if a large spe followed the flare , since the high-@xmath25 composition would enhance the radiation dose from secondary particle production within the shield .",
    "erg x - ray flare as a function of flare spectral index , @xmath4 , and areal density , @xmath32 .",
    "aluminum has a higher atomic number than carbon ( 13 vs. 6 ) and absorbs x - rays much more efficiently . only 2 g @xmath17 of aluminum shielding would be required to reduce the dose to below 0.05 gy for a 10@xmath14 erg flare . ]",
    "the risk to astronauts due to solar flare x - rays was before now mostly unknown , in contrast to the highly studied effects of particle radiation , such as solar protons and galactic cosmic rays .",
    "here we have calculated the transport of ionizing radiation through spacesuit material and present acute biological doses due to x - rays that an astronaut could receive if a large solar flare occurs during an eva .",
    "based on the studies of somatic and genetic disease risks due to acute doses of ionizing radiation , we adopt a minimum hazardous dose of x - rays of 0.1 gy and find that the risk of receiving at least 0.1 gy from an x - ray flare is roughly 10% per 100 hours of accumulated eva .",
    "the onset and duration of x - ray flares is rapid enough and possible precursors are unreliable enough that avoidance would be difficult .",
    "the simplest solution for x - ray protection on rover - based evas could be the inclusion of a mobile body shield to supplement the shielding provided by the spacesuit until shelter can be reached .",

    "<S> solar hard x - ray flares can expose astronauts on lunar and deep space extravehicular activities ( evas ) to dangerous acute biological doses . </S>",
    "<S> we combine calculations of radiative transfer through shielding materials with subsequent transfer through tissue to show that hazardous doses , taken as @xmath0 gy , should occur with a probability of about 10% per 100 hours of accumulated eva inside current spacesuits . </S>",
    "<S> the rapid onset and short duration of x - ray flares and the lack of viable precursor events require strategies for quick retreat , in contrast to solar proton events , which usually take hours to deliver significant fluence and can often be anticipated by flares or other light - speed precursors . </S>",
    "<S> our results contrast with the view that only particle radiation poses dangers for human space exploration . </S>",
    "<S> heavy - element shields provide the most efficient protection from x - ray flares , since x - rays produce no significant secondary radiation . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate doses due to x - ray flares behind aluminum shields and estimate the required shield masses to accompany eva rovers . </S>"
