    "in recent years , attempts to understand the origin of the accelerated cosmic expansion @xcite have led to a large number of theoretical models @xcite . apart from the current standard model , which assumes that the acceleration is caused by a cosmological constant @xmath1 ( hence the name @xmath1-cold - dark - matter , or @xmath1cdm ) ,",
    "these model can be roughly put in two categories : dark energy  which replaces @xmath1 by some dynamical field , and modified gravity  which assumes that there is no exotic matter species beyond the standard cdm model but gravity is not described by general relativity ( gr ) on cosmological scales ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for some recent reviews ) .",
    "some of the models in the latter class , such as the chameleon theory @xcite , of which the well - known @xmath0 gravity @xcite is an example , have been active research topics in recent years .",
    "ultimately , any new cosmological model or theory of gravity should be put to rigorous tests against observational data . for this reason , a number of tests have been proposed or applied in the past to examine the viability of the models ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for some recent reviews in @xmath0 gravity ) .",
    "the present paper shall follow the same line to propose a test using observations of galaxy clusters .",
    "galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally bound and virialised objects in our universe .",
    "the most massive clusters observed today typically have masses in the range of @xmath6 , of which the dominant component is dark matter .",
    "these are homes to galaxies , stars and eventually lives , which together hold the vast majority of the information that can be extracted from cosmological and astrophysical observations . in dark energy or modified gravity theories , the different cosmic expansion histories and gravitational laws between particles",
    "can have sizeable effects on how the clusters form and evolve .",
    "@xcite , based on this observation , have placed constraints on @xmath0 gravity using cluster abundance data . in theories such as @xmath0 gravity ,",
    "massive and massless particles feel different strengths of gravity , thus allowing these theories to be constrained by comparing the so - called dynamical and lensing masses of clusters @xcite . combining with lensing observations , @xcite obtained even stronger constraints on @xmath0 gravity .    given the abundant information associated with these rich objects , one expects that they will provide a wealth of other potential tests of new cosmological models .",
    "the arrival of the era of precision cosmology lends this perspective both more interest and more support . in this paper",
    ", we propose to utilise the observationally inferred mass fraction of hot x - ray emitting gas in galaxy clusters as a new test of gravity .",
    "the gas fraction in clusters , @xmath7 , is a well established and understood observable in the standard cosmological model , which can be used to place strong constraints on background cosmology ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and following - up works , for some examples ) . the basic assumptions ( or approximations ) are ( i ) clusters are in hydrostatic equilibrium between thermal pressure and gravity and ( ii ) as the largest objects in the universe , the cluster baryon fraction , dominantly contributed by gas , is a faithful representation of the cosmological average baryon fraction @xmath2 , in which @xmath8 and @xmath9 are respectively the fractional mass density of baryons and all matter @xcite . using ( i ) , one can find , from the observed x - ray temperature and surface brightness profiles , the mass profiles of baryons and all matter inside a cluster , and consequently @xmath10  the profile of gas fraction . combined with ( ii ) , this can have a say about @xmath9 provided that @xmath8 is measured elsewhere ( e.g. , from big bang nucleosynthesis or the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) ) .",
    "in modified gravity theories , the hydrostatic equilibrium inside clusters is changed as a result of the different law of gravity .",
    "hence , a cluster can have a higher dynamical mass , with the same baryonic mass inside , leading to a @xmath11 that is lower than the true @xmath7 which is related to @xmath2 .",
    "if a cosmologist wishes to infer @xmath2 from @xmath12 in a modified gravity universe , a correction has to be done to the end result , which can lead to inconsistency with other observational determinations of @xmath2 , and therefore a constraint on the gravity theory .",

    "this is , to be clear , in the framework of standard gr .          in many modified gravity theories , including @xmath0 gravity , the way in which the trajectories of massive test bodies ",

    "this change of the dynamics of test bodies is sometimes described as the change of the _ dynamical mass _ of matter .",
    "massless particles , such as photons , could behave differently : in some theories , such as the galileon model @xcite and the k - mouflage model @xcite , photons can also feel a different mass of matter , but in other models , for example @xmath0 gravity and the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* dgp ) model , photon trajectories depend on the matter distribution in essentially the same way as in gr , since the conformal coupling does not affect geodesics of massless particles . for distinction ,",
    "the mass felt by photons is usually called the _ lensing mass_. the differences in the dynamical and lensing masses of galaxy clusters have been used to constrain @xmath0 gravity in , e.g. , @xcite    as mentioned above , gas particles , like dark matter particles and galaxies , do feel the dynamical mass of a cluster . in @xmath0 gravity , the same cluster can have a dynamical mass @xmath109 times its value in gr .",
    "this maximum enhance factor of 1/3 , however , is not necessarily realised in all clusters , because of the chameleon screening @xcite .",
    "the screening helps to reduce the difference between the dynamical and lensing masses , especially for more massive clusters .",
    "consequently , constraints relying on the dynamical masses of clusters are in general weaker than those coming from astrophysical considerations .",

    "it is difficult to tell whether one observes a cluster of true mass @xmath110 in gr , or one with a smaller mass in @xmath0 gravity , since both have the same dynamical masses .",
    "this has motivated @xcite to propose the concept of _ effective haloes_. briefly speaking , the idea is to redefine the right - hand side of the modified poisson equation in @xmath0 gravity , eq .",

    ", the complicated new physics in @xmath0 gravity is absorbed into @xmath114 , and with that solved ( e.g. , in numerical simulations ) one can in principle proceed assuming gr as the true theory of gravity .",
    "@xcite , for example , show with hydrodynamical simulations that cluster gas temperatures depend only on the masses of the corresponding effective haloes , and that with certain rescaling depending on the effective halo mass the scaling relations  such as the @xmath115-@xmath110 relation with @xmath115 the x - ray luminosity  in @xmath0 gravity can be derived reliably using existing knowledge of gr .    in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : simulation ] , we present the gas temperature profiles for standard haloes in gr and effective haloes in @xmath0 gravity , both in the mass bin @xmath116 . though there are differences in the inner regions  which could be due to different halo density profiles or screening  we notice that beyond @xmath117kpc the two agree very well .",
    "@xcite find that the average gas temperatures in the two also show very good agreement , and indeed the temperature - mass relation is barely distinguishable in the two models , provided that effective haloes are used in @xmath0 gravity .",
    "the fact that the cluster gas temperatures depend on the mass of the effective haloes is as expected , since for relaxed systems the virial temperature depends on the newtonian potential , which does not distinguish between standard ( gr ) and effective ( @xmath0 gravity ) density fields . for a polytropic gas with an equation of state @xmath118 in which the constant @xmath119 , the hydrostatic equation implies that ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the temperature can be analytically expressed as a function of the potential @xmath36 .",
    "let us now consider two haloes , one identified in the standard dark matter field in a model with gr as the gravity theory , another from the effective density field in @xmath0 gravity .",

    "( [ eq : hydrostatic_spherical ] ) are the same , we conclude that @xmath121 is also the same in the haloes .",
    "this , however , does not necessarily mean that the haloes have identical gas density profiles , because we can rescale @xmath122 by a constant factor without changing @xmath121 . to confirm this , in the middle panel of fig .",

    ", we shall leave a full analysis using real cluster data for future work , and instead adopt a simplified modelling .",
    "the cluster masses are assumed to be the same , with @xmath150 , for all 42 clusters , since this is a typical value for massive x - ray clusters . the cluster s radius ( @xmath151 or @xmath152 )",
    "is taken to be @xmath153mpc and its concentration parameter , @xmath154 ( or @xmath155 ) is @xmath156 .",
    "the cluster is assumed to live on the cosmological background , so that the ratio of its effective and actual masses can be approximated as ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the background value of @xmath28 at redshift @xmath51 , and @xmath159 is the newtonian potential at the edge of an nfw halo .",

    "once this is specified , we can obtain @xmath143 , and therefore infer @xmath165 given @xmath149 and @xmath51 of a cluster .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : obom ] we show the @xmath165 result obtained from @xmath12 for 4 different cases : standard @xmath1cdm ( upper left ) , and @xmath0 gravity models with @xmath166 ( upper right ) , @xmath167 ( lower left ) and @xmath168 ( lower right ) . for comparison",

    ", the constraints on cosmological parameters such as @xmath9 would be the same in all these models .",
    "because of this , the cmb constraints are less model - dependent . ] .",
    "the results from the 42 clusters , with 1@xmath169 errors , are shown as symbols .",
    "a quick naked - eye inspection shows that the @xmath7 method and the cmb observation give compatible @xmath2 if one assumes the @xmath1cdm paradigm ( upper left ) .",
    "the @xmath0 model with @xmath171 ( lower right ) , on the other hand , leads to a significantly higher value of @xmath2 than what cmb says , and is therefore inconsistent .",
    "the other two cases are more interesting : for @xmath172 ( lower left ) , @xmath143 increases to @xmath109 at @xmath173 , while for @xmath166 ( upper right ) @xmath143 only increases to @xmath174 at @xmath175 . in both cases , however , the inferred values of @xmath2 are still substantially larger than the planck result , especially for the low-@xmath51 clusters .",
    "this shows that cluster gas fraction can be a potentially powerful test of gravity , using x - ray observations only . in such tests ,",
    "lensing data can be a useful addition , but is not necessary .     in 4 models with the same cosmic value of @xmath2 from @xcite .",
    "the models are , respectively , @xmath1cdm ( black solid line ) , and hu - sawicki @xmath4 @xmath0 model with @xmath166 ( blue dotted line ) , @xmath167 ( green dashed line ) and @xmath168 ( red dot - dashed line ) .",
    "black triangles with error bars are the @xmath7 values of the 42 clusters used in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* tab 3 ) .",
    "the blue shaded region denotes the standard deviation around the mean @xmath7 for the model with @xmath166 , for illustration , which shows that the theoretical uncertainty is roughly of the same order as current observational errors in @xmath7 ; therefore , the constraining power can be further improved if either of these uncertainties is reduced in the future.,width=332 ]    the test can be done in an alternative way . for this , we assume the value of @xmath2 obtained from cmb observations , and check what value of @xmath12 an observer would have found if living in a @xmath0 universe .",
    "the idea is that , if this value differs too much from what _ our _ observers have told us ( e.g. , in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then it would place a constraint on the extent to which the assumed @xmath0 model can deviate from standard @xmath1cdm .",
    "as in the previous case , we draw random samples of size @xmath147 for the parameters @xmath148 from which we find @xmath147 realisations of @xmath176 . then , by modelling modified gravity effects using eq .",
    "( [ eq : etaz ] ) , we compute the mean @xmath7 for the 4 models shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : obom ] , and these are shown as curves in fig .  [ fig : fgas_evol ] together with the observed values of @xmath7 from @xcite .",
    "again , we note that current data favour @xmath1cdm over all three variants of @xmath0 gravity .",
    "as clusters are less screened at late times , we find that low-@xmath51 data is more useful in constraining the model than high-@xmath51 data .",
    "in this paper , we proposed a new cosmological test of gravity , by inferring the cosmic baryon fraction from the apparent gas fractions of massive clusters , and comparing with the results from other , less model - dependent , measurements such as the cmb . in theories with a stronger gravity , the apparent gas fraction is smaller than that in @xmath1cdm for a fixed @xmath2 .",
    "reversely , if the observed value @xmath12 is fixed , we would find a higher value of @xmath2 than in gr , that can be inconsistent with the model - independent measurements . taking the hu - sawicki @xmath0 model as an example",
    ": our quick calculation shows that model parameters @xmath177 are in tension with the gas fraction data of the 42 clusters from @xcite , though a more rigorous constraint will be left for future work .",
    "@xmath7 has been a rather widly - used observable ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and its power in constraining cosmology  in particular dark energy models  is convincingly demonstrated in various previous works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the inclusion of baryons opens a new dimension for tests of gravity , since ultimately most cosmological observables can be tracked back to lights emitted by interactions involving baryons . in the mean time , the physics of the x - ray - emitting hot gas in massive clusters is relatively clean , making it easier both for the modelling and to use the observational data .",
    "as an example , the assumption that gas temperature depends on the gravitational potential and our main conclusions that ( i ) @xmath99  the true gas fraction  is _ unchanged _ with modified gravity while ( ii ) @xmath12 is _ changed _ are supported by hydrodynamical simulations in @xmath0 gravity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "some uncertainties remain in relating @xmath7 to @xmath2 , but these have been included in the error budget estimate above .",
    "furthermore , within our current state of understanding , slightly changing its modelling ( e.g. , from @xcite to @xcite ) does not change results drastically .    here",
    ", we would like to emphasise the use of effective haloes @xcite in our analysis .",
    "though the idea has a similar origin as that of the dynamical mass of halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there are fundamental differences .",
    "dynamical mass is a certain attribute of a given halo which is defined in the standard way , while effective halo is a completely new way to define and identify haloes . given an effective halo , all gravitational effect can be calculated from gr , and in particular this means that the way in which @xmath7 is currently extracted from observational data  and the resulting @xmath7 results  can be directly used for our purpose .",
    "thus , with a little extra effort from the people who generate a halo catalogue , the analyses of end users can be made much more straightforward , and this provides an efficient bridge between simulators , theorists and observers .",
    "one may naturally wonder about the generality of this method . as a cosmological test",
    ", it relies on galaxy clusters being totally or partially unscreened . because we are talking about massive clusters which tend",
    "to be better screened , this test , like most other cosmological ones , will probably not be able to constrain @xmath163 to substantially smaller than the quoted values here .",
    "however , it does provide a fairly clean test  with good observational data available  that has the potential to place one of the strongest constraints from cosmology on @xmath0 gravity .",
    "also , one can always combine @xmath7 and other observables , such as lensing @xcite , cluster scaling relations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and cluster gas pressure profiles @xcite , to place joint , and likely stronger , constraints . in principle",
    ", the test would be more powerful if observational data for smaller galaxy clusters ( e.g. , those in the mass range @xmath178 ) and galaxy groups are included , because these objects are less screened and so gravity deviates more from gr in general .",
    "this , however , requires a better understanding of the feedbacks in different models , which are not well studied so far .",
    "the test can be applied not only to @xmath0 gravity and the more general chameleon theory , but also to similar models such as dilatons @xcite and symmetrons @xcite .",
    "these models are all featured by a universal coupling of all matter species to a scalar field , that effectively enhances the gravity for all particles ( at least in unscreened regimes ) .",
    "there are models in which only certain matter species , e.g .. dark matter , experiences the scalar coupling : therein , baryons can still feel a different gravity depending on how the dark matter particle mass evolves with time , in which case the proposed test does apply .",
    "in addition to these theories , we have mentioned above the dgp , galileon and k - mouflage models . in the first two classes ,",
    "the deviations from gr are strongly suppressed inside dark matter haloes @xcite , and so we do not expect the new test to work . for k - mouflage , as is for the so - called non - local gravity @xcite , there can be a time evolution of newton s constant inside clusters , making it possible to use this test .",
    "however , one needs to bear in mind that in many of these theories the background evolution history is also modified , and that can affect the @xmath7 test ( whether it leads to degeneracies or stronger constraints can only be told by a case - by - case study in the future ) .    as mentioned earlier ,",
    "the aim of this paper is to illustrate the main idea of using @xmath7 as a test of gravity theories , and therefore we have made a simplified estimate and have not quoted any numerical results on the confidence levels of the constrained @xmath179 .",
    "a more complete and rigorous analysis will require one to relax the simplification that all observed clusters share the same mass , radius and concentration , and use the real observational results of these for all clusters .",
    "if the cluster mass is obtained from its dynamical effects , we also need to account for the fact that different clusters may have experienced different degrees of screening , and so a more accurate modelling of the screening is needed to compute the cluster mass profile .",
    "these will be left for future work .",
    "we note that hydrodynamical simulations for modified gravity theories started to appear recently ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and such works will be useful for improving the constraining power of this test in the future .",
